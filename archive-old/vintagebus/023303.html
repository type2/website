&gt;1. I recall a little while back whenThom suggestedt the usage of one-way
&gt;rubber plug to drain water out of the bus. Anyone knows where I can go
&gt;to get replacements for the plugs?

Try wolfsburg west

&gt;2. I have already covered some bare metal section with POR-15, but I
&gt;didn't apply primer on it because the body work wasn't complete yet.
&gt;When I'm done with bodywork, how should I treat the POR-15'd areas for
&gt;better primer adhesion?

You need to mist-coat the POR-15 while it's still tacky, to give subsequent
paint or primer something to latch onto.
