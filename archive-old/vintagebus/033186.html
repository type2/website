Doesnt this sort of crap kinda make it not too enjoyable. Like today, when I 
was putting a tag frame on, I wondered to myself that how can I make it a 
little harder to take than usual. Why go to the effort to make your vehicle 
look decent and stand apart, when in the long run its the attention you get 
from the wrong people.

 I do this to my vintage plates.  I use  slightly longer than needed 
screw/bolts
 and after they are all snugged up good I zap a small bead of weld on the
 screw/bolt.  I make sure there is enough bolt to make cutting it off with a 
die
 grinder and cut off wheel possible if I need to.  This makes it impossible 
to get
 the nut off with out a cutoff wheel or dremmel tool.  I figure this will be 
too
 much work for the average punk ass thief (which BTW there were plenty of at 
Pomona
 today) and no big deal if I need to take them off someday.
