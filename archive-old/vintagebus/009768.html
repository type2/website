Most FLAPS have clamp-on auxiliary light mounts available, and they're
pretty inexpensive.

I haven't used them on my bus, but on other veehikkles they've been reliable
and durable.

&gt;&gt;  I've got the overriders on my bumpers, so I am debating how to bolt up
these lamps.  Do I drill two 13mm holes into the bumper?  I'd rather not
put holes in the bumper, but does anyone else know of a better way?  And if
so, do you have pictures of what you did so I can copy the method?  &lt;&lt;
