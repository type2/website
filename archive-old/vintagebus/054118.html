&gt; &gt;Even a shift locked car can be rolled around the corner to a carrier so
&gt; &gt;you need to cover the alternatives.
&gt;
&gt; And even a car with the wheels locked up or a &quot;boot&quot; around a wheel
&gt; can be dragged up onto a flat-bed with a sufficiently stout winch.
&gt; If they want it that bad, they won't mind a little flat spot on the
&gt; tires.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;A friend of mine here who is a &quot;cop&quot; comments that if they really want
&gt; &gt;the car they will probably get it... the trick is to make them have to
&gt; &gt;invest more time than is safe to get the car moved.
&gt;
&gt; A friend of mine with a '65 found that poor maintenance is a good
&gt; anti-theft measure.

I've a friend who, when he goes on vacation, puts his vehicles up on jack
stands and removes a couple of wheels from them.  Nobody seems to want an
obviously broken vehicle and having vehicles that are obviously being
worked on gives the impression that somone is home!  :)
