Subject: Re: [VB] EMPI

I honestly wasn't going to, as I knew how bad they were; but I was stuck
between a rock and a hard place and had to have a muffler.  That was the
only one I could get that I didn't have to order and wait for it to be
shipped here.

&gt; When are we going to see an article on the fall of the EMPI empire.
&gt; Reason for asking?  I bought an EMPI muffler today...

&gt; The public is in control of every manufacturers fate.
&gt; If you don't like their product quality, price or policy ................
&gt; simply don't buy from them or their dealers, distributors or direct.
&gt; I'm currently working on shutting down China by refusing to buy anything
&gt; made in China.
&gt; It's in your hands.
&gt; Remember it was the American buying public that nearly put Chrysler Corp
&gt; out of the Auto Business.
