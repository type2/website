Subject: Update on the new engine...

I went to work and promptly got snookered into carrying sheetrock.  Wow -
what a long, tiring day it has been.

Anyway, this morning I checked the dizzy and despite the clamp being
tightened, the dizzy could still move so I thought that was it.  I could
also hear fuel being squirted into the carbs but still no fire so just in
case, I'm going to remove the pressure regulator from the circuit and
install a T-fitting in the line and see if she'll run.  I'm also hearing a
&quot;pfft, pfft, pfft&quot; noise when I crank it up and methinks it's compression
leaking from the cylinder around the head.  I wasn't really pleased when I
put them on despite the cylinders being even across the tops.  The bores in
the cylinder were a bit bigger than the cylinders themselves and the head
could shift around just a tad.  If I have to yoink this engine and tear it
down again, I'm just gonna get some CB 044's and be done with it.  Should
have done that in the first place.

I drove the 74 Super around today and compared to the bus, that thing is a
rocket.  I drove my frustrations out today in Li'l Red and we both had a lot
of fun!

More later...
