Subject: Re: [VB] oil filler probs

&gt;  What tool are you using?  The tool with the dog ears is not the best.

Who sells this tool?  I could do with one of these as my oil filler is
loose, but the nut just won't budge.  I tried the Bugpack dog ear style tool
and just mangled the tool unfortunately.

Thanks
