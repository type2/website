Was written:
&gt; &gt; What is this rarest of the rare list and where can I get a copy?
&gt; &gt;Then Everett:
&gt; I think that's a joke.

I believe the &quot;Rarest of the Rare&quot; List was sold on E-Bay late in 1999,
after it had undergone an excruciatingly exact &quot;Rotisserie Restoration&quot;.
It brought between $23,500.00 and $24,000.00 barely meeting &quot;reserve&quot;.
The &quot;Rarest of the Rare&quot; List was bought by a list broker who, while knowing
nothing about VW Lists, had earlier heard of a &quot;Vintage Bus List&quot; which had
been sold for several thousand dollars more after being discovered in an old
&quot;Dr. Pepper&quot; Ice Chest strapped to Brian Wittling's sub hatch Westy.
Rumor is that there is a &quot;Almost as Rare&quot; list currently in a time capsule
to be opened long after the last salvageable Type II has been sold either to
a Japanese guy for a mall decoration in Tokyo or to an Orthodontist in
Bel-Air whose daughter having grown bored with her Speedster thought it was
&quot;cute&quot;.
