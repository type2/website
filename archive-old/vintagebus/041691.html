&gt; Look at all the modern fast cars with oil coolers and intercoolers - they don't 
&gt; have scoops protruding outside the body - they're either let into the sides, 
&gt; or have openings in the front.

&gt; Anyone volunteering to cut a NACA duct into the side of their bus?  It would
&gt; have to be a barndoor in order to be a valid test subject.

NACA ducts aren't as good as stagnation-recovery scoops (the fancy name
given to conventional scoops), but they have far less drag, which is the
reason that you see them on race cars and airplanes.  To be as effective,
the NACA duct has to be larger in intake area than the SR duct.

Neither are needed for a bus.  Good seals will give much better results.
