Here's another data point for you.  I just picked up my yearly copy of 
the &quot;Old Cars Price Guide&quot; today, here's what it has for this year's 
ballpark estimates for a 1962 Deluxe Bus (doesn't say if it's with or 
without sunroof):

1--trailer queen, never driven:  $25500
2--excellent original or superior resto:  $17900
3--good amateur resto, presentable &amp; serviceable:  $10200
4--deteriorated resto, but driveable:  $5100
5--needs complete resto, but not wrecked:  $3060
6--parts car:  $1020

So maybe your bus is somewhere between #4 and #5?

&gt; I am, sadly, preparing myself mentally to sell my 1962 15-window deluxe 
&gt; but am uncertain as to a fair price to ask. It is in need of 
&gt; restoration. It has a small amount of through rust on the floor by the 
&gt; cargo doors (garaged since I picked it up). It is a walk thru with the 
&gt; correct rear seat but later year middle with the correct hold downs. I 
&gt; have deluxe bumpers (round unfortunately), nearly all the glass plus one 
&gt; extra corner (missing rear window and one wing), rims and jail bars. It 
&gt; has the transaxle (one reduction is bad, bearing) and an engine of 
&gt; unknown condition. California registered but on inactive status.
&gt; 
&gt; I realize pricing is based entirely on what the market will bear but any 
&gt; constructive thoughts are appreciated?
