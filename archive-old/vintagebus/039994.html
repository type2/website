&gt;Check the electric fuel cutoff switch on the left side of the carb.
&gt;Sometimes they get a little loose in the carb body due to engine
&gt;vibrations. They cause intermittent idle problems when they're loose. A
&gt;drop of the lightest grade locktite will keep them from getting loose.


Or the wire does! Is it crimped on tight at both ends?
