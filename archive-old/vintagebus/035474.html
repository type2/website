&lt;&lt; &gt;We use 1972-79 MC due to the fact that the Rabbit or 1967 only bus DMC 
reservior fit on these years&lt;
  These are 85mm center-to-center.  And Volvo's work also!
 
 &gt; and the 1968-70ish will not due to differant spacing between the mounting 
holes&lt; 
  These are 100mm center-to-center.      Just a little FYI :)  &gt;&gt;
Hi Karl,
Excellant info!  Any particular year or type of Volvo resevior?  We need to 
figure if it is better than the Rabbit one which ends up just a bit forward 
in relation to the fill hole in the floor.  Thanks!  Eric&amp;Barb
