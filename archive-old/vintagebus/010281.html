My understanding is that the crank start handle you have is for an
industrial motor.  There is a matching crank start nut.  I believe the
differences are to aid in cranking it with no rear apron for support.

The extra pin does not retract as far as I know but there is a matching hole
in the nut.

&gt; I have a '56 bus, which came with a crank start handle. The handle is
&gt; different from others I have seen. The end of the handle that engages the
&gt; crank start nut has a smaller diameter shaft about 1 1/4 inches long
beyond
&gt; the crosspiece. It appears that this extension might be spring loaded,
i.e.
&gt; slides back into the main crank handle. If this is so, it's frozen. Note:
&gt; the handle appears to be hollow.
&gt;
&gt; Another idea is that the extension fits a pilot hole in the crank start
nut
&gt; however there's no such hole in the nut I have. What it boils down to is
the
&gt; handle won't engage the crank start nut because of this 1 1/4 inch
&gt; extension. Do I have the wrong handle or is something else wrong?
