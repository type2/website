Subject: Re: [VB] Double Cab Bed Floors, and Double Cab parts Help.

Hope this helps.  this applies to 59-61 DC as far as i
know.  My info comes from restring a very original
1960 DC.  Not sure about newer ones.

&gt;2.  3 interior trim panels for the backseat area

These are smooth masonite painted grey.  No texture
like the front doors &amp; kick panels.  They are screwed
in just like the rest of the panels

&gt;3.  Some of the masonite headliner pieces may be
&gt;unique to the DC

Same as #2 above.  The rear panel is one piece and
smooth.  Painted grey.  The seam is a 1&quot; piece of
masonite screwed in place.  My DC had masonite front
seam covers too.  Single cab's had metal ones i
beleive.  the 3 front top liners have texture just
line a SC.

&gt;4.  Hold-down brackets, bolts, and wing nuts for the
&gt;rear seat base

My 64 DC used 1964 erra beetle gas tank retainer clips
with middle/rear seat bolts and wing nuts.  Preaty
sure this was original.  The 1960 DC had nto back seat
so i copied the 64.

&gt;5.  You should have 2 dome lights (sometimes one is
&gt;missing), and an ashtray in the back seat area.

2 dome lights.  One about 2&quot; from the back and one in
the middle.  These are the same as all other bus's. 
No ash try for the 1960 or the 64.  I have never seen
an original DC with one either.  (Does not mean
anything though)&quot;

Hope that helped.
Matthew
