Subject: Re: [VB] soda blastin and...

A good alternative to Soda blasting (Sodium Bicarbonate) is Calcium
Carbonate (fine, powdered Marble). I'm lucky, because working in the
oilfield, I can get both easily, but it may be harder for you northerners.
I would try the local CO-OP or grain mill.  Some people use Bicarb to lower
the pH in soil/water, etc (maybe even a pool place).  The calcium carbonate
you could probably get cheap from a marble place that 'casts' custom marble
stuff.  They basically glue/epoxy calcium carbonate together to make stuff.

I know this isn't the best descriptions, but if you live in/around Louisiana
(the real LA) email me, I'll tell you where to get some.

Later
Charles

&gt; hi list
&gt;
&gt; Is soda blasting an easy to do for the home blaster??  i know its easy to
go
&gt; to the local auto part and buy blasting glass media, but what if i ask
about
&gt; Soda??  Last time i went to this auto part, i asked about powdercoating
and
&gt; flexible stainles steel fuel line and he looked at me like i was an
alien!!
&gt; Why, he never saw a mustang whith chrome all around flexible fuel line? ok
&gt; for powdercoating ...at least ive found a business to powdercoat my engine
&gt; cooling tin for... 25 $ (but it cost me 90$ to sandblast them) and they
look
&gt; awesome.
&gt;
&gt; Now if i want to buy soda media blasting, im sure they never heard about
&gt; that,can i use cow brand soda?
&gt;  hahaha maybe i could find CowBrand at club price in quantities for cheap!
&gt;
&gt; thx
&gt;
&gt; mike
