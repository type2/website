Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Headlight Eye Brows

Hey you two - break it up...

Anyway, I'm pretty sure your headlight adjustment is
slightly off.  I've been running H-4s on both my 73
Beetle and 66 Crewcab for years.  Neither blind people
nor do I have problems with the law.  If the brows are
serving a purpose, your headlights are shining too far
upwards.  BTW, in addition to the H-4s being brighter
anyway, I run 80/110 bulbs in mine.  They are actually
VERY effective at letting other people know they have
their highbeams on when approaching me.  Normally, I
don't need my highbeams on at all, basically because I
have more powerful lights on normally, and they are
adjusted perfectly.  Even got the signoff from the
local DMV, and they didn't even mention that I was
running higher wattage bulbs.

&gt; Mike,
&gt;      My head light adjustment is fine, thank you. 
&gt; Maybe your not up on 
&gt; H-4's, they put out quite a lot more light than the
&gt; sealed beams your 
&gt; running.  I guess we could say, compared to H-4's,
&gt; your a little on the dim 
&gt; side.  Maybe you should consider a set.

&gt;                          
&gt;     Peace,
&gt;
