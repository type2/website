Subject: RE: [VB] tool source

&gt;I bought a $20 floor jack from Pep Boys once - after a couple uses, the
&gt;thing lost its holding ability. Beware of those cheapo tools, especially
&gt;the ones that you might be trusting your life under.
&gt;
&gt;Jeez, if you found jack stands for $1.99/pair would you still trust 'em to
&gt;crawl under the bus? :-)

&gt;&gt; &gt;i found a floor jack at walmart for $20 , big one, and jack stands for
&gt;&gt; &gt;15,you can wrap the tops of the jackstands with an old bike tube and duct
&gt;&gt; &gt;tape to protect ,  jb
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Checker has jackstands on sale right now for $7.99 per pair.
&gt;&gt; Limit 3 pair.


They're just the same ones with usually sell for $15 - $20 per pair.  If
you trust those, then this is a good time to buy.

I'll tell you about unknown quality.  I bought a floor jack and jackstands
in the Philippines.  No returns, no guarantees, if you buy it, it's yours,
they don't want to see it again.
