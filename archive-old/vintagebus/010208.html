Subject: Fixing broken hubcap clips.

Tonight I spent a little time getting the bus prepped for the trip to the
OVWC campout and show this weekend.  I needed to change the oil so some
20w-50 was added now that we are in the hot summer months here in Nebraska
and I'm anticipating a trip to Colorado.  Pulling mountains with hot temps
will surely drive my 1776 bonkers so I figure some 20w-50 will do a good job
protecting it.

I changed the oil filter and by feel it was doing it's job.

Next was the hubcap clip repair (the part you've been waiting for.)  Now of
course this applies to the wide 5 lug rims on my 1967 bus but would include
any VW rim that was wide 5 and used the clips.  Terry Wolfe in Omaha gave me
the idea of using a bolt and nut to fix the clip with.  Of course for those
in the know, trying to use just any old bolt will result in a rim that will
not sit square on the drum once installed.  I found a couple of shallow
tapered head machines screws in the old Folgers coffee can that I keep years
worth of misc fasteners - a collection which my dad started and I continued.
I of course had to carefully chisel off the old broken clip and rivet.  Next
was taking a larger drill bit and drilling a slight taper in the existing
hole.  If you drill too deep, you'll bore a big hole clear through - can't
have that.  Finally, the new clip was installed with the nut bolt and a
little loctite.

I ruined the powder coated finish around the clip so a word of advice to all
of you - when you paint or powder coat your rims, it's almost sure as snot
that you will eventually have one break.  Do yourself a BIG favour and have
the rims prepped without the clips.  I was big on having mine done with the
clips and sure, it looks nice but when a clip breaks, you're stuck like me.
In all seriousness, on my next set of rims, I will chisel off all the old
rusty clips, chuck the rivets in the new set, and bolt on all the new clips.
That way as they break, I can replace them and it'll look like new all over
again with no damage to the finish of the rim.
