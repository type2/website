 will this tell the jet sizes?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Ken,
That will only show you that it was made for a 141 VW which is the Ghia.  As 
for the jets it is anybodys guess.  Anyone of all the DPO could have 
change/drilled the jets or even brass of the jets wears from thousands of 
gallons of fuel being squirted through them.  Which is why we ALWAYS check 
our jetting in any VW we deal with to make sure they are accurate.  Makes a 
big differance in HP, MPG, and even affects the longevity of the engine!  
Check around and see if you can get yourself a jetting tool which is kind of 
a feeler gauge set but has round sizes of pins instead of flat steel pieces.
