Subject: Number 2 cylinder

Looking for some suggestions.  I have a rebuilt engine (everything new
except the case) and just running it for the first time.  It was running a
little rough so I decided to try taking off plug wires to see if I could
figure it out.  When I take of plug wire 2 it smoothes out and sounds really
good for 3 cylinders.  I checked my 009 distributor with a timing light and
I am at 7 degrees btdc at 800 rpms and it maxes at around 25 btdc at full
throttle.  I also checked the valves after it cooled and they are good at
006.  Having the wife turn the engine for me while I watched the valves was
a hoot but it gave me a good look at the valves doing their thing and they
seemed to be ok also.  I also tried a known good wire and checked for spark
it was there.  I'm stumped and hoped someone could point me in the right
direction of what to check next.
On another note I wanted to give a big thanks to Steve Sandlin for doing
such a whiz-bang job on my bus's locks and keys.  Also thanks to the Tipper
(gotta love that type2) for providing some necessary photos and detail
shots.  Can't get enough of those.
