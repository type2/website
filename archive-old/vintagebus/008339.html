I'm almost there!! My first one was a 64, year of my birth but now my &quot;new&quot;
purchase is a year younger then me. It's a 65. I'm not that far but come to
think of it I was always attracted to older women,,,,,,well, it's time for
change.

Happy B-day Ronnie.

65 Kombi - getting there

&gt; &lt;&lt;  I was told it was a late 53 when I bought it, which would have been
&gt;  &gt; a dream being todays my birthday and I've always wanted a year of birth
