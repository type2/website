  You will recall that in our previous episode, our hero had just discovered
that his newly installed disc brake setup interfered with the wheel.

On Monday morning I called Wolfgang Int'l and described my situation. The
young man on the other end was quite familiar with the problem. He stated
that the caliper castings were quite variable, some interfered while some
did not. He instructed me to grind off the offending metal, there is
plenty. I took a 4-1/2 in grinder home with me from work, re-mounted the
caliper and ground the areas of the caliper that showed paint transfer until
the wheel no longer rubbed. I was quite relieved when I finished, I had
feared that I would suddenly find fluid flowing out where it had not flowed
before. That was enough for Monday, I didn't want to tear into the driver's
side with only a couple of hours daylight. I knew that I was going to have
problems on that side. Rolled Rosie into the garage and went in to wash up.
