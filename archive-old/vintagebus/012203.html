&gt;         Can anyone confirm the interchangability between the cooling fan of
&gt; a doghouse shroud vs a standard upright?  I have a pile of standard shrouds

&gt; me that the old uprght fans were wider.

The fan that goes with the doghouse cooler is wider; you can probably
use the small fan in the big housing, but it's probably sub-optimal.
