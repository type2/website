Subject: Carb Query + Spurious Leak Question

I have a German Solex 30 PICT-2 in a box of part without the auto-choke
thingy, and I have a Brazilian H30/31 PICT on my 1600 sp in the bus.  What's
the difference, should I fix the German one and install it...keep the
Brazilian as a spare?

The PO of my '67 Kombi stopped by yesterday to see how things were going,
and when I told him that I was going to rebuild the engine that he put
together without case sealant in order to put in some case sealant and fix
the fact that the distributor is in backwards (he sez &quot;the gears just 180
deg. out....no problem&quot;, which makes me nervous,  he said that it is not
good to split the case because it might warp when I release the tension
that's holding it together.

Sorry about the run on sentence from hell..

What's the deal?  Shouldn't I be able to take my engine apart and put it
back together without warpage?  Is this a problem?  But if I don't, do you
think that there is any chance that if I run the engine without case
sealant, and ignore the leak, that it will just &quot;go away&quot;?  I thought not.
Please advise...!

Thanks, Gene
