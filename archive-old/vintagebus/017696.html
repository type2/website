Subject: Re: [VB] Round Mirrors: Best brand?

my single cab had an elephant when i got it.  it was a pretty decent condition &quot;vw of a&quot; mirror too but i wanted a round mirror cuz that was what it had originally.  at octo this year i bought a mirror from the vintage parts booth.  (i guess i made quite an impression on the owner cuz he remembered me from last year when i told him that my friend said i could drive his '55 cabrio around and could i have the keys please?)  the mirror seems a real nice quality.  there was a bit of an adjustment to having a smaller view but i got used to it quickly enough.  the elephant was fogged anyway and the round mirror, though smaller was clearer.  these few months that i've been using the round mirror it has performed well.  that might sound strange but the new mirror on my sunroof is not performing well.  jp gave me a tip that i will use on my truck's mirror if i ever need and will be using on the sunroof's mirror.  he said to put a drop of locktight on the round dealie (nice technical term) at the back of the mirror and that will be enough to keep it from moving around while driving.
