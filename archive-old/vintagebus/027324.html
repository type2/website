Subject: Sighting

Rented The Haunting.  At the very end is a Blue/WHite splitty with what
looks like submarine hatch top.   A Kombi I believe (doesn't have the
windows over the vents).  Bumpers didn't have overriders either.  That
may not be authentic but the movie makers seemed to care about the
&quot;authenticity&quot; of the vehicles in the movie - there was a yellow Gremlin
with he right brake light out, just like the one I used to own...

be digging in my business.  You don't even know my dog's name.
