Subject: rusted intake manifold
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

It had been really hot.   in the nineties last couple days, and this is real 
NW 70 % humidity hot, not that 17%  humidity SW heat. 

In spite of this, I have been tweaking with the VW s.   Forget why but I 
ended up sitting on a milk crate behind the barndoor with a crewdriver in my 
hand.  For some reason I poked the intake manifold, oh to knock a piece of 
crud loose, and the screwdriver went through the heat riser tube.  How'd that 
happen?

So I proceeded to find a 36hp manifold, and start cleaning out the heat 
riser.  Got it clear through with the clutch wire on a drill, but there is 
still crud in there, so it is upside down with solvent soaking in it 
overnight.  Hope that will help it soften up.  At least there is lots of room 
in there, and I hope I have a spare pair of 36hp intake donuts.
