Hi List,
Since it's Friday I thought I would share a story with
yall that everyone can probably relate to. 
Last week my wife, daughter, and I took a little road
trip up through the mountains of NW Arkansas. I'm
talkin way off the beaten path in our 63 crew cab,
dirt mountain roads and all. It was really beautiful.
As you can imagine, there are no road signs &quot;deep in
the bush&quot; so we were traveling by topography maps and
compass. My navigator let us miss a turn and we ended
up even further in the back woods. (Kinda like the
movie Deliverence!) Anywho, we came upon an old
hunting shack. Across the road in a gully where it
appeared it also served as someones trash dump, there
was an early 50's 21 window delux with slidin rag top
just sittin there rustin away. It was full of bullet
holes. You could not put you hand over one area that
was not shot all to hell. It almost brought a tear to
our eyes to see such a sight! I wish I could save the
bus, but it's too far gone. Rust and bullet holes have
taken their toll. I took some pics with a non-digital
camera we had, do when we get the pics developed, I'll
post them for all to see.
Hope it was alright to share this on the list.
Have a great weekend everone!!!

3DPete
