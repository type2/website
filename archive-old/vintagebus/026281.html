&gt; You'd probably be better off taking one of these rust free lagwagens
&gt; out of California.

Right!  They're clogging up the roads down here.  While yanking my 67 Westy
back from ID, I had a guy holler at me while going south on the 5 near
Redding.  &quot;You want another one of those?&quot;.   &quot;Of course&quot; I yelled back.
Unfortunately, turned out to be a lagwagen with no tranny.  It would have been
free though!

Come to Cali....just leave the splits please ;-) !

Steve
