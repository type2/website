Referring to going down long hills and over-revving.....  I feel somehow
that when I am cruising down a long hill, even though I am traveling no
faster than I would on a straight and level road, I am inflicting wear on
the drivetrain.  Does the reverse compression braking practice (again...I am
merely going 50-55 in 4th) cause undo strain?  I tend to lay off the
brakes....I see the over-use of brakes as a sign of weakness, or
something.....should I use more brake to fend off damage to that which makes
my bus go?
