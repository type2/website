I 2nd Thom's suggestion of the Bentley manual, the reprint of VWs Transporter 
Workshop Manual 1963.  It has sections that show how all the folds of the 
metal go together etc.   You say 58-62 (64?) panel, there are differences, 
and whether you are doing a stock resto or not makes more differences.  It 
was written for 63-67 buses, but it quite good for the tunnel case 
tranny/post 36hp buses before that (mid 59 through 62)  Yes has reduction 
gears in detail.   Written for the dealer when these were new vehicles.   Of 
course, if you want to do a nice job, panels are really tricky, as you can't 
hide the welds under the interior panels, so there they are, finish work 
inside and out.

Of course, keep looking at the list.  When wetake time away from writing 
about Pucks and whether or not it is a sin to radically customise a splitty, 
we do talk about our buses, and there are lots of people with websites 
showing their labourious fixing up of some old bus.

&lt;&lt; Sounds like you need a bentley manual, and to spend some time looking
 at my site and some of the work I've done.  The outer body work is going
 to be pretty much the same whether it's a panel or a deluxe.

and

 &gt; paint, but I plan on doing the welding and mechanical work my self. Panels
 &gt; don't have much interior to deal with, so I am not concerned with that. The
 &gt; books I have bought so far. Seem to have excluded type 2 info, focusing on
 &gt; type 1 and type 3 VWs instead. Getting to the point, I need a book that
 &gt; shows me details of body panels and gives me a breakdown on all mechanicals
 &gt; including the mysterious reduction boxes.
