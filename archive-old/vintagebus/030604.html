&gt; Why do these have to be RASCHE?  Any good h/w store will have the correct
&gt;
&gt; size metric bolt.
&gt;
&gt; I have two NOS ones that say &quot;KAMAX&quot;. Talk about A.R.!!!!!
&gt;

Because of Greg and Robert's obsession with &quot;DORN&quot; and &quot;RASCHE&quot; bolts I had my
daughter go through my bolt boxes yesterday while she was at my shop. I asked her
to pull out *anything* that said &quot;DORN&quot;, &quot;RASCHE&quot;, &quot;KAMAX&quot;, etc...

Needless to say I know have a box full of these bolts for you guys. Send me your
lists and I'll see what I can do for you.......

Greg
