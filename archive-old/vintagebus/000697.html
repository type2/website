Hi Tom,
Sounds like missing/worn shift rod bushings, and/or loose coupler bolt/s.  
The latter is what caused us lots of problems with our truck for a while.  
Turned out that one of the bolts had loosened slightly due to the safety wire 
not being tied in such a way to keep pressure on it to keep it from 
loosening.  Resulting in a slighty loosened bolt, and a coupler with a ovaled 
threaded hole!  Eric&amp;Barb
