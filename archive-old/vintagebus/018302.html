Pretty weak joke. Athough your knowledge of the metals
market is impressive. Actually, it could have been
saved with a simple implication of the actual use of
platinum in the interior, based on what I hear those
TMI sets cost.

I heard that the Wolfsburg West sets were actually the
TMI panels, just heard it in conversation from someone
at a show, not verified.

So mesh gerey is what, Pwewter? Lead? Carbon? How much
an ounce? (heh)

&gt; 
&gt; Well, at a current price of roughly $600 per ounce
&gt; for platinum, of
&gt; course they're going to be expensive.  Maybe you
&gt; should consider going
&gt; with something a bit cheaper, like gold ($264/oz) or
&gt; silver
&gt; ($4.70/oz).  Or if you *do* decide for that
&gt; 100-point resto, go for
&gt; rhodium ($1700).  I have trouble believing that
&gt; sitting on metal mesh
&gt; of any type is going to be all that comfortable
&gt; during either
&gt; temperature extreme, though.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, you were talking about colour, not material. 
&gt; Never mind.
