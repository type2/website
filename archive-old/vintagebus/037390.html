&lt;&lt; Turns out my 28 PCI leaks at both end of the throttle shaft, more so on 
the right than on the left.  Looks like it's time to track down new

tomorrow.... &gt;&gt;
Hi Dworkin,
Your carb maybe worn out too much at the throttle shaft, but it sounds more 
like you have other problems causing the fuel leak/s out of this area.  Even 
worn out carbs should not leak fuel out there due to the engine sucking in 
air and when the engine is not running the shut off valve should be doing 
it's job.  Best to check your fuel pump rod for proper hieght to thusly cause 
not too high or low of pressure!  Too high of pressure will actually push 
down/open the resevoir valve and float.  Next if that did not do the trick 
replace your resevoir shut off valve.  Lastly if those have not done it try 
replacing your float in the carb.  We had the same leaking problem after 
shutting down the engine around the throttle butterfly shaft.  Turned out the 
otherwise perfect looking float was too heavy and we never had a problem with 
since then!   Eric&amp;Barb
