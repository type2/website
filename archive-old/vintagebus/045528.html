Hi all,



  Well I tried to install that cool new shifter I got into my 58 and I have

run into a problem.  The ball on the end of the shifter is a larger

diameter than the socket on the end of my shift tube.  Did the change sizes

along the way somewhere?  Is this why aftermarket shifters are always

advertised for 62-67?  And if so is the end of the shift tube

interchangeable.  If so I have access to a 63 that does not contain many

more parts than the shift tube and will remove it if necesary.  Really want

to use this shifter if at all possible.  Thanks all Happy Friday.

the shift linkage changed, yes.    I don't know if parts are interchangable.
my parts list list 

211 711 155  rod gearshift front to ch # 501 706
214 711 155              &quot; &quot; &quot;                         from 501 707 to # 835
087
211 711 155 B         &quot; &quot; &quot;                                    835 088 to #
216 028 111
211 711 155 C        &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;             from 216 028 112  on (book pub in 67)

meaning it changed sometime in 59, then again in 61 and then early in the 66
model year

the stick itself changed at ch # 501 707, then again at the early 66 change.

  Be aware that the bolts like to break off when undoingthe linkage- I advise
heat to break rust loose, alternated with squirts of water from a bicycle
bottle (I know, not nice when it's above you and you are under the bus) and
greasing everything when reassembling it.      (later splits have the shift
stick further forward, your 58 would have it close to the seat base).  What is
cool about the shift you want to put on it?    Is there someting wrong with
your shifting?
