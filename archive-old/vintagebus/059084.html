Subject: redux/trans repair

Once the snap rings, thrust washers and axle shafts are removed from
the trans, shouldn't the differential side gears just slide out? I
can't see anything holding them in, but I am a little reluctant to
take a puller to them without a second opinion.
The holes in one redux box into which the bolts holding the spring
plate on thread are tapped oversize. I'd like to fix this, would some
kind of case-saver like threaded insert do the job, or should I be
looking at having the holes welded up and retapped? Can anyone tell me
the dos and don'ts of welding on cast parts like the redux boxes?
I'd like to pull the end caps out of the redux boxes and get a better
look at the reduction gear shafts and bearings. Am I going to able to
find new end caps, or will I be most likely reusing the ones I have?
Is welding on a nut and fashioning a puller the simplest way to remove
them?
Thanks,
Joel and the '64 Sundial
