&lt;&lt;  I have a generator fuel pump that seems to be sealed, no way to open it.  
I have suddenly developed fuel delivery problems.  No fuel for a while and 
then fuel again later.  I have an in-line filter so I can see what is going 
on.  Is there any way to open this pump up and clean it out? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
No there is no way to open those up and reseal it safely.  If the engine is 
running with no problem then the bubbles are just fuel expanding into a 
vapor.  Get one that you can open up as a spare/replacement.   Eric&amp;Barb
