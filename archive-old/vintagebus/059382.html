&gt; I've heard also that shims are to blame for this.  What's the opinion here
&gt; on the number you should use?  I've heard at least 8, with some combination
&gt; of this inside and outside the pulley but at least 8 all together.

Hi Charles,
At least 8 for stock engines and a few more will not hurt.  For us with a 2:1 
ratio crankshaft pulley and the earlier non-doghouse stock shorter fan belt 
we have to use 15 shims.
