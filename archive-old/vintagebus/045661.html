carpet... it is 7/8 thick and very cheap... ($30 or so for a 6x14 foot

Hi Steve,
Been there, now dealing with the resulting rust in two buses now due to DPO 
foam installations.  Best to use stuff that does not soak up moisture like a 
sponge!  We have been thinking of using a type of styrofoam that you can get 
in 4x8' sheets from your local hardware store.  Even with this type of 
styrofoam we are planning to thinly coat the roof and walls with roofing tar 
to prevent any moisture that might get trapped behind these panels from 
rusting the roof and/or walls.  We have a 1959 VW Technical Bulletin showing 
how to install panels of styrofoam and interior panels over it!   Eric&amp;Barb
