Subject: Re: [VB] Need help in calculating speed vs rpm

&gt; I am getting closer to get my '60 DD on the road and would like some help in calculating RPMs vs. Speed.  I
plan to use the tranny and reduction
 boxes from a '66 and still keep the 15&quot; wheels.  What can I expect with
 that set up.  I have reseatrched the FF but I don't want speed just pulling
 power.  I will have a 1904cc.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.


Having 15&quot; wheels does not mean or change a thing. The only thing you you have to worry about is the outside
diameter of the tire you put on. Go here and plug in some tire sizes:

A while back, this was posted to the type2 library:

Modern Tire Sizes for Split-Window Buses with 14&quot; and 15&quot; Wheels
by Kabayo, cabayao_at_earthlink_dot_net

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've posted this many times. This is the results of my tire size research:

European sized metric tires, such as a 185SR14 for example, do not have an 80% aspect ratio, but 82% or 83% (I
forget which, but I think it's 82%). This changes things just a bit. I've added the Euro spec tires to the
list of acceptable 14&quot; and 15&quot; sizes for buses.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bentley says that the 3/4 ton (small nut) models came with a 6.40-15 tire, having a diameter of 27.16&quot;, +/-
.24&quot;.

This makes the nearest European radial tire size a 185R15, and the nearest P-Metric size a 205/75-15.

How about running 14&quot; wheels on a 3/4 ton (small nut) bus?

Good luck getting most of these on the back. I've gotten some big tires on the back of an old bus by letting
the air out while wedging the tire between the drum and the body lip, and then refilling it after getting the
wheel bolted up.

One ton (big nut) models came with 7.00-14 tires, having a diameter of 26.22&quot;, +/- .24&quot;.

This makes the nearest radial tire size a 195R14, and the nearest commonly available P-Metric a 205/75-14.
