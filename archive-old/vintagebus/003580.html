&gt; In fact, VW would just
&gt; as soon lose that part of their history that reminds potential customers
&gt; of underpowered, poorly heated, noisy vehicles driven by hippies

This is exactly VW's problem. They tried for years to ignore the enormous
success of the Beetle. Those were years plagued with consistently low sales.
Only after they brought the &quot;new&quot; beetle out did they finally see a
noticeable increase in sales. I think this is why they are hinting at a
&quot;new&quot; bus. Maybe we'll even see a &quot;new&quot; T3 and Ghia!
