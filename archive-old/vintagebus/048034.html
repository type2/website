I have an unrestored '65 deluxe hardtop that I will keep stock. I also have a 
'66 deluxe hardtop that I am  converting into a custom camper. I believe 
there is room for everyone on the list. The problem comes with expressing 
your opinion without pissing any one off. Actually, It is quite fun to read 
how excited some of my fellow VW enthusiasts become when something absurd is 
posted. Do you think that could be the reason he wrote it? Janet
