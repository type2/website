&gt;
&gt;So how do I tell if my bus is a 3/4 or a 1 ton chassis? I have bus
&gt;1145666. VW built a panel,  Sundial (I believe)made it a camper. It
&gt;was built, sold and first registered in 1963, but uses 1964 brake
&gt;parts. The RGB spindles take 46mm nuts. The rims are 15&quot;, and I think
&gt;they are probably original, since most everything else is.

It looks like your Bus was built right after all Transporters got
the big (46mm) nuts, regardless of 3/4 or 1 ton rating.  Like,
the same or next day:

  5 Aug 1963     1 144 303   Big-nut for all Transporters (Bentley)
  5 Aug 1963     1 145 427   14&quot; tubeless tires for 1-ton models (Doliwa)
                (1 145 666   your Bus)

If you don't have M215 then you probably have a 3/4 ton.
 
&gt;What is the difference in construction between the two chassis?

I *think* the only differences are in the running gear, particularly
the reduction boxes and rear brake drums.  I don't think there is
anything special about the chassis, like extra frame rails etc, but
I could be wrong about that.
