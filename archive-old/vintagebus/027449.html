Subject: re:Tent repop

I think something with few poles and no holes in the bus would be the
ideal. Maybe get fiberglass poles or something light. Maybe some sort of
padded rain gutter clamp or magnets to hold the tent to the bus. If you
can get the new tents with floors for $300 to $500 I guess the camping
tent would be hard to compete with. Something with the simplicity of the
sun shade that slips in the doors (I think form West Coast Classics) but
with room for 4 or 5 chairs worth of shade (or dryness since I am in the
NW) would probably be a hot seller.
Just my input,
