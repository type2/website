Subject: Re: [VB] spare tire size?/electric tire pump


Couldnt you take the front tire and put it on the
rear, and then put the spare on the front?

&gt;  Hi Chris,
&gt;  For our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion we
&gt; use a 165SR15 tire for a 
&gt;  spare to get us to the next availible tire repair
&gt; shop.  Since we are using 
&gt;  205/75R15 on this bus the spare is a smaller
&gt; diameter.  This means if we 
&gt; have 
&gt;  to use the spare on the rear this could ruin the
&gt; differential if run for 
&gt;  several thousand miles due to the differant
&gt; circumferances.
&gt;    You also could try just deflating the larger size
&gt; tire to the point it 
&gt;  might squeeze into the rear spare postion and carry
&gt; a tire pump (foot or 
&gt;  electric) to fill it when you need it.

&gt; I recommend carrying an electric pump.   I bought
&gt; one for $25 at the local 
&gt; schmuck's FLAPS, and it is great.  It is made to use
&gt; with the cigarette 
&gt; lighter, but I have an adaptor that means I can clip
&gt; it to the battery 
&gt; directly.  I can fill up tires on the buses and
&gt; bicycles and all kinds of 
&gt; time saving stuff.  It lives behind the front seat,
&gt; easy access on road trips.
