Subject: oil pressure relief valve

I want to make sure that my oil pressure relief valves (dual presure AE 
case) are working correctly:
    how do I do it?
    how can I know what spring lengths (and valves) are correct for an 
unknown engine 1600DP AE case?
    I assume that the solid part faces upward on the valve?
    
I still got the oil temp blues... bus is still running 230-250F 
(estimated using berg dipstick) on the highway and once oil temps are up 
they never really go down even when pulling off the highway and gentle 
driving
