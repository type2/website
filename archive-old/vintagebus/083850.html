&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; What is the droaning moaning noise heard when driving at 65-70 (3500-4000+
&gt; rpm)? Is there a resonance in the engine? I have had this noise on 3 engines
&gt; so far. The current one has a counterbalanced crank.
&gt; Anyone know?

It's a rumble of discontent amongst the squirrels.  You're working them
too hard.

&gt; I know that Bernie Bergman sells a steel pulley and claims it damps out
&gt; something.

It _might_ damp out torsional vibrations in the crank.  OTOH,
it might actually increase it, depending upon the crank, flywheel, and
pulley combination.  I wouldn't go there unless you have the capability of
doing torsional testing on the whole assembly.
