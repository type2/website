Hi Christopher,
This is a great way to kill yourself and your bus.  Never heat till red hot
and/or quench with water suspension parts that steer or hold up the bus.
Doing this either softens the threaded fastener and the part will stretch like
taffy.  Or even when you quench it which hardens ferrous objects you may not
rehardened the part enough or just as worse you overhardened the part and it
will possibly shatter under stress.  Do yourself a big favor and scrap the
lugbolts you subjected to this heating and get some others to replace them!
