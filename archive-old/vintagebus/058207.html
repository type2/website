Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Jalosy vs. EZ windows was Kill copyright/web-geek thread?

The other day while browsing thru Home Depot, I came across a whole rack of window cranks.  
Ask for 'casement window' cranks, I have the exact same windows in my EZ and there are 2 windows that the cranks have been replaced.  They should have something that would work.

&gt; Check out some local RV shops. Alot of those parts are still available. I've 
&gt; seen those types of windows on many a pull-behind camper. Just tons of 
&gt; different sizes. But the regulators (cranks) should be much the same.

&gt; &gt; What I am hoping to find out is: 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. Should I fix all the operators of this set of windows? Or should I 
&gt; &gt; trade them or buy a set of functional jalosy louvered type windows to use 
&gt; &gt; in their place? Are the windows that I have rare? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. Does anyone know where I can get the hardware to fix these windows? I way to share and print your photos:
