Thanks for the info Thom.  I will probably buy one for my 69 (too many little skinny wire connectors) once I get the 63, 56, and 54 done.

Thanks for posting the wiring diagrams on your page.  Very helpful.  I have many of them in my old manuals, but it is nice to have that many of them there to compare on the computer... And, when my hands are all greasy and dirty I would rather come look them up on the computer than get my vintage books all grubby.  They still make keyboards :O

Thanks again,
Richard (now I just need a computer hookup in the garage for easy wiring diagram viewing) K.
