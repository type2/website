Hey all!

    Friday I replaced my #3 &amp; #4 pistons and lo and behold they were Mahle 
88's with EMPI stamped on them.  The cylinders also had the EMPI logo on 
them.  Roller crank as well.  Being more of a stock/purist, I was curious if 
anyone knows any history on these types of pistons and cylinders.  The motor 
resides in my '58 Porsche 356 coupe for now.  That is until I finish 
rebuilding a 356 SC motor within the next month or so.  Then it will replace 
the 1200cc I have in my '56 single cab(bus content).  Any EMPI fans out 
there on the vintage bus list?

Drive Em!
