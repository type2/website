Subject: Re: [VB] Towing with a Freeway Flyer

If you have a truck or a light bus, and live on the flat, FF works

In my westy the FF is not so hot.   It makes the motor seems wimpy. it's been 
there for 3 years though.    I don't have the oomph to go fast.   I did get 
slightly smaller tires  (195 rather than 205s) when I got new ones, and that 
helped a little.    Haven't towed with this bus though.

I'd go with the 4.12 if I were you.

I had towed with my 61 several times.  Towed a bug  500 miles once.  My then 
bf really wanted an oval, and that's where it was.  To find one with little 
rust.  And the 61 pulled it, it wasn't so much teh weight, but being careful 
with the braking and turning.  We did take it over the cascades though.

 Anyone towing stuff with their FFs and non-monster motors?  Boats, 
utilities, Pucks, whatevah?  I'd be towing to campsites and boat ramps within 
 about 100 miles of here, max.
 
 Man, I'm getting the vibe that I need to use a stock ratio and get happier 
with going slower.  Fortunately I don't *have* to use the Interstate.
