I have a large stock of both kinds of couplers, early sandwich type (comes
with grub screws) and the latter pressed couplers (doesn't come with
screws). The later style ones are OEM VW manufactured and not the ruff cast
copies out there. When shopping for a coupler look at how the castings are.
If the castings are ruff and the VW numbers are barely readable avoid it.
The good ones are beautiful castings with very distinct numbers cast in.

Hey, I have had that happen myself.   Then I was stuck in 3rd gear. which 
actually was doable to get to the parts store.  Anyway, there are two kinds 
appropriate foir the VW splitty bus.   The older kinid is the &quot;sandwich&quot; 
kind, the end and metal plates are 'filled' with maybe half an inch of 
rubber.  These are harder to find new, but are appropriate for buses that 
came with split case trannys (may 19 59 and earlier)

THe later kinid have more metal around them, So when the coupler uncouples, 
the metall will still hold the pieces loosely together.   These are actually

available new with VW OOOO stampings on the- better quality - from a variety

of sources.   

If you use the later kinid on a split case tranny bus (DC?) it transmits a 
bunch of tranny noise through the shift stick.   Which sucks.  The tunnel 
case tranny buses are mounted differently, so you can use the metal covered 
coupler w/o noise.

there are also urethane ones, aftermarket.

I recommend investing in a 8mm square headed socket if you feel like you
will 
ever mess with shift couplers again.  Snap-on makes them.

 I was at a stop light this afternoon on the way to my daughter's swim meet 
when
 disaster struck.  I put the DC in gear and the linkage came loose.
Figuring 
that
 it had popped out, I got the truck pushed over to the side, rolled out my
 &quot;emergency repair mat&quot;, slid under the DC and found that the rear shift 
coupler
 had exploded into two pieces.  Everything was still there, but wire would 
not hold
 it together to allow shifting.  I cut the wire off and aligned everything
and
 tried to figure out what I could do to make it operational.  I hit on the 
idea of
 using some of the zip ties in the tool box.

 Question:  The coupler that was down there was red urethane.  Why aren't 
they made
 out of metal?  Does that much vibration get absorbed by the non-metal 
couplers?
 
 Looks like I'll be out coupler shopping in the morning.
