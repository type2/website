Subject: 67 bus update

Just a quick note to say that with the help of 5 people (4 pulling on the
seal and 1 inside pushing on the window), we removed the front windows out
of the 66 bus (seals intact!!!).  In an hour, I had them installed in the
67.  First observation upon removal from the 66 was the massive amount of
water that was just sitting on my POR15'd window frames.  Not good.  This
pretty much confirms that you should really use some tar or sealant under
the seal to keep the water out - I'm going to for sure.

Also, a nice old guy stopped by tonight and gave me a trailer hitch for a
squareback he used to own and a rim and tire off of it.  The hitch may be
able to be modified to work on the bus but I'm not sure yet.  Then an
aquaintance of mine told me about a 4 door beetle at a junkyard in Missouri.
We're gonna go check it out tomorrow evening with the camera in tow.  I'll
have pix available online once they are developed.

All fer now...
