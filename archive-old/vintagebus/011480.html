	twas written-

&gt;&gt;&quot;Everywhere Ed&quot; made it back to NM in the Barnhaufwagen.  He was
supposed to weigh at a scale when the got there, but no official word yet
We estimated his gross weight when he left St Louis to be well over 5000
lbs!!  Think about that when you're debating whether or not your bus can
handle a simple commute....&lt;&lt;

Ed stopped by my house the other day and reported an official weight of
just over 4800 pounds if I'm not mistaken.  He's a bus driving hero,
though he does things to buses that scare me. 

 This debate about commuting is pointless- the bus will go as long and as
far as it capable of, relative to what YOU have done to enable it.  My 59
single cab went 5000 miles with a blown main seal, pushing out a quart of
oil per gas tamk.  Not the best thing to be sure, but I keep up with it,
and I'll fix the damn bus when I have the time and space....

FWIW- 35 miles is a good commute for a bike, nothing for a bus...
