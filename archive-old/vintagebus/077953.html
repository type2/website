Subject: No more begging - or whining - or complaining ..

No problem Woody, I won't bother you with my tiresome problems any more.
Excuse me for having so many problems...   but did it ever occur to you that
maybe the majority of male mechanics are _at_$$#%\&quot;$ .. and have no conscience
regarding ripping of the uneducated ..   I'll unsubscribe and go bother the
NG for a while .. I mean, if that's ok with you ...

Diane

While I can only speak for myself, I wonder if anyone else is getting as
sick as I am hearing about the endless trials and tribulations of Dianne.
