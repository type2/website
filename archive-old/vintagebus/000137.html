Subject: [VB] 59' Engine Lid
Message-ID: &lt;0.3973c2e4.25465c13_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Sorry for always putting requests for parts up, but im almost so succesful on 
the list! (this is  my final neccesity item   aka  not an accessory  to keep 
the '59 panel resto in motion to complete by the year 2000)

I need a nice, correct engine lid for the old '59!
Help!

-it's true when people say that you should double your time expected to take
and triple your expected costs !
