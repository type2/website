Subject: Re: [VB] Oil leak at Oil Pump cover

Hi Ray,

This pump is a VW heavy duty pump made by Empi with a cover that has a screw
on filter attachment. There is a single circular slot in the pump body that
faces the pump cover. I put an O-ring that came with the pump of equal size
into this slot then bolted the cover on. I think maybe I should have also
included a thin paper gasket, hence the source of the leak.

Are you saying that the O-ring should not have been used here? These engines
are so cool. If they aren't put together right, they will usually let you
know.

Dave

&gt; OK, now you got me confused. Skinny little &quot;O&quot; ring. Are we talking
&gt; about a Vanagan or a Subaru ? That little groove around the surface of
&gt; the oil pump with the two little slots in it is the designed oil pump
&gt; priming channel. The only thing that should be on the face of your oil
&gt; pump under the cover is the really thing oil pump cover gasket.

&gt;  An oil leak developed at the oil pump cover. I pulled it and the skinny
&gt; little O-ring was out of its groove and smashed. I will need to replace
&gt; it tomorrow.
