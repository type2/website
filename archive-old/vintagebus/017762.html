Regarding the wheel well scraping, a friend of mine had an 
epsiode where the bus hit a dip _at_ freeway speeds, and one of the front
wheels hit the top of the wheel well and locked momentarily,
pitching the bus.  He swore off lowered buses after that.

I get a kick out of watching all of the local kids with their
slammed buses and bugs, bobbling down the road.  That can't
be comfy - I know the lowered cars I had weren't and they were not
that low!

What makes it even more funny is knowing they spent several hundred
dollars on lowering goodies, and then low-profile tires, and a killer stereo,
on a bus they've rattle-canned in gray primer from top to bottom.  Rarely 
do the cars progress beyond this stage.  What they've spent on 
back-of-the-magazine-cool stuff would have bought them a 
low-end paint job.  I know of one cal-look bug that's been in primer
going on 10 years.

Ah, youth.
