Subject: re:Trex for slats

I recently read about an architect who wanted to use this stuff(or something
just like it) as a shading device for a building he was either renovation or
designing from scratch. anyway he wanted the stuff in I think 2x2 or 1x2
dimension, the comp,any that manufactured it would not let him do it, even
if he gave up the so called warranty, because he was using it for a
differnet use thatn originally intended. he ended up buying the stuff &quot;for
another project&quot; milling it himslef at another location, and then using it.
eventually it was published in a architectural magazine-i think
architectural record.

pretty cool looking.
