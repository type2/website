&gt; procedure for installing these? do they need to be welded on or do you
just
&gt; kind of fit them on there? in case it matters, i got them from RMMW and
they
&gt; are the universal bug/bus kind in chrome. Thanks!

You remove the vent window from the vehicle and remove the glass and seal.
You drill or grind out the soft rivets holding the original latches in and
then replace. This is a little more interesting with the repros you got,
because they are a little too wide to fit in the bus channel. I have
successfully pressed them in with the bench vise and got them riveted down,
I also broke one once. I have also ground them down a little narrower to
fit, but be careful not to get them to be a loose fit or they will eat the
soft rivets and come loose. I like them tight and pressed in the best, YMMV.
Then, replace the glass and seal and reinstall. If'n you are putting in a
new seal, that is a whole 'nuther project in itself. If you can reuse the
old one, piece of cake.
