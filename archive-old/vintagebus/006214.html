Too much work. I'm just going to leave them be. I gotta get this here one
put together and then I don't have to have anymore in the yard. It ain't the
shape of them, it ain't the lack of reductions gears, it isn't even the lack
of a proper windshield. It is that plastic dash. I just can't tolerate a
plastic dash. Yuck. Other than that, I wouldn't mind them at all.
