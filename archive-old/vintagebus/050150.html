Subject: Most Equatorial Listee?

Who's closest to the middle?

I have a vacation home in the Philippines, where I keep a '68 Beetle 1200.
I am hoping to buy a nice bus there eventually, but they're not common
anymore.  I looked at a '67 21 window when I was there in February, but it
was just a shell, no interior, most glass missing.  I'm hoping to find a
more complete example.  I do know a guy with an ambulance, but it's been
converted to a Combi.  The only way you can tell it was an ambulance is by
the fan, and the home-made hinges on top of the hatch.

Anyway, it's just a few hundred miles north of the equator.  Though I'm
only there 3 weeks a year ('til I retire in 2003), the VW is there full
time!  Do I qualify?
