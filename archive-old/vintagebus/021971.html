well my 65 westy is back on the road (watch out!)   as last week.   The tranny
was swapped out- took that opportunity to clean and paint the spring plates,
spring paint covers, various engine tin, rear brake backing plates, axles
tubes, and maybe something else too (semi gloss black was the colour of
choice).  

Cleaning off backing plates is a thankless job with a wire brush and
sandpaper.   Need to get a sandblaster thingy  &amp; a box set up to do that
stuff.

With the engine out, the fan housing was replaced with one in better shape,
various grommets renewed, the completely missing thermosat assembly installed
(with thanks to Chris who found me the NOS vertical rod, Tim who found me the
horizontal doghouse only rod, and Eric, who filled in the missing gap with the
connectors bits between the flaps and the horizontal rod)   There are much
pieces to that set-up.  It'll probably help it run WARMER in this weather
(highs of 50, lows of 40) as the engine tends to run very cool in the winter.
After driving half an hour, the thermostat had not opened.   (worry?)  However
I had tested the thermostat itself by dropping it into boiling water, and it
dutifully opened, closing after removal from pot and a short time to cool.  So
the activating temp had just not been reached.       It makes sense, doesn't
it?  Though I never thought of it that way before.    The optimal engine temp
does not mean as cold as possible.   :)

Letsee, the endplay was reset (a little loose), new main seal installed.
Installed a preheat metal tube (bolts onto a head to muffler bolt) and the
matching under-tin.  The tube draws the heated air from right next to the
head, and goes up just through the rear tin, where the flexy preheat tube
sconnects to it.   The under tin has a hole in it, that the tube goes through.
Very cool, I think.   Though I think This one is from a 67 bug, not correct
for a 65 bus, which takes a different form of the same concept.

New spring plate bushings, and cleaned up the original paint on the mounting
area, carefully replaced all at the marks I made.  It looks nice with the
shiny black against the shiny velevet green.    :)

New rear shift bushing (middle and front had been changed before)

Found that contrary to popular opinion, there can be a right and left on the
axle shafts.    One side had been rebuild (RGBox) and the axle machined ?  for
a slightly smaller ID new bearing?   In any case, it had to go back to way it
wanted, wasting hours.

And of course, the tricky non split tranny boots.



Tranny in, engine in,   the center section (rebuildt by Todd w/ a 3.875 R&amp;P)
didn't shift well into 1st or 2nd at first, however this is normal I am told
for shifting to be difficult at first with a rebuildt unit, and it wore
together in about 25miles, by which time the shifting was light.   

Flushed &amp; bled brakes.

Changed the gear oil yesterday (at about 150 miles), and it was, of course,
full of shavings, but no chunks.   

There is a wierd noise in the back, though, noticable when I take it out of
gear and let it idle while moving.  Don't know if it makes it elsewise, or if
the engine/tranny noises just mask it  Eric (veewee111) thinks it is not to
worry about...  just a rear axle/reduction gear noise, but I would rather it
not be there.    It does not make a difference if I step on the brake or not.
But I have to identify the exact cause to make it go away.   Reduction gear
parts are expensive, and they are the boxes I had when I got the bus (quiet).
The fulcrum plates had been changed, to have less play, and I wonder if that
is the cause.   If I have to strip those axles off again I will.      I jacked
up the back of the bus, and checked for play, and spun the wheels, and there
was a sound of redcuction gears, but I would expect that.  Hmmmmm.............
Redajusted the rear brakes as long as it was in the air (good to redo not long
after installing the shoes)

Put some air in the tires, checked the lug bolts to make sure they hadn't
loosened.

The interior I had stripped out earlier, and didn't feel like hanging the new
roof panels, especially as the front one I hadn't finished.  Got more of that
shiny bubbled wrap insuation, and stuck more in the walls, and installed the
new long panels, the panel in the cabinet by the bed, and the panel on the
drivers side by the bed.     I was anal to use the correct screws (smaller
head than the normal panelling screws).     I had to sand a tad off the side
of the long panel for it to hang right.  I polished the metal trim  for the
panel on the pass side by the bed.   Fitting the panel in the clset, which
must bend, is tricky.  i wet down the bendy part and heated it by my garage
heater.   Put in the headbanger cabinet, the closet, the little corner cabinet
and the bed.   Next step is the table and the bits by the bulkhead.      I
think I did a fine job on the birch veneer, but will look for a local supply
for the long panel with the grain going the other way, like somene said they
found somewhere.      Mine is spliced together, and a small seam shows.
good, though.

Later when the pass side rocker gets repaired, I will pull it all out again,
then install the new roof panels, and the new floor and linoleum.  probably
sandblast and repaint the floor, too.

It looks much better, the old panels were house painted brown.  :(  U&gt;G&gt;L&gt;Y

Tried that rheostat thing for the wiper Stephen mentioned, but it just worked
like a switch for me.   :(   Guess I'll pop in another voltage drop.

Had wires melt- to the ignition- at the connector it was fraying and heated up
because of part of the wire being broken and it melted.  Cobbled it together
for the time being.   The wiring tuneup is scheduled for next week.

Eric shamed me into rejetting the carberettor.  We'll see if the milage goes
up.

Put a new circlip on the right wiper shaft- keeps it from moving up and down
the threaded tube and clunking and wearing (the old one came loose, didn't
clip it anymore)

Engine leaks a bit.    I'll replace some of those door seals too.  It's pretty
warm in that bus, though, but it does leak around the cargo doors a bit.

Added air to the tires a couple days ago, but now the RF is almost flat (!!)
to the tire store I willl go- probably it stepped on a nail or something.

Ps if anyone has ideas on that rear thunky noise please say so.
