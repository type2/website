&gt; aviation sealer works well for oil pumps,   all you guys can use what the

&gt; sealant never cures and will not clog oil passages  it, and makes it so when
&gt; you or the next guy takes it apart,  it comes apart without a big hammer.

I note that the new Mexican engine come sealed with Hylomar.  No leaks so
far.  Hylomar is also non-hardening so things come apart easily.
