List:

Anyone out the who is in or very close to Lancaster, PA?  I need someone to pick up some glass for me and ship it to me as the seller won't ship glass.  Of course I will compensate you for you time and expense.

TIA.  BTW, it's only one peice of glass so it shouldn't be TOO big of a hassle.

Robert
