&gt;Do I mask off the bottom, paint the top and then reverse?

I've found it's easier to paint the bottom first, as it's easier to mask
off the bottom than the top.  When I masked off the bottom, I first masked
with just tape, then I taped down a first &quot;layer&quot; of masking paper (use the
3m stuff, not the bargain basement crap) all the way around, and then
wraped big, continuous, overlapping, layers all the way down, then sealed
the seams with more tape.

&gt;How long should I wait before I put masking tape on fresh paint?

Make sure you have the data sheet that came with your paint, which will
have this information.  Could be anywhere from an hour to several hours.
For the PPG base/clear I was using, it's one hour.
