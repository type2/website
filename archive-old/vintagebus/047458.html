Unless your bus is European is *NEVER* (As of about 1954 or so) came with 
&quot;SEKURIT&quot; windshilds.
Yes, it will &quot;match&quot;, but its not CORRECT!

Yes- I understand the idea of using tempered windsheilds in place of safaris 
so they are easily removable for reinstalling the safaris for nice weather.

Then again,  Doubt you'll find large logo sekurit windsheilds.  And the 
safari arms will still be there, so whatever.

Safety issues?

Just put some windsheilds in.  You'll either crack them taking them out to 
reuse the seals, or eat the cost of a pair of seals.
