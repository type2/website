Subject: Re: [VB] transaxle swap

Did you use the same shift lever and gearshift housing from your old center
section on the &quot;new&quot; center section?

&gt; Well, I drove my '59 bus into work today after swapping the transaxle out
&gt; with another used '67 one I had that was supposed to be good. I've been
&gt; messing with it at home 'cause it seems to exibit the exact same problems
&gt; the one I had in there did. It's all that &quot;2nd&quot; and &quot;reverse&quot; stuff.
&gt; Sometimes when in reverse it pops out into a &quot;mystery spot&quot;. Shifting into
&gt; second is rough and will many times want to grind. Sometimes wants to pop
&gt; out of 2nd.
