As far as the powdercoating, I'm looking at $100-$150 per bumper (including
blasting), and $50 per rim....there's cheaper to be had in SoCal($50-$75
each bumper and $35 per rim), but unless I can find some cheap way to get
them down there and back, I'm stuck in the North Bay Area.  Any leads,
anyone?

Gene

&gt; uprights first?  The blade looked pretty straight, and so did the tube.
How
&gt; much does it cost to get a bumper powdercoated?
