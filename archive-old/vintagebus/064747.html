&gt; Problem with magnetic drain plugs is that they extend too far into the hole 
&gt; and interfere with the bottom of the strainer. 

Hi George,
We had one of those actually push the bottom of the strainer up and partly 
close off the oil sump pick up tube end!

 Second problem is that the area above the drain plug is a stagnent area, 
flow-
&gt; wise.  All the action is above the strainer.
&gt; 
But above the sump plate whilst a stagnent area it is designed like that to 
allow the metal particles to fall there and hopefully get trapped.  The 
problem with this is unless you only drive in a straight line or are dealing 
with a industrial VW motor that operates sitting still, when steering through 
turns the oil in the sump sloshes from one side of the engine to the other 
stirring up the metal particules and allowing them to be sucked up by the oil 
pump once again.
  While magnets will help some by only removing steel/iron debris from the 
oil a full flow filter will remove ALL particules wether steel, iron, 
aluminum, magnesuim, dirt, sand, etc. that are big and small enough to damage 
the bearings.
  When we were given a 40 HP engine from a friend we had gotten addicted to 
VWs.  It had been badly put out of balance by a repair shop that had replaced 
a piston without balancing it to the rest of the pistons.  We balanced the 
rods and pistons perfectly and while in there installed new rod bearings and 
an oil filter/pump.  When the crankshaft broke a little over 10,000 miles 
later the rod bearings showed no tracks scratched in by particules!  Only 
finely polished areas where the thrust and pull of the cylinders affected 
these bearings.
