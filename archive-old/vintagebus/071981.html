&gt; Today I sat in a friends bus and his seat is much more comfortable - it 
&gt; seems to sink more at the back of the base than mine.  I guess mine still has 
&gt; the original padding - anyone got any suggestions as to how to make my seat 
&gt; more comfortable???

Hi Paul,
Do you have the driver 1/3 seat adjusted properly???  There should be two 
adjstment knobs at the base/hinge area where the upper section of the seat meets 
the base part.  These knobs should be adjusted so the seat back is straight up 
or even slightly tilted forward.

&gt;&gt;And how do I remove the covers - is this a job for an upholsteror? &lt;&lt;

You can definitely do it yourself!
