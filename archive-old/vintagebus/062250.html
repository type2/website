Subject: Re: [VB] Safari Windows

I had a bay window Tempered glass windshield in my lap one day in Austria, 

it did not come apart all at once, around the impact area it broke away, but 
the rest just has millions of little cracks, this was at 30-40 MPH

Europe used tempered windshields at least till the mid-70s if not later.......
