&lt;&lt; Did a 62 S/C come with a P shaped key, or the other one? &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
&gt;From what we have seen it seems that earlier buses got the centered looped 
church key used up to the end of door pockets, non-pocket front door paneled 
buses got the &quot;P&quot; shaped church key.  The latter worked much better with the 
zinc plated steel bracket, of the later buses.  Eric&amp;Barb
