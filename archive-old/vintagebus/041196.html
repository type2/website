I've been driving a bus for less than two months now. It admirably and
reliably performs all the necessary chores of a daily driver, but does
come up lacking in the comforts. And the air-cooled engine is always
going to be louder than its water-jacketed counterpart. I've gotten
pretty used to the spartan cab,  the two things I am still missing
(time will heal) are an armrest and a roll-down window. I bet the
baywindow bus has both these things and more, but I have a splitty and
I'm sticking with it.
The lack of any kind of crumple zone up front unnerved me for a while.
I do feel that driving a bus of any era ought to demand more of your
attention than typically used to pilot a newer car. If you are an
inattentive driver or one who is often distracted by your passengers
or cellphone, a bus may not be the best choice for you. So be a good
driver, and a drive a bus...
Joel
