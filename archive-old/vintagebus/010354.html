I don't know about any value as a &quot;collectible&quot;, but.....

Sears &amp; Roebuck was once a very good source of re-manufactured engines in
general, and did a top quality job on VW engines.  They also were a source
for a great many other VW parts and pieces, many of which were Sears' direct
German imports.

If I found a 1600 SP Sears reman. engine in decent shape I'd grab it in a
minute for refurbishing and installation in my Westfalia.
