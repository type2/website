&gt; Steve was on the list...he should be out there
&gt; listening?  His bus was one of the primered buses
&gt; originally...not sure if those guys re-painted the
&gt; front area or not.  But I do have pics burried
&gt; somewhere of the interior beforehand.

Yep.......I'm here   :-)

Todd is right - my '56 was supplied to Westfalia in primer. Bus is now 
painted in what must have been one the quickest blow-over paint jobs 
ever put on a bus (courtesy of last US owners) - but it is still fairly 
soild. Bodywork suffered a little from being stood outside on the south 
coast of England for a couple of years with the PO - will need some 
attention over this coming winter. Still gets me all over Europe every 
summer though!   :-)

And Clara - the engine doesn't throw oil from the crank pulley all over
the engine bay now (like it did when you saw it at Bad Camberg)  :-)

&gt; It was a decent body but missing
&gt; 75% +++ of the westy stuff inside...I think they have
&gt; just the bed frames.  I have pics of this bus when it
&gt; was in its &quot;as found condition&quot;. I think I gave some
&gt; to Thom to put on his Westy page???

I have bed frames plus original table and flip-up seat on bulkhead. 
Missing camping box rear cupboards.......chasing a lead on these though 
and one day it might just come together.......?? Also missing tent.
I sent some pics to Thom - still on his site under Westfalias (page 13)
I do have the original camping box sticker in nice condition on the 
bulkhead table mount - chatted with Thom previously about getting a 
high quality picture of this and getting some reproduced at a sticker 
place......may be still possible.

&gt; I also recall the 2 'geniuses' from PNW that found
&gt; this bus painted it and stripped out all the nice
&gt; original westy wood wall panels to relace it with
&gt; shiney new stuff uggGHHHHH!!!

Said 'geniuses' did leave one or two original panels!   ;-)
Real shame they removed the headliner though.
