Subject: Found a bus BOOTH??!!!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Was at a little diner in Ocean Beach a while ago and happened to see a 
interesting booth.  It was the front of a bus from the middle divider 
foreward.  It was actually really nice too, wish i could put that nose on my 
bus.  Anyone in the san diego area seen it yet?
