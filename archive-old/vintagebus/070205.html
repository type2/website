Subject: Re: [VB] flasher relays

I can't say which is better, but I just found a 12V 9 pin relay for my
'67 at Kelley Park from one of the vendors there. If there is a show
near you, it's a good chance to find one.  Most of these guys don't
advertise on the Internet, so you never know.  The one I found had
been cut out of a scrapyard bus.  I don't know whether it works yet,
but I can probably fix it if it's broken.  My bus had been modified
to use a new standard flasher unit, and the emergency flasher switch
is disconnected.

&gt; I am trying to determine which is better...
&gt; after-market flasher relay vs. newer relay conversion kit
&gt;
&gt; I have to replace this item in my '67 bus and was told that they don't
exist
&gt; by one parts store and was offered a conversion kit.
&gt; Another parts store said that aftermarket relays were available and I
could
&gt; order one.
