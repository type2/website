&lt;&lt; Is the fluid of the transmission, differential and redux boxes all common 
fluid or are these separate supplies of fluid?&gt;&gt;
Common!  Matter of fact if you get a bad RGB leak the tranny center section 
is designed so that about 1/2 of the tranny oil will drain down the axle tube 
to keep the reduction from going dry immediately allowing a good VW driver 
time to discover the leak and repair it or at the least to keep adding new 
oil to keep the entire tranny/reduction full.

&lt;&lt;What fluid should I put into the boxes and the tranny? &gt;&gt;
90Wt or 85/90Wt is good with GL-4 rating.   Eric&amp;Barb
