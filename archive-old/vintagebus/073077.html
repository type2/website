Subject: Re: [VB] coffee cup holder for vintage bus?

Hey Dave,
On my 63 Double cab, I took one of those plastic
holders that have a thingy that hangs over the door at
the base of the window on modern cars and then cut the
little &quot;L&quot; shape from it, then drilled a hole and put
it on where one of my door panel screws are: it works
great!!!

&gt; I am wondering if anyone has designed a cup holder

&gt; wish I had one in my 57 double door van. How are you
&gt; all dealing with this
&gt; popular accessory?
