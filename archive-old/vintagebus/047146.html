Subject: RE:[VB] need a idle cutoff solenoid  
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Snoopy,
Congrats you have one of the early cutoff solinoids that also acts as a idle 
jet.  So you need to figure what size you have and if you need a differant 
sized one if what you have now is incorrect for your engine size, year of 
engine compartment, air cleaner and type of muffler!  Best to replace it with 
a normal idle jet or see if you can adjust the screw in the end of this idle 
cut off jet to keep the jet open.   Eric&amp;Barb
