I think we need a one more bit of information to figure this out. Was
the drum on and the axle nut tightened when this leak happened, or did
you put in the seal and gaskets, fill the RGB and wait to see if it was
going to leak before you put the drum back on?

The reason I ask is because the little o-ring on the stub axle has to be
compressed by the seal race in order to seal. If the drum isn't on and
the nut tight, then gearlube can leak past the o-ring and run out from
between the seal race and the axle. This isn't as much of a problem
after things have been together a while, so it doesn't usually show up
during a brake job. It's more of a problem with new parts.

Hope that helps.
