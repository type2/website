Subject: Friday,,,,Mystery part test

Hi all

I have a Vw item, that I wonder if anyone can Identify,,
http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/part3.jpg 
here is a picture, a view of each side,, there 2 marks on it,, and one is a Vw
emblem,, it is hard to see in the picture,, 
there is 3 tabs as such, one has the emblem on it,, the other if you look close
has a small pointer,, arrow head index type mark,,, 
it is overall about the size of a quarter... the thread is about the size of a
dime,, and it is about 1/2&quot; think

What are your guesses!
