Subject: Distributor Q (where do I find)

Hi Y'all
The tinkertoy goes back together tomorrow after a 'rest' while I got a
head warranteed to replace the flame burnt one. I've got the standard
Bosch 009 dizzy in the Tinkertoy.  Most of my driving is light to light
here in Miami and not Highway.  I'm really considering a vacum advance
dizzy to replace to 009 but all I see offered is 009.  I'm probably
missing something huh?  Does anyone know where I can find one at
reasonable cost (comparable to what I see 009s going for)?   

I have to 'fess up too.  I was bad-typing Chirco in Tuscon due to a
previous bad experience.  They warranteed the engine I bought from them
and so I was (as usual) too quick to blast away without giving someone a
chance.  That's the trouble with the almost instantaneous communication
capabilities offered by modern technology.  But I digress.

p-mail or post, 'cause this is about the only civilized list I've found
so I read faithfully.

Dave
Tinkertoy (67 std)
