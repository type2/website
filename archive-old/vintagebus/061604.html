Ah, but there is a dipstick sender for the VDO Gauge - VDO PN 323081 at
about $44 when I last checked - Ronnie prolly has 'em cheaper.

Dipstick senders tend to read about 10 to 20 degrees hotter on the average
than the oil plate mounted variety, mostly because the &quot;stick&quot; transduces
heat from the sleeve it mounts into.  At least that's been my experience.
Strictly personal, but I believe the oil plate sender offers the best
accurate reading.

The sender for the Oil Relief Plug hole would be VDO PN 323064 I believe
(M18x1.5 Thread).  Last price I saw was about $15 for this puppy.  How
accurate?  I dunno, never used this sender before.
