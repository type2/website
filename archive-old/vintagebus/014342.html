Subject: [VB] straight axle conversion ???????
Message-ID: &lt;19991219233408.91764.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

does anyone have a step by step on how to do a wolfsgang straight axle 
conversion or a opinion on it.i would love to do this but i would love to 
see what i will be getting into.or does anyone have some pics of their 
conversion?i see it is probably easier to use a bug trans but i was 
wondering about the rear drums and lug pattern because i really want to stay 
with the big lug pattern.let me know.

thanx
mike
