On our way back from the OCTO and Classic weekend it was getting very 
difficult to get the shifter in gear, especially third. We experienced no pop 
out and made it home. After I crawled under the bus and looked at the front 
shift rod where it connects to the rear shift rod I found  instead of a set 
screw the connection was drilled and a bolt put through.The holes on both 
rods are elongated and causes movement between the two shift rods. So,I am in 
need of the front and rear shift rods for my 66 deluxe. Is there a supplier 
out there? I've looked in all my catalogs and all I can find are the couplers 
for them. Wolfsburg West has a front shift rod, but it says that it is only 
for '60-'62.
 Thanks to all! Janet
