I would like to get some price suggestions for a used 71 bus engine.  I
think that would be a 1600.  I don't know if it is a dual port or single
port.  The owner is parting out the bus and said it used to run.  The bus
lived on the coast and is pretty well rusted out.  I will plan on rebuilding
the engine.  Thank you for any suggestions.
