Hey JP,
  Is camping available both Friday and Saturday nights?  I just got it 
okayed with the &quot;boss&quot;.  This trip is going to be my birthday present.  I'll 
probably stop in Amarillo for the night and then get into Albuquerque 
Friday.  I guess its still a ways off, just wanted to plan ahead. I'm 
looking forward to meeting some more list members.

later,
Wayne

&gt;
&gt;Somebody said there's no such thing as a free lunch,
&gt;but it's not true!  At Busses and Balloons V here in
&gt;Albuquerque this October 6th, one of our sponsors,
&gt;Foreign Aide, is giving a free lunch w/ a Southwestern
&gt;flair to anyone attending the show!
&gt;
&gt;How much better can it get, Balloons, Busses, and free
&gt;food?  And if Ronnie and John come from Havasu,
&gt;there'll probably be a free taco or two for the
&gt;campers Friday night!
&gt;
&gt;Check it out at http://onearth_dot_com/2001show/ and make
&gt;your plans to attend.
&gt;
&gt;JP
