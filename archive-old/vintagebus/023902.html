H CASES SUCK!

A case carrying an 'A' prefix would be far superior.
There are many problems with the 'H' cases. The first
one is an alloy problem that VW ran into. The 'H' material
was too soft, so it pulls studs WAY too easy. Not only was
the material soft, but there weren't any case savers either.
They had small oil galleys, a single pressure relief, and 
small pump studs just to name a few more problems. I'm sure 
that there is more too, but those are all I can think of right
now..... Anyone have some more input?

Chris
