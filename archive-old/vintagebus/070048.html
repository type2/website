Probably.  Certianly, I'd say.

You could probably do it by hand if you're really careful, at least enough
to hold it together to get you home.....if you do it this way you'd better
plan on /only/ making it home. :)

Call around to machine shop's in the area you're in.  Anyone with a good
size lathe or drill press (it would need to be large enough to mount the
engine into...) should be able to do it.  (using the lathe you'd mount the
engine to the non-rotating end of the bed...)

It'd be a bitch of a job, but should be doable.  Setup costs for the job,
if the shop isn't symathetic (or just up for a challenge..:) have the
potential of being higher then teardown/rebuild costs, though.
