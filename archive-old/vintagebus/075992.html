Subject: Re: [VB] Re: preventing engine fires

&gt;It would be interesting to take a plastic filter and a glass filter, fill
&gt;them with gas, and bash them around to see which one breaks first.  Most
&gt;of the glass filters I've seen are quite thick and well armored with
&gt;metal.  I'd bet that the plastic filters would leak first!

or deform under extreme engine bay heat! i've seen some that resemble 
a calabash squash more than a cylinder...
i haveta admit, i liked using them for monitoring whether the pump 
worked and eyeing dirt/rust from the tank, but i eventually  decided 
the filter screen in the tank, in the barndoor fuel cutoff switch and 
the TWO in the fuel pump should get much of the bad stuff before the 
carb, rendering any engine compartment filters moot.

btw, if you do use an inline filter, hang it from the gas tank, after 
your cutoff switch.
