&gt;  So remember if you bid
&gt; $50.00 Maximum for a N.O.S.Oval speedo someone will bid $100.00 because they
&gt; want it more than you do. that's the American way.
&gt; Thanks ,

Yeah, but at the swap meet, no one walks up during the last seconds of a
transaction and snatches it out of your hand then gives the guy a buck more.
Right?
