&gt; PS: And I'm on a bummer right now as something just popped in

&gt; the engine back out, in January no less.... :-(

I'll bet on a broken clutch fork or dropped throwout bearing retainer
spring.  These seem to occur on &quot;fresh&quot; clutches for some reason.  I
always weld up or replace suspect forks and safety wire the retainer
springs.  This failure seems to illustrate Murphy's law rather well.
