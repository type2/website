Well all, I've been working quite dilligently towards getting the 66 into
town so I can actually start working on it.  There have been several things
that I've been trying to decide on for my 66.  Here is a list of my concerns
and what I've decided upon.  I think that the results will suit me fine,
keep the true spirit of VWness, and be pleasing to the list.

1)  IRS Conversion or not?

    When I owned my 71 Westy, I hated being stuck at 60mph.  The thought of
cruising around at 53mph in my 66 wasn't too thrilling of a proposition to
me.  I've ridden in a bus with a 1641cc engine and an IRS conversion (4.12
gearing) was was really pleased with the ride and the speed.  I actually
felt quite strongly towards to converting to IRS for a few moons.  I almost
resented people on the list begging me not to do this as I felt it wasn't
their money and it wasn't their bus.  However, I plan on using my bus to get
to old fishing holes, road tripping, etc. so it seemed like ground clearance
would be an issue.  After much thought and coaxing by a bunch of you
listees, I've decided, without a doubt, to keep the bus stock with the
exception of the transmission.  I've located a bus tranny with 3.88 gearing
(it's on its way) so I will be able to cruise 65 to 70 and even faster if I
use a C/W crank in my powerplant.

2)  6v or 12v?

    The age old tale of whether to keep the bus 6v or 12v - I've tangled
with this one and I have come to the conclusion that there is honor and
prestige in keeping the ol' girl 6v.  I was quite surprised when I discussed
the issue with my workmates (of whom some are vintage Chevy and Ford people)
and without any prompting on my part, they unanimously agreed that I should
keep the bus 6v.  At that point, I thought if even they could see the
greatness of leaving everything 6v, then by god I'm going to leave it alone.
My mom grew up in the world of 6V and she said that she remembers that when
a 6v battery started going bad, you would have up to 2 weeks' notice that
your battery was going bad.  It would just gradually crank slower and slower
each time until it wouldn't crank anymore.  My dear ol' mom actually said
she hates 12V because when the battery goes dead, it often times does (snap
your fingers) just like that.  The only thing I'm waiting on for now is Ty
Hodges Tech article on how to rig a series/parallel switch so I can run two
6 volt batteries with a 12v tap up front for those 12v items I want to run.
Maybe I'm not a purist but at least the bus will be.

3)  Here is one I haven't decided on yet and I hope you can help me out.
Since my bus is a deluxe, I have the chrome trim all the way around and I'm
going to need that rubber strip the inserts into the trim.  I know you can
get enough to do a whole bus for $25 and it comes in a skillion different
colors.  What color would be best with a white-over-red combo?  The original
color of this bus was all white with white trim.  Does anyone have any
suggestions?  I want my bus to be white over sealing wax red.  Well actually
white over Indian Red.  I have a $164 gallon can of paint (PPG) sitting here
that was meant for my 74 Super.  That's right, it's the same red that Super
Beetles were painted with in 1974.  So what the hell - I'll use it.

I guess that's all the ramblings for now.  As soon as my 5th rim shows up, I
can start sandblasting, fixing the clips, and getting them powdercoated.
Then, as soon as I get tires mounted and balanced, the 66 will be ready to
tow into town!

All for now guys and gals...
