All this talk of spare parts reminded me of when I went to get a 61 15
window from St Louis. I had a box of spares that was pretty much everything
I could think of besides a new motor. If you're a member of NEATO, take
some good stuff to trade if you need a motor since you can use the TTD to
find somebody almost antwhere you break down.
   I took one of everything that could make the bus not move under it's own
power:a spare carb, a complete distributer, a set of front and rear wheel
bearings, a spare set of heads, some fuel line, a few fan belts,  a spare
windshield wiper (which I used when it flew off in the dark on the mountain
40 miles west of Neil Pickett's house). And a full tool box with a floor
jack under the seat. I also took stuff like NOS front wheel cylinders
(55-63 style) to trade if I had to, along with some other stuff that would
make a good trade. I took all this stuff out in the car when I went to see
the bus, then flew back out 6 months later to get it. I took 2 pairs of
tires duct taped together as checked baggage, and a duffel bag for clothes,
and another box of tools. I made it all the way back to VA even though it
took 3 days and about 5 gallons of oil because the motor was eating itself
where the crank pulley snout is. But I still made it, the thing to do is
just take all the stuff that is kinda small and if you need something big,
somebody in the Tourist Traveler Directory will be within driving distance
to bring any big stuff you need. I'd drive up to 150 miles if somebody was
stranded. And I'm sure there are other people who would too.
