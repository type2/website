We're ALL writers here, some are paid.

I started drilling out the 45 pop rivets in my doublecab bed a week ago with
mixed feelings. A lot of work but the sub-bed was solid and dry, mostly.
After spinning a few of them, grabbing pliers and yanking them off, I paused
for inspiration. Cut them off with something sharp. Got out the
soon-to-be-old wood chisel and dead-bow hammer. Lost some paint around them,
but used a sealant around the new bolts and wood. The chisel can be
sharpened.

Another problem I had was solved by the RAMVA list. I have new interior
panels and didn't mark the screw holes from  the old ones. They were water
warped anyway. Here's the tool...  A 4-5&quot; piece of steel strapping, about
1/2&quot; wide. Fold the strap lengthwise, in half. Crimp the fold flat in a vise
or vise-grip. Drill one tiny hole (thumb-tack shaft size) through the free
ends about 1/2&quot; from the edge. Glue a tack so it'll poke out one hole.
Use the tool: Hold the panel in place with one hand, put the tool over the
panel with the other, find the hole with the tack and mark the hole with
your third hand.
