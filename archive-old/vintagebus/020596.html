Hello World  I will pull my head out of my
aahhhh....engine compartment long enough to write the
capture and tagging and release of electrical wires
and other various things is underway on Ol'No
Name.Could not drive it the way it was (not over
40mph)loss of power sooooo in I go.I would rather
drive than work on it or a job but there comes a
time.No big hurry here so plenty of time for beers and
naps.It is a mess in there...scarry looking (worn) gas
lines....that new carbs electric idle cutoff switch is
already loose (got about 30 miles on it) Had a small
fire back there years ago so the electric lines to
both tail lights and license plate light...well darn
all those wires need changing out back there.Need tail
light housings and 2 back up light housings and seals
....license plate housing...well you get my drift.Got
to change out the headlights to...the whole deal from
light to chrome rings both sides mine look beat up and
worn out.The sunny side up turn signals housings and
lenses are beat to.Never had a turn signal switch
inside the cab so got to figure that out....I feel a
nap coming on....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
