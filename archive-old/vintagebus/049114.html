Emmet:

My comment wasn't directed toward poking fun at your need for blueprints, but at your question as to why no one tried to reproduce camper interiors.  Companies did, and obviously with not GREAT success.  So my point was that is probably why no one tries it in modern times.

Didn't mean to get under any thin skin bro.

heh, hell if i would ever want to make finished products except for myself.
I have 2 business' allready and a fulltime job, no need for another
headache.  Blueprints were all i were interested in.  The only thing the
cabinet shop was gonna help me with was standardized tech drawings.  I'm no
draftsman.  As for the comment below...  well, if they were still around i
wouldnt have the question would i?

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Uhhhh, I belive several groups of folk tried it already, about 35 years
ago.  I believe they called themselves, Sundial, EZ and Riviera.
