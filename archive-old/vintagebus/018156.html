&gt; Thanks for the tip, but get this all. The guy selling this particular sunroof 
&gt; on ebay is the same one who sold my buddy the bus and said he already sold 
&gt; the sunroof on top of other things. My buddy made the mistake and showed too 
&gt; much interest in the bus before he saw it, which is where he messed up, but 
&gt; it is just mesed up that people would take advantage of other people like 
&gt; that. At least there are far fewer people like this in teh VW community than 

I wouldn't be so sure about that - there are tons of stories just like that.
It's *VERY* common to pull all the choice parts off the car, then offer to
&quot;locate&quot; said parts for the buyer, in effect, getting more for the car than
they could have if it was all in once piece to start with.
