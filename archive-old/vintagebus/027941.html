Hey all!
I'll be heading over to MI on either tuesday or wednesday.... plans were
originally for me to stay in Ludington until thursday, and that may
still happen....but I don't know what I'm going to do for thursday
during the day/night....and even friday.  I don't mean to sound invading
or anything, but are there any MI listees that would be open to some bus
converstation...and let me park in their drive with my P*nti_at_c?  I need
something to occupy my time until the dinner on Friday night... even any
IL listees...

I won't be driving my buses...sadly enough...unless Stella magically
heals herself!...but I'd like to meet some of you fine folk.

Thanks!
Isaiah
