&gt; Todd,
 When you
&gt; change stuff like this, you are changing history. Say down the road, way down
&gt; the road, someone is going to put back what you did, and they are going think
&gt; they had a sunroof standard or kombi when in fact they have a hardtop with a
&gt; hole in its head! Its the same as counterfiting money, or even worse.

Mike,                                  
Give me a huge break!
I'm as much a pervert for stock and correct as anyone. The guys at the
VW shop I work at give me crap all the time about my painted hubcaps.
But you gotta remember that its just a piece of metal. Just a machine. I
hate to see them go away, but if someone is making it what they want and
is going to use it, then they don't deserve this kind of brow-beating. 
Counterfitting money, bullsh*t. These were cheap, reliable, usable,
flexible vehicles, that could be made to perform a variety of tasks.
That so many survive is a testament to their engineering, but we
shouldn't act like they are sacred. 
VW itself provided dealers with plans to change a commercial or even
passenger bus into an assortment of different configurations. Many
involved cutting and welding. Creativity was encouraged. What does it
matter if it was done to a new vehicle purchased in 1963, or one someone
pulls out of a field in 1998? Or buys for a lot of money in Scaramento
or Pomona? 

I personally think lowering a bus is stupid because it makes it a whole
lot less usable. For me, the ability to go almost anywhere in my bus is
a big plus. And I think the ride in a lowered bus sucks. But if someone
wants to lower a bus and use it, what place have I to be offended? 

Hurting a bus' feelings is baby talk. Browbeating someone who is going
in a direction you would not choose with a project is counterproductive
and diminishes the usefulness of the list.
