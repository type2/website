&gt; I know a lot of you on the lists are in
&gt; the computer industry in the US, and this affects *you*
&gt; directly: as we head into a recession and the layoff
&gt; announcements get bigger with each passing day, your
&gt; low-wage replacements are quietly being brought in to
&gt; fill the alleged labor &quot;shortage&quot; - you can't have
&gt; massive layoffs and a &quot;shortage&quot; at the same time, folx.
&gt; Someone is fibbing, and I don't think it's the guy
&gt; with the pink slip and the contents of his desk in a
&gt; cardboard box...

I say don't &quot;even&quot; play the corporate game. Your skills can be marketed
anywhere. Become independant. I did in 1990 and I've never even thought
about looking back.
