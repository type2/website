Subject: 6V starter in 12V tranny...anyone done this I gotta PROBLEM!
To: bus list &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hi, here is the background

Worked on a `66 bus for a buddy.  He has the original
engine which I rebuilt about a year ago.  It is all
original specs doen to 6volt.  OK, his tranny puked
about 6 months ago.  He bought a rebuild which when
came it was a `67 tranny which of course was a 12V set
up.

So, he still wants to run the fresh rebuild motor in
this tranny of course.  I pick up the 12V to 6V
starter adapter bushing.   This thing looked really
thin to me right off..hmmmmm.

Well in goes the bushing, grease and starter.  Thing
works fine and starts great...no problemo.  Well
recently he starts getting hard-slow starting  and a
grinding noise from starter area while running
starter.
So, I pull the starter and see that the tip of the
starter shaft is very beat and scrored up!  I also
notice a liitle metal dust residue on parts.  I feel
up in and the bushing is still in there but seems like
it is a bit eaten away.

Anyhow, I have a new starter and bushing...but am a
bit scared to stick that new $100 starter in only to
ruin it like the last one.  Is this just a fluke or is
it a no no to try to run a 6 volt starter in a 12V
tranny?  

Has anyone done and been driving a 12-6 set up like
this with long term good results or not?  Any
ideas...I wanna cover all options before I pull the
engine and start over.

Tds
