  Thoms story reminds me of the one about how the guy found and retrieved
the 55 I  just bought. The gentleman and his wife were just cruising looking
for anything they could find, then off on some farm/ranch they spotted what
looked like some interesting vehicles in a grove of trees, upon further
inspection they turned out to be 2 buses, a 57 23 window and a 55 Barndoor
Delux. In order for the gentleman to get them out of the grove he told me
they had to cut trees down to get them out, that's how long they were out
there, at least 30 plus years, the weird part was the man who owned the
property had the original titles to both buses, anyway I was sent the title
and photos of the rescue today, so I will get them posted asap.
