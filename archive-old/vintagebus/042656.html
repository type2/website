&gt; Hi, I'm leaving from here in Maryland to go on my annual cross country trip 
&gt; and I really need a full roof rack for all my stuff. My bus is a 67 hardtop 
&gt; westy. A decent to high quality vintage rack is preferred and I have up to 
&gt; 600.00 to spend. I am willing to travel almost anywhere to get it as my 
&gt; plans on my trip are spur of the moment. Please help! I'm leaving thursday 
&gt; so let me know. Thanks, Sam
well,

Im sure this is not what you had in mind, but go to your local hardware
store they sell rain gutter mount racks of all sorts...

take care,

Steve
