&gt;I WAS WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT KNOW OF ANYONE LOOKING FOR THE SINK AND
ICEBOX CABINETS FOR A LATE MODEL WESTIE CAMPER.  I HAVE BOTH IN VERY GOOD
SHAPE.  THEY ARE FROM A '74 BUS.  I REALLY NEED TO GET RID OF THEM AND WILL
SELL THEM VERY CHEAP.  I LIVE IN FLORIDA SO THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM.  ANY
HELP GETTING RID OF THEM WOULD BE GREAT.
