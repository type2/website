Subject: Re: [VB] Front Shift Rod Coupling: Why cut/weld rather than
  tap?

I don't think welding it back together would be a good idea.  Cutting it
lengthwise is the way to get it off without gouging the actual shift rods
too bad to the point where a new coupler would not go on.  Just buy a new
coupler and set screws.

at $8.00+$1.75+$1.75=$11.50 total, I wouldn't trust a weld.

&gt;Why isn't
&gt; tapping out the set pin easier than cutting and then having to weld the
&gt; coupler back together? Is tapping out the pin that difficult? I can
&gt; twist the shifter rod to get a good angle on it.
&gt;
&gt; Also, if the coupler is made of soft metal, it seems that cutting and
&gt; welding would introduce possible fatigue-related failure later on.
