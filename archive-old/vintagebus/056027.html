So when he gets done cutting can I have the left overs? I'd really like to
add it to the back of my Binz so I can have more seating.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; My efforts to find a &quot;pristine&quot; single cab split truck had gone nowhere.
&gt;
&gt; Good news today! A guy told me about a deluxe sitting in a home garage in
&gt; North Carolina just 15 miles from here! I went to look and it is
beautiful.
&gt; Her Chinese grandparents bought the bus to drive to the market in
Asheville
&gt; for supplies for their restaurant. When the suppliers started delivering
on
&gt; the early 1970's, the bus was parked inside. There is no rust on this
thing
&gt; as it has been in the garage since then. It has faded a bit but not bad
for
&gt; original paint. It might be older as she showed me a thingy to stick in
the
&gt; rear to hand start the motor? Never seen that before.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I wonder where I need to make the cut to make it a single cab. I
&gt; might take it a little back and make a double cab &quot;binz&quot; whatever that is.
I
&gt; will need to cut some plywood just right to seal up the rear. Looks like
&gt; those upper windows might get in the way of the cutting. Any ideas about
&gt; what type of caulk to apply to the wood for a good seal?
&gt;
&gt; For $400.00, I cannot go wrong. I should be able to get some measurements
at
&gt; EveryBus but really want to start cutting! Please help with advice or send
&gt; pictures. I have never seen a &quot;real&quot; single cab around here.
&gt;
&gt; Thanx!
