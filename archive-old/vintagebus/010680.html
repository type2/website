I think something is missing from the web site URL  sent-   I would like to 
get free stuff from VWOA.   :(

But ya- there are a number of kinds of wiper arms- and the side bolt kind I 
believe dates from 66/67 and was sold since as a replacement part.  It is a 
better design.

&gt;    Maybe that's why I have taken so many of the side bolt arms off of buses,
&gt; 
&gt;  the originals must have been replaced by the dealer with the ones that have
&gt;  the side bolts?

&gt;  if any of you guys have a set of mangled pivots, and mangled arms, why not
&gt;  get a free set from VWOA???
