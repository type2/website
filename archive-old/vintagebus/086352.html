I agree with Eric &amp; Barb,

That '67 on eBay is a good example of how someone can &quot;restore&quot; a bus  
by putting a nice shiney coat of paint over some rust issues. The  
seller does an honest job of pointing those areas out - but many  
sellers won't be that honest. The seller doesn't show the front floor  
area, deluxe pans (under the cargo area), or underneath/behind the  
doglegs. I'd be critical of those areas before bidding the $18k+ that  
it is at already.

You really have to crawl underneath the bus to get a good idea of how  
the job was done.

That '64 Deluxe (non-sunroof) that is on there is a good gauge of  
what you would want in a bus. Original paint and minimal rust. I  
wouldn't consider it the best deal only because it needs a trans  
rebuild (and probably other related bits).

If you have the cash and are in the market for a premo/restored bus,  
plan to act fast. Nice buses on The Samba commonly sell in a day or two.
