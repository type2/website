You might check these sites out for NEW heaters.  If you sell your bus,
keep the heater.  A good reconditioned old heater will save you a bunch of
money, and are as safe.  Like I have said before, many people tell me gas
heaters are not safe, but no one has personally seen a heater that has
caught itself on fire.

&gt;Hey Rick
&gt;
&gt;Been reading your post about your gas heater seminar,
&gt;so .....
&gt;
&gt;I am looking to add a gas heater to my 67 Camper and
&gt;would like to pick your brain on what I should be
&gt;looking for. I do have duel batteries in the engine
&gt;compartment so I will probably have to mount somewhere
&gt;inside the Bus such as under the rear seat. Since I
&gt;travel with my family I am looking for Safety First,
&gt;heat second.
&gt;I've looked at many used BN4 but they always seem OLD
&gt;and used up.
&gt;What can you recommend??
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance
&gt;Chuck Notmeyer
