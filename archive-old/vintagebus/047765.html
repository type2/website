Hi NQ--
Been there, done that.  Never tried the art angle, but having had some minor 
(civil) scrapes with &quot;city hall,&quot; such a defense might work for someone who
 1) has the bucks to hire an attorney, preferably one who has a flair for 
publicity (such as getting the newspapers on your side) and
 2) has the time and nerves to act in &quot;civil disobedience.&quot;

For the rest of us, the only solution I ever found was MOVE.  And options for 
that will probably run out in a few years.  Even if you cave in and get rid 
of the bus, won't you want another project sometime?  Problem is still there.

A more immediate solution might be to move it around to friends' and 
relatives' homes, not leaving it anywhere long enough to create a problem.  
Just a thought, probably not a solution.--David (why I live in the country)
