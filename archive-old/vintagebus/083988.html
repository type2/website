Subject: Re: [VB] Carb Question

Why not install a 12V choke?

I'd do that, and make sure that the choke turns off.   If your choke is 
sticking on, it'll run rich.
Also, what jets are you using?   If it is jetted too rich, it'll ... run rich.

You can buy a new 30pict 1 manual choke carb.  I have on on the 1600 DP in my 
65 westy, it's lovely.  It also needed rejetting.  It came with a 120 main 
jet and it ran rich.   I dropped it down to a 115.   
about $75 from CB Performance.   

I also had to buy a choke cable  (about $30 to the door from WW) and install 
it, which involved pulling the engine, and pulling the fan shroud to drill 
holes for the choke cable.  I pulled the shroud as I didn't want to drill holes 
in the oil cooler by accident.

But maybe you just need to rejet your carb.  New main jets are available for 
about $3 ea from motorcycle shops.

&gt; 
&gt; I have a 63 Panel that has either a 15 or 1600 single port head with a 28 
&gt; PICT 6V choke (voltage dropped from 12V). The carb is running rich, so rich I'm 
&gt; putting plugs in it every two weeks. I was reading some of the articles in 
&gt; the library and came to a conclusion that the 28 PICT is not the right carb 
&gt; for a 15/1600cc engine or I have some worn jets, dump tube, or something. I 
&gt; rebuilt the carb a couple months ago. I installed everything that comes standard 
&gt; in a carb rebuild kit and the bus runs good when the plugs aren't fouled, 
&gt; does smell of gas real bad though. Anybody have any suggestions on whether I 
&gt; should put in a 30 PICT 3 (H30/31) or try to get some new harder to find parts 
&gt; for the 28 PICT? I like the 28 although I would like to put on a manual 
&gt; choke.
