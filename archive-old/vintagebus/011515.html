Subject: RE: TRP RPT:The List is a COMMUNITY
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

As a new subscriber to the list I wanted to speak out on the 
recent RANT regarding trip reports. IMHO the list is a community
My husband and I have a bunch of neighbors ITRW that look at
us as if we have grown a third head whenever we choose to drive
around in our VDUBS instead of our late model luxury car. I have
actually heard one of them explain to a new neighbor while 
discussing our &quot;unusual interest&quot; in &quot;old&quot; (not vintage) VWS,
&quot;Well they're in computers&quot;. Needless to say we don't have many
meaningful conversations with our real-world neighbors period much
less about air-cooled VWs. That is why we come to the list. To
meet interesting people who have something to say about VWs. If that
something is great technical or source tips. By the way thanks all
who responded to my first posting regarding help with the 64
Westie interior! Trip reports, questions, jokes, etc. I'm all for it
Sure some threads get out of hand, Sure some people strike me as difficult,
clueless, inciteful, witty, etc. But that is what a community is all about!
I am sure that experienced bus people like Thom and others get bored
with green beans asking questions like what weight oil is best, or if they should 
put radials on before the cross country trip. But they patiently answer the same
questions every few months because it serves the community. I want to hear everything
about early buses, dumb questions, trip reports, scores, RANTS, etc. Heck this is
the 90's if you have problem with bandwidth invest in a faster modem and a flat rate
internet provider! 
P.S.
I even enjoyed Jim Ellis Flame about trip reports, although I didn't see how his
Blatent advertisement trying to UNLOAD his 88 Buick has any 
relevance to the list!
P.P.S. 
My husband and I will be in Northern California between the 13th and 17th of August
does anyone know of any &quot;bus happenings&quot; during that time period?
