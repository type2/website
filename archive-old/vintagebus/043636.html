&gt;I pressure washed the tank inside and out, and now the funk -- that is,
&gt;the fuel flows freely.

Be careful in California anytime and in the winter everywhere else.
The Man likes to step on your funk before you buy it...insist on uncut
funk!

&gt;I'm considering sealing the tank.

How will you get gas in it then?  (ducking and running)

&gt;Considering because the FLAPS people looked at me like I was crazy when 
&gt;I started talking about fuel tanks and making broad sloshing gestures
&gt;with my arms.

Go talk to a motorcycle shop.  They do this all the time.  Just remember
that what they sell is made for much smaller tanks, so you might need
two or more bottles of whatever-it-is.  I also have read (Idiot book
maybe?) that small aircraft sometimes use a sealer on the inside of their
fuel tanks...you might inquire at the local general aviation airport.

As I understand it, the usual procedure is something like...

* remove all fittings, rubber hoses, etc
* clean tank of all fuel and dry it out
* put a handful of bolts and nuts, or some clean gravel, in the tank
* slosh the tank around with the stuff in it to knock rust off
* dump out the bolts/nuts/gravel
* pour acid etch solution (sold with the sealer) in the tank
* slosh tank around to etch and further clean everything
* dump acid out (not on your feet...)
* pour sealing solution, kind of thick and goopy, in the tank
* slosh tank around to coat all surfaces
* dump out excess sealer
* wait some time for sealer to &quot;set&quot;
* install tank and fill up...the fuel helps it finish setting.

Good luck!
