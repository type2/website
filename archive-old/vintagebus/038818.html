Please mark your event calendars on Aug 12 for the Lincoln Square car show
in Chicago.  Although it is not a Volkswagen specific car show, Lincoln
Square (www.lincolnsquare_dot_org) is at the heart of Chicago's German community
and I would like to a see major VW turnout there.

The show will be located on the 4700 N. block of Lincoln Ave.(at
Lawrence)and there will be a band as well.  The Chicago Brauhaus will be
serving beer &amp; brats.  Hope to see some of you guys there.
