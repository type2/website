Subject: RE: [VB] pimpride steering wheels

When I had my panel &quot;restored&quot; they said they put on a
Flat 4 Wheel and it flexed too much, so they put on a
Koch wheel which was &quot;OK...&quot;, but I'm definitely ready
for Chris to repro some more.  I might even have some
cores...

Ronnie saith,
&gt;   They are made by Flat 4 and sold and imported
&gt; through Moon Eyes. They are
&gt; flimsey and would bend if you tried to pull yourself
&gt; up in your bus with
&gt; them.
