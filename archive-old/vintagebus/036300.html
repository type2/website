which one should I go to the event that has been on the saturday before the classic for years or the guys that think they can just put on a show the same day as anouther show in the same area.  I think that it is wrong of octa to do this.  SOTO has the dibs on this day for event and soto was first.  so all the people that are going to octa should rethink it and go to the event that was there first and that will be a better show.

please let me know what you think
