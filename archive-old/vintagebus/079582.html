Subject: Re: [VB] RE:67 original ignition

if the locks are 67, just read the little number on the side of the part that screws to the dash, and that should be the key number. i had that done for my 67, all i did was send the number that i read, and i got keys in the mail. i got it for VERY cheap from a guy up here in georgia. and it works great!
