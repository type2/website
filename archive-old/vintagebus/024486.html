Subject: Re: Rear hatch seal

Also, the seal for the rear hatch is REALY EXPENSIVE! Does nayone know
if
there is a good substitute available in a hardware store or something?

I just installed a brand new rear hatch seal from West Coast Metric in
my 67 westy and it is flawless.  I know that they are expensive but in
the long run you will be much happier.  For one, it will be a perfect
fit and two, it won't leak.  I think the seal is a german repop but I
might be wrong.
