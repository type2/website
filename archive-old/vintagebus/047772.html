To All:

Regarding the radiator placement problem, Fred Stoermer mentioned... 
&lt;&lt;Commercial vessels, and quite a few pleasure cruisers, use a system
called a keel cooler.  In its simplest form it's just a couple of runs of
metal pipe/tubing lying lengthwise along the boat's bottom, just above
the keel, functioning as a heat exchanger.

Perhaps a similar arrangement, it's efficiency enhanced by the addition
of longitudinal fins, would do the job on an H2O-cooled conversion to a
Type 2.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------

Fred (and the List),

This is one of the better ideas I've received.  Unfortunately, it fails the 
test of practicality, largely due to factors of cost and weight.  Here's 
why...

The radiator that came with the Soob turns out to be for the 2.2 liter 
engine.  It is a new (!) unit, apparently installed when the engine was 
replaced.  The active cooling core (ie, cans not included) consists of two 
banks of 27 brass water tubes, each about half an inch wide and slightly more 
than a sixteenth of an inch thick.  Each tube is soldered to its neighbor 
with an accordian-folded strip of copper that zig-zags back and forth eight 
times per inch, meaning each 'zig' uses one inch of copper strip.  Since the 
stuff is half an inch wide that means there are four square inches of it for 
every inch of run... and since it can radiate heat from both of its surfaces 
we have 8 square inches-worth... and since there are two banks of water tubes 
and since the outer banks have zig-zags on their outer edges, we end up with 
4,876 square inches of copper strip.  But we also have the surface of those 
54 water tubes, each of which is 23 inches long.  

The bottom line is that the radiator has a surface-area of 6,118 square 
inches -- about 42 square feet (!).

But what really makes the thing work is how far the heat-beasties have to 
travel to reach a radiating surface -- about .030&quot;, on average.  

The weight of the radiator, including two fans and the heavy steel bracket, 
is 20.1 pounds.  The total coolant capacity is 5.8 quarts -- 11.6 pounds.  
Obviously the water is recirculated at a high rate, which says the 
pressure-drop across the radiator is probably fairly low. 

Now consider a similarly sized 'keel cooler'.  I would need 216 feet of  3/4&quot; 
diameter copper pipe to get the same surface area... and the mean heat-flow 
path would be on the order of .35&quot; (ID of three-quarter copper is .701&quot;), 
meaning you would have to slow down the flow of coolant through the system to 
insure the heat would have time to reach a cooling surface.  But worst of 
all, 216 feet of three-quarter inch copper pipe contains almost 5 gallons of 
fluid -- almost 40 pounds, plus the weight of the pipe itself -- about 46 
pounds, to say nothing of the fittings and brackets and... 

There are some other problems relating to this form of heat transfer device 
-- installation location, air flow and so forth -- before we can even get to 
the difficulties of frabriation and cost.  But I didn't get that far.  I 
abandoned the idea once I saw how heavy it would be.

(So why are keel coolers so effective?  Mostly because water is 800 times 
thicker than air... and usually a lot cooler, to boot.)

------------------------------------------

The bottom line is that I need to couple about 1200 BTU's per minute to the 
atmosphere.  And  that's a bunch.  That's why the effective radiating surface 
of the typical radiator is as large as as space-blanket.  (Read the tag on 
your water heater.  That is for BTU's per HOUR.)

The deck-lid radiator mounting appears to be the most popular.  (Indeed, if 
you'll check the archives you'll see it was the method used on the Ford V6 
powered 'loaf I found in a local junkyard and mentioned to the List several 
years ago.)  This is the method Jack Maynard mentioned in a recent post and 
the method Mark (cncvw_at_primenet_dot_com) is actually driving in his 
Soobie-powered crew-cab.  A search of the internet will offer other 
cooling-system examples -- the Road Cow with her roof-top radiator and a 
heavy-metal V8 in which the radiator is cleverly disguised to look like a 
spare tire, mounted on the nose.  (VERY intricate bit of plumbing... sorry I 
don't have the address but the Road Cow thread will take you there.)

So I have lots of examples -- and plenty of suggestions -- to draw from.  
What I don't have is a lot of money.  That pretty much locks me into using 
the radiator I have.  Nor do I have a lot of weight to play with -- all up, 
including the radiator &amp; plumbing, the Subaru installation will add at least 
68 pounds to the weight of the vehicle... forever.  It will be there climbing 
every hill and it will be there every time I put on the brakes.  That is an 
extra 68 pounds I must accelerate up to speed every time I pull away from a 
stop sign.  Even worse, it's located aft of the rear wheels -- it offers a 
significant moment-arm to the suspension.

(Is the weight really that important?  It is to me :-)  I like to stop.  For 
me, the ability to stop will always have a higher priority than the ability 
to go.  The Subaru engine will probably allow me to cruise at a slightly 
higher speed, meaning the brakes will have that much more energy to get rid 
of when I want to stop.  But the real reason has to do with the possibility 
of the propane conversion -- the 40 gallon propane tank I want to use weighs 
a bunch.  Almost a bunch and a half :-)

So for now, I'm still thinking, still poking at the problem with a mocked-up 
cardboard radiator and mocked-up plumbing runs made out of paper tubes.  (If 
you see me waving a mocked-up welding torch and hissing between my teeth, 
you'll know I've been on the job too long :-)

Structurally and in terms of functionality, the radiator-in-front is the 
hands-down common-sense winner.  But aesthetically, it's dead last on my 
list.  Grendel is after all, a splittie.  If I were working on a 'loaf, I'd 
probably be done by now :-)   ...with the radiator grinning between the 
headlights.
