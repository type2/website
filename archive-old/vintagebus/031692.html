 The repo duel port center sections are cut for both the narrow base and
wide base carbs, so universal.
  If you get lucky you can sometimes find the narrow base center sections.
These were used on some beetles and I think 71 bus used these also.
  There are only 3 carbs available in the country now unless you get lucky
and find some shop with a 30 pict 1 electric choke model (these were
discontinued over a year ago). Everyone sells the same carbs.
  Bocar and Brosol are the only aftermarket carb manufacturers.
  Some of the new 30/31 carbs come with the adapter.
 There are 2 34 pict 3 available one without the idle down arm (you can
replace the jets in these) and the K Cal model which you cannot replace the
jets in (different size jets)
  The only 30 pict 1 available at this time is the manual choke model

ronnie  to many carbs to think about

If you used your 28 you will need one of those SP to DP cab adaptors.  Same 
deal if you use a 30/31 or any other SP carb.  Some people enjoy the 34s-
the 
DP carb that take no adaptor, but then again some people find them
problematic

&gt;  my original is a 1600 single port, the new ones are dual port, so i 
believe 
&gt; i
&gt;  will need a new carb(the 28 pict won't fit the new manifold)
&gt;  
&gt;  My options:
&gt;  30/31 pict electric choke
&gt;  34-pict-3
&gt;  or something else?
&gt;  
&gt;  what do you guys recommend?
&gt;  Mileage/reliability is more important than acceleration.
&gt;  
&gt;  any reccommendations, suggestions?
