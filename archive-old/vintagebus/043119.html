Not the only difference..._dot_completely actually.  The M215 and the M216
both incorporated driven gears with a tooth configuration that made them
what was considered very low geared for especially mountainous terrains.

&gt;  i heard that the 63 rear end was one year only.  I thought what i heard
&gt; the optional 215 or is it M216?   stub axle yes is longer.  But have driven a 
&gt; bus with one of those and one normal- the only difference is that the side 
&gt; wioth the longer stub axle got thick washers under th eaxle nut.  hm- but 
&gt; some people may really want the optional stub axles
