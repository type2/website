I called the guru tonight and he told me that it was quite odd that the 1 &amp;
2 side weren't firing at all.  I found it a bit odd myself and he thought I
might have an electrical problem.  I'm going to go with what I know works
before I tear everything down.  Tomorrow I'm going to buy a new dizzy cap
(I'm using a used one) and plugs.  Then I'm going to take off the dual carbs
and Berg linkage and rebuild a 34 pict 3 I have in the carb pile and put
this engine back to stock.  I think by going this route, I'll be able to
determine the true condition of the engine and tackle the problems one step
at a time.  I should still be able to run my ratio rockers with a stock carb
shouldn't I?

Anyway, here's the results of the compression check:

                             Wet            Dry

Cylinder No.  1        68                72

                    2        70                68

                    3        120                100

                    4        100                100

I know the 1 and 2 side is way low but the guru said it should still hit.
Also, tonight I was getting quite a bit of white smoke which my brothers
insist is oil smoke and I think it's fuel related.  Isn't blue oil and white
fuel?

All fer now...
