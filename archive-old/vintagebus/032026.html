heres the vin #. 1121219 whats the scoop???

it came with some grey interior panels and a grey back seat. but a como green
middle seat. and como green sun visors. but no headlinder seems like it was
como green and was worth something so they took it out.  and there is a
sticker that says:
seeblau 360
cumuluswie8 680

not sure if the sticker is stock cause the bench seat portion has been cut out
then welded back in. messed up. stuff.  

well now the bus is stripped no windows no interior. next step motor, steering
column/wheel, gagues.

But...
   i am wondering whether to Sand Blast, Bead Blast, or grind and sand.  

bead blasting sounds the best but the grinding and sanding is defenitly
cheapest.
remember im only 17 working 2 jobs to support my collection.

speaking of corner windows.  I need 1 both the ones in there were bad. damn
kids with bee-bee guns.  i have 1 good spare.  I NEED ANOTHER ONE.  

thanks.
