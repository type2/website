&gt; You'd think that Charlie H. would at least have a commercial class at
&gt; OCTO seeing that he's such a commercial bus/truck kind of guy.  That
&gt; said, he did put me in the front row at this years OCTO.  I felt a bit
&gt; like a mule at a thoroughbred show ;-)

Yeah, well last year he rode over to me on his bike &amp; asked what the hell I
was doing(in the Dodge minivan!)
