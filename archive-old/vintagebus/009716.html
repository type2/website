Speaking of por 15 and brushes...
I decided to do the inside of the fresh air vent while I had it
open to replace the seals. I couldn't believe there wasn't more rust than
there was considering the amount of water that had been coming in during a
good
rain storm. This due only to the low miles on the bus. VW didn't seem to
take
many precautions against rust up there.  The only part really painted is
half of the
air flap. The rest just gets primer.  After some rust desolver  and and some
wool on the front area,
I decided the best method for putting on the Por, would be a 2.5 inch foam
roller.
I was using semi-black and it went on niiiice. Just used a brush to get the
cracks,
corners and crevices. Ok, the back half wouldn't be so easy.
I had a leftover sponge brush,( you know, the ones that look sorta like a
trowel?
A little hard to get your hand in there. I took off the grill on the back of
the vent and
went in with some sandpaper wrapped around a 2&quot;x4&quot; block of wood threaded
onto a 4' paint brush extension. This worked great for getting the loose
stuff off.
Even on the sides. I then wrapped it with a rag with some solvent.
When it was all clean, I taped up the  area around the opening,
attached the  roller brush and went to town. That little roller made it a
piece of cake. I was able to do nearly the entire vent. Not quite as
thorough a job
as the front as far as the corners, but I feel much better about the inside
of my vent now.
Aaaaaah...
After seeing the design in there, I think It's not a bad idea to point the
nose down-hill after
driving in the rain!
