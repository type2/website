Subject: RE: [VB] Fuel pump hose orientation q-solved!

Found my answer at http://www.i405_dot_com/VW/stand/fuelpump_alternator1.jpg I
have the same pump, lines are backwards input top, output lower, 180
different than german OE. Somewhere Bentley couldn't help me. Thanks for all
the help, I will try this when I get home tonight, I am sure with success.

Subject: [VB] Fuel pump hose orientation q


Has anyone encounted any pump that drew from the top hose and pumped to carb
form lower tube? Sound illogical, but checking for my no fuel diagnosis.
