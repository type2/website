Subject: Re: [VB] No Engine ID

Its a metalizing treatment like I've seen on aircraft engines in light
aircraft.
My Type IV cases tell point of origin on the lower oil pan sides, I can't
see these because of the add on 2 quart pan.
Heads are dual port, No Doghouse it has remote cooler and filter. It has
a block off plate between the generator/alternator pedestal and the
distributor.

Thanks
Stan

Hmm, did someone paint the case with black &quot;crinkle paint&quot;?  
Alternately, there may be no number at all if the case or engine was
replaced.  My Mexican engines have no numbers.
 
Other cluess:  single/dual port?  Doghouse tin?  dates in heads?  If it's
a late model dual port it is probably a 1600.
