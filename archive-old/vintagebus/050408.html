HI Ya!

Yes, they are, VW Howard has not yet replied to my message to him about the 
purchase of them yet that was almost if not a week ago.  IF you are out there 
Howie and you want the bumpers, you have to e-mail in the next day in order 
to get them, (or the one) or I will sell them(it) to John here!

Buy the way john Make me an offer on them both, and the front one if that is 
all I have.

Later
chris.
