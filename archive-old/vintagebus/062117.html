Subject: RE: Tire research

Thanks Matt.  That was very interesting.

The main problem is that there are plenty of tires in the 205/75/R15 size
but none that are LT rated.

The only way I know of to gain the LT rating is to step up to the 215/75R15
where many LT tires are available.  I know people who run this setup without
problems, even though the 15&quot; rims are skinny.

Right now I am running BFG Long Trail T/A tires in the rear on 15&quot;x4.5&quot; rims
with 205/75R15 tires.  These are not load rated tires, but do have a truck
tire tread pattern for off road adventures (not tested yet).  They are
pretty squishy on the road even pumped up to the max of 35 PSI... Granted
better than el cheepo car tires.  

You might like the Pirelli P400 Touring tire in a 205/75R15.  The Touring
grade of tires seems to me would be perfect for a passenger bus.  They
should be firmer than normal tires but nice for cruising.   

In a perfect world I would get 15&quot;x5.5&quot; rims and just run 215/75R15 LT
tires.  But I do not know of a 15x5.5 aftermarket rim that looks like the
bus stock wheels.


Good Luck,
