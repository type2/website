Trying to set the timing, at 10 degrees BTDC statically, as was suggested to
me by Steven Howell, thanks again btw. Thing is, I have my lead hooked to
the wire on the back of the distributor, but, the light is always on. The
other day when I tried to time it, it was onlyon when #1 fired, and if I
backed it off, the light went off, like its supposed to? But now, it just
stays on, I rotated the engine a complete turn and it stayed on the whole
time. I'm lost, please tell me I didn't destroy anyything. The bus ran fine
all last summer, I just want it to run like that again. Thanks, and any and
all help is better than what I have now :)
