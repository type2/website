Kyle, 

I was speaking about five (5) or six (6) years ago when Vanagon_at_lenti
covered ALL busses, including v'gons, splits and bays.

&gt; your reality it means the failure of Western civilization. Of course, how
&gt; silly of me not to have seen it at once. I was reading through all of the
&gt; pithy economic treatise on your site and I of course felt ridiculous for
&gt; having thought that it had anything to do with VW buses.

Nope, Its about VW busses, just has nothing to do with yours. ;) sorry if
I misunderstood your message &amp; you were just kidding.

I am planning on writing essays about this and that, but so far the VW
theme and travel is about all that is there. Even if I do write essays,
VW's will still be the central theme as much of my time with VW's has
shaped a lot of what I think.

Sorry if I overreacted, I look forward to meeting you someday.

take care,

Steve
