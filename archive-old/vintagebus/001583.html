Subject: Safari Windows for your help.

Tonight I tried to make a tool that I could use to compress the valve
springs and attempt to remove the inner spring.  Nothing doing.  I laid
there under the bus for quite sometime wondering just what the hell I'm
doing.  I've devoted my life to getting this bus running and I'm really sick
of it.  It will just be sitting the driveway until it's fixed or sold and I
can't spend anymore money on it for awhile.  In desperation, I offer the
following deal:

If someone in the area would like to use my towbar and tow my bus away
someplace and fix it for me, in exchange you can have my wolfsburg safari
windows - brand new - never been installed.  What you have to do is somehow
remove the inner valves springs and figure out where all my oil is coming
from and you can have the windows.  If you're a good mechanic, this might be
a deal, and if you suck, then probably not.

It's evident to me that the engine will just have to be torn down to the
heads in order for the valve springs to be removed and I'm simply just not
in the mood to do it.  I just want to drive my bus and enjoy it without any
more back breaking labor being put into it.

If you want to work in my driveway and use my tools, stay a night or 2, and
eat courtesy of me, then have at it. I'll help you put the engine on the
stand and take it down but you do the rest.  I can point out what things to
watch for (engine tin maladies) but the rest is your game.  If you work well
and meticulous and solve my oil leak situation, you take home a new set of
safari windows.

I promise to leave you alone if you choose to work here.  At this point, I
don't even want to look at the damn thing.
