&gt;just now i turned the key into the off position and pulled it out, when 
&gt;the engine decided to keep on running. i recently replaced the gen. brushes
&gt;(if that matters), it is all 12v and the fuses seem to be ok.

Did you polarize the generator?  See Bentley or Muir for the procedure.
Probably not your main problem here, though.

&gt;i then choked the engine and all the electrics still remained on (oil and 
&gt;gen light). for now i have disconnected the battery, could this be the
&gt;ignition switch/system?

Very likely.  To tell for sure, disconnect the ignition wire from
terminal 15 on the ignition switch (the black wire) and hook the
battery back up.  Leave the key out of the ignition switch.  If
the oil and generator lights are off, and they come on when you
touch the black wire back on to terminal 15, then your ignition
switch is stuck on.

If, however, the lights come on even with the black wire to #15
disconnected, then there is a short somewhere between #15 and #30
(the always-hot feed from the battery).  It could be lots of
places, but you might start by looking closely at the right end
of your fuse box.  The far right fuse is powered by #30 and
the second-to-the-right is powered by #15.  If any terminals on
these two fuses are shorted together (maybe because of some
melted fuse-box plastic or wire insulation) then you can have
the problem you describe.

Good luck!
