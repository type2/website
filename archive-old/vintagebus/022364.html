Subject: Found some wood slats!
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well I got pretty lucky at the local L*wes (aka &quot;local building supplies
super-center&quot;). They carry 1/2 X 2 X 48 Red Oak slats. I call 'em slats
'cause they are nice finished wood slats that are perfectly smooth with
nice sharp edges. All I'll have to do to use them on the roof rack is cut a
few inches off the length, drill my screw holes, and then finish and/or
clear coat them.

Which brings me to a question. What's the best thing to use to protect the
wood slats from the elements. Some kind of shalak? Or Thompson's? or what?
I'm not sure if I want to stain them or not. They look so nice like they
are. But I definatly want some kind of thick clear on there to help protect
them. What do you reccommend?

These were $3.00 a piece here. That's a bit more than I'd like to have
paid. But since they are pretty much ready to go, and since wood is so high
around here right now anyway, AND since I got the whole rack for free, I
guess that's OK :)
