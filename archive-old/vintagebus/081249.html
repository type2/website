Subject: Quilted Window Covers for Fall/Winter Camping

I mentioned these earlier this year, but thought it worth a quick recap now
that winter is upon us.  I have four sets of these left, but no more coming
after that. The manufacturer has discontinued them for splitties; now
they're only available for later model VW vans.

These European made quilted window covers are are specifically designed for
Splitties.  They attach to the insides of your windows using supplied
suction cups when you are camping in the bus, keeping the interior warm
inside by preventing heat loss through the windows (which is where most of
your interior heat escapes). I'd suppose you could keep some of them up
while driving to keep the van warm in cold weather as well.  Of course, a
side benefit is that they double as &quot;curtains,&quot; giving you privacy by
covering your windows. These are complete sets - a pair for the windshields,
three for each side, and one for the rear hatch window. The exterior is a
brushed-aluminum color (silver but not aluminum-foil bright) with light blue
piping.

Price is $99.95 for the set.
