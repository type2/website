This deluxe was so rusty, the only thing left with any merit was the roof
clip.  I considered it a good save. We also sold some parts on ebay from
this deluxe to help other buses stay on the road.  The bus was so far gone,
that when the roof came off, the front cab fell forwards about 6 to 8 inches
on its own.  Suffice to say, this deluxe was a donor bus through and
through.
