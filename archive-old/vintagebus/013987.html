i am finally getting to my bumpers, i have galvanizer lined up. Yesterday I
took them off, and took them apart. Kind of fun-because every nut and bolt
came off fairly easily, and was easy to access(i must have done something
wrong).

Some questions i have:
On my rear bumper there are two pieces of flat metal between the corners of
the bus and the bumper. These had a gasket/seal between them and the bumper,
what is the possibility of getting new seals? Does anyone know what i am
talking about? The seals are amazingly in pretty good shape, well one is
anyway, the other is all dried up.

Next question on Front bumper side attachments:
The tabs sticking out of the bus, should those pretty much be vertically
aligned, mine are kind of angled towards the back of the bus, i think that is
why my front bumper is so close to the nose. I though I should straighten
these out so that they point and down.

Thanks for any info on this.

i am getting the following galvanized, i'll let you know how they turn out:
bumpers, vw symbol on nose, belly pan, rims...

can you thik of anything else that comes off relatively easily that would be
worth galvanizing?

thanks.
