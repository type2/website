&gt; Hi,
&gt; The problem with using the type 3 tranny is that the wheel bearings are not 
&gt; enough for the bus.  Especially if you plan on loading your bus with cargo or 
&gt; even just people.

okay,

i've heard this before but i have a question.  Arent the bearings exactly
the same as the ones ussed in the bus? (at least 55-63)

And the loads on the bearings in a straight axle configuration will be
less than in a reduction box it would seem to me.  In a reduction box you
have a longer stub axle with a shorter gear sandwiched between two
bearings...  It would seem that the outer bearing would act as a fulcrum
point of sorts, and be subjected to higher loads than a bearing in a
straight axle configuration that is not subject to these additional loads.

rude ascii art...
B=bearing  G=gear F=fulcrum point

bus setup:
  F
BGB----
the upward force on the stub axle (----) is magnified on the bearings as
it is a longer lever and the gear is a shorter lever.  it would seem that
the force would be multiplied by a factor of how much longer the stub axle
is than the width of the bearing.  Since you have upward force on one
bearing and downward force on the other, having two does not appreciably
increase their load carrying capacity. (or does it?? do we have an
engineer in the house?)

t3 setup:
            F
============B----
in this setup the stub axle is shorter than the distance between the
bearing and the fulcrum point, thus the force is divided rather than
multiplied.  I am by far no engineer, this is just a guess and any and all
input is appreciated...

any opinions?

peas,

Steve
