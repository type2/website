&lt;&lt; any ideas (ie tips, tricks) on how to get the old reserve cable out of my 
59 23 window?  The inner cable is rusted inside the housing, and the outer is 
stuck inside the conduit that runs underneath the bus between the belly pan 
and the floor. &gt;&gt;
Hi Doug,
First go under the bus with goggles on.  There use a piece of 2x4&quot; to rap 
both sides of the cable tube the full length.  This hopefully will jar loose 
the rust locking it in place.  
  If the above does not do the trick you are going to have to park the bus 
with it's nose uphill and/or with the front end up on jackstands.  Then pour 
some sort of acid (Phospheric, Muteric, Hydrochloric or other.) to remove the 
rust inside the tube over several days or even weeks untill the cable loosens 
up.  You might be able to make a sort of funnel around the forward end of the 
tube out of some sort of puddy lined on the inside with a plastic wrap 
material to keep the puddy from reacting to the acid.  Also make sure to 
place a plastic bucket/pan under the rear end of the tube to catch the acid 
coming out, and maybe allowing you to reuse it.  Eric&amp;Barb
