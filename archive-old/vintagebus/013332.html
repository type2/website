Now that all the VW festivities are over Germany is a bit more boring.   I am sitting in a Cafe in some tiny town in Germany at the moment.  Any German locals want to meet a list member and suggest someplace to do something?  (This keyboard is driving me nuts... the z is where the y should be and all the punctuation is somewhere else).  Bad Camberg was cool, but I am sure someone else has already said that.

Hez Ronnie, if you can, let me know what size ball is on those hitches (call Kyle?) so I can buy the trailer part.

Everett, I found some interesting barndoor stuff.  I tried to get doubles of things you might need.  Wish I had a digital camera so I could send pictures for the web page.

It looks like the list has been busy since I left.  It took me an hour to get my messages moved to a folder so I would have enough memory to actually load and read them.

Now for the required bus content...  Well, I don't have any questions other than wanting to know the part number for the Barndoor rear reflectors.  

I did see something cool at the transporter factory today (the tour was in German so I missed most of the info).  One of the old photos showed a guy putting a part on a door on a 61 bus.  He was wearing sandels.  Kind of weird... no steel toes or anything.  Heck, I guess I was wearing the same when they let us walk all around the machinery today.  One guy was unloading body panels with one hand and smoking with the other.  Different world.  Anyone have a site with a translation for german trafic signs?  The VW Polo I rented got towed last night and I donät't want it to happen again.  Sorry for the long content but I am really bored.

Richard
