&gt; these have been around for over a year now and is all that's available for
&gt; the time being. Being the public's dislike for change I have been told that

Wheels are better than dragging.
A refrigerator is better than an icehouse.
Indoor plumbing... nuff said.
Solid state switching whoops butt on mechanical contacts for reliability
and long life.
