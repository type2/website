1. OG safaris with the so called double walled frames are made from 1 piece
of steel rolled in a multi stage process theat creates the inner channel.
That is the reason no repop Safaris have this. To expensive to make the
tooling. That is amother reason why Dave at CE uses tempered glass instead
of laminated. He has found that with the laminated glass the repop frames
(everyones) flex to much thus cracking the laminated glass. he feels the
tempered can take more flex.

2. I had discussed with Dave (CE) about the addition of a second channel in
the repop frames to strenghten them and again, it comes down to cost. He
would have to charge a lot more for them then he already does.

3.  Only his inner seals can be used, no other aftermarket seals will work
right.

4. He has made one improvement to the frames in the last week where as the
hinge in now spot welded on instead of hand welded on.

5.  If anyone wold like to know more on the whys and ways of CE Safaris
please call or p-mail me or Dave at CE direct.

&lt;&lt; That's what I would have said, but you'll have to plug weld them in.  I 
don't
 think you could get the tongs inside the channel with a conventional spot
 welder.  Drill evenly spaced holes on the exterior frame and then clamp the
 mocked up frame inside the exterior frame and plug weld away.  Seems like
it
 would work.

argh. That's what i meant. I just don't know the actual welding terms. Well
I 
guess ill go measure someones OG safaris for the depth and such and have a 
buddy give it a try.

Thanks!
