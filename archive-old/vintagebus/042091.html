&gt; &gt; Where is the logic here? You wouldnt do it the correct way with a part
&gt; &gt; designed for just such a purpose but you would advise a kludge as a better

&gt; I think he meant he wouldn't remove the electromagnetic cut-off. He added
&gt; that there was no need to buy a part to do it, just cut the plunger off,
&gt; which I have seen done a million times. It appeared to me that he thought a
&gt; better solution was to leave it alone.

Ahhhh....that makes sense.
I cant remember what the original question was now maybe it helped make
me think that.
