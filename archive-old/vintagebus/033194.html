Subject: emergency flashers
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

To get my bus streetable i need to get my emergency lights working  ( CA 
brake and light inspection ).  i foung that the wire going to the turn signal 
switch was cut, but when i reconnect the wire only the switch bulb on the 
dash lights up. the switch is also connected to the S-  on the flasher relay 
box, and i can hear the box switching on and off. 
help!! this is the last step to reviving this vintage metal.
