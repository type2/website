Since we seem to have a thread going for heaters once again... I have been 
tinkering with an electrical schematic for an early (up to August 1969) 
heater and &quot;colorizing&quot; the wires and cleaning it up to my liking since, as 
Thom so aptly put earlier, it is quiet.  This drawing has a second schematic 
on the same page for a post August 1969 BN4 heater.  I pulled it down from 
&quot;http://w1.111.telia_dot_com/~111-7929/BN4_schema_en.gif&quot;.

The question, I guess, is whether someone wants this ?  Rick?  Thom, you 
have a spot for it?  I also have a cleaned up cross section drawing of a BN4 
I have been puttering with off and on that I can push out to someone or a 
central location (preferable I would think).  Perhaps on the documentation 
project somewhere?  Both of these drawings have been preset to 11x17 size if 
anyone is curious about that.
