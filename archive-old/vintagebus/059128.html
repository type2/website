Subject: RE: [VB] My wiper blades suck

If they last two years I think that is acceptable.  Sounds like they
might.  Even that hurts a lot when you pay $20 for one.  $12 sounds better
than $20 and I just want to see through the rain.  Not that it would ever
rain here.

&gt; I would have to take them off the make them last. The repops I sell (12
&gt; dollars a piece) I wish I could buy them cheaper but the guy that makes them
&gt; kinda gouges these being he is the only one making them (his bug blades are
&gt; half as much), seem to last longer but I don't know how long. I know of a
&gt; couple people that have had them on there buses since I started selling them
&gt; 18 months ago and they are still holding up
