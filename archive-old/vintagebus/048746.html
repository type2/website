Subject: should I pull my disty?

I just went out today and tried to fire my recently re-assembled 
engine again. Before i did anything else, i flipped the disty cap 180 
degrees. I tried to start the engine and it actually kinda got 
started for a very few seconds before it died. But it sounded way 
&quot;off&quot;. By that i mean way out of time or something. I flipped the 
disty cap back around the &quot;correct&quot; way and tried to start with no 
luck. I then decided to check the timing. Now my timing is way off. I 
set it correct with the disty cap in the right place. no go on a 
start.

Is it possible my distributor is no good or going bad or something? I 
hate to have to change out another component and still have my 
problem. I've got one in an old engine in the barn I could try. Or I 
could wait and buy a new. I just want to get my engine going.

I'll look at idiot book about changing the disty.

Another frustration I'm running into is I've got an electric fuel 
pump which continues to pump fuel into the carb as I do timing or 
whatever. Causes a nice flooded engine. May be part of the problem as 
well.

It just seems like I spent a lot of time making sure I had everything 
lined up right. I know I've got the cam and crank lined up right. MAY 
have missed the disty drive gear....but I dont' think so.

Fishing for answers......
