Subject: Fw: Big nut rear axle seal question

I took my rear axle seals at the RGB's apart recently because the drivers side
was leaking. I got some rebuild kits and put them in. After I put it back
together, the spacer that the drum contacts on the passenger side was out too
far by a couple of mm's. I went on and torqued the nuts down and let it sit
for a week or so.

When I checked it the other day, the passenger side was leaking. I took that
side apart and the small black rubber oil seal that goes between the spacer
and the roller bearing was completely crushed flat and destroyed. I looked at
the big oil seal that goes around the spacer and it looks fine, not cocked
sideways and is seated all the way into the housing.

I'm stumped. Anybody got any ideas what my problem is?
