Subject: Re: [VB] valve clearance

Hey Stan, I suspect your &quot;hot cam&quot; whatever that grind is, is your reason
for the dead spot. Generally, the valve clearance, unless under .004,
will
have no effect on hesitation. 
 
You are right about the bug DP engines getting the looser valve clearance
on
the California carbureted models, then in 74 with all fuel injected. I
still
have no problems with .006, since the CA pollution requirements are the
least of my worries.
--------------------------- Clip ---------------------
This DP has dual port heads, dual carbs, extractor exhaust and bunches of
FuFu.
Although I've had many VWs, 57, 63 bug, 72 Beatles and bunches of TypeIVs
in Vanagons, I'm still trying to sort this 66 Splittie out that has the
late engine, drive etc.
I have never named any vehicle I've had but this one is qualifying for
&quot;666 Bus&quot; as a name.

Stan
