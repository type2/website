Hi Ken,
You are welcome!
The corrosion we were mostly reffering to occurs when two differant metals 
are put together and create a galvanic reaction.  In otherwords they create a 
battery and voltage which causes corrosion!  As in iron piston rings in 
aluminum piston grooves!  This corrosion takes more room that previously 
allowed the parts to move about and sticks them together instead.    Eric&amp;Barb
