 How about dropping them in bleach? I tried that on my knobs and they seem to still look OK. Oh yeah Denis you bought those knobs from my swap meet space.. I was the guy on the minibike (black w/flames)
  Now that I have my rare original radio knobs for my '63, 
I need to paint =
them. They are badly discolored and stained. I know that 
the wrong paint =
will desolve the wierd protoplastic, so my question 
is...what kind of =
paint should I use to make them white?





Thanks,

Brian
