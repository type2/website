Hi Kris,
You are welcome.  The main thing is to keep down the rust problems in our
steel friends.  We have been able to find a high zinc content primer at NAPA
stores and get a 10% discount by ordering by the case.  The only problem with
this paint is it settles very quickly if left unmoved in the cans.  We pull
out spray cans days before using them, shake and turn over a couple of times a
day.  Tried this primer here in the wet NW of USA on several places on our
panel van.  Just quickly sanded down some rust spots and zinc primered.  Two
years later the rust just started to make it's way through the single coat of
zinc primer.  With all of those rocks dancing around under our VWs, zinc
primer is the way to go.  Eric &amp; Barb
