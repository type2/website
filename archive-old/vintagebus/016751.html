That's *exactly* why!  There's a gazillion '54 BD deluxes, and it's 
almost impossible to tell them apart!   If mine was a nice original-paint
bus, I wouldn't dream of it, but since better than 30% of the car is either
repro, fabbed, or NOS pieces, why not?

Of course, paint is so far distant for this bus...
