I'm probably jumping in late here, the light is not the oil light right?
If it is and I'm insulting your intelligence I apologize. My bus had the
same problem, I cleaned every electrical
connection I could find from the engine compartment to the front of the
bus , all the lights
etc. The problem pretty much went away, but I still had a faint glow, it
was really only noticable at night. The idiot book said this was to some
extent normal, so I didn't worry too much about it. I never had any
negative effects from it. I forgot to mention my bus was in good tune
with a new belt. Makes you go hummn.
