The bus rolled into a ditch that slowed it down. It was about 10ft wide and 
and 3ft deep. It was a V-shape that went down, then right back up. The bus 
almost missed the pole. It hit just below the hinge on the pass. side, it 
left a VERY SMALL dent, and then a scrape from the nose just rt. of the 
hinge, to the door, just below the hinge. I tied the back of the bus with 3 
small straps to keep it from rolling forward. These were tied to holes on the 
inside of the engine compartment, and hooked to the side of the trailer. The 
third was tied to the back of the trailer. My friend who was driving used a 
big 6000 lb test pulley strap with big hooks to keep it from rolling back. It 
was very long, so he hooked one side to the front, then wrapped it around the 
back of the bus from underneath, by the back tires, then went back to the 
front of the trailer and hooked it there. The strap was a 3 in. wide thick, 
nylon strap. It had to have been rubbing on a flat piece of metal though, 
because it had a clean cut where it had broken. When the bus was on the side 
of the road, it still had al three straps I had put on it attached to the 
rear. When we retied it, we spent a long time, and used 2 of the straps to 
tie it from the rear of the bus to the side gates, this kept it from rolling 
forward, back, or sideways. We also used the big strap again with a big knot 
and wrapped it around the ROUND axle up front. The trucker who helped us get 
it on the trailer tied it for us and showed us how, after that, it did not 
budge an inch.
