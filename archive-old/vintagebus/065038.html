&gt; says trailors have to be in the right lane only. Should I pay or fight it?

Here it is from the horse's mouth:

Short version is that the cop is right unless the highway is 4 lanes going
in your direction.  If there were 4 or more lanes you could be in either
of the two rightmost lanes.

Unless you really want your blood pressure to rise, go ahead and pay it.
If you decide to fight it you will have to drive all the way back, tell
your story, have the cop tell his story, and be found guilty.  The only
way you will win is if the cop either doesn't show up (that happens a lot
for offenses where the fine would be less than the officer's
earning potential on the road) or if the cop made an error on the ticket
(cited wrong vehicle code section, etc.)
