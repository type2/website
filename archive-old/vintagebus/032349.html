There is a company in Jerome, AZ that sells kits for converting vehicles to 
electric.  My partner and I do a lot of the machining for them.  I know 
they sell VW kits because we are running production right now on a bunch of 
VW bell housings ( nice machined castings) and motor/flywheel 
adapters.  You can purchase everything you need, or bits and pieces, if you 
already have a motor, etc...  Bell housings are available for an assortment 
of electric motors.

Search &quot;Wilde EVolutions&quot; on the web, and check out info and online catalog.
