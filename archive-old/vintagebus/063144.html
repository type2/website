Subject: RE: [VB] Jack point repair

Hi All,
Costco has a terrific floor jack for $69.95.  Way cool to jack up the real
of a type I high enough to remove the engine.  It's heavy enough to take 2
guys to lift it into a truck or your bus.

No Costco in your area?  I think they have and sell via a website as well.

If you are near LA, the Pomona Auto Swap Meet has deals on jacks, and also
Harbor Freight Outlet has heavy duty jacks for pretty good prices as well.

Even EBARF.

Ed
