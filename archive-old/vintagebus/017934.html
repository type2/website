Hey Phil,

Take a peek at www.sv2s_dot_com to get the scoop on Strictly Vintage 2s. 
I think we have a pretty good rep, and I know we have a couple of 
members in Texas. Although, I know it's a big state, so they might be 
a couple of miles from you. We are beefing up our online presence 
everyday and soon will have virtual meetings online.

Let me know what you think!

Scott
