&gt; Also noticed that my case has the notation &quot;WB&quot; stamped in it on the
&gt; rear vertical surface between the distributor and fuel pump holes.
&gt; The letters are half the height of the engine number - they look
&gt; like those standard machine-shop letter punch sets.  I wonder if these
&gt; are the initials of the person or shop that rebuilt it?  The lady
&gt; I bought the bus from bought it in the Bay Area about 10 years ago.

Cool!  The case from my 1974 Super Beetle Sun Bug has this too!  I've
wondered what this is all about as the Bug originally came through
California, then was sold to someone in Nevada, Columbus, NE, Beatrice, NE
and then to me.  Tom Petersen of Albequerque, NM now owns it.  Anyway, the
case is currently getting the bores opened up for 90.5's at my machinist's
shop.  I thought it might be a factory stamp of some sort but now I'm more
inclined to believe that some shop in the area stamped all engines they ever
worked on.

Anyone else know the story behind this?  I really doubt that Warner Bros.
had a part in this. :-)
