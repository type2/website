&gt; ... I used a Brazilian PICT30/31-3 Brosol with the

&gt;  the get-go with a .009 distributor.
&gt;  It started, idled, and ran fine out of the box  Good drivability.
&gt;  The 34PICT flat spot is still there, but considerably reduced.
&gt;  OTOH, I notice that the engine has a greater flattening of power at high
&gt;  RPM than the old engine and 34PICT-3 that it replaced.  This is
&gt;  particularly noticable when climbing hills.  Situations where I used to
&gt;  hold 40MPH (actual) at partial throttle in third are now 37MPH (actual) at
&gt;  WOT.

&gt; Using an H30/31 carburetor on a dual port engine has produced a noticeable
&gt;  drop in hill climbing power for me.  I switched back to a 34pict3 and felt
&gt;  better going up hill with the pedal on the floor.  This was on a bug, but
&gt;  I climbed a big hill every day with it at freeway speeds.  The 30/31 carbs
&gt;  don't flow as much as a 34pict3.  If running dual port heads use a
&gt;  34pict3.  If running single ports use 30/31 in general. 

What about the power circuit in the 30 pict-2?  This carb was made for 1600 
engines, albeit SP's.  The power circuit is supposed to compensate during 
WOT. Sounds like folks are not happy with the 30 pict-1 on DP's.  I think I 
am going to have a 30 pict-2 rebuilt to give it a try.
