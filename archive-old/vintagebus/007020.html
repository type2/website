Just about every VW parts store and mail order house has new heads. There
are 3 different head manufacturers (that I know of) from Brazil and 2 from
Mexico. Just make sure you are getting the good ones, ask your sales person
they should know, don't go by price, it could hurt you in the long run.

There was some outfit offering brand new Brazilian/German heads for 1600 DP
engines. I believe I placed order but forgot all about it. Does anybody
remember who that was?

Thanks,

Andre
