Either they said something stupid or a
misunderstanding occurred.  A welded joint will
withstand as much or more heat than the base
material.  No way would a welded joint would melt,
however, a BRAZED joint however might.

A really quick primer on metal joining:

Soldering: no base material melting, low temperature
process, tin/lead type material, wiring soldered,
can be loose fitting parts.

Brazing: no base metal melting, high temperature
alloy such as brass, copper, bronze used to join
metal parts, needs tight fitting parts.

Welding: base metal melted, very high temperature,
similar metal melted with base metal, can be loose
fitting parts with weld metal joining them.
