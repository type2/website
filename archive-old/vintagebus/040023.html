I'm sorry but that is nuts... I'm not as hard core as most of you guys on 
this list but I'm trying and that is crazy!  $146 is something like 
2-hours... I have changed out all the slaves in a 68 bug and bled the system 
in about that time.  A better way to put it, Ronnie, is that your prices as 
fair.  If it was LA, well, that says it all.. kinda like the SF Bay Area 
except for climate.  Oh well...

&gt;I just got the shock of my life. A very good friend took his 64 delux in 
&gt;for
&gt;brakes and over $1000.00 dollars later, the highly recommended VW expert
&gt;shop, put the screws to him, or else my prices are way to cheap. What he 
&gt;got
&gt;was a NEW 67 only master, front wheel cylinders (varga) rear wheel 
&gt;cylinders
&gt;(varga) and rear shoes. No hoses, seals, front shoes, turned drums etc and
&gt;labor all this was done in the L A&lt; CAL area. I won't mention the shop's
&gt;name to protect the innocent, but boy did that hurt. The thing is did he
&gt;need all this, everything was new 3 years ago!
&gt;
&gt;ronnie  ( glad I do my own work)  volks home
&gt;
&gt;PS; he said the labor prices were straight out of their computer software
&gt;program, something like 146 dollars per wheel to change cylinders and they
&gt;gave him a discount!!!.
