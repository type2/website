Subject: Re: [VB] Wide engine tidbits...help

George,

Ooops.  That .006 I wrote should have been .060!  I meant to have said I
shimmed the cylinders 60 thousandths...not 6 ten thousandths!  The engine is
.120 wider.  Not much, but that is the only thing I can think of for the tin
miss fit.  In all other respects the cylinder cover tin fits like it
should.  Tight against the exhaust ports and the attachment screw hole
around the intake hole are in the proper spot.

BTW I'm using a German exhaust and it still fits...even with the wider
engine.

Steve

&gt; &gt; &gt;Well, it looks like more and more things are unexpectedly (at least by
&gt; &gt; &gt;this novice engine builder) being affected by me shimming my cylinders
&gt; &gt; &gt;to get my CR correct.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Anything else I should look out for??  I've GOT to get this truck
&gt; &gt; &gt;running.  The clock is really ticking.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Steve,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Two things come to mind.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; #1 You may now have issues with a stock exhuast lining up correctly.
&gt;
&gt; .006 per side means that the engine is about .012 wider now.  That is not
&gt; all that much, less than half the tinyest (1/32) divisions on my trust
&gt; tape measure.  The normal tolerances designed into the tin and the
&gt; exhaust system should be enough to handle this.
&gt;
&gt; If there is a problem with holes not lining up, look beyond the shimming
&gt; for the answer.  For example, Mexican mufflers don't seem to fit on
&gt; anything!  I have no idea what they use for a jig, but it doesn't have
&gt; much to do with a VW engine!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; #2 You may need to shim you rockers due to changing geometry
&gt; &gt; resulting from shimming the heads. If you shim the heads.
&gt;
&gt; If anything, you would have to machine the standoffs to get the rockers
&gt; closer to the head to maintain geometry.  Another solution is to use
&gt; pushrods that are .006 longer on each side.
&gt;
&gt; The real-world solution is not to worry about it.  The difference that
&gt; .006 inches in cylinder length will make on the rocker geometry is tiny.
