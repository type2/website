&lt;&lt; WTF is transmission grease?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
We have never been able to figure out which type of grease they are referring 
to.  You might just want to use tranny oil instead.  Grease has more of a 
tendancy to suspend the metal dust up, and around the worm gear to wear it 
out faster.  Plus grease would be more inclined to freeze up in cold weather 
due to the low RPMs experienced in the steering box not warming it up.  Check 
with Jack Maynard who has a receipe for a thickener of the tranny oil so it 
does not tend to seep out of the steering box around the output shaft seal.
