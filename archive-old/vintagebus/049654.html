Subject: Re: [VB] valve keepers and wear


G Lyle:

&gt;&gt;Well, the only thing that would allow the keeper to lose tension and move
&gt;&gt;is the spring going loose some time while operating.

Yeah, we were recalling Berg's comments that he sends his rejects back for
the others to sell - he may have had a point!  We are positing either a
metal problem (valve or keeper is made of a softer metal alloy than normal)
or a bad spring, but a higher ratio of bad sproings recently.
My friend has built vw motors for 30 years, and asked me to query the List
on this, as it is a recent problem he's encountered....
