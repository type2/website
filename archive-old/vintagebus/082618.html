That's exactly what I did back in the resto. My tubes  (pipes) were new
along with the repro verticals; my blade is original 67. I filled the
pipes up with metal-ready (POR), then rinsed them out and dried them, then
filled the pipes with POR15, shook'em for a bit, then poured it out, and
used it to coat the inside surfaces of the verticals and the blades,
already prepped.

Lots of rain in the last ten years, no rust, at all. Bumpers look new.

&gt; Actually - someone did respond directly - I decided against the repro
&gt; stuff - the problem with my og overriders was that they are rusty inside and
&gt; when they were painted and stuff before they kept rusting in the tubes and
&gt; rust ran down onto the blades. I figure what I'll try is cleaning out the
&gt; tubes with a wire brush - maybe rinse em with lacquer thinner then use the
&gt; por-15 products - then por-15 inside with ... maybe just a rag on a
&gt; coat-hanger or something.  I'll por all of the parts in the inside - then
&gt; put em together - then prime and paint.
