Subject: Re: [VB] Buses and Balloons

My info came from VW's Progressive Refinements.  Model year concept started
in '55 for the beetle wouldn't think they would wait four more years to do
it with the busses.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Body number 272409 (Behind front seat, passenger side) is
&gt; &gt;October of '57 production.  Chassis number 272409 (Engine
&gt; &gt;compartment) is August of '57 production.
&gt;
&gt; Chassis numbers and dates from Doliwa:
&gt;
&gt; 272 301  12 July 1957
&gt; 281 900  2 September 1957
&gt;
&gt; So it looks like it could have been closer to mid-July.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Either way it is a '58 model year so I think it should have
&gt; &gt;the larger round tail lights.
&gt;
&gt; Are you sure?  I think this Bus predates the idea of &quot;model year&quot;
&gt; a little bit.  The info I have says that they started counting
&gt; &quot;model years&quot; with the '59 model year on 1 November 1958.  I
&gt; think this Bus might qualify as a '57.
&gt;
&gt; On the tail lights, Doliwa says 5 April 1957 at chassis 246 964 for
&gt; the two brake lights instead of the center one.  Bus Trivia: At the
&gt; same date, the angle of incidence for the license plate lamp was
&gt; changed to 8 degrees.  Remind me to bring a protractor to the next
&gt; show.  :)
