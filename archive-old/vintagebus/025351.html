I just took mine apart last week and it was abreeze.If you have access
to an oxy-acetylene torch you can make short work of it by heating the
coupler cherry red and attaching a vice-grip to both ends rear shift
coupler end and front shift rod(F is F) and hit the foreward vice-grip
with a hammer and all SHOULD come apart.Only took about ten minutes and
I was ready to drop the axel.Make sure you follow general safety and
common sense rules as well as take out th front seat and empty the under
seat storage area and tire well and put in some wet rags to soak up the
heat on a bench model,on a walk thru take up the rubber mat between the
seats.

&gt; Ok, what's the magic technique to separate the shift rod that's just aft
&gt; of the  front axle? I drilled out the previously-broken bolt, used a
&gt; little penetrant, a little heat and a few choice words, but the rods
&gt; won't separate.
&gt; 
&gt; I've also tried twisting with a pair of vise grips, that didn't work out
&gt; either.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm considering marking and cutting the rod in two (I need to take out
&gt; the beam) then welding it back in again. Will the rod being shortened
&gt; the width of the hacksaw blade affect the shifting after it's all welded
&gt; back up?
&gt; 
&gt; Just looking for feedback before I perform any half-_at__at_sed repairs on my
&gt; bus.
