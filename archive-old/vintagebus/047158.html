&lt;&lt; Mercedes made this bus-looking thing.  It used the exact same headlights.
 I can't recall the model of this puppy, but it came in several different 
 configurations.  I know of one in Sacramento that's like the &quot;deluxe&quot; 
 version, complete with &quot;corner windows&quot; &gt;&gt;
There is a van in town here that looks like a bay window 23(oops, 22) window. 
the guy wouldnt let me any where near it, but said it was a goliath. Dont 
know if that was manufacturer or model name.
