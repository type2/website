Howdy,
   Just purchased a 79 transporter and have yet to get an owners manual. In
the interim, can anyone tell me the functions of the 3 heater controls? 2
red sliders and the third a blue job. They all slide freely but don't
change anything. Also while looking under the bus I noticed the heater
accordian ducts in place (heater boxes to chassis) but what also appears to
be an additional set of round holes that &quot;look&quot; like they should have a set
of accordians as well. I am getting cold air thru my defroster vents.
Thanks in advance,
Gary
