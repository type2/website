Subject: Bosch rev limiting rotors available.

I've just been informed by &quot;Gordon&quot; (my contact) that he will be sending me
some Bosch rev limiting rotors for buses. I believe these are the 4500 rpm
cutoff ones.  I've already received one and despite it looking like it sat
on a shelf a long time, it's never been used and is representative of the
condition of the rest of them.  There are about 20 of them I'm receiving and
we are making them available to the list.  Currently, we don't have a price
set yet but if this sounds like something you are wanting, please email me
and I'll let you know more info as I receive it.
