It's nice to see that the people on the East have as much fun as we do at
the bus shows, Wait till we all get together out here, Jerome? Buses by the
Bridge V. Can't wait to see NG and VW Howard together, hot laps around the
fire pit!

Heck that ain't nothing. Wait unti everyone sees the pic of you 3
wearing those black leather thongs! Now thats a kodak moment.

Ahem Shawn - we had an agreement remember?  You wouldn't talk about the
black thongs if I wouldn't tell everyone about the matching set of his and
hers Captain America G-Strings that you and Sarah paraded around the
campsite in.  Let's keep things quiet shall we? :-)
