I'm trying to separate the axles from my 66 big nut transmission. The books
say to remove a large circlip. Is this underneath the so-called daisy? Do the 
Reduction Boxes have to come all apart first or can I remove them and the 
axle whole?

read in the bentley reprint or some such manual how to take the axles apart.
Yes, you do need to take the boxes apart before you can take the axle tubes
and axles off the center section.
