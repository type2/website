Subject: Re: [VB] Strange electrical problem

I knew a guy had a bus that you had to turn the headlights on halfway, do  
something else, then turn the key to start the bus.
 
normally the hot wire from the fuse box comes up to the 30 terminal on the  
headlight switch, then jumps to the ig switch to give power to the ig  switch.  
If it comes off the ig switch at a different terminal, you would  have to 
turn the headlights on.   
 
Off hand I don't know what up with the brakes.. sound like it only runs  when 
the brakes are on?   that must be hard to drive... some thing is  hooked up 
wrong...   Coloured wiring diagrams at vintagebus_dot_com... do  you have one 
printed out?  
 
Who did the wiring?  
do they have a colour wiring diagram printed out?

Hi,

My 64DD has a new wire harness. Via the ignition switch, the  engine will not
shut off if the headlights are on and the brake pedal is  depressed. As soon
as I lift my foot off the pedal the engine will stop.  Any suggestions as to
where to look for the  problem?

Thanks,
Chris.

PS. I did not install the harness  myself. Was done by the guys that did  the
restoration.
