&gt;There was one on ebay a couple days ago, Bosch, I believe.  I think
&gt;it was a list lurker who was selling it.  He's in the NL


I saw that one, but it was an unknown quantity to me.  It was supposed to
have come off a European dealer's shelves.  The instructions might not have
been in English.  I want something pretty standard (like a Radio Shack
unit), 'cause I might need to wire two or three of them together to provide
enough power for a modern stereo with four built in amps and a CD player.

I'm wary of having enough amps because I installed a Blaupunkt Key West
($145 on Ebay, new in box) in my Beetle, and the thing cuts out if I'm
playing a CD w/ the headlights on and apply the brakes.  I'm going to
upgrade to a 54A alternator and see if it helps.  It only has a 30A
alternator now.
