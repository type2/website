Subject: Re: [VB] How to mask for 2 tone paint
Message-ID: &lt;383D8A80.BC1D709_at_vbe_dot_com&gt;

&gt; use the
&gt; 3m stuff, not the bargain basement crap

and make sure you use the cream color masking tape.  The widest you can get.
Put on 4 or so strips on top of one another as to stack it up like
bricks...because that paint goes all over.  I am now doing this since my first
swipe was with only 2 strips.  its a slight overspray..barely noticeable..but
I'm trying to do the best I can.

DON'T buy that crappy brown paint masking tape that 3M sells.  Its sticky on
half of the tape and doesn't stick worth a hoot.  A waste of $4.
