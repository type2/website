If I knew how to post to a site (trying to learn) I would have pics up of
what I have done so far.

Thanks for all the responses on the T4 tranny into a vintagebus. There 
seems to be others who have at least looked into this before. Glad everyone 
has shared the info with me. If I end up doing this project in the future, 
I'll definatly post the whole thing on my site like I've done with 
everything else.
