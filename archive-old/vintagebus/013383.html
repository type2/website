&gt; I dunno, Thom - you talking about a &quot;privy&quot; style tent? 
&gt; http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/pitch/p_erect.html shows the
&gt; &quot;incorrect&quot; method you refer to and AFAIK it's from factory lit.  Would
&gt; love to know how if otherwise.

What I was doing was jamming the pole in the hole (hehe) that the
bolt to hold the bumper in the side of the bus goes.  This caused
the bumper end to bow downwards from the weight of the tent.  Since
I don't have the original rear bumper, I don't know how it's supposed
to be done.  Of course it hadn't occurred to me to check out the
ones I'd seen so far...
