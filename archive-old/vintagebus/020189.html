I found RECMAR.

They do not deal with the public directly, but they
sent me a catalog today. When I get it, I will match
the right product to my (69 Westy) ccurtain rails in
the cab and I'll post the product serial number to the
list as well as a list of places to get it. I'll also
scan in a pic from the catalog, since no website I've
found has a pic.

Hope this helps, it will be about a week, hold tight.
