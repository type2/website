Yall may remember one particular Bus, '61, I was
inquiring about that was found here in Ft Worth… It
was the one that had the funky pop-top made of all
aluminum. &quot;Travel Equipment Corp, New York, N.Y.&quot; was
the conversion company. Original engine (was told it
was), straight as an arrow, zero rust, zero.  It
wasn't for sale, he wanted to trade for a street rail
only, for a parts runner for his shop. Went by there
Saturday to keep up with him (needed a steering box
for the B*g too) Well he has managed to pull the
engine &amp; sell it, &quot;Gonna put a big DP in there, after
we install a new wiring harness &amp; change it over to
12V&quot;. Now its got some funky Porsch* rims on it with
tires that look 1 ½&quot; tall.   Oh well… It aint mine,
but it still hurts…
 OK, on to the question… Same said person has a 64
bus, well sorta. WARNING, this gets pretty gory &amp;
graphic. This bus has a few dings, nothing serious &amp;
Im not a body man. It is a walk thru, but it has no
roof. None, some idiot  took a sawz-all to the
complete top, above the windshields down to the bottom
of the door glass all the way around to the back. Now
heres the Question.. Does any one know where I could
score a Panel Bus top? It looks like it would be a lot
easier to install than a 13 window or camper top. Has
anyone ever had to reinstall the top that some one has
cut off? It doesn't look that hard, like I said, Im no
bodyman, but as far as welding, cutting, &amp;
fabricating, its no prob.  With no windows we wouldn't
have a problem with the channels not lining up, the
only real worry would be the doors &amp; rear hatch.
Sorry bout the bandwidth… but if the top is gonna be
impossible to get were going to throw it in the crazy
idea file and move on.
Later,
