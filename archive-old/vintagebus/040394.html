Hi Volks, had something weird happen that I thought I should mention.
Started my pre-vacation maintenance on my '71 w/ 1600 DP and when I looked
at my engine, it was covered with an oily mist. No drops or anything, just
an oily mist over everything. Couldn't find a leak anywhere. Drained my oil
and when I went to refill it I found that the cork gasket in the oil filler
cap had lost about 1/4 of its cork. Found small bits of cork in the oil I
wiped from the strainer. I have a full-flow filter so, my question is,
should I worry about the bits and pieces that were in there? Any
suggestions????? TBear
