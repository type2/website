Subject: Stock muffer on 1776?

Hi,

Any thoughts from anyone else on using a stock muffler on a 1776 engine?
Sounds like it may be a bit too small. I tend to run a little fast on the
highways. Don't want too much back pressure. The point of all this is that I
want something a good deal quieter and keep the header look.  What about a
toyota or or other muffler from about a 1800 to 2000cc engine? I already
went to a muffler shop and they said they could not fit any of their
mufflers onto the headers. Something about the mufflers being too wide and
too tall. Length did not seem to be so much an issue.  Maybe I just need to
try another shop??

Chris
