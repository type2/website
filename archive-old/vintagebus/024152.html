I am very retentive when it comes to putting things in correctly.  I found 
the correct original plates (after 10 years of looking) for my original 
safaris and even have all original screws.  I also have friends that want to 
put their safaris in correctly, so Kelly Brown aka: metwiz2_at_aol_dot_com   has 
reproduced these plates and may have them for sale soon.  I am told they are 
an exact copy of my originals.  The original plates are not flat, they have a 
very slight rise to them where the screw threads into them.  The bus must 
also have a slot cut into the body to slip these plates into place.  Not an 
easy install if the bus has been painted already.

&gt;How did you insert the original screw plate to mount the Safaris in
&gt;your buses???? I would bet that 95% of you don't even know about this
&gt;moveable plate that mounts the windows, you  just drill and screw, right!
