Subject: Drivers (door) Wanted. Also floor metal.
To: rexrogers_at_type2guy_dot_com, BetsVirg_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My 66 is finally starting to shape up. If one of you folks have a driver's 
door in good shape for sale, I'd sure like to buy it. I also need some 
original floor material if anyone has some laying about.

Thanx,

Bill
