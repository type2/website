Steve, thanks so much for trying to work this out, and not just  going home
with your toys.
The archives are important, and I have a (bad) feeling we are breaking new
intellectual property grounds here, so it is important that we all keep
talking to each other.
Is there a way to work it so those folks who do NOT want their stuff in an
archive can opt out upon signing up to the Lists? IE, all posts from their
addy get sent to a mailbox that is NOT added to the archives upon update?
Would a simple automatic amendment to EACH mesage sent from the server
saying &quot;All contents of this message copyright the author&quot; do it?



I have, in the past, asked Ken, Thom and others if it would be possible to
grab say, the Type2_dot_com Library in a single chunk to have on my harddrive
as a reference... they have usually demurred, again citing potential
problems - though nothing stops me from taking EACH page in my own time and
reconstructing it. Having all that info without having to dial in would be
nice.... but the List and website as an ONGOING concern is nicer.



We have two communities here: the 'free exchange of info' folks, and the
'what I write is mine' folks, just like the real world. It would be nice if
we do a better job hashing this issue out than the current politico/legal
system is
doing.................................................................

Perhaps whatever solution we come up with can encompass ALL our info...
EVEN if it means, NO, you may not distribute/download in entirety/whatever.
EVEN if it means we simply agree to disagree.
