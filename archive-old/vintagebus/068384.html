&gt; rather quickly, thanks for the advice from the group on using a flat,

&gt; 17mm and ONLY $7.99!!) on that upper left nut.  (I had it back on in less
&gt; than 10 seconds!! Thanks Cal)

Yer welcome (bows shyly)! (in the mid-90s, they did make the 17/19mm one
that's in my toolbox - times change!)
