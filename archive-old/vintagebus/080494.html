Subject: Re: [VB] correct height 15 inch modern tires

I have 205 75 15s on my 61 with the flat wheel wells.   The rear ones just 
squeak in when the drums are swung down and in, I wiggle the wheel in at an 
angle.   You can get this size tire in LT heavy duty etc.  

I had a chance of getting 195 SR 15s (metric size ) but they cost about $200 
ea and where would I foind one for a spare?  Would have been easier to put 
them off/on though.

Does anyone know what size radial tire will have the correct height when used 
on a stock bus  15 inch rim.

the stock tires would have been bias ply tires and pretty tall, 

its going on a stock height 58 panel with  the flat wheel well arches
