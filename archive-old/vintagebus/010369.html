At the risk of being a tad blunt, while there is merit in the caps/t
shirts/stickers etc ideas, if we ALL just donate $5/$10/$20, the funds issue
won't be a problem. ( And for those who wish to question it, yes, I have,
check with Ted &amp; Thom if you wish. )

I think it's fair to say that we all get benefit from the lists, and the
Type 2 &amp; Vintagebus sites, the guys running things are donating their time &amp;
efforts (AND money) to keep things running, so ALL we're being asked to help
with are the outgoing costs, communications costs, hardware costs etc,
bugger all against what we've saved in NOT getting VW unaware mechanics etc
to butcher our busses.

Once we get past the current problem, the occaisional donation ( using the
setup that Thom has, and i believe is being set up on type2_dot_com ) will keep
the problem away. Come on guys, the admins shouldn't have to ask us for
this.

Ok, back under the bridge now.

Neale
