Subject: 40 HP heads - reconditioning

So I'm pulling my motor tomorrow and I'm going to take the heads off and =
using Muir and Tom Wilson's book I'm going to check things out etc..  =
I'm taking my heads to a local machine shop that a stranger in a beetle =
recommended. What should I watch for?  What should I tell em? I'm kinda =
worried that they'll tell me that valves need to be replaced or =
something and I won't be able to tell em what kinda I want or from where =
I would like then to come. I would rather cheapo parts where not used =
but unless I know what I want .....

TIA
