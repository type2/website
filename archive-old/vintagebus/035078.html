Subject: Re:  [VB] Correct Wheel Color?
To: paul.dotson_at_lmco_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I am getting ready to paint my wheels on my 1959 deluxe and thought they
should be silver white (L82), but WW sight shows beige gray (L472). Anyone
know what they should be?

beige grey sounds like you upper half of bus.   (hm- sealing wax red 
dash&amp;lower half)   beieve it os silver white bumpers and wheels.    think all 
bumpers 58 &amp;later were silver white, the stamped ones were matching the bus.  
Not sure when wheels went to silver white, think at post barndoor.    yours 
would be silver white
