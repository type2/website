BINGO! Rob has got it...its all really Business
101...and did you ever happen to notice Business is
spelled BUSiness ;-

Rob is correct here.  True, I don't 'want' to sell my
westy...but I never REALLY wanted to sell any of the
50+ VWs I have owned over the past 15 years :-)  Ahhhh
if 'I' could only win the lottery!...hmmm think about
it I would be tripping over bus parts on the way to
the john!

Honestly my westy is real nice and complete.  It is
quite hard getting rid of a bus that is  very very
sentimental to me.  I have owned her longer and
traveled more in this one then any other bus I have
owned.  But other VW projects dictate the need for
$$funds$$ which I don't have...and besides I have a
`60 Westfalia which is the twin (honestly!) to the
`61...don't need a matching pair.

If anyone is interested in her...expensive safaris or
not...give me an email.

&gt;     Personally I believe that supply and demand and
&gt; need or want will settle
&gt; this matter.  If Todd sells his bus it is because of
&gt; the supply and demand.
&gt; If someone wants that bus(I know I do but the demand
&gt; would go to Citibank
&gt; and they demand hard(14+%)) and they are willing to
&gt; pay and Todd doesn't
&gt; really need the money then the price is what it is.
&gt;     Now if Todd needs to sell the bus (Citibank?)
&gt; and someone comes by and
&gt; makes a realistic offer then as the saying
&gt; goes(&quot;Cash on the Barrel&quot;) Todd
&gt; would miss his bus but he would have the cash!?  I
&gt; don't think that Todd
&gt; really wants to sell his bus and I know that he
&gt; really doesn't want to sell
&gt; his safaris but if the demand, on either buyer or
&gt; seller side) justifies
&gt; buying/selling the bus then there it goes.
&gt;     Todd don't sell the bus just yet.  I keep
&gt; hearing the voices to spend
&gt; the rent on lottery tickets cause they told me I
&gt; would win.
&gt; Would you take a IOU till I win the lottery if you
&gt; don't need the money
