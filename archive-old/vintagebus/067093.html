Hiya Sam,

The distributor you're looking for is VW 113 905 205T.  Although this was the 
original &quot;stock&quot; distributor, there are other distributors which will fit and 
function in this application.  Point your browser over to The OldVolks Home 
at http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm  for further listings of 
applicable distributors.
And FWIW...........  the SVDA offered by Aircooled_dot_net is wonderful in this 
particular application.  It's what I'm running and I'm very happy with it.
