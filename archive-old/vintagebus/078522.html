Subject: Re: [VB] z bed questions

the bay bed is narrower than a bay bus anyway.
&gt;there is that wood part that mounts on the drivers side wall that 
&gt;makes up a few inches.

that all depends. i have a full-width zbed out of a friends 73 IIRC. 
did have to take the armrests off  my bus'  wall, tho (my bus is a 
9seater that i have modified to be a camper).  otherwise they'd hit 
the seat as it unfolded and block it.
