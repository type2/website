a few weeks ago on the list, there had been some discussion about those
bolt-onto-lug-bolt-hole drum pullers, and how some people ruined drums with
them.  well, after not having mine today, and needing to free rusted-on,
can't even budge it drum, i spent about 2 hours beating, trying to drag it
with the tow vehicle fo free it, cursing, prying, hitting from behind with
a big hammer, lubing, CURSING, beating some more with a bigger hammer,
lubing some more, and then finally giving up, i went home to get the
puller.  this was on an early bug drum with 12mm lugs and i didn't have the
longer bolts like i use for the 14mm size holes.  luckily my friend bill
was going to the junkyards (again!) and got me some vw alloy wheel
lugs--long threads and 12mm.  just got back fronm the shop where the bug
is.  in less than 45 minutes, including 20 minutes drive time, the drum was
off, brake parts pulled so it'll roll, re-assembled, and i'm home and
showered.  no stripped holes.  came off easily, even with those darn
original style ball bearings that like to stay on the spindle (refer to the
2 hour saga previously in this listing).  folks, the key to those pullers
is to use bolts that go through a long way into the drum.  the stock ones
do not work, and you WILL ruin drums. get the longer ones at your local
junkyard. 
happy motoring.
