Subject: Re: [VB] Horsehair Pads - Preserve or Pitch?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Robert,
Have done a little of both and have been dissappointed both ways.  The foam 
never feels right and the springs cut it up into pieces.  The vintage horse 
hair tends to shred.  Next time we redo a seat we are going to either replace 
with new horse hair or if the original stuff looks still nice and thick.  We 
are going to spray with contact glue and fabric cover it on both sides and 
around the edges of the horse hair to help stick the material together, 
protect it from the cutting action of the seat springs, and seal it from 
dropping crumbs below the seat.
