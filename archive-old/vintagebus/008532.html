This repair is covered in the archives, I believe.

I've had good results using sheet lead to make the plug.  By holding the
sheet lead against the opening and rotating it slightly under pressure
you'll mark the lead with a ring of the correct diameter.  Then cut out the
plug using tin snips or sturdy scissors.

If you have a pin punch slightly smaller in diameter than the plug recess
you can get a pretty good seal by tapping lightly on the lead plug's
periphery after it's inserted.  Be sure the pressure is applied only to the
outer edge of the plug that's backed up by the small inner ledge in the
recess.  And as George suggests, top it off with some epoxy sealant.

I've never had a plug repaired this way fail again, even after years of use.

Some carbs have an original plug that's a cast part, with an inner shape
that matches the inside of the carb's barrel.  Replacing these with a simple
flat plug doesn't seem to noticeably affect the carb's performance.

FWIW.....
