Very old Volkswagen bus. After 47 years, storage tenant/estate stopped
paying.
                                  Papers say shipped from Germany in 8/51.
Very old, but looks and smells as new.
                                  Odometer reads 00039. Wouldn't start,
but maybe battery is dead. Keys are in the
                                  ignition. May not be legal to drive on
the highway as paper work in the bus indicates
                                  not for sale, but something about
prototype vehicle. First $1,000 + sales tax takes it
                                  OBO. We need the space for furniture
storage starting April 1.
