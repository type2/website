I'm a project car kind of guy, yet I would still object to some POS 
dismembered in a neighbors driveway.   You could drive right past my house
and not know I had a project going on unless I had the garage door open at
that exact moment.


That being said, don't even think about moving to Irvine in Southern CA.  There are areas where the &quot;association&quot; tells you what you can do IN your garage and at what times you can have your garage door open and for how long.  These are the same places that mandate you paint your house a certain color and put in your front and back landscaping in a mandated amount of time.  BTW you pay the association for the privilege of all of this.

No thank you I agree with Tom,  you'd never know I had 3 busses at my house unless I open my gate.  I don't work passed 10pm and in general am courteous.  That being said I'll be dammed if the city is going to run my life. 

If you're worried about crushing cars here in CA there are business advertising for people to bring in their old cars and crush them to &quot;clean the air&quot;.  Just a way for big polluters to buy pollution credits to allow them to keep polluting.  What a racket.
