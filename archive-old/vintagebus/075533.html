&gt;While I was at Wal-Mart I picked up a couple of the cheap trailer
&gt;lights. I use the housing for these older busses. The holes for the
&gt;housing lines right up with the holes for the stock taillight lenses.
&gt;So from the outside of the bus you'd never know what was going on.

Are these the ~3&quot; round kind, ~4&quot; square kind (Petersen Manufacturing
441) or other?

&gt;She was good enough about it and I could tell she thought it was
&gt;looking kinda cool.

You're pretty lucky.  If I were you I'd have a Westy in the stable,
so if the &quot;surpise&quot; didn't work out, you'd still have a place to sleep...
:)

&gt;So now I gotta get this electrical system figured out.

I remember you said that the truck seems to have the '62-'64 harness
in it, but I don't remember about the fuse box.  The stock '60 has
two less fuses than a '62 (the low beams weren't fused) which might
have engendered creativity on the part of the PO.  Hopefully they
would have just spliced the low-beam wires together, but they may
have left the tail light or battery+ignition fuse pairs off the fuse
box and handled those in creative ways.
