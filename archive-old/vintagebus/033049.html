This Friday I'll be leaving Kansas City early going up I-35 to Iowa till I 
hit I-80, then will take I-80 east to Illinois where I will visit Galena 
(wife's shopping request) and on to Peoria/Pekin area (family reunion).  I 
would LOVE to know of any VW bus related shops, salvage yards, or related 
points of interest.  Sorry I didn't get this posted on a Friday, but Friday 
will be too late and I'm hoping for a least one bus stop along the way. 
    Thanks in advance,
        Pink Newell
