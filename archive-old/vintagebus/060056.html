Subject: parts

Sorry I am new to Transporters/buses
I was trying to order some replacement tailight assemblies for my son's 1966
split window
The on-line catalog asked if it was a Type 1 or 2 or 3 ??? it gave a range
of years for each type, 66 was in all of them??? I thought buses were type 2
As a kid I ordered everthing I needed or wanted from JC Whitney. Is there a
sourse for 66 buses akin to J.C.Whitney??
I have found alot of catalogs for beetles, almost nothing for buses
Thanks
