I like the Westfailure. Best tow vehicle going. Barring the availability of
a stretched V8 Westy, get the longest wheelbase vehicle you can. A crewcab
truck or something. The longer the wheelbase, the easier the handling when
towing in crosswinds and such. Weight is also good, but secondary to
wheelbase. Third is horsepower. Don't worry about going fast if it doesn't
stay in its lane. All signs point to a stretched V8 Westy, but I may be
biased.

&gt; Well, I think she's got her heart set on getting rid of our Merkur and
&gt; getting a truck.  She feels it's time we own something that can tow any of
&gt; our VWs if they breakdown.  There are 4 people in our family, so we gotta
&gt; keep that in mind.  But I know a lot of listees have haulers that,
&gt; naturally, we all stay quiet about. &lt;g&gt;  But give us some
&gt; recommendations...what do you own? what do you like?
