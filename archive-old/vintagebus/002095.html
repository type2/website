&gt; The other day I tuned up my 65 westy.   Did the valves etc and then
started
&gt; it up to check the timing (I always check the advance, since I have had
the
&gt; advance stick a couple times.  Once this was in a bus in the SW desert and
t
&gt; got real hot because of this.  I must add at this point that I was a
&gt; passenger in that bus and hadn't done the tuneups on  it)

Hi Clara, (and everybody else too)
Reading your post, something clicked regarding my bus troubles, wanted to
ask your opinion.  Regarding the advance sticking on a bus, I'm assuming
that you're checking the timing with a strobe light to find this problem.  I
don't have one so I've never done it but I'm thinking that maybe this was
the source of the overheating I've been experiencing with my bus.
I do know that when I brought the bus home for the first time, it started to
run really badly somewhere around Montana, stalling and generally running
crappy, but good enough that I just kept going.  (I was by myself and really
wanted to get home)  When I took the bus in to my (aircooled vw) mechanic,
he said that the distributor had been &quot;sticking&quot; and was the source of the
problem.  I guess he'd done something to make it stop sticking; the bus was
now running fine.  He's a crusty old German man so sometimes I don't really
understand what he's saying.
I also know that, in my quest to get the motor to run at less than 220 - 240
degrees, the only thing that seemed to make any difference was retarding the
timing.  If it makes any difference, I'm running a 009 distributor.
The only other thing that makes me suspect the distributor is this nagging
feeling I've been having that I should get a new one.  Now, you may think
that's crazy but I often rely on intuition when fixing the bus and it's
usually been helpful.  For example, this spring in Colorado I had a nagging
bad feeling about the fuel pump.  I suspected that maybe the rubber
diaphragm inside was torn and that it might be leaking into the motor.  So I
bought a new one and went to replace it.  It turned out to be fine
internally, but when I went to take off the fuel line from the gas tank, the
brass fitting pulled right out of the fuel pump quite easily!  Basically it
was a big fire waiting to happen.  Coincidence?  Maybe.
Since I'm currently in the process of taking the motor apart to rebuild it
(for real this time - you may remember that I just replaced the pistons and
cylinders and put on new heads at the beginning of the year, but I didn't
split the case) finding out why it was overheating is a major goal right
now.  I believe that 11 000+ miles worth of extended road trip driving, with
the motor running super hot the whole time, probably caused some of the cam
lobes to self-destruct.  And who knows what other damage.  Presently I've
stalled at the flywheel removal point: I've never done it before.  And it's
freakin' cold outside.  But I digress...
Thoughts, advice, ruminations welcome,
Diana
