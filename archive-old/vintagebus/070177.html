If you check out the Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project and follow this link
http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part/587.png  they call it a spring clip
and say it was on chassis up to 614 455 (don't know what year) but my chassis # is
144 268 so maybe it is original, it certainly is rusty enough to be.  However, from
other things I have seen on this bus I would not be suprised if the headlights came
off of a model T.
