 Friend of mine found a '66 bus with about 30K original miles.  Been sitting 
 outside for several years.  Pretty rusty but has a lot of good parts.  I'm 
 mainly interested in the mechanical parts.  Anyone have any insight as to 
how 
 the trans, reduction gears, steering box, etc, might be after sitting 
outside 
 for a couple decades?
  &gt;&gt;
well, they work better if they have not been filled with water.  swampy area? 
  I have had mixed results with swamp bus parts.  Some times a few gear oil 
changes and the crud goes away.  thats rust on the gears.  They again I put a 
trans in my 65 from a swamp bus 67, and it was loud and popped out of reverse 
and the oil changes/driving didn't help so after a while I got a freekin 
rebuildt.   Rust in the bearings/bad bearings and synchros.  67 trans s have 
that problem with reverse.   If they sit, they may be okay, definately change 
oil frequently in trans at first like any mystery trans.

is the bus really dead, though?  what is serious rust?   it can be a very 
vague term

You can bring back to life buses that have sat for decades.  you just gotta 
use proper lubrication, and new rubber parts.  why not save it?  we must save 
them!
