Question 1: What was/is the difference in application
(years etc.) for the two hockey sticks as described
below?
Question 2: Will shifter plate adjustment alone
compensate for this situation?
---------------------
This week's repair du jour to my on my daily driver
'63 ratbus was to R&amp;R the clutch and cure many a leak
in the tranny area. Health, holiday, need to keep the
SOB on the road and hectic work schedule strongly
encouraged me to have someone else do some wrenching
for me. Leaks were suspected of spoiling the clutch
days following the carb repairs. It was time to
finalize a few nagging ills.

We installed a properly rebuilt (Kapatch) '67 nose
cone with fresh seal and the reverse switch. (Switch
for later hook up). We also changed a wheel bearing
seal, output shaft seal and the boots. 
This particular big nutter tranny has been a major
dripper since day one mainly due to usage of the only
iffy nose cone that I had at the time of initial
hastened install. Hadn't planned on needing a
different one at that time. Seal was marginal. Tranny
it's self has been great outside of losing gearoil
everyday. Always topped off the levels.
Long time VW mechanic who did the recent work told me
that he changed out the hockey stick (gear change
inner lever). He held it up for my inspection. Showed
me the pre-existing hockey stick with the real lazy W
shape and said that it should have been a straight L.
Claimed to have never seen the other type- thought it
must be some crazy type III or something. (Um, you
mean TypeI?) Shifting had not been a problem in the
past- now it is!

The straight L shaped hockey stick is illustrated in
the (thinner paperback/spiral-bound) &quot;Volkswagen Type
II Transporter series 1200-1600 Shop Manual&quot;, pg 87.
The very lazy W shaped hockey stick is illustrated in
the(thick blue)Bentleys &quot;Workshop Manual Volkwagen
Transporter 1963-1967&quot;, pg H6-2a.

Question: What was/is the difference in application
(years) for the two hockey sticks as described? 

Resulting work now puts the shift pattern closer to
the passenger seat and is difficult to downshift from
3rd to 2nd. Additionally, finding 1st at a dead stop
is also a joy. Minor tweaking to the shift plate and a
nudge to the clutch cable failed to cure these gear
selection woes.
Pushing the stick from the neutral position to the far
left and straight forward or straight back results in
&quot;hitting a wall.&quot; Shifter must be moved back to the
right about 1/2 inch then forward (or back) to get the
1-2 gears. Mechanic said that I need to &quot;get used&quot; to
the new pattern and or install a new reverse lock-out
plate or heavier spring. The plate was recently
replaced with a very healthy one prior to this repair.
I know of no &quot;heavier&quot; VW shifter lockout spring.

Question 2: Will shifter plate adjustment alone
compensate for this situation?

Question 3: Will the straight L hockey stick actuate
the reverse light switch? &lt;an easy test will tell&gt;
 
Thought that I'd save myself at least *one*
weekend/holiday of throwing wrenches and being my
wife's greasy husband, spend time with her and use the
holiday to get over my nagging chest cold.

I smell a customer come back in the near future.
