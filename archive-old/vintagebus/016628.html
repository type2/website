Hey all,

I was wondering what you all have seen original beltline moulding trim go 
for to do a complete bus?  I won't ask how much ya all think it is worth 
because I'll be told &quot;whatever someone (hippie, resto buff, or lawyer)  will 
pay for it.&quot;  Anyway its complete w/ rocker panels missing weatherstipping 
inserts and the tabby things that go between strips.  Needs buffing but no 
dents.  Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks and have a great weekend even if your not at the Classic!
