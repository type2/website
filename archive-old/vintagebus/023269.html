After several offline discussions with various people, I decided to change
my auction
site to allow proxy bidding, like ebay does.  This lessens the exposure
potential
bidders have when there is a disparity between the high bid and the
next-highest bid, which was the #1 concern.

Also, Mark has a bunch of old Blaupunkt, Akkord and Grundig pull out radios
up for auction,
some even NOS!  You don't see these very often!

In addition, the site is sporting a 42% sucess rate on auctions, meaning
items that were
auctioned sucessfully, and we're up to 320 users!
