&gt;&gt; From the 1963-67 bus parts manual:
311 105 295 A  Rubber seal (O-ring) - Flywheel From Engine No. H 0 140  936  
&lt;&lt;



&gt;&gt;  Hello   Is this a 6  volt flywheel???   I have never seen a 6 volt 
flywheel with the o  ring!  even the 200 mm ones didnt have the o ring which I have 
about 4 of  not counting the one running on my 63 SC  . You can also put a 12 
volt  flywheel on a 6 volt style crank by cutting off the outter lip where the 
o  ring goes   later and have fun  Mark Dearing   &lt;&lt;


Hi Mark,
From the 1963-67 bus parts manual:
211 105 271 C  Flywheel, 109  teeth -- Clutch 200  
(mm)................................44 bhp
from engine No. H 0 140  936 up to H 0 183 372
 
So far we have only seen six volt O-ringed FWs.  Which have the 109  teeth 
Vs. the later 12 volt 130 teeth.
Planning on having fun, later,
Eric&amp;Barb
