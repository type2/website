&gt; 750 lb engine stand - it's got adjustable arms, so looks like it'd work for
&gt; a VW....anyone?? - for $40, and if you add another 3 lbs to the order,
&gt; shipping's free.

Nope, it won't work as is, but you can make a steel adapter plate and bolt
a later bus bellhousing to the plate.  As I recall the arms are a little
too long for a VW engine.
