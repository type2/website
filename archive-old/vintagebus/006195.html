    I believe spiders can hold their breath for hours so the bombs don't
always work. I am a computer technician and right after we had one of our
houses tented I was cabling in the attic. The spiders were just hanging out
like nothing happened. So bombing the bus would probably only make you sick
and not the spiders.
