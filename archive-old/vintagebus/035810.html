&lt;&lt; I like having a barndoor bus.    But 
I am not putting it on ebay with the intent of creating a stir and then not 
selling it.   Of course, now you say you did it as a kick, but  I think you 
might be leaving the impression  that people should not take you at face 
value.&gt;&gt;

I'll give you 3000$ for it Clara!
