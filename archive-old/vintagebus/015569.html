im painting the westy this spring and after a lot research have found some 
good formulas for the colors i want, Palm and Sand Green. i was thinking of 
flipping the colors and putting the Palm on the bottom. anyone got any 
pictures they can send me? i got some good ones from VWPlanet of the orig 
scheme, i dont need those. hard to visualize without actually seeing itt, 
you know.
thanks first!
