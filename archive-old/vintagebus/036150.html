 the best thing for the electrical contacts.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Volks,
WD-40 would be one of the few normal lubricants we would use as a degreaser 
in a pinch since it evaporates in a couple of days it should not carbonize up 
the contacts too much.  Best to use a real degreaser if you can, then 
electrical contact cleaner and dielectric grease carefully applied to the six 
brass contact points.  The four brass contacts on the forward and rear side 
are easy to get to the other two on the handle side are a real pain to see 
let alone get the dielectric grease in there.  As for greasing the mechanical 
areas of the switch you have to be carefull to not grease everywhere.  To do 
so results in a switch that cancels all too easily when you do not want it to 
or worse will just pop to the neutral position as soon as you take your hand 
off the handle.    Eric&amp;Barb
