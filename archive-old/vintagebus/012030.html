&gt; &gt; Since a '67 Westy I'm hoping to buy will need paint, what are your
&gt; thoughts
&gt; &gt; on prepping for repaint? The original paint is quite faded, but
the bus
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; totally rust-free and dent-free. I want the flat side panels to be
as
&gt; clean
&gt; &gt; as possible. My paint shop recommends sandblasting, 
-------------------------------------------------------

My truck was oxidized.  I washed it with acid from my shop, comet,
then I buffed it with compound wax and a buffing machine.  Then I used
polishing wax to take out the swirl marks.  My paint looks brand new
except for the rocker panels amd where the emblem used to be(silicon
plugs to keep water and air out).
      My point is I think the shop wants you to pay lots of money for
blasting, body work, and paint easily costing you $5,000, where if its
only faded you can buff it yourself, or if time is small, pay a detail
shop $125 to $200 to buff it for you.  If you live in the Hi Desert of
So-Cal come over to my shop, and I'll do it personaly.  You'll have to
pay my boss some good money cause thats our time.  He usually charges
$65 to 4100 A CAR DEPENDING ON WHAT NEEDS DONE.  Caddilacs cost more,
cause we do more for those.  I'll treat it right, as opposed to a few
guys there that only work on newer cars.  It's not their fault, but
when you clean four cars a day, and almost all are late 90's cars, a
bus is completely different.  They wouldn't have the right touch, you
know. Thanks for you time.
