I dunno.  The bus was pretty straight with no major rust.  And as you say,
all the skylights were there, just not in with seals.  Had solid rockers,
and all the electrical stuff was there.  Also, the dash had not been
molested - maybe $3000 - but definitely not $6500!  BTW, did anyone that
went to Manassas see that awesome 64 bug with only 18,000 original miles and
in almost perfect condition - unrestored?

&gt;There was a 21 window with the skylights held in with duct tape, blah blah
&gt;blah for sale at Manassas last weekend for $6500.00. I wouldn't have paid
&gt;more than $1500.00 for it, but as already stated &quot;people think they're
&gt;sitting on a gold mine&quot;
