&lt;&lt; Thanks for the note Eric, you were right in part.
  The wasn't suffecient ground on the signals, and the project had been 
partially converted to 12v. After delving deeply into the harness (contortion 
required) I was able to make everything except the 4-ways work so far. &gt;&gt;
Hi Gary,
Great to hear you have things working better.  The grounding wiring of the 
tail lights is important and really helps keep them bright.  As for the 63ish 
and later 4-way E-lights you need to carefully go through the wiring and make 
sure each connection is in it's proper place.  While doing this clean all the 
connections and make sure to remove the passenger kick panel which the 
special relay for these E-blinker light system resides at the top of this 
area.  Hopefully just making sure the wiring is correct and cleaning of the 
connections will do the trick.  It did for us!  If not you either need to 
open the relay box and clean the points inside with fine sandpaper or worse 
comes to worse get a new relay box.
