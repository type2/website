Subject: Re: [VB] 6V to 12V

----- Original Message -----
&gt; &gt; I did find this and was wondering if anyone had used it and the
pros/cons of
&gt; &gt; it. Wiper motor voltage reducer
&gt; &gt; http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cart/DetailsList.cfm?ID=113955811B

I'm using one in my bus right now and it works perfect. Just make sure the
armature does not rub on the magnetic housing or it will ground itself out
and not work. I found out this is why my 6v wiper quit working in the first
place. haha. I put the 12v armature in anyway so that my wipers weren't
going on hyper speed anymore.
