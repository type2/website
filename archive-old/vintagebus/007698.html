Subject: Re: [VB] Owner's manual for '67 Westy

Brian:

Thanks for the info. Have the grey two part vinyl manual holder w/VW logo on
the front and the original SO 42 instructions.

Interesting... because I just found out a friend of mine has original
documentation with his '66 Westy and it comes with the Kombi on the cover of
the manual.

Maybe it doesn't matter which one it has .......

Scott

&gt; Mine came with the orange and white &quot;instruction and maintenance manual&quot;
&gt; booklet, with the deluxe on the front, and an instruction manual for the
&gt; SO-42 model westy, in a grey two part manual holder with a small vw logo
on
&gt; the front.
