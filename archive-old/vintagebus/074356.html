In my old racing days the adage was &quot;speed costs, how fast do you want to go?&quot;
This also applies to over sizing your engine. I have had good results over the
years with the minimal bump up to 1641 with 87mm P/S. Since CW cranks are so
low in price it is cost effective to get one now. If your case is not dual
relief, I would suggest going to one and a doghouse oil cooler if you don't
already have one. If you throw in and Engle 110 cam and gear or a J.C. Whitney
stage II cam (nearly the same grind) you will notice a little power
improvement. Hopefully you are using dual port heads, the engine needs to
breathe.

As far as help goes, get the Muir, Wilson, and Bentley books, keep them and
never loan them out, they are solid gold. The list is all you will need for
the brain store, so you are all set.

Ok, I have accepted the fact that I need a rebuild.  I was actually planning
on doing it this winter.  i am not afraid to get my hands dirty and I am no
stranger to tools or VW's.  Are there any decent kits available?  I would
probably like to go a bit more than a 1600.  I also understand the bennefits
of balancing.   I am a newbie when it comes to rebuilding and engine.
Anyone want a new student?
