Subject: RE: [VB] New engine

Thanks to all that responded,

To paraphrase: Buy local (or as close as possible), don't over-engineer
basic capabilities and stay away from GEX! 

All good stuff and I appreciate the experienced feedback.

Regards,

Jason

little 
work  myself but mostly farm stuff out.  &lt;&lt;
