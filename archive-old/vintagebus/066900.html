&gt;Someone finally took Andy Rooney seriously. Remember he is the one that
&gt;suggested that the army dump the M1 tank and replace it with Chrysler
&gt;Cordoba's.

Something very much like this happened in a semi-recent conflict.  I
think it was when the Soviet Union was in Afghanistan but I'm not 100%
sure.  One of the favorite weapons of the low-budget side was a T_at_y_at_ta
pick-up with a 50-cal mounted in the bed.  It wasn't a nifty automated
one like in the video; there was a gunner standing in the bed and a
driver.  I remember reading a newspaper article or two about it.  The
main reason they did it was economics - also, the trucks were a little
more maneuverable than the tanks.

I noticed in the video that they only aimed pretty much straight ahead.
I wonder if the gun mount allows it to be aimed the side -- maybe it
can but that gives too much body roll in the truck?

Bus content: I wonder how much the gun assembly weighs?  Do you need
a one-ton 21-window or will a Barndoor 23-window work?  Since both are
Deluxes, they already have the sliding rag-top.  If the gun doesn't
have its own electrical battery, I wonder if it would work on 6 volt?
Can you get the gun painted Sealing Wax Red?
