Hi Douglas,
Our 59 VW bus Shop Manual shows:
May 1959 with a .89 fourth gear (Printed 2. 61).
From June 1959 with a .82 fourth (Printed 2. 61).
We do not have our 63-67 VW Bus Shop Manual here, but we know it shows a .82 
fouth gear used in all 63-67 models.  It is the R&amp;Ps and RGB gears that were 
the differance!
The KG used the .82 fourth gear and resulted in a 65 MPH at 3,000 RPM.  The 
bug used the .89 fourth that resulte in a 60 MPH at 3,000 RPM.  In our buses 
with same sized tires on all four, .82 fourth and 3.875 R&amp;P results in a 
58MPH at 3,000 RPM.    Eric&amp;Barb
