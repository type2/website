Subject: RE: [VB] Glass-to-Frame Popout Window Seal Cupping

Hi Richard,

Go down to a good automotive paint shop and get a tube of seal
sealant... a black goo type stuff that is similar to contact cement
(i.e. apply to both side, let it dry a bit and then put the pieces
together.  Some will suggest roofing tar!  I've been offered an nos
safari seal by a friend for some time just to see as a reference but
it's never showed up :-(  (oh well, what can you expect for free :-O  )

You're not allow as I think they all have this problem.

Richard grappled the topic:

All,

I have recently begun assembling my new CE popout windows, and have had
a 
problem with the glass-to-frame seals cupping in the corners.  I have
tried 
just about everything I can think of to alieviate this problem -
applying 
seal conditioner to the frames and seals to help them slide better,
pulling 
the seals tight in different directions to avoid cupping, trying to move
the 
seals around in the frame once assembled - and no joy (but several now 
useless seals).  Is this a common problem?  Will the cupping sort of
resolve 
itself as the rubber &quot;settles&quot; into its new home?  Is there anything I
can 
do?
