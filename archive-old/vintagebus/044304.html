&gt;Be sure to tie something on to the old one when you pull it out.
That way you can snake it over the front axle in the enclosed part of 
the frame easier.
I printed out the color wiring diagram full size, framed it and hung 
it on my wall at work! (It is a work of art)
It took me about eight hours to complete the wiring. I was a 
construction Electrician for about 15 years so I have some 
experience. I cut the fuse box and holder out of a 62 and mounted it 
in my 59 because I liked the idea of having both high and low beams 
fused among other things. That way you can use the ends that come on 
the harness.
Good luck

&gt;There is really only one root source for the harnesses, and the mail
&gt;order supply houses buy from him.
&gt;
&gt;I put one in the '55, and it's very nice.  I had to strip each
&gt;and every dang wire end, because the '55 used screw terminals, but
&gt;it worked out OK.
&gt;
&gt;Print out a wiring diagram, in color if you can.  It will be infinitely
&gt;helpful when you're trying to get everything connected.

&gt;&gt;  Could someone with experience please tell me some things about the
&gt;&gt;  removal of the old &quot;harness&quot; and the installation of the new harness?
&gt;&gt;  What should I watch out for?  How much of a pain is this to do?  How
&gt;&gt;  much time should I expect it to take?
&gt;&gt;  How do i go about running the harness through to the back of the bus?
&gt;&gt;  There is a tube or something that runs through the frame...correct?
