Subject: Re: [VB] Leaky carb

It might also be worn throttle shaft bushings.  Grab the arm of the
throttle shaft, where the accel cable connects, and wiggle it.  If you
can see or feel play, gas could be leaking from where the throttle shaft
passes through the carb body.  Rub your finger around these spots and
check for moistness.  The fix in this case is to have the bushings bored
out and replaced by a machine shop like Rimco.

My 30-PICT-1 is just starting to leak in this manner.

&gt; driveway and then came in to let the dog out. I came
&gt; back out to the bus to install a new preheat hose.
&gt; When I opened the deck lid there was some gas dripping
&gt; from the carb onto the case. This alarms me. I dont
&gt; see it leak anymore, I install preheat hose then start
&gt; bus and watch for leak. I don't see it leak anymore. I
&gt; am going to switch the carb, but can anyone tell me
&gt; where my 28 pict might be leaking from, or why?
