&gt; Over my lunch hour today, I was watching TV and about choked on my hamburger
&gt; when I saw a commercial for the new Compaq Presario.  Featured is a splitty
&gt; bus (white over red) with corner glass and a 5 lugger rim on the front.
&gt; Anyone else see this _COOL_ commercial?

Anybody accidentally capturing this to disk and sending it to the UK
will be rewarded with a guided tour of my bus next time they're in the
country. I'll show you that our fine European rust can out-eat Uncle
Sam's rust anyday ;-)
