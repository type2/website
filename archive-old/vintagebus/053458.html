Subject: Re: [VB] engine porsche 356 ??

I believe certain 356s (the Super 90 model?) had crank and rods forged
together with maybe needle bearings in between, that's not VW
surplus...

Bus content: Bus runs rich, I must learn carb jetting. VW FLAPS say
they have the jets I need. I just borrowed a second working carb, so
if I mess up I still have a ride.

356, didn't that have the 1600 engine? (saw a porsche show on learning
channel and they talked quite a bit about the 356) Said it was made of
mostly leftover VW parts!

Hello

one of my friend got an engine he want to put in his combi

The guy said it was from a porsche 356, but i have no reference on
this
engine.

The number seems to be : P*00684

Any info on this engine (and possible engine tin and shroud as it came
barely naked) is welcome.

This was put in a kind of Hover boat, but the seller sait it was too
fast..
