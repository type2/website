first question...is it lowered as well?  If so, that will [can] change
your steering geometry enough to cause all sorts of bump-steer problems.

A worn steering box, though, would show itself as either stiffness in
turning the wheel, or in &quot;slop&quot; when turning the wheel back and
forth...that is, the wheel turns a bit before the tires themselves do.
(you'd be taking up the slack in the gears inside the box...)

Having slop here can also contribute to the problem you are having..but
might not be the cause.

Good, but it isnt great.  Even on a perfect bus you'll feel the bumps and
