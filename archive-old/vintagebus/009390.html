I've tried several times over the past 10 years or so to purchase &quot;Genuine
VW&quot; gear lube at VW dealers in Washington, Oregon, and California..  Brought
my own shiny new container and everything.  I was refused every time.

A couple said they would only sell it by installing it in their shop, then
said they couldn't do that, either, because their hoists would not
accommodate a VW bus.

So much for quality VW &quot;service&quot;.....

&gt;&gt;  I person once suggested to me that I try a local vw dealer or audi
dealer because they should have the stuff by the drum and should sell you a
gallon at a reasonable price - I never did call one just went with the
Amsoil.  &lt;&lt;
