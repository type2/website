&gt; agreed.  I love the FACTORY conversions, however I have no place in my heart
&gt; for &quot;hey jed lets see how well this bug ragtop fits in my 54
&gt; single!&quot;....thats why I was inquiring as to whats up with the &quot;long pipe
&gt; carrying conversion&quot;..vw or non?

Besides Ambulances, there were no such conversions at the factory. It is
my understanding that VW had many suggested conversions, and had outside
vendors to perform these conversions. Ziegler was one company that
turned panels and kombis into firetrucks. Other firms and individuals
did other conversions.
The first Westfalia was a good case in point. A  British couple took
their 52 or 53 bus to westfalia, a coachbuilder, who had nothing to do
with vw, and asked them to set it up as a camper. They then took the
vehicle through South Africa and wrote a pretty cool book about the
adventure. Only later did VW and Westfalia hook up and make &quot; official&quot;
conversions. The high-roof into hot-dog truck, garment hauler, movie
wagon, etc, were not wolfsburg options. Single-cab ladder trucks, pole
haulers, etc, were outfitted as the owners needed.
You can get sick about it if you want, btu I think that the
transporter's flexibility and the ability for a single vehicle to have
multiple lives performing different functions is one of the reasons so
many are still around, and still used. I'd throw my kombi away if I
couldn't camp in it this week and haul the lawnmower next week, and cut
the roof off for the homecoming pagent the next... well maybe not
that...
