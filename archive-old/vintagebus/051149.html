Subject: Listee stickers?

Hey everyone....I hope this isn't considered a friday topic...but here goes.

While washing the back window of the bus yesterday, I got to thinking about 
the old v_at_l sticker Crusty Van Bondage had put on the 63EZ before I bought it.

I really enjoy meeting new listees at the shows...but since there are so many 
of us, and no real way of recognition, I'm thinking of this-
Would there be any interest from the listees on a small simple window sticker 
stating 'vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com' or something to that effect??
Something visible enough to see in a bus back window.
I have a friend who can make vinyl stickers for me and for real cheap.  I was 
planning to sell them at shows for cost and maybe a buck or two to go the 
list fund. 

If there is interest, then I can have a batch made and take them to the OCTO 
show.....and we can see if this flies.

ADMINS:I checked the archives and list rules.....It seems like this should be 
ok ....am I correct?

Let me know..and I'll get to it.
