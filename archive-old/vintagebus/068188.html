Subject: re: [VB] Can you tell from the pics?

David suggested that he had purchased a 1967 bus...

Well David, I commend you on your interest in VWs and buses. I strongly suggest
that you did not buy a 1967 but rather a 1968 or later~ based on the vehicle
having a single windshield rather than two smaller windshields. 1950/51-1967 VW
buses are referred to as &quot;Splittie&quot; buses due to the vertical bar between the 2
windshields (which create a split). What you show in the photos is referred to
as a baywindow bus.

Make sure that you have a title, make sure that it has a transmission and front
suspension. Try to inspect the vehicle prior to paying for it. I would
recommend (if possible) passing on this particular vehicle, saving more money,
having faith/patience and watching websites like &quot;thesamba_dot_com/vw&quot; for a VW
more complete and hopefully close to your area.

Good luck.
