&lt;&lt; Hello all,
 What is the story on those reflectors that go above the rear tail lights?
 Some early busses have them some do not.  I would like maximum visibility at
 night and stay vintage at the same time.  Any sources?  I always thought
 that they were just a owner installed job but after looking at the set that
 Everett has for sale I'm not too sure.  His look factory.  Thanks.

barndoors came with them.  And post barndoor brakelight decklid non semaphore 
buses  (thus through part of april 57).   Buses with round glass taillights 
that were alo brakelights did not have reflectors

unfortunately, original ones are pricey
