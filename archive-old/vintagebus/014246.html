Subject: Re: [Re:  [VB] heater hose / heater box]
Message-ID: &lt;19991209221618.2908.qmail_at_awcst094_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

I put some clamps on the top part of the heater hose(in the engine
compartment) 4 total. I noticed in a catalog that there is some type of
seal/gasket theat should go somewhere along this chain...I think I am going to
try to get those.

Thanks

Clamping the heater hoses on both ends in the engine compartment is a
good idea - those things always tend to come loose.  This may not be
the only source of your smell, however.  Underneath your engine (lying
on the ground) there should be two (probably rusty) heater boxes that
surround your exhaust on either side.  These are the &quot;beginning&quot; of
your heat's trip to the front of the bus. Following the large (~3-4
inch diameter) hoses from here to the front of the bus, you may
discover cracks, holes, etc. which could also explain where most of
your heat is going.
Good Luck,

&gt; When I turn the heat on in my bus, there is a not so good smell
coming out,
&gt; should my heater hose have hose clamps on eithre end,and where the
hose goes
&gt; throught the engine tin? Is that all I need to do to correct the odor
&gt; problem?
