Hey, it doesn’t take Jerome to drive unsafe.  Last night I worked till 2am.  I drove my 62 DC home from work and drafted behind a 18 wheeler for 30 miles or so.  Unsafe as hell, but man I got home quick.  Nothing like getting sucked along 20 feet behind a semi at 65 mph.  BTW my DC is running sweet.  Not sure what happened, but the gen light is off and not glowing at all.  

I only tailgate truckers when there is no one else on the road ;-)  Unsafe and loving it.  Kids...only professionals should try this. :-)

I've been going to bus events here in the Southeast for several years
now, and I have to admit that I've traveled to a few in a *very* unsafe
bus. Partly due to neglect (brakes), partly due to ignorance (loose
reduction boxes). I can tell you that there is nothing scarier than a 3
hour trip on a six-lane interstate during truck traffic with loose redux
boxes...

I'm a little older and wiser now, and I guess the best advice I can give
the younger folks is... Get your hands dirty! Get under that bus, find
all that loose stuff, learn how everything works! If you HAVE to make an
event in a bus that is not 100 percent, at least you will be aware of
your problems and hopefully prepared for what might happen...

I carry a toolbox and lots of spare parts. If you don't have a toolbox,
carry a phone!
