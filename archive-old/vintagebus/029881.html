Subject: Re: [T2] Is there a min air flow for heat exchangers? SUMMARY - LONG

[...] A couple of people asked about the replies I'd gotten on this
subject;
I've included below all that were not cc'ed to all three lists that I
originally posted my query to.  Opinions are as variable and seemingly
overall as ambivalent as those of the FL electorate.

If you followup this message, PLEASE:
1) trim the original post
2) post or at least cc the list unless you're asking a specific question
of one of the people below
3) make sure you address the person you're asking the question about.

Yah, Netiquette 101, but lately....

&gt; You are following good logic in your idea, but your method will not produce
&gt; the kind of heat your after. Here is why. The stock blower from a 72-79 Bus
&gt; was only to supplement the engine fan at low RPMs. If you hook one up and
&gt; feel the output you will soon see that they put out very little. If you want
&gt; real air flow into the cab, get a boat bilge blower. These are 12v and less
&gt; than $25 ea. I have used these in the past with excellent results. Instead
&gt; of mounting them at the pack and making them try to push hot air up the
&gt; 12ft+ tube, mount 1 up front and make it pull the air from the back to the
&gt; front and blow it out the vents. To do this you mount it under the front of
&gt; the bus in line with the heat tube. You cut out a section that is just a
&gt; little longer than the blower and slip it in. If you still want to make a
&gt; recirc set-up, you can use the stock 72-79 blower out back to draw air from
&gt; inside and then blow it down through the HEs then the front blower will do
&gt; the rest. I speak here as one that has tried both ways. I have not found a
&gt; blower that is strong enough to push air that far through a tube that size.
&gt; You are better to draw the air though. There is info on this in the Library,
&gt; and the archives. One suggestion I would make though is to use a headlight
&gt; switch from a Dodge/Ford/GM. You want to run the power though the dimmer
&gt; part of the switch, this way you can control the speed. I had one that was
&gt; just on/off, it would cook you out in no time, but had no way to turn it
&gt; down. It was also loud. The second Bus I did this to, I used a Dodge
&gt; headlight switch, it allowed me to control the flow and noise level. I won't
&gt; own a Bus now without one.

&gt; Joe,
&gt; I don't know if damage is possible or not, but the '72 and up Buses never
&gt; did away with constant air flow through the heat exchangers.  The '72-'79
&gt; Buses have an electric booster fan for more heat output at idle but the
&gt; engine cooling fan still constantly pumps air through the exchangers
&gt; anytime the engine is running.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, in the Vanagon they stopped having the engine cooling fan supply the
&gt; air and they also did away with the electric booster.  However, they
&gt; rigged a blower mounted to the alternator pulley so again, air is always
&gt; flowing through the heat exchangers.

&gt; Make sure that the blower has the little flaps on the outlets and instead of
&gt; eliminating the stock setup, tee into it. That way, when you don't run the
&gt; electric, the flaps will close and the engine fan will do its thing, whether
&gt; the heater boxes are open or closed. When you do run the fan, it will open
&gt; the flaps and push air, so long as the engine fan isn't pushing more
&gt; pressure. The only time that it would be nice to have a second set of flaps
&gt; on the engine side, is when the engine isn't running, because you could
&gt; still use the fan for a few till the heat ran out. I suppose you would leak
&gt; too much pressure into the fan shroud and wouldn't get any more heat. The
&gt; bays had a relay that operated the fan only when the engine was idling, as
&gt; soon as the alternator kicked up the relay shut off and the engine fan
&gt; supplied all of the air.

&gt;        I did this in a '71, but with a blazer three speed blower mounted in
&gt; the well. No bad
&gt; effects, but it melted the PVC I used to repair the rusted out tube...Nice
&gt; heat!

&gt; I didn't believe any damage would occur either when I read it on the list, but
&gt; lo and behold, when a fresh-air tube came off of my fan housing during some
&gt; highway driving and I pulled into a side street off of the ramp, there were
&gt; people flagging me down yelling &quot;engine fire!&quot;.  No fire happened, but where
&gt; the oil was dripping from my valve covers onto the heat exchanger was the
&gt; place of the bellowing smoke!  I put the tube back on and all was normal,
&gt; including my oil drip..
&gt; 
&gt; No damage to the boxes, per se, but could ultimately damage the car.  (To the
&gt; list:  Anyone ever damaged the box itself from this situation?)

&gt; Joe,
&gt;     Barney Brenner sold a recirculation heater kit that I tried on my
&gt; '67 bus.   It needed a hole cut in the rear of the interior to feed a
&gt; blower which blew interior air into the heater boxes and so on.  The
&gt; fresh air ducts on the fan shroud were blocked off.  This heater made
&gt; the bus warm in very cold weather.  I needed to install a relay on the
&gt; fan motor switch as the heat rising from the heat exchangers was enough
&gt; to melt the plastic fan if the fan was not blowing while driving.  The
&gt; relay turned on the fan when the ignition was on.  I also ran this with
&gt; a front bilge fan.   I no longer run the recirculation system since I
&gt; really don't need it.  I would hook it up again if I did.  The heater
&gt; boxes do need the air so don't block this off.   Gary Gibson
