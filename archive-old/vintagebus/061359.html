The 'proper' path would be to do the cleanup with on the 14's and use
those.  D!cking around with 4-&gt;5 lug adapters is just asking for trouble.

&gt; My 15 inch wheels are nice chrome and mag wheels, with a painted center

&gt; The only problem with the 15 inch wheels is that they are4 lug, so I'd
&gt; need a set of adaptors.  Question, will the adaptors allw this size tire
&gt; to still clear the rear wheel well?  The height and circumference is
&gt; about the same as my 14 inch wheels.  I know that 14 inch is stock.
