Scott does this mean single resistors of different value and wattage
according to the current draw of the item?? Barry Wright


 The motor draw much more current than the clock.
&gt; Lets say the motor draws 5 amps and the clock 0.5 amp.  In order to drop
the
&gt; voltage by 6V and provide the wipers with 6V, the V in the equation above
= 6.
&gt; We know I =5, solving for R
&gt; R = V/I   R = 6/5   R = 1.2 ohms.
&gt;
&gt; Now we use this same resistor to power the clock without the motor being
on.
&gt; We know that the clock I is 0.5 amps and R = 1.2 ohms
&gt; To solve for the new voltage drop across the resistor,
&gt; V = I * R, V = 0.5 * 1.2, V = 0.6V   That is a 0.6V drop across the
resistor,
&gt; leaving the remaining voltage for the clock.
&gt; 12V - 0.6V = 11.4V to the clock.
