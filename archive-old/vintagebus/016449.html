hey,
well now you know... i finished the top of my bus and need to keep going 
with the bottom. i need a passenger side dogleg for a '66. i will try a 
repop if i cant find a used one. i have talked to the MetalWiz and he dont 
like the repop's so i KNOW i will have a hard time with one. if anyone is 
parting a bus and has oone let me know soon, i want to get cracking! i dont 
think i could afford NOS, so NOS need not reply;)
thanks in advance,
