To: Chris &lt;ncbus_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;, vintagebus &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

OR,
Sell Chris the mesh platinums and I'll buy the Mesh
Greys (you listening Chris? I need some for DARTHVW)
Or if Anyone else has a set or even just the passenger
door side, it's really all I need.

PS: Anyone see the red 23 window in Bishop, CA which
didn't nmeet the reserve at $7500?

Just wondering why it didn't go higher. Looked sweet
and all orig. 

Jason

deluxe color, but the rest of my bus has mesh grey for
now--VW&quot;  ;^)

&gt; to trade let me know. On
&gt; a scale of 1 to ten, I would give the panels I have
&gt; about a 6.5.
