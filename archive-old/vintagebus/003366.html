Subject: lag in acceleration

Hi All,

What: 36 hp engine, acceleration seems to lag when you step on the gas (ok,
I know it's only 36 ponies) but if you put the foot all the way on the gas
or open the throttle by hand, the motor will actually die!

I've adjusted the points, set the timing at 10 degrees, drained the carb
bowl (nice and clean), made sure the choke is open, etc etc.  It does run
much better after I did that last night but still not what it should be.

I'm going to adjust the valves this evening.  I'm also considering changing
the coil and plugs.

Is there something else I should consider?

TIA

David
