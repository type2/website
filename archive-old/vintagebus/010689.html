Hi Rex,
We forgot to mention when installing the fix windows to paint the body frame 
with tar before installing the glass and rubber.  Duh!
Also after completely cleaning and washing and letting the areas dry for a 
couple of weeks during hot dry weather we also paint the lower 1/4 to 1/2 of 
the inside of the doors to prevent rust out.  The front doors have the the 
added inner reinforcement channels that we have seen rust hide in and eat 
it's way through the outer skin of the doors.  A thin coat of tar is far 
better than thick which tends to peel off much sooner.
Tar is not only a sealer, but a petroleum product which like oil and grease 
soaks into the rust and inhibits it.  Definitely apprieciate the info Ronnie 
posted on the 3M product Rust Fighter.  We or someone else on this list needs 
to do some salt water tests to check which might be just better for 
applications to enclosed/hidden body areas.   Eric&amp;Barb
