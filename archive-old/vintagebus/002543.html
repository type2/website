Subject: middle seat questions

Hi y'all,

I've picked up a 2/3 middle seat for my '65 bus at the VW Nats in
Sydney, but there are no fastening holes in the middle floor plates for
bolts (only on the outer plates for a full-length seat). I guess this seat
was not meant to be for a '65, or the 2/3rd was never an option for a '65.
I've got some donor plates I can install
so it's not a big problem.

Question is - what models is the 2/3 seat for, and are they any rarer than
the full-length version (I haven't seen many in Oz.). If it was just an
&quot;option&quot; why won't my floor accomodate it?

Cheers,
Steve J.
