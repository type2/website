&gt;A quick note...Tempered glass CANNOT be cut.  The slight amount of heat
&gt;differential, as well as the spreading of the crack, will cause the whole
&gt;piece to explode.  Dont believe me?  Find an old, fogged, piece of
&gt;tempered glass you dont care about.  Take it to your belt sander, and
&gt;slowly begin to try to polish the edge.  Be sure you wear gloves!


However most good shops can cut a piece of glass to your pattern then have
it tempered.  However this still I guess technically isn't right for a
windshield in the modern sense with lamination.  For those of us who are a
bit ignorant is split glass laminated from the factory in the late 50's say
or just tempered &quot;safety&quot; glass.  Tempered glass runs about 3-4 times per
square foot that of regular plate glass around here.  On an aside dad put
regular plate glass in his '66 years ago he told me once but after all he
had the sense to realize in a front collision he was probably dead anyway.
