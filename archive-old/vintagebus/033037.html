&lt;&lt;  For some odd reason I thought the What-Not cabinet was the cabinet on
 the left side rear when you open the cargo door.  [If not, what is that
 pieces name?]  &gt;&gt;
Hi Joe,
Actually it is on the rear cargo door on LHD, and probably on the rear cargo 
door on RHD westies.  The name for it, believe it or not, was a linen cabinet 
(Waschregal) part # 231 067 843.   Eric&amp;Barb
