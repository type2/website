&lt;&lt; Could I just extend the wires some how and see what my rpm's are when I'm 
driving.  I really don't want any gages in my bus but I temporary set up 
could be informative. &gt;&gt;

Hi Jdd,
That is what we do since after a good fifteen minute drive you should have a 
list of what MPH is 1,500 &amp; 3,000 RPMs in all four forward gears.  After that 
having a tach installed is only good to show the RPMs you are doing while 
idling.
