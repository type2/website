I have a '62 panel van that needs to be a daily driver at freeway speeds
(65 mph - 70 mph).  I know that &quot;freeway&quot; trannies are available for bugs,
but are they available for busses?  If not, is it feasible to convert the
bus to IRS and install a bug tranny?  I've heard that these are done, but
have reservations...what is the best choice?

get ready to spend some dough.  (but forget that irs thing, don't do it)

    I am getting such a thingy for my 65 camper- a tranny with a 3.875 ring
and pinion, and the 46mm rear axle boxes which have 1.26 reduction gears.
Todd may write and  mention how it needs parts from a number of trannys to
make it, and so it  costs more than a regular rebuild.

as the 1.26 reduction gears take the 64-67 brakes, you will need to swap your
front suspension to a 64-67 so you will have appropriately matching brakes in
front.   the 66/67 ones came with a front sway bar, which is nice.  (can be
retrofitted onto 65 and earlier beams too.)

and as steering play will be more noticable/annoying/dangerous at higher
speeds, make sure all the steering components are in good shape.

I probably left some thing out, and probably Eric and Barb will write in with
numbers for road speed/rpm ratio, and talk about tire size.   They struggled
for a long time and through several trannys trying to get 55mph at 3000rpms,
after putting along at 46mph at 3000rpms in 4th, and after all that decided to
be able to go faster than 55 after all.

the reason for the 1.26 reduction gear boxes for speed is like this: 
  Say if you were going 70mph in a bug (no r.boxes).  
 The 1.39 (55-63 boxes w/36mm nuts) take it down to 50.36mph,   
the 1.26 (64-67 boxes w/46mm nuts) take you to 55.56mph

with everything else the same.    So in my truck I am probably doing 3000rpms
at about 50mph by the speedo, as it has a tranny that feels geared to the
shift points.  Not that I know for sure, as I haven't had a tach on it.   My
61 goes 58 mph by the speedo at 3000rpms in 4th (which is about 62mph road
speed due to larger tires), with the larger 64-67 r.gear boxes and a later
ring and pinion (not identified exactly as I haven't been in there).  It feels
real nice- has really light shifting   (replace your  shifter bushings for
better shifting), a lovely dash with stylee 8 track player (I have been
enjoying War on 8 track- Lowrider) and a 1600sp engine on an A case with new
German cam and lifters, round barrel carb and oil bong action air cleaner
hanging off the the left 40hp style, gives plenty of go to the beast, quiet
too, with a stock bus muffler (except I have a little Phut every so often from
a exhaust donut I need to replace) and about 17,000mi on it.    Just got some
Van Halen on 8 track for that butt rock kind of feeling.
