I was sooo glad to see she wants a bus with the sliding door. I would suggest 
vanagon or eurovan to her.

&lt;&lt; I got this note from a lady in Michigan, but thought I would pass it on to 
 the list. I did tell her about vintagebus_dot_com and type2_dot_com. I know there 
 are other sites out there or others with more knowlege than I have. Maybe 
 someone can contact her or maybe a local Vdubber can help.
 
 Here is her address and what she said:
 
 Her name is Mink  and address is   minkett_at_zensearch_dot_net
 
 
 
 Hi, I was recently reading your classified ad and decided to drop you a
 line.  I'm in the U.S.A., in Michigan, and I was wondering if you could
 help me. I have wanted a bus for years, in fact, I lived in one until I
 was five w/ my folkie parents.  I have even owned a '69 Beetle and have
 had some experience with engine work.  My boyfriend and I are planning
 to travel the country in the upcoming summer, and I am wanting us to
 finally take the plunge and get a bus. My problem is this- I'm having no
 trouble finding busses for sale, but when looking at listings I have no
 idea which type of bus is which!  Vanagon, Westfalia, Camper, Kombi,
 EuroVan, Generic Bus, Type 2...(not to mention special issues etc)  The
 list goes on and on, and I have no idea which is which, and no idea how
 to learn and find out!  When I do purchase one, I want to make an
 educated purchase.  But how can I do that if I have no idea what the seller
 is talking about?   Please get back to me on this!  I REALLY appreciate
 it!  Sincerely, Mink
 P.S.  Here is what I want:  the kind of bus with the tire on the front,
 a pop top for sleeping, and a little sink console, the sliding side
 door, and a back door too.  This is what I lived in when I was little &gt;&gt;
