 I was looking at all the scratches in the back window of my 66 Deluxe and
 then I looked at my 77 Westy heated back window......
 I measured the opening.....top to bottom and side to side were identical.
 Then I looked up both seals in a WCM catalog...... both are the same,
 211-521C.
 Both windows are Sekurit......
 I can get bay back windows all day long along with bay rear defogger
 switches....
 So my question is: has anyone put a heated bay back window in a split??
  &gt;&gt;
It was actually available as an option in 1967, and would have a little red 
light on the dash that comes on when the defogger is on, same as an Italian 
spec brake warning light.
