&gt;There were not even any pictures of the cab or
&gt;interior...only pics of the drivers side exterior showing the crank out
&gt;windows.

You don't need to say if it's a panel. If the rain deflector louver is part
of the window assembly, it goes in a popout window opening. if it is a
seperate piece that screws to the vehicle body, it is a cut hole. As a
general rule. YMMV

&gt;BTW thanks for all the condescending mail re: my post.  Its good
&gt;to see the M-code Nazis are not asleep at their posts :-}

You are very welcome. If the undesireable discussion of a topic that you did
not intend to start commences from a part of your post, and this causes you
discomfort, the best way to avoid it is to include no words in your posts.
IMHO. I didn't read anything that was condescending, maybe that was a
reference to p-mail? It was just, as you say, a discussion of minutae. You
don't have to get pissed off...
