Subject: SC Roof Clip and Update

Well I found out why my roof sounded so solid, about a 1/2' of Bondo on
it, you can see the moon scape at

http://www.my.treeway_dot_com/64vwtruck/

This is the third week of class and I have gotten all of the outside
body, except the two side  gates to bare metal. The fun part of getting
rid of the dings starts now, then if I have a rainy night I'll take the
gates so I don't have to drive the primed truck in the rain.

If any one in the South East has a Single Cab roof clip in better shape
than mine please let me know, I should go that route if
I want the truck to be right. Also does any one have some good wheel
wells?

Thom actually told me he had to scrap a good SC Roof Clip when he moved,
no one would take it, of course I didn't need it
then, but I bet that would have been fun to ship, if at all!

And were off to another weekend of Camping with the Moonies and
Ocktoberbus, see all you southeast folks there!

Meredith
