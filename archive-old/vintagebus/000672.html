Subject: [VB] RGBox disassembly
Message-ID: &lt;0.cc0ee17.259a8605_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

WellI finally took aprt these RGBoxes I have meant to for a while.   I had 
the axle tubes off , this is about the inner part you see.   Tranny out, 
outer housing of box already off, axles and tubes off tranny already.

First I had got the tubes and inner housings with stub axles still in all 
cleaned up, no layers of crud and dirt and grease anymore.

Next step, remove plugs.   I took a razor blade and cleaned the rest of the 
crud around the plug, so it could be pulled out w/o dealing with grit in 
theway

Next scribed the exact center of the plug and used a center punch to tap a 
nindent and drilled a small hole.

I had had this theory that a slide hammer would be good, and drilled the hole 
bigger on one plug.  Them saw it would be difficult.  Wandered around 
scratching my head, then took a long screw with a 11mm ish hex head and used 
that (it caught the hole in the one I hadn't drilled out too big) and it 
pulled the plug out so nice and easy I was amazed.   Found a bigger screw 
after hunting and did the same to the other side.  Much easier than I 
thought.  The screw pushes against the stub axle

Now there is a nut holding the Stub axle .  It was mashed into the axle at a 
point to keep it from turning.  I pryed the stuff back, then drilled what I 
couldn't pry .  Used the air impact  (1/2&quot; with adaptor for the 3/4&quot; drive 
41mm socket) on it.  Problem was this impact the button had just gone funny 
and didn't relase by itself so the thing is spinning like a madman and bits 
are flying I got it shut off but I didn't find the nut till I crawlked around 
with a light looking in unlikely places.   Was more careful with the other 
side.    There was also a Circlip somewhere in there

 Tapped the stub axles out (easy)

Tapped the lower inner bearing out, also easy, they were both thrashed badly.

The upper inner bearings I used my 6 ft pipe tapping down the axle tube and 
they came out easily.

OKay, all apart, think I have the right replacement bearings now.  Bothe the 
inner ones were 6306s.

Hope to have this done back in my in a few days, well, by Y2K  (ha).  

Anyway, it wasn't too bad, I expected much worse.  Took a couple hours, 
including hunting for the hiding nut.
