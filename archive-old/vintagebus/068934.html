&gt; I'm using wheel bearing grease.

Hi Markus,
Good!  We use lithium front suspension and bearing grease.

&gt; I'm wondering about the tightening tho.  I tighten it sung, but so that I ca 
&gt; still move the washer with a bit of force.

That does not sound so good.  We put everything together and then spin the 
tire to help seat the bearings and snug the locking nut down till you feel 
the bearings stopping the nut from snugging down anymore.  Then we turn the 
nut back off 1/8 to 1/6 of a turn and lock it there.

&gt; Also, its possible that one brake pad is not adjusted right...I'll be fixing 
&gt; that today.
&gt; 
That should not be effecting the bearings, but is a good idea for best 
brakes.

&gt; I'm also pretty sure my alignment is off, but the tires arean't showing any 
&gt; wear...
&gt; 
Also make sure to check your front suspension camber shims are properly set.  
If the bearings still are going bad after all this you need to replace that 
spindle.  Could be that side is bent.
