&gt; buses came with plastic escutcheons in the front, and chrome ones for the
cargo doors.

Which is why I cannot find any then!  I have one repro cargo eschuteon and
that is poor quality, the centre bore is of a much bigger diameter than the
handle?

&gt; cargo door... panel... spring (light) ... chrome ring..handle

Anyone got a picture of the spring so I have some idea of what I need to
look for?  I bought one spring but it is way too big - this was bought from
the same supplier as the poor quality repro eschuteons

&gt; front doors... spring or foam square...panel... ring...handle

My doors have foam remnants there so I will get some more foam.  Any idea of
the thickness required?

&gt; installation tips: http://home_dot_comcast_dot_net/~sunrisebus/install.html

Thanks a lot for that - very useful

Regards
Paul
