Subject: Buses in the Shop 1, A Success!
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey all, wow, today was incredible!!  :D  For a 23 year old who helped
start a chapter of SV2s only five months ago, our first public event went
very well!

We had a good turnout...about 50-60 people in about 30 buses...they did a
good job of filling up Stockton Ave.  The event started slow...last minute
runs to get items...but the people there spent a lot of time around my
camper/club booth talking about stuff and accepting memberships/selling
club merch.  I think over the whole day, we took about 13 memberships and
almost sold out of t-shirts alltogether!  More and more buses trailed in
and a few shop tours were given by Ray Schubert (owner of Volks Authority
and of some really rare cars).  Opposite my camper was Ray's '50
Barndoor...well, 2/3 of a Barndoor...it has a long and damaged history, but
it's #5988!!

Inside the shop sat a 55/56 European double door panel with factory
blanked-out rear hatch awaiting restoration, '43 Schwimmer also in resto,
'50 Convertible, and '52 Sedan!  I'm forever impressed when I go over
there.  :)  One of the last minute items were raffle tickets so we could
finally have a raffle...we gave out some pretty nice items...nothing huge
like a set of safaris or an entire Bus...but everyone had a great time.

Okay, I'm babbling now from sun stroke...it was hotter today than expected.
 They called for a decent marine layer, but at 6am it was all clear skies.
I want to personally thank the guys at Volks Authority for providing the
food and the location, all the chapter members who came down and helped
watch the booth, and a huge thank you to everyone who came from as far away
as Monterey, Walnut Creek, and Marin to be there!  It's dedication like
that to the hobby that really makes all the work behind an event worthwhile.

Digital pictures will be up hopefully later tonite or by tomorrow evening.

Thanks all who made it!!
