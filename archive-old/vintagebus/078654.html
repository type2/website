Richard:Welcome back to the VW Bus People and this list   You are a shinning
example that the VW in our blood never dies--uj





My thanks to the many list members who emailed, on and off the list,
with comments and encouragement. I've thrown my lot in with a great
bunch of folks, and I hope to meet as many of you as I can on the road
and at meets in the future.
