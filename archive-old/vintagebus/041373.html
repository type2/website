I use latex for working around grease environments.  For solvents you need
nitrile gloves.  I use thick ones, not the disposable ones.  Whatever
glove you use, try  not to keep the glove immersed in the solvent any more
than needed.  Some solvents will go through even the best
gloves.  Kerosene or similar things are probably not bad compared with
chlorinated solvents as used in brake cleaners.
