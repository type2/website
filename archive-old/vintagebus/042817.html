	Jerome was a soul lifting experience.  This screed does it wrong.
I mean I'd be lying to say there's nothing interesting to tell about
Jerome except the egregious prevarication and shameless bogosity
transpiring everywhere, at once, on this list, and now can be
neurotropically traced in clusters around all those who were drinking from
the watering truck filled with cyanide laced water or in the feeding
troughs of Campo du Havasu, or in VW Howard's Boat drinks and any other
place that could hear the steam whistle blow at Jerome. The ABC are
entirely to blame for the whole sorry bag of stuff passed out.

	Talk to the hand ;-] puppet.  Now you know what is going on in
Jerome.  I won't further insult your intelligence. Some would say this was
an excellent example of VW shows.  Again, I agree.  They were simply
right.  Righteous, I tell you. They know they can show their loyalty to
the ABC party apparatus and how to avoid nasty public inquiries into ABC's
character issues at the same time.  Like the all the work that went into
the raffle bus, and Katie giving back the raffle bus, and the horizontally
opposed proclaiming that the roof rack stays!  Most importantly was the
few grand that was donated to the Children's Burn Camp - Now that's
honorable.  Pure jam it into your ears and collapse on the floor probity.
And if there is a God who grants VW nuts energy and works mechanical
miracles on their deserving/undeserving behalf, perhaps She/He will bestow
upon me the precious ability to identify precisely the truly excellent ABC
Jerome hosts among the multitudes of other show hosts that I've never
attended.  And I will be thankful beyond words and you'll never have to
read another boring show report from me.

Gunning the motor, popping the clutch and lunging out head-on into the
slow dragger's,
