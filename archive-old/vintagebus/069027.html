Subject: Re: [VB] Snap ring pliers

&gt; one of the same model, and they've improved the collet design.  Some day,
&gt; I'llget off my ass and order a replacement part for the old one, but I
&gt; needed the saw in a hurry on the day it brok

A well written letter expressing your feelings about their product and
the fact that their bad design on a part (the collet) of that tool just
might get you a free part or even a free tool (express your dismay at
the tools failure and your uncertainty at purchasing another from them)!

You'd be surprised at what a well crafted HAND WRITTEN letter to a
manufacture will do.  My grand mother used to do this all the time. 
Usually it was not to complain, but to compliment the manufacturer on
their product.
