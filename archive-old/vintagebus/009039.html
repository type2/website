I didn't get anywhere's near the amount of stuff done that I had wanted to
but I did manage to get some chromoly pushrods from my friend Frank in
Lincoln.  After I got home at 5:15, I spent the next 4 damn hours trying to
get my valve adjustment back and it turns out I had to custom make my own
shims for the rockers and then the pushrods would get hung up in the lifters
and not seat properly.  Whatever - I finally got it figgered out but it took
way longer than it should have.

A buddy came over about 9:00 and I welded a piece of his busted recliner
chair together for him so in exchange, he helped me lift the 1600DP on the
stand so I could pull the Berg sump off.  It took me about 3.5 hours to do
the swap - draining oil, custom making my own pickup tube, swapping studs,
and all that malarky.  I also dumped about 6 quarts of oil into her and
fired her up.  It runs a little noisier with the chromoly pushrods (Which I
gapped at .004 across the board) as well.  It seems that tomorrow I can
finally spend time running the wire for the temp sender and hopefully get
the stereo installed.  I'm going to take a 100 mile test run to Lincoln and
back so if I don't break down while doing this drive, I'll consider myself a
shoe-in for the BNNTA trip.  TTYL!
