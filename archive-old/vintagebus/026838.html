Latches for pop out windows

from VIN 832 733  (sept 61) took 221 847 081 D - the ones with white plastic 
knobs on,

as these are physically interchangable with the spoons, they dont keep track 
of which went exactly where.

the long spoon is 221 847 083, and a bus would get up to 5, the 6th getting a 
short spoon on the cargo door behind the cab door.

buses up to 20-76 673 got 
221 847 081 for non deluxe (black knobs) and 
221 847 085 (white knobs) for deluxes.  these attach differently, and are not 
interchangable physically with the later frames.  a bit different too where 
the latch goes to the bus body.

They also list a 211 847 085A (for use in vehicles in which side panels are 
replaced)

the early DC latch is omitted- this is a later 60s edition- 63 ed updated - 
but some version are also not on the list.

58 ed also has a 
211 847 081A, from 20-76 674, which I would think would be the short spoon.

okay, not much help.  But seems to me long spoons were used something like 58 
through early 61, on buses with 6 pop outs. If you had 2, you had short 
spoons.  That's probably it, the list makes no parts distinction between from 
the early barndoor through 61, unless you have 6 pop outs.   Just an 
impression,  though that could have been 61 and earlier.  FWIW my late 61 (no 
pockets in door panels) deluxe has 2 pop outs with short spoons. 

most of the M code lists around are late ones.  I believe that the 61 and 
earlier mcodes could be different.  Such as at one point the US spec code was 
164- I think for brake light deck lid buses, while later it was sliding door 
instead of hinged cargo doors.   So 114 is 6 hinged side windows as of 63 or 
so, but earlier it was different.  The export package changed as lights etc 
on buses changed, so the code changed.  They didn't started stamping M code 
tags till late 58 or so. Does anyone have an earlier M-code list than a 63 
list?   I have seen later lists, for baywindows, and things keep changing.

Maybe I should started studying the supercession lists.  excitement.

 &gt;Do you have long or short spoons?   What is the vin on your 61.  I think
 &gt;perhaps they changed from long spoons to short spoons at some time.
 
 
 Bus was built October 60. I don't have the exact number in front  of me 
 right now.
 It came with long spoons.
