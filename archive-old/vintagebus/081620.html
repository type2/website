Subject: NEATO 2005 JunkYard Calendar

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

      http://www.phorce1_dot_us:8080/neatocal

      Now you will need Adobe 5 or better to use this clickable updateable 
calendar! IF you know of a date that should be on this calendar than get it 
to captoaster_at_cox_dot_net and I will update it. You can take all 14 sections of 
the calendar and save them and make it as one by using the multiple files 
command and putting it in order!
      Some of the dates that I have did not get on the website as I had sent 
a early copy in that did not have Transporter Fest on it but will be on 
after the first update this week!



      Happy Holidays from NEATO!!
      Rob Laffoon
