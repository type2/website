&gt; whats worth more on a 66 bus, a bench front seat, or a walk through, (or
did
&gt; they only have walk throughs) its a 13 (?) window 66 (that I have)  thanks

I have a 66 13 window [hardtop Deluxe]. It is a non-walk thru with a 1/3 -
2/3 front seat, not a full bench. I also have a 67 Standard [11 window] that
is a walk thru. Between the 2, the walk thru is much more comfortable to
drive. The drivers seat is lower and I sit further back. Being 6 feet tall,
I don't have to bend over to see out like I do in the non-walk thru.
