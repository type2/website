&lt;&lt; no, don't wire the flap open.   VW does recommend that when your average

 is above 70 and you dont want pre heat anymore.     &gt;&gt;

Hi Volks,
Definitely do not wire the flap open.  VW designed the aircleaner in such a 
way to allow one to carefully tuck the balance/wieght wire handle of the 
preheat flap under the side seam/flange of the air cleaner.  So no wiring 
is/ewas required.  Eric&amp;Barb
