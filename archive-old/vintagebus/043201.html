&gt; Driving without a cluch is definitely a skill every bus owner should have.
  You never know when you will need to get to work on a holiday weekend when n
o parts stores are open or the part isn't available.

Driving with a spare clutch cable and some simple tools and grease is a
better skill to have. It takes one half hour or less (my time) to replace
a clutch cable and adjust it, and be on your way. A towel is useful for
cleaning your hands.

You never know when the parts stores may be out of stock on the spare
cable coiled up under your seat.
