It's amazing where a little persistence gets you.

After my last post on this subject, several listees including Douglas Wright (way ta go Dug!) telephoned Derek Gregg.  Seems as though there has been a change of heart and Derek is going to do a limited run of his bows.

I also spoke with Derek's wife Dawn on Tuesday, and she confirmed.  She also sent me a flyer explaining the situation, so here it is:

Beginning February 1, 1999, Derek will be doing a limited run of bows.  At least limited at this point in time.  If they receive a deposit check of $100 prior to 2/1/99, the price per set is $250.00.  After 2/1/99 the price is $300.  I'm assuming this includes the bow caps, but we all know what assuming does.  So, I'll call her/him back and clarify this.  The original bows are each made of three pieces, so in order to ship them, Derek will not weld the three pieces together, so some basic welding will need to be done once you receive them.  Shipping is $30.00.  For So. Cal listees bows can be picked up at Pomona or any of the other West Coast events that they will be attending.  This will obviously need to be pre-arranged with the Gregg's.

I'll let you all know about the caps.  Whew, I'm relieved that I don't have to try and make the stinkin' things now, things weren't looking promising for my bows.  Woo Hoo!

Robert
