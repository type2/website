  Al,
     When I was at Wolfsburg West in February they had sandblasted and primed
  popout frames for sale.They also had powdercoated frames for sale,though I
  cleaned
  there stockout then, they may have restored some more.I believe I paid $60
  each for the powder coated frames.Not cheap,but I have restored some myself
  and know what a pita they can be when working with really rusty frames.
  good luck,
  &gt;&gt;
I remember a local guy who has this 66 bus he bought 25 years ago saying how 
he wanted nice frames, and found someone who had NOS ones, but the price was 
$50 a frame,  so he didn't get them, though it was too much
