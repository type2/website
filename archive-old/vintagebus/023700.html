Subject: FREE WESTY STUFF

I am last person to say, &quot;I've got too much VW stuff&quot;; but it has come
to that point again.

If you need an icebox, jumpseat, z-bed, long cabinet or yellow vinyl for
a walk-thru, it's yours.  That's right, FREE.  Sorry, no What-Not
Cabinet.

Everything needs something, but if you have basic wood skills and stuff
to work from, it will be a snap. I took three ('66 &amp; '67) interiors to
do my '67, so I've got some other stuff, too.  Smalls and demand items
will not be priced as well.

And if you want to give me something I can use, it will be happily
accepted.  My purpose is to get the stuff to a good home.

I'll take the stuff to one of those shipping store where you can have
them pack it and arrange payment for shipping.
