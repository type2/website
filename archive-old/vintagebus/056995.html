Subject: Re: [VB] Voltage regulator...

Measure the voltage at the battery terminals with the engine at over 2500
RPM.  It should be between 12.5 and 14V.

&gt; Could anyone out there give me any tips on testing a voltage regulator?
&gt; I think mine is overcharging my battery but Im not sure how to test it.
&gt; It a 1600cc with a GEN. The reason Im suspicious is the mystery water
&gt; under the battery after the bus is on for a while. It was a LOT of
&gt; liquid but the battery isn't low on water. I figured I would ask the all
&gt; knowing list if there was a quick check to be done for the regulator.
&gt; Also, is the general consensus of the list that a 6V gas gauge will work
&gt; in a 12V system?
&gt; Thanks as always!
