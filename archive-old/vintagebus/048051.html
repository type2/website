&lt;&lt; could the 1600 be too much power for 180mm clutch?? &gt;&gt;
Hi Isaiah,
Yup, that and anything other than a 9 spring 200mm pressure plate just seem 
to slip all too soon.
&lt;&lt;10 gallon tank...right?  and each 1/4 tank mark would represent 2.5 
gallons...right??&gt;&gt;  Actually we have been able to put in just over 11 
gallons if it is tipped just right in the 1955-66 tanks.     Eric&amp;Barb
