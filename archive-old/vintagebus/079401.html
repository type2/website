anything in the bentley tho I suppose I didnt look in the right section. Where is 
it? I looked in engine and elec sections. Anyway Idiot manual souded too 
confusing so I bought a dial indicator and welded a piece of metal strip to a mount 
bolt and secured the DI to it and got the .004 I was looking for. Its just 
never haven done it before and under pressure to get my vehicle back on the road. 
I hit the panic button often. I wish didnt have to but crisis maintenance is 
my life.  Thanks for the good info

Hi Ken,
Glad we could help!!  Section M-9, page 10.  Make sure to check the engine 
will turn over by hand after getting the shims set properly, but before 
installing the FW seal.  We had one engine so wornout that with enough shiming to get 
the endplay correct the engine locked at certain places while turning the FW 
by hand.  We had to go with thinner shims and just put up with the endplay 
being less, but still too much for reliabilty.  We rebuilt it a few months later 
due to this problem even though it still ran like a champ!
  Also make sure too check the additional info in section M-9, pages 2,3,4, 
for FW removal/installation.  We have found it is a good idea to polish any 
burrs or corrsion out of the FW seal bore in the engine with 400 or higher grit 
wet/dry sandpaper.  Once we replaced the FW seal three times in less than 6,000 
miles trying to get rid of a nasty FW seal oil leak that only went away after 
cleaning up this bore.
We do know how it can be needing to get it done now, but try to take your 
time and do the job correctly the first time!
