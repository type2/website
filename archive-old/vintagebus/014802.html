That can happen.  Disconneccting and reconnecting wires can change the
resistance of the connections, and a marginal fuse decides to give up.

In order of ease of checking....

First thing to check: did the lines to the fuel pump got reversed?
This can cause the dying.

Second thing: make sure you didn't pull the throttle cable too tight
when you reconnected it - it should sit all the way closed when no
one's touching the pedal.  This can cause the high idle.  Also check
that the choke didn't get rotated - sometimes they aren't tightened
down properly.

Third thing: depending on how much jostling the engine got, the float
in the carb might have gotten stuck (or some crud moved around in the
float bowl) such that fuel can seep in slowly, but not at the rate
that's needed to keep the engine running.  This can also cause the dying.

Fourth thing: it's possible you've developed a vacuum leak.  Any
rubber or other gasket-like things from the carbs to the cylinders
that looks cracked or broken off is suspect.
