Hello there, 

I'm selling 2 split window campers plus a parts bus, plus some parts!.
Too many  projects and not enough time to them all. I would like to sell
as a package deal but may separate.

1. 1967, walk-thru, complete near mint interior, original roof rack.
stored inside since late '70s. Not running, rusty rockers and misc areas
around the bottom. floors are good. no rust around any windows, doors
are all nice too.

2. 1966, walk thru,the interior is in pieces, I believe it's complete,
has a gas heater too. solid body that needs some work. not running and
in storage since mid '80s. 

Parts bus - low mileage euro '66 panel. runs great. VERY rusty but
perfect for transpant parts! 

Extra parts- bumpers, gas heater, interior bits, '67 engine, 14&quot;wheels,
front beam, lights, guages and more.

$2000, Maybe a little less.... 

I can help with delivery within a couple hundred miles.
