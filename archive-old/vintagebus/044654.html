Hi Tristan,
If it worked before then it sounds like you need to just clean it again.  
Having to clean a dirty carb two or even perhaps three times is not unusual!  
Expecially for the novice dealing with a carb that has not been cleaned since 
who knows when.  Did you also remove the brass accelerator nozzle from the 
top of the bottom half of the carb?  If so did you spay carb cleaner reverse 
wise through this nozzle?  Often this nozzle has to be cleared with a strand 
of copper filament from an electrical automotive wire.  Plus when installing 
this noozle you have to give it a tap to secure it in it's tapered hole in 
the carb body or risk the nozzle popping out, and down into the engine!  Also 
you need to align this nozzle so it just sprays between the carb throat, and 
the lower butter fly valve as it just opens.
