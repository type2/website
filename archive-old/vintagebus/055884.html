Subject: Looking for a door...

This may be a long shot... but does anyone have a real nice original paint
sealing wax red with a beige grey beltline - door they'd like to get rid of?
I don't need the top frame, handles, or anything like that, just the
original paint door.  It would be for a 61 bus....drivers side.  Faded
paint, rubbed through in spots its ok... but mine got smacked good before I
bought the bus and I'd like to match it to the rest of the bus.

Let me know...
Thanks!
Isaiah
