&gt; Ok here is the scoop. I am going to sandblast my 65 delux bus soon and I
would like some
&gt; tips on what I should do before and after. I have never sandblasted before
and I heard it &gt; is very messy.

First thing - don't use sand to remove the &quot;stuff&quot; like rust, previous coats
of paint, primer, etc.  Use either glass beads or walnut shells.  If you
can't find either of those (available at http://www.eastwoodco_dot_com). then
ask for &quot;non-angular&quot; media.

&gt; Some things I need to know...what should I coverup? When do I know the
rust is really
&gt; gone? What do I do after it is shiny clean metal?

Cover up anything you can...I would mask off any areas that you are not
specifically blasting.  Use an etching primer and then a guide coat to
figure out where there are low spots in the sheet metal.

&gt; I know I need to primer it, do I use primer from a spray can or paint
brush it on like you &gt; do when you paint your house.

Try not to use the brush on kind.  The rattle can is much more effective.
