Go easy it's my first time.  I've a sweet '65 camper that I just equipped
with a freshly built 1641cc unit but I also want to rejuvinate the tranny so
I'll be ready for springtime exploring.  60 mph is cool with me and I would
not mind getting a rebuilt stock tranny from So-Cal Imports or some such
place but is the conversion to IRS worth the effort or is it like opening a
can of worms.  My reduction gearboxes seem functionally sound and I hate
worms.  Has anyone faced this decision before and care to share their trials
and tribulations?

My first instinct is, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.     You are just
beginning in the world of split dom, so check it out a while before you decide
on major modifications, which such a conversion is.    Drive it, and think
about what you want out of it in terms of performace and hill climbing
ability.    It would probably be a good idea to get your bus tached out to see
what rpms you are doing at what speeds/gears.  Then go from there if you
really feel a tranny swap is what you want.  You would find it easier to
switch from a 4.37 R&amp;P (if that is what you have ) to a 4.12 (which I find
quite freeway practical) or a 3.88 R&amp;P (higher top end good for flat cruising
but less hill climbing ability) than to an IRS if what you want is a bit more
speed without rev the gajeebas out of the motor.

My 61 when I got it had a little nut tranny the PO said (whined a lot)   That
got dumped in favor of a $35 swap meet unit which turned out to be a 3.88
center section with 1.26 (big nut) reduction gears.  With a fresh stock 1600
SP it is quite the cruiser, for an old splitty at least, though certain hills
I have t o make sure I am at a good torque speed (55-69) or it will slow down
noticably.    My 65 westy had a 4.12 R&amp;P with big nut RGBs, and was geared a
bit lower, so I went a bit slower on the freeway (closer to 55 than 60) and
was better on hills.  I would have left it, had not it started popping out of
gear.   Replaced with a 3.88, which is not as nice as in the 61, which has a
fresh motor.   The 65's motor has many miles on it, who knows how many, and is
a bit less that perky anymore.       And has a wierd oil leak now, thoughit
has served quite well.   To get a faster bus, you really need to put a lot
into it, and i still say if it aint broke, dont beat yourself on the head.
My 59 truck (whic may be sold  :(   has a little nut (1.39 RGs) with I think a
4.37 R&amp;P, and is low geared.  I can haul stuff up hills like you  wouldn't
believe, but I aint going 60 mph, keep it about 52, that's the sweet spot.
Taching it notwithstanding, I like 52 in the truck on the freeway, other
drivers, however, may not.  Sucks to be them.      (geez, what a b&amp;tch I am).
I like the slow truck.  I am not sure I would go with a 3.88 R&amp;P next time.
Anyway, a tranny swap just isnt so fun, you may want to wait until it is
warmer, then decide.
