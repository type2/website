Subject: re: powder coating brake drums

Hello Kevin and list
I have all the drums on my 60 ragtop powdercoated Ford Grabber Blue to match 
the floor pan.  In the short amount of time and distance I've driven the car 
the brakes have always held up under heat and stopping. Powdercoating is by 
far the best finish to have for drums. Of course, I really don't have a lot 
of miles on the car to back up the differences in non-powdercoated vs. 
powdercoated drums. I've never felt a difference though.


Good luck,
Dave Barnes
