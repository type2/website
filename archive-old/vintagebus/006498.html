&lt;&lt;  If you
 &gt;have a bus that came with a tunnel case you don't the nose cone is the
 &gt;same. &gt;
Don't the mid 59 to 63 front tranny mounts have slightly smaller studs? Would 
this cause the tranny to slip up and down a bit during hard driving/shifting, 
or would tighting the bolts down hold it in place? &gt;&gt;

I've seen this discussion go round before. Has anyone gotten their local machinist / pal to make sleeves for the mounting studs? I can't imagine why this would not work.
