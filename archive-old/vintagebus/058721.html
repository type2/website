Subject: Bug-O-Rama and 40HP

Good day at the Sacramento Bug-O-Rama sunday. Bug-O-Rama isn't your upscale 
bus meet and I didn't even bother to look for the outfitted ambulance or the 
perfect puck. My day was all about the swap meet, I went there with the 
intent to sell some odd accumulated stuff and buy a rebuildable engine with 
the proceeds. Struck out bad on the selling, still can't believe no-one 
wanted the bug tow hitch, thought that was golden but it seems I was wrong. 
End of the day and everyone is packing up, I've only got $50. Enough for an 
engine? You bet. For a whole $15 I got a 1963 40HP engine missing fan 
shroud, generator and carb, I can turn it over by hand with no clunks or 
grinds, crankcase still full of oil not water. I blew the rest on a pair of 
late RGBs with extra crown gears and fulcrum plates, 12V 9-prong boxes, 6V 
9-prong boxes, fusebox covers, and much much more... So much for getting rid 
of stuff, but I am happy and excited about my new underdog engine.
I don't have a Westy or a barndoor so my knowledge here is a bit limited, 
but I was given what is supposedly a Westy closet rod and a barndoor mirror 
arm. The closet rod is about 9 inches long and nicely made with mildly 
decorative little end castings. The supposed barndoor mirror arm is thicker 
and less severely bent than those on later splits, the mirror end is cut 
thinner and has a hole drilled through it, the hinge end is cut thinner and 
threaded at the very end. If you will put them on your bus and not ebay, 
they are yours for the asking.
