Subject: center pin shift rod hell

This weekend I worked on getting my front beam out to
replace the center pin/swing lever bushings.
Everything was going smoothly until it came time to
take out the front shift rod. Snapped the screw heads
off the coupler in about 2 seconds each. Drilled them
out, but still no dice. Pulled out the angle grinder
and ground away half of the coupler, still no dice.
won't even be twisted. So now i guess I'm down to
cutting it. I'm sure I've mangled the Front shift rod,
and I'm worried about the rear one... My question: Is
it possible to pull the rear shift rod out the front,
therby avoiding pulling the engine and tranny? Boy, I
sure hope so.
Also, I know there were some changes to the front
shift rod, but will any year rear shift rod do the
trick? My bus is a later '60. Thanks, y'all.
