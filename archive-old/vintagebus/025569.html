Here's a story for ya...My wife and I were out walking when I noticed a
very nice Vanagon GL camper parked in someone's yard. We crossed the
street and looked in the window and inside is a sign &quot;For Sale 1988
Camper 570 miles&quot; along with the phone number. On the passenger window
was the original sticker, ($26,K +).
I called the number and a retired man answered, we made arrangements to
meet, and at the appointed time, my wife, myself and the seller got
together.
Story goes that he bought it for a companion and himself to camp in and
she died shortly after he made the purchase. He didn't have the heart to
use it, and rolled it into the garage under a tarp. Ten years goes by
and he decides to sell, rolls it out, and I walk by. We settle on
$12,300.00 cash. This thing is perfect, exactly what is looks like, a
ten year old camper that's never been slept in, the refrigerator still
has the racks and accessories in the factory plastic bags.
I leave for a business trip the following day with the understanding
that I would settle up when I get back... I return, get in touch with
the owner, tell him I have the money lined up and we make an appointment
to do the deal. Everythings cool...
At 3:00 pm I walk across town, check in hand for 12.3K ready to drive
off.
The old guy's son is there when I arrive for Father's Day dinner.
We walk out on the porch and I ask him to open up the camper so that I
can check on a couple of things. He says &quot;My son has a neighbor, who is
a VW collector who just returned from California. He says I can sell
this camper for LIST PRICE on the internet because they're just snapping
them up like crazy out there&quot;. (Where has Mr. Big Talker been for 10
f***ing years??).
I said, &quot;but we have a deal&quot;.....but no dice, this old guy who doesn't
know the internet from a hairnet is going to &quot;make big money&quot; selling
his Westy online. Never mind that he's double-dealing one of his
neighbors (me).
My first love is splitties, but this was too good to pass up, besides, I
could see cruising to VW shows and campouts with DBG with both buses,
not to mention a camper when Osterbus goes down for the nose transplant.

Moral of the story.....when you see something you want, buy it. work out
the details later, make whatever modifications to your plans you have to
but drag it home RFN
(right f***ing now). Before some big talking hand-jobber comes along and
queers the deal.
