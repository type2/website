Subject: bus manual best source also old ads

I need to buy a shop manual for my 67 bus- simple
Is there just one shop manual, because some wording of advertising gets 
me confusedthat there may be 2.
what is the going price? from whom
any body have an extra.
I have a catalog that lists photo copies for 20$-might I consider that?
I guess you get my drift
Does any ony know of a source for old advertisements-I have a centerfold 
ad with an elephant in a bus- looking for more of this type stuff
thanks frank
