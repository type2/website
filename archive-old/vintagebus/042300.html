Subject: RMM Gas Cap WARNING!

Hey folks.

Just pulled the once perfect ten gallon tank out of the 66.  The poor
thing is more like an 8 gallon tank now.  good thing I fill at 100 miles!!
(bad sender)

I'd bought a new gas cap, as the original leaked (even after I put a new
gasket on..).  ended up with two, but that is a different story!

RMM # 211 201 551 (Gas cap, non-locking, 60mm 56-67 T2)

I noticed at the first fill that this cap did .not. vent!  Opened the cap,
and had to pull it off, then listen to the tank expand.....

After a few times of this, I had to pop a hole in th cap (couldnt find the
original cap...in the bus .somewhere...) so this wouldnt happen anymore.

Pulled the engine today, to put in a 15gallon tank......and found the
once-perfect original tank to be CRUSHED! :(

I'll be in contact with my RMM rep monday about this, as well as some
other problems. (12v dash bulbs packaged (and ordered) as 6v....cracked
(and now leaking) axle boots, after only a few thousand miles...(6k, to be
real close.)

later....david
