Subject: Re: hooking up radio 6v to 12v

&gt;I have the battery out of the bus right now, so i hooked up the inverter
&gt;up as per the diagram, and hooked my voltmeter up to it-i get a reading
&gt;of 13.75V being output. Is this ok, normal? or too high-would it fry
&gt;my radio?

That's fine.  It'll drop a little when loaded by the radio.  The system
voltage in a &quot;12 V&quot; car ranges from about 10 volts (cranking) to about
15 volts (high engine revs, light electrical load).

&gt;Also does the distance from the fuse to the inverter, or the distance from
&gt;inverter to radio matter, as long as I use a heavy gauge wire?

No.  Use at least 16 gauge wire for both runs.  14 is better and 12 is
probably as big as you need to go for the distances in a Bus.  If you
put the inverter far from the fuse box, put the inline fuse near the
fuse box so it will blow if the long wire shorts out.

&gt;The inverter had a 5 amp inline fuse between the battery positive and the
&gt;inverter input positive. The diagram calls for an 8 AMP / 3 AG inline fuse.
&gt;I assume using the 5 amp is just a little safer.

The 5 amp is probably what some PO had lying around.  It will also limit
the inverter to less than 2.5 amps output.  For your purposes it's probably
best to run the original 8 amp fuse.

&gt;And what does the 3 AG mean?

Number 3 Automobile Glass.  That's the spec for the physical size of the
fuse.
