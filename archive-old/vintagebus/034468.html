Subject: Ebay BD
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I'm not sure if it was mentioned, but there is a BD on ebay right now.  I 
know how some of you de-test (sp?) the site, but want a  BD.  It was at $2175 
when I last looked.  The seller mentioned it had been up previously but the 
seller backed out.  Anyone know what the selling price was last go around?  
Anyone see it personally?
