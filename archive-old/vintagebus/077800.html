NOT IN THE BUS! A friend of mine did that back in 89 to his 68. He had
all the right stuff, a chunk of clutch cable, a piece of clothes hanger,
a brass hammer, and some type of spray on cleaning fluid and a propane
torch. He pulled his apron and his muffler and started working away at
it, but at some point he decided a little heat was required. The only
problem was that his rubber fuel line didn't like it very much. I helped
him pull what was left of the motor and tranny the next weekend and
after sand blasting and repainting over the next two years and replacing
a lot of rubber pieces he had his van running again.

Advice, pull the engine and work the intake outside the vehicle and off
the motor. It will also give you a chance to inspect the underside for
rust holes and replace or weld if necessary.

Hello Andy    I use a combination of the cable on the drill and heating
the
tube and tapping on it not too hard with a small hammer.  Mark Dearing
