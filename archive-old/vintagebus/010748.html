Put a trailer hitch on wife's Pathfinder on Thursday in anticipation of
purchasing a 1957 Kombi from Doug in Longview.  Doug was advertising it on
VintageBus_dot_com without pictures and email.  So, I had called him to get
description and price the week before, it sounded good on the phone and he
wanted $1500.00 for it.

On Friday we took off early for Portland, a 5-hour drive from Bellingham in
the Pathfinder, which is a great car for pulling Volkswagens home.  Meet
Doug at his house in Longview and took a look at the Kombi.  Basically, it
had been broken down for years, parked in his driveway, no 4th gear on the
transmission, would start if only he had a battery -- ya right.  The inside
had 62 Westy Camper gear and smelled of must.  In fact Doug was frantically
unloading stuff from the Bus, since he had been using it as a storage shed.
Doug told me he had to sell it because he was getting married -- which made
for a good laugh later when his wife came out go in a brand new Land Rover
and left for work.  Dougies, rolling eyesore storage shed had to go.  Matter
of fact, my wife gave me the evil eye when I offered him $500 for it, which
he refused.  I just can't pay more then $500 for a bus that doesn't run.  He
should of given it to me to haul off and got his marriage started out on the
right foot. 

Anyways, got some pictures for the group, please contact Doug directly at:
(360) 414 9411.  I am sure someone will see something in the pictures and
say that alone is worth $500, however if you do buy it for parts I would
like to get the driver's side door from you.

Spent Saturday at the Oregon Beach and showed up bright and early to the PIR
event.  Very typical Bug-In with racing, air and water cooled, swap meet and
show.  There was only one 70 series bus in the vintage type II area -- so
anyone rolling up could of got a trophy, and just a couple buses in the
custom category.  There was no 50's parts for buses at the swap meet,
however picked up a NOS front door handle, emblem for the front, and a NOS
mirror.  Back home by 3:00 pm.
