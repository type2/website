Ya59s got full width benches.  maybe it was a PO installed thing?  ANyway 
they only made one version of splitty 1/3 2/3 seats so it should fit-   the 
drivers side slides on a track, right? With the slide release lever on the 
right front of the seat, a lever.

 59 buses never got a 1/2 2/3, they got full bench or walk through.

 &lt;&lt;  After months of riding in
  discomfort Ive finally found some suitable donor seats for my 64 sundial
  (1/3 2/3).  My question is whether they will fit.  They are coming from a 59
  (1/3 2/3).  Does anyone know if i'll have a problem with this.  &gt;&gt;
