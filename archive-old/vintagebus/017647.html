Subject: 67 Westfalia light only on with engine on?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Finally I have all exterior lights, blinkers and
high/low beams working.  My westfalia lights will only
turn on if the engine is on, probably not wired
correctly to the last fuse which is for the interior
lights.  Looking at the the westy parts manual it
indicates a fuse towards the back of the bus, could
this be my culprit. So close but yet so far. Also
checked by flicking the rear interior light switch by
the steering wheel, no luck, does work for the normal
rear light! What a blast it was driving to the bugout
this past weekend.  Love driving my spitty.

Thanks,
Patrick
