Subject: suv's suck
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have been trying to ignore the subject after my first rant.  It is my
number one pet-peeve however and I cant resist posting this great website
about Stupid Ugly Vehicles.

http://poseur.4x4_dot_org/

I promise not to post any more SUV stuff unless provoked.  :-)

well im not going to rant but as my daily driver i use a ford crewcab,8' bed 
4by4, deisel.
yes its big, yes its a pain to park sometimes,
what i hate the most is turning radius to go around the corner after ordering 
buger at mikiy d's.
but i drive what i like and what i need.
i use this truck everyday and do put it off road.
just 2 months ago in a rian and ice and snow storm in the hills of upstate NY
picking up my 64 parts bus with a 18 foot trailer, i had a fun time getting 
back on the road.

people all the time wave thier arms at me at stop lights because they dont 
like the sunburn on the back of thier neck.  ( hey i didnt biuld this thing)
i do like the lights when impaints as*%oles think they can illegally pass 
just to gain a few feet ( oh sorry that should be 23  feet)  as soon as they 
pass and cut me off i take great pleasure in pulling right up to them at the 
light.
( it eases tension and is quite relaxing)

as to its size if they made a bigger one with six doors and another bech seat 
i woud buy it , only because that is what i need ( more room).

im at this time considering trading it in for a ford fullsize fulllenth van, 
but you gotta see the look on the salesmans face when i tell um i want it 
with 4 wheel drive and a deisel engine,tow package all in upholstered 
removeable seat package on the e-350 frame. (1 ton ).
