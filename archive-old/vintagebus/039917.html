Sorry list... this is a 1962.  Have pink and current registration.  This is 
a bus in the early phases of restoration.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

A family emergency could very well necessitate the sale of my beloved
15-Window bus.  Located in California in SF Bay area.  Very little rust 
(cargo floor by door only, small), body in very good condition, corner 
windows, rear seat, rear seat lugage bar, bay middle seat, motor &amp; trans 
(cond unknown), towable.  Have a recently acquired eberspacher bn4 that may 
be negotiable.  Anyone seriously interested? In about an hour I will be 
going mobile and contact will be sporadic as I unravel this mess so let me  
know.  This really sucks...
