Try your Lowes and Sears stores.  I've been pricing MIG's and found a 110
model at Sears for $300 that comes with the gas regulator.  I noticed at one
of the Lowes stores here, they now have a Campell Hausfiled model for $309
that comes with a regulator and flip up mask.  One more source that came
recommended to me was from autobodystore_dot_com.  It's Asro that the site
recommends and folks on the discussion group seem to like.  The 110 model
sells for $309 and the 130 for $369(http://www.autobodystore_dot_com/astro1.htm)
.  Hope this helps some.

Dave
