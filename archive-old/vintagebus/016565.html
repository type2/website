Hey i thought i would throw this out. how about a split window bus simulator 
i would buy it. It would be a real joy for us busless or our  bus is going 
under a resto guys(and girls). So is it probable? Is it insane? I know some 
of you are programmers I know this is a friday topic but hey we got to have 
fun. &quot;(almost pretty fly for a bus guy Kirin Jacobsen)&quot;
