What Gene Berg meant was and is still true.  Volkswagen made the best oil cooler

for VWs.  Gene was one of the very few people who actually did tests to find out

if something worked or not.  The rest of the VW idustry just marketed their
stuff (usually copies).

In the case of the oil coolers, how cool does an engine run when it has only the

block off plate over the stock cooler location and an external cooler?  It runs
hotter, right?  How bout those idiots that run the external cooler bolted to the

back of the fan shroud?  Hotter again.  In most cases, people just follow the
band wagon and don't bother checking what actually works.  'You can't run a
2180, it'll burn up on the street.'  I've been running a 2332cc motor in my
stock bus for almost a year now, runs great at 190 degrees.

If you buy Gene Berg's technical information book, you will see what kind of
testing he actually did.  I consider him to be one the best VW aftermarket
'engineers' of the 20th century.

For example, he did a test on running scoops on the side of a bus.  He tried to
make sure the outside temperature was always the same when he did his tests, but

he kept getting different readings.  After 'fine-tooth-combing' his results, he
found that it made a difference whether or not the vent wings were open or not.
The amount of air getting in through the scoops changed depending on whether the

vent wings were open or not!

Some people think he was crazy, maybe you have to be to be in this industry.
But he did do some incredible work while he was with us.

&gt; Everything I have ever read from Berg Enterprises says that remote oil
&gt; coolers are evil and that the stock cooler should never be removed. What is
&gt; up with this?  Have we been fooled?
