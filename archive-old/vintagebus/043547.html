Just a couple of things on points in the new micro discussion.

Some people have said &quot;Look at Oldsmobile...you don't want VW to go
out of business like them, do you?&quot;  Since at least the late 1960s,
Oldsmobile has just been one *brand* of General Motors.  Car-industry
people have been saying for a few years that GM needed fewer brands.
GM is not going to go out of business any time soon.

On &quot;support your old stuff&quot;...Other makes do this markedly better.
Ford has a division, SVO/Ford Motorsport, that sells performance
goodies through Ford dealerships.  You can get a catalog at the
parts desk of any US Ford dealer.  Some of the parts are genuine
Ford and some are rebadged aftermarket parts, but the point is,
the stuff is available.  While there is an emphasis on the later
models (since the Fox-body Mustang in the early 80s), they still
sell stuff that will bolt on to your '64 1/2 Mustang.

It can be good business to support your older gear.  General
Electric, who I used to work for, had a program called &quot;Quick
Fix&quot; for appliance parts.  Basically it was &quot;Appliance Repair
for Dummies.&quot;  They sold manuals written for the non-serviceman
and parts packaged attractively with full instructions.
All of the goods went on a display with a lighted sign that
was usually placed at the *back* wall of the appliance store.

When Joe Consumer's appliance is broken, this is what he can
do:

1. ignore it and/or stop using appliance
2. fix it
   a. service call
   b. himself
3. get another appliance

You can't do much about 1) and if Joe calls the factory service
for 2a) then you still make money.  The Quick Fix really addressed
2b) and 3).  Either you got to make money from selling the parts
to the customer (hopefully it's also good PR for you) or they buy
or they buy a new appliance....like one of the ones they had to
walk past to get to the parts display.  :)

I don't know if GE still has the program but it was very popular
with the dealers and with consumers.  The consumers liked being
able to do things themselves and save a little money, and the
dealers liked it because they moved more parts AND more new
appliances.

To bring all this back on topic, what if you could still get a range
of ACVW parts down at your dealership?  VW would make money on the
parts...plus get people walking by all those shiny new ones on the
showroom floor.  Instead, you have things like a current VW salesman
talking trash about the old air-cooled models *AT AN AIRCOOLED VW
CAR SHOW*.  I personally witnessed this.  Guess which dealership
(and to some extent, brand) got mentally crossed off my list of
future new-vehicle purchase locations?

Anyway, that's my $0.02.
