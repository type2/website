Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome report, more 15window damage, pics (long)

Oh, it really isn't that serious Rick. Pretty much good natured fun. There
are still enough splits out here that we can be exclusive in some of the
shows, but there isn't any animosity. I even made my new towbar so it can
tow a &quot;fat chick&quot; if needs be. Not bugs though, those things are nasty.....

&gt; It's a real shame the split and bay guys can't get together on the west
&gt; coast.
