A cell phone is a window that lets stress into a place it doesn't belong. Professional drivers are trained and keep the conversation terse. Idiot caller/drivers put more thought in their conversation than their driving, usually during a commute in traffic. Yes, there were hysterical warnings about radios and cup holders and ashtrays, that doesn't mean loud music, spilled soft drinks and dropped butts no longer cause accidents. The level of distraction is too high and constant with cell phones. I have one, but use it responsibly, and that's what I expect of everybody else on the road. 

Bus clone site... http://www.fk1000_dot_de/index.htm One of these was FS at OCTO last June, I had never seen the deluxe or doublecab models. Is that a Puck? Dormobile top? 

www.google_dot_com will now translate foreign language sites. Enter &quot;Ford FK 1000&quot; and choose &quot;translate this site&quot; in the results. Cool, fast and sometimes funny. 

OT... I'm selling my nearly stock '74 Thing. Pmail for details if you're interested.
