For anyone interested.  The auction on my '53 ended on Sunday PM, I was 
telephoned by the buyer on Monday AM, and had payment in full in certified 
funds in my hands on Tuesday AM.  They will pick it up with in 1-1/2 weeks.  
As a seller that is perfection.  While I am as patriotic as anyone (8 years 
military service, Eagle Scout, etc.) I have got to say I would gladly do 
business with these guys again.  Sure I would love to see the bus stay in my 
home town but in reality Los Angeles or Tokyo I will probably never see it 
again.  As long as it is going to an enthusiast I'm okay with it...and I 
don't think anyone would part with $8K on a whim, it takes an enthusiast.
