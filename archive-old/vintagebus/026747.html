Subject: Re: [VB] and the saga continues...

An intermittant electrical problem is often a capacitor, which of
course, is what a condensor is. The symptom is usually that the device
works well until it gets warm and then the component loses value. But, a
coil can also be intermittant from moisture or vibration. And volkswagen
coils are noted for this, because the high heat in the engine
compartment plays havoc with the insulation. I found this out the hard
way, when one rainy night I had the misfortune of being stuck in my vw
over night with my sister, her husband and my first class bitch of a
first wife. My sister and I still get a laugh over it, but at the time
it wasn't funny at all.
