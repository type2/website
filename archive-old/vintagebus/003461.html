I took one of the original screws with me to the chain hardware stores in my
area and found some that were close enough to try at Yard Birds here in
Northern California.  The flat head is similar and the thread matches but
the screw is slightly longer.  A little bit unsure, I bought enough for one
window (_at_$.04 ea) and tried them.  They fit, so I bought more for the other
3 windows I was replacing.  If anyone is interested, I'll get the screw
specs.
