Hi again Roger and Trudi, saw this and wanted to say.....

&gt;There is a
&gt;&quot;clunk&quot; in the steering when first starting to turn the wheel, probably
&gt;a tie rod end, but haven't located the source, yet. 

A common problem on old busses, and possibly a cause for the clunk, is 
whats known as the drag link. Look under the bus while someone turns the 
wheel. If the bar that goes from the steering box moves vertically at 
all you need to replace the bushings. You will visually be able to see 
it move up and down.
Thought I would let you know! One of the first things I had replaced on 
my front end of my 63.
Jason S.
