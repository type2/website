FWIW, the wing window is the same shape 53-67.  Also left is same as right. 
 (Not sure if piano hinge- the 52 &amp;earlier- has the same glass though.)

&lt;&lt; Anyway... 
 &gt; does anyone have wing window glass for the passenger
 &gt; side of a 63 panel??
 
 If a '66 wing glass will fit, I have one I give you
 for the shipping. Someone let me know if it will fit.
