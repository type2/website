They can but they won't unless you are the currently registered owner of the
vehicle.  They usually ask for a copy of your current registration (since
you live in another state than CA).

Also remember than CA dumps their records after 6 years now, which sucks.

I got in touch with a pervious owner of a Binz but he didn't have any of the
serial number info or remember who he sold it to.  Does anyone know if the
CA
DMV can/will look up information on a car based on a previous owner?
Appreciate any help offered.

Thanks,
Dan
