Hmmmm....thats odd since I tried to get info on buying the complete bus and 
all I got was the run around. I hate it when you ask specific questions and 
all you get are a couple little word answeres that dont answer what you 
asked. Like when you ask if the complete vechile is for sale and the answer 
you get is that its a total piece of rust. Dont know about ya'll, but that 
boggles my mind.
                                                                   Thats 
twice I have gotten a run around from someone in NC.
