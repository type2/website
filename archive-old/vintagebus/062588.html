Subject: Re: [T2] Syn oil again

[...]
A straight weight synthetic had actually been on wish lists for a 
while.  About two years ago there was a discussion at one of the 
meetings i attended on new merchandise for the flaps iworked at that 
time.  The vendor rep from mobile stated that strange as seemed that 
there actually were some difficulties in blending a straight weight in 
synthetics.  Looks like the hurdle has been beaten.
Love it.. i definately have a use for the stuff as soon as it hits the 
street here.

&gt;    As I have stated I have switched to Mobil 1 15-50 full syn oil. I 
&gt; just
&gt; checked my oil after over 2500 miles of driving and didn't use a drop! I
&gt; would usually use 1/2 guart of dyno in the same distance.
&gt;   I just came from Wally World where I was getting some lights for my 
&gt; new
&gt; trailer http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/pix/42250.jpg and saw that 
&gt; Mobil
&gt; now makes a straight 30 weight full syn oil now, all the air cooled 
&gt; people
&gt; must have gave them an earfull, so they decided to make it.
