Thanks to all for the help with the trans oil filling question.

Another one.  Did a '59 bus ever come with a straight shifter or were they
all curved back at the base?  On the front section of the shifter tube where
the shifter went, did that have a slot in the front or not.  I'm afraid I
have a slapped together front shifter tube.  The one I have doesn't have the
slot in front for the pin on the shifter.  If anyone has a correct one
they'd be will to part with let me know.

Doug
