I also was caught in the SOTO dilemma when i was back east. I had sent
money for membership and ordered a T-shirt. After about four months i
never received the T-shirt or newsletter. I finally got out west and
talked to him at the 94 kelley park show and he said it was a mix up.  I
finally got my shirt after two years and received my newsletter. Well
after two newsletters i received no more, back to SOTO norm. I again
talked to him when i went to the SOTO meet in 95 and have been receiving
the newsletter since. M y only complaint is that $20 per SOTO member
goes to him and all the money made from the annual show. From what he
says the number of $5 attendance fees raffles and tee shirts he sells he
we should have a bitchin newsletter but all we get is a two page photo
copied newsletter. I have no bad feelings towards Dave Heard but if he
is going to run the club and take everyone's money he should provide a
decent product. I think it has become the norm if you are out west to
become a SOTO member, but personally i think you don't get anything from
it except for giving money to him...I speak as a recent east coast
transplant who was ripped off of two years membership and i know of
countless others. I will never send money again to SOTO until they get
some kind of organization where the money input by members is accounted
for. I am also a member of the Arizona bus club and in every newsletter
they list the funds coming in and going out and have elected officers
not one person collecting the cash. I just think the SOTO members if
they care about the club should restore it to its former good status
with good shows of the members not a money making scheme, it used to be
a bus event not a cash raising fund. If anyone wants to start an
alternative show i would support it just because it is about BUSSES not
the money you can make from enthusiasts. I know it takes money to put on
a show, but lets gets real, he is getting rich off us bringing our cool
old busses to the shows.

Well enough of my bitch it  is  your choice and as  long as people send
him money it will continue. The never ending SOTO dilemma.

An AZ bus club member and long time VW fan, just my two cents worth. I
wish he would respond to our concerns since he glady takes our money,
and does not have to account for it at all.......I will continue to
support the Jerome Jamboree but next year it is the classic and no SOTO
show, lets start the alternative show so it is back to busses not the
DAVE HEARD CLUB.
