Subject: Re: [VB] What a difference 4 years makes

I guess my short term memory is shot, I don't remember what you all are talking about. I remember a thread that I posted in that ticked a few folks off but that's about it. Something about a cow and pasture, that was taken the wrong way but all is forgiven with the sharing of a brew.
