Subject: broken exaust stud

Only sure fire one ive seen and been pretty amazed by was a machine shop by 
us that
we take these probelems to who welds a bolt onto the end of the stub, blast 
its with
pb blaster and turns it off like it wasnt even an issue. Of course when we 
tried it ourselves
it didnt go quite that smooth. Worth the $15 he charges us to do it. ;)

Now tomorrow I get to remove two broken studs where the exhaust bolts broke
in the heads.  Both are sticking out about 3/16&quot; from the head.  Any sure
fire tips?   (1600 T1 engine)
