The Volunteer Bug Jam will be held at Chilhowee Park again, i
believe... but am not %100 sure...
	The best way to get there from I-75... from Fla, take 75 N to
Knoxville...(south of Knoxville, 75 and 40 become one) Follow I-640 East
(exit 385 from 40/75) until you come to Interstate 40 again. Get on I-40
East and get off at the second exit for Rutledge Pike. (11-W, going
south). Rutledge Pike will merge with Magnolia Ave a little bit past the
Shoney's. Down 2 or 3 blocks, Chilhowee Park will be on the left AND the
right. Last year, they had it on the left side, so be in the left lane,
I believe you'll be turning onto Beaman St. to get to the BugJam lot...

That'll at least get you there...
