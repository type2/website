Subject: Re: [VB] what thickness Shims to use?

----- Original Message ----- 
&gt;   To prevent overheating we would suggest installing an oil temp gauge,
oil
&gt; pressure gauge.  Never let the oil temp go above 220F and preferable keep
temp
&gt; between 160-210F.

If the concern is watching head temps, then a head temp gauge should be
used. Watching oil temps is not watching head temps. Run oil temp and head
temp gauges simutaniously, and you'll see 350 degree head temps are easily
attainable with oil temps not yet reaching 120. In fact, if you run an
external oil cooler in addition to the stock oil cooler, you can quite
easily run extreme head temps without even getting oil temps over 200
degrees.

With the sending unit under the spark plug, you are monitoring combustion
chamber material temps (i.e. the valve seats!).
General rule is 400 is getting hot and you should slow down, 425 is when
valve seats can start to drop. Normal highway head temps would be 350 to
380-ish.
