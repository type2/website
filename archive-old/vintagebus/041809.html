&gt; I've never seen a solid-state flasher &quot;relay&quot;.  I would expect that to
&gt; be the case with such a beast, however.  Brand name?  Part number?
&gt; Vendors known to carry them?  Anything along those lines would be
&gt; helpful.

I've never seen one, but it seems a natural application.  Teh only bad
thing about solid-state switching is that there is a voltage drop
involved.  This would be no concern with LEDs, but with incandescent bulbs
it could be a problem.

It wouldn't be too hard to homebrew a flasher with a 555 timer IC.  If you
wanted to get fancy you could have a turn signal with long and short
flashes, like:

...-  .--      ...-  .--      ...-  .--

Hmmm, another project!
