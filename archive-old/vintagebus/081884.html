Subject: Re: [VB] bumpers for '66 Bus

Hi Gloria,
Try Thesamba_dot_com, click on the classfieds, and then click on search.  Try 
looking for &quot;Bus Bumper&quot; and &quot;Sundial&quot;.  You are looking for he 1965-67 &quot;pointy&quot; 
bumper if you want to be correct.  There are repro bumpers out there and from 
what we saw of these years ago they were made of thinner metal and not welded 
as throughly as the originals.
  You can also advertise for parts or even an interior.
  Since you are in CA you have lots of VW swap meets happening around you.  
Where you can go to and get parts possibly for very little and save on 
shipping.  You can see a list of events at Vintagebus_dot_com.
  Cool to hear you have had your bus that long!
Eric&amp;Barb
