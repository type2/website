Subject: [VB] re:roof rack damage&gt;3/4s or Full-length?

For the longest time I personally &quot;assumed&quot; what I now know are the
three-fourths (3/4s) racks were &quot;full length&quot;.
What I have for sale (only mentioned for the photo example) is the 3/4ths.
To be full-length the rack should and will span the entire roof with the
exception of the very extremes of the roof. I have no first hand knowledge of
the full-length racks. I have never owned one. Many friends have or still own
them.

Frankly, I have no idea what the current running prices are for the true
full-length crowfooted clamp racks. Yes, they are cool but, for me, I never saw
one at a price that I could afford at the time(s) that I was shopping for one.
The 3/4 racks that I have owned ran empty most of the time anyway.

My intention in selling my rack is to clear the garage and assist someone who
needs/wants one at a fair price.

Good luck in everyone's search.
