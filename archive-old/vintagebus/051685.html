&gt; Wow, and I couldn't hardly give away a fairly dry, running, driving
&gt; '55 single out here in California with new brakes!

&gt; &gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; &gt; A friend of our's up in the Sea-Tac area (Between Seattle and Tacoma.)
&gt; &gt; is selling his 1957 SC for $3,000.00.  He bought a few years ago from
out
&gt; &gt; East of the Cascades where it is dry and VWs tend to be fairly rust
free.  It
&gt; &gt; runs and he has had the bed blasted and painted to kill off the surface
rust.
