Subject: Turn signal switch part deux

Okay I'm a little confused on what kind of turn signal switch I need.  I
found a description online (wolfsberg west) that states &quot;TURN SIGNAL
SWITCH, Bus, 1966-1967, for US delivery cars with all red taillights,
inludes high low beam switch.&quot;  My High/Low beam switch is located on
the left side of my speedometer housing, is this also the work of some
PO?  Does this mean if I want to go back to original that I need a new
speedometer housing as well?  I hope that this is not the case, the dash
board has already been cut to allow a rectangular (DIN chassis) radio,
was this high/low beam also an addition?  If I am repeating myself let
me say that I am sorry, it is because of the late hour and the whiskey
sours (sorry about the unfortunate rhyme).  Please let me know what is
going on with my busses switch, my darling Clementine needs some TLC
(that is the name I gave her on my maiden voyage with her, that in
itself is an interesting story that I will relate later if anyone is
interested.)
