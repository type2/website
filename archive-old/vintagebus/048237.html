Hi Brad,
White smoke when the engine is cold is just water vapor condensing.

&lt;&lt;Oh,the choke, but I have that adjusted. Its an electromagnetic (i think).
Has a
little coil inside a housing, end of coil has circle that you put into a
little knob on housing, and spinning it opens and closes the choke, then you
tighten it at the correct tightness.&gt;&gt;
Well the choke is not electromagnetic is thermally activated due to
electricity going through it and heating the spiral coil it flows through
making this spiral coil flex bigger, and smaller when cooled back down.

&lt;&lt;Would the choke really cause this? Seems strange to me.&gt;&gt;
Well if the knob that controls the choke butterfly valve is not properly
engaged in that spiral coil allowing it possibly to flop back and forth
changing the fuel air mixture and RPM.
