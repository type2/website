&gt;Currently have a 1600 dual port getting about 22 mph.

Sounds like a transaxle replacement is definitely in order, if that's in
4th gear.  The transaxle you have now must have been rebuilt by a VW
tractor-pull fan.  :)

&gt;Does anybody know where a new tank can be obtained,

BFY Obsolete, in their #6 catalog (probably a few years old), lists a
211 201 055 B, -67 Transporter Fuel Tank, at $115.  I don't know if
they still carry it or if the price has changed.  Bus Depot's 2000
catalog has the same part number at $90.  Standard disclaimer; I
don't get money from BFY Obsolete or Bus Depot.  There may be other
suppliers.

&gt;and do you think it is a good idea to go back to stock?

If there were no other considerations, I would pick the stock part,
just because I like to keep it stock.  You might pick differently.

Of course there are always other considerations.  I would say a big
one is: how do you plan to drive this Bus?  Lots of road trips?  If
so the bigger later tank may be handy.  Around town?  Then the stock
tank is fine.  If you don't like smog, the later tank will have vent
fittings that you can plumb to a charcoal canister.  Even if you don't
care about smog, you'll have to do something with these fittings (like
just plugging them) if you install the later tank.
