Yeah, I knew it was you.  You call it rude I called it sarcasm.  Now, the RUDE thing to
do was to post this publicly.  The graceful thing for you to do would have been to post
to me privately.  Public subject over.

&gt; Steve,
&gt;
&gt; Since we are so busy with the red ink, I should point out that it was a
&gt; person or _persons_ who earlier scolded you. &quot;People&quot; is not plural for
&gt; &quot;person.&quot;
&gt; By the way, I was that person, and I told you in personal mail I thought
&gt; you had been a bit rude when you publicly corrected a fellow listee's
&gt; sentence structure. At least Thom has the grace and humor to do it
&gt; lightly.
