Hi Joe,
If you are getting enough oil pressure to keep out the oil pressure light 
then you should not be having bearing problems unless your engine case oil 
passages are partly or completely blocked.  Did you clean them out and make 
sure that oil passed through all of them easily?   Eric&amp;Barb
