I worked at a bike shop in Rochester MI right next to Auburn Hills home of
VWoA and DCX,had the pleasure of meeting a lot of people in the biz.One of
my customers worked in the communications dept of VWoA and told me that they
wanted to get all the vintage info(production info,parts catalogs...) online
for aircooled crowd.I was able to get this person a certain bike made by a
company sponsored by VW which was not in production yet,I was rewarded with
a shiny new micro-fiche for my efforts.They have the ability to do this but
need the blessings of the higher ups to get it done.I have also done product
demo days for TREK Bicycle with employees of VWoA and when I show up with
the Singlecab full of bicycles I have been pleasantly surprised with the
reaction of the employees to my truck,I let them drive it and they let me
drive some of their cars,some that are VERY tweaked.Like I said the
enthusiasm and the info is there it just needs approval.The employees of
VWoA are a different breed of people compared to the employees of other
large auto companies,more like a family than anything else.We can only ask
nicely and wait.

Actually I recently had mail from somebody with Arnold Communications,
which is the agency that handles both the advertising for Volkswagen of
America, and the web domain vw_dot_com. Apparently there is a push to &quot;put more
stuff on vw_dot_com that is of interest to all in the VW community&quot;, meaning
people who own vintage VWs. I hope they really do it.

Of course this is the Marketing Arm, which has nothing whatsoever to do
with the Technical Arm, which is where parts (and real consideration that
means something) come from. But still, a gesture is a gesture and it's nice
as far as it goes. Maybe if there were a LOT of interest and I were
informed about it OFF THE LIST, I could forward it to Arnold Communications
and say, &quot;look, we'd really, really like to have the microfiche on-line.
How about it?&quot;
