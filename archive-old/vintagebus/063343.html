Subject: [friday] 1 August

All,

Yesterday was 1 August 2002.  Here's some interesting things that
happened on that date:

1950: Approximately 1,700 Buses have been built since production
      began in March.

1951: The side air vents on panels get longer.  Total production to
      date 15,400.

1952: Gas filler neck gets smaller.  Total production to date 30,900.

1956: Rear shock absorbers changed.  Chassis ground strap added.  
      Total production to date 192,000. 

1958: Upholstered sun visors.  Total production to date 375,000.

1961: Fuel gauge standard; reserve switch goes away (too bad).
      Total production to date 803,000.

1962: 200 mm clutch.  1/3-2/3 front seat.  Wheel arches lose their
      lips.  Total production to date 971,000.
      
1963: &quot;1500&quot; front axle for everybody.  The &quot;VW&quot; on the hubcaps isn't
      painted black anymore.  Bigger rear window and flap.  Total
      production to date 1,144,000.

1964: Rev limiter standard.  Flap-type cooling air regulation instead
      of throttle ring.  Windshield washer standard.  Total production
      to date 1,329,000.

1965: 30-PICT-1.  Bigger generator.  2-speed wiper motor.  Rubber 
      switch knobs.  Total production to date 1,506,000.

1966: &quot;One key system.&quot;  Four-sided key goes away.  12 volt love for
      all.  Total production to date 1,682,000.

1967: After 1,853,000 splitties, the first bay-window Bus rolls off the
      line.  This also means that nearly * every splitty is at least 35
      years old now.  So check your fuel lines and make sure the cotter
      pins in the rear axle nuts are still there...

1968: Muir's Bus breaks down, leading him to buy a used '63 for $675
      in Albuquerque.  (About $3500 in 2002 dollars.)  If he had just
      bought that '64 at the VW dealer, the Idiot manual would have
      better info on the later-model splitties.  :)
