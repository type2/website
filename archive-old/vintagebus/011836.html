&gt; make sure your tow vehicle is heavier than 2,000lbs., to keep the
bus from

Better to keep it over 4000 pounds.  About the only vehicle that the
2000 pound limit would exclude is a bug! :)

This is a serious issue, as you will be towing 2500-3000 pounds of
unbraked mass.  If you tow with a vehicle of equal mass, then all of
your braking distances will double, assuming that you can keep the
whole works going in the same direction.
