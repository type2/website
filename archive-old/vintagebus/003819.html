  STOP!  No more ads for VWs that we might want to buy!  STOP!  No more photos
of our/your bus's progress!  STOP!  No more posting of a better supplier of repo
parts!  STOP!  No more listing of dates of coming events!  STOP!  No more stories/photos of 
events that you went to!  STOP!  No more questions about VBs and OH, please don't let 
me forget, the EGOS of some people who happen to know how to FIX VWS!!!!!!!
     &quot;RIDICULOUS.............&quot;
  Imagine a VB list page with no postings..........BLANK!!!!!!!
