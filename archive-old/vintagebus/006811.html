Being that out of all of my sets of 15 inch rims, all dated 61 and earlier I
have only 1 crows foot, I would be more then happy to trade 4 non crows for
4 crows for my side loader, even though it is a 61.

Hi Kyle,
Yes, but what happens when you install the wrong bumper?  Does the bus/truck

fall off of tall cliffs?  Since rims are alot more important to keeping the 
VW on the road and not suddenly off of it the parts book would have shown it

if there was a problem of this magnitude.  Thusly if the crow foot rims was 
to be a significant reinforcement for trucks and panels only....  Plus so
far 
we only have been able to find one non-crow foot rim dated before 1960.
This 
would mean that we only can find truck or panel rims?  When more kombis, 
westies, deluxes were imported to the USA?  Eric&amp;Barb
