B.T.W. if anyone has any used seals form 55-71 I'm interested in purchasing 
them.
They don't have to be all that nice.
Thanks-
Gregory

&lt;&lt;List:

&gt;&gt;Year of bus: early 1959

&gt;&gt;My recollection of original engine compartment seals is that the corners 
are mitred &gt;&gt;and glued/welded together.  Yet, the new aftermarket seals not 
only come in 4 pieces, &gt;&gt;but also seem to have a different profile.

Yes, they are angled at the endges and glued together.
Yep, the repop seals suck ass. Someone needs to remake them correctly.

&gt;&gt;Question 1: Was there a year change on the profile and installation of 
engine &gt;&gt;compartment seals, just as the front door seals changed around 
'63ish?

I think all years originally were the same. The new gaskets available from VW 
in the 80ies were slightly different than the originals. Still waaaaay better 
than repop.

&gt;&gt;Question 2: Were the early ('59) engine compartment seals mitred at the 
corners?  &gt;&gt;And if so, would it make sense to try and mitred the new 
aftermarket seals, or just &gt;&gt;install in four separate pieces?

Id do it in one piece. Remember the split is at the center of the rear 
valence.

&gt;&gt;Question 3: Are they installed with adhesive, or just held in place by the 
edge lip?

I believe held in place.....I could be wrong....my busses are so wasted I'm 
surprised if any rubber is left.

&gt;&gt;TIA.
