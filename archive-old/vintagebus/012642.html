More problems with Carter's transaxles:

Mine, installed in January with ~1000 miles now, if that, makes a funky
noise until you put the clutch in.  The shifting has been
really balky as well, from day one, and it pops out of reverse
occasionally. Already.  And yes, I replaced all the mounts and couplers
when I installed it.

A friend of mine put one in his '66 bug, and the rear input seal
blew up somewhere along the way, causing a big, nasty leak.  His has been
in for something like a week.

I remember some other beefs about these trannies, but discounted them
because I have another one that's been doing swell for several
thousand miles.  Maybe it's a recent QC problem.

Now I (and he) get to see what the so-called &quot;warranty&quot; looks like...

It's a lot of work to install a bus transaxle; not something I want to
do over and over again until they get one right.
