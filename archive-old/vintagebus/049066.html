Congratulations to  Ronnie on the widow's peak bus salvage (an entry in the &quot;barndoor&quot; replacement contest). I've got a vintage looking vise-grip I'll donate until you can find a real wheel. Hmmm, weld a 1&quot; dia. pipe to the tops of 3 vise-grips. One or two oughta grip the column and the other would be an adjustable cigar holder, whaddya say?

Reminder to all, Madera Spring Fling VW show on the grass and under the trees, Sunday, Sunday, SUNDAY. (30th) ONLY $5 to drive in, can of food to walk in.  The $15 I mentioned earlier is for commercial vendors, not swappers. I'll bring my Internet Hot Wheels bus toy and abuse it in the races until it's worth nothing on E-Bay. (Wait,... a trophy winning, race-proven Internet HW bus! Worth $500+!)

 We get a lot of Bay area people. Rex and Gabe will be there, right? Saw a 25hp early bug last year, driven from Lompoc. C'mon down, over, across, or through. Had a bunch of famers stop by my double cab 2 years ago with tales of single cabs and tilts out on the farms. No paydirt yet, but we're sniffing out a '61 single and a mid '60's double cab.
