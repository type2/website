 The new lettering and graphics for &quot; Howard Farms &quot; &quot; we grow buses &quot; &quot;Lake
Havasu City, Az &quot; and more will be on the panel for the Classic. Will debut
at the pre classic christmas tree farm campout at Rich's on Friday. Been in
the works for about 6 weeks and doing final crap with the lettering/painting
guy in town. Big difference between the 2 of us on what goes where. Rich,
the dech lid is with Ronnie on the way to Pomona.
