 Missed Friday but still should be good. Refer to July 2000 VW Trends, page
72, picture of Bob Hole in middle right. I know what he does in his spare
time. LAUGHS ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK!!!! with all our  $$$$$. Do any of you
know what it will cost you to get into the VW Classic this year??? How about
$15.00 per person, not $15 per bus or bug like R.K. used to charge. For
those of you swapping how much do you have to sell to get back your $65.00
swap fee???? And that is for used parts only,not NEW parts to be sold in
used swap spots. That should leave out a bunch of venders who sell used and
NEW parts in the cheap spots, will the BH cops be out in force??. But it is
only $55.00 if you pre pay, still at lot to make up. How much is the cost
for new parts vendors?? No wonder prices are going up. The cost increase is
blamed on the city for charging a $10.00 vendor tax fee  for used parts that
have already been charged a tax when parts were bought new in the 1st place,
plus they have your SS# and tax # . Anyway it looks like the cool swap place
will be the OCTO show with their $10.00 fee for everything. Get to OCTO
early as I'm sure most of the selling will be there!! I'm off the band wagon
now. The list has been to quiet. Can you tell I agree with Thom. Hope to see
most of you at christmas tree island friday before OCTO for tacos and
dinner.
