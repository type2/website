I just cleaned my shower doors that had years of mineral deposits on it.
Went to a glass &amp; paint shop and on the counter was a product called
Nothin's Better.  This stuff works great.  I also got a small scrub
brush that was made for use on scratchable materials.  It is a micro
abrasive and really took the coating off.  I also used it on the aluminum
frame and it cleaned and polished that really well.

I had previously tried everything available in the supermarket/drug store
and nothing even touched it, until this product.  I even got a free
sample sized container, and it was enough to do the entire shower, so
even that size would do a whole bus.

Greetings, All...
    I am seeking advise about how to clean the glass in the 65 that I am
working on. The bus was pulled from a field here in Oklahoma after
sitting 28 years and the glass has a crusty coating on it. The coating
is a slight whitish hazing that resembles lime deposit in a shower.
I tried using some household cleaners with minimal success.
