Subject: Ignition Switch/Headlight Problem

Hello List,

I have a problem concerning my headlights and ignition. For sometime I have
had the occasional &quot;hot starter&quot; symptoms which sounds like a dead battery,
but eventually turns over fine.  To correct this I installed a Bosch HSR
from WW, which appears to give a bit more juice to the starter (6 volt
system), although I'm still experiencing the slow starts after running for
10+ minutes and stopping off somewhere.
Two nights ago I got in the truck and began by warming up the engine as it
was extremely cold
(50 degrees...hey I live in FL) After the warm-up I pulled the light switch
and the lights came on as normal then died all of a sudden along with the
engine. When trying to restart I get nothing, no dash lights, clicks or
anything.
Today I had a few minutes to run some tests. Test light indicates power to
lighting switch and ignition. Turning the ignition switch doesn't send power
over to the starter or coil, but instead makes the power at terminal 30
become non-existent.  Same with the lighting switch, pulling the switch
kills the power to the main lead instead of distributing power to lights.
Do these symptoms seem to be related to a grounding problem up front or in
the rear with the new HSR?
Thanks so much,

-Tom
