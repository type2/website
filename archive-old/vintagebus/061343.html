Hi all,

 I just finished removing the engine from my ' 63 Westy for a rebuild.  It is the first time I've had the engine out.  The trans seemed to shift well, but I haven't driven the bus too much.  When I pulled the engine out, the input shaft for the trans came out with it...There is a snap ring on the trans side of the shaft that was partially off,  and that's it.  What should be in the trans to hold the shaft in?  Will I have to rebuild the trans too ?

Any ideas/ information is appreciated

Thanks,

Matt
