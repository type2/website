Grommet looks like the one that goes into the sheet metal in the engine
compartment and a &quot;leg&quot; of the air filter fits into it.

&gt; So I was working on my 60 in the backyard the other day and I also had my
78
&gt; there giving it a wash and wax.  The next day I found this kinda wire
thing -
&gt; I don't recognise it as being from my bus .... but I have no explanation
as to
&gt; why it would be in my back yard.  Does anyone recognize this wire thing.
&gt;
&gt; I also found this grommet in my 78 when I got it - anyone recognize it?
Part
&gt; Number 211 129 690
&gt;
&gt; TIA
&gt; jdd 60 std, 78 westy
