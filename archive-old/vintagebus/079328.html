Subject: more 6V conversion.._dot_using used motor

so i bought this motor at a reasonable price as a good used motor.  did the 
ground start thing when I went to look at it... the guy was hotrodding his bus 
and didn't want a 1600.  

SO yesterday all the 6V stuff is swapped over, the ground start is set up.. 
I'll start it up again.  hm.  click click.   remove bell housing test starter.  
click click.  find other 6V starter, install in bell housing, test... click 
whirr! click whirrrr!!!   cool.  hook up to engine again.  click vuh - room vuh 
- room.   barely turns over.  the old 6V battery is low..  try a 12V for 
turning...  nada nothing zero.   has 8.8 V, should turn a 6V starter.  hm.  find a 
really crusty 12V battery in a corner... it has 12.8 V, and turns the engine 
aroudn REALLY fast.
okay, that's hooked up fro the starter... hook the 6V battery up for the 
coil, gas in can to fuel pump.   touch wire to starter... whiirrr vroomm... 
starts.  makes noises.  gas drips out by filter... pull wire off... engine stops.. 
fix fuel leak, start engine.  vroom... sounds like a motor.  No horrible 
knocking or thumping noises.

blows smoke?  :(  sounds like a rubbing fan :(.  oh, bother.   after a few 
minutes blows less smoke.  turn engine off, re shim generator so fan doesn't rub 
 (funny thing is with fan belt off it didn't rub, but with belt on it did ... 
go figure)  swap air jet from 130 to 145y (didn't find a 155y)  Start it up 
again... sounds better (no rub) but still some smoke.  white smoke.  let it run 
about 20 mins at 2K rpms.  sounds a bit futty though, now and then... maybe a 
little backfiey thinking of mini burplets.  maybe I should use a dif carb.

****why would an engine smoke when last time it didn't.****
  It had been sitting inside for about a year since I got it, and the test 
run didn't smoke.    weak coil?  rings need to reseat?

oil leaks from under FW.  I was afraid of this... the FW I used had being 
sitting a while and had rust where the seal rides... I sanded it smooth... but 
that didn't make it perfect.   It was a stepped crank FW on a later crank... but 
that works, eh?   I could see the extra oil spit out when I gave the engine 
gas.  put kitty litter down to soak up the drips.

then I drained the oil... it has a 1 1/2 qt sump thing on the bottom...   oil 
was dirty.  and it seemed a 1/2 qt high, but didn't smell like gas.    plate 
was full of sludge.  plate was held on by bolts.   I don't think the plate had 
been cleaned in a LONG time, but the oil didn't seem to have extra particles 
in it (I always use a clean pan, and the tea leaf reading seemed okay)    
filled it up with 4 1/2 qts fresh clean oil.
