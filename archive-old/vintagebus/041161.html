If you have the right seals, they should be a press fit into the drum.  You
should have to press them, or tap them with a block of wood and a hammer, to
get them into the drum.  Then they shouldn't go anywhere.  You might have
the wrong seals.

I'd throw away the greasy shoes.  They don't cost that much, and greasy
shoes can grab something terrible, leading to bus-ballet (pirroettes and
all).

&gt; So I can see now why my brakes seemed odd.  The seals didn't seal!  Should
&gt; there be something that prevents the seals from going all the way to the
&gt; backing plates?  From the plate there is a spacer, the seal rides right on
&gt; top of that, then there is a bearing then the wheel.  Should there be
&gt; something between the spacer and the bearing that prevents the seal from
&gt; going all the way to the backing plate.  This is surely wrong.  Both of my
&gt; front drums have tons of grease in them.
