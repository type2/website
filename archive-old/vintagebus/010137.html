After about half a year(!) I've got my Kombi back.  It was supposed to take
a coupla weeks, but the dude is pretty slow.  I recognized a lot of other
cars when I picked it up that had been there *before* mine, so I guess he
just takes his time!  I just drove it several hundred miles back home and
had a blast.  Figured out that 67mph on the speedo is actually 60mph, no
wonder everybody was tailgating me when I thought I was going 55...

The front end was rebuilt as part of the deal.  It was discovered that the
beam was bent from a previous accident (as was the passenger side in general
;-)).  In order to allow for free movement on that side of the link pins,
the wheel has about 3 degrees of positive camber.  The DPO (not the one I
bought it from though) simply hammered the pins before, which got the right
camber but thrashed the pins and needle bearings.

So the question is, how often should I swap the front tires to compensate
for uneven wear?  Every oil change?  Have to raise the front for greasing
anyway.  I'd love to try and *fix* it, but the Bentley helpfully states
&quot;Camber is not adjustable.&quot;  I can't really replace the front beam, as it's
custom fit to the bent frame :-)  I do have a spare beam though that I could
pirate for parts if need be.  Any suggestions, or do I stick with rotating
the tires?  The camber on the driver's side is within spec, which also makes
me wonder...the Bentley says the camber between the two shouldn't vary by
more than 30', and my variance is around 2.5 degrees ^_^  It does not like
crosswinds one bit.

Thanks for any help keeping the &quot;cursed bus&quot; on the road!
