3 M makes a product just for these areas in an arosol can, it's called Rust
Fighter and their number is 8892. This is a excellent product for the rocker
and dogleg areas in a bus, also any area where you can't see. I use it in
the base of the cargo doors and all the seamed areas where rust seems to
begin. It has a tube on it like brake cleaner so it can reach in the hidden
areas. I don't believe roofing tar would be a very good product to use in
these areas as it would just seal in any RUST that has already started. The
3M product inhibits rust as well as sealing against it. Leave it to 3M to
come up with this awesome product. COST retail 15.17 a can and 1 can will do
both doglegs and a few door bottoms.

 &lt;&lt;What about cargo doors, rear hatch, front doors, engine compartment, 
ect.?&gt;&gt;
 Again the main nasty rusty areas seem to occur on the lower sides and 
bottoms of these seals.  So we have been thinking about treating only these 
lower areas to prevent problems.
