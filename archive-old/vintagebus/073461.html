Subject: Re: [VB] How Much Paint?

You ask how much paint--
It all depends on what your choice of materials is--and what your going
over-

Lacquer for the clear coat is a material of the stone age-and will not
withstand the elements well--it will shrink and crack from the sun
alone--if it is exposed to any cold it'll get crows feet-- 

Think clear urethane--bullet proof--and with the right amount of
massaging will appear as good and smooth as lacquer--


Later,
Terry

How Much Paint? 
For you folks who have painted there Bus recently; How much paint did it
take. I thinking 2 qts of White (above the beltline) and 2 qts of Blue
(below the beltline). Then 1 gallon of clear, may be using House of
Kolors lacquer based clear so I can paint it in my garage.
