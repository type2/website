KEvin,

from my memories of having done this, are you referring to the
smaller upper outer bearing? If so, that's on the main axle, not the stub,
which is below. I don't recall any tendency for movement when trying to
tap on that bearing. Are you sure you have all your circlips, retainers,
etc installed?
