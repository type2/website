And I found out the hard way that why won't fit if you have a deep sump on your motor.

Anyone have an &quot;round-tube&quot; version they wish to clean out of the old attic?

&gt; I've yet to pull anything with it.   The biggest drawback is that you must
&gt; completely remove it to get the motor out.  I had to make up u-bolts that
&gt; were long enough too.  The ball size is metric and they are a bitch to find
&gt; over here but other than that they are great ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Basically a useless accessory....cool though.
