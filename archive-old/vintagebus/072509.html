Subject: Re: [VB] How do you convert a 65' from 6volt to 12 volt ?

i agree with clara, 6 volts works fine.  i've got three running vws, all originally 6 volt with one converted to 12.  one of these days i'm gonna convert it back to 6 because i've found it's a pain the butt.  my two other 6 volters function well, start nice and have bright lights.  the problem i have with the 12 volt conversion is that not everything functions.  it's irritating looking for those one-year and conversion parts for an already expensive model/year... (stupid beetles).  my single cab and ghia start right up and their lights are as bright as any 12 volt.

cheers,
