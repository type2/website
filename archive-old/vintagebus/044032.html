Rebellion?  Possibly.  Rebelling agianst the throw away easily disposable
society we have become???  Sure, and why not.
Sure, I'll buy a set of side molding rather than try to repair a nasty
original one, and so on.  But then there are other things..starter motors
for example, that I would rather try and repair -vs- swap a non working
one for a rebuilt one.  Obviously someone else is rebuilding it and making
money doing it.  Why not me?
I don't think I'll ever go as far as rebuilding my burned out turn signal
bulbs tho!
