&gt;Hi Paul,
&gt;How big of diameter are these tires measured on the outside?  What you have
&gt;quoted sound a little small.  The stock JAN 1964-on buses used a 25-25.5&quot;
&gt;diameter and the 1955-early 64 used about 26-27&quot; diameter.  The smaller the
&gt;diameter the higher you will have to RPM the engine.  The bigger the
diameter
&gt;the lower the RPMs.  Of course with the bigger tires you will have a little
&gt;lower speed climbing hills, but unless you live in Colorado State or in the
&gt;Alps you will need more speed on the flats.     Eric&amp;Barb

hi folks
i may well be wrong but isn't the 80 series (ratio) ((whatever)) the
standard.

ie mostly not quoted... (85 14  = 185 80 14?).

if 80 is not - what is?
