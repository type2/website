Subject: RMMW's replacements Noses??
Date: Sat, 2 Jun 2001 23:43:01 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Anyone ever used one of the replacement Nose Skins from Rocky Mountain Motor
Works?  I have the Da***** luck.  Scrapped the 67 project because all the
metal behind the Nose Skin needed replacing.  Bought a 66 that needed both
Rockers, one Jackpoint and Outrigger and thought the nose just had some
minor Body work done to it.  I started grind the filler out and about 3
inched up from the bottom the thing has about 3/4 inch of filler.  It has
about 1/2 inch under the right headlight.  I was going to cut the lower &quot;V&quot;
out of the 67 Panel and use it.  But I notice that RMMW's has a replacement
Nose on sale, without Window channels, for $139.  If the freight doesn't eat
me up that sounds pretty good.
