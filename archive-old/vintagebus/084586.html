What  kind of grease are you guys using? Speed seems ok, I did notice a pick 
up in  speed but it doesn't seem to run fast to me.



Hi Seth,
We use lithium grease.  Tried a heavier wheel grease once and  regretted it 
right away.  Have been wondering if white lithium grease  being thinner would 
work better in cold conditions, or would it leak  out.  MAKE SURE not to use 
too much grease in there.  You only want to  fill the gear box about 1/4 to 1/3 
full.
  Good to take apart the wiper shaft pivots and grease them up.
