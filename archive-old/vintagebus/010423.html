&gt;while I am changing lanes from left to right I always put the signal on and
&gt;ease her over gradually , incase any one is there we might only tap them as
&gt;opposed to causeing a total collision  . IS THIS THE BRAILLE METHOD ???
&gt;does any one else have this problem?
&gt;
Yes, I use the same method when changing lanes in my panel. I use the added
refinement of keeping a near-constant look in my passenger side mirror (van
is RHD) to see when people are driving into my blind spot.

I have also considered painting a large sign on the blind side, saying
&quot;Warning!! Blind Side!&quot;. I dunno if it would be any use though.
