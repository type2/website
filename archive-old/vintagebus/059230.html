&gt;I have an airspeed indicator in my bus. that way i can get my true
&gt;airspeed through the air, compare it to groundspeed off of the speedo,
&gt;pull out my E6B flight computer, find out how much wind correction
&gt;angle i need to put in to stay on course.

I was going to put a full Collins stack in my Bus, flight computer,
glass cockpit, dual ARINC-429 buses, the works.  Then I found out
I'd have to upgrade the Bus to 28 volt.  If the wind gets real bad,
an HSI might help.  But the thing I reallly want is TCAS with
moron prox (kinda like ground prox, but different -- helps avoid
those ugly CFISUV incidents).

There is a Bus in a junkyard near Tulsa that was apparently owned
by a pilot or aircraft mechanic; it has all kinds of placards that
belong in an aircraft stuck on the dash, air vent, etc.
