Hello Friendly Bus People,

Today at work, things were a little slow, and I've been putting in too
much overtime, so I finally decided to do something about the front end
alignment problem that's been eating my tires...

I have the good fortune of working at a large vintage VW shop, BTW
(yeah, ok, I'm bragging a little. I just got this job a couple months
ago, and I'm still excited about it!). At any rate, I took a long lunch
and attacked my kingpin problem in the bay I normally work out of.

The problem seemed to be that I was missing some shims, or that the
shims were placed incorrectly by the PO. I didn't think the pins were
bad, because I didn't have excessive play. I had called Bus Boys in CA a
few weeks ago and the nice man on the phone sent me a pack of shims, no
charge (said he had jillions of them, all over the place), and a nice
sticker to put on my back window.

I started on the left side. Had to scrape a bunch of crud off of the
whole thing so I could see what I was working on. I hoped that I could
leave the brake hose attached, so I wouldn't have to bleed the brakes,
but wound up taking it loose from the brake line.

The lower pin looked fine, and was packed in grease like it's supposed
to be. The top pin, however, was dry as a bone, and when I pulled the
pin out, a lot of rusty needle bearings (hey, I didn't know those were
in there!) fell out, all over the floor. Also, the upper pin had a lot
of worn grooves from those rusty bearings. Shims had disentegrated from
the friction and heat, I guess.

I hadn't ordered pins. I guess I'll get them, as soon as funds allow
($79.95 each from RMW, less possible employee discount!) I reassembled
the bearing the best I could, packed it with grease, and put in new
shims according to the instructions that the nice man at Bus Boys sent
me with the shims. Took me about an hour for the left side. Right side
took considerably less time, but it had the same problems. Put it back
together, with the proper number of shims and greased all the fittings.
Dropped the bus back onto the ground and took her for a drive...

She handles a lot better now, and the wheels are sitting upright like
they are supposed to, instead of leaning in. The bus seems to steer much
easier, and I think in addition to saving my next set of front tires,
I'll probably save some gas money, too...

Tackling an unfamiliar problem with my bus, figuring it out and
understanding it, and fixing or improving it gives me a great boost in
my self confidence. I give to her, and she gives back. This alone is
reason enough for me to own and drive (daily) an old bus!
