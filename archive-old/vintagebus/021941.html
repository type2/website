&lt;&lt; Looks like I'm organizing the Caravan North
  We will be departing from Albany Oregon around 10:00am on Saturday April the
 29th in route to Puyallup at splitty speeds. I know that we'll have at least 
two busses on maiden voyages so we won't be pushing it hard. We will be 
stopping for lunch along the way. Last year we drove up the back roads and 
stopped at a wrecking yard but this year we plan on sticking to I-5. 
Depending on the time we may stop in at Averre's in Longview, but if I 
remember he's pretty far off the freeway? And I don't know for sure if he's 
even open on Saturdays. It's a little over 200 miles from Albany and about a 
5 hour trip couting lunch. Put us there around 3:00. At least two of us are 
swapping and will take advantage of the early setup in the evening.
 
 Logistics are
  Meet Time: 10:00 am
 Date:      4/29/2000
 Place:     Albany Oregon Kmart Parking Lot, 3100 Pacific Blvd SE
 
 So far: Chris T, Jack M, Darren W, and Myself, (anyone counting? that's 4 
split
 window campers) anyone else?  if you want to join us along the way or if your
 coming from farther south than Chris and want to join, let us know where 
you'll
 be waiting. 
 
 I'm are planning a &quot;dust of your bus day&quot; on the 22nd at Darren's house if 
you
 want to stop by and have someone take a look at something before we leave.
