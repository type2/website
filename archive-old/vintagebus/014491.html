Does anyone know where I can get hinges for my pop-out windows?
 1962 15 window.

 Better buses came with only the 2 pop outs.
    I have been know to remove the extra pop outs

I was just going to use piano hinge to put in the extra 4 pop outs in my
bus.  Now that I got the extra 2 with my parts bus I just need 2 more.
Clara, If you have troubles with leaks check out some fresh WCM rubbers.
If we didn't live so far apart, I would gladly unburden you of those
spare window frames you must have kicking around.

Hi Daniel,

now think about it.  the window frames are rusty.  if you want some rusty
window frames, we can make a deal.    6 pop outs seems excessive,   useful
largely if you dont want to bother to open a back one.   and 1 seal costs
less than 3, plus less work with frames etc.    This climate only dries out a
small part of the year.     Before you scream bus mangler, do realise the
buses this was done to were destined for the crusher if I hadn't helped them,
 and were to be daily drivers, far from restored shiny and beautiful.

Clara
