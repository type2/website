At the risk of doing something wrong, I am going to jump right in with a
question.  

I am new to the bus list and have done some research on some of the terms
used.  I am a ghia owner so excuse me if I use the wrong terms. 

I have been interested in buying an early split window bus and I have come
across a 63' double door.  ( I think that is what you call them.  Cargo doors
on both driver and passenger side)   I am intrigued over the extra set of
doors on the drivers side.  Can someone tell me how rare this is?  I am also
interested in the value of a bus like this.  Let me describe.  I believe the
bus was a cargo van with no windows down the sides, but someone has put 3
camper ( jealousy window style) on each side.  the panel behind the drivers
seat has been cut out and the front seats look like they are out of a late
ghia.  the interior is basically home style wood paneling screwed to the
walls.  On the up side the bus is mostly rust free.  undercarraige is clean
and the &quot;fender areas&quot; look clean too.  One hole in the floor about 3 inches
in diameter.  Any help on Value, rarity, history, and availability of parts
for restoration on this specific bus would be greatly appreciated.  

PS- The bus is in Michagan, if that makes a difference.

Thanks,
Steve
