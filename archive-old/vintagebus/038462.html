BBB#3 Lake Havasu-Jan 22-23-24--BIG BUS SWAP MEET-BUS SHOW

Southwest Airlines is running a special if you purchase tickets before
Midnight PST Christmas Eve...

Anyway, here are the rates of relevance:
  Las Vegas:
     $98 each way to/from Jacksonville
     $63 each way to/from Kansas City
     $98 each way to/from Orlando
     $31 each way to/from Phoenix
     $35 each way to/from San Diego
     $39 each way to/from San Jose
     $56 each way to/from Seattle
(travel can be anytime between Jan 12 and June 3)

Anyway -- I'm trying to see if my girlfriend and I can work out a weekend
campout at the event... we could bring a tent and camp gear.

Is there anyone willing to pick us up at Las Vegas airport and also bum a
return ride?  Most likey will come in Friday morning and return Sunday
night...

Thanks.
