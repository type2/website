Pulled out of Lenoir a little early, had plans to meet some folks before I 
got to Snoopy's.  The Express was grumbling along making all the right 
noises as we ran the usual route down I77 between Charlotte &amp; Columbus.  All 
of a sudden she started missing and backfiring, losing power, then quit 
completely.  The oil pressure was up as long as she was turning over so I 
didn't think we'd suffered internal engine damage.  Rolled to the side of 
the road, broke out the barely adequate tool kit and VOM to see what the 
problem might be.

Oil level was fine, and I couldn't help but notice the absence of a large 
gaping hole in the engine case.  There was fuel in the filter, a squirt 
could be heard going into the carbs when I tickled the throttle.  Hmmm.  
Just for fun, tried her again and she started right up.  No sense sitting 
along the side of the road with the rigs and a$$*)!_at_s er SUV drivers blowing 
by at 80+.  She was still backfiring and making almost no power but we 
managed the 1/4 mile to the nearest exit.  Power to the coil, the signal 
from the Pertronix didn't follow the pattern points usually show.  Must be 
the igniter went bad.  No problem, put in the extra dizzy with the points.  
Always carry stuff like that.  Open the spare bus locker and find the extra 
dizzy.  No points!  &lt;insert unkind word here&gt;  That's right, helped someone 
else out, gave them the spares, never replaced them. &lt;another unkind word&gt;  
There's nothing at this exit but litter.  The whole time I was there, nobody 
took it from either direction.  Probably 1 of those great ideas some 
politician had - growth opportunity for Bubbaville.

Fortunately, I had John's phone #.  Just looked, he's not on the AIRS list, 
but I am so this IS an AIRS story.  Called John, he was more than willing to 
help.  He left his house drove almost 40 miles with 2 kids that weren't his 
(they had company), and brought me a set of points.  While I was waiting, 
pulled the dizzy, then sat and played my guitar for a while.  John showed 
up, in no time dizzy was back in and timed.  the BIG MOMENT was here!  Turn 
the key, she starts right up idles just fine.  Big grin and thumbs up ease 
her into gear and KABLAM BOOMITY POP POP she's backfiring again.  &lt;yet 
another unkind word&gt;.  Doublecheck gap and timing, both are spot on.  Hmmm.  
Random firing, if not timing, must be the coil.   But coils &gt;never&lt; go bad.  
But wait, I had one go bad after High Country Bus fest a couple years ago.  
Pull the coil, put the meter across it, infinite resistance across the 
primary side.  &lt;even more unkind words&gt;

John smiled, said get in lets go get a coil.  We drove a long time before we 
saw any civilization.  The parts store in town was closed.  No problem sez 
he, we'll get the coil off my bus.  So we went chez John and Anna, get to 
see the imaginary bus - yes, the Terrapin Flier is real!  John pulls the 
coil, back in the car, and off we go back to the Express.  Install coil, she 
fires right up, running great.  John follows me to his exit and off he goes. 
  Didn't tell me my taillights were out but the really nice South Carolina 
State Trooper did.  So did the not so nice one later on.  But that's a 
different tale.
