Suggestion to the person looking to make the repros. Perhaps you should
consider making the little white plastic bezel nut that holds the switch
to the lense.

Another plastic piece that would be handy is the clear plastic shaft seal for
later safari windows. Unfortunately, I no longer have NOS extra from which to
pattern. Are these readily available? Being somewhat out of the mix for a few
years, I have had no occasion to check.
I think it's great that more and more items are (finally) becoming available!
Thanks to those who take the time/effort/dinero required.
