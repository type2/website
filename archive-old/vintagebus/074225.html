Subject: RE: [VB] Porsche dizzy? (was rebuilt distributors)

This is the accumulated info I have on distributors:



Retard of 3.5 degrees on cylinder #3 to prevent overheating.

Year		Dist #	Start	Full in	Degree	#3 Ret

1959-60	.010		imed	1700rpm	18-22		yes
up to 1959	.019		imed	3500rpm	28-32		yes
		.031		1200	2800rpm	28-32		yes
		.009		imed	2400rpm	24-30		yes
		.050		imed	3100rpm	20-26		no
Mallory			imed	3000rpm	18-24		no

111 905 205M   '65 Beetle, '64-'65 Bus
113 905 205M   '68 Beetle MT, Bus
025 905 205M   '86-'90 Vanagon

113 905 205M  17-19deg _at_ 1.3 In. Hg, 32-35deg _at_ 3.2 In. Hg
111 905 205M   5-11deg _at_ 1.3 In. Hg, 23-28deg _at_ 3.5 In. Hg

On a '68 Bus, the 113 905 205M would have been on a 1600 sp with 30 PICT 2.
On a '64-'65 Bus, the 111 905 205M would have been on a 1500 with 28 PICT 1.
Either will probably work, but the '68 Bus application is closer to what
you have.  According to http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm , the
advance on the 113 905 205M comes in sooner:

Maybe there's a more specific meaning for &quot;205&quot; that I'm not aware of, but
every single VW part number for a distributor found on
http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ovhignbo.htm is a &quot;205&quot;.  The letters after the
205 are important too.

I believe a 019 is from an early Bus. They were also sold with a bosch blue,
both were painted metallic blue and were a &quot;screamer kit&quot;.
I ran mine for a while but then I went back to my 010. I did like it though.

BTW, the caps/points are getting a little pricey for them.
