&gt; Oh-Tay Volks.....With all this about fuel purchases it seams that Volks tend
&gt; to spend their money on &quot;Regular&quot;.  Have I missed so much on Octain Opinions
&gt; that I've missed the relevance on 93 vs 87 octane levels.  My Fuel door
&gt; still says &quot;Oktan Min. 91 ROZ/RON&quot;

91 RON is THE SAME as the 87 that you buy at U.S. pumps. That IS regular gas. Do
not buy premium because you think 91 RON is premium!

From my 77 type2 owners manual page 26:

''Regular fuels have an octane rating ranging from 91 to 95 RON [Research Octane
Number] or 87 to 91 CLC [Cost of Living Council Octane rating].
The 91 RON octane rating which you will find on the fill door is based on the
research method. The CLC octane rating usually displayed on U.S. gasoline pumps
is calculated as follows: research octane number plus motor octane number,
divided by 2.

That is      RON + MON
                --------------------
                          2

The CLC is usually 4 points less than the RON rating:
91 RON equals 87 CLC
95 RON equals 91 CLC''
