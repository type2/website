&lt;&lt; Better to keep it over 4000 pounds.  About the only vehicle that the
 2000 pound limit would exclude is a bug! :)
 
 This is a serious issue, as you will be towing 2500-3000 pounds of
 unbraked mass.  If you tow with a vehicle of equal mass, then all of
 your braking distances will double, assuming that you can keep the
 whole works going in the same direction.

Hi George,
The pre-1968 bug wieghs about 1200 lbs. and the pre-1968 bus wieghs about 1600
lbs..  We have towed bugs and ghias (Ghias wiegh about 1400lbs.) with our 1960
panel camper and the only problem with this set up is one tended to forget
that they were towing.  Encountering any sharp turns and/or stops was a real
wake up call due to the VW being towed pushing the rear of the tow VW around.
So one has to consistantly say over and over to themself that they are towing
and get rid of any distractions onboard.  On the other hand we have towed
pre-1968 buses with pre-1968 buses and the effect is sicking.  You are
consistantly being pushed around even on the straight roads and have to make
steering corrections like a mad man, especially when going down the slightest
hill.  As to towing in this condition on unknown roads, this would be suicide.
So even though VW says that the pre-1968 bus can tow up to 2282 lbs. in
unladen wieght (&quot;Unladen&quot; meaning towed right?) with a pre-1968 bus we would
suggest keeping your tow vehicle to at least 2,000 lbs. and thusly that would
give it at least 400 lbs more over the pre-1968 bus .  Forgot to mention in
last email that if the bus you are going to tow has an engine.  Take it out
and put it aboard your tow vehicle.  This would make the pre-1968 bus 200 lbs.
lighter and you tow vehicle that much heavier.
Watch those turns and stops while towing,   Eric &amp; Barb
