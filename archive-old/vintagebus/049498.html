Subject: dizzy pics and questions

put up a crappy-lookin'  page with some photos of distributors I have lying
around... need help identifying some, their use, and opinions on whether or
not they would be fun to try in the bus (which currently has a 009 in its
1600 sp). Jim T's page helped with some, but not all of these ids, so extra
info would be appreciated.

btw, that T3 FI dizzy works great in a bus... this one sticks a little, so
I'm not using it until I clean it.

the &quot;271&quot; and &quot;VW&quot; dizzys look identical except for the cap/rotor, have NO
id #s on the body, small drain w/ screen under advance plate, BIG phenolic
rubbing blocks.
