Hello everyone,
Coming from the Oakland area I can tell you all that there is not a virtual 
plothera of early and rare VW's. I have seen pictures and heard of what's out 
there in Oakland, and from what I could see there was a split window bug, an 
early Porsche, and some other miscellaneous junk in the yard. Not much else 
going on over there. If someone else has anything different, like maybe a 
stash inside the warehouse or at his own house, please let me know and I can 
try to find out more. I have some cop friends who can find out the good stuff 
like that.
Hope everyone has a good weekend.
