 Any pointers in hacking up a bus for disposal are welcome at this point.
 Be gentle, it's my first time...
 
 In particular, I want to save the doglegs and walk-thru section, two goals
 which at first appear to be mutually exclusive...

buy one of those set of drill bits for drilling out spot welds.  They are 
really cool.   they cut a circle, so you drill around the spot weld and can 
pull the sections apart and use them separately.   

okay sometimes you can't get a drill in places, so use a chisel and the BFH, 
but the spot weld drill bit is really nifty, and quick.
