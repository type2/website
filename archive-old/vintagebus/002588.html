There is no need for the pain!  Go to an auto glass shop and get what they
call &quot;channel packing&quot;...it's cheap.
It fits.  It repels water.  It folds over the glass (when warm), if you cut
the corners slightltly to allow it to bend, and with a slight moistening of
mineral spirits, it slides into place with a long firm push with the wing in
the assembly, in the bus!  So far, mine hasn't leaked, (it's raining
now...we'll see!)

Here's the post I got this info from:

From Cecil Turner:

The best way I've found to seal the vent wings is to not use a rubber
seal at all.

I've had to replace about 4 of the vent wing handles in the last 6
months.

I found the best thing to use is a seal that the window guys use. Go by
the local autoglass
shop and tell the guy what you are doing.  He has this roll of seal just
for that kind of application.  It's like a tar paper but with a little
more moisture in it. My local guy gave
me about 6 feet of the stuff for free just to take a look at my bus.

By putting on a little kerosene or mineral spirits, the tars in the
paper become slippery, and
you can just ease the window in the frame.  Since it is petro based, it
can be a little messy,
but it does clean up quickly with a bug and tar remover.  I did mine by
hand, without a clamp
or without removing the window from the door.  Once it's in it doesn't
shrink, so it can be
trimmed immediately, it cuts easily with a razorblade.  If you cut it
with an angle, like the
manual says, there is no shrinkage below the frame and the angle throws
water away from
the seal.

Works pretty good over all.

&gt; &gt;I have just spent a frustrating 2.5 hours trying to reinstall the
&gt; &gt;glass in ONE of my vent wing windows.  I bought new rubber gasket
&gt; &gt;material from Wolfsburg West, which seems very thick, and I just
&gt; &gt;cannot make it all come together at once.  I can't even the the glass
&gt; &gt;to seat on the forward edge of the frame.
&gt;
&gt; I guess I'm going to have to write this up and keep it on file.
&gt; I used the material from WCM, which seemed to be just right.
&gt; You need two small c-clamps or strong spring clamps. Now remember, Front
is
&gt; Front.
&gt; Starting about 2 inches down from the top on the REAR edge of the glass,
&gt; fold the rubber over the glass
&gt; and clamp it gently but firmly. Stretch the rubber over the top, front
edge,
&gt; bottom and around to the rear edge
&gt; again. It should be stretched enough to reduce it's thickness and allow it
&gt; to press firmly into the frame.
&gt; After the glass/rubber is fully seated into the frame all the way around,
&gt; release the clamps and let it sit
&gt; for about 30 minutes. Do a ROUGH trim of the rubber, leaving about 1/4 in.
&gt; all the way around. Let it sit
&gt; at least overnight to let the rubber draw back fully before the final
trim.
&gt; I would recommend a day or two if
&gt; time allows. After that, trim the rubber flush with the frame and
reinstall
&gt; the unit in the window assembly.
&gt;
&gt; HTH.
