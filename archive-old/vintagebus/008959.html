So... I think I've almost got this blasted motor back together.  I've
measured the deck height, measured the stroke, cc'd the heads, etc. etc.
Looks like I need to put .060&quot; shims in all four cylinders, for a
compression ratio of 7:1.  I am using my old cylinders, had them honed a bit
so they look pretty good.  Put on new rings.  So, to double check this, do I
put the shims on the head side or the engine case side?  I'm thinking they'd
go on the head side, so that the pistons can stay in the same area of the
cylinder, or does that matter with the new rings?  Of course it'd be easier
to put them on the head side too, I always have a hard time getting the
cylinders over the rings and seated against the case properly.

Hoping for good weather so I can get the bus on the road before the weekend,
Diana
