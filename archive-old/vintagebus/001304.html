Hi everyone

just wanted to let you know we now make sundial tents.  Over the last 2
years the most requested product people wanted us to make were tents and now
we do.  Check out our web site under campmobiles and you can find pictures
and info or contact us directly.

In case I have to remove myself again due to time constraints just wanted to
let you know I will be at the OCTO and Classic shows in california on the
12th and 13th.  Swaping at the OCTO (where I will have a green and white
tent displayed) and just hanging out at the Classic.  At the OCTO show I
have also donated one of our &quot;Your Mama's Bras&quot; to the raffle. Hope to see
you there.

Thankyou
