Hey,

If anyone's following the latest adventure of &quot;Everywhere&quot; Ed O'Donnel, he's made it from the Bus Barn in NM to good ole New Yawk City.  The remarkable thing is his newest ride, a 60 walk thru standard that had been heavily modified in the early 70's into a &quot;double cab&quot; stake bed pickup and hasn't seen the road in a thousand years, is doing fine.  Y'oughtta see this thing!  Typical Ed nightmare and currently my new favorite bus.  It's got a beetle swingaxle tranny and no redux boxes so the rear tires look like this: \--/  'cept it's loaded to the gills as usual with bus goodies so it evens out and goes 75 mph too!  Too fast for a bus?  Thats ok, it has no brakes!!!  None yet anyway.  He'll be heading back across the US in a few weeks like some crazed VW Santa Claus, and he wanted me to post his VM and EM in case anyone needs anything, but one thing in particular:

One pair of 72-74 heaterboxes $75
One header system for the above, $35
$100 for both, such a deal.

Contact Ed voice mail 1-800-692-1635
E-Mail TheBusBarn_at_aol_dot_com

I know it's loaf junk and this is the early list, but I'm not on that list anymore.  If someone is, could you forward it to type2?  Besides, he's got all kinds of stuff at decent prices, not just late parts. 

Drive yer bus,
Curt
