&gt; &lt;&lt;I know they were going to have to shut it down eventually because of
&gt; some legal mumbo jumbo and it looks like indeed, the lawyers possibly
&gt; won
&gt; again.&gt;&gt;

The aircooled junkyard didn't shut down as part of the VW Crusade Against
Enthusiasts. They were shut down due to not accepting credit cards, which
was in violation of a local ordinance in Richmond, Ohio. If you frequented
the site you will recall that many of the stories were based on the efforts
of the council to shut them down. They finally got it done. If you
frequented the site, you would also have noticed the final story, which
detailed all of this, which was up for several months after the closing of
the site was posted on the list here. More an example of a tyrannical city
council than any other thing. While VWOA's handling of their trademark
protection has been overly exuberant, they are an innocent bystander in this
case. Even though there is plenty of reason to not like them, energies spent
railing against their tactics would be better spent on situations that are
actually relevant. Do a Dejanews search on
rec.alt.makers.volkswagen.aircooled for VWOA and you should find a lifetime
supply of stories of their dealings. Then, go about despising them for good
cause.
