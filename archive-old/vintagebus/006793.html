for those that care, 1275.00 outright, was 1250.00 but there was a slight
price increase a month ago, shipping is 100 dollars or less anywhere in the
48 states.
3 to 5 day delivery time depending on where your at, and yes for those that
asked I will do a couple of single port conversions, add 175.00 to cost of
engine. New OEM single port heads cost more then duel port, go figure.

I don't like posting business prices to the list but this will save me a lot
of time answering the inquires by email and phone. sorry for the bandwidth

&gt; I am leaning toward option b, Mexican longblock, 
&gt; ala Ronnie.
&gt;  i got mine from cali imports. it
was $1195, which was the cheapest that i could find.
RMMW had the exact same motor for $1495 + core. both
had core charges. try to talk them out of the core
charge. tell them that you are buying a NEW engine.
