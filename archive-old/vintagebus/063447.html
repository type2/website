Subject: Re: Internal pipe wrench/ hardware stores

&gt;I am currently in Indiana on business (I am from the UK) and would like
&gt;to get one of these internal pipe wrenches so that I might be able to
&gt;solve my loose oil filler problem - however I am not sure what is meant
&gt;by a hardware store - let alone the names of businesses I should try.

Home Depot and Lowe's are large national chains that may have what you
want.  These are bigger stores that sell hardware, lumber, electrical
supplies, plumbing supplies, doors and windows, appliances (Lowe's), etc.
There are also smaller stores that don't sell the big items like lumber
and appliances and may be slightly more likely to have what you want.
Two chains of note are Ace Hardware and True Value Hardware.  Often
these won't be in the phone book under just &quot;Ace&quot; or &quot;True Value&quot; - they
have &quot;real&quot; names like &quot;Bob's Ace Hardware&quot; or &quot;Smith True Value.&quot; The
other advantage of these smaller stores is that the clerks are much more
likely to have a clue what you are asking about.

One possible solution is to find the maintenance man for your hotel and
ask him or her where to buy an internal pipe wrench - they will know
for sure.  You might want to explain that you're not planning on taking
anything in your room apart.  :)

Good luck!
