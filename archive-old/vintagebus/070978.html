Subject: RE: [VB] mcode 197

Hey Greg,

Yes, the firebus is geared quite low... or so it seams.  Its *screaming*
past 90 km/hour.  I asked earlier when I first got it if it was possible
to change the gear ratios in the rgbs... instead of reworking the whole
trans.

Let me know what your swiss bus has for mcodes.

David

&gt;Well after having the firebus for a few months, I finally went through
&gt;the mcodes. and it has mcode 197 which Everett describes as possibly a
&gt;swiss option.  does anyone have any further thoughts on this?

How is your Firebus geared?

My Swiss Highroof is geared very low (60-65 top speed low) I'm not sure 
if it has M code 197, but I'll check.
