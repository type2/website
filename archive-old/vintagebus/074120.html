Subject: Re: [VB] Brake &amp; Shift(Minor) issue??

The flex hose suggestion was good.  old flex hoses are a PITA.   

other thing that can happen is that the shoe end might not be set down into the cylinder slot, but turned slightly.  

also, sometimes the shoe have to set into the middle.   a few stomps on the brakes should do this, then sometimes it needs readjusting.

&gt; etc...  I can adjust must the brakes most of the way off and 95% of the sound
&gt; goes away.  Question is what do I look for when I pull the wheel?  Maybe a
&gt; show dragging?  Slipped off of the retainer?  rock in the 
&gt; shoe?
