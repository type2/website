Subject: Re: [VB] Restoring front beam and greasing it!


&gt; &gt; I don't think he did - one of the king pins had to be adjusted for its 
&gt; &gt; yearly test however since I have owned it I have greased it twice - when
I 
&gt; &gt; got it and then after 1250 miles.
&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; Sounds like you are talking about the link pins!  King pins are not 
&gt; adjustable.

Probably!  I have only greased the front end - nothing else so haven't had
to read the manual properly.

&gt; Use a hydralic jack and axle stands under the front beam to get it up off
the 
&gt; front wheels.  Then build a Lincoln log kind of stack of 30&quot; long 4&quot;x4&quot;s 
&gt; under the frame of the bus just behind of the front beam.  Remove the
wheels, 
&gt; the front link shift rod (probably the hardest part of the job), take aprt

&gt; the link pins to allow removal of the spindles and brakes to lighten the
next 
&gt; step, and drop out the front beam.

I am not sure what you mean by Lincoln log kind of stack - is it like
triangle stack when viewing from the side?
Do I place it on the part of the frame running from side to side - where the
rails that run the length of the bus connect?

&gt;   We use the same stack of wood to remove the tranny.  It is far more
stable 
&gt; than even jack stands.  There was someone on this list a while ago that 
&gt; shoved his tranny in place and knocked his bus off the jack stands,
pinning 
&gt; him to the floor under the bus!!

Ouch - I certainly don't want that happening - was he hurt badly?  That
sounds much more stable especially as it will be in the air for a while I
would imagine!

Thanks a lot for your help
Paul
