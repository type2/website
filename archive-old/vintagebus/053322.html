Subject: Re: [VB] Heater Box connecting tubes?

Warning, the plastic tubes are not plastic on the inside. The air temp
coming out of the heater boxes is high enough to melt most plastics. I know,
I've tried it. Use a flexible metal duct and wrap it with fiber-glass
insulation.

Subject: [VB] Heater Box connecting tubes?


&gt; Since it is like 70 in Atlanta today I thought I would ask what a good
&gt; alternative to the plastic heater box connectors are?
&gt;
&gt; I am sure Home Depot will have something I can piece together to work for
&gt; now...  Any ideas?  In the past I think I have seen people use flexible
&gt; exhaust pipe.  Kind of thinking a small dryer vent pipe will work if I can
&gt; find a small one.
&gt;
&gt; I think I have a set that will fit but requires the engine to come out to
&gt; fit in right... Not going to pull the engine for that, figure a new excuse
&gt; to pull it will be coming sooner than later anyway :)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
