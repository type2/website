Hi everyone,
 I  don't know if anyone has posted anything about techniques on polishing
aluminum trim, because I don't have easy internet access, so at the risk of
being redundant, here goes.  I've unsuccessfully tried various techniques,
including high RPM  buffing wheels and rouge, cotton cloths zip-tied to sanding
pads on the drill, and more.  My last two techniques are as follows:

My old technique of polishing al trim:
1. Block sand with 220 grit wet sand paper (using a file at really rough areas)
2. Sand by hand with 320, then 400, then 600 then 800.  Whew!
3. Polish by hand using polishing cream (mothers Mag / Aluminum polish, or the
like).  A few days and sore forearms and blisters later you end up with a
beautiful piece.   

I've figured the sanding and prepwork (steps 1 &amp; 2) takes about  an hour a foot
depending on how badly its oxidized or dinged up, and step three the same.  Also
if the piece is curved you might have to do it on you lap.   It's a great
feeling when completed,  it just looks so good when installed with new rubber
inserts.  So a 10 foot piece will take me about 20 hours!

My new technique of polishing al trim:
1. Same
2. Same
3. Get a piece of real sheepskin and attach it to a vibrating sander.  Apply
generous amounts of cream polish and let her rip for a few minutes.  Buff out
the section with a clean cloth, and reapply generous amounts and do it again. 
The only thing to watch out for is that the sander gets a little warm and tends
to dry out the cream, and dry cream doesn't work so well.  So allow for a little
cooling time.

Steps 1 &amp; 2 about 1 hour a foot and the new and improved step 3  ===&gt;  15-20
minutes a foot!  So a 10 foot piece will only take me 11 to 12 hours from start
to finish!

I don't know if any one else has done this, but it saved my butt.  I figured out
the vibrating sander when I was on my last piece of trim - the dreaded 10
footer!  I was faced with the challenge to complete step three the night before
I needed it done.  Using the vibrating sander - 2 hours later it was done!  I
was able to go to bed at a decent hour, which was great because I planned on it
being up to a 10 hour job.  :)


I have a few questions for the list:

*does any one else have a better technique?  (I haven't tried the vibrating
sander for steps 1 &amp; 2 yet, and I may)

*Does anyone know if there is anything I can spray / brush on to prolong me
having to do this again? (I've heard of a clear powder paint for this, but have
never seen results or have heard of long term effects - any comments?)

*Does anyone recommend any product that will allow me to repolish the trim on
the bus, meaning Its taken me two years to actually complete polishing all of
the trim (newborn son factor)  and now that I'm actually done the piece I worked
two years ago has slightly dulled.  I don't want to take it off to re-polish. 
Any suggestions?


Thanks,
George of Portland Or.
