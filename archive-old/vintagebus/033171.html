Subject: Re: [VB] Frozen Brakes
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

 &gt; Ok, this 1966 bus thing is new to me. I drag the bus down off the car dolly
 &gt; and it sits askew off my driveway. The back brakes are frozen somehow, &gt;&gt;

Jon Furst and I picked up a bus in the mountains a few days ago, and dragged 
it onto my trailer with one rear wheel frozen and not turning at all (snow is 
a good lubricant for this).

After getting back to the shop, Jon squirted a penetrant into the brake 
adjuster hole in all directions, and, lo and behold, the wheel turns.  Don't 
know about getting the drum off, but we got it off the trailer.
