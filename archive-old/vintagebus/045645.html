&lt;&lt; t seems to me that one of the more high-tech adtermarket suppliers (maybe
 Gene Berg?) used to offer an oil cooler kit with a thermostat.  The
 thermostat routed the oil right back into the engine until a certain
 temperature was reached.  I wonder if thoses are still available?
  &gt;&gt;
I think Bernie Bergman (I think thats the name) sells a set up like that. 
cooler thermostat and electric fan. He also does alot of the type I/II 
hydrolic lifter engines, Does anyone have any experience with these? Never 
adjusting my valves again sure sounds good. I've heard good things but 
nothing on longevity.
