Honestly, I (but I am only 1 listee) think license plate frames would be more
feasible.  I would like to show my support of the list but I don't do
stickers.  All states require a rear plate (mine requires both). Vanity front
plates only get seen in parking lots and in the horrible event of a head-on
collision.  Has anyone checked out these as an option?
