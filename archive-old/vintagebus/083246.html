Subject: Throttle cable replacement

Hi,

What are the dangers of pulling out the throttle cable for replacement? I 
have visions of pulling out the old one and not being able to thread the new 
one thru. Or worse yet, the old one getting stuck on the way out and no way 
to pull it back.

I once tied a thin string to the carb end of the cable just below the barrel 
so that I could pull it back if it got stuck. What do you know, it got stuck 
about a foot into the tube. Almost could not pull it back out with the 
string.

Does the cable eventually cut a slot somewhere in the tube?

I have a double door with a belly pan, so the tube is not accessable without 
great headache.

Chris
