List:

The '59 Westfalia was ready,  I thought.  For all intent purposes it was complete.  I even had the tent and poles packed up and ready.  I had caught my second wind after the last 9 month power push to get this bus ready, 2 year resto in total.  The bus was finished, clean and ready to roll.  I had a lunch packed for the trip, my spirits were up, this would be my first VW meet in 3 years that I actually got to drive a VW to.

The last thing completed on my machine was the motor.  Not because I had put it off, but because it just took that long to get all the pieces.  There were a few bugs that popped up last week, but after a few short around-town and freeway road trips, we thought as of Wednesday night that she was ready for the LONG journey of 120 miles down to Orange County.

Joe Crockett, aka Mr. Transporter Talk, rolled up at 4:45 ready for a 5:00 pm departure.  Joe had been a huge technical resource along the way of this resto.  5:10 we're on the road, naturally in bumper to bumper traffic.  We knew it would open up just outside of Santa Barbara, and it did.  Ready to get this 36hp up to speed, I shift into 4th and away we go.  For about ½ mile.  Keep in mind the bus cruised beautifully at 62 mph Wednesday night.  All of a sudden at around 56-58 it starts cutting out, violently.  I'm literally doing the herky-jerky, coming close to banging my head on the windshield.  We pull over in Carpinteria for inspection.  This problem had occured last week, and it seemed to be determined that the cause was a timing adjustment and a faulty vacuum advance, so it had been disconnected.

To make a long story short, we dicked with it until just after 10:00pm, when it was decided that the bus just wouldn't make it.  We even consdiered trailering it down there, but just didn't seem doable considering the time restraints.  Joe asked if I still wanted to go down, but I was so depressed that I decided against it.  I had worked so hard on this bus to have it ready for this one day.  It had been my goal for two years now.  I was only 120 miles from where I needed to be and couldn't even get there.

I think what bummed me out the most was that I actually felt like I let a lot of people down.  I had told countless folks that I would be there.  I had parts to bring to people, Dave Easterwood, Steve Harris, made specific plans to hook up with David Mayes and give him a ride from the hotel to the meet, etc.  My buddy Dave Kroesen, (who was in his sweet ~new swr/bgr hatchtop Westy, that I'm sure you all saw and loved) was sitting in the hotel waiting for me to show, as he and I were going to set up the buses next to each other, something we have planned on for 2 years now,  This was the year!!!  I just felt like a big, stupid flake.  For God's sake, people drive across the country and I can't even make it down the road a couple of counties.  Man I felt like a loser.

I hope everyone had a great weekend.  I've been trying to look at the upside to this weekend.  I suppose now I can continue to work on the camper and complete it for a meet later on in the Summer.  I think I'll shoot for Familienfest in August, as I've never been to that meet and I hear it's a nice one.  The only drawback is the bus should be finished by then and I won't be able to use the &quot;it's still under construction&quot; line that my good friend Mr. Ellis recommended, when people start pointing out all of the flaws of my restoration.

Sorry again to those that I promised I would be there.  I truly gave it my best shot, but it just wasn't good enough.

Robert
