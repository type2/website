Subject: My employment  (&amp; free upper cot offer!)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.3.95.990510093734.16588B-100000_at_mallard2&gt;

(as long as this thread has run, I figure  I had to sweeten the pot to
get anyone to read it)  Free upper cot (from a junk '71), ripped canvas.
You pay shipping.  I'll be glad to clear out shed space.

Now to the trivial stuff:
 I am a library worker, handling preservation restoration and rebinding
services.   Low pay, but it's in Alabama, so it's enough to survive.
Also in grad school (with a 4.0 average), but am considering bailing out.
Tired of burning the candle at both ends.

I live in a little &quot;intentional community&quot;  (unenlightened folks might
call us a commune) in Fredonia, AL.   We're all committed to organic
gardening, non-violent activism, and simple living.  My family and I live
in a 100+ year old farmhouse that is constantly in dire need of one fix or
another.  We rescued it from the brink of death, and have been paying for
that decision for 3 years.   Wow, my house is just like like my Westy!
Both are headaches, but I love 'em.

Greg
