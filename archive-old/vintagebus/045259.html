Hi Thom,
Thanks, that is great news!  When I was working at the Wolfburg Warehouse
those cables were selling at $50.00 NOS.  By the way we have been making a
list of VW meets for N. America and have been wanting to get the info into
the event calender on the type2 web site, but that area has been down for
months.  Do you know if it is going to be up and running anytime soon?
Thanks again, Eric&amp;Barb
