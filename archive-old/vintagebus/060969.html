Subject: Re: [VB] VDO Oil Pressure sender

There are two VDO pressure senders, a two and a one 
terminal. The two terminal sender has an on/off 
connection and an analog for the guage. Nope, you can't 
hook the idiot light to the guage. Get the correct type 
if you want the idiot light to work. I recommend it.

&gt; My gauges and senders came in today. The oil pressure sender only has 
&gt; one terminal on it and I though it would have two:one for the VDO 
&gt; gauge and one for the stock idiot light. Can I hook both up to the 
&gt; same terminal or will that mess everything up?
