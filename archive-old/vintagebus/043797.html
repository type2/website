&gt;
&gt;I need a few ['63 single cab] electrical parts and hope someone or a 
&gt;few listees can help me out:
&gt;
&gt;floor-mounted hi/lo beam switch

Because you have this...

&gt;headlight relay

you don't need this.  The floor-stomp switch does it all.  If you
are talking about the relay you found halfway between the heater duct
and the passenger door jamb, on that rail right below the front edge
of the parcel shelf, that's for your hazard lights.  US-spec Buses
didn't have a relay for high beam/low beam until '66.

I'll put in my standard plug for http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/index.html .

I hope this helps!

Matt Roberds
