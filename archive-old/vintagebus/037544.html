&lt;&lt; OPTION 1: 1 inch tube connected to 211 129 511 (A) - This is the metal 
tube 
 which bolts to some part of the exhaust system to draw air off of or near 
 head #2 or #4 (I have never seen it).  &gt;&gt;
Hi Tom,
That is the best way to do it!  The original tube bolts to the lower stud 
that also secures the muffler to the rear of the head.
  You can easily modify the rear (FIF) under head tin by drilling or cutting 
a hole in the tin and welding or screwing a tube the correct size to fit 
inside of the paper preheat tube.  
Using a take off from the heater is not such a good idea due to the fact that 
the hot air produced in that area is pressurized and will keep the aircleaner 
flap open too much.   Eric&amp;Barb
