Subject: Re: [VB] Harber Freight Sandblaster

Get the biggest compressor your budget and wife will allow.
*Minimum* 5hp 60 gal.   Don't even think of getting an oilless.
Shop around for a used one - I got my compressor used for $200
and it's served me well for several project cars.  The only
maintenance I've had to do is change the oil and replace the
starter one time.

&gt; So since I havn't bought the compressor what minimum spec's would people recommend. I would like to run a sand/media blaster and a nibbler. Would also like to do some painting a later date. Any recommendations ouwl be appreciated.
