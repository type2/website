Subject: splittie update

hi all,
    i just got through sanding the roof of my '67. it wasnt that bad of rust 
but it hurts my friggen hands. i will try to get some pics of it when my 
aunt gets her digital camera working again. i also popped the dents on the 
roof back out, i had to take the wood panel out from the camper kit. im goin 
to sleep in her tonight. well thats the update for now,
                                        josh 1967 panel convert
                                         &quot;she will soon be reborn&quot;  \X/
