&gt;So I know Bob Hoover did a study on propane and decided it wasn't feasible
&gt;but I must admit with rising gas prices and my workmate friend John's nice
&gt;clean oil dipstick after 3 years and 90,000 miles on his Ford V8, I've
&gt;thought about it.  With my T4 project that I want to start after my ebay
&gt;marathon is overwith,  I just might put this little doodad to use.  It's
&gt;easy to add-on and try - easy to remove when you get pissed off because it
&gt;doesn't work.  I'm aware of the power loss incurred by burning propane but
&gt;after building this 1776 engine, I have a totally newfound respect for a
&gt;stock and reliable design

There was  a bus in seattle that ran on propane. I never got to talk to the 
guy, but he had two tanks lying on the roof lengthwise. Must have had 100 
pounds of propane or more. Seems like the loss in power plus the wweight of 
large tanks must necessitate a large engine. However a 1776 would seem to 
get you back into the ballpark of a least a stock engine in terms of 
performance. I also believe that many states will compensate you some (lower 
registration etc) for using only propane.

Good luck. I have been wanting to do this for years.
