Subject: BNNTA update...

Hi all,

We just got the latest long-range weather update and it is forecast to be
spectacular for the entire Labor Day holiday weekend!!!  Sunny skies, temps
topping out at only 85 degrees, and lower than usual levels of humidity!

The Rangers are looking forward to the arrival of our Buses and enthusiasts,
and have again offered to open the gates to our private group campground a day
early to accomodate any early arrivals.  The gates now &quot;should be&quot; open to
VW's at around noon on Thursday.  The 22 mile long Mark Twain Lake is in great
shape so bring your water toys!

Take it easy on those gas pedals on the way here, and we'll commiserate about
fuel and our best MPG over the appropriate beverages around the campfire.  At
least the camping/event fee is as low as it gets at any VW campout, only $25
for the entire four-day event/holiday weekend!  For info go to:

Drive safely and enjoy your Type 2 wherever you'll be this weekend! We hope to
see you soon!

the Bowman's
