&lt;&lt;check ebay--
There is one on there right now.._dot_complete, but pricey... Starts around 200$ 
I think
Good luck-Pete&gt;&gt;

Thanks for the tip, but get this all. The guy selling this particular sunroof 
on ebay is the same one who sold my buddy the bus and said he already sold 
the sunroof on top of other things. My buddy made the mistake and showed too 
much interest in the bus before he saw it, which is where he messed up, but 
it is just mesed up that people would take advantage of other people like 
that. At least there are far fewer people like this in teh VW community than 
other autos, but it still irks the crap out of me. I already sent him a nice 
letter with a piece of my mind, and when I call my buddy up tomorrow, he is 
probably going to flip. Next time someone wants to flame on someone, email 
this guy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry all, had to vent.
