Subject: Re: [VB] undercover cops at jerome


Rachel's inquiry is relevant to people who believe in their right to
personal privacy.  Across the street from the VW Bus Camp at Burning Man
two weeks ago 3 people running the Spaghetti Western Camp got busted for
smoking something in their own camp site.  This is after feeding maybe
300 people nice spaghetti dinners absolutely free.  A wind down smoke.
Not a nice reward.  Good people should not have to worry about the red
coats busting down their doors.    Gary Gibson
