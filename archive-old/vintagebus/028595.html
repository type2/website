Before my 1964 21 Window Deluxe, I owned a 1996 Hummer Wagon with a 6.5
turbo diesel engine.
In the three years / 30,000 that I owned this truck, I replaced:
 Two air conditioners
 Two rear axles
 Two sets of brakes ( 2 _at_ 1,200 each job - turns out that they are jeep
brakes on a 8,500 pound truck)
 Two front geared hubs
 Three transfer cases
 (crash required replacement of hood, brush guard)
 10 tires _at_ 350 ea
 and I am sure there is more.

But on it defense, I did sink it under water once!

Answer: lowest military bidder.

The VW Van is better, and has never left me stranded.  It also does not cost
$100,000.  Hummer's stink

&gt; &gt; &gt; American society is becoming more and more &quot;needy&quot; and
&gt; &gt; &gt;  dependant on others instead of themselves, watch the news all it is
is a
&gt; &gt; &gt;  bunch of crybabies whining for more help and government protection
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Which brings to mind the ever so common recall.  Seems day after day
piece by
&gt; &gt; piece you learn how crappy your car was built.  Does anyone know of any
types
&gt; &gt; of recalls with the bus.  I know the bastard 40 was discontinued but
havent
&gt; &gt; heard of any recalls.
&gt;
&gt; I think that a lot of stuff that is subject to recall today was just
&gt; considered to be a &quot;trait&quot; of a vehicle a couple of decades ago.
&gt;
&gt; For example, we know that early Bay steering boxes are relatively fragile,
&gt; and that they were replaced with a more robust unit in late bays.  These
&gt; days, such a change would probably be a recall, since it is safety
&gt; related.
&gt;
&gt; There's also a lot of recalls because of emissions equipment.
&gt; Essentially, the manufacturers have to guarantee that their engines will
&gt; remain in perfect tune for 5 years.  Imagine trying to drive your VW for 5
&gt; years without touching the ignition or carburator!
