FYI

I bought a 1964 Standard Bus from Jonathan &amp; Tracy Moore of Eugene, Oregon.
They were very upfront, honest and easy to deal with. They did everything
they said they would do and more ref. the Bus. I drove the bus home to
Chicago, IL without ANY problems.

They have a ghia for sale and might have a bug for sale in the near future.
I def. recommend them to anyone looking for a vw.
