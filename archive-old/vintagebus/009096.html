&gt; you guys are amazing....the response time is faster than my bus going down
a
&gt; really steep hil with a tailwind.
&gt; i have gotten a few replies suggesting NAPA, and STA-Lube. I think I went
&gt; looking for this last year, up in boston. The STA lube stuff was GL-4 and
GL-5
&gt; rated, I thought this was supposed to be bad, and I had to use stuff that
was
&gt; solely gl-4 rated?

Correct, on the right stuff, the label will only have GL 4 on it
