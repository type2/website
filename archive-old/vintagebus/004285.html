At first I suspected a blown plug but if it still runs great, then closely
inspect your tires.  I was riding with my grandmother in her Ford Galaxy 500
back in the early 80's - Dad was driving.  Then all of a sudden -
BANG -whuppa-whuppa-whuppa.  Dad pulled over, checked the rear end and
seemingly nothing was wrong. We took off again and this time just the whuppa
noise.

As it turns out, the tread had seperated on the tire but not some off.  Once
parked, it layed back down and everything appeared okay but the minute you
took off, the tread started slapping the fender making the whuppa noise
again.  The tire still held air.

I wouldn't be surprised if those Firestones you are running started to
seperate but just didn't blow yet. :-)  Seriously though, if it might be
related the rotation of the tires, pull the suspected one of and examine the
tread for looseness.  Might even put the put on jackstands and carefully
start it and put it in gear so you can get out and look at it and observe
any tire failure.
