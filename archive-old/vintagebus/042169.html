&gt; any good insurance rates/companies for those of us who drive our busses
&gt; daily?  i have state farm right now, and rachel has geico.  i know it
&gt; depends alot on driving records and coverage desired, but i have no blems
&gt; on my record and am looking for somebody who gives good replacement values,
&gt; and who might have a clue as to what old vw's are &quot;worth&quot;.  thanks.

In California, I do pretty well with Mercury.  20th Century won't insure
vehicles as old as my VWs.

I wouldn't touch geico with a 10-foot pole.  The do nasty things like
give free radar guns to police departments.  Pure revenue enhancement.
they also push radar cameras.
