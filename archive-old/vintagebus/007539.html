I get the same thing, &quot;why dont you include bay window Trucks??&quot; I mail them
back saying sure, you help me research all the late model data, provide me
with pics, give me year to year specs, and host all the pictures and
files......... and would you believe i never get a reply back? =) I just
cant get excited about devoting disk space and time to bay's..._dot_can you? I
dunno maybe in 20 more years itll be different?

&gt;I'm torn: should I allowe bay-window buses on my site?  I get a lot of
bay-window
&gt;pix uploaded, which I usually shuttle off to the &quot;bay area&quot;  Every time I
allow
&gt;the bay-window section to be indexed, I almost immediately get flack-mail
from
&gt;my fellow split-purists.  But at the same time, I get complaints that I
don't
&gt;support the bay community.  I haven't seen a vb_dot_com style site for
bay-windows -
&gt;does one exist?
