&gt;Baiting me, Rusty one? I heard you bought new windows when they got dirty. I
&gt;know you replace transmissions and engines just because they're due for oil
&gt;changes. 8^) Lots of dirty engines, transmissions and windows at the
&gt;VanBondo Ranch, I even heard he had a milk crate full of distributors that
&gt;need the points set and carbs with dirty fuel filters attached. He got rid
&gt;of the Buick cause the ashtray was full...
-------------------

Naw, Kyle doesn't need and lessons in &quot;baiting.&quot; Yup, Im able to acquire
rare vehicles on a whim and spend endless hours in the garage wrenching on
grease without affecting my career path and marital status. They both stay
the same. When I'm unemployed and in trouble with the Missus I can always go
sleep in &quot;the Barn&quot;. The stockmarket looks at Greenspan only after seeing
what I spend at the FLAPS. I sold the Buick because the lighter broke.
