&gt;  The only thing I noticed was that one of the brake shoes has some cracks in
&gt;  the lining, not like it's going to fall apart or anything but I'm not sure
&gt;  how much of a concern this is.  We're talking about a crack about an inch 
or
&gt;  two long, running vertically up the middle of the brake shoe.
&gt;  
&gt;  The old idiot book really doesn't seem to offer much guidance in the
&gt;  brake-fixing department.  It kinda glossed over everything...  So, thanks 
to
&gt;  everyone for their idiot-proof advice.  I'd be lost without ya.

well, since that shuddering feeling that started in the FL corner of the bus 
the other day that I mentioned in my last post, I took the front drums off 
and took a look.  Me too I had a cracked shoe.  Being cheap and short on time 
and it being a Sunday when no shoes are available I just swapped that shoe 
with one I had around.  I have loads of old brakes shoes for some reason, if 
anyone wants some for cores or something, please let me know.   It doesn't 
shudder anymore, so I must have done something right.   scuffed up the shoes 
and drums again, never hurts.  Think the drums want turning though, but the 
brake place is closed on Sundays.   

Ya, they can fall apart when the are cracked.
