Subject: Re: [VB] Proposed Eastern Washington bus gathering

the current plan is to have it some rempote field in the middle of nowhere
(coulee city area) I am sure that there will be quite a bit of both
activities (talking and beating)  I had also palnned on bringing my smoker
and wowing you all with my smoked pork sandwhices. If someone wanted to
bring some instruments that would make the camp fire even nicer.  I also
thought maybe the attendees might want to bring some spare parts to
sell/trade.  just thoughts at the moment.

&gt;
&gt; Where (in a park, a secluded, remote field in the hills, or a parking lot)
&gt; I'm more of the secluded field type
&gt; What happens (Does everyone want to stand around and talk about their
buses,
&gt; or go beat them with joyous abandon on some semi-dangerous logging road?)
&gt; Bet you can't guess which I'd rather do...
