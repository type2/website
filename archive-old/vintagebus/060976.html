Subject: Re: [VB] '59 SC...Rhino Lining

Hi Rex,
I've got an appointment to get my crew cab bed Rhino
lined next week. The body shop said they can add color
to it and it will be the same color as my existing
bed. (white) I'm also thinking about having the
interior floors done as well.

&gt; Anyone out there had the bed of their truck done
&gt; with Rhino Liner? 
&gt; I'm not gonna be going stock, so considering it as
&gt; an option.
&gt; 
&gt; Also considering making panels for the inside of the
&gt; gates. Can't 
&gt; figure out why they didn't have something in the
&gt; first place. Just 
&gt; like inside a bus, it would keep them from getting
&gt; dinged from the 
&gt; inside out. Thinking about making some panels out of
&gt; sheet metal.
