Subject: stuttering in my 73 thingster

 My 73 thing with a 1600 DP and a 009 distributor seems to halter when I put my foot down on the accelerator when it is running slowly.
I thought it could be a blocked accelerator pump, but I have read that the 009 distributor is not correct with a 1600DPm and I should be using a distributor with a vacuum advance &amp; retard. Is this true?
I will also post this in the thing forum on thesamba_dot_com
