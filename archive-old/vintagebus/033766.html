The biggest problem I find with VW's is the use of a timing light to set the
timing of a non-stock engine.  On a weekly basis I have VW's coming in the
shop complaining about heat and/or running problems, after I look at it the
first thing I do is advance the timing a few degrees  and that usually
solves the problem. Most non stock VW engines that I see are running to
retarded, which in turn causes them to run hot. The only time I use a timing
light is to check the timing after I have set it by ear, so I know where to
set it if I need to make changes to something and to check the advance if
the dizzy. Using a timing light to set the timing on a NON STOCK engine is a
NO NO, but to each there own. 

ronnie,   I can't prove this to you, but my wifes 65 Type 1 with a NEW MEXI
engine gets 30+ mpg with no heat problems (timing set by ear and test
driving up hills) and as most of you know my DD runs like a bat out of hell,
again no timing light.

Question?

While returning from central Oregon last week, (100 + temps) the oil light 
began to glow, this is a 1776, single carb 34pict, has 10 thou balanced with

a CW.

I pulled over &amp; shut off the engine, I checked the oil sensor wire &amp; wiggled

it some, the spade connector moved slightly, anyway started it back up &amp; 
heard nothing except a smooth sounding 1776, the light stayed off, I didn't 
mention it but when I spritz water on the pulley &amp; case sizzle...sizzle, way

to hot. Timing is correct, no obstructions in the fan.

I let things cool about 20 min &amp; took off, Hears the Question If you open
the 
heater box's (heat on) will this help to run cooler?  In this instance I 
would say no, as the oil light came on after a short while. When I shut the 
heater box's I think it ran cooler? as the oil light never came on again, 
although the engine was still to hot, I have no gauges, only 35 years of 
driving air cool buses &amp; bug's &amp; I know what hot smells like.

How about some input from the &quot;real&quot; hot place, Ronnie?
