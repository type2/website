 Does anybody offer a set of used or new taillights and a breaklight combined
 with the licenseplateillumination from 1955 on ? They are so incredible
 expensive here in Germany, so it would be very kind of you making me an
 offer. I´m a student and can´t afford prices around 500 US$ or above like
 here in G. .

Evidently the brakelight/liscence plate bulb holder is difficult to find.  
But the taillights are easier if you use the 3/55 through mid 57 euro style 
taillight that  goes on the semaphore buses.  They have one screw terminal, 
so are ONLY taillights, no turn signals as well.   Flat glass lens.   There 
are a number of these around NOS, seen them for $50 to $80 each.
