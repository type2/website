But that's not what's happening.  Granted, that could *also* be a
problem, it's a 40-year-old carb that sat for ten years - I'll be
doing at least the standard rebuild kit in any case.

But, what I saw was: clean carb, engine off for over eight hours.
Manually operate throttle linkage by pulling on the throttle arm on
the carb.  A drop of gasoline appears on right end of the shaft, and
the left end becomes damp.  At no time was the engine operating during
or before this test.  To me, that means there's a direct relationship
with the operation of the accelerator pump and/or the throttle valve.
Since there was nothing on or around the pump, and given where the
dampness started on both sides, it's pretty obvious I have a leak
there.

I'm still investigating the other problems that were the trigger for
all this in the first place.  However, the above appears to be
relatively independent of them (missing on one cylinder when warm, but
only when the headlights are on, seems more likely to be electrical in
nature).  The gas smell part at low idle when the ignition problem
occurs could be an exhaust leak from the missing cylinder, or a
side-effect of the carb leak (I'd expect the leak to get worse when
things have heated up), and/or a slightly-flaky needle valve, all
exasperated by my hearty pumping of the throttle to get the engine
speed up.  But, as I said, the obvious fuel leak needs to be resolved
first.

Thanks for the suggestion of having Rimco re-bush the carb.
