----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; &gt; Who said anything about hot air recirculating? Tell you what, George, I
&gt; &gt; daily drove my 64 delux while living in Vegas with temps well over 100
&gt; &gt; degrees with no &quot;recirculation&quot; issues with that tin removed. 34 mile
drive
&gt; &gt; to work, half highway, half gridlock on the side streets. Never a
cooling
&gt; &gt; issue with my motor. I ran oil and head temp gauges and monitored what
was
&gt; &gt; going on with my motor.
&gt;
&gt; Look, you have a big fan pushing air out the botton of the bus.  If you
&gt; have a big opening nearby pulling air from the bottom of the bus into the
&gt; engine bay the air is going to take the path of least resistance, which
&gt; means that the air will be recirculated unless there is a big slipstream
&gt; to carry it away.  In addition, the airflow around the rear of a vehicle
&gt; isn't as smooth and predictable as we would like.  You may have gotten
&gt; away with this, but that doesn't mean the the people who follow your
&gt; advice will.
&gt;
George, you have a &quot;theory&quot; that recirculation is a problem with this mod. I
have years of testing on multiple buses that that has never shown any
cooling issues at all. You can argue it all you want I guess, but the proof
is in the pudding.

&gt;
&gt; Yes, you've done the tests but what was the engineer's intent for the
&gt; acceptable pressure drop through the intake ducts?  Unless you have
&gt; happened upon a VW cooling engineer's notebook I doubt that you know any
&gt; more about that than the rest of us.

First hand experience has shown me that the more you reduce engine bay
vacuum (and if you can, create pressure with scoops), the cooler head and
oil temps run. Why do I have to have an engineers notebook to validate that?


&gt; Exactly, and the baywindow scoops don't stick out enough to get out of the
&gt; boundary layer.

Interesting how you came to that conclusion. Then how come at 4000rpm while
sitting still, I can pull water 3 inches up a tube with the engine bay
vacuum, and if i'm doing 4000rpm at 75mph, my engine bay has enough pressure
to force the air 1/2&quot; below the water level? The awnser is simple, the scoop
design works, and works very well at that. George, you've never tested for
vacuum/pressure in aVW engine bay, so you have no ground to stand on. I
have.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; You need to take a close look at the
&gt; &gt; intake design of a bay window a lot better than you have. From the main
&gt; &gt; bodywork, they protrude a full 1 1/2&quot; for the opening from the edge of
the
&gt; &gt; body line. Then look inside the scoop and you'll see it slopes inward
quite
&gt; &gt; aggresivley. This allows the air to follow the bodyline and take even
more
&gt; &gt; advantage of the &quot;scoop&quot; effect. You're way off on your thought on this
one.
&gt;
&gt; Get out your ruler again.  At its _maximum_ extent, the &quot;scoop&quot;
&gt; extends _one_ inch from the body, and most of the scoop extends less than
&gt; this value.  I'm being generous here and measuring to the outside of
&gt; the rounded lip, not to the inside of the opening.  The &quot;scoops&quot; are
&gt; located at the far aft end of the bus, ensuring that the scoop is well
&gt; within the boundary layer.  Since you're a &quot;try it yourself&quot; guy, I
&gt; suggest that you stick your finger one inch outside the window while
&gt; driving your bus and see how much slipstream you feel.

You're the one that needs to take a tape measure out to a bay window again.
It is a full 1 1/2&quot;. My 79 Westy is parked right outside. I've double
checked this measurement just now. It is 1 1/2&quot;.  Another reason why
&quot;theory&quot; has to take a back seat to actual testing. You seem to think that
sticking your finger outside the bus is going to tell you all you need to
know about if the bay window scoops ram air or not. Do some actuall
vacuum/pressure testing and you'll see they do a very good job. Again,
&quot;theory&quot; holds no ground to actual testing. If you don't understand that,
then i'm very sorry for you.

&gt; Sorry, but I just can't believe that you would recommend dirt road driving
&gt; without a front tin.  Even with a well-sealed engine bay more dust than I
&gt; like will infiltrate during dirt road travel.  Without a front tin a huge
&gt; amount of dust will get into the engine bay, cooling ductwork, and air
&gt; filter.

I've done a lot of bus cruises that cover dirt roads. My engine bay
collected no more dirt than any of the others on our cruise. A true side by
side comparison if you will. Same drive and all. Again, &quot;theory&quot; taking a
back seat to actual testing. Are you starting to see a pattern here, George?


&gt; When I said &quot;quick fix&quot; I was referring to the simple discarding of the
&gt; front tin.  I have much less problem with well-engineered modifications,
&gt; such as cooling air ducted through the front tin from the front of the
&gt; bus.  At least in this case, the modifier considered a way to achieve the
&gt; desired result without causing other problems.

No offense to anybody, but &quot;well-engineered&quot; is not the correct term. The
reason that mod works is because it relieves the intake restriction to the
engine bay. People that do this mod have the idea that they are providing
&quot;cool air&quot; into the engine bay with it. It does lower the engine temp, but
not because of how they think its working. &quot;Well-engineered&quot; means they know
how and why it works.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; But what it comes down to, George, is that you have ZERO experience in
&gt; &gt; testing for engine bay vacuum, ZERO experience in testing for what
effect is
&gt; &gt; has on the cooling system, ZERO effect on monitoring fan shroud pressure
in
&gt; &gt; regard to head temps and engine bay vacuum, and ZERO experience in
testing
&gt; &gt; how a bus engine will run with the front tin removed. But you try to
hold an
&gt; &gt; arguement against actual results that I have gathered with ideas that
what I
&gt; &gt; have done. The results i've gathered so clearly knock out the points you
try
&gt; &gt; to argue that I can't understand what ground you are trying to hold.
&gt;
&gt; I suggest that you check to see what work I _have_ done before making
&gt; such accusations.  This topic has been discussed previously although
&gt; the discussion centered upon missing engine bay seals, not discarding
&gt; the front tin.  I measured the difference in inlet and engine bay
&gt; temperatures and found the delta T to be about 3C under the
&gt; same conditions with good seals.  The important result was that missing
&gt; engine seals make a _big_ difference in engine bay temperatures, on the
&gt; order of 10-15C, due to recirculation.  Whether you acknowlege it or not,
&gt; recirculation can occur.

Again, ZERO experience with engine bay vacuum/pressure. You've measured
engine bay temperature compared to outside air temp? Big whoop-idy-doo,
that's not vacuum/pressure testing like I pointed out. I've gone another
step further than you have though with engine bay vs. outside air temp. I've
measured that difference of engine bay vacuum vs. outside air temp with the
front tin missing, and with the front tin installed. Do you want to know the
results, or do have a theory and no matter what figures I got from actual
testing you'll argue it anyway? Ah, what the hell, i'll tell you anyway.
With the tin installed, the air temp entering the fan (that's where I put
the sensor) was 20-25 degrees hotter on the highway than the outside air
temp. Want to guess what it was with the engine tin removed? The air temp
going into the fan was the exact same as the outside temp. Interesting. Even
sitting parked in stop and go traffic where your &quot;theory&quot; of recirculating
air is the issue, the air temp into the fan didnt' increase. Now, I do have
a &quot;theory&quot; for you. I think the reason for the increased airtemp going into
the fan came because of the engine bay vacuum all the stock tin provides.
Even if you have all you tin and seals in place, there are still small
airgaps that hot air from underneat can come through, and if the engine bay
is under vacuum, then it is pulling hot air from anywhere it can to feed the
fan.

&gt;
&gt; I haven't and don't intend to test my bus without a front tin, because I
&gt; understand the function of that tin and I have no intention of running
&gt; without it.  I'd just as soon go without the windshield.

No, without any testing on your part, you don't have any understanding of it
at all.

&gt; I'm sorry you feel that way,  but the fact is that you are promoting
&gt; radical changes in the cooling system while ignoring the obvious
&gt; downsides.

What downsides? Everything you've pointed out in &quot;theory&quot;, i've given
firsthand experience taken over a number of years on multiple buses to
counter any doubt. Just because you're unable to undersand it, doesn't mean
it's wrong or doesn't work.

&gt; If my pointing out these downsides causes you distress there
&gt; is little I can do about it.

Uh, you could do the testing for yourself. That's an idea. You can't shoot
down first hand experience with &quot;theory&quot;. Plain and simple.

&gt; You may have had satisfactory results in
&gt; your particular situation, but those results may not be realized by
&gt; other bus owners, and in fact your changes may cause severe problems
&gt; for them.  They can read all sides of the discussion and make their own
&gt; decisions.

I've done these mods to a number of buses over the course of years. I've
monitored head, oil, and fan intake air temps. I have all the first hand
experience. George has &quot;theory&quot; and no actual first hand experience with
running a VW engine with the front tin removed.

I agree, let others read both sides (although without any experience with
testing it himself, I don't know that George has a &quot;side&quot;) and decide for
themselves.

As for me, i've tried to share my hard work with the community, and I get
the impression that it's a waste of my time. George, you can have the last
word on this if you want, i'm done with it.

Later.
