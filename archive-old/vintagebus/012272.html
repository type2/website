Subject: crew cab headliners
Date: Fri, 11 Dec 1998 08:02:20 -0500
Message-ID: &lt;19981211130048.AAA15448_at_custsrv1.vitts_dot_com_at_gary.vitts_dot_com&gt;

I've recently become the owner of an early 62 crewcab. The truck is minus a
complete interior (do have front and rear seats) but my question pertains
to the headliner. After going thru the catalogs of various vendors I only
seem to be able to find vinyl headliers for crews 64-67. I had a 61 single
that had the thin rigid type headliner that slipped into channels and held
up by tension (for lack of a better word). Are the early crews the same?
Mine has a channel around the perimeter of the roof so it looks like it may
be. Does anyone now of a vendor who supplies these? Does anyone have a set
they'd either be willing to part with or be kind enough to use as a
template and draw me a pattern? I'd be more than happy to compensate for
time and materials.
Thanks,
Gary
62 crew
