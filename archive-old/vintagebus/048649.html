&gt;anyone asks, i dont know why my friend wont wear a mask. 

I find the same thing with some of the independant paint and body guys
around here. I just can't figure it out. I tried to spray some paint one
time with just a little dust mask and walked out after 5 minutes with a
feeling like my nervous system was gonna go into shock. I went back in with
my respirator and will NEVER do that again. These guys proudly walk around
with paint on their nose hairs. I just don't get it.

Reminds me of my granpa who won't wear his seatbelt. He'll sit there
holding it to make it &quot;look&quot; like he's wearing it, but NOOOOO, he won't
latch it. Nobody's gonna tell him what to do. Makes more sense just to have
to hold it....right?

Everyone wear your masks!!!!!
