Only on a crank drilled for 8 dowels is the 1 pin offset, on a standerd 4
hole crank and flywheel it will go on any which way, to many times have I
seen flywheels and/or cranks drilled backwards for the 8 dowel and went they
went to put the flywheel on there was no way it would fit, bummer. So look
at the end of your crank and you will notice that 1 dowel will be offset and
a little closer to the rest, hopefully the wasted dowels are the ones from
the additional 4 dowels and not 1 of the originals, if thats the case your
in good shap, if not ouch. You could take the flywheel to a shop and have
them drill just the 1 offset for you, this is not the best way but will
work, then you'll only have to worry about oil leaks through the extra dowel
hole. Another fix and I have had this done before is that they can drill the
crank while still in the case for oversize dowels, just set it up in a drill
press or prefeally a milling machine and drill out to oversize, then do the
same to the flywheel, just another way to save a crank.

ps. if you ever looked at a crank from Barret or most of the other VW rag
parts whores most of there cranks have had the dowels plugged and redrilled,
they can get them cheaper that way, those people buy all the junk cranks
from the same place I get my good ones from, but I do pay a lot more then
the cheapo places, but I do get good cranks, no dowel plugs, no welded
journels, like most of the cheap cranks out there. The way it works is if I
turn in a standard crank with a wasted journel, they will charge me for a
weld, oh no i say no welded journels take it to 20 under if you have to, if
I have oblonged or wasted dowels they will charge for a plug and drill,
again oh no I say, these cranks I end up giving them and when they repair
them they go to the vw rag whores who have no morals. NQ can contest to
that, (his welded heads) another subject I won't go into.

I learned a couple of tidbits today:

1) If you have a crank drilled for 8 holes and a flywheel drilled with 4
(or vise versa), it is a good idea to fill the unused holes with half
dowels, to provide a little extra strength around the dowels that are
actually in place.

2) I am told that the 4 holes in my new flywheel are NOT 90 degrees
apart, and if I turn my flywheel just right, it should match up to the
unused holes on my 8 hole crank. Apparently, this is the way all cranks
and flywheels are drilled (with one hole slightly offset) to ensure that
if the crank and flywheel are balanced together, they will remain
balanced together after teardown and reassembly. This makes sense to me,
now I'm just waiting for it to stop raining so I can test out this new
information... Maybe I won't have to remove all those dowels, after all!

More later,
david
