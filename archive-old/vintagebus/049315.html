I've pulled apart engines with 1/4&quot;+ of caked on dirt on the fan and fins. Not much heat getting through that muck I suspect. Recently pulled a 914 engine apart with huge amounts of leaves and pine needles aroung the cyls and heads, but that was caused by horizontal air intakes and parking under trees. 

My DC has a film of oil and dirt in the engine room, and on the engine because everything goes through the engine. I suspect an unhealthy habit of downshifting for engine braking on my part, but that's not the question. 

So the question is... can the engine be cleaned with adegreaser like Simple Green without pulling it apart? Would spraying a mist at the fan when the engine is warm cause a problem? 100% humidity doesn't kill engines in rainy weather. Pressure wash from below?That would send the gunk up to fallback down again. Guess I'll have to doa little study on thisbyrecording oil tempsbefore and after,but thought the list may know some tricks.
