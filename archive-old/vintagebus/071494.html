Subject: Re: [VB] Compression Ratio (again)

Ok, keep in mind that I'm no expert on engines; but if it were me, I'd
probably run a compression ratio somewhere between 8 and 9 to 1.

&gt; OK. I never did get a good solid answer on the compression ratio for my
engine. This is what I have: 78 mm crank, 90.5 mm P/C, big valve heads
(40x37.5) with oval ports polished and matched to manifolds, Weber dual 42
DCNFs,Engle 110 cam, I plan to run a deck height about 0.050 - 0.060. WHAT
COMPRESSION RATIO WOULD YOU RUN WITH THIS COMBINATION? Going into a first
generation bus still running RBs.
&gt; This is my second attempt at porting and shaping intakes and my first
attempt at manifold matching, but I like what I see! You have to think like
air &gt;.
