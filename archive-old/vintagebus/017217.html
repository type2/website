Subject:  High oil temp = leak?

Thanks everyone for the help. I don't think that I'm willing to pull the 
engine over this. The temp is not that bad yet. My tins are all intact and I 
have an upright fan housing. Maybe this all is just air temp 
difference...but I drove this thing 900miles in two days back in June and 
never crossed 240F and now I sometimes push 260F.

I guess that much change is not all that much to complain about. My guage is 
correct I've checked it at 220F with a candy thermometer.
Anyway thank for the suggestions, I'll keep you all posted on if I find 
anything.

Scott
