&gt;...is supposed to flash when the e-flashers are on, yes?

IIRC this is correct.  My battery's been unhooked for awhile as
the Bus gets eine new Bremsesystem und neue Auspuff.

&gt;But on my '65 standard there's no wire coming out of the back 
&gt;(thanks, PO), and the light doesn't appear on the wiring diagram.
&gt;What's it _supposed_ to connect to?

I have the same big light on my '64 Standard and I was pondering
this the other day while looking at the wiring diagram.  I think
it should connect to the skinny solid-color wire (red, orange,
or brown) that runs only between the hazard light switch (J6) and
the emergency light relay (J1).

This wire operates the coil of the emergency light relay.  The
relay connects the two front turn-signal wires together and to
battery hot when the coil is energized.  The emergency light switch
connects this wire and the two rear stop/turn wires together and
to the output of the turn signal flasher (J).  This way, the
turn signal flasher only has to power two big bulb filaments,
the relay coil, and the dash light, instead of all four big
bulb filaments.

The dash light probably grounds through its mounting but it might 
need a separate ground wire.

This weekend I will check my Bus and let you know for sure.
