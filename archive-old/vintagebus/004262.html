 Why does this always happen to me. I have a Binz # 114 ( oldest one
documented so far) and no one wants them and thinks they are wierd, so i
sold it. Same thing happened with the 54 DOUBLE DOOR Barndoor panel I had in
1990, no one wanted barndoors so I finally traded it for a crewcab. When was
the last time you say in person a barndoor doubledoor? Even Dave Heard and
Tony ( the hat) didn't want it.
 Maybe I'm a trend setter, so you all better watch old VW Howard and what
I'm working on now as they are sure to be hotter than Kyle's shooters next
year. My moto : BUY HIGH AND SELL LOW 2 or 3 years ahead of time.
 See you all at Phoenix April 1st and Kelly Park week after.
