Subject: Re: [VB] Baywindow tank swap
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

while every one is focused on gas tanks, Does any one know if I can use the 
late bug gas gauge thats built into the speedo in my 59' bus in combination 
with a gas tank from a 67' bus? If the sender isn't compatible is there one 
that will fit the tank that is? I want to have a gas gauge thats in plain 
view, without cutting a hole in my dash.
