&gt; Hi:
&gt;     Is there any major change of frt. beam and rear axle/tranny between
&gt; 66 and 67 model year?  I am planning to upgrade the suspension of my 63 and I 
&gt; wonder which is the best choice. 
Michael,

66 and 67 front beams are identical, being the only 2 years with a factory
swaybar.  Get whichever one is in better condition.

66 tranny is the same as 64-65.  6v sized bellhousing same gearing.  67
tranny is geared a bit higher allowing lower rpms at freeway speed and has
a 12v bellhousing.  IMHO its the best year of splitty tranny, if one needs
highway speeed.

The smallnut tranny you have is cheaper to rebuild teh redux boxes on, and
you can go highway speeds with big ass rear tires... but the look of those
big tires may not work for some purists ;)

peas,

Steve
