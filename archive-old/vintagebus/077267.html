Subject: Re: [VB] Oil cooler leak  was  Re: [VB] bad day . . . bus
  broken

&gt; Noticed a little oil drip on left side.  Ya, it turns out to look a lot like 
&gt; oil cooler.

&gt; Hi DDixon,
&gt; Pull the engine this weekend and fix it!  That is the sort of leak that can 
&gt; easily get really bad all too fast.  We once picked up a low mileage Kombi 
with 
&gt; SO-33 interior that had been run dry and destroyed the engine due to such a 
&gt; leak.

Sometimes all that's needed is a good jump start. Thanks for the good advice. I 
know it doesn't take all that long.
