Subject: Bigtops vs driveaways

From: Claralw_at_aol_dot_com

&gt; But I think the drive away tents - the ones that have the bead that
&gt; slides into the rail on the bus, came later.  My bus has the brackets on
&gt; the roof and front bumper for the westy tent pole to attach to. 

From: Sean Dorman &lt;croftyest_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;

&gt; Hmm. My '65 is a SO42 and has the Big-Top tent, slider and all. Go figure.

It sure tickles me to hear these terms being used, since as far as I know
I came up with them when I was first describing them on the tent pages
(www.jsclark_dot_net/vw), what must be close to ten years ago now.  What I
call the &quot;Big Top&quot; is the free-standing floorless tent with the wide front
door (65-67) with the bead (Vortzeltkeder) that slides into a rail
(Vorzeltleiste) attached to the gutter.  What I call the &quot;Drive-Away&quot; is
the bay tent with floor that has a bead that clips directly to the gutter. 

In retrospect the &quot;Drive-Away&quot; label really applies to both tents and the
latter one is probably better referred to as the &quot;Add-a-Room&quot; which I
think was its official name anyway.  But I ain't gonna change it now since
my terminology has entered the lexicon, guaranteeing me immortality. 

The tent Clara refers to that uses the roof &amp; bumper brackets I call the
&quot;Privy&quot; tent because some versions had a little toilet room on the back
(BIB) wall.  That's me with a roll of TP mugging for the camera from the
privy of my first tent, the one that started it all, on the site.  

An even smaller tent I called the &quot;Foyer&quot; is just big enough to act as a
vestibule over the cargo doors - and must be rarest of the rare since mine
is the only one I've seen outside of brochures.  I've put brackets on the
roof of my '65, even though it's an earlier tent, and I plan to *use* the
m.f. camping in that fakewestia mod when I finish the tranny work and get
it on the road again.  I used to hang it over the hatch of my 71 westy to
make a sort of covered utility room, but that never looked like much. I've
camped with it once mounted correctly on the '65 and it's freakin'
awesome, but then some folks are easily amused.  My add-a-room tent is
getting pretty worn out now but since it will work with the splitty I'm
hanging onto it for occasional use on longer campouts.  My dream is to get
hold of a bigtop one of these days.

None of these tents are as practical as new ones but then that's not the
point.  I've got a nice 10x10 freestanding Eureka dome that I use when I
care about convenience - hey, maybe I'll make it the dedicated tent for
when I take the '65 vert on trips.

One of these days I will get off my butt and update the pages with some
pix sent by kind folks over the last year or so.  I'm procrastinating
because I really need to reorganize and redesign the whole site.

Anyhoo, just wanted to jump in and make sure everyone knew the true and
proper application of these venerable terms, lest imprecision creep into
our discussions and I have to jump on someone for referring to the poptop
canvas as a &quot;tent&quot;.  :-)
