I missed the BYOB/Red Barn show due to a grenaded generator pulley
(http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/cgi-bin/gallery-search.cgi?string=no+red+barn)
I ended up having to weld another pulley half to the remains of the blown
pulley and then use a gear puller to remove it.  Installed a new pulley
and set off again.  By the time I got on the road BYOB was already a fading
memory, so I went straight to the hotel in Morgan Hill to meet up with 
John Henry.  When he got there, we hung out a bit, I let him check out my
bus - me made quite an impression on it - and then we decided to rip
it around for lack of anything better to do.  So we wandered around the
hills, demonstrating my bus's climbing abilities, and then headed south
just to drive.  We came across one VW junkyard/shop (pix will be on my
page) and another generic junkyard.  While scouting the generic junkyard
(which had some late-model VW's) from the elevated railroad tracks, we
were concerned about hearing a train wail, but no train.  It turned out to
be a semi tractor driving by that saw us out there, and was having a bit
of fun.

The VW Dinner that night was fun, lotsa new faces and good grub.  I'll
let someone else detail the awards and celebrities as I'm not really
familiar with all the aftermarket people. 

KP was a blast.  We showed up _at_ 6:15, only to be redirected to the back
of the 1.5 mile line.  That's where I met up with Ronnie, et al and
we hung out for a while until it was time to enter.  For all of the 
hand-wringing about the show, it went very smoothly - more so than in 
the past, IMHO.  One thing that wasn't obvious at first was where the 
swap was; nobody mentioned it was in the lower lot!   So, I got the bus 
and tent set up, and then wandered around looking for stuff to buy.  There 
was lots of stuff, but nothing immediately applicable to any of my projects except
a set of rebuilt semaphores with NOS lenses.   I also had the honor of
giving John Henry a ride to the show, and even let him play with the 
siren.

The 11:00 RAMVA meeting went off without a hitch, got to put even more
faces to names.  Met quite a few listees; Tom Good even made it out from Vermont,
although his borrowed bus broke.  Clara and Sam were there, along with
the Brothers Barnes, whom I had the honor of parking next to, with Steve
on the other side.  There were others whose names escape me as I fight to
stay awake..

I bailed out around 3:00 or so, had a leisurely trip and got home ~6:30
with a nice tailwind from Cordelia to Sacramento.
