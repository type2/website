Hi John,
Hopefully it is just the flywheel seal on the front of the engine.  When you 
have the engine out, but before removing the FW check your endplay for too 
much slop.  When you have the FW off make sure to clean the oil off the left 
side of the case and look for a crack near #3 cylinder!  If cracked you need 
to rebuild the engine.    Eric&amp;Barb
