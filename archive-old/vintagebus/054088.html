Subject: New motor running, but badly, oil blowby question

My new motor blew some oil out exhaust port 3 when hand turning, and seems
to blow by some on abandoned run to break her last night. I had to stop in
fear of the rich carb (being replaced, as it's unadjustable, needs another
rebuild, besides the gas leak), but is this normal, to have some oil go
through until the rings are happy? Or is this motor crap to being with?
