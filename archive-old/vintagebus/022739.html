It's kinda strange.  When *I'm* looking for something, it's super expensive
and &quot;HTF&quot; - but when I'm *selling* something it's common.

I was trying to find a set of panel cargo doors when I got the panel.  A
few people had them, and wanted Big Bucks.  The panel came with the low
hinge doors, which I can't use, which are suddenly now as common as super
beetle talights.

I guess I should put a set of NOS ribbed bumpers up for sale, so that 10
other sets will come out of the woodwork for $50 each, then I can go buy
them all...
