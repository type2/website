Hi guys,
I visited my bus in the resto shop (Wilson's Auto Restoration, Owings, MD) a
couple days ago and the fella wanted to know what the information was for my
paint.  I told him that there was an exact match in the Glasurit 21 line and
that the colors were L311 and L312. He said that he needs a paint chip for
each so that he can match it with the computer.  Is there any source for such
a thing?  I am thinking I should just make him shoot the Glasurit, but I want
the paint to come out good.  I don't want to give him the excuse that he was
not used to the type of paint.  But I also don't want to have my bus next to
another bus in the same colors only to see that it is WAY off.  Other than
that, progress is looking very good.
Dan Morris
