I will sell one of my buses to whoever's willing to pay the price, who cares
what country their from, I always get paid in dollars. If I got prejudice as
to who I would sell to I would never probably sell a bus, when I do sell
it's because I need the money, somebody needs one of my buses more then me,
or I have found something I like better. I don't have unlimited funds to buy
and keep everything I find, but I have had the opportunity to own and drive
a wide assortment of different buses and so far my DD camper (almost) seems
to be my favorite. When my side loader single cab arrives, who knows it
could become my favorite, but I'll still keep the DD unless I find another I
like better. Now I'm going to restore my 59 single, just to see if I can
build a trailer queen commercial, then it Will be for sale, maybe go to
Japan, England or back east or who knows maybe next store

ronnie &quot;keep it/sell it, pro choice&quot;

I don't really share this attitude. They are an imported car, after all. Saw
the same sentiment expressed about Uncle Jerry's hearse. He just imported it
from Germany a couple of years back! Many of the cool odd buses have been
imported fairly recently. If the Europeans felt the same way, there wouldn't
be any highroofs, laddertrucks, ambulances, right hand drives, Mannlifts,
'50 panels, or firetrucks here to look at. The buses can go where the most
willing buyer is and that is fair. They will sell them back when someone
here is more willing. Just saying no to a high selling price because it's
for overseas won't solve any problem, real or imagined. The next guy will
sell and the loss of one more bus will still happen. Better we spend our
energy trying to prevent the destruction of buses by 'friendly fire',
whether intentional or not. You could actually save buses that way. An
overseas buyer that spent a bundle isn't going to 'bathtub' a barndoor
deluxe, hack the engine louvers out, weld up the gates on a singlecab,
stretch a Westy and put a V8 in it, make a crewcab out of a Kombi, weld one
to the roof of a schoolbus, or just let them sit in a field and rot away to
nothing. The buses going overseas are protected, whether in the States or
not, the ones here are in the most danger.

&gt; Glad to hear that, hope that alot of people follow this trend and say no
to
&gt; selling overseaes.
