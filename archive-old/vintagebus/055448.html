Subject: Re: [VB] Automatic Choke Question

&gt; After I got the timing right (stock vacuum distributor) 

Make sure that it is the right dizzy and timed like this, thanks to Jim T.
at www.oldvolkshome_dot_com :

Distributor: VW 131-905-205, Bosch 0231 137 011 &gt; 315-905-205B, 0231 137 031
Can Use: VW 113-905-205K/L, Bosch 0231 137 009/010, 113-905-205M, 0231 137
021, 113-905-205T, 0231 137 035 or 036

Timing Set At:: 7.5deg BTDC Static or _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe and vacuum hose
disconnected and plugged
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum (Advance Only): 17-19deg _at_ 1.3 In. Hg, 24-28deg
_at_ 3.2 In. Hg 

&gt;So I pulled the carb last night and rebuilt it 

I agree with Matt that it needs a good nuclear waste swim for a day.  Then
blown out with an air compressor.

&gt;Drove it around just fine. Parked, reconnected the automatic choke and
within a minute it died at idle. 

Hmmm...  Could be a bad wire from the coil to the choke and electromagnetic
solenoid.  Check the Ohms on these wires and see what you get.  Also if you
have an electronic ignition of some kind only two wires should be on the
coil, one positive and one negative, no choke wires.

Also check that the carb is tuned right, the volume control screw can be a
real pain if not properly adjusted.

I always work backwards.  Over rich and over advanced on initial dialing in
and then tune it back from there until everything sounds good...  Of course
do not drive around with it this way just for initial tuning for it to warm
up fully.

As a side note on my engine.  It will not idle on its own once the choke
kicks off and the motor is not 100% warm at 180F.  Have to help it with a
little throttle at lights.  I think I can fix this once the oil bath is
hooked back up because the motor needs warm air to inhale until fully warm.

Hopefully this ramble will help :)

Good Luck,
