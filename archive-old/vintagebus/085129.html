Subject: Dave Brooks, Fuel shutoff valve

Dear Dave!
yes, I use a Swiss made shut-off valve.

Firstly, to prevent typical VW Bus engine fires ( my fuel lines ruptured once!
)
and secondly, to prevent the oh-so-common car jacking! ( I got both the Toyota
Van and the Ford SW back, because the car jackers ran out of petrol and could
not get it started again! )

I usually remove the valve, before I sell or change the car it's in and keep
it for fitment into the replacement vehicle.

Description:
Its body is chromed / galvanized, lenght approx. 1 inch and a half, about 1
inch thick and has a + and - cable go inside and has ribbed ends on either
side where you connect it into your fuel line with flexible, clear pieces of
plastic (?) tubing.

My Dad got it for me from the Migros Corporation's DIY Centre, and it is
manufactured by &quot;hacki&quot; &quot;pat.pend.&quot; Migros is a big chainstore in Switzerland
and Germany.

If you tell me how to publish a picture for you, I will gladly do so.

Have a great new year!
