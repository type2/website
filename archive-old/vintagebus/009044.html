If you have Speedvision on your TV system there are several specialty
insurance companies that advertise on their restoration, classic car, hot
rod, etc. programs.

Also check Hemmings Motor News for ads.

There are several companies in this niche market, and their terms,
conditions, and rates appear to vary widely.  Shop around 'til you find an
outfit that seems to be a good fit for your needs.  Remember that they're
not in business to turn away potential clients, and don't be afraid to
negotiate.

&gt;&gt;  I was just quoted a declared value policy by Hagerty Insurance. The car
in question is used primarily for shows,  occasional pleasure driving, and
garaged. I was quoted $187.00 annually without a mileage restriction.  &lt;&lt;
