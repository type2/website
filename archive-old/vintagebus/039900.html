&gt;That looks like Dana Nye's bus....not sure though.  His bus is NICE, but 
&gt;not worth that.  Just my opinion though.
&gt;
&gt;S.
&gt;_______________________________________________________________________

All I can muster, is that the house I just purchased cost the same as that 
bus.

Only hope that the bus would be as theft proof as my house connected to its 
foundation.

If someone wants a bus a little cheper my panel is availabe at a reduced 
rate discount of $30,000.00 for the first buyer to call today,

just call    (813) woa-nely
