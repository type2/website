5) 5:30 PM arrived at VTO BlackStar Campout.
6) 6:30, VTO FEED, great fish, carne asada, tacos, rice, beans,etc that I have
ever had.
7) 10:00, 1st out on poker game. I was the winner as I was asleep by 10:30 PM.
Game ended around 1 AM.
8) 5 AM up for OCTO busavan. Wet, rainy and real crappy for us with no wipers.
