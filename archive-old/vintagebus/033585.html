    I just got a call from Rich at OE VW in Colorado, his store is 10 miles
from 11 mile camp, you'll pass it going to the camp ground. He has just
informed me that the camp ground across the street from his place has 18
spots still avaiable for camping. There is hot showers and they also have a
huge building available  in case of a storm, not uncommon this time of year.
So if any body hasn't made reservations for camping or need a place p-mail
me and I will forward the info.

ronnie,  it'll put you a lot closer to RMMW
