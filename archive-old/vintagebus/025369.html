Greetings fellow bussers,

I'm still collecting tools, parts, and camping gear. It's not really
possible to plan for EVERY situation that might come up, either because
I couldn't afford to go out and get all that stuff at one time, and
because I probably couldn't dream up enough situations that I should be
prepared for.

I've blown up more than my share of engines, and had to change them in
unusual places. One night in a friend's bus (t4), the cooling fan spun
loose from the crank, it was late, cold and windy, so we camped on the
side of the interstate. It was nice to have the propane heater handy!
Fixed it temporarily the next morning, got home and then fixed it
properly.

One of the more unusual tools I carry is a MAPP/Oxy welding setup that I
bought from WalMart for about 25 bucks. It's cheap, doesn't take up much
space, and has come in handy a couple of times. I fixed my sister's
speedo cable with it the other day (yeah, a new one is cheap, but I
wasn't doing anything, and I will get her a new one from work if the old
one breaks again). I could have used it to fix a broken flange on an oil
cooler (another engine pull in an unusual place), but forgot that I had
it, and came up with a different solution.

I also carry a 4&quot; side grinder and a small suction-cup base vise, which
will stick to the top of my toolbox. These have come in handy a couple
of times, too. If you need to shape a homemade part on the side of the
road where there is no electrical power, and your engine is running ok,
you can bolt a 4x4&quot; piece of sandpaper onto your generator pulley and
Voila! You have a bench grinder! (been there, done that)

You could have all the tools, spare parts, camping equipment, spare
fuel, food, cell phone, AAA card, etc. with you, but your most valuable
asset will be a cool head. If you don't let your situation panic you,
you can usually figure out a way to get past it, and you will have
another story to add to your collection of bus adventures...  Now if I
can only figure out how to apply that to my everyday life!
