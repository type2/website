&gt; Rob &amp; Justin Laffoon as well as myself are heading to Kansas City Friday
&gt; June 1st in the evening.  We, as well as Dan Kinsey from Florida (KCMO
&gt; native), will be attending the MoKan show on Saturday.  I know it's gonna be
&gt; hard to pull myself from the show but around noon or so we will have to head
&gt; out towards Topeka, KS and meet up with Rick Taylor in order to make our
&gt; first stop/campout in Kanopolis, KS.
&gt; 
&gt; Sunday we hope to plod down highway 56 toward Dodge City, KS and then jog
&gt; south of there towards highway 54.  Eventually Tucumcari, NM will come into
&gt; view letting us know Albuquerque, NM is over the horizon.  Lake Havasu City
&gt; and the boys beckon us so I40 will be our yellow brick road to there.  We've
&gt; been promised the red carpet treatment - they know how to lure you back
&gt; there. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Oceanside, CA is where our host Don Boneau resides and we hope to make it
&gt; there sometime Thursday if luck is with it but we'll see what happens.
