I am currently looking for a bus. I am looking for a passenger bus or a cargo
bus.  I live in Saginaw, MI.  I have a couple of leads on buses for sale and
was wondering how much of the garage it will take up.  I would like to know
height, width, and length.  Any help would be appreciated.  Also, I you know
of any buses FS let me know.  

Thanks,
Steve
