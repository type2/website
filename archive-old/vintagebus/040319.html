Remove the rusty rocker and have a look
in the cavity between the floor and the
belly pan.

I'd expect that if the outer rocker is
gone the inner will also be thin/toast
and when both are removed you can look in.
Check the rear of the front wheel wells
where the jackpoint/outrigger/inner rocker
connect....any holes or is it soft?

So remove the rusty metal you have now
and take a look! In my experience you'd be *unbelievably*
lucky to get away with an inner/outer rocker
replacement, and still *really* lucky if 
the front outriggers and jack points were all
that had to be added to the list...

And if the bus is a 'keeper' do every bit that's
soft or thin.  I can't imamgine anything worse than having
to revisit it in 2 to 5 years to get the bits that weren't
done the first time!

------------------------------------------
Is there any way to check for rust under the cargo
floor? Is that area sealed from the seat mounts? There
is a (belly pan?) under that whole compartment, so I
can't look from underneath. There are no holes down
there, but the driver's side rocker needs replacing,
and the lip in the floor near the cargo door latch is
crusting away.
