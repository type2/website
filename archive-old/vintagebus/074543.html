Subject: Re: church key

Someone asked why this thing is called a &quot;church key&quot;.  That's just slang for any big key, like the large keys used to unlock those huge ornate doors 
on old churches.

The kind of bottle opener that has a loop on the end (looks a lot like a bus church key) is also commonly referred to as a church key -- and by 
extension, any bottle opener.  Probably originally from the resemblance to the large keys and reinforced by the irony of drinking vs. church, as in 
&quot;Well, it's nearly noon on Sunday.  Time to open up the church.&quot;  Or perhaps real church keys are handy for opening bottles.

I suspect the etymology went something like &quot;real church key&quot; --&gt; &quot;bottle opener that looks like a church key&quot; --&gt; &quot;bus engine lid / gas flap tool that 
resembles a bottle opener that looks like a church key&quot;
