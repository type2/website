&gt; The best battery you can buy is an Optima. They're a little hard to

batteries is

consider mine

From what I understand these are great batteries.  The fact that they
are sealed (I think) is another plus.

I didn't mention them because, as you mentioned, they are pretty hard
to find.

Also, the price is pretty steep.  You mentioned $100, which is down
from the $120 I remember seeing a few months ago.  At $100, they would
have to be last 15 years to provide the same bang for the buck than
the current conventional batteries from Pep Boys.

If you're a cost-is-no-object person, the Optima is probably the way
to go, but I'm waiting for the price to drop some more before I get one.
