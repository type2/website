I will assume you got both of the grub bolts out of the shift coupler? That
being the case, it may be rusted. Normally our beloved buses drool and
slobbra enough gear oil out the nose cone to keep this area well protected.
This is not the case with yours? Nice and dry? May I have your nose cone
please? I would expect that you could cut the coupler off, but it sounds
like a dandy one. Other folks are all the time having the setscrews fall out
and the coupler break and all manner of other things, yours don't want to
come apart for nothing. What it don't take to make some people happy. Have
you tried grabbing the hockey stick and twisting it to work the coupler
loose? I don't mean with a cheater bar, just a firm grip. A little heat
might do the trick, especially if there is some sort of glue in there. I
would heat the end on the front and try to get it off there so as you can
work on the other side out from under the bus should you decide further
disassembly is necessary and so you can replace the shift rod bushing while
you are there. If it don't wanna come off, I guess you could put it back
together in utero. Reminds me of the joke about the gynecologist that
decided to become a mechanic. She got an A on the engine rebuilding course
even though it took her 3 weeks longer than everyone else because she did it
all through the exhaust manifold. 8^O

Good luck,

&gt; The connector from the shift rod to the gear selector lever (hockey stick)
&gt; seems to have fused to the &quot;hockey stick&quot;.
