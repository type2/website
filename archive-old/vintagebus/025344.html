Hello List,

I too am interested in carrying extra fuel. I like to carry the whole
array of tools with me (large toolbox, extra parts, floor jack, stands,
mini-compressor, cheater bar, big piece of cardboard to lie on, etc) and
have a nifty heavy duty plastic 5 gallon gas can I would like to carry
on my butt-ugly (but sturdy) homemade roof rack. Maybe all this seems
like overkill to some of you, but I've had to pull blown engines a
couple of times in odd places (once at a truckstop, once in a motel
parking lot), and besides, you never know when you might run across a
damsel in distress...

At any rate, how safe is it to carry a full gas can on top of my bus?
