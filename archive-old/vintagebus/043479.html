&gt;I am curious. It sounds like if you have the wires you can find the rear
&gt;terminus if you remove the left hinge cover. Where can the wires be
&gt;accessed from the front of the bus?

I'm not sure, but they would have run down to the dash area to connect
to the radio.  Look in the corners where the &quot;A&quot; pillars (metal piece
between windshield and front edge of front door) end, above the parcel
shelf, and you should find them somewhere. IIRC the dome light wires
run up the left A-pillar.

&gt;If it is a pair would it be possible to use for left channel hot and 
&gt;one for right channel hot and the ground each channels minus to the
&gt;body?

This depends on your radio/amp.  Some older, lower powered radios
had exactly the setup you describe: one hot for each speaker with
the other side of each speaker connected to the body.  Some radios
have three wires for each pair of speakers: left hot, right hot,
and return for both speakers...you CANNOT ground the return wire
to the body!  And some radios have two wires per speaker that
can also not be grounded.  Usually there will be dire warnings in
the radio manual about this.

The wires are only about 18 gauge (0.5 mm^2), so don't try to 
drive a dual subwoofer box with them.  :)
