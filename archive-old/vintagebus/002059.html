I am trying to remove the four bolt cover holding the oil seal on the stub
axle end of the reduction boxes. I want to replace the brake backing plates.
In the 63-67 Bentley, section H-4, page 1.... it says 3 - Remove cover
retaining screws and take off cover and oil seal.
Yeah, right! All it does is rotate. I got it to move away from the backing
plate about 1mm, just enough for the gasket to disintegrate and fall out in
pieces.
Do I need a puller for this??
Any ideas why it is hanging up?
