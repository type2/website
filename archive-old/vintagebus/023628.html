Hi Mark,
We had the same happen to us and have had the brass tube pull out of the carb 
on occasion when changing the flexable fuel line (Use German cloth covered 
type of fuel line only!) every two years.  Take a hammer and center punch and 
punch four to six marks in the pot metal of the carb and fuel pump around 
these tubes to tighten up the holes on these tubes. 
  Either make sure your German grommet is still in place around the metal 
fuel line where it goes through the forward engine tin.  If the grommet is 
missing or cut through protect this metal line from sawing itself through on 
the sheet metal edge by sliding about a 2&quot; long piece of German fuel line 
that you have slit lengthwise and with the slit upwards hose clamp it into 
place!
  Make sure to still carry a fire extingisher.  Get at least a five Lbs. not 
the tiny one Lb. size and if you get the dry chemical type make sure to turn 
the bottle upside down at least once a month to keep the extingisher powder 
from caking up inside and becoming usless!
    Having tires that are rated for at least 1525 Lbs. and stiffer shocks 
like KYBs are a must to help keep side winds from pushing you from lane to 
lane suddenly.  
  MOST OF ALL make sure your brakes, steering and bearings that keep the 
wheels rolling are all in good shape, greased/oiled and maintained properly!  
Too many volks seem to think the engine comes first before all these other 
parts of thier VW in importance.  Eric&amp;Barb
