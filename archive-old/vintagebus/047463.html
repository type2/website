Subject: Timing and overheating question...

Greetings List!
I am having problems with overheating. VDO gauge reading 200+ F at 60 MPH 
w/stock tranny.I have a newly rebuilt 1500 SP with an 009 carb. I just set 
the valves and points as per the Idiot book, and checked the timing which was 
set up by the local guru when he also replaced my carb with a rebuilt PICT31. 
MY strobe light reads 10 deg. BTDC at idle and 32-34 deg BTDC at 3000 rpm. Is 
this what is causing the heating problem? I do o.k. (160 deg.) for about 10 
miles or so, then the needle on the temp gauge slowly creeps towards 200 
where it seems to want to stay. My green idiot light also flashes sometimes 
at idle after running long distances. I want to take a 200 + mile trip this 
weekend with her to the Bayfront Blues Festival in Duluth. But with these 
temps, I don't know if she can be trusted... Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Garrett
