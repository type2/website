Subject: Re: [VB] possible engine cooling ?

Hi Bob,
BTDT!  When we did this by blocking the tubes off, the engine ran about 30F 
higher oil temp during the summer.  The stock heater boxes for type 1-3 have 
a double flapper valve up front.  When the heat is turned off to the interior 
of the VW, the heater is vented out of that clamshell on the back of the head 
of the box!  Thus cooling the heater and in turn cooling the exhaust gases in 
these preventing back pressure that would cause more heat getting from the 
exhaust gases to the heads and to the engine.  Eric&amp;Barb
