Subject: The End of my Overheating (I hope) 
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

From what I have learned from peeps on the list about my heating problems is 
that the spring for my oil pressure relief valve is dead.  The plunger is 
actually the wrong style, and the end play was off.  So i took the liberty 
anyway of tearing down the top end and inspecting. Inspected all that I could 
without splitting the case.  Replaced all the seals, checked the deck height, 
and basically cleaned everything up.  

So as explained to me the plunger was opening during initial warm up as usual 
but after the oil had thinned, the spring did not have the proper spring to 
bring it back up.  In turn this restricted the flow to the cooler and caused 
the heat.  The end play was, i believe, just due to either the fact that 
number 1 main was not getting the oil flow and cooling it needed or just 
needed to be reset.  I replaced the sping and plunger and im feelng like 
going for a cruise.

Everett dropped by to bring me an engine stand from VWFOOL_at_aol_dot_com and I 
showed him the endplay.  Just by feel I thought that it was off about .004 
and as it turns out it was off by .003!  Woo Hoo!  

So now its back on the road thanks again to the ever so wise listee gurus :)
