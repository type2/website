Subject: clutch cable broke?...NOT

I thought I had a busted the clutch cable yesterday but
it turned out to be fine. That's because I actually had an extra
with me. The pedal went to the floor without the
normal resistance but still would spring back up but with no clutch action.
I got a crash course in clutchless driving as I
held up traffic a little when I couldn't get it into first at a stop sign.
I'm guessing the fork deal
that holds the throw out bearing is busted somehow.
I have not pulled the engine yet
to take a look at it.
What is involved with this repair?
Does this part have to pressed in?
Any advice is appreciated.
