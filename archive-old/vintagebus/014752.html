Subject: Going thru Nevada to BBB
To: &quot;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com Vintagebus&quot; &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Anybody traveling through Northern Nevada on the way
to BBBIV Friday afternoon the 21st and would like to
hook up for a caravan....

My wife and I are planning to leave Reno about 4ish
Friday afternoon on the way to Vegas for a stay
(couple hours of sleep) at a friends house, then the
last couple of hours Saturday morn to BBBIV in Havasu.
We will be taking our 67 Sundial Camper.

If you find yourself traveling through the area any
other time, I do have plenty of room for a stop over
for rest or any mechanics that you might need.
