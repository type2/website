Subject: [Friday] Open invitation! Bus-Life List

Greetings, type2 and Vintagebus.

We're beginning an open discussion on the Bus-Life list for anyone that's
interested.

Talk about anything you want.

I'm expanding the super-lax rules to extra-lax for the next couple of weeks.

If you don't know what we are, come give us a look.  All busses, all the
time.  No tech talk.  We are the all-Friday list.

Except for the next few weeks even less topical.  If that's even possible!

Join us NOW.  You won't regret it.
