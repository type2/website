I heard that the painting in the headlight buckets happned inother buse stooo... kind of neat.
 
I've seen buses w/o ground to the headlight wires... they ground to the body.  I think it was a year thing, but I'm not sure.

&gt;So I go inside the ['58 SC] and only find the lite wires,NO Ground wires 
&gt;in there at all.,I find that to be real confusing, so I go back out to 
&gt;the headlites and pull on the ground wires and they come out of the 
&gt;factory housing ,still looped together. They had never been hooked up at 
&gt;all. I think I just got punked by some factory worker from 1958 LOL . 
 
I wonder how the headlights were working at all in the first place. Did 
it have the short brown wire from the parking light bulb to the headlamp 
ground terminal? That might explain it; on my '64 the parking light 
bulbs have that short brown wire, but the parking light socket is also 
designed to ground the bulb to the metal headlamp shell. That would 
provide enough of a ground for the headlights to work, at least until 
you hit a real good bump or something. 
 
&gt;One neat thing I did find inside the headlite housing was somebody had 
&gt;wrote Blau with their fingers in the factory paint. 
 
Maybe they figured that some dealer mechanic would have to diagnose the 
headlights before delivery and would get to admire their finger-paint 
skillz. :)
