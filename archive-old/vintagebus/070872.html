Subject: Re: [VB] undercoating ?

;)  - I just think that if you get too many coats of stuff on under there
and if you miss a spot of rust it could rust out a big area before you even
know.  Like, if you get a scratch through all that stuff - or - if you were
sandblasting and missed some rust in a seam then the rust will be hidden but
the under coating and stuff.

My 60 was undercoated probably by the dealer in 1960.  It preserved it like
you wouldn't believe ... but there were a few spots where rust got under the
undercoating and from underneath it looked ok ... but it left a hole in the
floor noticeable from the inside.

I would think that epoxy prime, prime, paint and annual bar and chain oil
would be perfect.  I have the bottom of my 60 por-15'd and it looks really
good - but - I'll still do the bar and chain oil or ... Rust Check to get
that stuff into and scratches or chips or missed spots and I don't drive in
the winter.

Here in Eastern Canada where the use a lot of salt in the winter it is
really harmful for vehicles ... but ... every once in a while you'll see an
old car from the 70's with a bunch of those Rust Check stickers in the back
window - they always look really good and I suspect that they are driven all
year long.
