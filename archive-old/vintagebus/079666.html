Subject: odd (not ballsy) rattle

Recently my bus has started an odd (and somewhat irritating) sound.
It's kinda a rattle. I thought it sounded like a valve trane sound,
but set my valves this morning and all was well. I started the enigine
and listened with my stethascope. The sound was definately coming from
the exhaust. I'd put it on the engine and nothing but purrrrrrrr. It
really sounds like something is rattling around in the exhaust. anyone
seen this? I have done no engine work recently to have something fall
in. I guess the best way to describe the sound is &quot;tink,tink,tink&quot;

I could not find any loose tin or the like.
