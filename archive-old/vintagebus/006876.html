my 60 DD and 61 side loader do not have e flashers, my 62 panel had e
flashers, but just had the black knob with no markings, my 63 double cab had
a red knob that didn't light up, my 64 combi has the red knob and the dash
light, my old 65 westy had a red knob that lite up and no dash light.

hi e&amp;b,

I have a late 61 mangobus with no e flasher (it was made maybe spring of 
61, which would be halfway through the model year..)

My friend has an even later 61 deluxe made toward the end of production,
and it has an e-flasher... (i'd guess his was made summer 61..)

No idea if its factory installed or not... he has a gas gague too...

take care,

Steve
