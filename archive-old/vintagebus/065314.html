Subject: Re: [VB] How would you write your bus ad?

Trade only!

1963 EZ Camper, Mint Green, 3/4 Rack, Great 1600cc engine, OG Tranny stuck in
2nd, spare UFO big nutter tranny to go with bus. Great overall condition. Good
opportunity to chase it all over the road, Must throw anchor out window to
stop. Divorce forces sale, Third kid expected in exactly 9 months. Will trade
for new unregistered Kimber 1911 style .45, Belgian 12 ga. pump shotgun, fast
getaway vehicle and hidden cabin in the woods. Ruby Ridge area or anywhere in
Humbolt Cty. considered. Today only or contact me on my cell phone,
(602)RAN-AWAY

STOP!
I'm kidding... I have sold vehicles every time that my dear, sweet, lovely wife
and I have had children. I *know* that she and I will not be having a third. If
she comes up PG again then there will be a show down that will hit the front
page of the local press. Until then (hopefully) the bus is staying put.
We are blessed with a great healthy family at a great size and wish for NO MORE
CHANGES!!! No more kids, no more dogs or additional cats. Likewise, I am lucky
to have a really straight, no frills thumper camper that needs some work but
will be great once it hits the highway. No intentions of selling it, making it
into a magazine slut or buying others. My hands are full and my pockets are
empty.

Merry Christmas, Happy George Castanza Day, &quot;Fritzel?&quot;(12/23) and Joyous
Kwanza!
