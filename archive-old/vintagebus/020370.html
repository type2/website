Subject: [VB] &quot;Bussing&quot; Man Event


If we want to have our own &quot;Bussingman&quot; event in the desert a great place to
camp where the temp gets above 120, is the Saline Valley in California (part
of Death Valley National Monument), we could all drive down to the springs.
We would just need to make sure we planned accordingly with regards to food
water gas and all. It's about 70 miles from the closest town of lone pine.
If anyone wants to do something like this let me know and I will help plan
it. Though I must admit that I would choose October over August.
Shawn
