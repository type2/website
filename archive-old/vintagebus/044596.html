another thing- was the transplant a straight swap of transaxle out, other in?
Or were you removing the axle tubes and shafts and switching things around?
I wasted a certain amount of time with my bus due to the flucrum plates
slipping after i had the axle shaft in where I was putting the axle tube in it
seemed like the shaft was sticking out too far- took the shaft off, un-
wodgered the fulcrum plates, put it back together and the bus was on its way
to grooviness.
