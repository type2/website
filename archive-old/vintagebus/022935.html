Honestly...I think it looks better in primer with the UK number plate.
Actually, is it an RHD?  I saw the outside mirror was opposite where I'd
expect it to be.  Frankly, my 2 cents on the subject, if you've got the
original paint and it's a little faded or there original logos on it and
there's no immediate rust danger, then leave it.  They look awesome that way.

But if there's rust trouble and it's gotta be fixed, don't sweat it. I'd
rather see a bus saved than rot away because it's got OG paint.
