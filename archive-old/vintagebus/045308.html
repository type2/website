&lt;&lt; It appears that one of my head studs is pulling out of the case. I went to
 do a valve adjustment, and noticed the nut was loose. I got out my torque
 wrench and attempted to torque it to 22 ft-lbs, but it wouldn't get
 there....  &gt;&gt;
Hi Aaron,
Yes, there are larger case savers you can use, but most likely doing this 
will only extend the engine just a little longer before pulling out of a over 
heated softened case.  So in other words if you must, go ahead, and install a 
bigger case saver, and then start building a new engine.  If the old engine 
stays together great, if not, then you have a new engine hopefully complete 
to go in or at least partially assembled.    Eric&amp;Barb
