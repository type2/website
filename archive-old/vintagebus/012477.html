On a steamy wet west Texas road our hero had found the seventy mile an
hour top speed and was maintaining it when the bus said hello buy
quilting dead. Just then a car passed him, probably the last one he'd see
all day. So he pulled over on the wide shoulder and piled out of the van.
He then went around to the business end of the thing and popped the rear
hatch reattached the coil wire and clambered back in the front and fired
it up. 
The van went whistling and putting and flapping through LBJ land to the
mythical home
of the pop top repairman  listed in the back of the idiot book.  However,
he was told by
the citizens of that metropolis said artisan had retired. It was
fortuitous he was there
because there was something even better; Austin VeeDub. Just this side of
heaven there is a humongous VW junkyard it's name is Austin VeeDub.(free
plug)
 His fuel cut off solenoid has long sense said &quot;I quit&quot;, (so he did a
road side bang-it-with-a-rock-till-it-won't-close repair) and now he was
able to fix it right with a screw-in &quot;manual&quot; jet.
At AVD he purchased his spare parts for the road along with the jet and
split town. The
bus was much happier except for the dent to the rear bumper from a low
laying cement
pole in a Dairy Queen parking lot.
Many miles latter the Bus voiced it's objection to being stuck in a
Houston traffic jam.
It stalled. Then it wouldn't start. Our hero got it to the shoulder OK
but the Bus refused to
start and protested further by having a electrical fire, smoke was
pouring out the air
scoops like Hollywood special effects! He scrambled to the back and
yanked in the battery cable as hard as he could. The fire stopped. After
everything cooled off he hot wired it and left Texas.
Our Hero now carries a fire extinguisher in his Kombie.
