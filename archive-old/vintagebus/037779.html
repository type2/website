&gt;I hadn't made a local copy of the distribution, so I couldn't email y'all what was going on - sorry.

Luckily you've done that now and will remember to update the list status page so I can just check http://www2.ari_dot_net/dworkin/status.txt for details.

Losing the VintageBus list is comparable to kicking a Heroin habit.  And the Type 3 list a'int no Methodone, I assure you.
