Subject: e-bay????vintage bus list????
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

You know, if I wanted to know all there was to know about e-bay, I would go 
there and study it.  I didn't.  I thought.  I thought I joined a mailing list 
about vintage VW buses.  But lately, the mail on this list concerning e-bay 
way outnumbers the mail about vintage buses.  This conversation has come up 
before and it has been suggested that whoever doesn't want to hear about 
e-bay crap can just hit the delete key.  Anymore, it would seem to be more 
practical to &quot;select all&quot; and delete.
