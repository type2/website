Subject: Re: [VB] Bay window tank into splitty

The 68-71 sender works with the 6v gauge, no problem at all. Still zero ohms
one way and 90 ohms the other. Only difference is the length.
Fuel senders work with 6 to 24 volts.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Okay, I scored a very clean bay window gas tank at Sacto BOR, to put in my 64
bus, and have seen the website that shows the filler neck mods to put it in,
but as far as the gas gauge goes, do any of you know if the bay window sender
will work with a splitty gauge?  I know the 6v splitty fuel stuff works with
12v just fine, but are the ohm's just way out of range on the 'newer' sender
to work with the older gauge?

I was going to check with my ohmmeter when I got the tanks out, but thought
maybe I could save some time if someone here knows for sure or not.

Thanks for any help!
