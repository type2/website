Vintage price lists for just about anything....
Some that I loked at over the past year seem to be pretty close to what
the market is paying...be sure and check out the price for a cherry 1967
21 window deluxe.  $$$$$$$$$$ &gt;&gt;

Anybody out there know how to work the 1967 vs. 2001 dollars? Just as 
a point of reference to make a bit more sense out of the prices. 
Also, approx. how many '67 21 window deluxe's were there, even in '67?
Rarity affects price...I know of the sale of an &quot;unrestorable&quot; British pick
up truck, that was purchased for the original title. It was the &quot;yard truck&quot;
for the factory that occasionally went on the road...A factory &quot;one-off&quot;
and hence, valuable...
