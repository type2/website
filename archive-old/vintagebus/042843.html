Traveling Trampoliner's;

  Shift Rod Removal: I tried a few methods, first a few days soaking with
pb blaster, then the torch, then a refrigerator tie down (connected to the
the back shift rod coupler and another VW van parked perpendicular or any
stationary object)  Caution: Make sure the bus is secure on the jack
stands, cause your going to rachet till your afraid the bus will be pulled
off the jack stands.  [You'll know this cause the tie-down is like a well
tightened guitar string and you'll hear a scary sound of the rust slightly
breaking free)  Remove the fridge tie-down.  Then one small well placed
hammer to marlin spike blow will set it free.  Joyfully, pull the rod out,
then blow it out, then stick a sock soaked in grease remover with a long
rod like your shift rod (probably just rust dust in there anyhow)  Order
your 2 badmitten and front bushing, and 2 rubber bellows ahead of time
Follow with a sock soaked in Marine Clean, rinse, dry, then soak soaked in
POR-15 [paint the rod while your at it] Don't worry about it again for
your life!

  Propane: It almost killed me in my sleep, it sticks to your hemoglobin
like carbon monoxide, I felt like I ran a marathon just walking 50 feet
for 3 weeks.. Odorless for many years while people put there heads in
ovens and committed suicide, They finally put mercapitan in it so you can
smell the skunk odor before and wretch outside the oven first -&gt; but if
your sleeping that don't mean nothing.  Think twice; it is not alright!

Best,
