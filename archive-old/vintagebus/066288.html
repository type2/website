Subject: Re: [VB] OT: Verizon Phone Service for Bus Traveling

What is a cell phone and why do I NEED one?

I follow the Easy Rider standpoint (pre commercialization, someone should be 
shot for that... Apparently people forget what the movie stands for!) when I 
drive my bus... No clock... No phone... Just me and the road.

If I breakdown. I walk.

If I need to make a call there are still like a gazillion pay phones around 
which for my limited use is a way better deal than any $30, $40, or $50 a 
month.

Plus it is unsafe to drive and talk anyway... More dangerous statisically 
total numbers wise than drunk driving!  I have a phone at home and at work, 
why do I need to talk in between?

Then again if you think another bill is freedom from the corporate machine 
then go ahead and sign up...  Then wonder where all your money went.  Then 
get a home equity loan and squander your best asset.

To keep it real some people NEED them for thier work... For normal folks it 
is a complete waste of money...  Then again I cannot explain the SUV craze 
either, so what do I know.  Maybe the more useless the product the more 
people who will buy it?  That might explain the scooter fad as well...  
Maybe the new Saran cutting sheets... Hmmmm

Hopefully food for thought.

Later,
Adrian
