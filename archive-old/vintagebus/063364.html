&gt;Still looking for Black Sabbath's Paranoid on 8 track.  Got an 8 
&gt;track/radio in the garage, and have a stack in there.  need more
&gt;Led Zepplin.

8-track recorders go from $10 to $50 on that auction site.  Not
quite sure where to get blank 8-tracks any more but you could tape
over ones you don't want or maybe load them with blank tape.  I
think it's the same size as open-reel tape but if you use open-reel
tape for an 8-track it probably won't last as long.

http://www.8trackheaven_dot_com/index2.html has lots more.  There is
an interesting account of how these tapes were made at
http://www.8trackheaven_dot_com/ampex.html , including pictures of
the vintage 1970 hardware at Ampex.
