1958 bench seat standard runner, 1000 obo

Ad By:  Billy-165066 (1) 
Location:   Oshkosh, Wisconsin 
Category:   Vans  


Bus drives and stops. Has decent front bench, but no other interior. Has 2 
popouts and 4 louvered camper windows. A later 40 horse motor. Still 6 volt. 
All lights work. Body is in decent shape with some rust above front valance. 
Outriggers and crossmembers are rusted out. 4 new outriggers and 1 new 
crossmember included in sale. Cargo floor rust has been repaired by a PO with 
sheetmetal. Pics available. Thanks.
