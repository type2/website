...mellow...sorry no one is trying to 'force' you to
have safaris from what I recall?  And after how many
reated posts, we understand your reasoning by now.  So
that is cool!

I must say too, my buses are phenonenal drivers I
drive them all over the country and they are my only
cars just ask many listees who know me.  The point was
just as you said, a bus is a truck, and 50 year old
technology...a Porsche Boxster it ain't.  That was
what I meant and I think most folks understood
that...?

Please, try not to take everything so seriously here
(especially me I guess)...it is all just benign,
freindly bus banter ;-)

BTW, I wish Ohio was 90 year round! YIKES! guess you
have never been.  We are in the middle of the weather
spectrum...warm in summer, and cold as hell in winter.

currently freezing and getting snowed on...safaris
shut!
tds

&gt;  Yea, safaris leak and have problems and can make
&gt;  driving uncomfortable on the occasional rainy
&gt;  day...but if comfort is what one wants why the heck
&gt;  would anyone drive an old split bus anyways! With
&gt;  Safrais or not they leak, are slow, ride like crap
&gt; and
&gt;  are costly to restore...;-)

&gt; like I said, climate has a lot to do with it.  the
&gt; occasional rainy day!!!, I 
&gt; guess its almost always 90 degrees in Ohio?     If
&gt; it is when you drive your 
&gt; bus yes they are nice, but I took them out of my
&gt; driver because I drive it in 
&gt; the winter (no salt here folks) and I only used them
&gt; sometimes in the summer. 
&gt;   It was not worth the rain 300 days a year dripping
&gt; all over everything.   I 
&gt; wanted to spend time/money on getting the bus
&gt; drivable rather than fixing an 
&gt; accessory.  If I lived in Bakersfield, I'd have kept
&gt; them.   If I lived in 
&gt; Pasadena, where my bus used to be by the CALIFORNIA
&gt; NATIVE sticker on one 
&gt; safari and the tuneup tags from a Pasadena
&gt; dealership in the doorjamb, I'd 
&gt; have kept them.  If I only drove it in summer, maybe
&gt; ditto.   But I drive it. 
&gt;  In winter.   don't think a bus has to be real
&gt; expensive (except bodywork 
&gt; &amp;paint), or extremely slow (depends how fast you
&gt; like to drive, and what 
&gt; gearing your bus came with) or drive like crap.  
&gt; Then again, on the occasion 
&gt; that I drive someone else's split, I usually think
&gt; oh sheet, it needs this or 
&gt; that, cause I do feel safety is important and
&gt; comfort and warmth, and believe 
&gt; in catching up on maintenance, but then again I am
&gt; not paying shop rates for 
&gt; work, just my time and I like tinkering on the bus. 
&gt; Let a friend of a friend 
&gt; drive my 65 , he said it drove like a Cadillac,
&gt; though I think the steering 
&gt; is a little sloppy and it needs shocks, it still
&gt; drives fine.    I dislike 
&gt; the romanticism of the crappy driving bus.   Yes, it
&gt; looks like a box and it 
&gt; drives like a truck, but a good bus doesn't drive
&gt; like crap.   Bad brakes are 
&gt; stupid.  If your steering wheel has a quarter turn
&gt; of play, that was not in 
&gt; the bus design.   If you have no heat, ditto.   No
&gt; it is no luxury car, but 
&gt; it doesn't have to be a POS.   If a bus drives like
&gt; crap odds are it is 
&gt; because of 30-40 years of reduced maintenance,
&gt; rather than the integral 
&gt; vehicle itself.  so I say if you really think that,
&gt; take a good look and 
&gt; think what you need to fix your bus.  Yes it is
&gt; really hard to get everything 
&gt; perfect, but forget paint and cosmetics and safaris
&gt; now, I mean mechanicals.  
&gt; Okay it won't be like new.  Best driving bus I ever
&gt; drove had about 40K km on 
&gt; it, drove nice.  guess they were better before being
&gt; thrashed.  scuse me for 
&gt; the rant, it is kinda a pet peeve of mine.
