Subject: emulsion tube ID?

in my never-ending (and annoying... where did they all go) quest for
emulsion tubes, i found one that is NOT solex, and need an interpretation
of the #...  it is stamped PKG 60V and came outta a 34pict3, so it should
fit my 30pict 1, but i need to know if that 60 corresponds to 160 on the
solex.


anyone at least know who made this/ carb it originally went in?
