Subject: New welder-A done deal!

Thanks to everyone for some very valuable feedback
about welder choices. You all saved me some money and
some frustration because I learned that the &quot;bottom of
the line&quot; wire feed only welder is not my best choice.
 After weighing everyone's opinion, doing about 3
hours of reading and research, and checking my
financial situation, I decided to buy a Lincoln MIG
100T.  115V, can be used with or without gas, retail
price from &quot;bLowes Home improvement warehouse&quot; $327. I
really hate to shop at bLowes but I have credit there,
and I knew that I wouldn't need to ask any of their
clueless pimple faced 16 year old sales associates for
help. (I have nothing against clueless pimple faced 16
year olds, I just don't want to ask them for advice on
welders!!)
Anyway, I am going to start practicing this weekend on
an old scrap 79 bus behind my barn, and then it will
be onto re-building my new 64 bus (notice I said
re-building and NOT &quot;restoring ;^)
