&lt;&lt; there was a certain seal that seemed to belong to a 36mm axle nut and not 
a 46mm. We had to stretch it to make it go on the axle all the way to the 
bearing, past the flanges. Have any of you guys had any problems with this 
kit or have any clues on this? &gt;&gt;
Hi Mathieu,
If you mean the O-ring then it is for both/either size.  You just have to 
stretch it a bit more for the later style.  Check you axle nut tightness and 
retorque as necessary.
