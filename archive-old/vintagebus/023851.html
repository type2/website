Subject: Event Report/ Jurassic Bug-IN

Am I Tired!!

The Jurassic is over and it was a huge success! Thanks to all the
listies who came, and to those who may not have come, but help to spread
the word!

On Friday evening, we closed up the shop and began setting up the field
and lot for the next day's event. Not five minutes after closing time,
our first long-distance type2 arrived, Troy Wheeler of the Boise Bus
Pilots in his 64 deluxe hartop bus, with his son Nick and wife Kim. Not
long after he was followed by Bus Pilots Brent Carter in his bay westy
and Louie Konkol in his (Ford?) temporary replacement for a bus that he
recently lost to an uninsured drunk driver. This is one of the few
decent excuses I have ever heard for driving a ford to a VW event, the
other being towing nice barndoors and selling them to me cheap. 
That night we also had several locals camping in their splitties, and a
vacant 66 dormobile that was delivered for Rick and Susan to pick up the
next day when the arrived with teh firetruck. 

 A bit after Dark while Ty Hodges and I were putting together the &quot;guess
the part&quot; board under his 67 westy's canopy, Eric and Barb E. Arrived in
their &quot;40 horses please just pass&quot; bus, and scoped out the good swap
space they would occupy the following day. Around midnight Steve F and
Dawn Smythe arrived in their Type3 and got ready to show off the great
VW canvas they manufacture. They had a really nice color splitty bra,
which got many funny looks sitting on the hood of their III. 
After circling the wagons and some catching up, we all got to sleep just
in time for  the train to come straight through the event grounds and
scare the bajeebers out of those who were not prepared.  

The sun rose at 5:30 and so did the sleepy campers, and last minute
preparations got underway. As always, swappers were the first to turn
up, and quite a few neat buses loaded up with good stuff rolled into the
field. Mark Smith came in his barndoor loaded with cool t-shirts, and
mark Lapriore showed up with his 66 kombi towing a Puc Trailer! Very
cool! BigFoot showed in his bay singlecab, as always towing yet another
oval priced to sell. (where does he find them???) John from AutoVolksies
came in his bay panel with lots of goodies, a few other splitties I
never did identify, lots of vanagons loaded with older goodies,
including Jim Thompson with those wacky VW glasses.  By the end of the
day we had about 35 registered swappers, and several more &quot;fringe
swappers&quot; peddling their wares semi-mobily around the area. Also in
attendence were the Packrats Toys folks with their bay double and cool
toy-tent area.\

The show turned up some really cool vehicles as well. We had a gaggle of
ovals, which ended up stealing 3 of the first 5 places. All the cars
competed in teh same &quot;peoples choice&quot; class, as thsi was our first event
and we tried to keep it simple. Dustin Mitsch's 66 Riviera (with the
tent I sold him at a sacrifice price) took third place, and received one
of the really nice trophies he himself provided to the event. Susan
Crandall's afore-mentioned 66 Dormobile took 4th, tied with one of the
ovals. Other notable type2's in the show were a 74 Safari camper with
the big ol' whale of a high-roof looking permanent fiberglass top, and
the 55 firetruck with the westfalia trailer carrying the 36hp waterpump
and firehoses. The Firetruck was in a non-competing class of its own, as
it is a many time show winner at bigger events, and would have been an
unfair ringer. I had to buck hay for several hours at the Crandall Ranch
a couple weeks ago in trade for their bringing the Firetruck to our
event. I'd do it again. It's about the coolest type2 you could ever hope
to see at a show.

The &quot;guess the part&quot;  board was won by a cooperative efort by the Boise
Bus Pilots, and the Hazet Screwdriver set we raffled off was won by Bus
Pilot Troy Wheeler, after he had already left ( he will probably find
out about it by reading this). 

The event t-shirts are almost all somd out, perhaps 10 left. They come
in many bright colors, all 100% cotton, with the jurassic Bug-in
Stegasaurus cut-away to show that he has just eaten an oval window bug,
and the split screen dragon-fly at the bottom representing us type2
types. If you may want one, email me or call and I may still have your
size. $14 and I will send em free.

Total number for people attending are estimated at about 400. We had
almost 100 ballots cast at the show, 25 cars entered, about 40 swappers,
and quite a few cool vehicles for sale or otherwise unofficial to the
swap or show.

Hope everyone is having a great time in Portland today. Sposed to be Hot
Hot Hot!
