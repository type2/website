Hi Irie,
You can replace the tranny nose mount without taking the tranny all the way 
out by removing all the mounting bolts and up front releasing the E-brake 
cable ends and then sliding the tranny backward.  If you are having leakage 
where you say you do and if you have not replaced the rear shift linkage 
bushings then just take out the tranny and fix/replace/grease all the worn 
parts!   Eric&amp;Barb
