&gt; Maybe the ideal  thing would be to lay down a coat of Eric&amp; Barb's bombproof

Yes. Lay down the protective primer, and let it dry really well. Your
options after this are to get really crazy and spray POR15 on, then in 2
hours when it gets tacky, spray on a light, but covering coat of your
paint system's primer, or to just spray on several coats of primer that
you intend to sand thru. either way, you will spray several coats either
with a non-porous hidden layer of POR underneath, or just the sanding
layers of primer. I went for the craziness in many instances when I
restored the 67, esp around the window openings and such. I got a kick out
of hiding a POR layer within the paint-work. I'm easily amused.
