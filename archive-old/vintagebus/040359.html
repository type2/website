John et al,
 
Thanks for the advice. I think these heads only had about 1000 miles on the valves before I put them in, giving me about 4000 total on them now.

What I did over the weekend was pull that plug (#1) and slowly I felt the threads as I put it back in. I used my ninja-vw-stealth powers to become one with the machine, grasshopper. I found that there was quite a bit of thread below where I had snugged down. I got the plug lined up just right and slowly led it into the base.

I will now continue to drive and see how she responds. I have an insert in the bus' spare parts and I'll keep it around. It's not a helicoil, so I don't know if I'll actually be able to install it if the plug blows for good...hmmm...maybe I'll get a helicoil too (or tap-it suggested by eric&amp;barb--is that a joined or split personality ;)...).

Interestingly, I found that ALL my plugs were at least a little loose. I tightened them, but not as a gorilla would. &quot;Make yourself one with the force, Luke.&quot;

I'll keep you all posted, but I suspect this easy fix will be fine until I get around to fixing up a good spare head and swapping.

Thanks! Joe
