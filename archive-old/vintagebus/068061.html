&gt; The lower link pin on the passenger side was frozen in the spindle!  (that

&gt; that were sliding around in there! I should have checked those sooner.

Hi Sean,
That is the reason when we get a bus we take the front spindles off the bus 
and disassemble the link pins for a good cleaning and inspection!  Quite 
often we have been able to save the link pins and thier needle bearings by 
doing this.  Because the old grease inside them has turned into puddy and and 
will not allow the new grease you pump in there to spread evenly and push out 
the old grease especially out the outer cap which has a small hole for the 
old grease to go out of and is almost always plugged.
