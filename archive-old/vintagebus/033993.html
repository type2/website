&lt;&lt; So if a 57 has no codes for color and such aka m-codes then whats the best 
 step in finding it out?
  &gt;&gt;
what model is it?   There are only a few usual colours choices per model

also look at door jambs or places it hasn't been painted over

you can write the factory, but that is generally not needed.
