After an orgy of bodywork - 5 - 7 hours *per nite* - the '55 westy should
be getting a nice coat of dove blue paint tomorrow morning.

Will have pix as they become available.

My plan was to get paint on it, because after Wednesday, I won't be able to
as much as *walk* much less work on a car...  While I'm incapacatated, it
can be drying.
