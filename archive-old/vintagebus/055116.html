Subject: What is my camper type???

Hey folks I need some learned help identifying the type of camper conversion
I have, there are no name plates etc., but I have several identifying
characteristics plus I found a bus on Everett's site that looks just like
mine so can you click on the link below and tell me who owns the balck and
red bus on the upper left or can you figure out what type of interior it is?
Mine is a 1961 panelvan.  You'll notice that the one on Everett's site has
what appears to be a faucet sticking out the side of the fridge cabinet, I
have just a hole there.  My windows are identical to this bus.  Other
identifiers in mine:

1.  Red ice box w/a decal of an eagle, red cross (like the swiss flag) and
the VW logo on the outside, inside says &quot;Mobile Metal Products, Gardena,
California&quot;
2.  The rear seat folds out to a bed on a grooved wooden raceway which is
visible when the seat is in the up right position.

I have lots of interior pics I could email you individually if you think you
might know.  Here's the link to Everett's site, do you know the owner or the
interior?  Many thanks.  Don.
