Subject: re:clutch cable broken

actually...this morning i disconnected the cable, and it appears to move
freely inside it's tube.

but the clutch pedal does not want to move too freely, so i imagine it has
some crude inside the pivot sheath, maybe the seal is leaking...so i am
trying to get the clutch pedal lever out, but it seems to be really stuck in
there...any suggestions on getting it out. i have tapped it lightly with a
hammer, and tried prying, i don't want to break it(i guess that is obvious)
but i am not sure how much force i can put on this thing...
