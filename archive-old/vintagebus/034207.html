If you already have a DC '67, why would you want to upgrade?  A well tended
MC should last for some time.  I believe I have my original on my '67.

Plus keeping it original...

Now,if you had a '66 or earlier, different situation.

Ronnie at Old Volks ( http://www.type2parts_dot_com/ ) has the 1967 -- ATE
Original (made in Germany) -- for $150.  He also has the wheel cylinders,
brake hoses, and other goodie German parts.
