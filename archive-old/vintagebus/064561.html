Subject: Re: [VB] Tire pressure/ gas mileage

Recently I checked the air in my tires.   It was low.  Since the temp dropped 
from the 80s a few weeks ago to high 50s/low 60s as of recently, that isn't 
really too surprising.   Bus handles better (corners) and seems to get better 
milage.  Though I only filled it once since checking the air pressure.
