Subject: Re: [VB] re:heaters

&gt;I use the Mr heater,available for 89.00 from sportsmans guide 9,000 btu,



oh yeah, sportsmansguide!! hate to let this little secret outta the 
bag, but that guy rocks! my bus (no, my HOUSE) is stuffed with things 
- mostly mil-spec - from his catalog. i have a tote full of camping 
gear in the bus at all times, nothing but military surplus camping 
equipment and clothes... mostly german to boot! i work on the bus in 
used german tanker overalls :) $5!!

and btw - if you go to sportsmansguide_dot_com and buy stuff, GET THE 
CLUB MEMBERSHIP. you WILL buy enough crap to make it worth it. trust 
me.




as for the mr  heater buddy - yeah, it is good for a small space, 
like a bus or a tent - i'm trying to think of a way to vent it, like 
maybe a little sheet metal hood out a window, to cut down on the 
moisture. i was simply leaving my coleman propane lantern on -low- 
all night, which worked, but not as well.
and as far as CO2 from this heater; i slept in the bus at greg 
silkenson's campout last year and brought a CO2 meter from home, 
propped it up on the seatback. this model had a recall function; CO2 
ppm never went above something like 12.  i got a higher reading 
standing on a streetcorner with it!
if you have new seals i imagine your count  would be higher, but i'm 
betting not much.
(these things are good for heaterbox leaks, too... if you smell funk, 
stick one by a dash vent and drive around; no CO2 jump means it is 
prolly just oil dripping on your boxes and cooking off, not an 
exhaust leak into the system)
