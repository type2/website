Keep the fire burning!  The Westy needs funding!

I put up some more early literature as well as a nice Sapphire III radio, a nice set of bus rear bumper splashpans, factory workshop bulletins in a 2 ring binder from '64, and a 2 volume set of 1963 Transporter Factory Workshop Manuals in excellent condition.  I figured this stuff isn't doing me any good sitting in the closet, I need to get my bus on the road so some of the treasures must move on.

No reserves except on the workshop manuals.  Go into search and do a &quot;seller search&quot; for rdavis_at_sbch_dot_org.  Be a pal, bid $.50!

Robert
