  Due to the fact my mother just purchased a karmann ghia that will be
coming out to my place for repairs, I am selling this bus. (no more room
at the inn!) This bus is a little hacked up and has rust in all the
normal spots. The bus has a custom 70's &quot;Shagen-Wagen&quot; interior kit that
includes; a fancy shag carpeted ply-wood fold out bed, a set of great
bass boat seats, and a furry beer cooler. The body mods on this bus are;
cut wheel-wells and missing the bulkhead behind the front seats. I have
wheel wells out of my parts bus I am willing to include if interested.
The bus is located in easteren Ohio and the price is $600 obo/trade (I
really need a westy interior) Pics. are on my web-page!
    I am also having a VW picnic at my home on saturday May 13 if anyone
is in the eastren Ohio area and would like to attend p-mail me for
directions.
