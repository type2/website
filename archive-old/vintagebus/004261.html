Hi all again !!

In the process of reviving my split 1962, ive found a complete BODY of a 62
also !!  Its clearly in good shape, surface rust only but have no rotting
and got all his beam in good shape + rocker metal hard!!  Well all it need
its a sandblast + a paint ...  because its really juste a Body ...no
windows, no mechanic....

...and the guy let it go at 800 $ CA !!  Well what da ya think ... is that a
great price...because i got all other part on my 1962 .. but mine is pretty
rusty/rotten ... i just use my calculator to see that it will cost me around
700-900 $ just for metal part (floor,rocker...)

I just want to have your blessing in that purchase.. or if there is a Clean
Body cheaper that u may have in your backyard.. hehehe

Tx all
