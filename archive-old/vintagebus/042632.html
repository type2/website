Subject: [VB] revised directions to Missouri Bus Fallout THIS WEEKEND!(nov 19-21)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.9911181539270.4417-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

you may have seen my last post on the Missouri Bus fallout, occuring this
weekend.  Starting at around 6pm on friday and continuing until early
sunday afternoon.  If you feel like coming on down/up drop me a line or
just show up.

I have a few confirmations from attendees and its shaping up to be a fun
weekend.  The weather here has been in the 60's and it is forecast to be
60 on saturday and 65 on sunday for the high, 40 to 50 for the low. 

anyway, i went out to reconnoiter the area last night and realized that my
directions had a mistake, and so here i go with the updated ones...

take highway 70 west from saint louis or east from kansas city..
go north on highway 61 (14 miles approx)
go RIGHT (east) on highway 47 (3 miles approx)
go left (north) on highway 147 (this goes right to the middle of the park)
at the visitor center in the park take a right
follow the signs as they point to &quot;campground&quot;
the last sign will say &quot;basic campsites --&gt;&quot; and that is where we'll be :)

The campsites we will be in are up on a ridge and quite nice.  The park is
pretty empty this time of year so we should have almost the whole place to
ourselves :)  Camping fees are $5.00 per site and the sites can be shared,
bringing the expense down quite a bit.

i will be there at 6:00 pm or so on friday, hope to see you :)

thanks,

Steve

p.s. sorry not to wait till tomorrow, i wanted to make sure the corrected
directions got to all who needed them.
