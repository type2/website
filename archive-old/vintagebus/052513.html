Subject: Re: [VB] Wiring through bellypans?

That's a real good question, I never looked, though I had the opportunity 
with some holey deluxes.  I would say yes indeed, I am sure they have the 
clips. Are you replacing it with a new harness ?   The best thing to do is 
tie a long sturdy string to the end of the harness and pull the harness out 
so the string stays in the harness' place,

so when you want to install a harness, you can tie the string to it and pull 
it through.  Then you wont be able to bend the clips over.  hm,  still that 
should be better than unde rthe subfloors, right?

why are you doing this ?  I mean you are implying you want to put the same 
harness back in, soi what is wrong?

&lt;&lt; Hello all,
 
 Ronnie, John Howard, Matt Earle &amp; I am working to replace my wiring harness 
 this weekend and were discussing the issue of the securing clips that run 
 along the frame rail.
 
 On buses equiped with belly pans, are these clips in place? We want to make 
 sure that we can get the old wiring out (and fish wire in) without breaking 
 it.
 
 Thanks,
 
 ~Rich &gt;&gt;
