This was never more so than when I moved to Hawaii. On walking in the rain
forest many 's the occasion that Id find a tea leaf wrapped around a rock as
an offering to the deities there. (funny how I became a bible thumping
fundamentalist)

Or was that metaphor a reference to the triune god of Volks Types I, II &amp; III
(with a nod to other &quot;things&quot; and shwimmers...)
The common engine is what gets us into fellowship.

I don't know how to ask this so I'll forge ahead. Has anyone seen a set of
machine fit 88's for sale? And I don't remember if this is the right word *
Binaural *  but having aluminum outside and sleeved iron inside. Any ways my
&quot;ultimate bus engine&quot; would have a set of these and a non welded offset
ground crank with a pic 28 off of a formula vee. And dare I say it, Ported SP
heads.
What I'm looking for is power in mergeing and on ramps. The current 1600cc,
pic 30, with stock muffler has all the top speed the Kombi legally needs. so
in another 80k miles...

off to the races

bible thumping religious right dittos to all TF&amp;KLM and art bell listeners
out there.
