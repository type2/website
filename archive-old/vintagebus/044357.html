Subject: #3 intake tight again....

Hey all,

RE: '59 Kombi, 1600 DP engine, recently overhauled, about 3000 miles 
on the engine. I had the heads rebuilt when i overhauled the engine.

I was having trouble with my engine and it turned out the #3 intake 
valve was tight. i adjusted it to .006 and drove it a total of maybe 
3 days (150 miles). Engine acting bad again. Turns out #3 intake 
valve is tight again. So I just adjusted it once again to .006.

So I'm guessing I need to get an exchange on the rebuilt head....or 
get a set of new ones...right?

What exactly is happening with this valve and what causes it?

Just trying to learn a little more about engines.
