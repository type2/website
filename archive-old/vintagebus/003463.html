We are planning a trip to Newfoundland this summer, probably a month or so,
in our '65 Westy. I am kind of thinking of pulling the original engine and
putting in a fresh, brand new one. What is the difference between the new
engines places like Scat sells, and the Bettlemex engine? The price is
about the same it seems. Are they both new Mexican built?  thanks, Jim

     Weird, we're planning a trip to Newfoundland in our 65 EZ Camper this
summer!! We're going in May. We want to hit Busses on the Blue Ridge and
then head up North.
     I rebuilt the engine myself last year. It wasn't near as bad as I
thought it was going to be. I had the help of a local VW mechanic watching
over my shoulder. It was an enlightening experience.
