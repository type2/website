Subject: [VB] 36hp vs. 40hp thermostats
Message-Id: &lt;991027133443EK.15699_at_webd1.mail_dot_com&gt;

This should be easy:   (not!)

What are the differences between the 36hp and 40hp stale-air warm-up systems?  Specifically, I would like to know the following:
1. What, if any, differences exist between the 2 thermostats?  Length, temperature range, etc..
2. Assuming there is a difference between the 2 systems, what is the easiest/quickest way to differenciate between the 2?

The reason I ask is I know that the 40 hp &quot;throttle ring&quot; is supposed to be set to open wider when fully warmed up so I was wondering if any of the connecting rods/linkages are shorter/longer or if the thermostat is taller to allow for this.

Thank you,
