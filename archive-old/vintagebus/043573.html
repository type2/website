&gt;BTW, we are possibly going to lose a good So. CA VW shop in the near
&gt;future.  Got word at Pomona that the owner of Kymco is quitting.
&gt;Selling the building too.

I thought I read, here or elsewhere, that Kymco was supposed to have
one of the &quot;big&quot; pieces of equipment for machining cases, which some
consider superior to the &quot;small&quot; or &quot;portable&quot; equipment that is
more common.  I don't know the details and I don't want to start 
a flame war about engine rebuilders or methods, but if this is true,
hopefully another VW place will purchase the equipment...
