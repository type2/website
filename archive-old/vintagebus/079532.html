Subject: Re: [VB] Karl's 66 Deluxe - Ouch! 

Bummer!!!!!  glad he's okay.  Take it easy Karl.

Same thing happened to some friend of mine with a 65 21window,  at least they 
got insurance money from the guy who ran the red light in front of them.  
That bus ended up with a nose transplant and back on the road!!!

See pics at  http://66.34.72.138/gallery/image/2100705.JPG.  Karl 
t-boned a car that cut in front of him. He was tossed out the driver's 
door and woke up 5-10 minutes later with bumps, bruises and a cut ear. 
He's standing, but the bus won't be back on the road. Guess he'll take 
it apart and haul the pieces down to OCTO next week.
