They sell a special thinner... really freaking expensive. You can only 
thin por15 a certain percentage...

The &quot;special&quot; thinner smells and feels to me just like high quality paint
thinner, but i like my bus enough to do it right (in case it is actaully
different) and im too cheap to send it to a lab to see if they really are
selling me white mineral spirits for about 1000% higher than full retial.

take care,

Steve

p.s. i used to be a painter B4 computer work, and i would swear thats what
they are doing... Paint thinner is rather distinctive smelling/feeling
(kinda slippery on your fingers in a way...)
