Subject: [VB] Headliner Beading


I can't seem to find anything in the archives on this. Has anyone found a
place to obtain the beading that finishes off the headliner (it jams in
between the roof and the lower window section) your speedy responses would
be great because our headliners going in on Monday. Thanks. Chris &amp; Gina
