Subject: re: tent (or other) storage

Common sense when storing a tent...
ANYTHING that stresses the fabric is Not Good. So you 
fold it so that no fabric is stretched needlessly. Nice 
and loose. No rolling it into a fattie, then folding it 
in half that stretches the outer part because it's 
forced over all the other stuff. Nice gentle folds that 
don't pull anything. Envision your own bag of skin 
being folded for storage. 
Dry is good. Put it away on a dry day. A big garbage 
bag will preserve that day, otherwise a partially 
opened bag of cheap charcoal briquets in an airtight 
enclosure will absorb moisture and oders from nearly 
anything and a lot cheaper than some volcanic ash BS 
you can spend dumb money on. Check &amp; replace mid winter 
nonetheless. A stack of dry newspaper will do the same 
and can be changed often. They'll become as 'wet' as 
the tent, so if you change it during the cold dry 
winter, it'll dry it out. A big shot of carbon dioxide 
will kill any bug and mold depending on oxygen. Find 
your local home brewer, they use CO2 by the tankfull.
