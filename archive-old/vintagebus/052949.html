&gt;The thing that held me back for the longest time was the emergency
&gt;flashers, I just couldn't figure out a way to get all four turnsignals
&gt;to flash yet remain independent. (I don't have any special
&gt;many-pronged VW relay.)

Stock, your Bus wouldn't have had the &quot;9 prong box&quot; - it would have
had a four-pronged relay, item J1 in the wiring diagram.  See this
link for more:

&gt;Some odd effects, when the ignition is off but the hazards on, and
&gt;then the brake pedal is applied, the low oil / generator lamps and
&gt;the fuel gauge flash along with the hazards. I think I know why but
&gt;don't care to do anything about it.

This is inherent in the design and there's not much you can do about
it.  A strategically placed diode would fix it, but would also introduce
another 0.6v to 1.0v voltage drop to your brake lights.  If your Bus
is still 6 volt, this means your brake light brightness would be reduced
by 30% to 50%.  A 12 volt Bus would fare a bit better and &quot;only&quot; lose
17% to 30% or so.  Since you need your brake lights more than your
hazard flashers, it's a reasonable trade-off.
