Subject: Re: Changes to CrewCabs 1959 - 1967

thought i'd post a quick note... most folks have let the &quot;12v -  started in
66&quot;  line pass w/o comment. the 65 s/c i have (born week of may 5, 65 (same
as me :)!  )  is a factory 12v, mcode, sticker on the dash and all.
which makes it cooler, but makes me dread the day the wipers cease to work!
