Subject: post-55 Vent Window (Driver Side ) Needed
Date: Mon, 25 Sep 2000 11:47:01 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello All,

Yesterday I put my thumb through my driver's side vent window in my late '55
Single Cab... I guess the glass must be really brittle from age as the
outside edge was bubbly and only a slight pressure shattered the window.  I
felt terrible and now the bus looks very unhappy.  So I am now in need of a
driver's side vent window, preferably original with a good seal and latch...
any color is fine as the bus needs painting anyways.  Thanks in advance for
leads.

Tom
PS: Are all non-barndoor splitty doors and vent windows interchangeable?
