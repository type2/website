Kirt-
I looked all over for a front floor pan reproduction that covers more than the
ones from the various dealers.  I was not able to find any.  The only options
that I found was to:
1) Find an NOS front floor (very rare, but out there).
2) Find a good used front floor.
3) Fabricate a new floor with sheetmetal.

The only revision NOS front floor that I found was for a 66-67.  There are
still a few floating around if you look real hard.  Mine was about $250.

You can call a few of the well known bus bone yards and ask about used floors.

If you decide to go the fabricated route,  I suggest that you e-mail my good
friend  Kelly Brown.  He is located at MetWiz2_at_AOL_dot_com.  He lives in Archdale,
N.C.  Kelly has done some really great things in bus restoration.  That's why
we call him &quot;The Metal Wizard&quot;.

Hope this helps-
Scott Holtman
