Subject: Re: [VB] Back on list w/ a fine(?) vehicle!

'65 single cab with a claimed 26,000 miles.  Claimed to have been
restored
about ten years back. 
----------------------------
I know I'm talking about a much newer bus but my 83 has over 300,000
miles on it and it doesn't have any of the problems you mention.
Even an old ragged 66 Westy I bought drives and runs very well.
This price would be right if it were ready to show at a competition
event.
I'm just hoping that you didn't really pay that much.
