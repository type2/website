That's why I use blue foam cut to fit with paper patterns and glued into place
with H-2 cement.

Here's my .02

I had a panel bus that that PO used fiberglass insulation in to quite it
down.  Unfortunately when I went to restore the vehicle and removed the
panels, I found the bus was rusting from the inside out.  The fiberglass
insulation only needed to get a little bit of water on it and the watter
would wick its way up the inside of the panel.  The water would then sit on
the inside of the panel with the fiberglass and cause all kinds of rust.
IT WAS A HUGE MESS.  Since that little experience, I would not put
fiberglass in unless you could make sure it didn't get wet.

Just my experience, take it for what its worth.
Mike
