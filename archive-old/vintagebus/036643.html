Gene Berg Ent is now making some pieces to modify your existing Dog house to
fit a type IV cooler.  From what they were saying and what I saw, it is a
modifyed &quot;hump&quot; offset that allows for the larger cooler.  It requires you
to cut off the old hump and then pop rivit the new offset piece on.  

Saw it at the Classic.  It looked pretty slick.  Didn't get a price, though.
sorry

Call them to get any real details.  I am just re-calling what I can.

I'm going to put a T4 oil cooler on my 1600 engine.  I've got a nice used
cooler and adaptor all cleaned up (spent about half an hour scrubbing every
nook and cranny) and when I put the 2 together, my assumptions were correct
that only 1 of the 3 bolts was long enough to pass thru the cooler.  The 2
bolts up by the oil passages fall way short of passing thru the cooler.  I
need 11/16&quot; more of the 6mm stud or about a 4&quot; long 6mm stud.

Does anyone have a couple I could buy?  Thanks for the help.

One more thing - who remembers what magazine issue (either hotvws or vwt)
detailed the modification to the fan shroud to accept the bigger cooler?

Thanks all.
