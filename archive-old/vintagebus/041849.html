&gt; Amen!   Once again the driver of this list is asleep at the wheel.

Apparently you are of the opinion that the list administrator sits there
constantly and monitors all of the posts in real time, trashing the ones
that don't meet the standards of the list charter.  Sorry, but that is not
the way that it works.

Every post that gets sent to the list is immediately resent to the entire
list unless it gets trapped by a rather narrow set of automatic filters.
The only recourse that the admin has if an inappropriate post is made is
to either reason with the poster or to moderate or ban the poster.  ON the
type2 list, I chose to send the fellow an e-mail telling him not to do
this again.  This is Thom's list, so he will make his own decision.

The alternative is a completely moderated list where every post would have
to be approved by the admin(s) before others would see it.  I doubt that
you would want to wait a day for your posts to appear!

If you would like real-time moderation, I would be willing to quit my day
job and take on the task.  With 1000 listees, I figure that each of you
would only have to kick in about $65 each per year to cover my salary and
benefits!
