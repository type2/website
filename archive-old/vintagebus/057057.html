&gt; 
&gt; Yeah...for what it costs to buy one cylinder of NOS Stuttgart air,
&gt; you can buy a whole engine for a Bus!  :)  And the air gets expensive
&gt; fast, since you have to run it in the *engine* as well as the tires...

Not only that, but you have endless debates over what the *starting*
pressure should be, and you have to invest in a pyrometer to test to
see what the temp is right when you get off the track.

&gt; I think you should race the Porsche for a while until people get used
&gt; to seeing you in it.  Then put a hitch on it, tow the &quot;Westy&quot; trailer
&gt; to the track with the Porsche, and go out on the track in your Bus... 

I don't think they'd let it on the track because it doesn't have 3-point
or better belts.
