Subject: POR-15 Tie-Coat Primer comments?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Has anyone used the POR-15 Tie-Coat primer and would like to comment on his 
or her experience?  I have primed the bottom and some of the inside of my 
project with silver POR-15, and there is no way I can sand all the knooks and 
crannies for topcoating.  This Tie-coat primer is supposed to go over POR-15 
without sanding, and I was wondering if folks have had success with it.  I 
noticed it was polyurethane isocyanate (which is good in my book), but it is 
single component, so I am warry.  I plan to topcoat with Glasurit 22 line.

Here is the info on the Tie-Coat primer:

My Dupont supplier recommends Dupont Prime 'N Seal 2600/2700 to do the same 
thing (stick without sanding the substrate).  This is a non-sanding 
primer-sealer which does not require sanding before topcoating.  

Thoughts appreciated, Tom Good in Vermont
