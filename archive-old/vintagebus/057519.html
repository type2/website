&gt;In my rant about my bus I was trying to remember the worst, most extreme
&gt;climbs I ever drove.

Maybe I just need to make more long drives in my camper, but here are
mine:

* Most hills in San Francisco.	The Lombard St. area in particular.

* Cuesta Grade just north of San Luis Obispo

* Didn't take the bus on this one, but I imagine that Priest Grade along
Hwy 120 toward Yosemite would hurt pretty good as well as the approach
into Lassen Volcanic Park.  I'll hit those someday, never fear.
