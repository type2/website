Subject: turn signal switch

   Mine doesnt slide down, but just moves when youu hit it to turn it on.  I 
put a little piece of rubber (like bike tube) on the inside of it and that 
stopped it from moving enough. I think you could probably also machine, 
grind, whatever one of the ends to make it 'smaller'. In other words it will 
tighen up onto the column instead of just tightening onto itself and being 
loose on the column. Let me know if you dont understand what i mean. Im not 
a man of words. or mystery. ;)
