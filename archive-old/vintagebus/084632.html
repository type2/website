Subject: Re: [VB] Porsche Pulley

Phil,  that is not nearly all the parts needed.

Call Mark Dearing to help you out on all the parts.

This weekend in goofing around I found that the 15345 belt worked best for 
me.

As a special hint I had to &quot;space&quot; the front pulley half (remember Front is 
front) with one shim to get it off the generator itself to prevent rubbing.

Also it needs all 10 shims to work right.

No road time yet due to a carb and/or fuel pump issue :(  grrr

Good Luck,
Adrian Pillow
