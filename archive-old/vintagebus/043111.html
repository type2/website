This from experience....Bugs slam into your teeth?????  spit em out GOOD.
On a long Bike ride down I-5 thru the San Fernando Valley some years
ago...had a bug get me...awhile later...pretty sure the trots big time
were from that critter.  After all, I hadn't even made it to Tijuana yet,
so that wasn't it!
later
