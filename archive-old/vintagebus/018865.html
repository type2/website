Excellent Bay Riviera top, canvas and assemblies
available at Ecology Wrecking on 27th Ave in Phoenix,
AZ.

If anyone is working on a bay and wants to convert to
or fix existing Riviera and need a complete top that
is the place to go. Most of the interior is gone but
the top etc.is definitely worth nabbing if that is
your thing.

Also spotted two more bays and several Beetles with
engines and/or trannys and one early (pre-68) bumper
set. Engines arent worth busting a knuckle over.
Typical locked and loaded fodder.
