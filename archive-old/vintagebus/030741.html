Subject: Westy tent brackets

Hi all,

The front tent bracket on my 61 westy is broken.  I remember when Thom,
put the tent on the panel he used repro roof brackets, but I never saw
where they came from.  Anybody know where to get them?  I'm trying to
find a way to mount an old sundial tent that came out of my old 65 to my
westy until I find a tent.

Also, there are a couple of rotted areas of the canvas, are there any
ideas on how to fix this?  I was going to go buy some heavy canvas
material and use contact adhesive to adhere it to the underside.  This
way, I would keep some of the integrity of the tent.  Has anybody done
this?  Is there anything I can soak the fabric in to rejuvenate it so
its not so brittle?
