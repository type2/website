&gt; We agree that the Kennedy PP is probably overkill, unless you are drag

Hello Guys    I haven't had any problems with the diaphram stle PP . I only 
use new SACHs .  I also have the stock nine spring on some of my buses and like 
them better cause of the release seems smoother and easier to push which 
really please the wife.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service
