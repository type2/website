I have just finished lowering my &quot;63 Sundial. I haven't brought it up on the
list before because I'm sure to get flamed.

I went lower solely to get highway speed in the extremely agressive, keep up
or die traffic here in Dallas. I had a '68 bug tranny built and used a
straight axle kit. In the front I got new spindles, all from Wolfgang.
Anything you want to know about lowering, without the abusive editorial, ask
John or Steve at Wolfgang. They absolutely know everything you're going to
run into and are always willing to spend the time with you. Their
encouragement saved the project for me several times. I spent alot of money
with them, but not enough to justify all the time they spent with me.

I did all my own work and, never having done ANY extensive auto work in my
life, am totally exhausted. I did everything wrong at least once. If you do
all the work yourself I don't think it can properly be done without:

1. A central project advisor (John and/or Steve at Wolfgang)

2. A good and helpful parts house (In Dallas, Knight's Auto and V-Dud Folks)

3. A good close-by vintage parts source/junk yard (Glen at Pistons and
Plugs, technically a repair shop, but with LOTS of old parts)

4. A good friend or relative who used to work for VW, not to do the work,
but to look at what you are trying to do or what you did wrong and
straighten you out. (My brother-in-law)

It took me a month ( I didn't go to work alot) and about $1500. Yesterday I
did the tie rods over, after finding out that you must build and adjust the
the rods to a straight steering wheel and not vice versa, and hit the
interstate. The steering is solid and I have 70 MPH at about 3200 RPM. I
still get passed like I'm standing still, but I'm not the slowest thing on
the road.

I drove a '60 bus in the mid 1970's, crossed the Continental Divide from
Oregon to Denver many times and changed engines like they were batteries (in
those days, if I recall, which I can't, they were about $80) and I think
what I have now is a marked improvement, for me, over what I drove in those
days. I never wanted a hot rod, just a reliable, a little more stable Bus
that didn't wear it's little heart out trying to keep up.

I am WAY happy.

&gt; OK....I know this is not for the purist....
&gt;
&gt; but lowered buses sure do look cool........SO.......
&gt;
&gt; whats the best way to lower a bus and keep a good ride......and what
shocks
&gt; that do not bottom out .........
&gt;
&gt; before the flames start.......
&gt;
&gt; 2-3 inches  at the most, but others might be interested in more of the
&quot;lawn
&gt; mower&quot; look
&gt;
&gt; Keep the  stock tranny + RGB......
&gt; or use a type 3 tranny
&gt; or use an IRS set-up
&gt;
&gt; someone mentioned they set-up a rack + pinion steering on their bus , any
&gt; pics ?
&gt; the stock steering box  gets in the way if you really dump it ......
&gt;
&gt; Any tricks on putting the rear wheels/tires on ?
&gt; on my only lightly lowered bus (2-3 inches) with flat wheelwells you have
to
&gt; let
&gt; the air out of the tires and jack the springplates down......
&gt;
&gt; Lastly any ideas on lowereing a stock bus just for the day for a photo
shoot ?
&gt; I was thinking of going to home dept and getting a pallet of sand........
&gt;
&gt; Hopefully this will get the list movinfg again.......
&gt;
&gt; and for all those that hate lowered buses.....just remember that at  least
&gt; they are being used and in later years can be  UN-lowered  if the new
owner
&gt; wants
&gt;
&gt; Let the games begin.......
&gt;
