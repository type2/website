hi everyone.  alot of people have asked me why i go by &quot;hazetguy&quot;.   i
dislike &quot;strap-on&quot; and &quot;craps-man&quot; tools.  i don't like their finish. i
don't like the way they feel in my hand.  i like Hazet.
i followed this urge and a while ago became somewhat of a dealer for a
hazet supplier.  i haven't advertised this too much, but those who know me
know i do this on the side.  the prices are ususally less than snap-on, but
a tad more than craftsman.  they are fully warrantied.
anyway, i can order any CURRENTLY produced Hazet tool and CURRENTLY
produced VW specialty tool, water cooled included.  sometimes i can get
older hazet stuff and older specialty tools, but not very often.  i don't
have a catalog to send everyone, but if you go to:
hazet_dot_de     and click on the british flag emblem (for english), you can
get a good idea what they have.
i will be happy to order tools for anyone on the list, or others, on the
following terms:  payment must be received within 3 weeks of the order. 
that's it.
any questions, please p-mail me.
i'm off to drive my bus to gilroy today, with rachel.
