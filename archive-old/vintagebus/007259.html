Me, i like the balance between digital and analog. its nice to work on a
system where the components are not completely discrete from each other and
dysfunction is gradual, linear and approachable by wistful thinking. Most
human.
     digital world is highly modular and human input is minimised. What
there is is mostly blocky and not like people at all. A good eye and feel
for a machine is of no use. The VW on the other hand......
