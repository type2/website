Subject: Re: [VB] Hot weather oil

I've used nothing but Mobil 1 for over 10 years.  I have 183,000 miles on
my Toyota truck with no repairs on the lubricated parts, which has had
Mobil 1 since the first oil change.

Also have 163,000 on my Mazda 626 Turbo, but have only owned it since 142,000.

The aircraft industry went to synthetics years ago for the obvious
performance benefits (flash point, viscosity stability, resistance to
breakdown).  Air cooled VWs have some things in common with aircraft
engines.  Why not use the best (not necessarily Mobil brand), instead of
constantly searching for an acceptable substitue?

Oh yes, I use the 15-50 weight year round.
