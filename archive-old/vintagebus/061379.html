Subject: Re: [VB] New VW Micro Bus IS HERE!!!!

I wonder if Mattel had to pay VWoA, or they just
chalked it up to free advertising. Either way, that's
a fair representation of who will be driving the real
ones when they come out. Imagine all the soccer balls
you could fit in there, not to mention yellow and/or
black lab's!
