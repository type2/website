Hello everyone,

I have searched the archives and found an old post from Jim Thompson stating 
that he had a copy of VW's 1963 instructions for installing safari windows.  
Both of the email addresses listed for him have not worked, does anyone know 
of his current contact info, or more directly, does anyone have a copy of 
said instructions they would be willing to copy and mail to me?

TIA,

Mike Anderson
