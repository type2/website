I think all the bay-window tanks will fit.

Get the filler neck and connecting hose, as well as the tank.  Using a chisel
or grinder, remove the triangular collar from the new filler neck.
You'll also need to extend the straps that hold down the tank.

I think it's 15 gallons, vs 10 gallons.

&gt; I'm considering replacing the stock fuel tank in my '66 E-Z Camper with a larger tank from a baywindow bus to increase my range on long trips.  What I needed to know is what year(s) of bus has a compatible tank with my splitty and what is the capacity of these tanks??  Also, what parts are necessary from the donor bus for the conversion??  Thanks for the help.

Thom
