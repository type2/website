Wow, you leave town for a few days and the mail really backs up!  I just
returned to NC from Texas where I rescued a very straight 67 Westy shell
from the boneyard.  It's the perfect match for my current 67 on which a tree
fell.

Anyone know where I can find a set of used rear drums and bearings?  They
don't have to be any good, just something worn and cheap so I can get the
shell rolling.

Recently there was a thread about where to get 46mm sockets and 3/4 breaker
bars.  I found &quot;Proto&quot; in the archives.  Anyone have a URL where you can
order such things or know of any keywords I can search on?

Also, the shell I bought had safari's at one time.  Anyway to tell if the
brackets are original or aftermarket?

Thanks for all the responses a while back on trying to figure out what type
my bus is.  I checked out Thom's site as suggested.  Judging from the
pictures in the FAQ, my Westy is built on a Kombi.  Why else would it have a
window in the closet?  :-)

Thanks,
Mike
