&lt;&lt; Does anybody know the fair market price for a original bottle and cap for
 a 65 bus?  Someone gave me a price at the Classic but I am shocked to say
 the least.  Anybody?.......jon
  &gt;&gt;
a good cap is worth not less that $50 by itself.  As the caps tend to get 
cracked rubber and become less functional.  As bottles are more common, that 
part is worth less.  Someone found a bunch of NOS caps a few years back, they 
were going for about $60 a piece at shows.  All gone now, of course.   I 
would not be shocked to see a $75 price tag on a good cap and bottle.  Never 
been to the classic, hear sometimes prices are really high
