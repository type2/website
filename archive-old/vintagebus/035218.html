Subject: 40 HP rebuild questions
Date: Wed, 23 Feb 2000 12:26:24 -0500

Well, I'm finally starting to rebuild the 40 horse for my '64 standard. 

Close examination shows the rods are 311 series, not 113, while the cylinder
bores in the case have been opened up to accept 90mm OD cylinders. I can't
find a part number on the crankshaft, but I presume its not stock as well,
nyplace special to look for the part number?

I'm unhappy. This is the original -numbers match- engine for the '64, but
its been turned into a bastard of sorts. I presume this will turn it into a
1600 or so. Is this a mistake? its obviously been rebuilt oncelike this, and
it also threw a rod!

Does anyone know the proper cylinder/piston kit size to order to fit a 90mm
OD? Other ideas?

Thanks
