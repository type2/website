&gt; Anyone in the Phoenix area leaving Friday for BBB?  Early to mid
morningish maybe?  Does anyone know how long it takes to get there for that
matter?  I'm guessing about 4 hours, maybe a lil less with the 2016, but we
dont mind slow.

I'm leaving Friday morning in the Westfailure. It is a solid 4 hours. I have
made it in just under 3, but that was leaving Phoenix at 2:00 in the
afternoon in July with the 6700 cc and dihydrogen monoxide cooling, . Only
little old me wanted to go, imagine that. Ran 80 and made good time, too,
but the more people you put in splitties, the less the collective bladder
holds. It is conceivable that if I filled the Westfailure to capacity with
warm bodies, we wouldn't drive more than 10 feet at a stretch between piddle
stops. Alas, this will not be the year for testing this theory. It is once
again my intention to buy the best campsite trophy by plying elegible voters
with liquor, however this year stricter attention will have to be paid to
see that the votes are actually cast. Last year we drank 5 bottles of
Tequila and a keg of Fat Tire in my carpeted campsite and I only received 6
votes. Clearly more than 5 other people were accomplices. I have recently
seen the high tech shower equipped bus that whooped me last year and if he
actually has water in it this year I am in for a horserace. Y'all bring
plenty of aspirin now. See you in a couple of weeks.
