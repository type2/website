Subject: Re: [VB] Re: '65 vs. '66/'67 wiper shaft

hm the link did not work for me.

and FWIW, the 65 assembly is different than the 66/67

different frame/linkage /motor shape/pivots, etc.

66&amp;67 are teh same as each other except the voltage changed.

remember to grease all the moving parts in your wiper assembly, even wher eteh pivot goes through the tube, for longer lasting quiet wiper life.  grease grease grease grease

so you have both pivots broken on your 65 ?  

I think the length from center to bumper where the linkage attaches is a different length.

.....  Some of the parts (like the frame) are common to the
&gt; '65 and '66-'67 assemblies, but others (like the wiper shafts) aren't.
&gt; If you have a crusty '65 assembly, this might tell you what 
&gt; you need to
&gt; save from it to make a '66-'67 work.
