Subject: airs help

I just got a call from dan &amp; keith...they are in portland maine, and are
getting towed down to my house. he is having problems with his clutch, bad
noises when he pushes it in...leaking oil out the front. He thinks the front
engine seal is leaking oil...it sounds to me like a bad throw out
bearing...hopefully we can pull the engine-put a new bearing, seal and
clutch in...and get him on his way...

-Kevin
