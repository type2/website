I just recieved a catalog showing hidden antennas, there is a mat antenna
that you could glue to your top under the headliner, also a split amplified
anenna that could go on the parcel tray or under the headliner and a couple
other amplified antenna, these seem that they would work great on a bus if
you didn't have holes drilled, or didn't want to drill holes in your bus,
prices range from 20 to 75 dollars depending on what style, I could get
these or any GOOD auto stereo shop should have these in stock or be able to
get them.
