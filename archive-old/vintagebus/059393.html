Subject: Re: [VB] brake questions

Pete,
also make sure all of the adjuster tabs on the backing plates (hope that des=
cription works) are intact  From experience I have seen the adjusters back o=
ff from the tabs being too far bent up or broken off.

I just recently had to fab some for my 63, from some banding strap.  Check t=
he archives and you should find some info to help.

&gt; Hi List,
&gt; My 63 crew cab is having some breaking problems. It
&gt; keeps &quot;gaining&quot; pedal. I've replaced the master
&gt; cylinder, brake hoses, and wheel cylinders on one
&gt; wheel that was obviously leaking. The other wheel
&gt; cylinders seem fine. Has anyone had this problem and
&gt; if so, can anyone tell me what the heck else I can
&gt; look for?

&gt; Thanks,
