Hey
Speaking of fresh air hoses, I saw a great alternative to the aluminum/paper 
tubes that we use these days. I was at the Real Source show in Effingham, IL 
over the weekend and saw a bug w/ steel tubes that ran from the shroud to the 
heater boxes and were totally functional. I asked the guy how he did it and 
he told me he put his complete engine in the back of his truck, went to 
Meineke (sp?) and an hour later they did this custom tubing for him. He then 
had it chromed. As I was talking to him the head honcho of the real source 
came over and was asking him about allowing them to mass produce these for 
consumers.

While I had the chance I asked The Real Source guy why they don't stock any 
bus parts and why the show was called Beetle funfest? He said there is no 
market for the busses or parts for them(even though half of the winners of 
the show were busses). I 'bout lost it laughing so hard...

Some people-
