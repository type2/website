Subject: Missing Crew additional info


Randy, the guy that had his crew stolen mailed me with some additional
identifying features of his truck incase it has been painted.   The list
follows.

  &quot;Identifying features: The rear seat support had been louvered; it has
a shifter lock; it has 1 blue halogen headlight (I replaced one with a
standard sealed beam); there is an equalizer hole cut into the dash next
to the radio. Thank you for your help.

Sincerely, ~Randawg.Randy Moore (randawg72_at_hotmail_dot_com)714-521-5545. &quot;

S.
