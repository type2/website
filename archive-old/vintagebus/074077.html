Subject: Buses in the Shop 3 (07.19.03)

That's right, folks...you heard it here first.  July 19, 2003 is Buses in 
the Shop 3 over at VolksAuthority in San Jose, CA!  It's a Saturday and 
we'll be there from 8am-1pm.  This is basically a Swap N Shine...not quite 
a Show N Shine, since we don't have awards or judging or anything.  What we 
do have is just a cool, laid-back day of buses, friends, and 
raffle.  There's also no sales tax on purchases at VolksAuthority for that 
day only!  Swappers....since this event takes place in a neighborhood, we 
ask that you limit your swap area to either within or immediately around 
your bus.  This event is free for everyone!

&quot;Listen to the motor. Listen to the wheels. Listen with your ears and with 
your hands on the steering wheel; listen with the palm of your hand on the 
gear-shift lever; listen with your feet on the floor boards. Listen to the 
pounding old jalopy with all your senses; for a change of tone, a variation 
of rhythm...&quot; - John Steinbeck _The Grapes of Wrath_
