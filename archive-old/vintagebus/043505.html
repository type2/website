&gt;#4--brand new case,, It has been machined for bigger jugs,,  I usually
&gt;have my used cases professionally cleaned but have been told I can clean
&gt;it myself.  What cleaning fluids have you guys had good luck with ?

When I took the aluminum (alloy?) oil pan off my F_at_rd, the &quot;wheel
cleaner&quot; chemical at the local do-it-yourself car wash did a pretty
good job on the oil and gunk in it.  I think part of it was the 
chemical and part of it was the high pressure.  Note that if you
want to try this, you might want to bring a couple of bricks or
rocks - the pressure coming out of the pipe was enough to scoot
my oil pan around on the ground!  You probably don't want any of
the machined surfaces (like the mating flange) on your new case
to be dragging around on the concrete.  (Trivia: Did you know that
the holes in the drain grate are typically bigger than your oil
pan plug?  Did you know that the pits under the drain grate are
DEEP?  :) )
 
Dish soap and water does work well on small parts, but you have to
scrub it to get heavy gunk off.  Something like steel wool is good
for non-machined surfaces; you might try one of those plastic dish
scrubbers, or one of those &quot;Scotch-brite&quot; sponges with the green
scrubby side for the machined surfaces.

On a related note, if you need to clean a machined mating or gasket
surface, look for a plastic putty knife at your hardware store.
One of these and a little solvent does a nice job, and the plastic
will give way before it scratches the metal.  Test the solvent
first to make sure it won't eat the putty knife...I used generic
brake cleaner.

&gt;#5-- do they really run better if you wear a stocking hat during assembly

Haven't heard about this.  I'm kind of partial to the idea of setting
up a small shrine to Porsche, Pon, and Muir in the garage while you're
assembling... :)
