Subject: RE: [VB] Insulation/sound deadening

&gt;Anyone have suggestions on &quot;insulation&quot; for sound deadening?  Is it wort=
h
doing?  This was on a singlecab at Jerome last year.they claim that the
singlecab is so quiet that they cannot hear the engine running.
&gt;
Not for nothing but every *stock* Single and Double Cab I have ridden in,=

you could not hear the engine at idle and barely hear it at highway speed=
s.
 Wind noise drowned it out.

You can barely hear the engine running at idle in my my '55 Kombi (stock
36hp) but at highway speeds, it's ear plug time.

I installed some McMaster-Carr sheets behind my rear seat, it did not app=
ear
to do much, if anything.  I was considering slapping on another layer. 
Or maybe I just need one of them fancy Buses with a headliner and cargo
area panels.  ;)
