Or you can get a T fitting and run the guage sender and the regular sender as 
well.

&lt;&lt; There are two VDO pressure senders, a two and a one 
 terminal. The two terminal sender has an on/off 
 connection and an analog for the guage. Nope, you can't 
 hook the idiot light to the guage. Get the correct type 
 if you want the idiot light to work. I recommend it.

 &gt; My gauges and senders came in today. The oil pressure sender only has 
 &gt; one terminal on it and I though it would have two:one for the VDO 
 &gt; gauge and one for the stock idiot light. Can I hook both up to the 
 &gt; same terminal or will that mess everything up?
