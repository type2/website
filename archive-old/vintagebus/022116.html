&gt;What is this?

&gt;&gt;023 are you sure this is not A23, B23, C23, or D23?
&gt;&gt;    should be a designation for SO-23 Westfalia camper interior.

It is the SO-23 Westfalia camper kit.  There were variations, such as 
with or without hatch, with or without optional ice box, with or without 
tent, and with or without Westfalia roof rack.

They designated the combinations as A23, B23, C23, &amp; D23.

PS, if you remove the passenger side headlight bucket, you should see 
    SK 654C written there in grease pencil to remind them on the assembly 
    line to paint the upper half of the bus.  Kombis normally were not 
    painted 2-tone.

PPS, if you look at the plate in the engine compartment, there will be a 
    plate with 23-23 on one line, that designates a Kombi (model 23) with 
    a SO-23 Westy interior.
