Subject: RE: [VB] Back in a bus after 30 years!

'Quite an adventure, a noisy and sometimes hot trip, but much more
memorable than the same trip would have been in a modern fuel-injected
speedy quiet air-conditioned Japanese sedan, don't you think?'

Richard,
Thanks so much for sharing your adventure with the list.  I know exactly
what you mean about the traveling part, my 8year old son and I had an
awesome 600 mile round trip this past winter in my '66 Deluxe....of course
winter in Texas meant we left home at 29 degrees and got back 4 days later
and it was over 80.  Thanks again for the trip report.
