s- you want a canadian title, or keep it reg in Ca.  If the reg is current, no
tri permit neccessary.   I don't know if a ca trip permit will work, I drove
my truck from ca through Or into Wa with a ca trip permit.  Ask the canadian
customs folks.   A WA trip permit costs $10, I am sur eyou could get one
through the mail.
