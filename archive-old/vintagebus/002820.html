Subject: Gen Brushes help needed Part II

Before I go out and replace my Generator, I need some list
advice/wisdom...please

I removed old brushes on my 1600 after red light came on.  Light would dim
as rpm increased, so I figured I'd start at the Generator.  Both brushes
were way below top of holder, down to 1/2 inch. No sparks even when I
pressed on them.  Local Flaps sold me a new set for $9 and they looked big,
but correct, and were 1&quot; long, so I installed them, cleaning commuter bright
and shiney along the way.  Start Bus, red light still on, this time gets
BRIGHTER as rpm increases.  Brushes made a high pitched whine at first, so I
figured they were just getting broken in.  Looked in, and there were sparks.
Drove around the block, and at one point, red light went out, and was just
flickering.  Back in driveway.  Red light bright again.  No whine anymore,
but commuter is all streaked black again.  Did the tests from muir and
Bently with a voltmeter, and with regulator disconected, found generator is
putting out 1/2 Volt at 1000 rpm.  Cleaned and shined commutor again, but no
difference.  Red light bright, and now no change at any rpm, and no sparks
when I push on the brushes.  My motor is not running any hotter than normal,
and my fan belt is not shiney and has max 1/2&quot; of play to each side starting
at center.

To me I either got the wrong brushes, or my generator is shot.  I guess
maybe I should order the correct brushes from someone who knows what they
are doing, and retry.  Any other suggestions?  Luckily I have a ride to work
for at least two days.

Thanks.
Don
