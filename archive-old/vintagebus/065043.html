Subject: Late ('70) Louved Window Q

I guess after 22 years of trusty service, or as Murphy
would have it, the passenger side camping window in my
'70 broke. Is it possible to just replace the small
crank mechanism that it riveted to the window or do I
need to replace the whole window? Anyone have the
parts?
