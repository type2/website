Was writ:
I'd really like any info I can get as to how to go about makeing my door
locks work with my ignition key.

Sunday at Kelley Park I had Gabriel cut me a key and replace the spring for
my single cab.  He brings his blanks and equipment to the NorCal shows, and
can cut spares, make your locks 'one key,' or as I did, give him a handle and
say &quot;I need a key for this&quot; I understand he does mail service so you can send
your handles in and he can fix them up for ya.

Hope this helps
