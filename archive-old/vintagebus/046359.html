Haha!  That always sucks!  Someone primed over the 57s og paint. been trying 
to get it off just so i can find out what kind of damage there is under 
there.  In the mean time though, I am screwing the paint up which otherwise 
would have been somewhat decent.  I would rather try to blend the color than 
to just spray bomb the whole thing.  Thats what im doing to my 67 right now.  
PPG L87 in rattle cans, spraying over the primer and trying to blend as best 
as I can. 

I have seen tons of busses here in town where the kid says hes gettin a paint 
job, primers the whole thing and drives with it like that for months or 
years.  You think it's wise to drive with the primer before you paint it? 
Won't it just kinda defeat the purpose of applying the primer?  From what I 
recall bug guts, oils, dirt and all that arent good to paint over :) 

Its their bus and if they like it and are having fun, then best wishes!  

jerome! jerome! jerome! ahhhh! cant wait!
