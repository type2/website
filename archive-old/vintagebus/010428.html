well i just thought id let everybody know, that as of June 1 , 2000 every
vehicle on the road in alabama is required to have insurance. The fine is
$500 and $100 to reinstate your tag if caught without it. And im a
longhaired hippie with a beard in a bus soo, I say goodbye with a tear in my
headlight assembly to 10 wonderfull years of insurance and accident free vw
driving. Tommorow is the last day of freedom and i will have to spend it
standing in line at the insurance company. And i have to add an additional
$25 a month to my vw costs, which comes out of the parts budget,       :-(.
