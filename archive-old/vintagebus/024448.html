If your fingers won't do the job, get a couple of super-cheap junky
screwdrivers and round their blades nice and smooth, and very dull.
You want no sharp edges to tear the rubber.  One pretty small and one
a bit larger is good.  Push the lip closer to the metal thru the hole
and work things around.  With a split grommet, if you can get one end
of it in place you can sort of 'screw' the rest in.  Fingers and some
rubber lube usually do it for my cars.
