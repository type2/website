&gt; Would this be a reason to move to a 009 Dizzy? Also, I'm going to be

Hi Daniel,
The 009 will not get you any more speed unless your present distributor is 
bad.  Take off the distributor cap on what you have now and try turning the 
rotor one way and the other.  It should move aways in one direction and 
spring back if the advance system is not rusted up.  If you have a vacuum 
advance you need to pull off the hose from the distributor at the carb and 
suck on the hose end to see if the distributor innereds advance with the 
rotor off.  No advance and the first check worked means a bad vacuum advance 
can.
We had the same top speed problem with our 1960 panel camper conversion 
shortly after we had got it from the DPO and we installed a newly rebuilt big 
bore 40 HP engine.  Turned out that 3,000 RPM in fourth gear was only 35 MPH 
(Even with the stock 1960-63 tranny gearing this was only 47MPH and we were 
barely able to do 58 MPH pedal to the floor.) and we were just able to get up 
to 4,000 RPM at 45 MPH and no faster!!!!!  Which is the reason this bus came 
with a 1600 DP in the cargo area with a hole through the top of the engine 
case from a thrown connecting rod.  So you need to beg, borrow, or buy a tach 
and wire it up for at least a fifteen minute drive.  With a passenger holding 
the tach have him/her write down where 1,500 and 3,000 RPMs are MPHwise in 
each forward gear.  Never go below 1,500 RPM except for short periods in 
first and reverse.  Only go above a cruising 3,000 RPM for short periods to 
prevent dropping below 1,500 (Especially when going uphill and/or heavily 
loaded.) when upshifting.  The engine will last twice as long and you will 
get a really good MPG return.
