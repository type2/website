So true.  Plus you have to realize the relatively small market vs the start up
costs and total return on investment.  Thats why they call it a &quot;business&quot;.
But since you're willing to jump in with both feet, go for it.

&gt;
&gt; Because bus people are cheap. Or thrifty, whatever. I built an SO-35
&gt; recently and it would cost you $2000 to have me build another. Most people
&gt; don't want to pay that for a bus, much less a couple of cabinets for it. 8^)
