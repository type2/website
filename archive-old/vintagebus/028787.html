Subject: wheel cylinder rebuild kits

I got my wheel cylinder rebuild kits in the mail today from BFY Obsolete
Parts.  Good packing job! :)
The fronts were 4.50 a piece...but the rears were 10.00 a piece.
yes...you can buy a new rear cylinder for that price I know... and I
already did.  I didn't think they would be that much...I shoulda
asked...good thing I only got 2....
I got 6 for the fronts so I can do all of them...and still have 2 spares
for later...or someone else.
The fronts are made by Varga and have the dust boot, and another little
0 shaped seal in them...and the rears are made by ATE and come in a nice
little box with 2 dust boots, 2 other seals, and instructions for
rebuilding even!  Made in the UK.  Vargas are made in Brazil...
We'll see how the rebuilds go.
I have about 500 miles on the 62 by the way...  I'm having a blast with
the thing.  I drove it from Oshkosh to Shawano to see my grandma...and
then to Green Bay to see some other relatives....they got a kick out of
it.  I've been driving 55-60 the whole time...more along the lines of
55...and slower at night when there is no traffic :)
Ever hear of a 16 year old driving under the speed limit?  ;-)
