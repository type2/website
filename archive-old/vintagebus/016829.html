Subject: aftermarket oil fillers
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

i just picked up an aftermarket oil filler from a
friend of mine. it's about 4-5 inches long and it's
billet aluminum. does anyone have any information on
these? who makes them? they apparently don't leak as
much as stock oil fillers.
