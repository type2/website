&lt;&lt; ok..I just was looking at my '57 kombi's overhead vent system and 
 notice just after the switch from side to rear air flow there are 5 ribs
 going lengthways in the sheet mete.this looked wierd to me so I 
 compared it to my 58 deluxe and 58 panel and they are both 
 different,but the same as my '63 15 win.,'65 std., '67 westy and '59 
 panel..they have jusy one huge rounded recess.what gives?is this a
 57 and earlier thing..must be.

hey Cameron, do you have a pic?  I am not sure where on the bus you are 
talking about.   this is on the horizontal area over you head to the rear of 
the side/back vent direction knob?
