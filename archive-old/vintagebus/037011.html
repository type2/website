Subject: clutch problems I think
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Today I was driving the BeerWagen home from the VW club meeting. Went down 
the freeway a couple of miles, everything was fine until I got off and 
stopped. I went to shift into first... nothing, like I wasn't even pushing in 
on the clutch. Couldn't even force it, no grinding, nothing would not go into 
any gears. I let off the clutch and jambed it in gear with a grind, but it 
went in. Tried to take off but it was like the back wheels were locked up. It 
really did not want to move. Then the engine stalled. I restarted and popped 
the clutch and kind of bounced into the nearest parking lot. Once in the lot, 
got out and did a visual inspection, everything was still connected and in 
place. I sat there for a second, tried first again and .....  perfect. Went 
into all the gears and drove perfect all the way home. Any ideas on what this 
could be? I plan on pulling the motor this weekend to replace the 
clutch/pp/TObearing anyway. Is there anything I should look for while I'm in 
there?
Thanks,
Brian
