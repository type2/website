I will be driving a U-Haul truck from the LA area to Phoenix on Monday, July
3rd.  It will be about 50% empty except for some ridiculously heavy stuff.

If you bring the stuff to me in Whittier, CA, I will haul it to Phoenix
where you or someone else can pick it up at my crib.

Deliveries to my in-laws pad in Whittier could be made on Saturday or
Sunday.  BTW, their house is for sale, like $275k or so, nice place, come
check it out if you're in the market.  ;)

If anybody feels like letting a Binz Double Cab leave their property, let me
know, I'll bring some money and reserve a trailer too.
