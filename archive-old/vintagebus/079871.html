Subject: 12 volt flasher on 65 bus

Hi All-
 
I am putting together a 65 bus that will be running 12 volt. One of the items that I need to make 12 volt is the flasher (unless someone came come up with a better idea).
 
Had a look at the WW web site and came up with 211953227BGR being the closest match. $125 to make my lights go blinky blinky is a bit over the top for my tastes. Surely there must be a better way to do this.
 
I should mention that I have a new wiring harness so don't wanna start hacking into it- nor do i wanna start drilling holes in the bus to make itfit. Would rather use the stock mounting place next to the fuse box.
 
Please pmail me as I am reading in digest mode. 
 
With any luck another bus should soon be on the road in Ontario.
