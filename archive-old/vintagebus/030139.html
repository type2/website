Subject: Update &amp; help (65 Samba restoration)

Well,  i thought i was making some good progress on the bus.  The
interior is comming along very nicely.  Almost done.  I have a few parts
to track down but mostly i am waiting for some seat welting to finish
the top of the door panels.  I did get the carpet for the luggage area
but do not have the padding for below it yet.

I think i have the electrical done.  Well, all but the engind stuff.  I
did have some trouble with the turn signal that i think i have solved
but am not certain.  The dash light likes to stay on when the ignition
is off for some reason.

The big problem right now is the Engine.  New case and all and it
leaks.  Arggg!!!  I put the engine in the bus on Friday and put some oil
in it.  About a half hour later i had drip's from the case half seam
along the entire bottom.  What's up with that.  It is a new case, i used
&quot;Gaskasinch&quot; sealer on both halfs and torqed the case properly.  Only
thing i can figure is i did not do a final wip on the case surface after
i had cleaned them.  Any ideas here?  I am currently taking it apart to
try and find the problem.  I hope i find a piece of dirt in there.
Otherwise i will give it another go.  Other then that, the engine has
been OK.  I did fight some little things but nothing major.

I hope to get the engine done in a week or so and put her back in.
Other then that, my list of to-do is short.

1.  Engine
2.  Finish door panels
3.  Get some safari glass and finish installing these.
4.  Put parcell tray and speedo cable in and clean up the wires.
(presentation)
5.  Steering wheel, horn install, front seat and sun visors
6.  Find the rest of the small stuff i am missing.

Almost there.  any suggestions where i could post some picts for all to
see.  I have lot's of them.

Thanks
Matt
