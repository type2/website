#()$&amp;_at_#($ paint &amp; body shop has had my '63 DoubleCab since last June!
Lightning Truck and Auto Paint, if you want a long-term storage place.
No complaints beside the delay, which I knew going in.  They did a
beautiful job in between their insurance meat &amp; potatoes. The work was
extensive, new rockers, floors, replaced the nose with a '67 clip, and
retained the '63 dash. It's a bright RAL2000, orange/yellow.

Question #1;  The harness pulled out and back had breaks and repairs
from an old nose crunch, so I'm replacing it with a WiringWorks harness.
Has anyone here done a full wiring replacement and are willing to send
me some tips &amp; tricks?

I know that the fuel sender is a little longer, and I'm ready to splice
that in. Bob at WW says my alternator isn't a problem either. A good
fish-tape is hanging in my garage, Bently at hand, I've got a good
crawler and a dry driveway. What's next?
