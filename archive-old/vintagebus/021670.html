Michael,
The Volker referred to is probably Volker Bruckman of Volker's German Car
Clinic. Volker is a factory trained Porsche mechanic who I believe still holds
an unlimited FIA racing license. He has placed highly at Daytona. He has build
racing motors for Porsche's and dune buggies with considerable success. He is
definitely opinionated about what works for specific application which is not
always taken well by those with other opinions. He has racing credentials to
support his opinions.
His shop can be reached at 619-448-6216, and is in Santee California at 7953
Mission Gorge Rd Santee CA 92071

vvvince
67 Westy, and an acquaintance of Volker
