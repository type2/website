&gt;when you puttin it up?? gimme gimme :)

Ok all...here's the info out of a book I have called Volkswagen 
Transporter Options and Coachwork Variations (1967 &amp; earlier) It was 
reprinted by the Thing/Type 181 Registry and I received it as a 
present from the afforementioned Tom Stone.

All I have up is text, but I'll scan pix asap. The only problem is 
that this is not a very good copy, so the pix are not very good. The 
other problem is that the book is in German! So I typed it all in and 
took the page over to BabelFish and had it translated. Then I cleaned 
it up a bit to make it actually sound like English. This is still a 
rough first draft, though. There are a couple of words that didn't 
translate. It kept using the word &quot;soil&quot; for what I determined to be 
&quot;surface&quot;.

Anyway, just to show off, I'm giving you the link to the German 
version so you can see what kind of work this is! Keep in mind I 
don't speak a word of it beyond &quot;People's Car&quot; and &quot;Firing Order&quot;. :)

I am going to be adding all of the pages in the book to our site this 
way, I am also doing the same thing to a 1967 original parts book. It 
will be fully searchable and will load as fast as you can think! I'll 
post that URL when it's in progress.
