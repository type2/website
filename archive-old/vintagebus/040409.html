Subject: Trailer Hitch Picture

Several people have asked how my new trailer hitch looks once installed.
While I do not have pictures of one on a bus (since I just got them in), I
do have a picture of one installed on a customer's Vanagon.  The bus hitch
basically installs and looks the same way. As you can see, all is concealed
by the bumper except for the tow ball and the vertical plate that it mounts
to. (Note: the metal visible below the bumper is this picture is the rear
apron of the van, not the hitch.)

Again, it's $161.50 with listmember discount; part numbers PVW7, PVW9, and
PVW15 for '68-71, '72, and '73-79 respectively.

Thanks,
