Hi Aaron,
Do you have the thermostatic bellows system installed and working?  VW engine 
warm up best by driving slowly (1,500-2,000 RPM only going above this to 
shift up.) for the first couple of minutes.  Warming the engine just sitting 
idling is like you sitting in the snow near naked.  Best to get up on your 
feet and start walking to get warmed up!
