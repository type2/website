&gt; I decided to go with dual carbs after my second trip to southern

&gt; extra H.P im looking for

Hi Kombi58,
If you are really looking for better hill climbing you need more torque which 
will be better produced with more stroke than anything else.  So you need to 
invest in a stroker crank preferably CW and not one that is welded and 
reground for more stroke.  With the bus these welded for more stroke cranks tend to 
shear off the welded on new steel on the journals and make a real mess of the 
engine.
  Or you could go with a type 4 engine with its stroke that is longer than 
the 1600 69mm stroke.
