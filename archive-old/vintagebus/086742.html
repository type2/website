Subject: 59 SC pulled from junkyard

I've known about this 59 sc for 10 years now and have just been able to  pull 
it from the junk yard where its been since the early 80's. Its about 90%  
complete including the bumper and gates but with rust in front floor and dog  
legs, the battery tray is intact along with very solid frame and treasure  
compartment floor. 
The bed has two fist size holes and the gates are very savable along with  
both treasure doors.  I have 2 59 parts vans that I'm going to use parts  from 
to improve the SC. 
 
I'm sure the paint is all original. its a shame that I will have to replace  
the passenger door.
 
Not sure what I'm going to do with it yet, It would make a great shop truck  
but I would sell it if someone wanted to restore it.
