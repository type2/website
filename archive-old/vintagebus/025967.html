not to start any threads or fights..but I'd like to clear my name.
All of you who have talked to me know that I am not the type of person to just
say &quot;screw you&quot;
This is my first split and it is near me and affordable to MY budget.  I really
don't have that much money and this is pushing what I can afford.  like I said
before I would be selling some of the spare parts to finance it. ie rubber,
nuts bolts, purchase price etc.
I'm willing to help anyone out anyway i can...anyone who has done business with
me or knows me can verify this.
I'm not just some punk kid with a bus who doesn't know what he's doing. Maybe I
was before..but this is no longer the case.  I even take care of my bay and
have made her a daily driver.

I'm not trying to steal anyones bus here. I didn't know all this was set up..I
did know you were INTERESTED though..nothing else.  so I pounced on the deal as
it is very near by.  I have had some VERY attractive offers ..ie 67 westy in
maine for a good price...but can not get out to maine or even travel anywhere
for this.

I just wanted to clear things up.
Please don't publicly insult me.  In my book, THAT is bad karma.

anyways...how far away are you? there are PLENTY of buses in between here and
there I'm sure.  just look.  I had to.

now he tries to be all nice to me in an email
now I say screw him.

thanks all
Isaiah

direct any flames to me! not the list.  I wouldn't have done this...but I don't
need my name darkended by one person.

I have corresponded via p-mail with Issaiah and he has pretty much said i

&gt; dont care if you had a deal.  Its near me and i want it so screw you.
&gt;
&gt; I have even offered a compromise where we could split the price and i get
&gt; some of the parts and he gets the bus, he has pretty much said no way.  He
&gt; will take what he wants and if anything's left over i can get that from
&gt; him later.
&gt;
&gt; I guess if isaiah wants his first bus purchase to be full of bad karma
&gt; thats his deal, but im sure his bus ownership will be tainted by its
&gt; beginnings.
&gt;
&gt; I'm really not sure what to do about this whole situation, but it really
&gt; leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
