Check out rubber supply stores.  Any decent sized town will have one.
Industrial rubber like O rings for hydraulics, fire hoses, and such.

There is a superglue made for rubber I've used for creating a turntable
drive belt out of a chunk of round rubber stock.

Be careful of GOOP, I have been burned a couple of times buying a tube
that had been on the shelf too long and was worthless.

The two part stuff sounds good.  I'd be tempted to glue on a fabric
support also.

Ask the rubber people what to use to clean it with.  Gotta be clean
for anything to work well.

As I have my barndoors floor mat out and it is unlikely I can find a decent
replacement, and it is old and torn,  anyone ever happily repair one?   I
hate moving it around.  The glycerin really does help soften it up, much
better than yesterday it is, but that does not heal rips.  That black rubber
cement?  superglue?  Anyone done this?
