What's ironic, is one of the reasons I never go to any of the away shows is
that I'm always working on something *here*, and I turn into somewhat of a
workaholic when I get into one of these projects.

For instance, I have spent every night and weekend for the last 3 weeks
working on the '60 panel.

Maybe for one of the shows I can get some to drive one of the buses, and
take *both* of them down there!

&gt; So when are you going to make a real road trip to So Cal or Az.? Something
&gt;like 1000/1500 miles at least round trip. Would love to see your blue 55
&gt;sometime, but will have to wait till I  come to Kelly park in April I guess
&gt;on my 1200 mile round trip, primer paint and all. No flames please, just
&gt;trying to get Thom and his great 55 westy out of his area so we can see it.
