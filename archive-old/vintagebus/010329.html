I've written about these sliders several times in recent years.

This is the URL for an article in the Type 2 Library:
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/camper/sliders.htm

And this is the URL for a post in the Archives:
http://216.166.222.133/archive/type2/015881.html

Besides Boater's World, West Marine and Camping World [along with most other
marine and RV stores] carry the RECMAR line of curtain hardware.

If you're searching an online catalog, search for RECMAR.  That often works
when other searches fail.

FWIW.....
