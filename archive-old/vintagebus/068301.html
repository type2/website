Subject: Re: [VB] Can you tell from the pics?

&gt; Looks like a 70-71  to me. Square reflectors, no disc brakes and I doubt its a Westy. The windows on a Westy have 3 panes.

I think that may be a Sportsmobile window.

*	We like to enjoy the good things in life.
*	We are in favor of activities which don't cost much.
*	We prefer to camp outside of campings,even if it's not too legal.
*	We don't bother much about keeping our West's as neet or closer as
        possible to the original look of a Westfalias, we prefer the
        utility and the personnality of the vehicule.
*	We try to repair ourselves our Wests.
