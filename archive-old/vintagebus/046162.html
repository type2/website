&gt;  Anyway I was thinking a rack would allow me to get some of the stuff out of
&gt;  the bus and on top of it. I can't really afford to buy a nice westie rack 
so
&gt;  I was wondering if anyone local either would be willing to loan / rent me
&gt;  one for the week, has a beater they will sell for cheap or if someone has a
&gt;  set of Yakima rack legs that fit a bus that they would be willing to sell
&gt;  me?
&gt;  Anyone???

&quot;It has to have a Hat&quot;  -   you never know when you might need a roof rack. 

Some people want a roof rack as a fashion accessory.  It has to be pretty and 
shiny.  Bah humbug.  I would not want one of those wood slat racks- I'd 
thrash it.    I had a 7 ft dern sturdy rack for sale cheap for quite a while, 
hauled it to local shows and back a few times, gone now.  It was ugly.  U,   
G,   L,   Y, you aint got no alibi,  UGLY!  had been broken and welded to fix 
it at some of the cross pieces for the legs.  no paint, no pretty 
galvanising, surface rust. but it was FUNctional.   having that rack FS at a 
show taught me that most people only want a pretty rack.  wow.  I did not 
know that.

cant you go get some of those bars that go from rain gutter to rain gutter- 
they are specifically VW I dont think, for whatever vehicle- dont they adjust 
to fit?   Maybe you can buy them at Schmuck's  for $20 or something.   Tie 
the extra stuff to those.If you want the 'rack' to be longer, attach some 
2x4s length wise. those tie down straps are 2 for a buck at the dollar store. 

  Tom in Yakima (Deer Park?) makes good roof racks, and he is always at the 
Seattle area shows.  Real nice guy, drives a SGR/BG 15 window.

Vintage Meet in Seattle will be Saturday, July 14th, at Shoreline Community 
College.  only $5 to show your car.   (shameless plug)
