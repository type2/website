&gt; Westfalia's don't necesarily follow that rule. I have a '65 Westfalia that has a white (silver beige) wheel and column. I know that this is how my bus came and I have seen a few others that are also like that. I'm not sure, but it may have to do with the color of the bus and or year of manufacture. I &quot;think&quot; most of the ones I have seen with the white color are Dove Blue.
&gt; The steering wheel horn buttons are a little more difficult to find as they are white with no wolfsburg center.

I have a '65(pop-top)and a '67(hard top) both pearl white (L87) and they
both have the white wheel and column.  FWIW.
