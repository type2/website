OK guys being friday.  Last week someone brought up antenna location and it 
veered off into antenna balls.  Here is a web site where one can purchase 
all types of these great little accessories, http://www.happyballs_dot_com/

another site called www.antennaballs_dot_com make$ them, and can make a cu$tom 
antenna ball for your business or organization.  How about a bus antenna 
ball, heck I'd buy one and it'd be a great way to accessorize your bus and 
show your support for the list.  Since were talking fund raising and all.
