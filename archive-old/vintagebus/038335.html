The PO had a few of pieces of 1/2 inch x 3/4 inch seal 
cut from the seal that goes around the cargo doors installed
to keep it from crashing.  I was going to use closed cell foam
of the same dimensions found at most hardware stores,
until I ran across a used seal in good servicable shape
at a wrecking yard for $3.  It only broke in one spot
when I removed it.  Saved a hundred dollars for more
important and safety related things, like brakes.

After installing the correct shape seal, I think that the
1/2 x 3/4 seal would work in most areas, worth the
few bucks to try, assuming one isn't a perfectionist.
Do test with a water hose prior to using nature's rain
as a test, however.

Also, the seal for the rear hatch is REALY EXPENSIVE! Does nayone know if
there is a good substitute available in a hardware store or something?

I just installed a brand new rear hatch seal from West Coast Metric in
my 67 westy and it is flawless.  I know that they are expensive but in
the long run you will be much happier.
