Subject: 21 window found needs love


Hey like i said i just picked up this 77 van, its solid, but looks like
garbage, anyway the purpose of this message is to say that there is a
early 60's (?) 21 window sunroof model van at the same junk place i found
this one, i took a few pics of it because i love the vans, but its a bit
more work than i can handle right now....

www.tbmarket_dot_com/hunt

lets see in summary, its surface rusted in a lot of places
glass is all intact and solid
doors dont sag
it has the double open out side doors
the bottom inch of the side doors are rusted out
the floor where the above mentioned doors sit is rusted.
driver seat floorboard needs cut and rewelded.
hole in bottom edge behind driver door by front tire
engine looks clean and complete
sunroof fabric is missing, frame and bows are intact
all dash items are present, sapphire I radio, ashtray, ciglighter, knobs,
etc.  
steering wheel has a white cover over it so i imagine it needs restored.

guy is asking 650, you haul it off, and it doesnt have a title.

He also has a matching pair of squarebacks, 200 per, both automatics, both
pretty sold, easy restores, one lookslike it has burned so its maybe a
better parts car

oh and this guy is near scottsburg indiana

anyone wants a name and number or directions, give me a holler
it needs a good home, and my 6 vehicles is my limit
