In a message dated 98-11-23 12:33:22 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; On another note, there is a wire coming off of the regulator (the same pole
 as the battery connection I believe) that has an inline fuse (looks like 8
 amps) that appears to be a factory item, but is not shown on the wiring
 diagram (either Bentley's or Thoms).  The wire runs behind the engine and
 disappears above the wheel well on the left side of the bus going forward.
 Is this a Westy unique installation, and does anybody know what it does?
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Dave,
If you mean forward and not the behind the engine you are stating (Remember
forward means toward the front bumper!).  Then that is the westie wire for the
interior lights.  Earlier buses had this wire going to the right side of the
engine and went to a european cigar lighter socket.  Eric &amp; Barb
