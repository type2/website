Subject: 6V headlight specs?
Date: Mon, 01 May 2000 09:49:03 -0600
Sender: dworkin_at_village_dot_org


What are the actual wattage specs for the 6V headlights (say, in
1960)?  I think I've tracked my flaky blinkers down to not working
when the headlights are on, but the headlights don't seem dim.
Therefore, I suspect the bulbs themselves are pulling too much power
(although I'm going to clean up all the connections in any case).
Thus, I'd like to inspect the existing bulbs and make sure they're the
right ones.

Thanks.
