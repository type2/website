If I had $1750 right now it'd be mine!
One owner, bought new in '67, the guy is ooooold and rolled it.
It runs drives fine but the roof and drivers side are messed up.
It is 100% original.
Push button window sqirter, jail bars, pop outs, perfect interior with all
the chrome handles working clock deluxe outer trim nice bumbers with trim
and rocker deluxe trim original motor and air cleaner and governor and no
cut out apron with correct muffler and nice original floor mats fold down
middle seat 1/3 2/3 front seats chrome ashtray front and rear.
The nose has a bit of a dent at the bumper line but is unrusted.
Driver door lowere hinge is rusty/loose and dog leg is rusty.
$1750 and I know where it is.
It's either going to end up at the puyallup swap meet this coming Sunday
or give Russ a call at 206-365-5872 in Seattle Washington.
It is light blue and white.
I wish I had some cash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
