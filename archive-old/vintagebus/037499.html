&lt;&lt; I've seen pictures of a 54 prototype binz!
 Supposedly they only made ONE!!!!!!
 Then again, my old 61 deluxe was registered as a 56......and my old 67 
beetle 
 was registered as a 55!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Have fun! &gt;&gt;

I posted a picture on vintagebus and vwplanet (I think) of a 1953 Binz from 
an original ad.  Production supposedly, according to said literature, began 
in '53.
