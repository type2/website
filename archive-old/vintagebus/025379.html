    I bought safaris from Izzy last July... they look great!! At least
they did till the glass cracked. I believe the problem has to do with
the tab that attaches the sliding adjuster to the frame being at the
wrong angle and causing the frame to twist and crack the glass. I called
Izzy about this and he said he hadn't had many other problems and
offered to ship me a whole new safari... Given I live in Canada I
figured this was more than generous.
    In my opinion his price ($379us?) was more than fair (They even came
with stainless steel install screws) He also has two kinds of glass
clear or with green tint to match original. BTW no affiliations etc...
just a happy customer.

Slight &quot;tweaking&quot; seems to have solved the cracking problem, the other
side is still fine.
