Subject: BBB 7 Vehicile Totals

 Someone was asking about numbers of buses at the show. Here is the breakdown
of types that registered:

Split Bus             106
Bay                      45
Vanagon               21
Eurovan                  3
Bug                      16
Square Back           3
Ghia                       1

These totals don't count any of the club members buses.

The club is donating $6,000 to Az. Children's Assoc, and $1,000 to the
Children's Enrichment Fund. All these funds stay in LHC.
Thanks to all of you that came and made the event the success that it was. A
special thanks to Jim Bell who spearheaded the event this year, see you Jan.
