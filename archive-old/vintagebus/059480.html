&gt;&gt;  Split busses are VERY RARE around here.

So since I posted this last week, I thought I'd share. Yesterday I 
went to the local shop to cut the torsion housing out of bay window 
headed to the scrap yard. And there sitting in one of the work bays 
was a 1966 beater camper. Man, I couldn't believe it. I talked to the 
shop owner and he said that it belongs to a real old man who drives 
it twice a year to take his dogs to the vet. He keeps it running, 
inspected, and registered just so he can do that! Anyway, yet another 
one that stays tucked in the garage. Funny thing is that &quot;I know 
about all the VW's in town&quot;.  Yeh...right! That's what I get for 
having the ego!
