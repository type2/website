&gt; Take my laptop out to the other car, plug it into the radio modem and I'm
on
&gt; the air connected to the network.  Without cellular, dial ups, isp's etc.
&gt; Just directly monitor the network and I'm connected.


NQ here - also known as KB0DMU.  I used to be into ham radio and ran quite a
successful operation of distributing a disk with radio modifications on it.
The packet stations used to be chock full of mail that requested radio
modifications.  I would reply to all of them and offer a disk of mods for a
buck and sent out probably 50 disks in the early 90's.  Some jerk of a ham
radio operator got on my case and threatened to filter my emails out because
I was generating too much traffic when in reality, I had decreased the
amount of weekly computer traffic by about 50 to 75.  I had proof!  When the
guy got nasty and threatened to filter my mail, I signed off and told him
that thanks to his stupidity, he had knocked a ham radio operator off the
air.  I logged off, disconnected my equipment, and sold every last big of
ham gear I had ever bought and have not only not regretted it but have never
looked back.

Anyway,  ham radio is pretty neat.  I know what Scott is going with his
locater and the work that goes on in order to have a web based tracker is
cool.  It takes brains but as Scott could testify, just about any of us here
could do the same thing.

The cool part is if you wanted to track the vehicle on the run, you bring a
laptop and cell modem along for the ride and you can watch where your bus
is!  If someone had it trailered, you better have the power to your locater
on all the time.
