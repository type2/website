&gt;So let's get to the point: What would you pack in your toolbox if it
&gt;were YOU making this trip???

I like what Dave Dixon said, using the Idiot manual checklist.  Some
specific things I would add are:

- The big socket and some big cotter pins for the rear axle nuts.
   Previous owners have been known to consider the cotter pins optional.

- Stuff you might need to work on the brakes.  If the brakes are not
   right, the bus shouldn't move.

- A box of metric nuts and bolts in the common sizes.

- Materials for improvised repairs, such as bailing wire, duct tape,
   light gauge angle iron, steel strap, pipe tape (flexible metal
   strip with holes in it).  This stuff might not make a repair that
   will last 2600 miles, but it might make a repair that allows you
   to get off of the side of the Interstate and under a nice shady
   tree.

In these modern times, taking lots of tools through the airport can
be highly entertaining.  At work, where we sometimes have to go to
a customer's site to install our product, we have had fairly good
luck with shipping most of the tools to the site via FedEx ground,
timed to arrive a day or two before the people arrive on the plane.
