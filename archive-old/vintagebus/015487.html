Former Countermans' Observations
Part One: Getting The Right Part.

Back in the early to mid 1990's, I worked at a very well known Volkswagen 
parts and accessories store in beautiful Southern California (I will 
withhold the name to protect the innocent).

When I first accepted the job, I thought I knew all there was to know about 
Volkswagens (I did impress my boss with the highest score ever on a 
knowledge test I took before being hired), but the day I started I 
discovered that customers were launching more questions at me than I would 
ever imagine.

The first thing I realized was that an alarming percentage of the customers 
should NOT have been working on their own cars. They came into the store 
wanting a free diagnosis for the problems as well as a detailed lecture on 
how to fix the car. Many had not invested in even the most basic service 
manual and were not equipped the the proper tools for the job.

I also noticed that a suprising number of people did not know their car. By 
this I mean the basic information needed for getting the right part (year, 
model, modifications etc). Often times, these people would come storming 
back into the store furious about getting the wrong part. In fact, they were 
given the &quot;right&quot; part based on the information given to the guy behind the 
counter.  Wrong information will usually result in the wrong part.

Here are some examples:

1) A man comes into the store and custom orders a set on interior panels for 
his 1965 Bug. (They were brown and gold if I remember correctly). When they 
arrive he takes them home a begins installing them. For some reason the door 
panels just won't fit. He comes back to the store confident that we had 
ordered the wrong panels for his car.  I go out into the parking lot and 
immediately see the problem: his 1965 Bug had 1964 doors on it. Being a 
special order item, we could not take the panels back and he was stuck with 
them. We had ordered what he said to order.

2) Another man comes into the store and orders all new brake parts for his 
1962 Bug. He buys everything (drums, shoes, wheel cylinders, springs, hoses, 
master cylinder, etc). He takes them home and discovers that nothing looks 
right. He comes back to the store to let us know that everything we sold him 
was &quot;wrong&quot;. Once again I walk out into the parking a quickly discover the 
problem: His 1962 Bug was on a 1970 pan.  Since the parts he had purchased 
were normal stocking items, we were able to exchange those parts for the 
real right parts.

3) Another guy walks into the store and orders new custom seat covers for 
his 1973 Bug. About a week later he comes in to pick them up. For some 
reason he decides to try to wrestle them on out in the parking lot. 
Frustrated, he storms back into the store complaining about the poor fit of 
his new covers. Again I walk out into the parking lot to look into the 
matter. As it turns out, his 1973 Bug was actually a 1972. Again, these were 
special order items that could not be returned.

Other areas of trouble are engine swaps, distributor swaps, 12 volt 
conversions, alternator conversions, engines with displacements other than 
stock, some sort of &quot;performance&quot; carb or exhaust system, whether it is a 
Super Beetle or a Standard Beetle, whether it is a Westfalia or some other 
camper, or any other modification, information or statistic  that the 
customer was unaware of or failed to inform us of.  Bus owners and Dune 
Buggy guys seemed to be least likely to know what engine or suspension 
mis-matches were part of their cars.

So how do we solve this problem?

1) Buy and read the right service manual!

2) Know what year and model you are driving. Is it a Standard Beetle or a 
Super Beetle?

3) Know what modifications have been made. Is it 6 or 12 volt? Does it have 
the stock engine for its' year? Does it have one-piece windows? Factory 
sunroof or aftermarket?

4) Question the person you buy the car from to find out what is not normally 
found on this year of car.  Write down the information for later use.

5) Have the chassis and engine numbers handy when buying parts.

6) Bring in the old part or at least the part number if you have any doubts.

Following this information should help reduce the number of &quot;wrong&quot; parts 
purchased for your car. I realize that the vast majority of the people on 
this list are able to spot deviations from the norm on their cars, but if I 
can get through to just one person then it was all worth it.

I retrospect, I would have to say that working at that parts store was more 
fun than any job I have had before and since.

right part...
