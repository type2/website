Subject: Re: [VB] Interior Question

It's a 'Kustom Camper' Has the KK initials on the magazine holder on the
drivers side rear.
I took a pic of it at Ennis. I actually met him and his family at Bug Swarm
in Arlington a few months back but I forget his name. Real nice guy, he
didn't even know I was a bus guy but offered me a glass of brew from his 5
liter mini keg like you get in Europe he had set up in his bus! He's from
somewhere in California (still has the black CA plates) but lives near
Dallas now. I think he said the company was in CA also. It is a sweet bus
with a tent and all. He didn't have that cutout above the cabinet, that
looks like something added on by a PO.
I uploaded a pic at www.vintagebus_dot_com Look for 'Kustom&quot; in the search
section. I thought I took more than one pic but I guess I didn't.

&gt; Hi Don,
&gt;   I saw an interior like yours at Ennis last month but I can't remember
the
&gt; name.  It was 2 words and started with a K or a C.  Something like Custom,
&gt; Classic, Craft, I don't remember.  Jim Share, did you see it? The cabinet
&gt; was exactly like the one in your link and on the opposite side was
something
&gt; that looked like a magazine rack with the manufacturers name wood burned
&gt; into it. I also, would guess that the U-shaped bracket was to hold a
child's
&gt; cot.
&gt; Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
&gt;
&gt; Wayne
&gt; '67 camper
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Can someone click on this link and tell me what the the U shaped cutout
on
&gt; &gt;the shelf above the closet door was for?  I have a '61 panelvan that I am
&gt; &gt;trying to identify the interior on and my closet and sliding door match
the
&gt; &gt;one in this picture exactly.  Maybe someone put a westy interior in the
&gt; &gt;panelvan but I have no idea what that cutout would be for.  Thanks.  Don.
