Subject: auto show

hey all..
Is anyone thinking about going to the big Auto show in Chicago on the
16th??  I'm pondering the idea as it is supposedly a huge show where you
can see a lot of REALLY cool things...
mebbe a &quot;new bus&quot; will be there? (bus content) hehehe
Has anyone ever gone to this show before??
lemme know if you're going/been there...

later
