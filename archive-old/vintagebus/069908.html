&gt; This can be checked by us 'non-college' folk as well.

&gt; Run some small clear tubing (fish store would be ideal), and run the hose
&gt; from the driver seat, back to the engine bay. Put the end of the hose in a
&gt; jar filled with colored water and haul ass down the freeway. The more the
&gt; water sucks up the clear tube, the more vacuum there is. (the smaller the
&gt; tube the better). Bad part is, this gives no 'numbers' to reference for
&gt; other people.

Sure it gives numbers!  Measure how far the water column rises and it will
give you a pressure differential in inches of water, a perfectly good
pressure measurement for relatively low pressures.
