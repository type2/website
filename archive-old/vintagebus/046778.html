Alright.....Its coming down to the wire!
I need a few pieces of glass to make this bus roadworthy!
I would like to take it to the Vintage Meet in Seattle next month.
HUGE trip for me! 2700 miles round trip!
I did it last year with the rusty monster bus! I want to do it again!
This time it should be easier as the bus wont blow a quart of oil every 100 
miles!
But...the idea of traveling with missing windows doesn't appeal to me!
(Especially with the rotten mohair headliner!)
I NEED HELP!
Heres a copy of my ad.
Paying top dollar plus shipping for decent pieces!
Come on Robert, John Howard....Ronnie....anyone!
Help add to the numbers of busses that make the show!
