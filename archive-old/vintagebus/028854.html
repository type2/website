The Universal Corporation makes a device that kills your ignition 20
seconds after you start the engine if you don't push a button that you
hide somewhere. If the device kills the engine, then the vehicle won't
start again until you push the button and then you still have to push it
before 20 seconds runs out. This can get confusing, but that's the whole
point. Not much chance that a joyrider will figure it out. My wife hates
it. I love it.

The Universal Corp. is the company that makes the CD ignition that Bob
Hoover used to recommend on this list. Call them at (970) 242-5267.
They're in Grand Junction, CO in case the area code has changed. I think
it cost about $50. No affiliation blah blah, satisfied customer blah
blah.
