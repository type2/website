Very true.
The C.E. safaris set me back 495$ after shipping (I opted for them to keep 
their wipershafts) but they look KILLER once installed.
Look for my (now sold) 58 singlecab at kelly park.
Its got a set of C.E. safaris installed.
They look and function great as far as im concerned!
Stop by and say hi as ill be the one driving the truck into kelly park.

&lt;&lt;I think that's a true statement when it comes to *installation*, but
I think over time, the CE's will pay back severalfold:  better fit,
better construction (my wolfgang frames broke within a couple months or
so), better seals.  And better looks.
