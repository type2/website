&gt; Tonight I had the guru blast my tranny carrier and nosecone clean in his
&gt; Snap On blasting cabinet.  This item is a $4200 piece of equipment and he
&gt; offered it to me for $1,000.  Man, if I only had $1,000 to spend.  You can
&gt; put ANYTHING into this cabinet and it comes out sparking clean - 110F
&gt; detergent solution cleans it all!  Anyhow, my nosecone bushings are shot and
&gt; I'm going to have to drill old ones and install new ones - where do I find
&gt; these bushings?
&gt;
&gt; Also I'm weighing my options as for the reverse lights thing.  Wade gave me
&gt; a nice list of alternatives.  I could drill and tap my nosecone for the
&gt; reverse light switch (which I would love to do as I have tons of reverse
&gt; switches on all these junk trannies).  I could also just get a 67 nosecone
&gt; with the switch already installed (needle in haystack) or KOCH's has a gizmo
&gt; that fastens to the speedo cable and trips the lights once you start backing
&gt; up.  I like the last idea but once again - it's more money.  In the interest
&gt; of time, I may just go ahead and use this nosecone but add the KOCH's unit
&gt; later once the VISA gets paid off.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone got the nose cone bushings?

Have you thought of a discretely placed toggle switch for your back up lights?
I have the &quot;back of the speedo&quot; switch on my early cars that I DON'T drive
daily, reason, the car has to be moving for the lights to come on. Which is ok
sometimes, but other times it's nice to see what's behind you before you back
up. My '56 Panel has a Fat _at_$$ light on the rack facing rearward and a switch
mounted discretely below the dash next to the button for my uuuuuuuuuhh gaaaaaa
horn. No holes drilled.

Try it, you might like it.
