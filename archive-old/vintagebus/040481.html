I sent 2 or 3 of them in with a guy named Ric, but NEVER have gotten
anything back from them. Not even a dear John letter. Thats been over a year
ago.

Hey all,

   I recall people saying both good and bad results trying to obtain
records from VW regarding their beloved cars.

  Did people getbetter results when they enclosed the 10DM?  I have a
friend going to Germany and will have him get me some DeutcheMarks for
specifically this purpose.

   Any thoughts?
