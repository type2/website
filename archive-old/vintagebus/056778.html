Subject: Re: [VB] Gear Box Maintenance

ya, and while you have the rear wheels off the ground, or even have the 
wheels off, try he rear drums for wiggle.   they should not wiggle or thunk- 
if you do you should look at new reduction bearings.  think there should only 
be a hair of wiggle- a thunk thunk is bad.  But keeping enough clean oil in 
there makes them last a long time.

 &gt;I am at the point where I need to perform maintenance on the gear
 &gt;reduction boxes and the tranny.  On the my 59 I am assuming it is
 &gt;all original so I would be looking for maintenance on this set up.
 
 I did this to my '64 and it's pretty easy.  Run the Bus right before 
 you do this to heat up the gear oil and make it drain quicker -
 it's pretty thick.  Jack up the back end of the Bus, take the rear
 wheels off, and put it on jack stands - try to have it at norma....snip &gt;&gt;
