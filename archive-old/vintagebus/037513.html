Hi all this is my first posting so here goes.I'v just picked up a 59 Pannel
with semaphores(but the semaphores are missing, although I know who has
them)now this is my question. Is there a differance between bus and beetle
semaphores? and do bus semaphores have a 2...... part number?
 --  - -
the semaphores on buses have bug (111 etc) part numbers.   This means that the
same semaphore on a bug was also used on a bug.   What style is correct for
your bus  depends on year of production, as far as I can tell.      The
grooved kind was 53 and earlier, the 54 I had had the flat kind (they had to
be original-  blinkers were put on the front, it seems when the bus was pretty
new, the semaphores looked unused, that bus was very original, though well
worn. (Farm van)
