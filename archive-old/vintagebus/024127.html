When ever I am out stalking chicks at the mall, I always say to myself, either
she will or she won't. The ones that won't we call &quot;high maintenance&quot;, the
ones that will, well, there are none that will. Anyways, high maintenance
means she won't ride in a bus 'cause it is either to warm, uncomfortable for
her hiney, slooow, and that there is no vanity mirror on the back side of the
cardboard visor! We could all ride around with Clara or Michelle in our bus?
Take turns? My bus is lowered so Clara might not ride. Damn!!
