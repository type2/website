My 1835 developed a similar noise at about 2500 miles. Upon inspection I discovered that the wave washers had gone south. Fortunately I found all of the parts (large enough to find), changed the oil, installed solid type rockers and all is well. I would inspect the rockers. Disassemble them and look for fatigue and thin spots. Replace everything that looks at all questionable and check the geometry.

Good luck.
