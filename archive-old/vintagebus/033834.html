I ignored most of the  thread that originated as firetruck FS, but I've been
thinking as similar issues have come up every so often and unfortunately seem
to keep pushing people's buttons

While preferring the vintage restoration ideal, I actually in real terms tend
to be one of these fix the d%#m bus and drive it types.   Maybe I am obsessive
about figuring what came on what models/years, some of it is practical  as
some parts dont fit, and some cosmetic, but I really like jigsaw puzzles, and
it doesn't harm anyone. 

----&gt;   What I am into is the feeling that the bus is not just a vehicle or a
item or a possession.   It is more than that.     For those of you who are
NEATO members, you may have noticed that a new chapter was formed in Alberta,
Canada, called COAT, Caretakers Of Alberta Transporters.  I really like that.
I agree with the idea that we are caretakers of these special, beautiful, and
endearing (despite their quirks and the troubles they cause us) old buses.
Why do we feel so strongly?   It seems to me that pretty much everyone on this
list has a strong feeling for their bus.  Some express the hope it'll be in
the family for decades to come.   We can feel their personalities.  Okay, I'm
getting kind of woo woo here.   But I think we have a responsibility to the
buses.   There is an intrinsic value in these buses that is not measured in
dollars.   Something that transcends personal ownership.  It connects us.

   Which is why VW people wave to each other, and will even stop and  offer
help to complete strangers in buses broken down on the side of the road.  And
why people smile at old buses, and wave and toot, and people tell you when
they had one twenty years ago.

That is why people wrote to the guy who had a 58 SC he didn't have time/space
for and talked of parting it out, and said-why part it out- find someone who
wants to take care of it, fix it up and enjoy it (and give it a good home).
Because we want to see them saved.   And I think that this list is a wonderful
forum to share our experiences, opinions,  bus troubles,  questions, stories
etc.   And why if someone says they think they'll cut the dash for a stereo
people would say- whoo- not such a good idea- put it under the dash, or find
another stereo, or I did that years ago and it was such a dumn move.
Cause we have done things or see things done that we wish weren't so.  And
hope that the same things won't happen again.   

And though someone may say hey it's mine (quoting property rights) I can do
whatever I feel like to  it,  I guess I feel it's still a bad idea to do
certain things, and suggest  thinking about safety, and the idea of being a
caretaker of your bus.   Things can be bolted on and off, and I wouldn't paint
a bus bright yellow with flames (though I saw one like that and it did look
kinda cool if you like the 70s) but cutting things in or drilling holes in the
dash is usually annoying.  (except where a hole was cut out before and really
badly welded up, though I did put extra lights on the back of my truck (w/o
drilling holes)- must have visible lights- though that story is still not yet
over)    

And somettimes people say they are considering such and such a mod,    which
could be detrimetal to the buses structural integrity.     I know a lot of
people think sunroofs are cool, but you can't just cut a huge hole in the roof
of your non sunroof bus and pop in a ragtop without compromising safety.
I didn't know that 5 years ago.      I wish there was a list like this around
when I was learning VWs, as I could have saved myself time money and energy.
I would have known about the existance of brake hoses and recognised the signs
of them going bad and changed them before driving to Oregon and up and down
mountains and having one completely blow out on the way  home.
