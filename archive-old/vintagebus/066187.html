Subject: Electrical Troubleshoot

Hello Everyone,

I know it's not a friday, but I'm caught in a jam, and y'all are the best 
resource I know of for automotive diagnostics.   I'm trying to troubleshoot 
an electrical problem in my 1998 subaru legacy.  I' want to repair it 
myself, so that I can save my money for paint for the bus (bus content).  
Hit the delete key now to get back to more vintagebus discussions.

If you've made it to this point,  here's the situation.  Dome light was left 
on in car overnight.  Started fine this morning driving to drop off my son 
at daycare.  On the way to daycare, the ABS light in the dash turns on 
intermittently, and when it does there is a hum through the radio speakers, 
and the speedo needle gets herky jerky.  Get to day care, shut off motor and 
go inside.  When I came back out, the car will not start, no click no 
nothing.  At first, I still have power to run the accessories (radio, 
windows, fan).  Thouhght maybe battery was dead, found someone to jump it 
for me, no joy.  Again, no click, nothing.  After a couple more tries, radio 
and such will not turn on, and windows won't go down.  I got my brother to 
come over and help me drag the car home, it's in my driveway, waiting for me 
to tear into it this evening after work.  And I was going to get a couple 
coats of primer on the bus tonight... sigh.

My conclusion is that the alternator is bad.  When it ran this morning, I 
was just using the electricity stored in the battery.  By the time I got to 
day care, the battery was discharged enough that it couldn't start the car.  
  That would also explain the electrical oddities that were going on during 
the drive.   Anyone have any other things I should look at, or test before I 
remove the alternator this evening?

Please do not reply to this address, as anyone that uses hotmail can 
attests, I get way too much garbage.  This acount is filtered only to
