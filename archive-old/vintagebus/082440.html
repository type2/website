I laughed until I cried, when I read this.

Some of us are not only Mac users, some of us even buy, sell, and 
service Macintosh and other Apple products!

Busses and Macs...they really do seem to go together. Must be that 
whole &quot;Think Different&quot; mindset we all share. In fact, when we were 
driving our recently purchased &quot;Konrad&quot; 1969 Westy from Winston-Salem, 
NC to Charleston, SC, I had my iPod secured to the dash and headphones 
set lightly in my ear so I could listen to the engine. And yes, our bus 
has more than its share of Apple stickers.
