Subject: Re: [VB] Clacking from under valve covers on 40 HP

of valve chatter coming from what sounds like under the right side valve 
cover on a 40 HP engine? &gt;&gt;

Hi John,
Could be a screwed up/broken rocker arm, a broken push rod, a pulled out 
early studed head stud that holds down the rocker, or just a valve out of 
adjustment due to the mechanic not having tightened down the lock nut.
