&quot;It will work for a while, but will destroy the flywheel and the starter
pinion gear.&quot;

How long is a while?  I intend to keep the 6v starter (loving the way it
turns over), but after non-use for about 6 mos, the pinion shaft got all
gummed up and the solenoid can't push it out.  I can pry it out with a
screwdriver, but it stays engaged.  Anyway, I have the 12v starter in
another bus that I'm not using, and was hoping to use it for a week or so
while I rebuild the 6v.  Is this reasonable or is it
quit-trying-to-cut-corners dumb?
