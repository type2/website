Subject: Book Boxes [books shoved aside to make room for computer books]

Digging through my book box .. I know there are a few more to find because I
can remember a smaller book that I had in my glove box of the 71 that was
pretty old.

But so far I have found:
1)  Aircooled VW - Engine Interchange Manual [guide to original and
aftermarket parts for tuning.]
2)  Chilton's repair and tune up guide, 1949-1971
3)  John Muir's book ..

Gonna do some homework ..

OH .. almost forgot .. Divine Right's Trip by Gurney Norman.  A real KEEPER
!!
