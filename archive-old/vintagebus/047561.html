&gt; I have three questions about the What-Not cabinet in my SO-42 Westy (the
&gt; &quot;shelf&quot; that hangs on the rear cargo door).  First, what kind of wood is it
&gt; made out of?  I know the interior panels are made of baltic-birch plywood,
&gt; is the shelf made out of the same thing?  Couldn't find out in the archives
&gt; or library.
&gt; 
&gt; Next, can somebody point me to a picture of the back side of the shelf
&gt; (attachment point to the cargo door bracket)?  That part of mine is
&gt; broken/missing

Yes, my 65 westy is missing this whatnot cabinet (aka spice rack)too, and I would really like to find one.   It is made of the same stuff the rest of the camper kit is- that formica fake wood covered stuff, with white plastic trim, and the lid on top hinges with a I think brass piano hinge.  The face of the shelves is thinner (1/8 inch?) stuff, tacked on with brass brads if I remmeber right.  somewhere I took measurements from one.    Also made a deal in which I am owed one, but it hasn't showed up (sigh) better go bug them some more.

as to how it attaches to the door, there is a metal bracket (painted grey) that screws to the door.  The cabinet you drop it onto the bracket, and then there are a couple screws lower down that just keep it from banging around.
