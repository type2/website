Subject: Getting dissy trying to figure out the dizzys!

I know we have covered distributors a bunch but I have never seen details on
the proper detailed functioning on a vacuum dizzy.  

The local junkyard guy got me thinking this weekend when I picked up used
205 T (not sure if the &quot;T&quot; matters) dizzy (for $10, because no one uses
them!).  The junk man claimed that the 205 pure vacuum advance would not
work well on a bus.  He claimed the correct distributor would be a Bosch
SVDA (SDDA) Distributor, with vacuum advance (as described from
aircooled_dot_net) because it is mechanical with vacuum helper.  Any thoughts on
this?  I assumed most people ran pure vacuum distributors..?
 
I use a 205 in my bus with a 30-PICT-3 carb on a DP manifold and love it.
It is only vacuum advance but does not seem to matter.  I get 23 MPG LOADED
westi (not quite the 24 MPG Bentley says I should get).  I time it at 32
degrees all in...  Not sure what it is at idle without vacuum attached.
Should be 7.5 BTDC from what Bentley claims.
 
I bought the 205 T dizzy for a buddy in his newly acquired '71 westi with DP
engine.  Switching from 009 dizzy, yuck!  Cleaned up the dizzy and put in
all new components, now we have a $30 distributor, still a deal.  Put the
dizzy in and fired her up, runs great BUT the vacuum seems to be always on
to far at idle.  When it is revved up the vacuum only goes out another 5-10
degrees.  Running a Brazilian 30/31 Bocal carb on a DP manifold, wondering
if the vacuum is different than the 30 PICT-3 that is was designed to work
with?

In theory I think when timed at 7.5 BTDC w/o vacuum the with vacuum timing
should be around 10 BTDC and when revved at 3500RPM should come out to 30-32
degrees BTDC....?

In an effort to clean this problem up I have a 30-PICT-3 I will rebuild
(matches 205 dizzy from VW installations) and hopefully the vacuum from the
carb will be correct..?

Then again the spring on the vacuum rod may be too soft, but seemed okay and
is attached properly.

Also the dizzy shaft is good and there is no timing wobble.

...  Ah the joys of loosing sleep over helping a buddy :)


Thanks,
