Subject: Wiper arms, safaris, &amp; the AIRS site...

We got a call at home this afternoon from &quot;Shawn&quot; [Sean?] of Spokane, WA.
He was in Tacoma visiting friends.  I still don't know his last name.

Seems he came over Snoqualmie Pass last night in a downpour, and before he
reached the summit he lost his 1 [and only] wiper arm.  Off his '62 Type 2.
With safari windshields/windscreens.  He was desperate to find at least 1
replacement arm and blade so he could return to Spokane tonight, over
Snoqualmie Pass, in a downpour.

My daughter called all over the Tacoma area trying to track down the part,
without success.  I discussed the situation with Shawn, covering all
possible scenarios including a large supply of RAIN-X.  His friends found a
couple of leads up Seattle way, and Shawn was considering following them up
but his time was getting pretty tight.  He promised to let us know how his
journey home panned out.

The point of all this is that Shawn called me because he found my name on
the AIRS website.  And how that came about is beyond me, because Shawn was
totally unaware of the Vintagebus List or the Type 2 List, or even
Type2_dot_com.  I gave him the info. he needed to connect with the Lists, and
perhaps he'll post an account of his adventure some time.

I'm still amazed at how far the tentacles of the VW community and this
Internet thing really reach.  For a few hours today more than a dozen
individuals and businesses were doing all in their power to bail out a total
stranger and get him safely back on the road home.

FWIW.....
