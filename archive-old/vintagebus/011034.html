Hello .............. 

If anyone in the midwest area is looking for a bus, I found one. I
happened to be in Des Moines (iowa) today and saw a split. I jammed on
the brakes and made a quick u-turn. There aren't many splits running
around these parts. So I figured I better investigate. Well i stop,  get
out and meet Dan the owner.  And we commenced talking &quot;bus&quot;.  Come to
find out he's trying to sell this bus.  And a nice bus it is.  A 1967
white/dove blue deluxe.  This bus was originally from California, and is
in pretty good shape.  A little rust and a couple of small dents but
nothing major.  The nose, corners, look good, and it's never been in an
accident.  The interior is in pretty good shape, too, but middle seat is
missing.  Also has a '69 bug motor in it.  He's asking $3200.  If I had
some extra Johnny Cash lying around, I'd buy it myself.  But alas, I'm
still broke from fixing my own bus.  Let me know if anyone's interested.
Any questions, please feel free to contact me and I'll do my best to
give you an answer.  I'd really like the bus to stay around these here
parts, but most people around here have no idea how cool it is owning a
Volkswagen bus.  Poor misguided souls.  See ya, take care, Shawn
