Subject: 109 or 130?

Last summer i bought a '61 Westy.
Warm weather is here, and it's time to get it going!
The original 36hp motor was in the passenger area with
a big hole in the block.

Some big ugly 12-volt buggy motor had been jammed in
the back, but i suspect they never got it running
because the vehicle had been sitting for 10 years, and
there were still signs of 6-volt operation in the
vehicle. (6-12 inverter for a CB up front)

So I pulled out the buggy motor, and am preparing to
put in another motor, but I want to make sure I get
the flywheel and starter correct. Can I assume that
since the ugly buggy motor had a 130 tooth flywheel on
it the bellhousing has already been ground out?

would a 130-tooth even fit in there if not?

How can I tell if the starter is a 6 or 12 volt?

How can I tell if the proper bushing has been
installed to use a 12 volt starter?

I noticed some metal shavings in the bellhousing and
on one spot of the flywheel, like maybe something
wasn't right...

Thanks for your help!
