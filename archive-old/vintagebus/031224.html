Well, when I got this fan shroud I wondered what the funny ring on the 
front of it was.  I asked the list and someone? said it was from a fuel 
injected beetle.  I forget who said it...

What it is, is a ring that is welded to the front of the fan shroud on 
the fan intake.  Its spot welded on with 4 little tabs.  The ring is 
contoured to the curve of the fan intake, so it dips down into the fan 
shroud just a tad.  I know this doesn't give that good of a picture in 
your head, but I don't know how else to describe it.  I'm really not 
sure of its purpose...maybe to direct the air flow a little better or 
take any noise away from air being sucked in??  I don't know.  All I 
know is &quot;velocity ring good.&quot;

Sorry I can't be more specific.  Hopefully someone else can chime in. 
I'd go take a picture, but the engine is in the bus.  Maybe I can cram 
my camera back there a little later...
