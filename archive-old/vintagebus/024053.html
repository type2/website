Subject: Wire welding on body panels

Body welders,
Is it necessary to use shielding gas when welding in rust replacement
panels or will
flux cored wire work as well? What gauge wire is best with the flux
cored stuff.
Is there a most desirable wire speed/amperage or is this best determined
by  experimentation? Thanks in advance and I really dig this list and
the people who
post on it. Pat.  sally_at_onramp_dot_com
