I would support the reprinting of the 1955 edition, as I think it is more
important than the May 1959-62 edition.  There is VERY LITTLE info
in the May 1959-62 edition that is not already covered in the 1963-67
reprint that is already available and the 1955 edition fills in all the gaps
that the 1963-67 leaves out while giving all the valuable info for March
1955-58 buses.  In short, I think the 1955 edition reprint should be the
priority.

In saying that, I have a pristine copy of the May 1959-62 edition (sans
electrical diagrams) and a very nice condition complete 1955 edition
that I would be willing to loan RB for the project.  When I met Stan at
the Classic a couple of years ago I made this offer to him, but he
thought the market for the early reprints was too limited at that time.

&gt;
&gt;Currently I have two original copies
&gt;of the May 1959-1962 factory transporter manual. Having two copies allows me
&gt;to verify them against each other to confirm that the one we reproduce will
&gt;have a good chance of having all the correct pages. I have nothing for early
&gt;(pre-1959) buses.
&gt;
&gt;Based on the cost of doing previous vintage workshop manual reproductions, I
&gt;would estimate that if you came up with 350-400 individuals that would be
&gt;willing to pay a minimum of $109.95 for this manual we would see this as
&gt;something worth getting into our production schedule. Keep in mind that it
&gt;will only cover back to May of 1959 (1192cc; 36 SAE bhp and 40 SAE bhp
&gt;motors).
&gt;
&gt;In order to cover the earlier buses I would need to find original workshop
&gt;manuals to reproduce from. I have yet to see one at the various VW shows I
&gt;attend throughout the U.S. and Germany. This would also be an entirely
&gt;separate product from the '59-'62 book.
