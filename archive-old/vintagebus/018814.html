i assume you are referring to the repop's that bergmann is offering. in
*theory* they offer 4 times the air volume as a conventional dog house type
cooling system. i think it is fair to assume that 4 times the theoretical
cooling that the repops supposedly will cost you 4 times the price.

personally i will stick with my more or less stock easy to fix cheap to run dp
1600 until something goes drastically wrong which it which it hasn't in 8
years.

also a lot more stoopid proof for wannabe mechanics like moi

m.


When you say &quot;porsche fan shroud&quot; do you mean 356/912 911, or 914?  I
assume 911, since that's what all the go-fast kids talk about.

From what I've heard, they don't work any better.  Personally,  I 
think it's just an appearance enhancement.  If one was *properly*
fitted,  - and there *is* ducting inside, which I haven't seen on the
repros, I'm sure it would cool well, but a properly set up stock one would 
also work just as well.  I think this is another case of &quot;why fix the stock 
setup when I can just throw more money at it with aftermarket components 
and look kewel&quot; 

Now if you want the Real Deal for air flow, go with a 935 flat
fan setup.  Of course, just the parts alone will probably cost more
than your entire investment in the car...
