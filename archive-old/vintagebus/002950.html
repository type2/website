Hi all,
Someone mentioned earlier that they had just got the 'making the vw go' book
and was really enjoying it.  The other good one is on ebay right now and
will end shortly.  It was printed by Clymer in the early 60's and is
defiantly a good read.

Item #424695790

BTW, I'd bid but I already have a copy and I don't have any connection to
the person selling the book.  Earlier versions have sold for $20 to well
over $100(!).  I got mine from barnes and noble; (no relationship to Greg
;-) )  for around $25.


David
