Your not looking in the right spots.  The one I cut up I found last year.  The yard is in the valley.

It doesn’t happen often.  I get the feeling that they are siphoned off as soon as they come in.  Some one/s has a standing order with all the yards to buy any one that comes in.

&lt;&lt;I used a hack saw and one of those $2 hack saw blade holders to cut

out a passenger door hinge pillar and a piece of the front skin.

Worked OK. Took about 30 minutes of hacking. Surprising how effective.

You could cut up a whole bus, given time and a lot of energy.
