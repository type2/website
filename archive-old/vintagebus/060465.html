Subject: Re: [VB] Sender not sending?

Ok,
  I am ready to let go of it. The stunning reallity is that I have no time
to restore this thing.  Here are the details:
67 doormobile Green. Solid 1600 engine. New master cylinder, that needs to
be installed. That was tough to find let me tell. ya. This is located in the
Seattle area, and it would need to be towed. The camper part that makes it a
dormobile is complete and in good condition. pops up with good canves. There
is some rust on both bottom quarter panels. On small dent on the rear left
corner. Interior is kinda beat. I am in the midst of trying to figure out
the value of it, so any offers would be considered.
