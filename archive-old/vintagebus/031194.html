&gt; Hi Ken,
&gt; Sounds like you should try to start it a couple of more times.  
 &gt;snip&lt;
&gt; storing a used engine it really helps to
&gt; squirt some oil into the spark plug holes and change the engine case oil to
&gt; help prevent this kind of proplems due to corrosion!   Eric&amp;Barb

E&amp;B, thanks for your encouragement!

I would have done better to put some junk heads on this thing to keep
the air out rather than just covering it, fortunately there was no rust
on the cylinders (that I could see anyway)

Aloha,
Ken Alford
