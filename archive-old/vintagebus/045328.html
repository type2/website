Hi Volks,
This brings to mind a broken devise we saw years ago that was a franell (SP?) 
lense (like a lighthouse has.) to refract the image of stop lights to the 
eyes of drivers of chopped topped american lead sled!  It suctioned cupped to 
the dash.  Maybe someone on the list knows about this item or knows someone 
who would and where to buy them.  Eric&amp;Barb
