Subject: Re: re: classic insurance

i had this SAME discussion with my State Farm agent. he has my '66 insured 
for stated value for $100/year. i asked him about the rusty '77 i got last 
year and he said, &quot;its not pretty enough, they will want it fully restored.&quot; 
i dont get it, whats the difference if we agree on a stated value.

i hate car insurance its such a scam!!
