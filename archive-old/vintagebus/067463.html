Subject: Re: [VB] Exper. w/ speedometer repair shops?

I have worked with North Hollywood Speedometer, and can not say enough good 
things about them.  They are fast, friendly, and do fantastic work.  Their 
turn around time is pretty good, and they will even do custom work (in my 
case, rebuidling my speedo and making it look like a cockpit royale speedo).

Good Luck
