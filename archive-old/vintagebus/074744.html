Subject: Bring Plenty of Bug Spray

I was outside tonight cleaning out some coffee cups etc from the bus and the
mosquitos were especially vicious!! So anyone thinking about camping out, I
hope will think to bring plenty of bug spray or &quot;Off&quot; or ???

I decided **for sure** that I am going to Tampa in the morning.  Being my
bus needs everything and it will probably be a good time to find a home for
the later model back seat that I have postponed removing for months now.
