Subject: Chet &amp; Kelley made it!

Hey all,  We made it to Spokane, WA today.  We're visiting some of
Kelly's
family for a couple days.  All went fine, just need to add some tranny
fluid
tomorrow.  Right reduction gear leaks a lot, the tire is splattered
inside
and out, along with the wheel well.  Will do a complete write-up once we
get
a house.  Take care all bus folk.  Happy driving--Chet

I'd rather be poor and unknown.  If I were rich the gummint
would take the rest of my money.  If I was famous, everybody'd
be digging in my business.  You don't even know my dog's name.
