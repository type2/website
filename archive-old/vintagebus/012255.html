Hey Volks,
  Well while visitng my local VW Heaven( excuse me salvage yard) today I
happened to mention to the proprieter that I may be in the market for a new
shifter and what did he reccomend.  He said he had always preferred the
hurst on his busses and recommended one of them.  After a little bs he
opened up and said he had an old one and said he would sell it to me for
25.00.  Well to make a long story short this shifter after clean up turns
out to be copper plated.  Looks really neat.  Anyone know anything about
this particular shifter when it was made if it is worth anything, any info
is appreciated.
