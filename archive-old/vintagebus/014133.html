I am sorry i don't wuite understand your response. It sounds like you do not
have the seal for the earlier bus. Is the seal for the newer bus only longer?
(Could I just cut the new seal to make it a shorter?) Basically is the section
of the seal the same for both models?

Thanks for your help with this matter, as I have more tyhasn a few people here
in the US looking for these seals.

-Kevin



Hello Kevin,

this seal is the same as the new model - 71. The seal for the new bus is only
a 
little bit longer. Sorry the otherone (shorter one) we couldn`t offer you. 
If you want to proove it - the orig.VW number is 211 707 397 B ( with A until

67)

best regards

&gt; will they fit? 
&gt; My understanding is that there is ones style for 1959-1967 and one for
&gt; 1968-1972.
&gt;
&gt; I am interested in the model for the earlier bus.
