&gt; im trying to replace my old dashboard with a better condition one but the

Hi Josh,
Huh!?!?  To replace the dash board you need to cut it out and weld in a new 
one.  Are you perhaps trying to replace the package tray?!?!  If so disconnect 
the cable from the left front hub cover and pull it out of the spindle.  
Remove left front kick panel and pull up cable.  Unscrew cable from front of speedo 
and pull out entire cable.  Make sure to take close look and perhaps photos 
at where cable passes through so you can replace it properly!!!!
