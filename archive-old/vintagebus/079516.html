Subject: Re: [VB] gas tank leak anyone?

I haven't actually had a gas tank leak,   but it's not impossible that it 
could happen.

Just drove fromOly WA to Bay Area, CA.   not the shortest way.  Tried to go 
to Crater Lake and the road was closed due to snow.    Stopped, andlooked 
around a bit, and got back in the bus, which suddenly smelled badly of gas.   Yes I 
was parked on a slant, but it had been 30 miles since filling up.   Looked 
everywhere for a leak and couldn't find one uner the bus or in engine 
compartment or anywhere he source of the smell.   However, I suspect gas expanded, maybe 
that was it.   Mystery continues,  gas smell cleared out, but came back when 
I was in the eastern Or near Klamtah Falls at teh ranger station.   Could just 
be expansion due to warming up... seemed to be getting good milage too.... as 
much as 27 or 30 at some fill ups... even with the larger tires on the front 
than last summer, hey I'm not complaining... the last tank was filled ~220 
miles ago and I haven't switched to reserve yet.  

I have seen fuel lines ooze and leak, (replaced mine last month) .   Is your 
problem the lines?    or the seal wher ethe thingy screws up under the tank?   
 I'd drain the tank, and take that screw on thing off, and check the sock, 
and reinstall w/ a new seal.   If the ooze was coming from a place that was away 
frm the spout I'd say the tank was KIA, but maybe it wants a new seal
