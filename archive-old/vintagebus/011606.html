Here's two cents worth on motor oil from _hot_ Southeast Texas:

It's true that the VW owner's manuals used to recommend relatively
light weight oil.  However, the consensus among the mechanics that
I worked with in the late 60s &amp; early 70s was that here, where it's
often 100 F. or worse in the summer, SAE40 was the best for air cooled
VWs.  We'd then drop back to SAE30 in the winter, when it's seldom
below freezing.

Following this practice, I've never had any oil related engine problems.

I've seen instances in which SAE40 kept the oil pressure light from
coming on at idle on hot days in a badly worn engine, whereas it would
come on with SAE20 or 30.  That's not to say that using heavier oil is
a substitute for proper engine repairs, but I took it as an indication
that 40 weight is helpful in the summer.

Having said all this, the most important thing is to change oil frequently,
clean the oil strainer every time, and use good quality oil, not cheap
stuff or recycled oil.

Personally, I don't care so much for multigrade oils, but that's not to
say that they don't work well.  If I were to use one in an air cooled VW
in a hot climate, I think I'd choose 20W-50.  I don't have experience with
synthetic oil, so I have no comment on that aspect of the discussion.
