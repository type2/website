Hi Rob,
Definitely not a great idea to have to rely on a mystery engine for long 
distance trips.  As long as you have cash, tools and time to fix or replace 
it on the trip you should do allright.  With a new or used known engine you 
just have less chance of having major problems.
  We just talked to Butch our favorite engine builder in San Diego.  He 
recently was contacted by a fellow who said he had 15 fully rebuilt engines 
for sale all together.  Since Butch did not know this fellow and the engine 
builder was unknown to him, he made him a low bid on them.  The fellow 
accepted and showed up with only 14 engines and none of them had flywheels.  
So Butch deducted the price of one of the engines off the total price.  There 
were two 40 HP engine and two type 4s, the other ten were 1600 and 1641 type 
1/2/3 engines.  So instead of just slapping on FWs and selling these engines 
Butch and his workers tore apart the ten 1600 and 1641 type 1/2/3 engines.  
The heads had been rebuilt, but one was cracked.  There were new P&amp;Cs, cam 
bearings, main bearings, rod bearings.  The cases had all been rebored for 
the main bearings, but the cranks and connecting rods were used and had not 
been reground or rebuilt!  Suprise!  Fortunitly because Butch had bid low he 
could afford to go through these engines and do them up right.
