Hi everyone,
I know this is on the same subject, but sligthly different.
I'm about ready to put in my tranny and reduction boxes back into my 63
deluxe. 
The flange the slides over the axle that goes inside the grease seal on the
bearing cover plate. Is it supposed to slide over easily, or is it tight on
the axle. When I pulled the tranny before, I had to pound it off the axle with
a hammer and screwdriver.  I'm not sure if this would lead to bearing failure,
or just not do anything.
So if any of you reduction box gurus have an answer, please let me know.

Thanks
