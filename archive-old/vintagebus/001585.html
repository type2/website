Whoa - are those things on there!

Anyway,  I'm trying to replace my front shocks and I've got em off but I'm
having problems with the metal sleeve or bushing or whatever that thing is
the goes between the rubber and the lower stud/bolt.  The rubber thing and
the whole shock came off but the metal sleeve stayed behind.  I've tried
heat and wd-40 does anyone have any other ideas?  Should I just get out the
grinder and grind it off?
