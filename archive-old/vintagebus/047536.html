&lt;&lt; I'm putting a new Front Engine Seal in my bus and  I don't know how it 
goes.
 It is sort of Tee shaped with the tail of the Tee inclined - should it slope
 up toward the roof or down towards the ground?
 
 TIA

this being the seal between the engine and body, right?   I slope them up.  
or you can get your accelerator cable hung up on it and have to cut a V in it.
