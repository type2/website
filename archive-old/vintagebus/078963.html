Subject: part number help!

Hi All,

 

I'm trying to determine the part numbers for the rivets in the vent
window, all three of them; top pivot rivet, latch to frame and latch
catch to frame.  I went to the online parts manual but wouldn't you know
it, the page covering items 72 through 79 is missing.  Anyone have a
copy next to their computer that can tell me?  Group 8, 'Cab doors, wing
doors'

 

 

Thanks much!

 

 

David
