&lt;&lt; Yellow glass works much better than paint or tape, which is what I thought

sufficiently tinted to not look white when lit. &gt;&gt;
Hi Dworkin,
In the case of using stock bug or type 3 back up lights as supplemental rear 
brake/turn signals we were advising the use of paint on the inside of these 
lenses.  One definitely has to be carefull to procure paint of sufficient of 
yellow hue for the job if they paint the inside of the clear glass lense.  
One could instead buy bulbs coated with a translucient yellow paint or just 
paint them yourself.  Interestingly our 1963 model SC built in DEC62 came 
with it's front fried egg style turn signals from the factory with the inside 
of the lenses painted yellow!  Wether this was done this way due to a 
stocking failure at the factory of the inner yellow tinting lenses or maybe 
the yellow tinting lenses had not been produced yet is another interesting 
question!  Eric&amp;Barb
