Volks,

I'm trying to get as many local bus freaks together as possible at
Denny's on Wade Hampton Blvd. on Saturday, January 8th, around 2pm...
All buses welcomed! Pmail me for details... Let's get a local VW Box
club started!

Also, a local fellow bus phreak, Clarise, needs a tow bar to haul a '77
down to Florida and tow a '69 back up. She's willing to rent. Anyone in
the area who has one, please let me know, ASAP!

Last night we had our company Christmas dinner. Don (my boss) got me a
Mass Transit Ale beer glass, featuring a splitty on it (see a pic of it
in the RMMW catalog). Cool!
