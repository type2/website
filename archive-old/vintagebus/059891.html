Subject: 'B6' case wanted

Hi All,

I'm in need of a 'B6' case and hopefully all the hardware that goes with it.
It must be rebuildable.  I'd be willing to spend up to $150 (inc shipping)
for a nice case.  I don't want the crank, P/Cs, heads, etc... just a nice
case and the fasteners, so the shipping shouldn't be that much.

Thanks for looking through your stuff for me.
