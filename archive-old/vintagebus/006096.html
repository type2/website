&gt; could you explain this a little more for me ....what is a surface mount
&gt; speaker? is that an exposed type of speaker, where you usually only see
the
&gt; speaker grill, as opposed to one that comes enclosed? how exactly are the
&gt; attached at the underside of the parcel tray without changing the parcel
tray?

You would probably have to drill a couple holes in the tray unless you got
fancy and made some clamps.  Here is a picture of a set of these speakers -
I was going to get them but ended up getting a bigger and more powerful set.
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=468468234  Normally
these mount right side up but you simply mount them upside down under the
parcel tray.  To see where Terry mounted his, take the time to load the big
and nice interiour shot of his bus at
http://204.26.80.78:8084/OVWC/busses/bnnta1/sub1/2.html and you'll soon see
just how great of an idea this is.  Great sound and it's EXTREMELY
non-invasive.

Enjoy!
