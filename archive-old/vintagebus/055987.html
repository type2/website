Subject: Re: [VB] Trip Report 2002 Bug-In Ennis, TX

I got there late 11:30, and was surprised how few busses were in the show.
There were many more, and in some cases, better busses in the parking lot.
The swap area was good. I got a $2 horn button and a pair of original radio
knobs. After seeing them for sale on the Net for $35 a apir I found a guy at
the show that had ONE for $25, then I found a pair for $10, but then found a
pair in a box of window cranks for a buck.

Among the regulars I missed seeing was Paul Taylor and his SC. I was looking
to meet other listers at his truck at noon, oh well. Since he recently
cancelled his Oktoberbus event, I'm a little worried. I hope he is OK.

Oh yeah, in the swap area I also bought a maroon metalflake Ghia Vert in
incredibally good condition. A virtual driveaway. Her name is Ruby.

&gt; Just got back from the 2002 Bug-In at Ennis, TX. For once the weather
&gt; was nice...no April showers!!!
&gt;
&gt; Lots of nice cars. Not enough old busses for me. New Beetles seem to
&gt; be really increasing at shows I noticed. Still, lots of nice cars new
&gt; and old.
&gt;
&gt; Swap meet was great. Lots of cool stuff around. Many good prices, may
&gt; that were way too high. It's always that way I guess. I snagged a new
&gt; unused set of balljoint dropped spindles and all the bearings for the
&gt; front for my wife's 'vert....cost me only $75!!!! Also got a set of
&gt; 1959 Texas Truck license plates for my '59 Single Cab, a new German
&gt; bus muffler, an early bus apron, and (1) one dollar wheel adapter to
&gt; match one I've had sitting in a box in the garage for a
&gt; while.....gonna use the pair on my trike someday.
&gt;
&gt; Met up with a lot of VW guys from around Texas. Chris La Fon, Jim
&gt; Share, Travis, Raoul, Aaron, and a few other San Angelo guys who made
&gt; the drive.
&gt;
&gt; My 5 yr. old son liked the drag racing the best. One of the cars set
&gt; the world record at 6.2 something and 202 miles an hour on his run.
&gt; Pretty amazing for a VW engine.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I took lots of pictures. They're all up here:
