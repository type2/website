 List:
 
 Has anyone got an opinion on the Wolfsburg West door seal/weatherstrip?  
They also sell German weatherstrip, which about twice the price.  WW stuff is 
grey other with black inner, German is black/black, I think.  WW sez their 
stuff is softer, not sure if that's good or bad.
 
 I'd love to save a few bucks and get the cheaper, uhhh, let's say less 
expensive stuff.  But then again, is it the age old pay now or pay later?  I 
really don't want to have to replace this stuff a year or two down the road.
 
 TIA.

for the grey rubber that goes on the body around the cab doors, actually WCM 
makes the best repro- better contour/cross section than WW.  i was impressed 
with it.   havent scoped out the german though
