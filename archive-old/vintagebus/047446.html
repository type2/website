List,
Thanks for the advice.  We will see what his price quote turns out to be.
That will probably post to the list because it seems that many are interested.
Its not that I am trying to make this guy turn a swiss cheese van into a show
car, just that I want certain fitting points to line up right, etc.  He says
he can do it, just that it will be lots of time and money.  I think he found
it absurd that I wanted to put all this time and money into (of all things) a
Volkswagen.  It makes me pretty sad that the guy that will be doing my
bodywork thinks what I am doing is crazy.  I guess his shop is more into hot
rods and muscle cars.  But they are the only resto shop around here and I am
not a fan of the local Maaco respray alternative.  (to kill the thread before
it starts, I will admit: some Maaco's aren't that bad, my local one just isn't
going to work for me.)
