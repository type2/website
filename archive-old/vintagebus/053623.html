Subject: mirror problems

During the reassembly of my bus encountered a problem with the new/repro 
elephant ear mirrors.  They are too small of a diameter for the hole.  Is 
there a sleeve kit out there or something?  There is too much play in the 
hinge and the door doesn't line up.  Anyone else encountered this?  Didn't 
think about this before and have no reference for I had the X-L-O truck type 
mirrors before(wich are still for sale btw).

Here is a pic of the current proccess too;
