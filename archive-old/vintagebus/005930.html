NQ:

Here at the shop, we have holders for the torsion leaves that we use for
assembling the front beams. They are round on the
outside while the inside is the exact same shape as the torsion leaves stack
when they are in a beam.

Basically, it is a reproducion of the piece inside the beam that holds the
leaves in place but without a set screw hole.  We sell these for $10.00
each.

Subject: [VB] Idea for reinstalling torsion leaves.


&gt; I know it's gonna be tough when I go to reinstall the torsion leaves back
&gt; into the beam on this 67 bus.  In an effort to try to think ahead, I was
&gt; wondering if I couldn't make a tool that would ease the installation of
the
&gt; springs.  It would consist of the center section of a beam (the part that
&gt; holds the springs in their shape) and in turn, this would be welded to a
&gt; pipe which would be long enough to stick out past the end of the axle tube
a
&gt; few inches.  You would insert your torsions into the pipe and then insert
&gt; the whole appartus down into the axle beam.  Once the torsions slid out of
&gt; the pipe and into their holding collar on the inside of the beam, you
could
&gt; pull the tool out of the beam.  If this sounds feasible, I may have to
find
&gt; someone who has a wrecked type 2 beam and have them hack saw the middle
&gt; section out of the beam for me.
&gt;
&gt; Any other ideas for this procedure?
&gt;
&gt; BTW:  Today so far I've cleaned the front brake drums and had them turned.
&gt; They both cleaned up with 2 turns each - not bad for $12.   I'm headed
back
&gt; to the shop right now to finish cleaning the bearings in the beam (3 of
them
&gt; so far look to be in really good shape) and will take the beam for
blasting
&gt; tomorrow after prepping.  Later...
