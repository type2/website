Ouch! that buzzer hurt! :) 

&gt; Take a closer look at the &quot;scoops&quot; on a baywindow.  The opening is only a
&gt; few degrees away from being flat to the sides of the bus.  No ram effect
&gt; there!

I'll measure the scoops tonite &amp; check. I'll make the assumption that
the airflow tends to follow the contour of the bus by the time it gets
near the rear of the bus. The rearmost portion of the air vent is
farther out than the front. While it might be at a slight angle this
is still a free area for air to travel in when measured perpendicular
to the bus body. So there is some sort of scoop action there. Whether
or not the airflow is there to take advantage of a forced air effect
or not, I sure don't know. But I would suggest if it doesn't exist
then it wouldn't exist on the split scoops either. Just for reference
I am comparing my 66 with my 79. I'll see if I can get a rough
estimate of the actual free area from these by measuring. Then again
it's not like it suddenly makes the split scoops look better. (;
