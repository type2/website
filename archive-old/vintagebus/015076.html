I have a mid-May 36hp engine FS Appears to be complete
from std crank pulley to clutch.
TypeI stale air exhaust with muffler, all tin
exception of apron breast plate, dizzy, shroud, 28PICT
carb with aircleaner. Is not locked up and appears to
have appropriate compression for a UFO 36horse.

Case # = = 146621

By Everett's calculations it is mid-May '56.
Contact me via pmail. May be picked up at anytime
locally or saved for pick-up by out-of-towner Spring
show attendees.
