I have heard from people who rented furniture and
antique tools to movie companies to be used as props,
and got them back with a hole cut in a hutch, tools
painted, and other terrible things done to their
antiques.  In that situation, they should have gotten
full value for the use of the item, as it's antique or
collector value was destroyed.  I'd be wary of doing
this with a vehicle unless it was well insured for the
specific situation, or other circumstances warranted
doing it.
