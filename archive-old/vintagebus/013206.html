Subject: Bus Depot... why me?!
Message-ID: &lt;19990611223155.2596.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

sorry, i have to get this off my chest...
a while ago i posted to the list the numerous problems i have had with Bus 
Depot operators and getting accurate information when ordering. after 
getting frustrated each time, turning to another vendor for parts, i never 
actually ordered from them... until tuesday. (shocks, probably the easiest 
thing) after spending about 15 minutes on the phone with a confused employee 
he got the numbers for the shocks i needed. i was instantly sceptical again, 
but had to order, they are about $13 cheaper there than RMM.

got the stuff today and sure enough 2 of the 4 are wrong. called back and 
talked to a woman who again couldn't come up with part numbers for the 
correct shocks. after coming to a conclusion of the correct shocks she said 
she would &quot;make an adjustment in the computer&quot;. what gives, hasn't anyone 
ever ordered KYB's for a '66 bus out there? is it just me and my bad luck? i 
guess &quot;good help is hard to find&quot; was coined for a reason.

sorry to waste more space for my rants, nobody else i know would understand.
