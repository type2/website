This is just my personal experience.

About a year ago i sent a deposit to frank leach on a bus sight unseen.
After 3 months of not receiving a video tape as promised I got a little 
pissed off.
After another three months of constantly bitching for my deposit back and at 
the end finally a THREAT to expose his actions on the web, I received my 
deposit fedexed to me the next day.
Not sure if he was looking to steal from me or just looking for a free 6 
month loan.
Ive heard of frank taking his SWEET time to ship things (like 3-6 months) but 
I have yet to hear of him ripping people off.
I know of a few transactions that took place (YES, I warned them) which went 
smoothly.
I dont think frank is necesarily a crook, but just incredibly lazy.
My friend alex has been to his shop and has extensive video tape (its pretty 
funny I might add). 
The part I dont understand is why he uses so many email addresses and used 
alternate names to post items for sale onto the web?

Im sure theres more.
But its basically made me untrustfull of the ENTIRE state of utah!

&lt;&lt; Just curious what was this guy doing?  Trying to
&quot;..liquidate buses and parts in an unscrupulous way..&quot;
 what exactly does that mean?  Is he selling stolen
parts?  IS he taking money and not sending out items? 


Also, how many emails about this fellow have you
recived?...sounds like just one.  Is this perhaps an
angry customer taking vengence?

Only reason I ask for detail is I 'may' have a deal in
the making with someone who sounds very much like this
person.  I  would like to know more info before I deal
with him any further one way or the other.

Please p-mail me if you wish to keep this off-list.

I appreciate the info!
