Subject: Slow Discharging Battery

My 1966 Westfalia has a battery that goes dead about every two to three
weeks. I drive it nearly every day, usually in the daytime, the generator
light is not coming on, but the battery still goes dead. If I recharge it
the battery will be good for another two weeks or so, but will eventually
become too weak to turn the engine over.
Anyone know what is causing this?
Thanks
John Flowers
