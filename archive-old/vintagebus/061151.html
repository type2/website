Subject: Need &lt;63 door handle 

Hi. Thanks to a reminder from some wonderful person who oh-so-kindly  
removed my tools from my truck, I need to make it completely lockable.
This is a '62 crew cab, and unfortunately the driver's exterior handle
has no lock cylinder in it. So, I need one of those handles,          
preferably with key, but without is ok as well. I also need an early  
ignition switch, as mine is the later style, which has a different    
key. I would like to have the whole truck on 1 key if not too         
expensively possible. I appreciate any leads/offers/etc...            
thanks,
