Help!   after tuning up the 65 over the weekend it ran great .  Today the
oil light went on and off quite a few times.  Oil was at top mark, looked
brand new.  Engine felt hot, couldnt touch the dipstick it was so hot. 
Tonight after everything cooled down I checked the belt tension,seems
fine not loose. removed the oil pressure relief valve the top was stuck
in there so I got it out with a magnet.  there is no thermostat there
wasnt one when I rebuilt the engine.  I tried to drive it tonight on the
freeway it ran great except for the oil light that came on after about 10
minuites.  It was hot.  What do I do?
