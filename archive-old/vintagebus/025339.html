Subject: Shift Rod Separation
Message-ID: &lt;37455EFD.3F60_at_piasanet_dot_com&gt;

Ok, what's the magic technique to separate the shift rod that's just aft
of the  front axle? I drilled out the previously-broken bolt, used a
little penetrant, a little heat and a few choice words, but the rods
won't separate.

I've also tried twisting with a pair of vise grips, that didn't work out
either.

I'm considering marking and cutting the rod in two (I need to take out
the beam) then welding it back in again. Will the rod being shortened
the width of the hacksaw blade affect the shifting after it's all welded
back up?

Just looking for feedback before I perform any half-_at__at_sed repairs on my
bus.
