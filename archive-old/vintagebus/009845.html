Omigod.
So I'm driving home when suddenly bang! The driver's side drops, I see my
tire take off into the neighbour's yard, and my bus slides along on the
pavement.  I steer to the side and stop, look out expecting to see the drum
gone and the backing plate bent to s^*t on the cement.  Instead the drum is
resting on pavement.  To make matters worse, one of the bolts hit another
driver's car and made a big dent in the hood.  So I guess my insurance will
go up.

I managed to find 3 out of the 5 bolts on the ground, all the while thinking
to myself, damn, how could I have forgotten to tighten those up?  How could
I be so stupid?  Put the 3 bolts on, took one out of the other side so I now
have 4 on each front wheel.  Damn.  Then I realize.  I never took those
bolts off at all.  I took off the whole drum and wheel attached on that
side.  Weird.

Pretty scary, but the bus isn't too bad.  Seems to be driving ok, of course
the nice new dogleg on that side is pretty well munched.  &lt;sigh&gt;

thanks 4 listening,
Diana
