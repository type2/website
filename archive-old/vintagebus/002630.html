Well the results are in from the electrolysis and all I have to say is that
it's an overwhelming success.  The water was just saturated with rust,
paint, and metal particles to the point it made it more dense.

Unfortuately, as for the rim, so much rust was pulled off that the true
extent of the damage is revealed and it's a total loss. :-(
=============

Before removing the rim, I turned off the power and sloshed the rim around
to get any residual sediment off.  I pulled out the 4 metal rods and it's
evident they take a ton of the abuse - they are pitted and covered in a
layer of crap about 1/32 of an inch thick.  I would not suggest using
favourite tools like screwdrivers or pipe wrenches - they will get ruined if
you do.

Since the rim was laying flat in the water, the part of the rim normally
covered by a tire, received the best cleaning.  The front and backs of the
rim did blister and give up some paint however.  I took a wire wheel to the
whole rim and it appears that any loose rust is pulled off the rim in the
tank and then any rust that is left behind is turned to the &quot;black stuff&quot;
much like what Extend does or any of those chemicals that neutralize rust.
Any surface that had minimal rust is returned back to its original shiny
luster.  At this time, any &quot;after&quot; pics would be futile as the rim is in
such a bad state, it would surely look like a &quot;before&quot; shot to everyone who
didn't see it before I put it in the tank.  But suffice to say, I'm going to
use this a lot more often.

This method cleaned the rim better than I ever could have with a wire wheel
or brute force.  The only thing better is a sandblaster and I tell you
what - for those of you without sandblasters, this a certainly a viable
alternative.

As for the pictures on the website, yes, it looks like a frankenstein
contraption but it's really simple.

The part to be cleaned is suspended from a chain, hooked to a conductive
piece of pipe.  This is important so that the electrical charge is carried
down thru the part.  I shined up some surfaces on the rim and used bailing
wire to hold the chain on firmly.
Using wire mesh or steel rods (rebar is cool!), you set up electrodes around
the part to be cleaned.  These need to be interconnected so that ALL
electrodes receive a positive charge.  That is what makes my picture look
scary - I'm using a set of jumper cables to hook 3 of the poles together and
a copper wire to connect the 4th.  Most importantly, the part to be cleaned
and the positive electrodes MUST NOT TOUCH or you will short out everything
and it won't work.  Use a little salt, baking soda, and laundry deterget to
aid in the cleaning of the rim.  You'll never forget the smell either - the
water takes on a wangy metallic stench all of its own - it doesn't really
stink - it's just kind of a reminder that &quot;this is not for drinking.&quot;

I hope some of you give this a try - it's kind of a mad scientist approach
to removing rust but it's a lot of fun and it works GREAT!  I'm hooked on
it.
