Last month I sold a 36hp as advertised on this list to
a local for $150.00 ~complete with carb aircleaner and
stale air boxes! Had to almost pay the guy to buy it.
In fact I did bribe him by throwing in a bad 12v
Optima battery with BAP receipt so he could go trade
it in and pay the $70 core charge and get a new one.
