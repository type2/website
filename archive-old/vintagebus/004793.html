Start at the source (power source that is)...... battery. Check terminals,
use some sand paper to clean connections, make sure everything is nice and
clean and that batter holds charge. Then check if there is power at the
ignition switch, cables might be loose there or around your fuse box.....
start there and you should be able to find something (battery and connectors
would be most likely cause).

Good luck,

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; My '70 westy w/ a 1600dp   won't start.  The situation is I drove her this
&gt; afternoon, started, ran no probem, get in her this evening to go to the
&gt; store and nary a click.  no dash lights, nothing.  In reading the idiot
&gt; guide, they take you from  dash  lights on but wont start but I'm not even
&gt; there!  Could this be an ignition switch?  It seems weird that it happened
&gt; out of the blue, no prior sign of impending doom.  I plan on starting
&gt; diagnosis tomorrow &amp; any head start you folks can give me is a  plus!
