Subject: OCIR  Bug In buses or how to have fun racing
CC: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

well I figured this was good for Friday.......

Back In the early 70s  my friend and I had buses that we used to run at the 
Bug-Ins.  For your entry fee you could run the 1/4 mile a couple of times 
plus the Slalom course. 

My bus was a 66 Microbus, 1600cc with one of the first Bugsprays ( the 
previos owner worked for Holley)
anyway the 1/4 mile runs were 19-20 seconds.

My friends bus was a 54 Barndoor panel, it had a Type 3 motor and bug trans, 
lowered all the way around with the widest tires we could find + fit , 
Goodyear Blue streaks which were not exactly street legal but looked cool.
1/4 mile times were a little better but not much.
It drove like a tank....or better a steamroller but it sure was fun in the 
Slalom course !

I think we were the only buses ever to run slalom, they thought we were 
crazy, which we were, but at least we got to run the course 3-4 times which 
was better than just sitting around.  They asked something like &quot;you are not 
going to roll that are ya ?&quot;  

later there was Kawells single cab dragster and a 78 bus (Rick Staler?) that 
would pull  the front wheels off the ground !.......

and later there was the bus boys &quot;worlds fastest bus&quot; at Sacromento 
Bug-O-Rama.......now that was a show...............
