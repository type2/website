Hi Rex,
You can make one real easy if you have a welder, hacksaw and files.  You make 
a wide U-shaped bracket to reach over the pump and its ends touch the engine 
case.  In the center of this bracket drill a 13mm (slightly bigger than 1/2&quot;) 
diameter.  Through this hole goes a bolt with a 7 to 10mm (about 1/4&quot; to 
5/16&quot;) diameter rod welded to the head of the bolt so it forms a T-shape.  
This T-shape often has to be welded on in two pieces at a offset to contact 
both the inlet and outlet ports of the oil pump and still have the bolt 
sticking out straigt on the pump.  The T-shape rod has to be just big enough 
to catch both inlet/outlet passages with enough length and be inserted and 
removed with a slight push to one side and angled out.  Since there are many 
oil pumps with differant sized gear chambers making the T-bolt for each of 
these will be needed to make this tool work for you over the years.  Eric&amp;Barb
PS Loosening the bolts that hold the case halfs together in the area of the 
oil pump is advised to allow a little less tightness of the oil pump in the 
case.  EEE&amp;B
