Subject: Re: [VB] MORE on the Clutch Spring

Sounds like my attempt, except my screwdriver slipped and caught me above
the lip for the total cost of 3 stitches.

Turned out that the clutch spring was a &quot;newer&quot; model than the old requiring
approx 20 - 30 degrees bending to fit..... which of course didn't work.

Remember... Vitamin E oil reduces/eliminates scarring.

Good luck....
