Hello all,

I was just rememberizing that someone had posted about having properly
colored gels for speedo fixin'.  This was during a very busy time for me and
I lost the message.....Hey you out there!  Still got 'em?  What'll it cost
me to get enough gel fragments to redo up three speedos?

Three?  Ya, that's cuz I still want that bashed and battered cumulus blue
deluxe walkthrough for daily driver....I gotta keep up the positive
thinking!

Later..

Gene
