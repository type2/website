Subject: Re: [VB] help--bus won't go!

Get an air cleaner 

and hook up yr preheat.  

Could be a fuel starvation issue.  did you leave the fuel reserve tap on off?  

you can also pull the line off the fuel tap inlet and see if fuel pours out (it should )or nada, or just a dribble.

&gt; soon as i put a load on the engine (come up off the
&gt; clutch) the engine sputters out. I have revs, but no
