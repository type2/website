 Speaking of that big fat red wire, recently I've had my front kick panels
 off (fancy simulated wood grain paneling) and have temporarily been taking
 that wire off of the fuse block as an paranoid anti theft measure.  I plan
 to install a kill switch.  should I wire it to that main hot, or take out
 the ignition switch and wire it to that?  What have people done in the
 past.  I get nervous when I take the DC to the HD and leave it out there all
 alone.

I have not done this, but would wire it in where it is fused.  Hide the 
switch.  dont tell the list where.  Or get a steering lock (I know, more 
work).  You live in So Cal, huh?   Get a steeing lock.  

Hmm I hope you aren't taking the fat red always hot wire off the fuse box.  
that could bump against ground and short out and give YOU a case of the 
crispies to deal with.
