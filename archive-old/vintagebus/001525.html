It makes a big difference if the bumpers are ribbed,
slash, or pointed. And if the trim is for a 23/15 or 21/13

.............

can't see the diff that the number of windows (or lack of) above the
roofline
would make to beltline aluminum. obviously the rear door is significantly
different on &lt;64 and &gt;64 and so is the trim


Same thing.
23/15 = 63 and earlier.
21/13 = 64 and later.
The trim would have ONLY came on one of these deluxes.
