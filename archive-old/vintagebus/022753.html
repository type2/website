Subject: What I did on my BBB weekend...
Mime-Version: 1.0

Wow, okay...colour me green...looks like it was fun!  Finally got almost
all the pictures to download...much thanks for the onsite postings!!  Well,
not to sound moochy or anything, but anyone know if there are extra
t-shirts leftover?  I'll gladly buy one. &lt;grin&gt;

So what did I do with my non-BBB weekend?  Got to spend my Thursday night
with Blitzkrieg VWs (weekly hangout) watching the lunar eclipse.  By 11pm,
I was treated to the soft glow of the full moon reflecting off my dash.
Factor in the 6V dash light and wow, it was cool!

Friday was dry in San Jose, and I took advantage of the weather by getting
one more rim and the front bumper sanded and painted!  I dunno what it is,
but there could be a really rusty, beat up bus...and someone always manages
to paint the rims, bumpers, and hubcap (where applicable).  &lt;shrug&gt;  It
really does make a nice difference.

Saturday was just gorgeous up here and I got the front bumper back on, the
last two rims painted, and the rear bumper off to get cleaned up and
painted.  Wow, that bumper needed some work...so it was off to buy some new
grinding wheels to take almost everything down to bare metal.  Two coats of
primer and paint later and it was ready to come in for the night *and* the
sky was growing dark.  :/  An hour later and it was raining...hasn't
stopped since.  So I still have a rear bumper waiting in my bedroom.  LOL

But I got started on new curtains for the camper!  Picked up a Queen size
bed set in a green and white Buffalo check...rather original looking and I
think I used only half the fitted sheet.  So I have a whole extra sheet and
two pillow covers to use camping!

Okay, so there's my weekend in a nutshell.  Really wish I had been at BBB
4, but count me in for BBB 5!!
