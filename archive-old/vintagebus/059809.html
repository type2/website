Subject: Re: [VB] chicago area vw shops

Rich,

Think about it. Would you rather:

1. Drive 800 miles to Kelly's place, take a plane back to Chi-town and then take a plane back to
Kelly's place to pick it up or ...

2. Give a 2nd or 3rd rate shop a suitcase full of money to get them to start working on your truck
and, &quot;if&quot; they ever decide to actually start working on it, trying to figure-out how you are going
to get enough money to get it out of hock.

Kelly's fast and reasonable. Well worth the plane fare to NC.

&gt; While I will agree completely with your recommendation, I feel it's
&gt; prudent to point out the roughly 800 miles that separate them...
&gt;
&gt; There is someone on the list that specializes in VW restoration work and
&gt; he's damn good. I know because, I've been to his shop. His name is Kelly
&gt; Brown and you can't see pictures of his work at www.metwiz_dot_com
