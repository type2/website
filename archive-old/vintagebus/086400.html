Subject: Maiden Voyage alert South Carolina

Hershel and his wife came to pick up the 77 transporter and take it home.
Hershel told me on the phone that he was bringing a trailer.  They showed up
sans trailer.  The longest distance shakedown I've taken in it was 20 miles
and I am posting so if someone is along his route and wishes to volunteer
possible assistance in case he runs into trouble.

From junkyard to roadtrip is a bit of a stretch for any vehicle, unless you
are on Lost! (the TV show).
