I think I may have found a set of early westy aluminum cups.  I found a set
of the small shot glasses.  There are six of them, in various colors, and
they are marked &quot;Made In Germany&quot; on the bottom.

Are these westy cups?

Also, anyone know what these puppies are worth, if they are westy cups?
These are NOS still wrapped in tissue paper.

Thanks,
Christen Christian
