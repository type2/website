Hi Isaac,
When it stalled six times what was the engine doing?  Reving up,  slowing 
down, idling, etc..?  Which distributor are you using?  Does  the distributor 
advance drop fast enough?  If not the inner  parts of the distributor might need 
removing and new grease. 
  Might be you need to clean the distributor again.  That can  easily take 
two or three cleanings to get the last crud out.
