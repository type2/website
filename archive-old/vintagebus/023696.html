Subject: The Ark Goes backwards!

Hey Y'all!
The Ark does indeed move in both directions!  I discovered I've been
driving
F*rds too long.  I was assuming a F*rdish shift pattern with reverse all
the
way RIGHT and back.  Of course, F*rd is backwards to how it SHOULD be! 
So I
thank the very kind folks who sent on ways to make the Ark go
backwards.  I
will still apply proper lubricants to all the right places, since she
had
been sitting for 5 years.

As usual, I overlooked the simplest solution.

My plates will be here soon.  (there ws a recent post about trying to
get
your ve-hikkle inspected here in Ct.  The guy wasn't lying!)  I'll be
southbound
soon so where I register don;t seem too important.

Installed fan for external oil cooiling system, been chasing electrical
gremlins
and generally enjoying the hell out of working on something that doesn't
require a masters in computer science, mastery of arcane rituals, or an
extra 
elbow in the forearm.

My, but how easily I forgot the simple pleasures of wrenching towards
simplicity
instead I'd been chasing that elusive siren of technology.
