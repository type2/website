No the bug linings are different then the BD, a lot of the Barndoor brakes

you find are actually bug brakes due to the unavailability of BD cores.

Early bug brakes will work but the shoes are a little narrower. Was told

this by a person in the know! I guess I could use bug brakes, but why

sacrifice the little stopping power they allready (BD) have.

I had got new  shoes for my 53 that were out of a VW dealership.  (there are 
early and late barndoor shoes, mine takes the earlier version)    I have the 
old shoes that were on the bus when I got it.   I believe I compared them to 
68 bug shoes and the pads were the same, though the shoe (the metal part- 
hope I have the terms right)   the metal part was different.  Think I will 
check again.   Now I am curious.  In either case, I am sure they could be 
relined for spares.    Yes barndoors do not have brakes like new cars at 
all!!!!!   My 69 bug has better brakes- same size wheel cylinders (front uses 
same rebuild kit), larger shoes, lighter vehicle!!!
