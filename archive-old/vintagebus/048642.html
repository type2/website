Subject: 009 again...What's Up with this thing?!?!?!
Message-Id: &lt;mR/10L7Ou-0001nhR_at_mail.airmail_dot_net&gt;

So, what is the reason we see 009 disty's in every car in HotVW's &amp; VW
trends, as well as being the only disty offered in ALL of the &quot;bigger&quot; mail
order houses? I follow the logic of the vacume advance distributor &amp; I've
seen MANY problem posts here &amp; on the VW newsgroups where the culprit ends
up being the 009. And the people that like the 009 always had to make
numerous adjustments just to get it to work the way it should out of the
box. That doesn't make sense to me. 

I'm guessing the reason for the popularity has to do with the praises of
the 009 in the Idiot book. Another reason may be that dealers might get
these things REAL cheap due to volume production &amp; buying (stocking).

I don't know much about disty's, but I do know that way back when I had a
super beetle &amp; needed help working on the engine, my friend &quot;in the know&quot;
insisted I put a 009 in there. &quot;It'll give you more power!&quot; he says. Being
the young buck that I was, I agreed that &quot;that would be cool!&quot;. After
getting the engine back together, the car never really ran the same. I
ended up having to shoot a lot of gas into the carb to get rid of the flat
spot. The car didn't really have more power. I never &quot;got it&quot; then that it
was the 009. Only after getting into the age of the internet &amp; seeing other
peoples experiences did I reflected back to realize that 009 was exactly
the problem.

I guess i'm just confused why this is THE disty of choice. Any ideas?
