&gt;Empi and a couple other companies make the oil filter pump, but I don't
&gt;recall any &quot;O&quot; ring, only the regular thin paper gasket. I have a few of
&gt;these pumps, most for the pre 71 cam without the deep dish, and none of
&gt;them had an &quot;O&quot; ring. Maybe an Empi only mod to the basic pump?


berg has pumps with o-rings (i have one) - but they go AROUND the 
pump body where it fits into the engine case , NOT between the face 
of the pump and the pump cover. that circular slot in the face of the 
pump is there to relieve pressure on the cover if i recall 
correctly...
did the empi pump have a small groove milled arounf the pump's circumference?
