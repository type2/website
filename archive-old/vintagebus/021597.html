&gt; Hey Split Nosers,
&gt; 
&gt;   For some odd reason I thought the What-Not cabinet was the cabinet on
&gt; the left side rear when you open the cargo door.  [If not, what is that
&gt; pieces name?] It can not funtion that well in a bus that has the spare
&gt; tire well, cause that is its bottom floor.


That cabinet in the rear left corner I call the corner cabinet.   They did not put them in the walk through westys, because of the spare tire location.  Just in the bench seat westys.   Nice place to put stuff you want easily acessable from the bed when you are camping.  

The whatnot cabinet aka spice rack is what I take to mean the shelf unit on the rear cargo door.  Cargo doors meaning the two doors on the side of the bus, not the one on the back of the bus, which could be called the rear hatch. 

 hope that makes sense.


Clara
