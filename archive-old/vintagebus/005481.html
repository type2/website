&gt; any way, to the problem, it shifts well and doesn't grind, but right
&gt; after you let out the clutch it makes kind of a clunking sound in the rear
&gt; end. you can almost feel it( or that part could be in my head) trany
mounts
&gt; arent new, but they seem solid. PO said some one told him it had something
to
&gt; do with the shocks or the splines on the axels.

Probably a broken tranny mount. Most times you can't tell by looking at
them. You can pry with a lever and see if there is any movement, especially
up in the nose cone mount. Best to just replace them, the brake hoses, the
engine compartment seal, and the swing axle boots while it is all out. Yes
it is a pain, but it needs to be done before you thrash your shift coupling
and possibly the nose cone. I would make sure the nuts on the rear axles are
good and tight just as a matter of course. Could be some slop in the
splines, but the clunk you describe is the forward tranny mount 99.9999% of
the time and it is not improving the bus as time goes on.
