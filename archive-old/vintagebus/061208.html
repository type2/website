Subject: RE: [VB] Bus F S/ peoples attitudes 

Hey Ed,
 No offense taken! It is only through debate that one
can form an opinion! Right? 
 I guess &amp;#34;priced fairly&amp;#34; is open to
interpretation! It would only be the sellers
responsibility to lower the price if the vehicle would
not sell. I have seen a lot of busses for sale that
are incomplete, have the wrong parts on them but are
presented as &amp;#34;restored&amp;#34;. 
 I wrote in my post that I agreed with you on selling
prices unless the seller was selling the vehicle as
OBO. Wouldn't you agree that in that situation there
is room for negotiations? That would not be an option
were the bus listed as &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34;.
 If the seller has made the agreed upon deductions in
the price and the buyer still fails to purchase the
car than I agree the buyer has proven to be dishonest.
My point is that if the market dictates that a bus is
worth $8000 albeit missing most of it's original
parts, than so be it. It only increases the value of
my complete Westy! 
 It is, in my opinion, important to remember that if a
buyer pays a good chunk of money for a less than
steller bus he is STILL an idiot and not the seller
(who has the upper hand in most transactions). Isn't
there a saying about a fool and his money...on the
flip side I don't think I am too far off when I say
that there are quite a few sellers who offer vehicles
at a VERY high price. Either way it is really a
personal decision as to what a fair price is.
