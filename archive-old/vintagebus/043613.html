&gt;I knew that the brake lights went thru the box, but didn't think they 
&gt;would affect hazards.

Not directly, but the box does hijack that wire to flash the rear
lamps when required.  However, messing with the brake lights allows you
to check out the turn signal switch, which I think might be your problem.

&gt;I'll try shorting the terminals on the brake switches for the tests 
&gt;(that'll work won't it?).

Yep.  Short both terminals on either switch to one another.  To keep
from crawling under all the time, run a couple of extension wires up
through the brake fill hole and use those instead.  :) 

&gt;And that is a darn good writeup you did, I might add!

Thanks!  For those just joining us, that URL again is
