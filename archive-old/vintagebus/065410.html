You don't know the half of it...

&gt; So the question is, is there a site or good book reference that explains how 
&gt; to set these up properly?  Seeing as I need to do the bus in a few weeks.

Rennlist_dot_com has an article written by Will Ferch which explains some of 
this, but only to the detail of understanding spring rates, tosion bar
lengths and what not - he doesn't touch upon why you would choose certain
bars for certain apps, and since we don't have any other bar sizes available,
that's a good thing.  Will and I collaborated on a spring plate angle
calculator for the 911 - http://vintagebus_dot_com/cgi-bin/spring.cgi  Plug in
your car's weight, which bars you're using, and it spits out the unloaded
spring plate angle.  From my personal experience, and from feedback from
others who have used the calculator, it is *very* accurate.  For the purposes
of setting a bus' spring plates, use the Bentley and maybe fudge a degree
or so higher to account for sag.

&gt; Also there is some angle meter ruler thing that is supposed to help, but I 
&gt; have never seen one...  Is this necessary?  Are they redily available?
