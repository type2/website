&gt; has anyone tried one fo those drop in electronic ignition modules on a 6v
&gt; engine? I asked the local
&gt; shop, and they seemed to think it couldn't be done,

There are 6v versions made of electronic ignitions. My Crane XR700 could be
ordered in 6v or 12v.

Sorry Kevin - I don't know of an electronic ignition that will work on a 6V
system. Thanks for considering CompuFire though.

Which component are we talking about? The CD-style ignition piece, or the
points replacement? The points replacement doesn't care what the voltage is,
it's just a fancy switch.

*****************
I was hoping to install one of those things that goes inside the distributor
and replaces the points. Compu-fire says no go... I assumed it was just a
switch type asemmbly, and voltage would ot matter...i will try to look into
the crane model. who sells the crane xr700? is this something that can fit in
the distributor? Basically i am trying to get something to replace the points
so i don't have to adjust them anymore, i am not looking for some big
performance gain(most people have told me there is not much of a performance
gain anyway.

thanks
kevin
