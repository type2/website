For all you gauge fanatics out there I am installing an array of senders in
my new 1776 single port

oil temp pickups, 1 at bypass, 1 at oil pressure switch point and if I feel
like it I will install the type 3 oil cooler with a pick-up there also.
Should I add a dipstick also?? to get readings from different areas of
engine.

oil pressue switchs,  1 at oil pressure switch point and another at the type
3 oil cooler, this should show me pressure in and out of cooler.

cylinder head temp gauge, at number 3 cylinder and if I feel rich I'll
install another at number 1, good for cross reference.

air mixture sender (CB Performance) installed in exhust before muffler.

Tach, so I'll know my RPM's to tell what temps and air fuel mixtures are at
what RPM's

Vac gauge, so I can see how engine vac affects temps under different loads.

now if only one of you computer people will only write some software so all
this could be recorded on a laptop, pluged into accessory cig lighter.

guess I should also put in an outside temp gauge so that outside ambiant
temps would also be recorded along with engine stats.
