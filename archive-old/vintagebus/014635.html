 &gt;the lever shock is attached to the bus with two big bolts.  an arm goes
 over to the RGBox and attached to a thingy that bolts through the spring
 plate.
 installation should be the reverse of removalbut getting to the top big bolt
 is a real PITA.   very inaccessable.
 &gt;
 I undid mine by removing the wheel and going at it from over the top of the
 spring plate with Mr. box wrench.
 
 Don't forget the lock plate!  ;)
 
 That reminds me that I stil need to find/repro the little curvy plates that
 go from the lever shock arm to the redux box special bolt.  Hmmm, I wonder
 what it feels like to drive with rear shocks hooked up.
 
 Did you know there's a lock plate for lower front shock mount too?  Most of
 those seem to have been broken off...

STill haven't got the fronts off, guess it'll be a while.  I do have at least 
one extra curvy thing for the rear shock.  Did you rebuild or replace yours, 
and do you know about getting seals for the arm, cause after after I put them 
in  well I drove it around yeasterday morning and then it dripped from 
thearms jack oil plink plink on the garage floor POS.

ya now I look at the workshop manual they say to change them with the wheel 
off.

parts list does not list the seal that is bad and leaking, workshop manual 
says to replace if bad.  hm.

re the change of part number systems I figured that they changed late 53 as 
my 6/53 made bus has the old style, while I have seen early 54s with the late 
style system.  So I am surprised you 55 has the 29.xx style.  go figure.
