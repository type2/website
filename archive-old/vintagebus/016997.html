Michael,

You are so correct.  I drive a firetruck occasionally
(I'm a volunteer firefighter), and we are trained on
how to handle 20+ ton vehicles.  Our heavy rescue tips
the scales at about 18.5 tons with no riders.  Once
you add 8 big ass firefighters, that's another 3/4
ton.  Nothing at all like driving a bus that weighs
about 1.5 tons with riders and gear.  The engine brake
is a &quot;Jake&quot; (short for Jacobs) brake.  With the right
resonators (read no mufflers) on the vehicle, it makes
quite a loud noise.  It is so loud that if we are not
travelling faster than 25 mph, we have to leave it
off, other than there being no reason cuz the Jake
brake won't do much good going that slow.  I guess
that's mostly for residential areas.

Congrats on the CDL!

Paul

&gt; The reason the sign is stated that way is for LARGE
&gt; trucks.  This means 
&gt; tractor trailers.  If you are on a downgrade in a
&gt; semi and you only use your 
&gt; brakes, the brakes will heat up REALLY quick (like
&gt; less than 30secs) and you 
&gt; will lose all braking power.  The diesel engine in a
&gt; tractor trailer has 
&gt; engine brakes.  The engine brakes use the
&gt; compression of the engine to slow 
&gt; the truck down.  Buy using the engine brakes in a
&gt; low gear and &quot;stab&quot; 
&gt; braking you can safely manuever down a steep
&gt; downgrade.  (stab braking is 
&gt; slowing your vehicle 5mph below a safe speed,
&gt; letting the truck gain speed 
&gt; to your safe operating speed, then applying the
&gt; brakes again to lower the 
&gt; speed 5 mph)  The stab braking technique with the
&gt; engine brakes will give 
&gt; the brake pads and rotors time to cool down between
&gt; use.
