&lt;&lt;how hard is it really to change out the glass later if you find the right
stuff, esp on things like the front side windows where you could just bolt
in an entire 64+ frame as you seek out that rare 57 glass...  4 big screws
and yer switched over...

Actually its one HARD to remove cotter pin (probably break the bakalite bezel)
About 20 or so theet metal screws. 2 big phillips screws (which like to strip 
out) for 14mm bolts, two 10mm nuts, four six mm bolts,,,, =)

Why not do it right the first time?
Is this stuff that HTF????
