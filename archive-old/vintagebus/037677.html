Subject: steering/front end probs
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello list,
I've got a few questions and have very little experience w/ front ends in 
general...
The steering in my 59 panel is pretty bad... It's all over the road.
The steering wheel has some play in it. The bus likes to steer itself. I can 
compensate for it, but would really love a solid drive! I know this could be 
a multitude of things, but want to know your opinions / tips, before I order 
a rebuilt steering box!
Thanks alot----
Also what are the best shocks for my bus... I want a soft/ comfortable ride 
(or at least as close to one as I can get w/ my '59...
Thanks,
Pete
