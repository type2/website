Subject: VW 297-Ring gear adjusting tool 4 sale

If anyone is looking for a VW297 or other TRANS tools, please email me.
I am still going through the tools, and only a few will be available.
Since I do not look to work on transmissions, and have a freshly rebuilt
one, I'd rather have a good person own this rather than sit on a shelf
for years. In wood box, complete. Please make offer.
Thanks,
Al
