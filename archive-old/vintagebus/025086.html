&gt;         Tried to remove the outside window-to-door frame rubber last night

&gt; stuck in the channel. I figure I'd better learn to properly remove and
&gt; install rubber pretty quick. Any suggestions, tips and necessary tool
&gt; recommendations would be appreciated.

I've done a few of these and found a couple tricks.
First, the slot that the rubber rides in is pinched at each end, but not
so much anywhere else, assuming it hasnt been pinched by banging around
too much. Use a dull screwdriver to open up the end pinches just a bit,
and any other &quot;aftermmarket&quot; pinches. :)
With the help of a little glycerin ( Thanks here to Eric and Barb) that
you can get cheap at a pharmacy, soften up the rubber and try to just
slide the strip out.

I had one door frame that was a particular b*#ch, and used a razor to
slice the rubber lengthwise, letting the blade slide diagonally into the
track, and thereby cutting the strip into two strips, one of which I
could tear out, and leave the other looser.

Heat always makes rubber more pliable. A warm day is nicer for
installing and removing rubber.

A hot tank at the local machine shop, or home-made tsp tank a la Hoover
will take care of small bits of rubber as well as paint.

Good luck!
