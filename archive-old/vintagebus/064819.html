Subject: Re: [VB] 66 Westy restoration pictures are up.

I see bunches of vans in worse condition with run of the mill engines and
drives for more money on most of the Westy For Sale Sites.
My main concern is to sell a bus that I know to be safe and dependable.
I see an easy $2500.00 in the engine / drive / coolers / 12v upgrade so
that makes the bus a steal at $1,000.00
I leave the body work and miscellaneous to the new owners.
You can believe one thing ................. I'm going to put some miles
on it while waiting to sell it.
This thing runs like a racehorse and is twice as agile as my 5300 pound
83 Westy so I'm going to have a good time with it.
I've also got a 77 Combi with a Type IV 2000cc coming my way.
Texas isn't a good market for VW Busses or Westies so I'll have to buy
the 77 at a parts car price.

Stan
