This continues last night's post where I abruptly stopped due to just being
too tired to continue.

After setting the bus back down on the ground, I noticed just how low it
sat.  After seeing the front end perched in the air for the past month, it
just seemed so low when I took it down.  About this time my grandfather came
out in the shop and he was volunteered to pilot the bus while I pushed it
out of the garage so we could do a 3 point turn in the alley.  Somewhere in
all of this I chucked several pounds of dirt and rust bits into the trash
after sweeping up.  I blocked the bus, got the rear end on jack stands, took
off the rear tires and proceeded to have one helluva time getting the axle
nuts loose.  The ebrake helped some but I finally ended up using a big piece
of c-channel with a hole drilled in it.  I bolted it to the drum.  Next came
the torch, the quenching in WD40 with thick white smoke, and then me with
with big Bertha (5' cheater), socket, and sliding t-handle in 3/4 drive.  I
put my 300 pound mass on the end of the 5 foot cheater and that axle nut
would not budge!  My first attempts with the tire on resulted in the tire
simply spinning on the cement floor.  Somewhere in all of this a pipe wrench
sailed over my head and traveled about 10 feet - hitting the shop door and
scaring my grandfather.  This time,  I got a beefier but shorter cheater,
used the floor jack to support the socket, and went at it.  I jumped so hard
on that pipe while grabbing the drip gutter with my finger tips that I
thought I was going to break the t-handle.  My grandfather just said, &quot;I
don't care - if it breaks, I'll just get another one.&quot;

So imagine this:  A 300 pound 6'2&quot; tall guy jumping on a cheater pipe.  The
nut was forced to bow in humiliation and with a loud &lt;SNAP&gt; I was slowly
lowered to the ground on the cheater.  It took a few more hits of my 1500+
pound wailing before that nut gave up the fight.  I put a nasty bend in the
sliding t-handle and when I showed my grandfather, he just got this big grin
on his face.  I guess he was happy that I won. The other axle nut took just
as much force to get it off.

Well that did me in for the night.  I was really tired so I picked up the
tools, swept the shop, and had some ice tea with grandma while we watched
the news and discussed Elian's plight.  Time to head for home at 10:45p.m.

All fer now...
