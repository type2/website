Subject: Re: [VB] Double Cab Bed Floors, and Double Cab parts Help.

Yep, the 2nd dome light is above the rear window, and is triggered by
the toggle switch on the left side of the speedo pod.  I was just at a
VW show in NE Maryland yesterday that had 2 doublecabs, and neither of
them had the 2nd dome light.  The owners didn't realize this because the
POs had also rewired the toggle switch position for other things--like
switching an aux. heater fan in the heater duct.  The dome light is the
same assembly as the other one mounted overhead.

The rear seat ashtray is mounted on the drivers side of the seat divider
bulkhead.  Its chromed and slides into a chrome base.  Its the same kind
that you would see on passenger buses.  I have a '67; don't know if they
were on all years or not.

&gt; &gt; 4.  Hold-down brackets, bolts, and wing nuts for the rear seat base
&gt; &gt; 5.  You should have 2 dome lights (sometimes one is missing), and an
&gt; &gt; ashtray in the back seat
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm.  Is the light above the rear window?  I have what looks to be a dealer
&gt; installed box speaker in that position.
&gt; 
&gt; Where does the ash tray go?  My panels where replaced by the PO with
&gt; paneling.  Were they on all years?
