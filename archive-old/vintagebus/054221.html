Subject: 8mm square socket follow up

I thought I would post a follow up in case anyone was interested. I looked all over the place to find a 4 point (square) 8mm socket for the screws which hold the shift coupler on the shift rods. Snap On has one, if you can find them. The next best thing, which several people pointed out, was to go to Sears. For $2.99, they have a 5/16&quot; 8 point socket (3/8 drive) that fits nearly perfectly, and removed both the bolts quite easily after I sprayed them several times with PB Blaster.
Thanks for all ther replies and tips. My sympathies to several of you who replied with horror stories of broken bolts and cut and rewelded shift rods.
BTW, the front tranny mount on the truck, which caused this project, was completely sheared in two. You'd think they could make rubber last at least 40 years. sheesh.
:)
