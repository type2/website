Hi Craig,
What is your crankshaft diameter measuring at #2 bearing  surface?  If it is 
at the high side it might need to be ground a  few 1/10,000&quot; less.  
  To measure the thickness of the bearing you need a roller bearing to  seat 
inside the bearing and measure the two together with a  0-1&quot; micrometer.  Then 
minus the roller bearing diameter, for the  bearing thickness measurement.
  In a pinch (pun intended) you could try fine honing grit to polish  the 
bearing with the crankshaft in it, but there is the risk of  later having it 
seize up if you do not remove enough material.
