&gt; I'd like to see that pod!

No probs.
I'll post a link as soon as I get home from work.
The way things stand with my '67 panel, the gas guage
on it has been busted.
It has no glass &amp; the needle is missing as well.
I'm considering blocking the hole with a flat metal
plate behind &amp; putty on top, sanding it to contour to
the dash &amp; then using a VDO or Speco aftermarket unit
in the roof pod.
Thing is, the pod already will have oil temp &amp;
pressure guages, a volt meter &amp; a tacho so I think it
may get a little crowded.
The tacho is likely to be bigger than the 2 &amp; 1/16
inch guages &amp; so the pod will probably have to bulge
in one place to fit it, which will look tres' cool but
take up room.
Now all I need to fit is the switches &amp; bezel lights
for the retro rockets, landing gears and auto pilot &amp;
then I can use that little bunk in the back while on
long cross country trips..........
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
