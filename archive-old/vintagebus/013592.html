Subject: Crazy Front Hood Trim Question
Message-ID: &lt;19991007002348.14147.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Fellow List Members:

I am searching for a front hood chrome strip for my 57 Baja Bug. Being a 
Baja with a Bug Eye kit, it requires a much shorter chrome strip than one 
would find on a stock Bug.

I am looking for a piece that is 21 inches end to end and has the rounded 
off points on each end. Just like a stock early chrome strip only shorter.

Does anyone out there know of a piece of VW trim that fits this description? 
Something from a Ghia, Bus, Type 3 etc. I doubt if the stock piece can be 
shortened in any way.

Thanks,
Skid
