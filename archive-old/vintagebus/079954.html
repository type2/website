Subject: replacment Safari Wiper Shafts and compete units

Still working on getting some replacment shafts for my
safari wiper unit.  Looks like i will have them this
week.  I will have a few extra sets if anyone is
interested.

Unfortionalty it looks like by bad unit my be too far
gone to repair.  I think the front brass bushing may
be shot as well.  That being said, anyone have any
compete units FOR SALE?  
thanks

Matt
