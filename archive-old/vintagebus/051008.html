&gt; balancers and held up what I would swear was an adaptor.  Said they got them
&gt; in from time to time.  We are talking the spin balancers now and not the old
&gt; school bubble balancers.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, you may ask, is where was I?  COSTCO of all places.  So, if you are
&gt; near one of these outfits you might want to wander into the tire shop and
&gt; see if they have an adaptor.  The fellow in the Vallejo, CA store said he
&gt; thought all the COSTCO tire shops had them but he wasn't certain.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;I just got some new all season Michelins on my DC recently at Costco, and they
couldn't balance them cuz they did not have an adapter.  Other than that,
the service was great, the price  even better.  This was in Salt Lake City.
