Subject: Partial 12 volt conversion

&gt; Does anyone on the list have experience with this partial 12V conversion?

There's no sense in this at all. Take the money you would save on buying a 
six volt battery, buy a 12 volt battery and change your light bulbs. From 
there add a 12 v flasher and wiper adaptor, and you're about there. 6 volt 
starter is okay running at 12 volts.
