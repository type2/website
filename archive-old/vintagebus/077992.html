Subject: [busalert] Stolen '82 Diesel Vanagon Westphalia

Vehicle:  1982 VW Diesel Westphalia

Location stolen from:  Monroe St., about 1/2 a block from Oak St.,
Napa, CA.

Details concerning theft:  Vehicle was stolen during the period of
Nov. 1 to Nov. 11.  (I was out of town on vacation.  When I returned
from my vacation on the 11th, I noticed it missing.  I immediately
contacted the Napa Police Dept. and reported it as a stolen
vehicle.)  They assured me that there was no record of it having been
towed by city/or other type of towing/impound yards, at least, to the
best of their knowledge.

License Number:  1GBV183 with current registration, expiring Sept.
2004(The Sept. tag is faded &amp; hardly legible)

Vehicle ID Number:  WV2ZG0250CH072691

Vehicle Color:  Light Yellow with a white Westphalia Top(Westphalia
emblem is worn off of the front.

Other distinguishing marks:  Alloy wheels(from an '89 Carat) with
Winston 175/R14 tires, Silver &quot;Deluxe&quot; Wraparound bumpers(fiberglass,
I believe.  These also came off of an '89 Vanagon GL/Carat from a
Pick'n'Pull in Oakland.)  The grill &amp; headlight assembly had also
been replaced with a newer version from '86 - '91.  A little orange
stuffed monkey(sunfaded to almost yellow) sat in the passenger's side
front of the dash.  The curtains are very sunfaded.  The interior was
complete with sink, stove, refrigerator, 2 swingaway table tops, and,
of course, the 2 front seats.  I also had extra trim stored inside
the Van, as well as the front spoiler(from an '89) which I hadn't yet
mounted.  Rear license plate frame read Val Strough, Albany.  There
was a clear plastic cover over it to discourage theft of the
registration tags.  Very minor damage to side sliding door, &amp; also,
passenger front by parking light.  Poptop tent has a big rip/tear in
it on the passenger's side.  Seal on the poptop(rear) part of the
camper is missing.
View from back reveals:  Vanagon L, diesel. Also, Broken antenna,
and, trim missing.

If anyone has any information regarding the whereabouts of this
vehicle, please contact either me or the police.  Thanks!  As far as
a reward is concerned, we can discuss that later . . . I will be very
grateful to get my van back!

Thanks, Diesel Jim
