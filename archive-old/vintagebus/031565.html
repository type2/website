Subject: Re: [VB] They came and took my bus away :(

 &gt; Should I paint the aluminum on the Jealousy windows or just
 &gt; clean it up?

I used plain old brillo pads on mine and they came out great! A lot of
elbow grease(mine were way way bad) but worth the effort. Has been a few
weeks and they have not diminished in luster.

Also recieved many suggestions about how to keep the RAT BASTARDS out of
my bus. Many thanks. . . I needed the cheery responces. Someone
suggested a plastic jesus, which was quite a good idea, but it caused me
to think. . . hmmm. . . perhaps a hula girl would work well too. I can't
imagine a hula girl would appeal to the RAT BASTARDS or else they would
have already turned Osama in for the 5 million smackaroos and would have
parked themselves in Hawaii with a few Mai Tai's and a couple hula
girlies of their own. :)

Your racist pal (TIC),
Lester
