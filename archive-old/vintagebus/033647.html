Subject: RE: [VB] 019 distributor

  The 019 are what came stock in 356 Porsche, I do not have the year break
down for them (in Porsche) but the advance curve is set up in them for
higher rpm's. I have found them to work good in an air cooled VW but the
total advance seems to be more around 3500-4000 RPM. They work excellent in
my screemer rpm engines

ps. If your out there Jim enlighten the list on these

Subject: [VB] 019 distributor


i just put a 019 centrifugal distributor in my bus and i have a question
about timing it.  in order for me to get it to advance to 30, it has to be
set at 15 btdc at idle.  can this be right, or is something wrong?  thanks!
