It does sound sketchy - you don't have &quot;gaskets&quot;! 

Also, a new set of Pistons and Cyliners is a little over $100 - just
replace 'em.  Re-welding the head probably isn't going to buy you much - is
this single port or dual port?

&gt;Well, I took the heads to the machine shop, and it looks like a broken gasket
&gt;is the problem with #3.  Unfortunately, the other head is cracked.  Both
heads
&gt;have been rebuilt before, and they say they might be able to fix the cracked
&gt;head.  Is this sketchy?
