Subject: Another silly 67' Master Cylinder Question..

Hi, All! 

I have appreciated the helpfulness from everyone that sent me a response. 
This afternoon I bled and adjusted the brakes, still nothing. So, I checked 
the MC pushrod. Here is where I need the help: There is a lock nut right in 
front of the rubber boot on the rod itself. This nut was tightened all the 
way to the very end of the rod. I adjusted this nut downward toward the 
rubber boot and viola!, the pedal is back up and feels very firm. Was this 
the correct thing to do? Basically I elimated the travel that the rod had in 
it, so now it contacts the MC much sooner. I'm a big novice here, so please 
bear with me. :-) I just want to make sure I am not doing anything wrong, as 
these are the brakes we are talking about. :)  Thanks so much once again...

Cheers,
-Justyn
