&gt;&lt;&lt; What color was the front turn signal inner lens for 1962 and 1963 model
&gt;year
&gt; USA spec splitties? &gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi Tom,
&gt;Good question.  Our 1962 SO-34 has clear, and our 1963 (DEC 62) has yellow
&gt;signals that are painted yellow inside.  Pretty sure these are the originals
&gt;for these two.   Eric&amp;Barb

I beleive that the colour of the turn signal is dependent on the 
different laws in diferent countries. My Swedish bus from 1961 had 
the amber tinted bullet signals, but I take it hthat the same model 
to North American had the clear signals. I quess if you want that 
euro look you'll need the tint.
