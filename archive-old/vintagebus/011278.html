Subject: dormobile tragedy/busses for sale

--part1_18.126f2201.28d7760f_boundary

In light of recent tragedies I almost feel guilty mentioning my recent 
disaster.
On Saturday the 8th of Sept we had a pretty big fire here at the Olsen home.  
The garage burned, moving into the house.  My 69 Dormobile was a total 
loss(uninsured for fire).  My newly acquired 99 Harley 1200 sportster sport 
was in the garage along with all my tools, a used 1600cc dp I had just sold 
for a Carmen Ghia, and too many other items to list.  Our interior contents 
are considered a total loss by the insurance company and the structure will 
likely be rebuilt from the framing.
I have posted some pix at: http://photos.yahoo_dot_com/olyolsen13mt  choose the 
fire folder.  
If anyone has some leads on a 68-71 camper, prefer a dormobile,(I know I'm 
dreaming)  in the $1500-$3500 range I'd appreciate it.  Rust free with bad or 
no motor works for me as the 1700cc SP I built this fall was untouched by the 
fire in the bus.
I can arrange pick/transport from LA/Pheonix or Seattle/PNW.  I'll look at 
later bay windows as well but prefer the older bays.
thanks in advance for any suggestions
