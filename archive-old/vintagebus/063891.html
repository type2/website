Subject: Re: [VB] Lowered Bus Question

Why not start a mailing list called &quot;Vintagebus, well not really&quot; or &quot;Vintagebus, but I really
wanted a Civic&quot; ?

Let me start with I ENJOY this group and get tons of help from it.  But I
hate when this comes up, lowering.  Everyone wants to jump in with keep it
stock.  You know what, it's there's, my money, and we (I) should be able to
do it like we want and still get opinions.  Isn't that what owning a driving
Buses are about, being different then everyone else?
