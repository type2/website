hmmm somehow the task of; &quot;Repainted that spot on my rear left corner that i
stripped for no reason&quot; was left off your list! how could this happen?! you
even had your paint out!
Im currently forming a club in support of overtaking your BD and spraying
that spot with primer against your will.
any interested partys can pmail me.

&gt;In &quot;Everett's Kombi&quot; news, I was bored last weekend so I hand painted a VW
Planet logo on my Bus, I'll post a picture when I can. I haven't done much
recently, a lot of little stuff, I:
&gt;o Rebuilt and installed the &quot;correct&quot; 54-55 36hp fuel pump
&gt;o Installed a &quot;correct&quot; battery positive cable to replace my garden
hose-wrapped zero gauge POS.
&gt;o Repainted the fuel tank and spare tire tray black and installed the
&quot;correct&quot; Barndoor fuel tap.
&gt;o Someone offered me a nice Barndoor rear reflector, unfortunately the stud
on the back broke off so I disassembled one of my busted glass ones and
swapped the rears.
&gt;o Attempted to improve the quality of my front seat by installing some
couch-style springs over my busted original springs, it actually worked
pretty well but anybody got a '54-'55 Barndoor lower front bench seat? I had
one that I considered sold to me for the past 5 months but the guy changed
his mind, I hate that.
&gt;o Installed some nicer ribbed-bumper splash pans I picked up at Pomona a
while back.  Rear bumper is nice and tight now.
