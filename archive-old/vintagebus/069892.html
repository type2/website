Subject: Re: [VB] car shows... i'm bummed

I agree. Most shows are done by noon, but maybe it's a way to get you to drop a little more green at vendor booths or in the swap. 
On another subject, If you do set up a &quot;display&quot; in the swap let people know it is a display. I get irritated at some swappers who put out a bunch of stuff and when you ask about it you get, &quot; That? Oh, thats a '67 NOS ambulance fan that i found at a local dealership and blah, blah, blah. It's for display only i'm never going to  be selling it.&quot;  My feeling is that if your not selling it leave it at home or at least in your car if you are swapping. I walk the swap looking for parts, not to hear braggards tell me how cool they are. But then again I might be easily irritated!?

To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other.
