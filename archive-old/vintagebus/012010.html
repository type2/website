I was wondering about this taking apart of the speedo.

I recently purchased the little bits of film to cover the lights in my bus speedo. You know the red, blue, and green little lenses. Anyway I was told it was a pretty easy fix, I just haven't got to it yet.  But now there is a warning about not taking apart the speedo.

My speedo works fine, and so do the lights, I just wanted to make it look right. Has anyone done a similar repair? Any suggestions, or things to be aware of.

Thanks.
