&gt;My attitude towards the whole thing is that in the end, the vehicle is a
&gt;thing, an object. One associated with memories and experiences, mind you,
&gt;but all in all a thing that can be eventually replaced.  There are a lot
&gt;more important things to worry about than to spend countless hours and
&gt;sleepless nights wondering if your vehicle is still sitting outside your
&gt;house.
&gt;
Hmmm, &quot;eventually replaced&quot;  You can replace a dead dog, too, but it's not
the same.

You forgot to mention &quot;Get insurance.&quot;

Weird,
Everett Barnes
