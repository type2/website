That my problem the is from 25 feb 1964 and the engine is from around July /
August 1967.

I can see that it's stamped 17 and I think it's the part number that ends
with 021

I can't get my head all that long into engine comparment

	&lt;&lt; IF there are a 12v -&gt; 6v converter installed on the bus it are
mounted on
	 the wire after the generator, could I then have 2 wires out of the
generator
	 (1 to the 6v batteri and 1 to (a new) 12v batterie) ??????? &gt;&gt;
	Hi Lars,
	Who knows you might even have a cold fusion devise in there.  Until
you dig 
	and poke into it you will never really know!  Check your generator
for 
	stamped markings in it's outer circumferance for wether it is 7 or
14 volt.  
	Then check if the regulator has any simular markings.  Since your
bus is a 67 
	it should have been a 12 volt system, but who knows what has been
done to it 
	over the last 33 years!
