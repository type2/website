Subject: 63 transaxle differences?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10002231705460.86678-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

I have lately become enamored of small nut transaxles, who knows if that
will last or ??

anyway, i may have a lead on a 63 for a spare, but cant recall the exact
differences in a 63 transaxle as compared to 62 and older...

i/e i know the drum and stub axle are different, i seem to recall a bit
longer on the axle and snout, but by how much?

wow, i have posted a lot today, i must be revved up by all my work
yesterday.

peas,

Steve
