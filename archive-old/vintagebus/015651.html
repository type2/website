Subject: type2_dot_com status update


Well, we're still having DNS problems.  We have reports of some ISPs
getting the new information, only to &quot;revert&quot; to the old a few hours later.  
Your posts will still be queued up on your local ISP's server until
the timeout period they've defined (I've seen anywhere from 1 to 7 days)
so you don't need to re-post unless you've recieved a bounce message.

***

This is an informational message being sent to all of the subscribers
to the vintagebus and type2 lists, and no reply is necessary.

If you're getting this message, but had previously unsubscribed to
the list, don't fret!  I'm using an archived copy of the list
membership, which you may still be on.  When I update the archive,
you won't get these informational message any more.  Sorry about that...

You can also check the status of the list at

Thank you for your patience.
