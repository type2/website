Digging into the past here but as I remember it

The original Type4 1700 and 1800s had the same crank
and rods and simply enlarged the jugs to move from 1700
to 1800 (I can't remember the stock cylinder diameters off hand).

The 2 litre gained its capacity by altering crank stroke and
rods.

Thus you can't 'simply' put the 2 litre barrels with 1700
and 1800 crank and rods - deck heights are all wrong etc
etc.   You have to change the crank and rods as well.

You used to be able to buy 'big bore' slip in kits specifically for
1700 and 1800 engines though (cyls had the right height
for the stroke).  At one stage I built a 1700 with 96mm NPR
P&amp;C's and spent time balancing and blueprinting the engine
and it was great to drive.  These 'big bore' slip in cylinders did have 
a word of mouth reputation for early wear and blow by (much as the
Type 1 slip ins.....)

You know, I think that with all 'hot' motors you exchange driveability for
horsepower.
I'm a big fan of a  small displacement increases and spending money
on a counterweighted crank, blueprinting and balancing.  Smooth,
reliable 'free' horsepower.

p.s.  As I remember it the 'Porsche' motor is a 1700 and is most easily
picked by the extra head stud.  Lotsa people call the 'VW' 1700
the 'Porsche' motor.  

......
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well it appears that as for the fit of the 2L P/C's in a T4 case - that's
a
&gt; go - no machining work required there.  BUT since this Porsche engine is
an
&gt; 1800 (very few 2L ones ended up in Porsche's)
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone elaborate on the situation concering putting larger jugs on a
&gt; 1.8L to make it a 2.0?  I thought the only difference was strictly a
&gt; displacement issue.
