Subject: BBB VII - January 18-19, 2003! Lake Havasu City, Arizona. 

Hey all,
Just a reminder to plan on attending &quot;Buses by the Bridge&quot; event in Lake
Havasu, AZ during the weekend of January 18-19 2003. New location with
parking/camping on the grass instead of the usual Arizona dirt camping. (Hooray
for once!!)

I talked to Ronnie, the promoter this evening and he is in great spirits. He
reminded me that there is &quot;only&quot; two and one half weeks to go prior to the
event. There are raffle prizes galore this year. Knowing that I am an aircooled
turncoat and will be attending in my '97 Eurovan Camper, he said that there
will be a special award for the category of VWs 1980 to current model year. We
need to see a line up of exact, matching EVCs and Tiico engine converted Syncro
Westies etc. Drag out your megadollar MV, Westy, Winnie or mobile HAM shack! We
gotta show those aircooled hanger-oners how to *really* camp! =)

Saw mention of someone on the ev_update list from SE Arizona so there is no
excuses not to attend. Pregnant wimmen to &quot;Octo&quot;-genarians welcome. I'd love to
see a new crew of Eurovan and Vanagon folks. 

It's been a while since I have been able to make it to a distance event so the
family is looking forward to it. Pack an extra Madero for me and expect a good
time. Pomona will be dead! The action is in Havasu-baby!
