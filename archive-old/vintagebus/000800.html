&lt;&lt; How many of you run hose clamps on the gas lines and where? &gt;&gt;

I do, EVERYWHERE!! For the $.05 - $.10 a piece these things cost I think it 
would be foolish not to have them on every joint in the gas line from the 
tank all the way to the carb(s).  You may only &quot;need&quot; them from the pump to 
the carb, but it couldn't cost even a buck to put them everywhere.  Very 
cheap insurance.  Also make sure the brass inlet tube into the carb(s) is 
seated well.
