Well, it was only in the barn for around 7 years but still kinda neet. I 
first have to say THANKS to Kaz for lending a hand getting the but out from 
its cocoon storage shed. It was a nasty, cold, rainy day and we all got 
soaking wet and dirty.

I had been talking to the guy for around a year, but since he was in the 
service and always having to go to different countries, we could never get 
together. We finally made plans for this past weekend to meet in the 
Pensacola FL area. He lives someplace in GA, so he too had to travel to get 
there. It was at his parents house that is being rented to some folks.

Anyways, the weather was nasty, but it was do it or leave it....and I WASNT 
going to leave it ! We had to take down the tin that was hiding the cars 
inside the barn. We also found a barracuda, a Plymouth Valiant and an MG or 
Triumph of some sort. We had to pull the Valiant out of the barn to get to 
the bus. Getting the Vlaiant out was a chore in itself since it to had been 
there for awhile. Tires were flat and kinda stuck to the ground.

After the Valiant was out, it was time to pull the bus out. Andy's car would 
not budge it, so I hooked up my Nissan truck. After some pulling and 
tugging, it did move, but the drivers front wheel was locked. Andy and Kaz 
took the wheel/drum off and yanked the brake guts out. Now it would roll 
good. We then got it out into the rain (it needed the bath anyways) and had 
to load it onto the trailer. It was STILL pouring down rain and COLD.

Leaving the house, we had to travel a couple of miles on some super duper 
sloppy slushy mucky roads. According to Kaz, they truck the stuff in and its 
that red, nasty GA crap I suppose. Makes a real mess where ever its from.

Back to the motel, Kaz and I took some time to visit and warm up a little. 
Sunday we planed on getting together and seeing some split busses in the 
area. Thanks to Kaz, I got the needed Deluxe rear bumper and apron. Thats 
about the only thing the bus was missing. All the jail bars are there and 
even the middle seat. I do need one little jail bar bracket in the back 
hatch. It conects the two bars in the middle of the window. The chrome 
church key was haning in its little spot and there was even the original 
tool kit, but the pouch the tools  go into has seen better days.

If you want to see what pictures I have so far, go to this site. I hope to 
have a couple I took from the barn area, but they are on regular film.
