 What would be the safest way to cut up a bus?
 I'm guessing start with the roof and work your way down?
 So should I cut the roof in sections? Where do I make the cuts? Does anyone 
 have a website showing the safest way to do this?
  &gt;&gt;

it depends on what's wrong with the bus, and what you want to salvage off it.
