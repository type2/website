All:

Six nights ago about this time I was having a beer at my campsite 
with Bob Thompson (I think that's his last name), a fellow bus driver 
from St. Lucie, FL.  I'd met him while strolling through the very 
large campground at Hanna Park, on the Atlantic Ocean near 
Jacksonville.

Bob and I had never met but I knew he was kin when I arrived at his 
westy and heard Jethro Tull coming from the stereo.  I asked if he 
was in town for the show and that's how we ended up swapping lies 
back at my campsite later on.  I got a near-perfect checker cloth 
front curtain for my 71 westy from him for next to nothing before the 
evening was out.

Bob and I were the only socializing VW nuts in this rather large 
campground on the eve of Busses by the Beach, although I'd seen 
a vintage Beetle parked next to an RV when I pulled in from 
Tallahassee after an uneventful drive over -- my bus's first real road 
trip since I bought it and rebuilt (3x) the engine.  

I left work early and was on the road by 3:30.  At first, daunted by 
the fact that *everyone* was blowing past me on I-10 and I was still 
going faster than I wanted to, I'd exited to US 90 and loafed along 
through small courthouse-squared towns like Monticello and 
Madison and Greenville - Ray Charles' childhood home.  It's a 
truism that the byways are more interesting than the highways, but 
after crossing the Suwannee River and approaching Live Oak and 
the halfway point, I was ready for a challenge and jumped back up 
on the Ah-teyun and rode it the remaining 90 miles, trying to keep 
it just under 60.  I averaged about 24mpg and had plenty of gas left 
when I arrived, despite completing the last 20 miles in stop-and-go 
traffic on the beach road from Jacksonville to the coast.

Hanna park is unusual in that it's administered by the city of 
Jacksonville -- I can't think of another city-run park with a 
campground of this scope.  I was in site 228.  It's a nice place, 
nice facilities if not particularly private campsites, and $18/night 
includes water and electric.  Not a steal, but worth the $, as I 
discovered the next night.

I'd chopped a box of firewood for the trip but Friday night was far 
too balmy.  After Bob left I read a few pages of Leni Riefenstahl's 
memoirs (she was riding splitties in East Africa in the early 60's) 
and hit the sack.  The new-to-me full width Campmobile 80 z-bed 
from the junkyard was so comfortable that I deliberately slept in 
until 11AM.  Busses are so much more soundproof than tents.

Saturday, a short drive down A1A brought me to the show.  I think I 
was one of the last ones in.  I paid my $5 and parked in a lot right 
next to the ocean with about 25 other busses ranging from the 50's 
up (I don't think there were any vanagons on Sat).  I'd brought a few 
items to sell but my main purpose was to just hang with the 
brothers.

I set up and took a quick tour - a few guys had some parts out but 
of course all the $25 NOS semaphores were gone by 12:30 for 
some reason, so I didn't find anything I couldn't live without.  Ran 
into Kevin Murray and we chatted about having another Love Bug 
campout at O'Leno State Park like we did a few years ago -- more 
on that if anything comes up.

Not long after I returned to my bus Marv Krupp and Charlie Ford 
came by.  What nice guys!  Marv will talk your ear off, which he 
proceeded to do, while Charlie wandered off before I got a chance 
to do much but say hello.

(BTW Marv, that book I told you about -- Still Life with 
Volkswagens -- was written by a guy named Geoff Nicholson.)

After Marv left I had a brief, weird episode in which an intoxicated 
street/beach person decided to hang with me for about a half hour 
while he explained to me why someone else at the show was 
asking too much for his bus.  One of the really different things 
about this show and the next day is the location, in an open-
access parking lot along the beach: you get all sorts of casual 
traffic, which is really cool for the most part -- the spectators 
seemed a little more excited and amused than usual.

I was looking for Dave Easterwood and finally found him in 
midafternoon.  Dave's a great guy - very mellow and pleasant, with 
a ready laugh.  Talked to Charlie Ford a little more and fawned over 
his legendary status, which he immediately put me at ease over.  I 
had such a completely different picture of the guy in my mind than 
the fellow I met.  For some reason I had this image of a more 
unkempt mountain-man kind of guy.  I dunno, maybe he's shaved 
and bathed since the trip.  :-)  I'm sure it's due to his friendly and 
disarming nature, but I felt like I made a buddy almost right off the 
bat.

I was still kinda feeling like an outsider and a tad lonely, having 
come over by myself, as the day wore towards a close.  At the 
awards and raffle thing, I won a poster and Kathy Jacobs of SEVW 
called my name.  Dave Raistrick heard it and came over afterwards 
to say hello, and I also met Andrew Leverentz, whose bus won 
Ugliest, as he's mentioned.  Both really nice, longhairs like myself. 
 Heepies.

After the show Mark Pribanic invited us all over for a keg at his 
house nearby.  Must've been over a dozen mostly splitties 
including Tony's immaculate pickup from Texas.  We hung out for a 
while and then Charlie, Dave R and Andrew and I decided to head 
back to the parking lot (where they planned to spend the night) and 
try a couple of Charlie's tandem kayak things in the surf.  That is, 
they decided to do that and I decided to tag along -- I'd been 
wanting to get in the water all day.

But by the time we got back over to the park, the wind, which had 
been blustery all day, began to pick up even more and we noticed 
a dark mass of clouds coming up.  We dawdled, checking out the 
teenage beach crowd.  Marv came out of the Irish pub across the 
street (Oh THERE you are, Marv!) and joined us.

Bout this time I decided I would pass on the beach.  It was starting 
to turn cooler as the sun went down and behind the cloud mass.  I 
really wanted to stay at the parking lot overnight with the gang, but 
between the rising wind, dropping temps, and boom-boom of teeny 
bopper stereos the campground was sounding nicer.

Charlie had left a folding chair back at Mark's kegger, so I 
volunteered to pick it up and bring it with me for the Sunday show.  
I got back to Mark's and even more people had arrived and they 
were getting ready to head out for pizza.  About that time a serious 
squall blew through and the temperature began to drop more 
quickly.  I got Dave Easterwood to return Charlie's chair and 
headed back to the campground.

The night before, I'd shared a row of 20 campsites with one family.  
Sometime Saturday, the Indian Princesses arrived and when I got 
back there were a dozen little girls with flashlights running around 
shrieking and calling each other pseudo-indian names until 11pm.  
The squall had gone through and as it got dark the sky began to 
clear.  They were predicting temps in the 30s overnight!

I ate in the bus, cozily, then built a fire (glad I'd saved that firewood) 
and tried to ignore the Indian Princesses, although I did go stand 
and glower at them in my best Dangerous Pedophiliac Hippie style 
when they held a noisy confab at the edge of my campsite, but to 
no avail.  Eventually things quieted down and I ran out of firewood.  
Time for bed.

(I had the strangest thing happen when I lit the propane lantern -- at 
first it wouldn't light, then the flame would finally catch the gas and -
-puff-- blow itself out.  Second time it did this I noticed small blue 
flames licking up the sleeve of my sweater along with a crackling 
noise and a bad smell.  The flames and crackling crawled right up 
my arm and began to head around my back and I'm thinking here 
goes the ponytail, doing the slap-your-back dance in the bus as 
the smoke begins to appear.  But the flames just crackled down 
my other sleeve and winked out.)

Hearing that the next day's show was expected to be large, I rolled 
out of the campsite early and got to the lot before 8 -- but due to 
the incredibly surprising overnight temperature shift, things got off 
to a slow start.  It was cold and windy, but clear.  Ran into Charlie 
and Dave R and Andrew and from what they said I was glad I went 
back to the campfire and hot shower the night before.

Sunday's &quot;VWs by the Seaside&quot; was a little smaller than last 
year's but there were still almost 100 show cars.  I entered my bus 
as Camper Modified and was the best and worst in class!  Finally 
got to meet David __ of the Bug Junction in Gainesville, had a nice 
conversation with a father/son combo out of central Ga who had 
brought their mid-70's westy, and had another nice day once the 
weather warmed up.

After the awards I met my sister &amp; her husband for dinner, then hit 
the road back to Tally.  Alas, the tranny popped out of 4th twice in 
the first 30 miles.  I held it most of the rest of the way and am 
looking out for a good replacement, but it's not a pressing need.  
Otherwise the bus performed far better than my wildest 
expectations.

Whew!  Sorry for such a long one, but this was a great trip.  
Southeast US camping-folk, let's do one together soon!
