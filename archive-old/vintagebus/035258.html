&lt;&lt; Any ideas on what it might be, and how much it would cost to fix?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Josh,
Unless your shift linkage is in real bad condition, then it is worn internal 
tranny parts!  If the latter is what is going on, figure anywhere from 
$500.00 to $1,000.00 for a reliable rebuild depending on how many used parts 
the rebuilder is competant at reusing.  This does not include removal and 
installation of the tranny.  Eric&amp;Barb
