&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;?  I am
not above trying to make, or hack as we say in the biz, my own &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Easy with the term hack, I been getting alot of hacks, In my biz I fabricate
stuff we need not hack, to me in all forms hacking is screwing up something
that should have been fixed rite the first time, and saved you time and
money probably in the long run.. just .02 worth .....
