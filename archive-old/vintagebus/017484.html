&gt; First go under the bus with goggles on.  There use a piece of 2x4&quot; to rap 
&gt; both sides of the cable tube the full length.  This hopefully will jar loose 
&gt; the rust locking it in place.  

this seems to me to be sound advice...

&gt;   If the above does not do the trick you are going to have to park the bus 
&gt; with it's nose uphill and/or with the front end up on jackstands.  Then pour 
&gt; some sort of acid (Phospheric, Muteric, Hydrochloric or other.) to remove the 
&gt; rust inside the tube over several days or even weeks untill the cable loosens 
&gt; up. 

but this scares the sh*t outta me!  wouldn't positioning the bus the same way and then spraying penetrating liquid do the same thing (almost) but be a whole lot less dangerous?
