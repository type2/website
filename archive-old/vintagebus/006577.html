    Yeah, you can go to sam's club or costco and buy an ez-up tent for about
$150.
The early westy tents and sundial (ez also) all require brackets on the bus.
The big top westy tent from the mid 60's and the bubble tents are not the
most practical for parking lots and short stays.I have attached the rail for
these tents without drilling my bus,i clamped the rail to the rain gutter
using aluminum screen door channels from the hardware store.
    I have seen US made tent that attach via straps over the roof to the
fender wells and rockers of the drivers side.One was called &quot;The Redhead&quot;
and worked great on a bus.A friend of mine has one of these and it works
great.
          good luck,

&gt; After hanging out in my friends tent over the Classic weekend and becoming
&gt; re-born in the amazing thing called shade, I would like to have some. Is
&gt; there any type of tent or more or less awning that does not require holes
or
&gt; brackets in the roof of my bus? I am willing to drill the small holes in
my
&gt; bumper. Just curious.
