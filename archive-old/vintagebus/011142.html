&lt;&lt; Arent ambulance fans *fairly* easy to find?  Why is it that they are 
commanding such high prices?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Frank,
Due to the demand for them is still way higher than the supply.  We have 
quite a few rare parts that we have only seen less than a hand full or less 
at meets over the last 15 years.  Being so rare, exotic, and unrecognisable 
that almost no one knows of them, and so the demand, and thusly the price for 
them when you can find these parts is way low.  Plus there are parts owners 
can point to which are easily recognised by mostr volks with a high coolness 
factor which as always increases thier price!  Kind of like large diamonds.  
Which are just big pieces of shiney carbon, but silly humans will kill each 
other over to get!   Eric&amp;Barb
