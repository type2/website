Subject: CB valve covers?

Happy friday everyone,
Now that I have remembered what day it is I have an appropriate
question. In the BBB raffle I won some CB Performance cast aluminum
finned bolt-on valve covers. I am not going to get rich by selling
them, so I think I might just put them on the bus. While I don't
expect higher speed or greater torque or bolt-on power, there is no
harm in using these things, is there? They won't over-cool my cylinder
heads or anything will they? (I do have functioning thermostat and
flaps)
Thanks,
Joel and the '64 Sundial
