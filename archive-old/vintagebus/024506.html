Subject: RE: Friday Stumper: Wet Paint (answer)

Well, I would hit you up for my e-dollar, but we didn't shake on it! :)
When I stripped the old, tired '65 Bus, the paint on the torsion bars
was not wet. (I assume what you're calling torsion arms is what I know
as torsion bars) Maybe your torsion tube was sealed better than mine and
the atmosphere was filled with paint solvent vapors. VW may have
intended for the paint to stay wet or flexible since this bar is
constantly twisting. 

What you're talking about does appear to be paint, about the color of
red primer only glossier. I checked torsion bars that I've got from my
'65 bus, '67 Bug, and '64 Bug, which all appeared dry when I pulled
them.

NOTE: I have at least one book that cautions against scratching,
nicking, or otherwise damaging this paint. There is enough tension in
the bars that they claim rust will cause or increase the likely hood of
torsion bar failure. I've know people that have broken torsion bars,
although I never have after 19 years of driving splitties hard, and I
suspect the failure was due to rust damage.

To err on the side of caution, the torsion bars in my stash are wrapped
in towels or ratty VW Bug carpeting. I also keep them together as a set,
so I don't mix &amp; match (don't know if it matters, but I bet Clara wishes
someone had taken care to match parts on her trans!).

Hope this is worth 2 cents to some of you,

&gt; It'll take you a little while (like a day) to confirm or refute my suspisions. The paint is on the torsion arms right behind that torsion arm cover. I discovered this when I parted out a '65 bus; I took everything useable from the bus and was very surprised when I pulled off the covers and discovered the brown/red paint on the torsion arms was still wet, sealed inside the rear end, totally isolated from fresh air. Smelled like paint; felt like paint. Tacky, easily rubbed off onto something else, including your hands. I'm sure it's paint.
