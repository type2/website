Subject: Solex Carb 32/34 PDCIT-2  and -3?
Message-Id: &lt;9907120651223A.05531_at_weba2.iname_dot_net&gt;

Hi all,
my name is Ian and am currently living in Sweden (still). I used to belong to this list a while back and as I now have my vw back with me, and its the summer, I thought I'd rejoin again.

I own a '78 Westy which body wise is in good shape, just the pop top needing some attention. The rubber seel and the canvas both in need of replacement.

The engine has had its fair share of trouble though. Which I won't go into now as I would end up writing a book! I have had the heads rebuilt by a professional (hopefully) and the engine is all back in place again now. I just need to get her going!

The timing seems correct and it is just the carbs that I would like some help with.

I recently sifted through the archive and the library and noted a few items on Solex carbs

However my carbs are marked differently. One is a Solex 32/34 PDCIT-2 and the other a 32/34 PDCIT-3. I bought a couple of second hand ones and with my two originals managed to rebuild two new carbs.

Now that I am placing them back in the engine I am looking for details on how to set them up. Can I use the two articles above? Are there any tools you recommend getting?

Any help greatly appreciated,
Ian
