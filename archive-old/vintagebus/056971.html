&gt; Actually, no.  I was able to tour the Purolator plant in SLC while I still

&gt; special lights.  No heat, just light made it cure.  He let us put our hand

&gt; out the tunnel too.  It was very neat.

That would be UV (ultraviolet) light beyond the high frequency end of the
visible spectrum.  It it probably wouldn't hurt you for a short exposure,
but longer would give you a nice tan.  Not good for your eyes either.
