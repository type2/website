I guess Lake Havasu must be home of budget Wally worlds, I walked in (after
Rex Rogers told me what to look for) asked the toy clerk and 5 minutes later
she came out with the elusive? bus and trailer/bug combo. Took it to the
register along with the matchbox buses I grabbed also and was charged $9.97
seems like Wallys standerd price, seen them go on e-barf for 25.00, guess
some people just have to have it or are to lazy to check wally worlds.

Whats even more interesting is in the first reports I saw on the newsgroup
about them, they were $9.99; in fact they were being ebay'd already _at_ that
price.
