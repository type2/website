Subject: Re:  [VB] tranny leaking gear oil
To: jelm2_at_yahoo_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

is it leaking from the side of the center section?  can you tell if it is the 
center circle or the outer circle of nuts?   There are specific torque values 
for those nuts- you could try checking the torque, but overtorquing can bend 
the plates and this wouldn't help the leak.

You could try carrying around a oil drain bucket and sliding it under the 
parked bus.

It probably is the sort of thing you would have to take apart a bunch of 
stuff to fix. 

 I had a tranny like this and I would top up the gear oil frequently.

Hey.
Good news is, the huge oil slick which forms under
DARTHVW when parked overnight is not engine oil.
The bad news is, it's tranny gear oil. The drops are
coming from the bottom-most nut on the passenger's
side  sideplate.

It leaks about 4 tablespoons in a 24-hour period from
gravity alone. It looks like the mounts on the frame
block a lot of the nuts there for me to get in and
wrench 'em down, but I took a brief look.
