Subject: Re: [VB] Oil temperature measurement point

FWIW, an alternate view on a good measurement point was provided by Bob
Hoover in a message from 19 October 1995 that I found a couple years ago
through a Type2 archive search:

&quot;Just to the right of the oil pump on the rear of every Type 1 engine
you'll see a slotted plug.  It is about a half an inch in diameter and
the slot is moon-shaped, rather like the cut-out for a Woodruff key,
unsuited for removal with a regular screwdriver.&quot;

&quot;The plug closes off the drilled passage that supplies oil from the sump
to the oil pump inlet.  Inside the crankcase the oil pick-up tube is a
press fit into the drilled passageway, the pick-up prevented from
turning by being secured to one of the oil sump plate studs.&quot;

&quot;The inlet to the oil pump is one of the best places to measure your
oil's temperature, since the oil has been drawn from the deepest part of
the sump and gives an accurate indication of the average oil temp which
can vary by more than a hundred degrees F depending on where the
temperature is measured.&quot;

&quot;J.C. Whitney provides an adapter that matches the threads of the
slotted plug...the adapter is internally threaded to accept the standard
oil temperature sender...that matches their electric oil temperature
gauge...&quot;

The message has further details and sounds very reasonable.  I'm
thinking of trying it myself someday when I instrumentize my DC.

&gt; Seems as though the best location for the sender is in the main oil
&gt; gallery or in the right rear quadrant of the sump where a dipstick sender
&gt; would live.  The sump plate does not seem to be such a good place for a
&gt; sender.
