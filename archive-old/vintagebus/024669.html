Subject: Part ??'s 

Hi all,

What model, part number, type radio do I need for my '59 deluxe?
Is there a part number on the front ashtray?  If so what should I have?
Is there a part number on the rear ashtray?  If so what should I have?
Is there a part number on the Oh Sh*t bar on the dash?  If so what
should I have?

While I'm still a little confused on this Eurospec stuff, it has
Semaphores, which is supposed to mean that it is a Euro spec.  I don't
know what that means as far as part differences and what not.  Should I
be hunting out Euro parts?  Engine Deck with tail light, different tail
lights etc.?

While I know many hate HVW, they do occasionally do some nice photo work
and in the most recent copy, there is a very well done '58.  This bus
started the whole question of when Semaphores thread.  With the
exception of the color should I be modeling my parts search after this
bus?

As always, thankful for everyones wisdom, and while I didn't know him
the outpouring of support for him shows a lot of compassion and caring
for him.  Piece be with you Josh.

Aaron
