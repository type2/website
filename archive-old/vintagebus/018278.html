I took a heater box and connector hose to my local mufffler shop and they
made some adapters for me.

Hello all!

I'm *this* close to having my exhaust system back together... :)

While comparing my new and old heater boxes today I noticed that the
new ones have larger warm air outlets on the front.  The metal tubes
I have to connect the heater boxes to the body won't fit over these
new, larger outlets.  (They fit the tubes on the body just fine,
though).  Bentley's mentions the change and an adapter ring, and
RMMW sells &quot;60mm to 50mm&quot; heater box-body hoses.  Will these hoses
do the job, or is there some other slick way to adapt the bigger
heater boxes to the smaller hoses?  Is the adapter that the Bentley's
mentions still available anywhere?

I also adjusted the valves today...the PO must have kept up on this
pretty well, as there was only one (#2 exhaust) that was a little
tight...the rest were fine.  New plugs too.  I am starting to get
&quot;bus fever&quot;...it has been sitting too long and I want to drive it!!
:)

Thanks!
