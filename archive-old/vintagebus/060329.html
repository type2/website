Jay,

So you don't understand wiring diagrams and you don't understand mechanical
books. Sounds like you are going to have a major problem doing mechanical
repairs on your bus by yourself.

Are there any good VW repair shops in your area?

&gt; hahaahahahah...yeah...i definitely understand wiring diagrams. no, i
&gt; understand some of them, a little bit, but it would be easier to see a
&gt; real life picture instead of a perfectly segmented color coordinated
&gt; (which isnt how mine is AT ALL) totally fictional diagram of something
&gt; that does'nt relate to my wiring at all. they should draw the wiring
&gt; diagram all tangled up and un matched colors with electrical tape
&gt; holding connections together and wires tied to the deck lid.
