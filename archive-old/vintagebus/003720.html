Subject: Bus electrical problem

My Bus ('55 Kombi) broke down again tonight, same symptoms as what I thought
I had fixed 2 weeks ago.  Electrical problem, it appears.  Everything is
stock.

Here's a description, any help/suggestions would be much appreciated:
Fuel and spark are good.  For some reason, I am getting only 2 volts
measured at terminal 15 (terminal from the ignition switch).  I suspect this
is a problem.  When I turn the engine by hand so the points open, I get 6
volts at both coil terminals.  There is also 6 volts coming from the
ignition switch, measured when I disconnected the wire from the coil.  I
also get 6 volts at terminal 15 if I disconnect terminal 1, the wire to the
condenser.  This makes me think the condenser is grounding the coil.
Normal?

Condenser, cap, rotor, points all have around 200 miles on them.  Battery is
about 3 months old.  I tried another good used coil, same symptoms.

As a side note, I have been driving the Bus to and from work in the dark for
2 weeks, 45 minutes each way, could a low battery cause these problems?
After it sat for a while, it started right up but then died soon after.
Headlights are bright and it cranks normally...

I also noticed that the generator/regulator are only putting out 6.5 volts
at about 2500 rpms.  Shouldn't it be 7 or so?

Thank you,
Everett Barnes
