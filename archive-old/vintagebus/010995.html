&lt;&lt; Now I'm trying to get the dowel pins back out. I wiggled them with vise 
grips, but I'm not having much luck. Anyone got any clever suggestions?  I 
have a drill and easy-outs to get the old halves out... &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
That might work if you are very carefull not to break off the easy-out.  If 
you have a welder you probably can just weld tabs on the broken pieces and 
remove.  Just make sure to attach the welder ground strap to the rear pulley. 
 Make sure the holes are not ovaled in the crank due to the FW coming loose.  
If they are then you really need to take it to a shop and have new holes 
drilled in the crank.  If the FW holes are ovaled junk it.    Eric&amp;Barb
