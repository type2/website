Well, I just got back from Jerome.  Long drive to Albuquerque, but we made 
it.  I had the usual sort of experience someone has every year.  On my way to 
the gas station to leave town, I stopped by my shop, and Barry pointed out 
that I was pouring oil out of the engine onto the street.  Two hours, and two 
oil cooler seals later and, with help from John Furst, we were on our way!

Good show, great wedding (Dawn and Richard), nice reception at the pizza 
place/microbrewery in town (flush toilets!), and lots of old and new friends! 
 Rachel from California, the VTO folks, Rich Yost, &quot;danglin' &quot; Jim Ellis, 
(with Paula and Audrey), Ronnie and  John &quot;VW&quot; Howard, Joe Clark from 
Florida, Theo, Philip and Catherine, Don Haight, and many others.

Don, thanks for the popcorn - Ronnie and John did an incredible taco thing, 
and then brisket and chile rellenos (I brought the chile from New Mexico - 
hope it wasn't too hot for anybody!)

Altogether a good Jerome, and I understand the winner of the raffle bus 
camped in my back yard on the way to the show!

If you haven't made it to Jerome yet, plan on next year!!!
