OK. Maybe only one. I started tearing it apart tonight. Got it up on 
jackstands, all wheels removed. Then realized I should've broken the rear 
drums loose first! Oh, well, I'll get to them later. Worked on teh front. Got 
it tore down to the bare spindles(which wasn't too difficult being as 
everything except teh drum was gone!). Then I began chiseling away 33 years 
of crud. My question stems there. What kind of front end is this and what is 
the usual resto process for this? I have done nothing but type 1's and 
hummers the last 4 years, and this looks like a combination of ball joint, 
link pin, and jeep front end. What exactly am I looking at under there under 
all that dirt grime etc...I want to do this right, but I'm not rich either. 
If I can fix/rebuild it, that is what i will do. I don't want to replace 
everything with new  parts! TIA!

hm, I never but never have wheels off the ground unless I need them off.   I 
recommend putting the back ones back on while you work on the front.   have 
all 4 on the ground when you break the nts loose, and remove one rear at a 
time to do brakes, it is easier to pull the drum off with the rim attached I 
feel.   Safety.  wheels are sturdier than jackstands.

You should have a kingpin suspension.  Read your idiot book by muir. it has 
pictures and expanations.   if you dont have one get it.  the bentley is nice 
too.  read the idiot book section- it shows what  everything is.  what do you 
need to fix?  well, if it aint broke dont fix it.  un the wiggle and look 
test to see what is worn (a friend to wigggle the  steering  wheel is 
helpful)     Grease everything till new clean grease comes out, and dont 
forget 4 fittings each spindle.

how much play is there in the steering wheel?   a few inches is ok, a loose 
spot a third of hthe wheel turn is scary.  where is the play at.
