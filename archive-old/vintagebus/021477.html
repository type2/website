I dunno about mesh platinum, but Lenny does incredible work...
The grey vinyl on my '59 panel bench seat is so thick, durable, and feels 
really nice... His stiching is awesome!!!!
Lenny is the man!

who is Lenny and how canhe be contacted?  I know someone who wants seat 
covers for his 65 walkthrough with thrashed seats-   any idea of price?
