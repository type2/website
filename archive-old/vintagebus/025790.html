&gt; Anyone ever seen this special oil screen sump he has?  I presume this would

&gt; Someone want to send this along to Hoover for comment? I think this is a
&gt; great set of photos and discussion point.  Not to tear the guy down
&gt; unnecessarily, I appreciate he took the time to share what he knows...

I havent seen the pics of the plate...where are they?

My guess is that it is a windage tray, if it is an airplane.
The formula vee guy who my old shop built engines for used one... it
keeps the oil level during sustained cornering... they were standard in
type4 engines, but never factory in a type1.
