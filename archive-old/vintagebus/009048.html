Hey you guys - you gotta check this out.  I know that Jerry just sold
Drakula to some place in Indiana but here is a Westfalia funeral trailer.
Go to a translator site and copy and paste in the URL.  The price isn't too
bad and the condition of the trailer doesn't appear too bad either.  I just
wonder if they towed this with a bug or if it was for those special
occasions where having 2 funerals for the price of one was warranted.  Very
interesting stuff.
