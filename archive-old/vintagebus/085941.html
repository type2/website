Subject: Re: [VB] Questions about the metal fuel line to fuel pump in

&gt; 	I know that the place where the metal fuel line passes through
&gt; the front tin is an historic problem area, but I believe that there are
&gt; adequate fixes for this (Bob Hoover had one involving lamp parts and, I
&gt; think I recall that veewee111 recommends wrapping the fuel line w/
&gt; bicycle inner tube).

Actually, that one is mine.  A 1 1/2 inch strip of inner tube wrapped
around the line until it is just a bit larger than the hole in the tin.
Makes a nice friction fit and if it starts to fail it will take a long
time to split the entire strip.  The original ones I did with a strip of
truck inner tube are still doing well over a decade late.

I've never seen a pre-bent tube.  The tube comes from the hole in the
front tin, passes between the manifold and cylinder tin, and then curves
around to get a straight shot at the fuel pump.  When I replaced mine I
just got a length of steel brake line (from a Chevy pickup, IIRC) and bent
and tweaked it until it was the right shape.
