Well, it turned out that the oval/rag/semaphore bug I went to get was a real hack and I didn't buy it after all.  6 hour round trip drive for nothing.  So, on the way home, I stopped back by this bus and looked it over again and started getting really good vibes.  So, called and talked w/the other some more today.  He was firm w/his $2k price but threw in some extras: 1 set of front doors, 1 bug engine (1600 &quot;that ran when we pulled it out&quot;) and 1 extra &quot;middle seat&quot; (I haven't seen it. Don't know if it is middle or rear or what year it is out of).  He also made the trip up to the previous owner's and got the rear pressed bumper and the rest of the trim.  

So, I bought it.  It is going to be a lot of work.  I drove back up tonight and took pics.  You can see them at http://community.webshots_dot_com/user/vws if you have a strong stomach.  Feel free to laugh...my wife thinks I'm nuts.  My goal is to get it back on the road in 1 year.  I don't do body work but have had it looked at by the guys I'll use for this project.  They'll start on it in October or November, so I have a few months to start collecting parts.

I get it delivered on Monday.  When I get home from work, I'll lay out all the trim, interior parts, &amp; glass and take a few more pics.  I'm not very familiar with deluxe models, so I'll be depending on the list to tell me what I'm missing.

Two more things I found today that the bus has still on it: Fuse block cover &amp; 2 coat hooks.  We'll see what is in all the boxes of stuff that came out of the bus come Monday when I really have time to go through it all.

Stay tuned....

-Tom
