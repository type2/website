Subject: Bus is hot need help

Well after a few months of trying to get a progressive carb working in my 
bus.  I tore it out Friday night and couldn't get the stock one in till 
today, causing me to miss busengruvin.  Traded my vacuum dizzy to Richard 
Barker for a 009 and now I am unsure of what the timing should be.  Muir 
says for and AE case it should be at 5deg ATDC, but that's with a vacuum 
dizzy.  I have it at about 11 degrees ATDC, it's running well and idles fine 
around 900 bud it is damn hot.  All my tin is in place and the progressive 
ran pretty cool, but too rich no matter what.   So what gives? 34 pict 3 on 
an AE case w/ 009.

BTW:  Progressive carb for sale/trade w/ manifold and linkage kit

Even though its running hot, its like a new bus.  I didn't realize how bad 
that progressive was.

I will be at Cinci tomorrow, will be taking pics.  Looking forward to some 
of the workshops.
