I doubt Joe F. will sell me his roof clip off of his 21(23?) Window.  I
recently was the proud purchaser of the 15 Window Deluxe that Erin Lassley
posted about several weeks ago in the Midwest.  I still don't have it yet,
can't seem to find reasonable trucking, but working on it.

After reading Joe's post, I started thinking it would be cool to convert the
bus into a 23 Window.  Common thought I'm sure.  I figured I'd just graft on a
whole new roof section, but then I started thinking it would probably be
easier to cut out both of the 4 skylight sections on each side and graft those
in.  Seems a lot simpler.

Any ideas or experiences with this?  Anyone have a roof section or skylight
sections laying around creating a tripping hazard?

putting a new roof/sunroof roof section onto a bus is, of course, a lot of
work.  All must be carefully measured.    Probably cut it so that the top of
the window frames stays with the old roof, which means careful fitting so the
windows go inproperly.       With the new roof section on, the belly pans must
be added.   All the sunroof buses , and also the double door panels came with
these for added structural support, and any newly made sunroof bus should have
them too.   Das Bullie Haus sells the subfloor pans (at least the outer ones-
I woud check about the midde one).   I haven't seen them,  but hear that they
are perfectly servicable, even if not identical to the original.

The idea of cutting the skylights out is interesting.     I woud take a good
look at a sunroof roof before doing that.    VW made sunroof buses w/o
skylights (standards and panels) and they have the inner skin and
reinforcements around the skylight holes, though no outer skylight holes.
I don't believe they made them w/skylights and w/o sunroofs, though.   You
would want to make sure the reinforcements across the roof side to side stay
intact.    The reason for the small poptop, AFAICS, is that it is cut where
there are no reinforcements, and thus takes away less integrity than cutting a
huge hole in the roof w/o adding reinforcements.  It is just a covered hole to
stand up in.     I think the splitty sunroof is one of the largest, if not the
largest, sunroof, next to a convertable.
