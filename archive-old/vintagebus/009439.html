I was having trouble deciphering black and white printed copies of the wiring diagram for my '66 Bus.  I decided to load wiring diagram image on a diskette and go to Kinko's and see what they could do for me.  Kinko's had a 11x17 inch paper which is not too big to hold and not so small that you cannot read it and in beautiful color also.  I also had the printout laminated so I could keep the diagram nice for a long time and not look like a grease smear in two weeks :)  The total damage was only $5.49!  If I knew it was that cheap and easy I would have done it a long time ago.

Wonderful accurate colored wiring diagrams can be found at     http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring  This is very helpful for those of us who have mouse nests for wiring...  Why the PO cut 10 wires off and left the rest alone is beyond me? Why? Why? Why?

Also when re-wiring be sure to polish the connectors to ensure a solid connection.  I use a Dremel tool with the small wire brush and it reaches in and polishes the copper connectors nicely.

Happy Holidays,
