&gt; So where do you get a 356 pulley?

I found what looks like the correct pulley from penguin parts, but
until I receive it I will not know the size. The parts didn't state
the size. I will most likely give it a try since I'll be driving
across the western US loaded down and on the old highways. After all
if I carry an extra belt it sure is no problem to swap the gen pulley.
