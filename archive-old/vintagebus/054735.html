Very common. I was standing in NAPA talking to the employee. While he was 
telling me they don't have it and never did, I found it on the shelf and 
said, &quot;Oh, here it is&quot;. He didn't even act embarressed. Didn't even make 
any excuses or anything. Asked me if I wanted anything else. I should have 
told him I do, but I'll probably have to find it myself.

BTW this has happend more than once at my local NAPA. I don't like the 
place. But they always seem to have a part I need when no one else will. 
Unfortunatly you pay out the arse for it.
