Cruising the net with no apparent purpose,
and found Sportsmobile camper conversions.
http://www.sportsmobile_dot_com/

On their main page they indicate that
their first conversion was in 1961 and it
shows a picture of a, you guessed it, a VW.
Unfortunately they no longer convert VW's.

So for you history of conversions people,
drop a line to these folks and maybe they
have some dusty stuff hanging around!
