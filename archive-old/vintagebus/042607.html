hello all,

Well i must say that my brake light upgrade is a success as far as i am
concerned.

I drove to kansas city and back.  I plyed with the taillights in the
campground a bit and they lit up the night behiond the bus when i hit the
brakelight, very visable.

And i will say that when i hit the brakes on the highway or put on my turn
signals people really seemed to notice a lot more.

I went to KC to visit some friends and Dan Kinsey traded me 2 of the 3
interior panels i need for my bus for the service of delivering some parts
to a guy here in stl. (thanks dan...) And 2 more that mine ar OK but these
are much nicer (no holes kicked in em, hehe)

We camped out near KC saturday night with our friends, and that was a lot
of fun, people watching the 4th of july weekend was a blast in this
campground! (longview lake if you know KC..)

Sunday we went and wandered around Lawrence, ate some chineese food, and
stopped by Rick Taylors to say howdy, but he wasnt home :(

Having a bunch of crap on my roof rack and my front end out of alignment
really hurt my gas mileage, but thats the way it goes. I plan to align
tonight, and deliver the rack load as well...

We tucked in behind a kind of beat up semi for 100 miles withotut
stopping, to save on gas as he was a big windbreak and made my roof rack 
aerodynamics not affect mileage so much. he was going a comfy 60 or so,
but he slowed down to 50 on a long uphill, so we passed. He honked and
waved, i think he was happy to have the company as everyone else was
passing both of us all night :)

I bought a backpacking pad at wally world to put on the front seat to pad
my butt, got a nice tan and brown mexican blanket, and 4 mini-bungee
cords.  I cut the pad to fit the bottom of the seat, and bungeed the
mexican blanket onto the back rest draped it over the butt pad. My whole
&quot;reupholstery&quot; job ran me about $14.00, and is comfy now. (my duct tape
reupholstery job wasnt holding up. It has separated from the vinyl and my
back was sticking to the seat, hehe.)

Figured out where to put my left foot so that my knee doesnt hurt...

all in all a really fun trip. 

I drove my friends bus that he just installed a rebuild transmission into,
wow what a difference shifting is snick snick, very tight. Made me decide
to fix up my tranny linkages and maybe fix my tranny (popping out of 2nd
is annoying)

My GF and i are going to tour the southwest this fall for a couple of
weeks, gotta start getting the bus ready :)

Take care,

Steve
