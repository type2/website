&gt;Are all engine bays painted black?

Commercial vehicles are primer in the engine bay, I believe, up to a certain
year.  My ex-'63 SC was white, my ex-'60 SC was factory-looking primer.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, my '55 was a pleasing Gold tone.  Original
owners probably thought it reflected heat better or something.

Gas tanks are grey.  Barndoor tanks are black, mine has &gt;5 coats of paint on
it.  Gas likes to be cozy in a paint blanket. (Sounds like a Claraism)
