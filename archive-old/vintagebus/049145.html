Dilectric grease... it's main purpose is to keep the electrons happy by keeping air, water, battery acid and Ronnie's spit from oxidizing the contact surfaces. 

There's a camper on E-bay with the looong driver's side window and only the door louvers on the passenger side. Must be a walk-thru, cause there's no upper rear vents.

Weird place for an antenna, must a been the guy who mounted 4' mirror stalks at the bottom of a local SC's doors. 

NQ; Breather tube from the oil fill. AFAIK you'll need a breather box, a open cell foam filled box vented at the top to collect blow-by and oil mist. Idea is that the pressures equalize in the box and the bottom hose drains the extra oil back to the engine through the oil filler vent. There's kits to vent the valve covers and the fuel pump block off plate. CB has a bunch of 'em.
