Shawn,

If you don't mind adding oil at regular intervals such as every time
you fill up with fuel, just drive it till it drops. I drove from New
York with a cracked case that did just what you described. The clutch
was slipping badly by the time I got to the rockies. Could only make
55mph on the up hills. By the time I got to S.F. I could only do about
25 on the hills. Made it home though.
Hope your case is not cracked as mine was. Maybe its just the front
seal.
Chris

&gt; Hello all. Well I took my bus on a little road trip today and things
&gt; happen. I made my first stop for gas and noticed that I was leaking
oil
&gt; pretty bad. The  oil  is coming from in front of the oil drain at
one of
&gt; the case connection bolts. When the engine is running it will drip
once
&gt; every 10-15 seconds, but when i turn off the motor it really starts
&gt; dripping. What the heck is going on? I tightened all the nuts and
bolts
&gt; in the area but it didn't stop the leak I changed the oil and
adjusted
&gt; the valves this morning before leaving and everything seemed fine.
What
&gt; course of action do I need to take from here? I stoped every so
often
&gt; and added oil and checked it and made the trip there and back but
now
&gt; I'm a little nervous Any and all help would be GREATLY appreciated.
&gt; Thanks.
&gt;
&gt; Shawn
