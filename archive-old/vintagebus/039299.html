Subject: Look VW ads
Date: Fri, 4 Sep 1998 05:56:20 -0700 

I have a list someone prepared that shows the Issues of 
Life magazine which contained advertisements for VW's.

Doe anyone have a similar list of ads in Look magazine?

If I had remembered to check before I left this morning,
I can provide two issues.  I dropped into a thrift center
and they had a pile of Look mags from the '65, '67 and '71.

I found a really cool ad from April '67 that showed a bug, 
squareback, and a deluxe bus.  The big text is:
Small.Medium.Large.  The view is from above and forward.

Very cool ad, since the color of the Sqbk matches the color
of my '67 Sqbk.  I also have a '67 Deluxe Hardtop, so I guess
I need a '67 bug to round out the set. Sucha deal at 50 cents each.

Eventually I'll get the ads to Thom for scanning.

The ad from '65 invites people to test drive a bug, door open
view from the rear.  I saw another issue with a text only ad.
The ones from '71 had no VW ads.
