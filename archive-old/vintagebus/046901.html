,bottom first, centered in the hole,, then have someone press the glass in 
gently, as i pull the wire around,,, flipping the seal into place
 
&gt;&gt; i pull the rubber into ,, the body,, not the rubber lip over the glass&lt;&lt;
 
 what your saying is to glue the rubber into the body with tar for sealing,, 
then work the glass into the rubber in the window opening?  &gt;&gt;

Hi Jamie,
Whoops!  Sorry for the misunderstanding!
We tried silicon sealant among alot of other types of sealant.  All but two 
of these failed within six months!  Due to the flexing of the VW body silicon 
sealant is not good unless it is a heavy bolt together area like RGBs.  
  You need to install the rubber around the window first, just after applying 
a bead of tar in the groove in the seal that the glass seats in.  Then wrap a 
automotive wire or smooth weed eater line (Some weed eater line now comes in 
sharp starlike cross sections that cuts wonderfully!) with the ends loosely 
knotted at bottom center.  Paint tar on the body frame and for doubly sure 
paint some on the outer part of the seal where it seats against the body.  
Then have a helper put the window up to the opening and make sure the 
wire/weed eater line ends are inside.  Carefully with spread hands and splade 
fingers push the window and seal into the opening till the seal comes up to 
the lip it has to flop over.  Then you get inside the VW while your helper 
keeps pressure against the window/seal and you pull one on one end of the 
line and the other while keeping both ends in hand/s at all times.  Work the 
seal evenly outward, up and to center top.  If the seal does not completely 
flop over used a dull slot tip screw driver to carefully flop the last of the 
seal over.  Clean excess tar off with tar remover from your FLAPS or use 
kerosene.
  If you still are not sure of this proceedure do check it out in the VW bus 
shop manual.
