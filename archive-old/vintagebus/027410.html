Hi Les,

I'm not Eric, and I don't play Eric on TV, but I've got a couple of CW
cranks that I bought from Southern Cal. Imports. They told me they were
Demello cranks, but I didn't see any markings on the boxes to confirm
that. Whoever made them did OK. I have 40k on my bus engine and 70k on
the truck with no problems. I'll never build another VW engine without a
CW crank.

&gt; 
&gt; Since you are recommending the counterweighted crank (and I had always
&gt; concidered one), can you enlighten us with a manufacturer of these that
&gt; is reliable??
