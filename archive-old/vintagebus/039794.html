My friend recieved a steering column in a trade- but this one looks odd, the 
column part bolts to the gear housing. There are some other obvious 
differences between it and others that I have looked at. The housing is 
stamped ATE on the side which I recognize. Is this a brazilian repro unit? 
Is it worth anything other than as a small club or boat anchor?
