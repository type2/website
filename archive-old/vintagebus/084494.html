Okay, I never thought list traffic would be to the point I'd have to
reply to myself in order to point out errors in my own posts :)

On further review, putting the relay coil in series with the oil
pressure light would set up the condition where the bulb filament has
to be intact for the pump to shut off automatically.  Also, the 12V
bulb is rated at 2W, making the current through the filament ~170 mA,
which might be on the low end to pick the relay coil.

I think the proper way to do this is to put the relay coil and idiot
light in parallel; you would run a short jumper from the wire on
terminal 30 over to terminal 86, leaving the blue and green wire on
the oil pressure sender, and the wire from relay terminal 85 would
also go to the pressure sender.  This way the relay coil still gets
power if the bulb is burned out and the pump shuts off like it's
supposed to.

Clear as mud?  Then my work is done here.
