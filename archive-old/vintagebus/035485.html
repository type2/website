&lt;&lt; I am not getting any power to the running lights (i think its connecter 
57) can this be fixed or am i going to have to look for a new one. &gt;&gt;
Hi Scott,
If you are getting power to the other lights then you need to take apart the 
switch as in our post a couple of weeks ago about soldering all the riveted 
connection inside (and outside for post-1960 VW lighting switches.).  Also 
check the prong connectors inside the switch for proper contact to the 
switching slider block.  If not contacting the prong for #57 probably also 
needs a bit of bending till it contacts the slider block firmly.
