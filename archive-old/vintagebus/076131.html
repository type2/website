Subject: My Shop is Hot!

All this time I havn't had electricity on in my new garage/shop. 
Reason why was because I didn't want to do it &quot;temporary&quot; and then 
have to re-do the work again. In order for that to happen I had to 
get a few interior finishing projects kinda done first. Money and 
time played a big part in that. Long story really...and boring too. 
But let's just say that the wait wasn't voluntary.

Anyway, the hardest parts of running the electricity had already been 
done. I ran my wire from the house to the garage. I dug a trench 2 
ft. deep from the house to the shop and buried conduit (75-100 ft I 
guess...all with a pick ax and shovel). I've basically been trying to 
do it all the work correctly the way I'd eventually want it to be 
instead of taking shortcuts just to get it done. It's been very hard 
and sometimes I wondered if maybe I should just rig it up so I could 
use the building.

The wife and kids went out of town for a few days so I finally got 
away from leveling the main house and got the work I needed done on 
the interior of the garage/shop to get me ready to turn on the 
electricity. This afternoon after work I hooked up to the house and 
flipped my breakers.

Now I've got electrical outlets and one of my lights going out there. 
Cool! The rest of the stuff is definitely all gonna be down hill from 
here.

The next thing to do will be to finish running the wires for my 
compressor. I've got a separate 10 X 20 out building that was built 
when the house was new (1950's). I'm using it as a parts house and 
separate work bench area. I'm gonna put the compressor in there so I 
don't have to listen to it. I had already dug a trench to it and 
buried the conduit/cable as well as my air lines. So I basically just 
have to pick my spot to put the compressor in the out building and 
run the wires to an outlet.

I will be out at the ranch tomorrow and will bring my compressor into 
town. Havn't been able to use it for over a year!!!!! I should have 
it hooked up this weekend or early next week. It's very cool to 
finally have this  shop project start to come together in a nice way. 
I'll have air tools again which will make changing the transaxle on 
the double cab something that I actually won't mind doing.

Things are looking better and better! Maybe I need to send the family 
away more often. Seems like I get a lot more work done for myself 
when they're away. Last time they left I got that double cab back on 
the road!
