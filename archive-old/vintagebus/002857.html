 I just want to give congrats to the newest 1950 panel bus owner ( vin 7869,
I think). It only took 10 years, but you got it. How did all you So Cal guys
miss this one ( kind of a rub in) ? Pays  to keep going back. Hope Ronnie
won&quot;t spill the beans and name the new owner, as he wants to DRIVE it to
Kelly Park this year.
 See you all at the Red Barn Sat.

 John ( not the new owner, but wish I was ) Howard, and hope Ronnie keeps
his you know what shut!
