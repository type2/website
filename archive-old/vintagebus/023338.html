Stephen,

I saw Dawn at OCTO, camped with her Saturday night, caravaned with her to the 
Classic, and consider her a good friend.  I know things have been tough for 
her, and as soon as I saw her, I asked if she was caught up yet.  She told me 
that things were going well and indicated that she had a check &quot;in her 
pocket&quot; for you.

I think this is the exception to the rule &quot;the squeaky wheel gets the grease&quot;.

JP
