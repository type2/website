&lt;&lt;Like I have
been using carb clean in a can to clean out the engine case for a motor
I am
building (very low miles, but it caught on fire and stuff fell into the
motor- its a newer case with the plastic cam plug-  when dd they start
using
those?)&gt;&gt;

Clara,

I know you probably know more about engine building than I can ever hope
for, but your post caught my eye because you say that you are building a
new engine from one that had caught fire. If I remember, I think Bob
Hoover had a post outlining why this isn't a good choice. That the
excess heat stresses the case and that it will not retain its' hardness/
shape.

Just thought I would mention that in case you wanted to reconsider
before you get too  deep into it.

Of course, eliminating all cases that have been subjected to heat would
leave very very few, wouldnt it??

well, we'll see if it works.    and if it doesn't work I don't have much 
money into it.   so no big deal.   The pita is getting the melted stuff off 
the top of the case.
