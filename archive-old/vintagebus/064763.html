Subject: Light Switch Repair Was the Ticket

Thanks all for the advice concerning the soldering of the connections at the 
light switch.  When I removed my switch the two large red wires appeared to 
be corroded and melted together.  It was obvious they were getting real hot.  
I took the switch out, cleaned the ends of the wires and resoldered the 
riveted connections.  Put everything together and the lights are now 
definately brighter, and the switch is much cooler.  One issue I had was 
during soldering, the excess heat caused the brown housing to crack slightly. 
 I fixed that with a little super glue.  all is well.

One remaining issues concerns the grounding of the tail lights.  Does anyone 
have any pictures or procedures for doing this??  I'm not sure what would be 
easier, soldering a wire to the housing or screwing it to the housing.  I 
know this will clear up any remaining problems.
