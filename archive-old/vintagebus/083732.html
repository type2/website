Subject: Quick trip report, LA to Carson City and Return.

Over the last two weeks my family took a trip to the summer house in
Carson City.  The trip up was very uneventful.

Loaded the wife and
girls in the bus and headed up CA14 to Rosamond where we had breakfast at
The Skillet.

From there we kept up a 58MPH pace past Mojave to just south
of Pearsonville, where a Harley rider passed us and immediately pulled off
onto the shoulder whilest fiddling under his fuel tank.  I recognized the
symptoms of fuel starvation and offered him the gallon of gas I keep in a
little can for such occasions.  He was quite grateful to have his problme
solved so quickly and easily!

We headed up US 395 through Lone Pine, Independence and Big Pine to
Bishop.  Stopped to let the girls stretch their legs and feed the ducks in
the city park.  So many people feed those ducks that they stopped
migrating!

Hit the road again and started to climb the first pass, Sherwin summit.
About half way up I came across two Vanagons pulled off to the side.
Unfortunately, their problem was related to some strange liquid called
&quot;coolent&quot; that was leaking out of one of their engines, so I wasn't able
to help them.  They did seem to have some savvy people present, so we
headed up the road again.

The passes come pretty quickly on this stretch, so we climbed over
Deadman, Conway, and Devil's Gate Summits, all between 7000 and 8000 feet.
the high Sierra still shows a considerable covering of snow left over from
the heavy weather of last winter.

We managed to get across the Mojave fairly early, so the temperatures
never got much over 85 or so.

We spent almost two weeks in Carson City, cleaning, painting, etc.  Had
some nice dinners at the Nugget and other eateries.  Awfully hard to stay
on a diet in Nevada!

For the trip back, I added about 1000 pounds of load to the bus, including
a massive television, its base, and a dozen or so boxes of various stuff.
Most of the items went inside, but two boxes, the TV base, and extra spare
tire, and a 10 foot stepladder went on the roof rack.  Something told me
that the hills would be a bit slower on the way back.  I was right!

We got a reasonably early start and quickly got into the rhythm of
climbing hills at 35MPH in third.  Oddly, on the downhills the bus wasn't
all that eager to speed up.  The items on the roof rack really added to
the drag when driven over 50MPH.

The first part of the trip was at high altitude and in the morning, so the
temps were cool.  As we descended into Bishop, the mercury rose with a
vengance.  The thermometer topped 100 between Bishop and Independence.

Continuing south, we were greeted with the typical Mojave winds.  There's
a reason that they put all those wind generators in Tehachapi!  The winds
switched from the left side to the right side and back, but always seemed
to have a component in the headwind.

The bus bravely forged ahead, cruising between 50MPH and 55MPH at about
3/4 throttle.  I didn't want to push it harder, since the temperatures
continued to climb.  The thermometer read 113.5F as we drove past the
Randsburg turnoff and then started to cool to a refreshing 108F in
Palmdale.  We joined the Saturday traffic on the Antelope Valley freeway,
or rather cruised along in the slow lane while folks passed us like we
were standing still!

Made it back home to a house in the 90's and a very lush green lawn,
which I fully intend to mow one of these days.

Despite its workout, the bus didn't miss a beat.  It burned a bit more gas
than usual, which isn't surprising.

We put on a bit more than 1000 miles on this trip, including driving
around the Carson/Tahoe area.
