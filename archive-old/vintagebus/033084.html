Subject: Re:  RE: [VB] Steering Wheel Removal-another way?
To: everettb_at_thesamba_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

remove horn button   

undo the nut holding the steering wheel on, unscrew it till the top of the 
nut lines up flat with the  top of the steering shaft.

bang on it with hammer

usually works.   Wouldn't mind a stylee puller, but then again I haven't 
pulle a bus wheel in a while.  but it'd be nice

If you dont care about bashing the plasticy stuff on the old wheel to pieces, 
you can bang up from undrneath, using a two by four also helps w/aim I 
believe.

don't tighten the nt too tight when installing the wheel, and grease where it 
fits.   the VW torque should be in your bentley book
