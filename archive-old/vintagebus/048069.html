                              THE BIG NAIL

A fellow came by the shop with a dismantled engine he wanted me to
look at.  When I went out to help him haul the stuff in he said
&quot;Did you know you've got a flat?&quot;

My bus is parked up the hill from the house.  The guy had driven
past it when he arrived.  I hiked up the hill and took a look. 
Like a pancake.  I dug out the tools, jacked her up, hunkered down
and felt up the tire.  I'd picked up a nail.

I spun off the lug-bolts, pulled the wheel off, took a closer look. 
Big sucker.  16d glue-coated framer outta one of them guns -- you
could see the little alignment wires.  A few days before, I'd
picked up a little work at a local job site.  Minor stuff, mostly
digging ditches, correcting a misalignment in the machine-dug
trench for the underground utilities.  I must of picked up the nail
on the job site.  

While I was putting on the spare, the fellow heaved the flat into
my bus, helping me out.  After torquing the lug bolts and dropping
her off the jack, I heaved it out again, wobbled it down to the
shop.

&quot;Are you going to fix it?&quot;  He checked his watch in an obvious way,
more interested in getting his engine looked at than me fixing a
flat.

&quot;I'll let you watch,&quot; I said, smartassed but not entirely in jest. 
&quot;No charge.&quot;

Back at the shop I turned on the air compressor, got a pair of
vise-grips and pulled out the nail.  Then had to search around for
the plug kit.  I had my mikes all laid out, some bench space
cleared.  I'd planned to check an engine, not fix a flat.  I
eventually found the plug-kit in a drawer, exactly where it's
supposed to be.  Occasionally, I put things away.  But not often.

A nail doesn't make too big of a hole.  I selected the 5/16&quot; hollow
needle, screwed it onto the awl, lubed it up with glycerin and
started working it into the hole in the tire.  This is the hardest
part, getting that fat needle thru the puncture.  The tire still
has a lot of tread and there were an honest four plys to work
through.  The awl, which projects through the hollow steel needle
and has a matching taper, acts like a pilot.  Worked it around,
huffing and puffing, finally got the hollow needle full-depth. 

Poked around in the kit, found a 5/16&quot; plug, lubed it up good,
loaded it in the gun with its mushroom-like cap sticking out. 
Unscrewed the awl from the hollow needle and pulled it out, leaving
the hollow needle in the hole.  Screwed the plug gun into place on
the hollow needle, now serving to hold the hole open.

Pumped the handle.  Ratchety-ratchety-rat..chet..tee.. rat..  The
plug gun was compressing the rubber plug, forcing it down through
the hollow needle.  I kept working the ratchet until it was as
tight as I could get it.  When the plug was fully compressed I took
a two-handed grip on the gun, put a foot on the tire and pulled. 
Pulled it right out, hollow needle and all.  But the rubber plug
was trapped by the compression of the tire's tread.  When I pulled,
inside the tire the mushroom-shaped cap on the end of the plug came
up against the tire's casing and stopped there.  Now the hollow
needle -- tight to the gun -- pulled out of the tire and off of the
plug, leaving the bitter end of the rubber plug waving in the
breeze, like a wart on the tread of the tire.  

Start to finish, the job took mebbe two minutes.

&quot;That's really neat!&quot;  The surprise in the fellow's voice told me
he'd never seen a tire plugged before.  Live and learn.  I got out
my pocketknife and trimmed the plug flush to the tread.  I should
check the balance but I probably won't.

I pumped the tire up to sixty pounds, painted soapy water on the
plug.  No bubbles.  Flowed soapy water over the entire
circumference of the tire checking for leaks.  Nails are sold by
the pound.  Best joke in the world is fix an obvious puncture and
overlook a more subtle leak on the same tire.  But the one big nail
was all I found.  Pulled the core, deflated the tire, put it back
and pumped her up to forty-two psi, the pressure I run on the rear
tires.  Checked it for leaks again.  Okay.  Rolled it back up the
hill, put it in the bus, went back to the shop and put things away.

&quot;How much does one of those cost?  The gun-thing?&quot;

I honestly didn't know.  I guessed about ten bucks.  I've got plug
kits in most of the vehicles but prefer to use the one in the shop
because the all steel, American-made gun works better.  On the trip
to Inuvik I used the kit in the bus.  It's some kinda import crap
but it got the job done.

&quot;And it really works... &quot; he said in a tone of wonder.

&quot;Probably just a fad,&quot; I smiled.  Plug guns have been around since
the advent of tubeless tires.

We opened up his bus to get at the engine he'd brought but one
glance said it would be a waste of time to haul it into the shop. 
The align-bored case had spun #2 and was pounded out in a major
way.  There was lots of metal residue back under the lifters that
he'd missed when he cleaned it.  The crank had two dots of yellow
paint on the throw for #1.  Right beside two dots of white, telling
me it was a reground crank, twenty under on journals and mains. 
The rod journals were badly scored, the dowel pins ovaled.  It
wasn't even good for a core. 

&quot;Does that mean I can't use it?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Not in an engine.&quot;  

He frowned at that.  Reality is the biggest nail of all.  I'd just
punctured his dreams.

The lifters were trash but oddly, the cam looked near new.  I miked
the heels of the lobes.  High spec, a new part in a junk engine.

Three of the rods might be rebuildable, the fourth was visibly
bent. Both heads were cracked between the plug bores and the
valves.  On one of the heads both of the exhaust valve guide-bosses
were cracked.  Flywheel was junk -- ovaled dowel-pin holes, deep
grooves in the sealing surface.  

He said the engine was about a year old, a lo-buck rebuild from one
of the big-name rebuilders up in LA.  Based on the heads and rods,
it was junk to begin with.  I wonder how that cam got in there?

He'd paid a 'friend' $50 for the engine.  &quot;He said it was running
when he removed it.&quot;  Maybe it was. Veedubs are tough.  But with
friends like that he surely didn't need any enemies.

He'd brought along an assortment of junk yard carbs, distributors,
fuel pumps and tin-ware for me to look at, the friend having kept
all the good stuff to go on his new engine, another lo-buck piece
of crap.  One of the carbs, two distributors and one of the fuel
pumps were rebuildable.  All of the tin-ware needed repairs.  When
I pointed out the cracks he asked &quot;Is that important?&quot;  I just
smiled at him.  He wants to build an engine but just for the
experience, of course.  He was hoping to do it on the cheap using
one of those rebuild kits you see advertised in the magazines. 
What he REALLY wants to build is a Big engine, like he'd seen in
the magazines.  I suggested he consider a new, factory-built engine
instead.

He kept talking about wanting the Experience of building his own
engine.  He didn't get it.

&quot;This IS the experience,&quot; I waved the crappy head in his face. &quot;Or
part of it.  Before you can build an engine you gotta be able to
tell good parts from bad.&quot;  Something clicked.  He started to get
it.

&quot;So...  I need a pair of rebuilt heads...&quot; 

&quot;These ARE rebuilt heads.&quot;  I pointed out the crack in the guide
boss.  &quot;This one was destroyed by whoever rebuilt it.&quot;

&quot;New heads, then.&quot;

&quot;Even new heads might need work.&quot;  I took him into the shop, showed
him a pair of brand new heads, pointed out the flash blocking the
airways through the fins, the uneven height of the valve stems, a
gouge in the sealing surface around the valve gallery.  Brand new
but at least four hours of work away from being usable.  I showed
him a good rod, let him compare it to his.  Showed him a new lifter
too. By now he was looking pretty discouraged.  

&quot;You're saying none of this stuff is any good,&quot; he waved at his
collection of junk parts.

&quot;I'm not saying it.  The manual is saying it.&quot;  But I was the
translator, the bearer of bad news.

I don't charge him anything.  He was willing to pay and I'd named
a price when we made the appointment but all he has is a bus full
of dreams and some junk engine parts.  And he did help me with the
tire.

&quot;Use the money to buy yourself a plug gun,&quot; I suggested.  &quot;Fix your
own flats.&quot;

He considers it.  &quot;I'd need an air compressor.&quot; 

&quot;There's pumps...&quot; I hinted.  But I can see he'd already put the
idea aside.  Never fixed a flat but eager to build an engine.  I
wished him luck and waved him on his way.

Writing this, I looked up the price of a plug-gun kit in the J. C.
Whitney catalog.  Forty bucks.  Seems kinda high but it's been a
long time since I bought one.   

I couldn't a listing for a Dream Repair Kit.  

I'm sorry the fellow got stuck with a bunch of junk parts but when
it comes to Volkswagens, that seems to be pretty much the norm
nowadays.  It's a lot easier to fix a punctured tire than a
punctured dream.

PS -- I know there's a list of prohibitions against plugging
tubeless tires but plugs are reasonably safe for repairing simple
punctures on large diameter tires mounted on a low speed vehicle
like a VW bus.^Z
