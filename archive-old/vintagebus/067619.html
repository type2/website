Subject: Re: [VB] Hinge Covers

no, deliveries did not get rear hinge covers.

but a 64 standrad or deluxe would have minty green ones to match the stylee 
minty green headliner and minty green sun visors.   Oh, boy, that is such a 
pretty interior.

have

 &gt; &gt; My turquoise bus has/had white hinge covers.
