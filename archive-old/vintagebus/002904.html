Rob,

Whew! So many questions...   I'll try my best to address them all.

Yes, repro front skins are available, but I do not have any personal
experience with them, so therefore cannot testify as to their quality.
According to Mark Lapriore of &quot;Busses for Driving&quot; replacing the front skin
is fairly straightforward.  You will need to make one cut along the bottom
of the windshield sills, and the other 3 edges are allegedly only crimped
on.  You can even buy special tools to crimp and un-crimp these seams.
Probably you can get one cheaply from &quot;Henry Tool Supply&quot; or your local
equivalent.

The going rate for a good used one? Well, about a year ago I sold a cherry
front clip for 150$, but I do live in the Midwest, and mebbe I ripped the
dude off, mebbe he ripped me off, I don't know.  But he was happy with the
deal.

I'm not sure of the year, but at some point the shape of the headlight
bucket changed...  Me thinks about '63 off the top 'o the noggin, but I'm
probably wrong...  Anyone else care to take a crack,   Clara?  Also the
shape of the corners of the &quot;Dash Pod&quot; changed from sharper corners up top,
to more curvy ones.

Yes, I think it is easier to get a clip section with a dash attached.. at
least all the ones I've come across have the dash.  Another difference in
the dash besides the pod shape is the shape and the size of the cutouts for
the parcel tray.   Earlier T2's had a thinner bend over the front edge of
the tray.

The defroster switch you are referring too sounds more like the toggle for
the rear dome light.  Does it have a little aluminum bezel and a cream
colored plastic switch?  If so, that is the dome light.  Not sure but I
don't think rear defrosters were available until '68, but I have seen them
added on by PO's.

my car will still be a classic, your will just be OLD.&quot;

Protect me from the things I want.    Leave now, sleep when you get there.
