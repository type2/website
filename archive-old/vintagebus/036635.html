Hey,

	I don't think this particular question was ever answered.

	I know of the pros and cons of swapping the entire front beam.

	BUT, there is also the option of just swapping out the torsion arms.
&gt;From Link/King Pin to Ball Joint.

	What is the opinion on this particular 'conversion'. (Besides &quot;Don't
Do IT&quot;)

	Does the modified Torsion arms conversion increase ride height like
the beam swap?

	Whaddya think?

	Eventually, I'll call Bus-Boys and find out more info......
