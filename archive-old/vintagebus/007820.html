Subject: Leaking Reduction box

Hi peoples...

I recently installed a new seal kit in my left reduction box to stop a minor
but significant leak.  I failed.  Why did I fail?  Should I be using
sealant?  How does the fact that oil was still dripping slowly but surely
down the sealing face of the gasket and brake plate affect things?  I did
torque the four bolts to spec per Bentley....what might I have missed?

It's a '66, BTW

Thanks,
Gene
