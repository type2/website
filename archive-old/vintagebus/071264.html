Subject: Re: [VB] Apartment dweller

At the end of the ZebraSafari expedition
(www.zebrasafari.co.za), I met a fellow in Frankfurt who had
a complete single-seater racing car in the lounge of his
fourth floor apartment.

He carried it up the stairs part by part and reassembled it
in his apartment. When I met him his girlfriend had just
left him; apparently something to do with all the car parts
in his apartment.

The first time my (now ex-)wife visited me at home, I had a
pair of cylinder heads that I was overhauling in the kitchen
sink!
