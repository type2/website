Subject: Bus club donations.

You guys rock!
Our club, the Gorge VW club does the same thing. We raised $800 our first
year and $1000 this past year. For this coming season we have a 1975
Porsche 914 to raffle off. All proceeds go to charity. We would probably
fall into that bondo, rust, duct tape category ourselves but we are
starting to get some nicer cars in the club. We donate our funds to an
organization called the Next Door and they provide all sorts of services
for troubled teens. It feels really good when you hear back what your money
has done. One of these days I will make it down to the BBB. You can check
out our web site at http://www.amz_dot_com/gorgevwclub/
