Concerning bartering, the only rule is that there are no rules.

However, if you are a member of a society (such as a bus list) and wish to
remain in the good graces of the society, then there are some courtesy
guidelines that you should follow.

You should do what you say that you will.  You should do this promptly.

You should be honest about the part being offered.  Condition and
applicability should be described as accurately as possible.

If you get a part and find that it isn't the part that you need, you
should discuss this with the supplier, but you shouldn't expect the other
party to undo the deal because you made a mistake.  Chalk it up to
experience!

Few deals go perfectly, and there are crooks out there.  Know the people
you are dealing with.  Simply being on the list a long time doesn't mean
that a person is trustworthy.

Do everything you can to resolve a conflict before going to the list with
it.  About all you do when you bring your problem to the list is to let us
know about somebody who shouldn't be trusted.  The problem with this is
the same as divorce: there are two sides to every story.  Many times,
disputes of this sort result in both parties being perceived as
untrustworthy.
