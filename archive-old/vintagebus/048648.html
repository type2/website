Subject: 59 Kombi in TX found! pt.2 (long)
Message-Id: &lt;mR/10jQsI-0007sZR_at_mail.airmail_dot_net&gt;

One day while searching the Internet for my first VW bus, I came across an
ad in the Austin.forsale newsgroup for a '59 Kombi for $900. I quickly
called the guy up. He tells me he just posted the ad 5 minutes ago. He goes
on to tell me how he had the bus for a while, blew the engine, had a
rebuilt one put in, then parked it after the accelerator pedal went to the
floor. He says the wheel wells were cut and the outside was brush painted
with house paint. He also tells me the bus was in the movie &quot;Michael&quot; if I
want to take a look at it. Off I went to Austin to check out the bus. I
talk to Rob Strobo for a while and try to get the bus for $500. That's
really what it was worth. He says the lowest he can go is $700. I
reluctantly pay it and tow the bus back to San Angelo.

After getting home, I put a temporary fix on the accelerator cable, change
the points, and put a new battery in the bus. Starts right up. I drive it
around the neighborhood. Over the next couple of weeks I take breaks from
the bug restoration I'm doing to &quot;tool&quot; around the neighborhood. Then the
bus dies. Needs a new generator.

The bus has a very distinctive personality. Feels like your friend. And
yes, has a very distinctive (but comfortable) smell! I decide to go ahead
and strip the paint, replace the wheel wells and cargo floor, and make the
bus into a nice daily driver. I go ahead and make a web page to follow the
resto. Kind of a &quot;modern scrapbook&quot;.

Many months later while stripping the paint I came across red and white
colors on the body. The lines were in strange places, so I'm thinking maybe
it was a delivery van. When I get to the front doors, I run into blue. OK,
maybe the door is off of another bus. Then I figure it out...it's the old
red, white, and blue. About a week later there's a post on the vintagebus
list by Craig K looking for his old '59 Kombi. He says it had been painted
like the American Flag and goes on to describe other details that make me
sure I've got his bus!

Now I've got a picture of the bus when it was red, white, and blue on my
site as well as a good amount of history that I can ad too. Thanks to Craig
K via the Vintagebus Mailing List! Now, if I could just find Eric The
Scooter Guy, maybe I could find out a little more.

So...ATTN TX listees! Looking for Eric The Scooter Guy!
