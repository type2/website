I don't understand what's so opressive about a law that keeps people from 
turning their front yard into a junkyard.

If you choose to live in a neighborhood (it is YOUR choice, afterall) where 
junked cars on the street and in your yard are frowned upon, then have the 
*common courtesy* not to have junk in your yard or on on the street.  If 
you want to have 50 busses in various states of disrepair, then simply MAKE 
A CHOICE to live in a place where that's OK.  It's not rocket science.

It's incumbent upon you to live up to the standards of the neighborhood you 
choose to live in.  Now, before I get publically defiled for being a 
communist, let me just say that I DO love a good project, but I choose to 
keep it in my shop, not in my yard.  I would hope my neighbors would do the 
same.

&gt;Or don't move, and get the laws changed. Fight for your essential
&gt;freedoms, and don't let others dictate your property rights. It is your
&gt;property, fight to regain control of it. Petitioning is a good start, as
&gt;is fighting against zoning law in any form. Also look to your local
&gt;libertarian party/libertarian oriented politicians for help getting rid of
&gt;these oppressive laws.
