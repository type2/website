Subject: Re: [VB] Reading up on stuff on the 1961 and have a few light
  questions!

these lines show where the pieces of metal are stuck together to make a bus.  
Take you book in havnd and go round the bus and compare.  The corner was 
pressed as one piece of metal to he roof- the lines show where the seams are. 
  I  think you also are shown the neat way the edges are joined together at 
the seams, sometimes in a complicated bend for strength. 

Remember they think you can go grab an NOS piece of metal off the pile to fix 
your bus.  But you can still replace the lower corner and hide the seam under 
the beltline trim.

 Also in the same section but A-11 page 1-5 shows body cutting lines.   Are
 these the lines that VW used when putting the panels together and the dot 
dash
 dot lines are the panels that are under the dash dash dash lines?  There is 
no
 description with these pages and just kind of stumped me!  If you were to 
want
 to replace the corners would you need to replace them all the way to the roof
 line like they show in this drawing?   &gt;&gt;
