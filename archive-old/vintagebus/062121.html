Subject: Re: [VB] Need &lt;63 door handle 

I too would like to find a 63 type ignition switch.  61 to 63 to be precise, 
for my 61.  push on terminal.  I gave my last one to my dad to get rekeyed 
for his truck.  recently had a key fit and want one key for the 61.  or maybe 
I should just put the steering lock in and not worry about it.   I have a ton 
of L series ignitions, and some screw terminal 55-60 ignition switches, and 
some Ts (some have keys).

 &gt; This is a '62 crew cab, and unfortunately the driver's exterior handle has 
 &gt; no lock cylinder in it. So, I need one of those handles, preferably with 
 &gt; key, but without is ok as well.
 
 Hi Richard,
 Driver exterior handle should be easy to find.  Check for Gabriel who does 
 lock work for VWs in the archives.
 
 &gt;&gt; I also need an early ignition switch, as mine is the later style, which 
 has a &gt; different key.
 
 That is going to be alot harder!  We could not find one of those in usable 
 condition for our 1963 SC and had to pull the NOS one we had on the shelf.  
 Probably was the last NOS one on the planet....
 
  I would like to have the whole truck on 1 key if not too &gt; expensively 
 &gt; possible. 
 
 Gabriel can do that and he knows how to repin the tool bay door/s for SCs.
