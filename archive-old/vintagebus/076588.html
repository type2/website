Subject: MC woes

After installing a 68 ball joint beam on my 67 split with a late bay front
disks setup I am now curious as to what brake mastercylinder to run?
Some say go servo assist which sounds like a lot a fettling about with
vacume hoses etc - others have suggested a non servo bay M/C will suffice
with just a firmer feeling peddle?
The rear end will be a creative engineering IRS setup with with late bay
hubs and drums .I have read some good articles on single to dual circuit M/C
upgrades but non seem to address this particular issue?
