Subject: Re: [VB] '65 Wiper Motor

yes, for some reason that's a hard wiring diagram to find.  I think it is in 
teh Bentley, I think.  the wiring is different, as the wiper motor is self 
parking (unlike the 64 and earlier) and one speed (unlike the 66/67).  why did 
you replace the armature, just wondering.   

to bench test it, clamp a ground to the motopr or frame, and Is there a brown 
wiring in the wiring harness?   then it need two grounds.  There is one hot 
to the self parking prong, and hot when wiping to the other prong.  Hope this 
helps.

Do you have a 65 wiper motor in it?

I replaced the armature in the wiper motor in my bus this weekend. 
Unfortunately it doesn't work now at all. It just gets hot and starts to smell! I really 
hope I fried it! I just love throwing cash away!
I have looked around for wiring diagrams but am unable to find one for my 
bus. The pre-66 diagrams show the wiper motor as having 2 wires and mine has 
three; and the switch as only having 2 wires and I have at least 4. It worked fine 
before the volt drop I had busted.
