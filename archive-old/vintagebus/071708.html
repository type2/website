Subject: Re: [VB] oil temps

----- Original Message -----
&gt; Temps run 240-260 and scares me to the point of pulling over for a cool
down.
&gt; I will soon add an oil cooler/wfan.
&gt; Are these temps TOO high? Should I be SKEERED!!

240-260 is waaaaay to high for my liking.

If my oil hits 230, i'm slowing down or pulling over.

Driving into a headwind that slowed us to 45-50 mph (while floored) put my
oil temps at 220. Cruising 65mph _at_ 4000 rpm on a normal day puts my oil temp
at about 215 after it's fully warmed up.

My setup is:
All german cooling tin, no cheap aftermarket stuff.
Full thermostat and Flaps operating
Removed doghouse oil cooler and blocked it off. (as an experiment, seems to
be just fine)
Running a simple &quot;tube and fin&quot; style cooler without a fan
Oil thermostat to keep the oil warm in cool weather.

Also remember, if you add a bunch of oil cooling to your engine to get the
temps down, then you can still overheat. I've personally burned up a motor
in a bus, and my oil temps never got over 200 degrees. Big ol' oil cooler
with a fan kept the oil temps in line, but cylinder heads baked because I
continued to push the motor since it wasn't &quot;overheating&quot;.

Going soley by oil temp (which is always very close to case temp as well) to
determine if you are overheating can be trouble. Don't overdo the oil
cooling, or you might end up hiding the heat the heads are making.
