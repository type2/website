I bought my engine from Bugformance in Sacramento CA. They built it in
their shop, I actually met the builder, used a new Brazil case and
heads but the crank, rods and cam are reground German. I think it was
about $1100 for 1600dp longblock with 12 month warranty and a couple
of head retorques and valve adjustments included. I've driven it a
little over 1000 miles and it runs strong, cool, and doesn't leak oil!
That I am still getting over. I am real happy with it and would buy
from them again. They are real nice volks there, know my name, know my
bus, always friendly and willing to give me free advice and opinions.
Hope this helps,
Joel
