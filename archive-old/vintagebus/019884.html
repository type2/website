&gt;  Most people that I know that DRIVE there buses on road trips and in
&gt;caravans all have CB'S. The person leading, at least one in the middle and
&gt;always at the end. That way if someone is having problems or just to chit
&gt;chat, there always in comunication.

I know that the SV2s guys down south use CBs a lot in caravans.  I've got a 
CB in my Bus up north here, but our chapter relies more on those FRS 
handheld radios than CBs.  I only prefer CBs because they've more range 
than the FRS...and no batteries to change.  :)
