I don't know if my second message went through, but I wanted to mention that
since your muffler was less than an inch off, it might be better to just bend
the pipes of the muffler to fit.  Heat as mentioned before to get flanges to
the right plane.

It appears that the previous owner installed some spacers between the
case and cylinders. This is complicating my plans to use a stock
muffler and stock 34 pict carb on 1600 dual port. It appears that
the spacing between the #2 and #4 exhaust ports is 3/16&quot; too wide.

I'd appreciate any suggestions as to how to stretch the muffler and
heat riser tube to fit. I'd rather not go dual carbs and extractor
exhaust.
