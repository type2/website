Subject: Trying to revamp my 1776???
Date: Thu, 25 Jan 2001 12:36:33 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

After discussing engine theory with Lou down in Havasu and driving a
couple of healthy 1776 engines (John Howard's and Ronnie's), I've come
to the conclusion that I need to do some immediate changes to my bus
engine.

First of all, I'm tired of my engine puking oil.  I will solve this
problem by listening to the advice that the list told me way back when
and get rid of the Melling pump and switch to new stock.  Next off, my
case that Painter's Grinding did a 60/80 cut on (why in the hell a
reputable place would consider boring a case out that big is beyond me)
is either going to be replaced with a new case or one of my used ones
that I will have a reputable machinist and good friend in Lincoln look
at.

The other change I'm going to make is to get rid of my CB044 heads.  I
never told the list this but I had more power and snap with the stock
heads and even with the leaky cylinder.  I'm thinking of going back to
the Engle 100 cam but can anyone tell me what the difference between the
100 and 110 are?  I think that the 100 would be more of an &quot;RV&quot; grind
where the torque is induced at lower RPM.  These are things Lou and I
discussed and after driving Ronnie's 1776SP with 100 cam, I know for a
fact his bus would simply blow mine away.  My power comes on way too
high and this really shouldn't surprise anyone.
I'm thinking that a head that has slightly bigger valves would be the
ticket.  I keep hearing that 041 and 042 heads are junk so is there a
head out there that is a little bit better than stock or would a set of
3 angle stock heads work for me?  I tend to think that opening up the
ports mildly would help but the 044's are just too big and I've lost my
port velocity at lower RPM's.  I think I've finally learned something -
the velocity through the ports is important.  If you open up the ports
on an engine that doesn't have much displacement to start with, then the
power comes on higher.  Maybe I'm stupid but it seems to be making
sense.

The T4 project is still in the works - I haven't given up on it at all.
I just need to get a bus ready for a road trip that runs dry (no leaks)
and fixes the glitches that are bugging the daylights out of me.  Every
trip I take peppers the backside of my bus with oil and I'm losing it
out of the OP sender hole with bunged threads.

So I think I can get away moving my parts over to another case by doing
the following:

New bearings for the cam and crank
New or good used case (with the align/thrust bore that is within
reason.)
stock oil pump
sell off the CB heads for a set of good stock or mildly improved heads
(the CB heads have a little over 3,000 miles on them and I'm willing to
trade straight across for the heads I'm looking for.)
new gasket stuff and aviation permatex the case halves together.
New cam if the list things a 100 would work better.  The 110 I had with
stock heads sure had a lot of snap though.
Since the engine runs so cool, I'm thinking of bumping compression up a
notch like 7.1 or 7.2 instead of 6.9

I know all this engine crap of mine gets old (tell me about it) but I'm
thinking of doing a road trip this summer and would at least like to
have a bus I could trust.  Right now, I don't.
