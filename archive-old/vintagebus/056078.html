Subject: Re: [VB] somebody stop me

Thats the great thing about living in the sticks, hell we're still allowed
to burn brush! I've wanted a trailer but that means paying twice as much
each way on the ferry. Found an early 60's tiltcab with a rampbed for a
bunch less. Besides you never know when a friend might need you to haul a
backhoe;)

&gt; Concur!  My trailer was more like $2500 including the electric brake
&gt; set up for my truck, tiedowns, and a winch.  I have probably only
&gt; used it 10 times or so thus far, but I also consider it money well
&gt; spent.
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, the City has decided that I am not allowed to store my
&gt; trailer (and assorted busses) on my vacant lot, so now I have to find
&gt; a warehouse or something!  (The humorous part of the story is that
&gt; the City wanted to rent my lot for City storage while downtown
&gt; sidewalks were being repaired!)

&gt; &gt;That's exactly why I just put up the cash for a trailer. I got a NEW
&gt; &gt;16 ft. double axle trailer with ramps for around $850.00. Funny
&gt; &gt;thing is used ones don't sell for much cheaper than that around
&gt; &gt;here. Made sense for me and much safer. I've gotten way more than my
&gt; &gt;money back on it. I use it all the time for stuff other than hauling
&gt; &gt;VW's. I help friends retrieve VW's as well. Even towed my brothers
&gt; &gt;'55 Ch*vy 2-door home on it. Money well spent.
