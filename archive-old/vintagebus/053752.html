Subject: Re: Double Cab canvas--

I'm just trying to help some people--If you do not want this --that's fine.
I have seen the product and have done a lot of research about material that
will be subjected to the stress of going on down the road.--For my 1960DC it
will be VWonderful--as to the Vintage Nazi VW Bus People I suppose it will
never be correct,--But materials have greatly improved since the 60s. I am
awaiting the results, and will reserve my final judgement when that time
comes. The product will then be available off of my 1960DC--People then will
see exactly what they are getting--If no one wants the product,--then no one
gets hurt. it's as simple as that----Sorry you are so displeased--, uj
