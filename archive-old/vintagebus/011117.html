when it stops raining-- how do i check for this?
you see, the p o fitted a 68 front beam..... not sure what he did to the
master cylinder - or what cylinder from what he used.
it's not under my feet, with access to the reservoir by the pedals.. but now
(whatever it is) it's fitted somewhere else with the reservoir inside the
storeage hole thing (never know what thats called) under the bench seat.

I've no idea what has been done here - so this might be a cause of the
trouble - but its only sticking on the one drum now. so wouldn't this
make sense that the master cylinder is ok?

anyone have an idea what master cylinder he might have used, and is it usual
to move it on fitting a 68 bj beam to a 60 split?

I don't know about usual, but I had a 59 truck last year, and it had a 68
beam and a dual circuit master cylinder (no stock, from a 68  ish I think
bus) which was located under the seat.    Kinda a pain to put fluid into.
Had to lift the bottom of the seat up, which meant lifting the back of it out.
..........
also, what do i look for with the freeplay /rod length?

look in your bentley guide-  there is a certain amount the rod should move
before actually pushing the master sylinder.    But if this was off it would
affect al brakes evenly.

possible symptoms of bad flex hoses...

they can collapse inside, which makes the
brakes drag  ie fluid goes out, but is not let back towards the MC
when you bleed it little or no fluid comes out (as opposed to a good squirt)

sometimes it will intermittantly open/collapse inside, making the brake at
that wheel intermittantly work, giving the bus a weaving motion as you trying
to stop.

visually, any cracks or bulges and they are way over due for replacement.


if is is burst the MC will be empty and you have no brakes  (single circuit
Master Cylinder)

if you have a dual MC and a hose burst, one side of the MC will be empty and
your brakes won't be as good as they should be.

they can collapse inside.

if they are over 5 years old or so I would just replace them.   Good safety
move.    Usually they are overlooked and are due for replacement.   Flushing
the brake system completely every year extends the life of your brake parts,
BTW.

I learned about hoses when one went bad on my first splitty, and the brakes
dragged, caught on fire .    The brake still worked, so we kept driving.
soon after that the hose burst, leaving the brake pedal useless.   It had
done the weaving braking motion for a while beforehand, but I didn't know to
check for hoses- I check the shoes etc.   Even seen a 65 bus that was taken
to a shop for a complete brake job, recently, and they missed the hoses, one
of which had a bulge that looked like it was about to burst.  Bus brakes
better after it had new hoses.  Funny about that.
