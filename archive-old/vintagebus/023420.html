On my engine lid, the right side hinge has separated from the hinge...

I'm wanting a quick repair that isn't a lot of work... I'd rather spend
reasonable money than take on another project :)

In finding a replacement, should I be concerned about the year -- or the
fact this is a truck vs. a bus?  It does have a light over the license plate
(even works)...

Going rate?  Anyone have a perfect one to sell?  A not perfect one that you
would be willing to make perfect and sell?

I am also seeking all new hinges, both body and lid sides... someone
indicated to me that NOS ones were going for $20 a pair?

Thanks to all.
