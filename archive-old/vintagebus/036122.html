&gt;  &gt;My question relates to the factory colors of the wheels ..... &gt;correct 
&gt; has
&gt;  yet to be validated. The specific wheel color still eludes me.
&gt;  &gt;wanted to know if any of you have tried colors from any of these companies
&gt;  and found them to be close enough to stock that a difference cannot be
&gt;  
&gt;  easily seen.
&gt;  
&gt;  So far comon thought for Silver Weiss matching powder coat color is either
&gt;  Traffic White (RAL 9016)
&gt;  or
&gt;  Signal White (RAL 9003)
&gt;  Altho Someone mailed me that they thought Signal white seemed to bright.
&gt;  Oh and then theres Clara's 'mystery' color she used, which was a damn 
'close
&gt;  match'. But for some reason she wouldnt release the information to us.
