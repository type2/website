 &gt; 5)Should I shoot one panel at a time, or shoot the whole vehicle... I
 &gt; received permission to leave it in the shop overnite for the duration,
 &gt; and have been lucky so far.. no components missing yet.
 
 Shoot the whole car. Shoot the top first, wait overnight, shoot the bottom.

this is what I did with the 65 westy. though I thought later I should have 
painted the lower colour first, then the upper, if I was doing it the OG way  

also, I did not take it down to bare metal, but I did do that with where the 
rock chips had gone through the paint and started rust spots.   Still looks 
good 3 years later.   Feather out where you take it to metal,   I took most 
of the nose down, and chips on the sides.
