Hi all,
Just thought I would let everyone know URL for the Full Moon Bus Club in the
Southeast U.S  is now http://www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_com

Bus content
Also for anyone attempting to remove the door mirror hinge pin on a split: If
it is seized try a lot of kroil for days.  Take the door off the hinges
completely (put something in the holes before you remove the last bolts to
hold the inner plate up) Support under the hinge, have someone else hold the
rest of the door and whack away with a 5 LB sledge or larger.  Mine was so
seized it took almost two hours and bloody fingers (don't miss) to remove the
pin.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
