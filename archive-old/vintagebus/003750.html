Subject: Re: [VB] How much oil?

I ran an external oil cooler and filter setup for several years on a 1600SP
engine.  The highly trained and experienced AC VW technician who built the
engine and installed the system showed me how it was possible to check the
oil level _with the engine running_.  I soon worked out just how much oil
that system needed at oil change time, but early on it was reassuring to be
able to pull the dipstick with the engine fully warmed up and idling and
check the oil level.

That particular setup took 4 full quarts of oil because of the filter,
hoses, and cooler - actually at least a pint less than I had anticipated.
With the engine warm and idling, you could pull the dipstick, wipe it,
reinsert it quickly and then pull it to check.  The correct oil level was at
or slightly below the full mark on the dipstick.  At idle speed [850 to
1,000 RPM] there wasn't any problem with oil coming out of the dipstick
hole.

We never bothered with pre-filling the filter, etc. when changing oil and
filter.  Just swapped filters, added 4 qts. 30W Castrol, and started and ran
the engine at idle speed for a few minutes before double-checking the level
in the crankcase.  The engine would be thoroughly warmed before draining the
oil, so it started and idled smoothly after the change.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I don't know really how much oil I should put in the bus now that there
is a spin-on filter attached to it.  I know to fill up the filter before I
put it on, but then there's a little over four feet of oil-line to fill up,
too.  Should I put the oil in the lines before attaching the hoses?  Or
should I measure how much oil the hoses hold, and add that much to the 3.5
quarts in the engine?  Maybe I'm paranoid, but I want to do it right :-)  &lt;&lt;
