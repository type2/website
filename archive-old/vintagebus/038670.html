I need some mesh platinum seat covers for our '67 bus. So far I have found
two choices. Lenny's West Coast Classics and TMIs. Wolfsburg West is also
selling the reproduced interioirs but I am not sure if they are reselling
Lenny's, TMI's or are doing there own. Has anyone seen or purchased either
of these reproduced mesh platinum seat covers or interior panels? How close
is the color and the texture? I am not doing a 100 point resto but since
these vedors have a hefty price tag I might as well go for the best.
