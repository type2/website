Thanks for posting the link Rex.  As I recall, the original page was hosted
on a compuserve account.  A tear came to my eye when I read about Josh's
plans for the next big road trip - BBTB in Lake Havasu City, AZ. One of
these days I'll be able to make that trip in his honor even if I have to fly
down there in order to do it.  Does anyone ever know what happened to the
Stars 'n' Stripes Westy?  I think it would rock to drive the bus to an event
as kind of a Josh Rodger's memorial bus.  It would make sure that we
wouldn't forget him.

I've always said that we should have a website to memorialize our fallen
comrades.  As time goes on, more and more will be added.  I remember Josh,
Scott Yuppa from the vintagvw listserv, Kirsten - the young girl they found
at an Arkansas rest area brutally murdered.  I don't have enough webspace
that would allow a memorial like this but I'm sure that if few of us worked
together, we could put together something no matter how simple it is.
