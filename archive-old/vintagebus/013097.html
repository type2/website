&gt; &quot;on the bottom/front lip of the front bow, there should be a thin bead of
&gt; rubber weatherstrip that goes bewteen the metal bow and the cover fabric. When
&gt; the sunroof is closed, this hidden weatherstrip forms the seal at the front of
&gt; the sunroof to keep water fro blowing in while you drive&quot;

I used adhesive backed foam weatherstripping.

&gt; Also does anyone know where to get a correct headliner for this year of bus?
&gt; The original headliner looks to be made out of tufted cotton (is it called
&gt; &quot;mousefluff&quot;???) I would like to find as close to a correct headliner. 

I don't think any of the places make anything other than vinyl.
