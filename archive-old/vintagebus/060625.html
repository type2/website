&gt; I can't figure out why my #3 and #4 aren't firing very hot.  The engine 
&gt; seems to be running mostly on the #1 and #2 cylinders.  When I pull the #1 
&gt; or #2 plug wire from the distributor while its running, the engine 
&gt; noticably reacts, but if I pull the #3 or #4 wires barely anything.  I 
&gt; readjusted the valves and they were tight on #3 and #4.  

Hi Charles,
Sounds like a vaccum leak or if using dual carbs a carb problem on that side.
