I converted my 64 Bug to an alternator and it was necessary to use a 
different fuel pump due to clearance problems and I would assume that the 
same would apply to a bus but haven't done that yet.  The fuel pump had a 
lower profile than the pump used with a generator and required the use of a 
shorter push rod for driving the pump itself.
