&gt; My bus isn't yellow, but my kids used to brag to their friends that they

For those not in the ed biz, the &quot;short bus&quot; usually refers to the smaller
bus (usually equipped with a wheelchair lift and staffed with aides) that
brings the handicapped and developmentally-disabled students to
the school.  The usage can be kind or cruel, so please be careful how you
use it!
