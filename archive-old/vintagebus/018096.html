i'll try to take a look at mine this weekend...currently i still have both of
them. The one on the gas cap 
door works properly, the one to the engine compartment is kind of stuck in the
open position. the 
spring is still in there, so it springs back and forth...it just doesn't stop
in the right spot. i bought a 
replacement, but it was such thin piece of crap, i never replaced it.  your
question may be the 
incentive to try and fix the one i have...although i am a little worried about
breaking it..
