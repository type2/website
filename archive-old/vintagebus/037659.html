Subject: Choices to be made...	

Thanks all for the outpouring of advice on the 6v/12v dilemma.  I think I may
try and go with the double 6v battery set up...at least that's the way i'm
leaning at this moment.  One last question...I've noticed in the Rocky Mt.
Motorworks catalog that there are halogen bulbs for the 6v crowd.._dot_can anyone
offer a comparison....is a 6v halogen brighter than a 12v standard?  It would be
lovely to see where I'm going....of course, that would be true for all of
us...in an existential way....

Looking for illumination,
