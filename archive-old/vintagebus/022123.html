One thing I for got to mention is that there may be a difference in the
vent holes in the lower oil bath bowl between the 36hp &amp; the bastard
40hp version...  I'll check my '57 Kombi tonight.

And Neil &amp; I have had the &quot;bastard 36hp&quot; vs. &quot;bastard 40hp&quot; arguement
before &amp; I stand my ground on &quot;bastard 40hp&quot;.  The bastard has MUCH
more in common with the 40hp than the 36hp.

I just love using curse words...  bastard, bastard, bastard!

Dave
