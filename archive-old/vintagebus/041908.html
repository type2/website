&gt; &gt; metal!  We are planning to cut and weld into all our buses the nut plates 
&gt; &gt; from post-1967 buses to prevent what is called submarining which 
&gt; &gt; pushes/twists you shoulder and back down due to the incorrect lower angle of 
&gt; &gt; the belt when mounted into the front seat backing sheet metal.
&gt; Actually,
&gt; 
&gt; Submarining is when you slide out of your seatbelt into the
&gt; footwell...  Picture the seatbelt being the waterlevel and your body being
&gt; a submarine submerging.  Racers put an anti-submarining strap between
&gt; their legs...
&gt; 
&gt; What happens when you have the seatbelt anchor below your shoulder i know
&gt; not a name for, but if you hit something hard enough that belt will crush
&gt; your shoulder like a twig and cut into you in a very damaging manner.

It's called &quot;spinal compression&quot;  Very nasty, that!

The rule of thumb is that the shoulder belt should not be more than 10
degrees below the horizontal behind your shoulder, and it is much better
to be well above the horizontal.  Some cars, like convertables, make
shoulder harness installation rather difficult.
