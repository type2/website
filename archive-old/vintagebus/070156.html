&gt; Where's Nisqually Wrecking?  Is that the one at Martin &amp; Carpenter?

Hi Randy, Carla &amp; Anna Huyck,
No it is the wrecking yard far North of there that if you go anyfarther North 
on Martin (Wrecking yard is on East side of the road.) you are at the 
Nisqually refuge and the last Northern exit/onramp to I-5 from the Olympia 
area.
