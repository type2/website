Suffice to say that somewhere in the world, a friend of mine has stumbled
across a pretty large stash of VW parts - many of them NOS.  Here for your
enjoyment are a few pictures of this stuff.  There is a lot more than what
is depicted in the photos such as NOS seat covers, original Hella (with
german sticker) backup light switches that attach to speedometers, NOS
German fender welting in color, Bosch bus 4500 rpm limiting rotors, T3
sheetmetal including fenders, and the list goes on and on.  Enjoy the
pictures! :-)  (And what looks like rust is actually a red oxide paint that
VW put on the parts to prevent rust.  Underneath it all is good stuff!)
