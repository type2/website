Subject: Re: [VB] What is the toughest climb you ever 

  Although not a long drive, the one from Denver to 
Golden, CO was very steep (and HIGH). It didn't help 
that the '62 was loaded up to the gills for our 
transcontinental camping adventure at the time. In 
Golden we took the tour of the Coors brewery which, at 
the end dumps you into their free bar. They encouraged 
us to take the drive FARTHER up the mountain (oh my) 
along a twisty road with huge drop offs and snow to see 
the final resting place of Buffalo Bill and visitor 
center. It has a breathtaking view and we had an equally 
breathtaking decent &gt;8^0 (That decent would make anybody 
glad they I had switched to dual circuit!).
   Second place goes to Eastbound 70 out of Denver to 
Abilene KS. I know, technically there are NO hills in 
Kansas (which is why it only takes 2nd), but there was 
the kind of wind that make it as slow going as any steep 
grade. I had to brace myself against the corner of the 
seat and the door and wrestle the wheel with both hands 
(it was tornado season). Try that workout for a 10 hours 
through a mind-numbingly boring drive!

I'm ready to go again!
