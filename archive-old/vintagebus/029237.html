Everyday I get more excited about finally making a journey in Frodo my
65 Westy. I have had it 3 years next month and have been looking forward
to this since I first saw her sitting in the farmers field. Since the
restoration was completed late this summer this will be my longest trip
outside of Omaha. I plan on meeting up with NQ in St Joe MO Friday
morning and togeather traveling across  northern MO on Hiway 36. If
anyone is heading that way on Friday we would love to have you join us.
Pmail me for details( as soon as NQ and I get them worked out)

As for the title of the message. Are there any vendors planning on being
there and or having things for sale? I would like to put in a quick
order for some small parts.

See y'all in the woods
