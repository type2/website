Subject: Tapping tip . . vacuum cleaning

 This talk of drilling and tapping on a running engine . . .

 Take a piece of that clear tygon tubing, 1/4&quot; worked for me . .

 Stick about a foot down the neck of the vacuum cleaner . . .

 Now plug the leak there with a rag . . don't pinch the hose . .

 Now you can vacuum the full length of that oil galley . .

 or get in the combustion chamber with the same setup . .

 Explaining to your SO how clever you are wandering around with
only one sock on while the other is down the vacuum . .

 That takes real brilliance . . . :-)
