Subject: Homebrew tow bar

Anyone out there ever built their own bus tow bar? I am seriously considering
doing this in the next couple of days. I would like to be able to tow mostly
bay windows, the first one would be a 1972 that I am purchasing. I have a
welder (my dad), tools, and all but just need some advice.  I can buy the
reciever hitch thingy at the FLAPS, but I would love any advice or Definitely
DO's or Definitelty NOT DO's from people who have done this successfully.
Did you use angle iron steel, steel pipes, how did you set up for attachement
to the frame of the bus being towed, etc. etc.

Peace, John Baker
