I found a 66 21 window for sale in my fair city. i looked at it. i drove it.
i was very tempted by it. but then, a day later or so, reality set in and i
realized that i have to finish the dormo. so i showed it to my friend. he
looked at it. he drove it. he IS very tempted by it. it's been 3 days. he
still wants it. he can't stop thinking about driving it in the summer. he' s
got the fever. it has $8000 of drivretrain work! so, needless to say that it
runs flawlessly (it better for $8k!). It has two bench seats. whether
they're original is debatable (i think the middle one is, but i KNOW the
rear one isn't). The bus has plywood NAILED to the cargo floor. all the
upholstry needs replacment or repair. And the bottom 3 inches are rotted
away. it can still hold a battery, and the rest of the bus is fine (as far
as rust). Now keep in mind that this ain't too bad for a MN bus. On the plus
side, it does have a new canvas top, and all of the trim (except on the
bumpers). No clock. The roof windows need new seals. The guy wants $4000 for
it. He's not really a VW guy (he's a Dead fan), but he knows 21's are
desired. My friend offered him $2500. He talked himself down to $3000. We
walked. I told my friend to show up on his doorstep in a month or so with
$2500 in cash in one hand and in the other? A bunch of Grateful Dead
bootlegs. Your thoughts?

p.s. -sorry this is so long.
