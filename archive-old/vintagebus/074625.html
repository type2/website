Subject: Plans for a Camper Interior

Hi all,

I have been on the search for a while now for information on building your 
own camper interior for a split-window bus, and though I have found some 
info on bay-window buses, I have mostly come up sort.  Does anyone out there 
have plans, blueprints, photos, or anything relating to building your own 
camper interior?  I am interested in at least making my own self-contained 
kitchen unit, but I would also love to know how to build cabnetry and other 
such goodies inside my bus.

Looking forward to any advice you all have . . .
