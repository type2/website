Subject: Re: [VB] Porsche Pulley

I don't even remember....I just grabbed a big stack of
shims, from all the pulleys I was messing around with,
and stuck them on there. Could be 10, could be 15 or
more! I did have to stick two more on, after my
initial attempt, to get enough slack on the belt. I
doubt I could fit many more, though...I've got no
shims on the outside, and the bolt has just enough
threads to get all the way through the nut, and stick
out a smidge.
