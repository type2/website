Subject: camper interiors question
Date: Fri, 4 May 2001 11:24:19 -0700

I have looked through the archives and cannot find the info I am looking for.  I see that westy interiors
are listed as SO34, SO42 and SO44.  I would like to know the difference between these and is one more
desirable than the other?

Thanks in advance,
Kurt
