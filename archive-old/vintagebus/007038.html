&gt;&gt;Forgot to list one that Mr. ($10000.00) Heard  should have given out.

&gt; SOTO was for sale for $10K
&gt;
This may be a dumb question but how can he 'own' the club?  I don't think I
understand the nature of car clubs.

On a side note, here's a story:
They sent me a note asking for a link to their web site, which happens to
end in _dot_org  It was my understanding that _dot_org was for non-profit entities
so I asked if SOTO was a non-profit club.  No response yet...  :)

Later,
