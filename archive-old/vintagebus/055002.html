Hi Gary,
We heard simular situation from a good local engine rebuilder that his 
experience was that the paper gaskets did not stay under the cylnders over 
the lifetime of the engine rebuilds he did.  So he only used high temp 
silicon sealant under the cylinders.  Probably due to our babying our engines 
by not flooring and ignoring the engine oil temp and even before we went to 
CW crank when we found it neccesary to retorque the heads at 40,000-50,000 
miles these paper gaskets not only stayed but sealed for the 80,000+ miles 
engine lifespans we had.  So what Gene Berg said is probably true if you are 
more high HP and thus extreme high engine temp orientated VW owner.

  From what we understand Gene Berg also said that installing a CW crank into 
a stocker engine was a waste of time/$.  The CW crank probably is not much of 
an improvment for higher RPM and HP in the stocker engine, but we have found 
it improves the smoothness, quiteness, and definitely extends the lifespan of 
the engine because it is not shaking/vibrating itself apart all the time as a 
stocker engine does.
