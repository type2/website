Hi Rex,

    Actually either will bolt up. The difference is going to be the rest of
the tin, air filter, breast plate, pre-heat piping, etc. &quot;B&quot; goes with the
older air filter with the small &quot;Pre-heat hose&quot;, some where around 1967 and
earlier. &quot;A&quot; goes with the air filter that uses the larger &quot;Pre-heat hose&quot;
(same size as the fresh air heater hoses 1963 up) 1968 and up. The breast
plate (rear sheet metal, crankshaft pully end) will have holes to match.
    If you can lay all of your tin out with numbers, get pictures and we'll
see if we can ID it all.
