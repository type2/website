I like the idea of what you are trying to do. One thing you might consider is a name change. Since this is in the early stages it would be easy. It is not that I dislike the name but there is all ready a hardcore bus club in Idaho that has the name the Bus Pilots Association. It could be confusing. These are a really cool and active group it would be a shame to step on their toes by confusing their name. I guess another option would be to ask them. They might not mind. I do not have any direct contact. But they have a website you can find by doing a search for Bus Pilots. 


A listing of members with trailers and tow rigs would be quite helpful.


Hope any of this helps,

Craig

the Gorge VW club
