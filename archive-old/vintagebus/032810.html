&lt;&lt; This probably isn't very good advice. It's true that the aluminum expands

Hi Aaron,
When heating a metal piece with a hole in it the hole gets bigger in 
diameter.  The fact that the aluminum swells faster than steel hopefully will 
leave the spark plug smaller.  
  Being a machinist I we have experience in locking together machined taper 
fit parts.  You heat the part with the hole in it, and chill the part that 
goes into it.  That way one part shrinks a bit and the other expands.  The 
result is better than just pressing them together!  
  This is the same reason VW pistons and cylinders are machined sooo loose 
when cold compared to steel pistons in a cast iron cylinders.  The aluminum 
swells quicker than the cast iron cylinders so if the pistons were machined 
for tighter tolerances of the steel in cast iron they would sieze in thier 
cylinders.  Which is a big reason why VW AC engines are so noisy when first 
started!
