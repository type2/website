Kelly, Al and everyone,

The issue here is not whether or not someone has a job, the issue is whether
or not the person in question has morals and principles. Obviously the man
who tried to rip off Uncle Jerry's emblem has no moral objection to taking
another person's possessions. My guess is that this guy would have tried the
same stunt on UJ even if he had a thousand dollars in his pocket. He just
wanted to take something that he took a fancy to and it didn't matter that
it belonged to someone else.
A person like this will steal if he has a job or not, whether he &quot;needs&quot; the
item in question or not, whether he likes the person from whom he is
stealing or not. It's a character issue every time, not a question of need
or money. I operate a Christmas Tree lot every year, and every year we have
trees stolen. Imagine celebrating the holidays with a stolen tree....I can't
but a lot of people would do it.
just my $0.02.
John
