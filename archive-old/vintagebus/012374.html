I have received information on all of my busses. Not a lot of information mind you, but they are neat certificates anyway. I e-mailed in a form and within a month or so had a nice certificate that listed the model number, engine number, color, production date, delivery date and where it was delivered to. So hang in there they seem to be quite good about this. Or at least they have been with me. I have heard if you use regular mail there is a fee but by e-mail it is free.

I will see if I can find the site again. It may even be in the archives of the list.

Hang in there,
