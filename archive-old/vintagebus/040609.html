I did this just to conform to law.  What I did was place a 1/4 inch thick by
1 inch wide piece of medal behind the entire width of the cross member, then
drill holes through cross member and plate then mounted the seat belts.  I
too was concerned about a head on collision causing my sons head to hit the
divider in front of him but I decided that his bouncing around the
compartment would be worse.

Subject: [VB] Double cab rear seat belts


I'e been thinking about this  for years, and may
actually do something about putting rear seat belts in
my 65 double cab in the near future.
Has anyone done this, and if so, what is the best
method to use?  I did some looking in the archives but
found nothing useful.

Any suggestions would be appreciated. I  want to make
as little change to the truck as possible.
