Subject: engine troubleshooting help needed

Here's a little troubleshooting problem for those engine experts out there.

Problem:
Engine idles perfect, but during acceleration the engine starts to mis-fire
right around 1800rpm and above.

Background of the engine:
1600dp, 009, 34Pict-3, 1000 miles since rebuild, 85-90psi compression in all
four cylinders, stock cam, 040 heads, German stock exhaust, etc...

What I have done:
I have checked the valves, ignition is timed correctly for full advance,
points checked and changed, gap in plugs checked, carb pulled apart and
cleaned thoroughly, coil checked and changed for testing, dizzy changed to a
diff dizzy (problem continues), drained gas tank and changed screen in tank,
changed fuel filter, fuel lines, new fuel pump, changed pump rod.
Engine put on a dwell/rpm/volt gauge to correctly measure everything. And no
change.....


Any engine guru's out there ran into this problem and found a way to solve it.
The engine ran perfect the first 1000 miles. It sat all winter in the garage
and now  is having problems running correctly.

Possibilities:
Stuck valve, intake leak, bad carb (is a low mileage newer one), ???? Seems to
be running rich upon acceleration. Could be the problem. Not making any
abnormal noises at idle.

Any help would be appreciated as the bus is getting ready for the Classic
trip.

Thanks,
Dave Barnes
