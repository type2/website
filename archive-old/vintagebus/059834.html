Subject: Re: [VB] BASF paint codes 

Jdd,

You may be talking about Glasurit paint which is a division of BASF.
Glasurit was the OEM supplier for VW when they were making our cars.

Look in your yellow pages for auto body paint supply houses and see if there
are any listings for Glaurit or RM brand (same company). If you don't find a
listing, just call any supplier and ask then where you can buy Glasurit.

Once you locate a Glasurit supplier, they can give you a paint code but, the
code will only be usable if you buy Glasurit paint (very expensive!). Each
paint line has their own specific codes for paint formulations.

What are you trying to accomplish?
