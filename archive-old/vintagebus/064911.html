Subject: Re: [VB] Oil pressure dropped

&gt; My 1600 single port H cased engine had the oil light come on steady. It
&gt; has an external cooler and spin on filter. The cooler is mounted near
&gt; one of the side vents such that it is elevated above the fan shroud.
&gt; When the oil level was at the bottom line of the dipstick (one quart
&gt; low), the oil pressure just shut down. I noticed it quickly and shut
&gt; the engine down. After adding a quart of oil, the pressure came back.
&gt; The question is: are the upright engines prone to shutting down the oil
&gt; pressure when the oil level is only one quart low? If not, what could
&gt; be the contributing factors? Could it be the external cooler or
&gt; something else? Would an add-on sump help?

You may be syphoning the oil in the cooler and filter back to the sump,
which would make the level artificially high.  If your oil level magically
gains a quart between a reading just after shutdown and a reading an hour
or two later this might be it.

I'd fix this problem before applying band-aids like the deep sump.
