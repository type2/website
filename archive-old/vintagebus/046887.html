&lt;&lt; anyway, i may have a lead on a 63 for a spare, but cant recall the exact 
differences in a 63 transaxle as compared to 62 and older...
  i/e i know the drum and stub axle are different, i seem to recall a bit 
longer on the axle and snout, but by how much? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
The 1962, and 1963 standard bus trannies are the same.  It sounds like you 
are reffering to the special one year only 1963 one ton tranny (M-215).
