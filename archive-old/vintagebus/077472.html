Subject: Re: [VB] Blocked heat riser?

and try installing a pre heat tube to the air cleaner.   Without this the carb's throat and the sprout of the manifold will ice up even when the horizonatl bit of the manifold is clear.  Having the metal pick up tube as well is nice, but you can run the paper tube with out it.  just bend the paper tube so the lower end rests between the cylinders and the J tin under the cylinders

oh, with the clutch cable you may want to spin the drill backwards.
