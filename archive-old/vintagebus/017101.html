My theory is that the leverage of the ebrake system causes that shoe to
hit the drum first.  Under light braking, it's possible that only that shoe
hits.

You could also adjust the brakes and back that shoe off a tad, to even
it out, but there would be no way to validate your adjustment.

Rotating the shoes might work if you have drums in good health.  It's
definitely the way to get max life out of them.
