I checked out the site, it's kinda cool, the bus has the company logo on the 
front.  It looks like a 59-61 kombi- ventilation overhang, bullet turn 
signals, sturdy front bumper w/overriders

 I happened to come across this company's web page that features what
 looks like to be a very early split window bus.  Has the bullet front
 end and looks like it might not have the front lip for the fresh air
 vents above the windshields.  If you look in the background, you can
 tell that it;s a bus and not a truck, due to the number of windows
 visible.
 
 Is Mr. Barton a listee??
