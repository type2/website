&lt;&lt; why do you folks bolt the side step on? theft? &gt;&gt;

My bus with the side step is a camper, and already had holes in the 
jackpoints for the small side tent, and my step came w/o the original 
hardware, so I just drilled a hole and put in bolts.  Could have used a pin, 
but bolts are easier to come up with.

talking about the hole in the jack points for the small side tent, my westy 
has them too.   I only bring this up because it is kind of peculiar in that 
it has many physical signs of being a westy, such as white paint in the 
inside back on a combi type 23,  4 tent mounts on roof, came to me with the 
westy kit in it includng roof and roof wood bracing and the piece attached 
for the cooler unit to clip to,  white dash knobs, wheel and column, the 
extra place for the z bed side screw on the passenger side etc.   It is 
highly unlikey that anyone who wanted a regular combi to be a camper would go 
to the trouble of these details, I think so at least.  However, there is no 
actual  westy M code on m code tag.   

 Then again it didn't have the m code for the safaris, which were original, 
with adjustable plate and all. 

   Anyone else have m codes on their bus that dont show up on the tag?
