Volks,

This is to let you know that in the background there have been a batch of
changes recently in the non-structure that is type2_dot_com. Of the greatest
importance to me, personally, is that I have been slowly dis-entangling
myself from the adminstrative non-structure.  That dis-entanglement is now
complete. I am no longer one of the adminstrators of the type2 list.  I am
down to just another subscriber, which is exactly where I want to be :-)
Sean Bartnik, George Lyle, and David Schwarze are the admins now (with a
new fourth shift admin in training), as they have been for the last year
or two. They are doing a heck of a good job, and I feel confident in
leaving it in their hands.

Since I am not exactly going away, just steping out of the hot seat, I
don't want to get too valedictory, but I do want to thank you all for your
help and participation thru the years. Especially Gerry Skerbitz and Ken
Hooper, my predecessors; Sean, George, and David, my succesors; and David
Raistrick, who just sits silently in the background and makes things
work[1].  My thanks to those who run the other services on the site, Thom
Fitzpatrick of Vintagebus fame, Wade and Charlie Ford for AIRS. Also my
thanks (in no particular order :) to Nikki Elko, Charlie Ford, John
Anderson, Al Brase, Doctor Tim, Doc Ric, Karl von Salzen, Andy Pechenik,
and... (if I kept this up, I'd get thru the whole damn subscriber list :-)
the whole damn subscriber list! My thanks to all of you for all you have
done.

Two other points are also changing.  The list machine and its connection
to the net.  Right now, we are running, as we have been for 3-4 years, on
a machine that Denis Joliffe donated.  It is a good machine, but aged.  
In addition, the ISP we were using has also gone to a rack mount system,
and our machine is in a desk-top case.  Right at the moment David
Raistrick, our systems administrator, has arranged for a connection out of
a home DSL in Georgia (David, whose connection??? they ought to get
kudo's!), but that is a temporary expedient.  Home DSL is just too slow
for the amount of bandwith the list and site eat every month.

What was proposed at a meeting of the administrators a couple days ago is
that we get a new 2U rackmount machine and move that machine back to the
ISP in Seattle where we used to be located.  This will, alas, require more
money and more structure than we have at present.

On the money front, the colocation in Seattle will run $150 per month. The
machine to put in the rack will probably run $1,000-$2,000, depending on
what we buy.  The proposal of how to deal with these incipient expenses is
to hold a fund raiser.  Over the next couple weeks, a call will be made to
the members of the list (that's *you* :-) to donate money for both the
machine and the colocation fee.  The box will (I hope) be a non-recurring
expense, but the colocation fee is going to go on forever :-)  The exact
process has not been decided, so hold on a bit, but there will be a post
announcing this fundraiser within the next week or two.

Which bring me to point number two. 'Til now, the list non-structure has
been a loose group headed by Ken Hooper running the web portion, Thom
Fitzpatrick running the vintagebus list, and me running the type2 list,
with others running their bits.  Lots of other people have done &quot;stuff&quot;
over time, but there was never really a &quot;structure&quot; to it.  We have
received donations thru the years that allowed the list to keep going
without finances being an issue.  I did request donations back a couple
years ago, right after I began my tenure and I was literally overwhelmed
by the response!  I decided not to repeat the experience because the
response *was* so ovewhelming, actually.  I am not good at organization.
Any organization more complicated than a bridge game are very much beyond
me :-)  Fortunately, I won't have to now :-)  Ted Finesman has volunteered
to be Treasurer of our incipient organization.  Whatever is collected will
go to David.  As the guy who will run the machine, he should be the one
who buys it.  Beyond that, it's up to Sean, George, David, Ken, Thom and
whatever structure they devise :-)

We now return you to your regularly scheduled VW discussion... :-) 
And once again, thank you all!

[1] If you need, or know someone who needs a UNIX systems administrator or
network engineer and you have *not* contacted David (keen_at_type2_dot_com), then
you are making a big mistake!  He is the best, truly the best!  Head hunt
this guy!  Really!!!
