Tonight I slaved away in the garage and managed to install the oil pump and
GBE relief cover.  I hit some snags with setting the endplay.  Initially, I
had the endplay dialed in at .0035&quot; but after installing the oil seal and
retorquing the flywheel, I would loose my spec. and the flywheel assembly
would become hard to spin.  The guru is going to get this job - I give up on
it.

As for the dizzy gear - further inspection revealed that I was indeed one
tooth off  due to the blantant misinformation in the VW engine rebuilder
book.  I'm going to make my own notes in the margin for sure.  I was able to
get the gear out and rotate it one notch.  This required being adept with a
phillips screw driver, long nose punch, and holding a flashlight in my
mouth.  Now when #1 is at TDC, the dizzy is pointed right at the notch.
Good deal!

That's it for tonight's update...
