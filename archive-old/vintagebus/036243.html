&lt;&lt; i have a 69 + 59 kombi. i want to put the irs trans. into the 59 because 
the
 59 trans. has some problems. &gt;&gt;

Hi Adam,
It has been done, but you would have to fabricate/machine alot of parts to 
make it work properly!  Which would be alot more $ spent in just getting the 
conversion parts done than to just have a bus tunnel case 1960-67 tranny 
rebuilt!   Eric&amp;Barb
