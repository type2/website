&gt; May all your dreams be vintage and gifts be N.O.S.

Hey! For Friday Topic, does anyone want to share what kind of kewl bus
stuff they got? This is my first Bus Christmas, so I may be a little
more excited about this than you &quot;oldtimers!&quot;  :-)
This is a good chance for me to advertise for Dr. Joe and his KEWL BUS
RACKS since I got one of those! Like Uncle Jerry says, they're really
nice repros especially for the price. Hubby's putting it together
RIGHT NOW!!! :-) I couldn't be happier!
Also, got some kewl NOS mudflaps from RMMW and a new roundel (just
until I can find a &quot;real&quot; one---I know, it'll rust here in FL.)
How's about a Bentley Manual??? Got that too! My DAD bought me that!
:-)
Don't think my family's ever had such a good time shopping for me! I
didn't require ONE trip to the dreaded MALL! :-)
So, now she's ready for all those cutesy coolers up on the rack, and
I'm even MORE excited to drive my bus than before, if that's possible!
Isn't this good cheer what Christmas is all about?
Hope EVERYONE has a GREAT one! Busses included! Tell them Magic says
Merry Christmas too!
Enough silliness for one post!
Bye!
