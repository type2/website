I currently have a dead Diehard battery and was looking to have it
replaced. My question is should I take the one they recommend or will
any 12 volt battery do just fine? This is for my '62 which is a 12 volt
convert. 

I would like to stay with the Sears brands so I can use whats left of my
warrenty for the replacement.

I am just being a cheap bastard or do I really need the one they
recommend?
