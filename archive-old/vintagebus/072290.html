&lt;&lt; Ok, Its friday, I am new to the list so.. please keep me at bay if I am 
annoying
 but..  I am wondering what speed people like to drive buses on the 
 interstates.
  &gt;&gt;
I like to keep the 61 at ~58 mph.   This is with a 1600 sp.   Has 4.38 r/p 
and 1.26 rgbs, 15&quot; stock rims with 205 75 R15 tires on it.   Kick booty early 64 
gearing, where 58mph by the speedo (oh, that 62 by the road) is 3K rpms (even 
though the math evidently doesn't work out)  It can go faster (can cruise at 
70), but seems happiest at ~58.  You might think on long trip I'd speed it up, 
but if I am driving all day I'd rather enjoy the bus sounding happiest, and 
if I dont watch the speedo that where it ends up.   It has the motor I got in 
my 65 in it, that I put rebuildt heads on about a year after I got the westy, 
about 5 years ago now.  

I drive the 65 westy about 60 as well.  it has the 3.88 r/p, 1.26 rgbs, and 
195 75 R14 LT tires with a 1600dp mystery motor with header to clear the bolt 
on oil filterpump..  This is also 3K, and this set up has lots less oomph.  
I've been planning to build a 1679cc motor for the westy,  for about 3 years.

I drive the 53 standard cruising ~48 mph.  This is where the big red line is 
on the speedo. (split case tranny with 1.4 rgs, 36hp motor)   I haven't tached 
it out.  does a 12V tach work on 6V?

No, I don't mind if people pass me.  :)
