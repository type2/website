Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Rap on distributors

&gt; VW
&gt;engines WANT 42-45 degrees of full advance at part throttle, retarding to 32
&gt;total at 1/2 to full throttle.

i agree, and that's what my longtime vw friends tell me... but they run
009s coz they're cheap and they consider almost any dizzy you pick up at a
swap meet worn out beyond adequate performance.

i'm running a cast iron 019 only coz outta TEN dizzys i had on hand, it was
the only one to hold a stable curve and not 'chatter' at speed.

one of my long-term projects is rebuilding some dizzys, but once the vac
can is gone, fergit it... i have been finding 'nla' for many of the early
ones. anyone open one and re-diapghram one? didn't we have a debate not too
long ago about how far is TOOOO far in the rebuild world :)
