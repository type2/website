Subject: Re: [VB] Â difference 36 nut rear brakes vs 36 Big brake option vs 64 and up ?????

Hi, if your bus has the same shoes as the 64-67s but the 36mm nuts then you have the optional 63 package.  
That has the same gearing (1.26) as the big nuts
Could have been transplanted from another bus, who knows? it's almost 40 years old.  

The main differences- 
*unique drums- if yours get thrashed they are hard to find- (early drums do fit the 63 option stub axles, with the early shoes, and a couple thick washers between the drum and the axle nut) 
*unique stub axle.
*uses the same RGBearings as the earlier buses- cheaper and easier to replace that the big nut bearings.

FWIW the 63 truck I recently got has a early axle nut cover on one front, and the later on the other side.  WTF?What has someone done to it?   I wonder if it has the option RGBoxes, as the front imply the option spindles.  I'll find out later...

so make sure BOTH the back have the same style RGBoxes

Hi I'm looking at my 1963 rear brakes 36 mm nuts, they look just like '64
brakes with the 46 mm nut any other differences I can look for? I was going
to put the '64 trans/ reduction boxes in but IF I already have the big
brakes I'll just have this one rebuilt. I like the gearing it has now . It
came with a 1500 but there was no M code for the big brake option only seat
belt mounting. Lloyd in Eureka, Calif
