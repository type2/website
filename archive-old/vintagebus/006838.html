When I was involved in the Porsche 356 world there were 2 concourse classes
at the shows

1.  full concours, this was the trailer queen, no dirt, blades of grass,
wipe the inside of your wheel wells with white gloves, points off for
anything that was foreign to the car, etc.  etc..

2. street concours. this class was for perfect or near perfect cars that are
driving even though there were a lot of trailer queens entered in this class
being they couldn't win or place in the full concurs. This was the class
that the cars I restored were entered in (and we won a lot), in this class
you got a little slack, if the stitching in your seats wasn't perfect you
wouldn't lose points, the use of repop parts didn't deduct points either,
heck we even got away with powder painted parts, a no no in full concours,
grass in the tires, no big deal. Since being involved in the bus world I
have found that a lot of the bus crowd are a lot more anal about NOS parts
then the Porsche crowd ever was, a good repop was just as good as OG if you
needed it and it seems that the quality of the Porsche repop was a lot
better then the VW stuff. Of course one of the reasons for this was that
Porsche stepped in and started a vintage parts program in which all repop
parts that were up to Porsche standards would get Porsche stamp of approval
and even a vintage part number. Porsche AG bought out Stoddard Imports to
funnel this program through.

I have heard  rumors that VW is in the process of creating a similar
program, this would be awesome, it would insure the quality and fit of a lot
of repo parts and hopefully weed out a lot of the crap out there.

It would be nice to see some quality judging on our buses being full
concours (not my thing) or street concours much more dueable for the average
person with a little patience and perseverance and if that ever did come
about I feel a lot more of our buses would be restored to a better quality
and be shown, as long as you DRIVE it.

Step up to the plate Doug, start the class, find the judges and maybe at the
next Classic, OCTO, Barf-a-Rama we can see some real judging. I feel it's
long overdue in the VW world.

ronnie  just another one of my opinions,  I'm a beat up commercial bus guy
myself.

This is one of my favorite threads!

You're correct - *nobody* out there is restoring buses to concours
standards.  Some guys are doing a damn nice job, like the stuff
I've seen Lenny Copp put out, but if you'd ever been to a Porsche
concours (the only type I've ever been to) you'd see we're on a 
totally different planet.  Some of these guys spent more for wax
than we've spent for our cars.

Like I've said before, the bus owner demographic isn't particularly
suited to concours-type events.  Most bus bus people are poor, or
at least poor compared to the 7 and 8 figure income crowd that's into
the concours thing.  Another contributing factor is the &quot;tradition&quot; of
VW buses is not conducive to hermetically sealed restoration.  Too
many people want to drive their cars, and as such are hesitant
to dump scads of cash into them to make them into trailer queens.
Yes, there's a lot of trailer queens out there, but not as many 
percentage-wise as compared to the early porsches!

Can you imagine a Pebble Beach bus concours?  All these super-clean
detailed buses, with their scruff, scraggly, (and sometimes smelly)
owners milling about?

Well, it's not going to happen any time soon.  The market isn't there
yet for super nice, super-correct restos. Sure, there will be onesey
twosey jobs here and there, but they're the exception rather than the
norm.

I wish I had the attention to detail, and patience, to do a *real*
restoration.  Every time I do something on the '60, I find another
spot on the car where I think &quot;I really could have done that
better&quot; or &quot;Wow!  I can't believe I missed that!&quot;  Oh well.  I can
drive it, and it looks pretty from a distance, and women
aren't afraid to sit in it..  An OK compromise by me.
