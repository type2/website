Subject: found:58 westy UPDATE!!
Priority: normal
X-mailer: Pegasus Mail for Win32 (v3.01d)

well I finally was able to check out(and buy!) the 58 westy ,here's 
the lowdown!

VERY rusty! but savable. the interior is very nice and complete 
down to the coat hooks and curtain rods,the wood still has a 
glossy shine to it the roof hatch is complete and in good condition
taillights are there but cracked,decklid(58 only) is very straight but 
has hinge breakage.incorect later bumpers.I wrote previously that 
there was no title,but it was just lost!! and since I got it from the 
registered legal owner there will be no problem in getting it,he is 
going to send me a notorized release of interest.the funny thing 
about this bus is that the top and upper sides of the body is still 
shinny paint.but the rockers and basically all around the bus is 
rusted badly..might be from living on vashon island(salt water) for 
the past 20 or so years.

some of you wrote about the possibility of parting this bus out..I've 
decided to sell it whole only because it is too original and savable.
sorry..

anyone interested?the bus will be at my home in port orchard,wa in 
a few weeks!
