Thanks, Jack;

I've been trying to find Tom's phone number to post to the List, along
with a comment on his craftmanship and pricing.  Your filing system is
obviously more efficient than mine.

A year or so ago I wrote to the Type 2 List about my visit with Tom at
the Octobugfest in Puyallup, WA.  I had scanned in a copy of his
brochure/flyer, and several Listees got copies via personal E-mail.

I talked to Tom again this Spring at Puyallup, and at that time he still
didn't have Internet access or E-mail so the phone is the only way to
reach him.

His beautifully made racks were selling like hotcakes at Puyallup.  His
Allen-head hold-down clamps are especially nice.  He does build to order,
so you can have just about any design or size imaginable.

&gt;&gt; There is also a guy named Tom Connor who is making REALLY nice racks
to order and some standard versions for bus and bug. He is in Deer Park,
Washington, and can be reached at 509-276-7729.  &lt;&lt;
