Subject: wanted--recommendation for machine shop in Washington, DC USA
  area

I was replacing the muffler on my 1970 Westfalia (dp1600), and an exhaust stud on the cylinder head snapped (appx. 1/4&quot; of stud remains).  When my initial attempts to remove it w/ Kroil, a propane torch, and two nuts failed, I pulled the cylinder head.
Now I need somplace to take it for stud removal--preferably someplace that understands VWs.
Any recommendations appreciated.

I live in Silver Spring, MD--so closer to home is better.

How much should I expect to pay?

Bonus question:  what are the most effective gaskets to use b/t the cylinder head and the exhaust?  When I removed mine, it looked like there was some leakage on the Heater Box side.  I plan to replace the Heater Boxes, but would like to choose the best gaskets.

Thanks,
