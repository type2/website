Subject: deluxe bumper trim install help
To: type2 &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Are there any tip's out there for installing the
rubber trim in the aluminum on the bumpers.  I have
tried prying it and using WD-40 to lub it.  any
methods to this that anyone can share?

I have not had any luck yet.  

How did you soften up the rubber?  
Where to pry?
What end to start on?
How long should i expect to take to do them?

Thanks
Matt
