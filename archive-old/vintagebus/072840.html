Subject: Double Cab Sighting

Watch Charlie's Angels at least the begining.  When
Demi Moore is driving away from the beach in the
ferrari.  You will see a lowered double cab white on
top and a dark color like green on bottom with chrome
rims.  I think its lowered and I couldn't see the
bumpers.  It was so fast of a frame I couldn't see
much detail of it so someone has to get that shot on
the net.  So the next scene is a 21 window deluxe. 
Nice although it is extending the stereotype of the
surfer bus.  Hollywood has a fixation with that one. 
The whole sheryl crow video and others.  Enjoy your weekend.
