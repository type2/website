Hi folks,

After seeing the posts last week about the first issue being the last, :-( I
went back to Barnes &amp; Noble &amp; snagged their last 3 copies. Someone had asked
for extra copies 'cuz his bus was in the mag but he'd not found any copies
in his area, but I deleted the post. You know who you are: pmail me with
your address, and I'll get one (or 2 or 3, if you want 'em all) into the
mail. First come, first serve, etc., ...
