Subject: fooled by Berg/Type IV cooler

I don't believe the type IV cooler was ever available as a kit. Eric and
Barb and Hot VW's have both shed a lot of light on this conversion.
Never thought I would use those two in the same sentence. The conversion
is fairly easy to accomplish. I built one for my new 1776 for the 60
Double Cab. You need to cut off the back of the &quot;doghouse&quot; part that
houses the oil cooler and weld in a 1&quot; wide piece of metal. This allows
for the extra width of the cooler. You could probably rivet in the piece
if you do not weld. Berg is making a complete all ready extended piece
that you just rivet to the back of your fan shroud. I then modified the
vent tin out the back to match the extended piece very closely. The
cooler bolts right on with longer studs in place. It took me about a day
including painting and get bits and pieces. I could probably do my
second one in about 2 hrs. I have not run it yet as I am still waiting
for the motor to get back.
Good luck,
Craig
