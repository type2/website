it which pulled out, boo, hoo.
 Hi Rene,
Sorry to hear that!

&lt;&lt;Would an insert work here, what size or number would that be?&gt;&gt;
Depends on what was in there to begin with!
 
&lt;&lt;What about that cold aluminum welding stuff?&gt;&gt;
Junk!
 
&lt;&lt;Right now i cannot pull the stud thru the barrel with the saver on it.  
Should i take off, vise-grips, etc.? I could cut it and get a new stud. &gt;&gt;
Remove the cylinder and piston nearest the stripped head stud hole, if the 
stud is inbetween the cylinders you will have to remove both #3 and #4 Ps&amp;Cs. 
 Take the head stud with it's case saver on it to your VW FLAPS and have them 
take a look at it so they can tell you if they have a bigger size or the DPO 
already went too big of case saver to replace properly.  If you get a bigger 
case saver, drill and tap the hole bigger and use a little engine sealant in 
the threads to seal them up.  Make sure to only use HSS (High Speed Steel) 
drill and tap with a little oil.  Yes they are a bit more expensive, but in 
the long run better tools are worth it!   Eric&amp;Barb
