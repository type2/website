Subject: Re: [VB] Mudflaps on Ebay

I bought a set of those &quot;Rubber Tire Mud Flaps&quot; from RMMW.  Luckily I got my
set for $35 before the hiked the price up.  They are not near as nice as
some of the older repop sets that I've gotten, but hey, when RMMW can't sell
them unless they are NOS parts what do you want them to do???  I think for
$50 I would have gotten ripped, but at $35 I like my set.  I think I'm going
to hang them on the wall until I get a stock bus.  Currently mine is low
enough that I'd have to fab a set of mounting brackets to keep them from
rubbing the road.
