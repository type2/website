Subject: Re: [VB] Adjusting a H30/31 pict carb

This heating problem is still with us when the outside temp. is above
85. We are running a 6 volt small generator pulley to help turn the fan
about 2.1 to 1 (stock is 1.6 to 1). This helps in cooling it down faster
(as required), when you idle and we do get better heating when we use
the heater.
We also have type 4 dog house cooler.
Maybe it is an ez camper problem (LOL) who knows?
We do run 47 to 53 mph to help kept temp down.
This summer we did not have a temp problem running around the north west
USA
Ours carb. is a new 'Brog'  pic 30 type we did increase our mileage with
this new carb but have not played with the jetting yet, so please share
if you find anything.
PS Rhone thinks we are wasting HP by turning the fan faster and we are
sure it does some.
