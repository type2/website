Rolling back odometers.
Selling salvaged vehicles as &quot;good, used&quot; ones.
Forging Social Security numbers and signatures.
Falsifying auto loan applications and sales contracts.

Those are some of the allegations against the Joe
Florek Volkswagen and Audi dealership contained in an
affidavit filed by the FBI to obtain search warrants
that were served in October on the Flagstaff business
and other locations associated with it.


The 59-page affidavit was unsealed by a judge this
week, and it describes in detail a six-month
investigation into alleged bank fraud, mail and wire
fraud, and odometer fraud.


The affidavit was prepared by Marilyn Shefveland, a
special agent with the FBI assigned to the Bank Fraud
Task Force in Phoenix, which has been investigating
the Florek dealership since March 2000.

No arrests have been made regarding the violations
outlined in the affidavit.


Marc Dallacroce, a special agent with the FBI, said
the investigation is continuing. He was unable to
comment on the status of the investigation and if any
arrests were imminent.

The FBI has had help of the Flagstaff Police
Department, the Coconino County Sheriff's Office and
the Metro anti-drug task force, the Arizona Attorney
General's Office, the Arizona Department of
Transportation, the Arizona Motor Vehicle Division and
the State Department of Liquor Licenses andControl.



The affidavit, an explanation of why there was
probable cause to justify the search warrants, was
unsealed by U.S. Magistrate Judge Morton Sitver on
Monday.

Another search warrant was served on a second
dealership, Gray Mountain Auto Connection near Cameron
on North Highway 89, also owned by co-owners 
Jay Wigdore, 42, and Steve Fiorentino, 46, of the
Florek dealership.

A third was served on Fender Bender, an auto body
repair shop on East Huntington Drive that the
dealership operates for servicing its own vehicles and
its customers' vehicles.

A fourth was served on a storage shed at Coconino Mini
Storage rented by the business.

According to the affidavit, the probe was launched in
part after the Flagstaff Police Department reported
receiving more than 40 complaints regarding business
practices at the Florek dealership and the Gray 
Mountain dealership.

project investigator
