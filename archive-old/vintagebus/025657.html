Hi Everybody,

With the Vintage meet less than two weeks away, we are wondering if any
type2 or vintagebus members will be passing through and need a place to
tie up for a day or two. We can offer a medium sized lawn, electricity
and hot showers. May have to gang up the busses, but could park several.

We will be attending the Burgermaster Meet on Friday night and the
Vintage on Saturday, but always avoid the drags on Sunday. We are
seriously thinking of hosting a very casual BBQ on Sunday, relaxing and
bus b's-ing. We would like to get a feeling of how many might be
interested before making food arrangements (probably hot dogs and maybe
burgers). Kids more than welcome. Sure would be a great way to end a
Volkswagen Weekend. We are in West Seattle, South of downtown and about
30 min from Shoreline College. Let us know...
