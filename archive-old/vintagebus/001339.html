Just depends on your situation. When I was in college living off student
loans and financial aid, taking a road trip for a couple months in the
summer was no big deal. Now that I'm working to pay off those student loans
(err...road trips), cruising around the countryside in my VW sounds like a
very far fetched dream.

And what a road trip that sounds like!! I'm jealous!

But then I read about your progress on your bus, and I think: how do you
afford that? I can't imagine having the time to fart around on a complete
bus teardown and rebuild :-)

&gt; Something I've always wondered: those of you who do these
&gt; road-trips-from-hell -
&gt; how do you afford that?  I can't imagine taking 6 months off to
&gt; go fart around the countryside.  Not having any recently deceased rich
&gt; relatives, if I don't work, I don't eat, and my buses don't eat.
