Hey Volks!

I'm just about to go get my tyres removed from my rims in preparation for
powder coating along with my bumpers.  Then I re-assemble the front door
window frames which I painted yesterday.  I used the PPG DP40 primer that
came with my doublecab, and went out and got me some PPG Pearl White (#8237)
and applied it.  The match to L87 is better than the Nason that I had
sprayed the upper part of the bus with...it's a bit creamier...but it should
be OK, I hope!  Maybe later, I'll sand down the Nason and re-spray the rest
of the bus.  NEVER cut corners or go the cheap route with paint!  NEVER!  Oh
well.

I got my homemade birch kick panels in, the seats and pedestal
mats....installed the baywindow tank, and cleaned up the engine a bit.  I'm
just about ready to put the engine in!

My jalousie windows are sitting in a morass of Jasco....I'm stripping off
the failed POR-15 &quot;Glisten PC&quot; and after retouching the aluminum, I am
either going to re-apply it, or use some other kind of sealer....if anyone
has any suggestions as to what to use to seal the aluminum without high
build-up and excessive gloss, please let me know!

WANTED:  A right-hand side jalousie window assembly.  One of the tabs on
mine is broken off.....does anyone have a replacement part?

To do:  Install engine, get rims and bumpers powdercoated, new hubcap clips
on, reassemble bumpers and install, finish jalousie windows and install,
re-assemble front window frames and install, get a battery and install, put
some gas in the tank, test engine and electrical, disassemble and clean all
brakes, bleed brakes, get sand out of everywhere, repack bearings, general
grease grease grease, scrape the excess sealant out of the seals on all
stationary windows, and fill the bus with necessary camping stuff in
preparation for BYOB and Kelley Park!

All this in time?  Wish me luck!  And good luck to all ye who art struggling
to get your buses ready, as well!

Later,
Gene Cornelius
