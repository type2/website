I know it isn't Friday... but I have to comment on this one.

If you are really serious about getting a Bus and want list help, make it a
little easier on us.

1) Why do you only want a '69?
2) Where in the world are you located.  A state would be nice, a city even
better.
3) Do you expect perfect body / perfect engine or do you have a shell and an
engine and are only after two front doors?
4) Willing to travel?
5) Rust repair and welding are in your norm?
6) You really could come up with $1500 for a decent bus but you hope to get
a steal at $500.
