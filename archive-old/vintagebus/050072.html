&gt;A reminder:  If you must (say if you are in East Armpit, Nebraska and
&gt;need to get out of town fast) use 195/75R14 tires you _must_ buy load
&gt;range D tires.  Load range C in this size has less capacity than
&gt;185R14 _passenger_ tires!

I find the entire tire industry to be Kafkaesque so this may well be true.
Load rating spec for an early bay (splitty may be a bit less) is ~1500
pounds for comparison purposes. In 185 the Yokohamas are around 1600 in
load range C, 1850 in D (the D is an 8-ply). 185s are not nearly so easy to
get. I don't have specs for the 195s nor money for tires anyway but
whatever you get you want to be around or over 1500.

As always you are not going to pop tires like this no matter what you do to
them. Four of the 8-ply tires would give you far more capacity than you
could ever get out of second gear and if perchance you got weight like that
moving you could not stop it again with your puny brakes. 8) The important
thing is the sidewall and the 6-plies will keep you from being flung over
the center line by a crosswind and THAT is what you are after unless you
have a scrap-iron business or are a mason or something.

&gt;What French?  The last time I bought a set of XZX's for my D*tsun they
&gt;were made in (1) USA, (2) Canada, (3) Taiwan, and (4) Belgium.  Yep,
&gt;four tires, all the same make and model, made in four different
&gt;countries!

Uh-oh. How many blew up and destroyed your wheel wells? 8) Michelin is
France's second biggest employer after La Cie.   &lt;-- Mac joke, leave me
alone!

They go faster if you mount them with the white letters showing,
