&gt; a) oil pressure relief valve spring too  strong;
&gt; b) the &quot;heavy duty&quot; oil pump fitted by the engine builder is too  beefy for
&gt; the job; or
&gt; c) there is a blocked oilway or incorrectly fitted  bearing that is blocking
&gt; oil flow and causing back pressure into the  cooler.  &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; 

hey Guys and gals    First we need to know a little more  single or dual 
relief case?? I have seen where the springs were reversed and caused over 100psi 
pressure,  also make sure that there arent two relief valves in the same hole 
seen this happen also .  hook apresure gage to the engine and get a real 
reading . Also could be the wrong oil cooler seals blocking the passage.  Dont think 
it would be the pump or the case passages blocked. later and have fun  Mark
