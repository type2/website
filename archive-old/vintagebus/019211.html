Well today I worked on the Westy's somewhat thrashed electrical.  Now all of
the turn signals work (except for the one and it IS a hack job ;-)) and 
hazards, instrument lights, and the headlight relay clicks with the brights but
no headlights ever come on.  That's for tommorrow, along with the amazing 
three-wires-into-one right rear light.

I also got my locking steering column switch working.  The screwdriver operated
bay-bus switch screwed into the dash really bothered me, so I messed with my
nifty non-working one.  The electrical component is fine (so is the spare I got
from Dave Raistrick for two bucks, dude I owe you a beer or _something_) but
the tumbler was immobile.  Dump some graphite in there, bam, it works with the
rusty crusty original key!  Problem: I can't get it to stay in again!  The 
Bentley says to push the switch in while turning the key, and the spring will
click back into place.  I do this, but no clickie and no stay innie.  Anybody
with one of these (I think '67 only option, earlier non-removable?) got a 
suggestion for me?  Another swell as hell thing is that the locksmith is 
making me copies of my rusty key based on the code on the lock cylinder.  Now
all I need is a good '67 cargo door handle to have rekeyed, and I will have a
one key bus.  Anybody got a good handle for me?

I dumped some gas in the fuel tank to clean it out, pulled the bolt out of the
hose, nothin'.  Pulled the hose.  Nothin'.  She's clogged, so I pulled the tank
out.  I plan on cleaning it with the pressure washer this weekend.

I removed all sorts of PO type stuff from the bus today too.  Yards of taped
up wiring, an ignition coil bolted to the roof of the engine compartment, a 
couple lights, a vacuum gauge and associated 15' of hose, and an external oil 
cooler.  And some switches and their wiring.  And some other stuff.  It makes
the wiring look less hopeless, but there's still stuff not working and some
suspicious hanging wires that look disappointingly spliced-yet-stock.  And man,
the wiring in the engine compartment is simply just plain NASTY.

Remaining things I'm not sure about are how to test the oil and gen light 
circuits without an engine and being uncertain of what is what, given the 
condition in the engine compartment (ideas?), and how to get off those
fugly air scoops.  There's this really attrocious set of fiberglass scoops on
my Westy.  I'm not sure how they're on, they look riveted one second, then they
look bondoed, then they look 'glassed...maybe all three.  Ideas here would
be appreciated, keeping in mind I can't afford paint for probably a while.

More work to do on Friday!  After classes :-(
