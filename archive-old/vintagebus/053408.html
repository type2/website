&gt; oil changes.  As to the weight oil to use, Ronnie posted a link to an
&gt; excellent article about 2 weeks ago.  I printed out the article, but now I
&gt; don't have the link to give you.  It was on the web site for the Vintage
&gt; Triumph Register and was written by Ed Hackett. Find the article and read it.

A link that seems to have the latest version of the article is at:
