I'm curious - I've been looking at some the English VW import web sites over
the last few months and I have noticed they always seem to have a lot of
sliding and double door Buses (ignoring DD Panels).  Were these options more
common over there?
-  - -- - -
there were alot more commercial vehicles, as the us had that import tax 
against commercial vehicles 

compared to the euro/brits buses, the N AM buses are all pretty standard.  
Many many many more options there.   Probably was easier (cheaper?  quicker?) 
to get custom orders.  Saw a velvet green double slider panel (63?) and some 
one said he knew the guy who had ordered it- had wanted one, went to the 
dealership, and a bit later there is was.....
