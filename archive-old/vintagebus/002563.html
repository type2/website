Look, I've put up with all this talk about the torguemesiter pro &amp; con long
enough.  NO MORE PLEASE!!!!!!!  Oh I've seen all the TV ads telling you 
how good it works, yea right!  You have to use it not stick it in the closet
like most women do. The truth is most people see the models and think
'that could be me, I could look like that'. 
  What.......that's not what they were talking about?  Oh, I thought you 
meant &quot;The ThighMaster&quot;, eh.... never mind q:-)
