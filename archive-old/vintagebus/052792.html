Hiya list

Someone gave me an early Blaupunkt Radio today.  It can be either 6 volt =
or 12 volt I think because it has this tag on it that shows a switch in =
either a 6 or 12 position.  It is currently in the 6 position and I =
can't easily get it to move to 12.  It has both knobs and it is missing =
one button.  It has one button that has a music sign, another that says =
&quot;OFF&quot; and the third is missing.  Anyone know where I could find one of =
those buttons or what it said?  Am I  right that this is either 6 or 12 =
volt depending on the position of the thingy or is there something =
inside that has to be changed?  Is there anywhere I can look to find out =
a bit more about these? =20
