While I grieve at the thought of this haneous crime, I have to wonder if any 
of us would be talking about this if she hadn't been traveling in a VW bus. 
The point is - every day we live, we work and we die. Every single day the 
news reeks of tragedies like this throughout this land of the free. Sad but 
true the fact remains that there are no guarantees in life. Live every moment 
as it were your last. Live life to the fullest. Live life as you dream and 
seek answers on the road that you choose.

All peoples lives are affected by this story and I say let it run its course 
like all the others. If you really want to make a difference, support your 
local gun enforcement and three strikes laws. Too many felons are let loose 
in this country everyday. Do something about it. Stop grieving and starting 
fighting to make a difference.

This girl was excited about traveling the country and finding her life on 
another coast. She traveled a great life and all of us should feel proud that 
she choose a bus. A volkswagen! look at all of this from a heavenly viewpoint 
and not an earthly viewpoint. Be positive, happy and grateful to help each 
other out. Strangers meeting strangers everyday. Among thisVW family take 
care of each other, embrace each other and until we meet again take care of 
yourselves!  While I never met her your spirit will live on in all VW busses. 
Rest in peace Kristin Ann Laurite, may the four winds blow you safely home.
