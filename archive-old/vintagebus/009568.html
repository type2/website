&gt;I am finally getting ready to put a 1964 single cab back on the road after
&gt;sitting around18 years.  I was  wondering if anyone can give me advice if a
&gt;shoulder harness can be installed without  messing up the cab.  I would
prefer
&gt;the shoulder harness rather than just a seat belt.
&gt;


When it comes to shoulder harnesses in a split bus, the choices are two,
neither very attractive.
  1.) Attach to the B-pillar (the one behind the door), which requires
reinforcement of the pillar. The pillar will probably collapse forward even
if it is reinforced, since it is just sheet metal.
  2.) Use a four-point system and attach to the floor behind the seat. The
drawback here is that, with the attachment point lower than the shoulders, a
serious compressive injury of the spine will probably occur in the event of
a collision.

I think I'll just quit using my lap belt and hope to be thrown out.
