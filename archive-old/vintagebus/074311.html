Subject: RE: [VB] Rotating Bus tires

On radials, no matter what the car, I have always rotated front to
opposite corner rear and vise versa. I am not sure that is correct, it
was just the way I was taught back in the early 70's.

Question for the day, originally our buses came with bias ply tires and
the tire rotation was front to rear, keeping the lefts on the left and
rights on the right.  Nowadays, we mostly are running radials, so do we
do the radial tire rotation moving the rear to the front and the front
to the opposite rear?  Just a curious question to see what some of y'all
do.

Thanks
