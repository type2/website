Subject: Re: [VB] Names of our loved ones.

 When I got ready to paint her my first reaction was to give
&gt;her orginal color back, Dove Blue, (she was painted a dirty white when I got
&gt;her).  Well the paint went on and the energy died.  The color sucked and
&gt;everybody that look at her just shook their heads, puke.

What's wrong with Dove Blue?  It's so 50s-60s!  I don't consider a vehicle
to be _restored_ unless it's the same coler it was the day it left the
factory.  Just my own view I guess.

&gt;'93 MR2 Turbo (freeway flyer)


I have a '91 MR2 Turbo I'm about to sell.  I've driven it ONCE in 1.5
years!  Crazy to hold on to it if I don't drive it, and without it in my
garage I'll have the room (and the $$$) fo start on my Westy.  It's got
33,000 miles, red in color.  I'm going to install new rear tires (original
Bridgestone RE71s) and a new wiendshield before I sell it.  Anyone
interested?

[sorry for the off topic vehicle!]

P.S. My cars don't have names, but my cat does...
