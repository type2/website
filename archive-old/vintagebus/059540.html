Subject: Re: [VB] Grrr,  Westfakia!

I have seen many euro westfalia's retroactively retroffited with a NA =
issue  &quot;Hehr&quot; jalousie window. I believe that euro westy's came with =
standard VW pop outs as the jalousie windows were perceived as a safety =
hazard in Europe- so owners have take it upon themselves to substititue a =
jalousie window when they get their hands on it. Note as well on this bus =
it appears to have the european stlye mirror on the pass. side arms. Would =
be interesting to see what kind of tailights it has on it. Definately a =
mixed breed just hard to say if it started out life as a standard or a =
westy.

 The crank out windows were an additional cost over the popouts.

 I have heard that once in a rare while westys were made from standards, =

    The ONE jalousie window doesn't make sense.  Halfway swap over is what =

check out the M code tag.   remnants of glue around windows from headliner =

sides in back of bus?   Wiring for interior side lights new or old?
