A neighbor just walked in and handed me a new 1/65th scale bus toy, It's a
Speed Wheels bus 2 for a buck. This is the same bus as I have found in the
Road and Track 5 packs and looks like the same one in the Matchbox packs
also. It has the high roof pop top like the early matchbox buses of years
back, he said he found it in the toy section at Safeway supermarket, white
with blue tinted windows.
