Subject: RE:  seat belts for pre-67 buses
Date: Fri, 14 Aug 1998 14:26:55 -0500

&gt;Has anyone had experience installing seatbelts in a pre-67 
&gt;bus (driver quality, not for show)? Is this an unpardonable sin? 
&gt;Are there kits available or must seat belts be adapted from 
&gt;another vehicle? Thanks in advance for the help.

No, the unpardonable sin would be flying through your factory safaris
and leaving half of your flesh hanging on the frames because of NOT
having seatbelts!!  My 58 has a pair of lap belts installed in a
heavy-duty manor.  They have the Wolfsburg (sp?) crest on them so must
have com from some other VW.  Not nearly as good as shoulder belts, but
better than nothing.

I understand there are aftermarket, retractable shoulder belts that can
be installed in older buses, but in order to anchor them sufficiently,
you have to weld a big metal plate to the inside of the door pillar to
bolt the upper part to.  I plan to do this eventually since my single
cab is an every-dayer and I live in a big city with lots of crazies.
