&lt;&lt;  and all these people are as unique and diversive in their interests as 
everyone else I know (of). &gt;&gt;

Yeah, I have a friend who used to star in a series on TV who casually asked 
about buying a bus a while back.  If he'd kept up his interest, I would have 
been glad to help him get one.  What's the big deal?

We might love 'em, but they're still just vehicles, and you can do whatever 
you want to a vehicle if it's yours.

there seems to be an ethic that while an individual has actual title to 
something, it may have a value beyond that in which the owner is a sort of 
caretaker.  I dont think I am putting this well.   I read in the paper 
yesterday that this couple just bought a house in oregon, and wanted to tear 
it down and build another.  Turned out to be the only house Frank Llyod 
Wright designed and buildt in the state, and the architech the couple tried 
to hire  declined the job, which included building a 1.5 mill dollar house,  
refused to refer them to anyone,  and said no firm worth a dime would tear 
that house down.  various organisatins are trying to buy  the land from the 
couple, or just the house and move it elsewhere.  as, even though it is their 
property, that place is considered special enough that people are going to 
extra lengths to persuade this couple not to destroy their own personal 
property.     I think there is something of a similar feeling with old buses. 
  Of course, I have no reason to believe that EVH would  be destructive  to a 
bus anymore or less than anyone else.   Hey if he wants to buy a done bus to 
drive more power to him.   Didn't he always live in LA where there were 
millions of VWs everywhere in the 60s and 70s?
