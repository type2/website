Subject: re:Rare Bus

If you keep in mind that rare is a relative term, then sure that is a rare
bus. It is nowhere near as rare as a nice barndoor or maybe a cinema bus
but it is more rare than a 72 bus with a blown motor. The double doors are
one of my favorite busses. They are really user friendly. The fact that it
is a bay window will hurt it's collectability some, although even they seem
to be gaining some respect. I have seen probably 3 double door bay windows.
None were in particularly good shape. I think the prices ranged from
$1500-$3500.
Hope this helps,
