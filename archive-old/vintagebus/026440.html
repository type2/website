Sorry Rich, you drive a bus, so by definition you can't be &quot;normal.&quot; 8^)

&gt; This weekend I am tackling the rear brakes (never done brakes in my life
&gt; before I did the front last weekend).  I pulled, cleaned and put everything
&gt; back together (less the drums) yesterday.  Had to stop there last night;
&gt; something about my wife making me have a social life.

She sounds fairly normal, but there is the question of her choice of
husband.
 
&gt; This AM I went out and there were a couple of puddles at the point where the
&gt; tranny boot connects to the transaxle.  I noticed that the clamp was a
&gt; little (half turn or so) loose.  It never leaked before; I tightened it.

This is also normal. Since the wheels are off, the axles have been
hanging down in a different position from their normal position. Any
fluid that was on the boots or was normally held in by a clamp that was
a little loose might be able to get out and drip. It's also normal for a
boot that was about to die to go ahead and fail due to the abnormal
position of the axles. Check your boots. Maybe you'll be lucky and they
won't have any tears. In that case tightening the clamp probably fixed
the leak.
