Dave,

You're a lucky man to have a wife who is into buses like you are. My ex
hated my bus. I guess that's why she's now my ex... She didn't like
having to climb up into the seat, complained that the bus &quot;smelled
funny&quot;, complained about going too slow, missed the a/c in her T*y*ta,
was always afraid we'd break down...

Two heads are always better than one...

david

PS: Actually, one time we did break down, when the throttle cable broke
on my '71 Westy about 20 miles from home. There were some stiff wires
with orange flags on them around a new patch of landscaping near where
we broke down. She plucked one off the ground and fixed the broken
throttle cable... She had potential!
