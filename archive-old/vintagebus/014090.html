I used to have a cheapie brand welder; I got it slightly used from
someone I worked with.  I already had the Lincoln 100 at the time,
but I couldn't pass up at the price.  I should have.  This knock-off
was a visual copy of the Lincoln, but didn't work nearly as well.
You could weld with it, but the duty cycle was crappy, which left you
with inconsistent welds.  The wire-feeding mechanism sucked.

Cambell Hausfeld stuff is spotty.  Some stuff is marginally OK, but from my
experience it's the same taiwanese crap you get at harbor freight, only
with a very patriotic looking American flag logo to make you think
you're buying American stuff.  I have nothing against the Taiwanese, 
I'm sure they're very nice people, but the &quot;tools&quot; they send over
here are crap.  Ingersoll-Rand air tools aren't that much more, but
way better quality-wise. 

As anyone on this list that has done a lot of work on cars, or on
*anything*, can attest, good tools make the difference.  There is nothing
better than being able to concentrate on the work at hand, and your
craftsmanship, and not having to dick with a balky wire feed, crappy
fit, breaking pieces, etc.  It sucks to have to spend more time 
fixing the tools than fixing the bus.  I went thru my cheap-tool phase
years ago, and learned that in the long or short run, you're not
saving any real money by buying crap.

And yes, the retail welding stores are expensive.  But at least when
you go in there and ask about welding, you don't get some pimply-faced high
school freak with a pierced eyeball looking at you like a deer
in the headlights, &quot;Like, well, you weld stuff with it&quot;.  You can also
usually get them to flex on the price a bit, if you've done your homework
and can quote the Home Depot price.

Harbor Freight sells the Lincoln welders and attachments at a better
price than the chain hardware stores do.  If you don't think you
want to spend the money for a Lincoln, go look a Hobart or a Miller. :)
