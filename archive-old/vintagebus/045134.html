Subject: speedos and tires
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I swapped the front tires on my 61 - now there are 205 70 R 14s on the front, 
instead of 205 75/R15s, which are still on the back.   Think that makes the 
diameter 25&quot; instead of 26.5&quot;   forget exactly, but it did drop it 1 1/2 or 2 
inches.   Funny thing is that now I  go &quot;30mph&quot; in 2nd gear before I shift to 
3rd.  Wow.   So I still have no clue how accurate it is or was.   With the 
15s all around what Veewee111 read as 60 in their bus *was* more like 55 in 
mine.  Who has a GPS I can borrow?
