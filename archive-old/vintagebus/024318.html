Subject: RE:  Steering Wheel Kit

Jason,
Check out the Eastwood Co. Following URL displays the kit you're looking
for.
http://www.eastwoodco_dot_com/products/int_ext/1943.html

Archives are accessed from the Archive button at

http://www.type2_dot_com

Check them out, there are references to Eastwood as well as Koch's, who
will do it for you.

I haven't used Eastwood's kit or restored a wheel (yet), so I can't
attest to the quality or price (although there is a first hand
experience stashed in the Archives). I have used the Archives, and can
attest to the quality and ease of use of the search engine!

pd

&gt; I heard that they have a steering wheel repair kit, is this true ?  If so
&gt; where can I get one ?  I didnt check any archives.....dont know where they
&gt; are.
