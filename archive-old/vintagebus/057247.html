&gt; You're one of the first people in years that has discussed aluminum pushrod
&gt; expansion. I remember back in the late 70's early 80's that Gene talked a
&gt; lot about that and even advocated chrome molly pushrods on high power
&gt; engines, but felt that the growth potential in aluminum rods was negated by
&gt; the fact that it was pounded at both ends preventing any lengthening for any
&gt; duration long enough to change your geometry significantly. He felt that the
&gt; growth was not measureable and thus any engine under 70 hp and 5500 RPM
&gt; wouldn't notice a change and a factory gap would suffice.

Well, the expansion of a 10 inch aluminum pushrod alone is 0.020
inches (20 thousandths) when you heat it up from 20C to 100C, so something
else has to expand along with it or the gap would be more than used up.

Steel would expand about .0096 in the same situation, so the difference in
expansion between the two materials is 0.010.  If you were trying to make
a direct swap from aluminum to steel in this situation, you would have to
set the valves to .004 _interference_ (not gap) cold to get the same gap
at working temperature.

Obviously, this isn't what people are really doing.  If you set any gap
at all with steel pushrods you will still have a greater operating gap at
running temperature than you would have with aluminum pushrods.  I think
I'll stick with the original VW design.
