&gt;ya- the speed is related to gearing- you could get differnt speeds at the same
&gt;rpms w/ different trannies, or the same speed at the same rpms in the same bus
&gt;with different engines.   Maybe try bigger tires.     Maybe a gear oil change
&gt;would quiet things down?   How is your insulation to keep the noise out?   how
&gt;well tuned is the motor?   how about a radio?   wheels of different sizes? -
&gt;that sounds a little wonky.  So much to do, so little time, eh? 

&gt;&gt;Hey Splittie Sister!,
Yup after a work week on the road I have had a chance to either shake down
minor probs or I.D. them for this weekend. I threw the carb and dizzy into
the motor without having the time to really tweak them. Diagnosis was to
&quot;86&quot; the vaccuum dizzy and opt back to the familiar 009. Took two secs to
adjust the 30-1, set the timing correctly and it runs way way better. The
wheels are make-do 14's on the frt and 15's on rear. 205 all around 'cept
the rear passgr side which is a 195. All will be the same size and wheel
size after a few paychecks.
Tranny is funkadelic as it is a 12V ctr section with small nut axles on each
side. =0 I have located a pair of big nutters so that too will eventually
get chged out.
Thanks for the good wordz!
