Subject: Re: [VB] Re: fleetlines / 10 digit serial number/ pic

interesting M code plate.  note that the VIN is 

2056 000 252,  *NOT*

205 6000 252

while perhaps a minor, anal retentive difference, this puts the '6' (for truck) in the 'model' area of the VIN, not the 'serial #' area,  imopbo.  while with a regular  75 truck, VIN'd be 265 0000 xxx. (or was it 265 000 xxxx? I forget.)

(a 65 truck would be 265 xxx xxx)

I suspect the model of the truck w/ that m code tag is '264B'

&gt; A guy that visits my site has a fleetline. Its a 75 according to &quot;the system&quot; of his DMV, and a post
&gt; made earlier i think by clara, agrees with this vin being a 
&gt; 75 as well. It is a widebed singlecab.
&gt; Heres a pic of his wacky mplate
