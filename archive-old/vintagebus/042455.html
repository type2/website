&gt; Sta-lube makes GL4 lube, and I haven't had any problem finding it at my

Hi,

I wanted to run non-synthetic as the tranny is very old... at least for a
few months and then drain and replace (maybe with synthetic.)

All the FLAPS i've been to in missouri dont have Sta-Lube nor have they
heard of it.  We dont have pep-boys, so if anyone can suggest national
chains that carry sta-lube i'd be much obliged :)

thanks,

Steve
