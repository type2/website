Subject: Front Wheel Bearings
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Well the front wheel bearings on my 67 took a crap finally.  I had been 
procrastinating too long and now the bus is on 3 legs (ne at a time so i dont 
mix anything up.)

The drivers front had been vibrating and even making a little noise. Jacked 
him up and the wheel turned rather crunchy.  Pulled out the bearings and all 
and metal bits all over.  Not too bad but bad enough.  Weird thing is that 
somene put an early (to 63) front end on him.  Whatever.

The drum on the drivers side is toast as are the shoes, so time for a 
replacement.  Cant find a good early drum here in phx so I might just take 
one off the 57 (which are good) and use that.  Or just be stranded another 
day or two and get one from ronnie.  Really wish I had another running car 
right now.  The bus seems to dictate my life, which is getting pretty bad.  
Seems like once I start replacing things, others things break.

So due to my own procrastination I am once again at the mercy of the VW gods, 
stuck in my driveway praying for some type of miracle.  

Moral;

If you know somethings wrong or suspect something is wrong check it or have 
someone else look at it.  Even the smallest problem can become a major 
headache.

just had to vent a little
