&lt;&lt; Perhaps you two could discuss this over the phone in a mature manner 
rather than post derogatory comments to the list. Sometimes it can be hard to 
describe parts &amp; things through email. Don't forget how much negative 
postings can seriously effect someone's reputation (both the poster and the 
postee).

I have bought and sold things long distance over the phone (before email) and 
also via email and 

1.  is can be hard to describe exactly a part, or understand exactly what 
part someone is looking for.   People use different names for parts, or the 
same name for a different thing.  remember 'barndoors'

2.  people space things out.  I have had people say how they need something 
and need it now, but since someone can forget for a year or forever to send a 
check, I dislike sending stuff before payment arrives.  Burnt hand remembers 
the fire.

3.  people can space out sending money for a few months, then send it and 
want the part immediately, even if you told they you would be out of town 
then, and not able to get the mail.

4. Most of these people do this as a hobby, not a business, and may not 
respond immediately.   Self included.  but as long as I am haven't taken 
someone's money or agreed to send something I don't feel obligated to
