Subject: Tin Questions

Hi - I have a complete motor I pulled out of a bus that by using Tom 
Wilsons book, I've determined to have a type 3 1600 case.

  My question is, If I were to buy a standard rebuilt 1600 longblock, 
would all of the cooling tin, fan shroud, and other stuff bolt and 
screw back on?  I thought I had read that after a certain year, cases 
became &quot;universal&quot;.  Before removing the engine, everything seemed snug 
and in place, and looked correct.

I'm at the bottom of my learning curve regarding engine stuff, as my 
Westy I recently sold had a freshly rebuilt motor which only required 
routine maintenance, so I'm starting from scratch as I attempt to get 
the 60dc out onto the road.

Thanks for any help
Don J
