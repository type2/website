Subject: RE: [VB] retractable seatbelt installation webpage

Good stuff,

I have a 63 DC that never had seatbelts, anyone willing to give me some =
placement locations/measurements?  Also, what about the rear seat over =
the storage compartment, how were seatbelts installed there? =20

Is there a source for the bug brackets or do I need to search for a =
junkyard?
