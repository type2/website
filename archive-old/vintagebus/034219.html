a lot of bashing by a few people for a person who loves his bus.
he did have 4 good tires, the tags, well better then putting on fake ones,
if he was a trouble maker when the officer ran a check he would of had
warrants and been arrested, he did make it, windows, so what, every time I
go to Cal in the summer I see buses all the time without window frames,
lowered by removing torsion bars, straight axle rear ends with type 1 drums,
talk about unsafe (flame suit on), he probably didn't have AAA million mile
towing, so he solved a fuel problem and kept on going, I would probably do
the same if I was in the same situation, I guess I should get bashed for
beating on my carb with a rock when my float stuck at 6 am Sunday on my way
back down to BBB IV, had no tools, jack, spare, etc. guess I should have
called a tow truck, NOT, I improvised and got back on the road, sure there
were things wrong with his bus, but there are probably things wrong with all
our buses, so who are we to judge!!. We all have done stupid things before
and I am first to admit it, some of my buses are real ugly, people can't
believe they are on the road, but do they know about my 2000 dollar drive
train under it? Let well enough alone, one day Beanies bus might win the
classic for best panel, then will your tunes change. Uncle Jerry took a junk
heap hippy bus, that should have been parted out, put a lot of love, heart,
soul and money in it and brought it back to life, and it was a long process,
but it's back, and safe. We have all saved and destroyed buses, drove show
winners and major losers, so let well enough be and fix your own bus before
you worry about someone else's

just my opinion   Ronnie---
