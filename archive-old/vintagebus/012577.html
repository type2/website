Hey all,
i posted this a while ago but didn't get but one or two responses. i
didn't worry about it but now im trying to get the bus on the road and
need turn signals and brake lights. there is this big Hella relay box
on the floor and i think its fried cause none of the signals work any
more. i took the wires from the turn switch off it and tried to hook
them up through one of those $1 flasher relays, no luck. it doesn't
appear that there is a hot lead for the switch, i've tried all the
wires. now i'm really going nuts cause i know this system is so basic
and i can't figure it out. i have looked high and low for a new box,
but to no avail.
here's the numbers: 111 953 225
anyone have one of these? my bus is a early '66, originally 6V now
12V. if i can't figure this one out, its going to be a sweet three way
toggle controling my signals:(
much thanks,

Bob Margiotti
