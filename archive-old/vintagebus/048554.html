Meredith,

If you are just putting your dogs in it, you may want to just buy a tent
from Walmart.  You could get twice the tent for half the money.  I don't
think I would want to ruin an original tent using it as a kennel.


&gt;At a reasonable cost, I know Ha Ha!
&gt;
&gt;But what I'm looking for is one that goes to the, um &quot;bay window
&gt;campers&quot;, our 72 to be exact.
&gt;
&gt;I ask you nice folks as I figure someone has got to have one and never
&gt;use it with your Split!
&gt;
&gt;The condition does not need to be perfect and would hope the price would
&gt;reflect such, we mainly want the
&gt;original one so we can take our dogs on more camping trips and be able
&gt;to allow them more sleeping space
&gt;outside the bus, but still be contained by the flooring of the tent.
&gt;
&gt;If you have one please let me know here or at vwtruck_at_concentric_dot_net
