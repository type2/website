My 75 bus and 65 double cab are insured through
Hagerty (www.hagerty_dot_com), and they sound similar to
the company you mentioned.  The cars have to be 25
years old, not driven as the only vehicle or a work
vehicle, the driver has to have 5 years experience,
etc.
I have full coverage, no deductible, on both VWs,and
I think I pay under $150 a year total (two VWs).  
Of course, I have to have another car for my primary
vehicle, but that's no problem here in Wisconsin,
land of salted roads in the winter.
