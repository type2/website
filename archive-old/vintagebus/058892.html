Subject: RE: [VB] Dual circuit upgrade

Tried the bug conversion and it works but makes for a real spongy pedal. The
best bet in my OPINION is to step up and buy the 67 master. CORRECT part for
a early bus. I am still not sold on putting a disc brake master on a drum
brake car. It doesn't work on dune buggys or bajas, so I still can't figure
out how it can work properly on a 4 drum brakle bus. On the buggys it locks
up the front brakes prematurely. The reason it doesn't on the bus is probaly
due to the weight, but what happens in a panic stop on a slick road?

ronnie   just my opinion

my life is worth $175.00 dollars

Thanks for the info.  What about using a 19.0mm Bug MC?  Should give
increased pressure at the brake pads?

&gt;
&gt; &gt; According to the RMMW catalog, admittedly not as accurate as Bently
etc.,
&gt; &gt; the 50-67(66?) bus MC has a 22.2mm bore.  Both the 211 611 021Q for
'68-'69
&gt; &gt; bus and the 211 611 021J for a '70 bus also have a 22.2mm bore and are
&gt; &gt; non-servo units.  Has anyone tried either of these?  The local shop
doesn't
&gt; &gt; carry these in stock so I could not physically compare to see if the
&gt; &gt; mounting is the same.  If someone could look at them and let me know
which
&gt; &gt; looks to be the best match I would be willing to try it out and report.
&gt;
&gt; You cannot use the 68-70 masters because you cannot get a reservoir with a
&gt; screw cap to fit them. The two holes are farther apart then the 67 and 72+
&gt; masters. 68-70 is [if memory serves me] 100mm. All the others, including
VW,
&gt; Mercedes, Volvo, are 85mm center-to-center.
&gt; Unless you used the upper reservoir, tube, and lower reservoir from 68
&gt; [one-year-only set-up] or 69/70.....
