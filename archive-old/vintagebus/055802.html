Subject: Re: [VB] Not promoting a sale, just wondering...

Windows are smashed on the right side and the cargo door is ripped off the
hinges.

I think it rolled to the right into a ditch, causing the damage on the right
side, bounced, preserving the roof and hit the other side of the ditch on
the left side.

How about that for a theory?

&gt; I bet I know what happened to this bus. I would be
&gt; willing to bet that this bus fell off the shop lift at
&gt; the place where it was being restored. At first I
&gt; thought that someone had rolled it but If it had been,
&gt; most of the windows would have been smashed and the
&gt; entire roof warped.
