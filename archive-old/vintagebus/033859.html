I'm scratching my head on this one, and I'm about ready to say &quot;screw it&quot;
and buy a new carb....

I just rebuilt a late model Solex/Brosol 30-31-PICT for my 67' with a 1600
DP engine.  It has a .009 dizzy.  I bolted on the adapter plate and the
carb, fired her up and she idles like a champ.  The problem is that if you
give her any gas, she gasps and cuts off.  Will not progress at all.  So, I
took the carb off and made sure that the accelerator pump was pumping a
stream of gas into the venturi, and yep, no problems there.  I also adjusted
the squirter so it squirts down the middle of the venturi.  I bolt the carb
back on and now it revs up but it won't idle at all!!  Any ideas??
