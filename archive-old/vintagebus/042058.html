&gt; defunct is no amnesty, the person that buys them at the auction has as much

&gt; Handy as they may be, they do belong to someone and they may come to get
&gt; them.

Well, the metal crates I have were designed to hold glass bottles and in
fact were abandoned at my folk's house when the dairy went under and
never picked the crates up from the house where they were used for
doorstep delivery.  I suppose that if a subsequent owner shows up they can
have them back as long as they are willing to pay reasonable storage
charges (say $2 a month each for the last 30 years or so)  :)
