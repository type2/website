Subject: another middle seat question

hey i have a 66 kombi and im trying to get some middle and rear seats.  
Unfortunately i find bay seats frequently but never split seats. my question 
is, will the bay window seats still fit in my 66, as in are the holes in the 
floor in the same place? will i need to do any type of work to make them 
fit? what other types of things am i going to have to prepare for in order 
to make it work?

thanks
cory
66 kombi
