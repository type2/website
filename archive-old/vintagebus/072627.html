Subject: '64-'71 TypeII beam wanted&gt;Phx AZ

Now that it's incredibly hot in Phoenix and makes no sense to work outside I am
gearing up to work on my '63 EZ Camper. I have a Big Nutter tranny to slide
into it but am trolling for a large brake front end.

Anyone in the SoCal/AZ/NM area who might be coming through Phx this summer is
encouraged to contact me in this regard.

I am also entertaining a balljoint beam with discs as a possible upgrade.
Willing to make adjustments to recover stock splittie height. I might adjust
back to go up! =) Drop spindles need not apply. If you are going low and want
to junk that stock height shight well then dump it here! I intend to do up a
SouthAfrican off-roadermobile hamshack. BFGoodrich here I come! =)

Please Pmail me at ellisjames_at_yahoo_dot_com Reasonable prices only please.
