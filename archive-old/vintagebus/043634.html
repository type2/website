&gt;P.O. promises me it ran great for him, but it has been sitting all 
&gt;winter.  I try to start it, it cranks &amp; cranks, but nothing.  I spray
&gt;a little starting fluid in the carb and it starts and run for a few
&gt;seconds before dying.  I repeat, same thing.

The gas is probably stale.  Compare the smell at the filler cap to
one of your daily drivers...fresh gas (like, bought yesterday) has a
much &quot;sharper&quot; odor than stale gas...it's hard to describe but it's
fairly obvious when you compare.  Even if you're not sure, replacing
it with fresh gas is cheap, can't hurt, and takes one of the variables
out of the equation.

The easiest way to drain it is probably to roll under the Bus with an
appropriate empty gas can and pull the rubber fuel line off of the
steel line that goes through the tin (near the clutch arm).  Put the 
rubber fuel line in the can, go up top, and open the gas cap.  Watch
carefully to make sure you don't overflow the can.

PLEASE strongly consider replacing all the rubber fuel lines at this
time.  They are cheap and a burnt-up Bus is not.  You should have
one piece from the tank outlet, over the tranny, to the steel line
that goes through the tin, one piece from that line to the pump,
and another piece from the pump to the carb.  Make sure there is
a grommet around the steel line where it goes through the tin!  If
you don't have one, you can fake one for now by slitting a 3&quot;/8cm
piece of the old fuel hose and sliding it over the steel line.

Once you have the old gas drained, and the lines replaced, get a couple 
of gallons of fresh gas and pour them in the tank.  It'll take a
bit of cranking to get the fuel pump primed again, but once the fresh
gas hits it, it should go like crazy.

If you still have trouble, your fuel pump might be weak, or the carb
might be gunked up.  My Dad's '74 Beetle sat outside for a couple of
years and there was a half-inch of gunk in the float bowl!  Two trips
through the carb bucket and much TLC later and it runs fine.

Good luck!
