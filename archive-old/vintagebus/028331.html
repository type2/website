Subject: OC Westy Ride

Any responsible adult that's coming to the show and would like to drive
a splittie (not a pretty one mind you) to OCTO and doesn't have a ride
can drive my '67 Westy H/T along with me and the 62 DC.  That is, as
long as you treat other peoples things with respect and promise not to
sue me if you get in a wreck (couldn't hurt the bus any more than it
already is) and don't steal it (I need the interior ;-)

At this point we'll be leaving Fullerton early (6 am ?) to pick up a
person and so I can get in early and get a swap spot.  Contact me and
we'll arrange details.  I'm working late this week so not sure if I'll
go to any of the thurs. fri. evening stuff.

Steve
