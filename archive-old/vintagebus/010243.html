Subject: Located some key blanks
Date: Sun, 25 Mar 2001 10:44:46 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

At MEAD Lumber where I work in Beatrice, NE, we are switching key blank
suppliers and so I was able to get ahold of the cross reference catalog.  I
couldn't believe it when I was scanning through the VW section when they had
various VW models listed (411/412/Beetle/Bus/Dasher/Jetta/etc.) and WHOA
what's this?  Blanks listed for VW Buses back to 1966/67.  Unfortunately,
when I looked at the key codes and availability status, it was listed as
DISC.  However, my workmate Ron ordered the minimum order of blanks (10 pcs)
and the order went through.  It's going to cost about 4 to 5 bucks to get
them in and then it's a simple matter of me running the key cutter machine
and making my own keys.  We'll see if the blanks actually do come in and if
they do, I'll put some pix up of them and then those of you who would like
some keys made, I'd be glad to do a couple for you.  I'm not equipped to do
the # matching and making a key from scratch so I would need a good original
to cut from.  I learned how to cut keys when I worked at a local discount
store.  It seemed the normal flunkies would churn out crappy keys and make
the customers mad and soon people would come in looking for me because my
keys always worked - and I was just the maintenance guy!  Where everyone
would screw up is in comparing the blanks to make sure the &quot;stop&quot; of the new
key would line up appropriately with the &quot;stop&quot; of the old key.  Other keys
would often be worn so bad that the depth was screwed up.  I would often
just site the differences in the blank and the worn original key and
manually adjust the blank to make a correct cut.  Usually if it didn't work
the first time, the 2nd one would AND I never had to give up and say,
&quot;Sorry - it just isn't working.&quot;  I remember my grandpa telling me at the
lumber yard (where my occasional key-cutting skills are called upon), &quot;See -
that's why you should be in here instead of out there hauling sheetrock.&quot;
