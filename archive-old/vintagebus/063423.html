Subject: Re: hit brakes, park lights come on

I can tell that the nights are getting longer.  More exterior lighting
questions.  :)

&gt;I have the german head lights in my 59 and when I apply the brake my park=
=20
&gt;lights come on inside the headlights.

Check the grounds at the rear tail lights.  If the grounds are bad, the
brake lights will try to ground through the parking lights and can cause
the effect you are seeing.  If you want a test, unplug the parking light
(gray) wires at the tail lights and step on the brakes again.  If your
front parking lights stay off, you definitely have bad grounds at the
tail lights.  You may find that your brake lights don't even work with
the parking light wires unplugged.

&gt;When the headlight switch is out for the parklights nothing changes that=

&gt;I can see.

Have someone else turn on the park lights and then step on the brakes.
There should be a definite and noticeable brightness change in the rear
lights - the brake filaments are nominally seven times as bright as the
tail filaments.  If you can't tell much difference when the brake lights
are on, definitely look into the grounds at your tail lights.  You better
look into this before T=DCV does it for you...=20

Don't forget that there are color wiring diagrams for most every air-cooled
VW online at http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring .
