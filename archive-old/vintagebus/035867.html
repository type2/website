well today was a waste.  im in central jersey, and yesterday was 74 degrees 
and sunny.
today sunday was the first vw show and swap of the season for me.
i loaded up the truck and trailer w/baywindow.   and headed out it was 34 
degrees
in the morning.    and raining, i got about 10 mi. and it starts snowing and 
snowing,
   listening to the news thier saying 4&quot; of it , im like you gotta be kiding 
me, it was 74
yesterday.

i get there, in what looks like a small blizzard.    and i see some people i 
know
from other swaps, 60 Camper, and 67 double cab w/hoops,canvas, rack, 
ladder,and matching trailer. turguise and white.
they drove up from virginia, and where about to turn and go back home.
   what a waste of a day, i humg around a little while longer to see if 
anybody else 
would show up.     then i went home and got back in bed by 9:30.
im so bummed out, now i gotta wait a few more weeks for a show.

oh well just trying to vent off some vw wintersteam.
thanks for letting me rant.
