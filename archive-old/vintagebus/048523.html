Subject: Safari's

Since I am still behind my reading and this thread
should be dead by now, I still will put my sense in,
not cents.

I wear glasses, and even with a helmet, face shield,
and windscreen on my Honda motorcycle, I would STILL
would get crud into my eyes.  I don't miss riding much.

Test drove a '58 bus with safari's once, hated it,
got more crud in my eyes, made them water, messed
with my ability to see and be a safe driver.  Maybe
if there was a bugscreen, but other than hauling
very long things, useless.

Didn't buy the bus 'cause it had been lowered and
didn't want the hassles of undoing the work.
