&gt;I was wondering if anyone has any information about the so-called 
&quot;side-loader&quot; Single Cab.
One of our original members of SV2s had one. Tom Stone in San Diego. 
In fact, he was spotted recently in the same bus at the Qualcomm swap 
meet. I also have a repro of a special models booklet that I'm 
getting ready to post online. It has all the info you need, including 
who did the conversion. It wasn't a VW built conversion, but then 
again neither was a Westfalia! They were fully endorsed and sold by 
VW, though.

I was just browsing the book a couple of nights ago (what a VW 
geek...I read that kind of stuff in bed), so I know where it is even!
