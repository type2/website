i would like to say that i feel really grateful that my 2500 or so round trip to the 
classic in zapper mostly on I-5 was successful other than me panicking regarding 
overheating but i just drove slower and stopped more and all was well.  got some cool 
pictures of zapper in sequoia and yosemite both on the way home.
