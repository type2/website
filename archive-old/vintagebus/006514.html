Thank you Thom for the advise.  BTW, I left several unanswered messages with
Izz's, finally last week a woman returned my call stating he would not have
any until mid-late April.

&gt; &gt; Creative Engineering sells front Safari kit (primer) for $420 - for a

&gt; &gt; Wolfgang Int, sells them for $389 - I take it it's worth the extra few
bucks
&gt; &gt; for the Creative?
&gt;
&gt; Even with postage, I think it's worth it.  The CE safaris at least attempt
&gt; to look original; the wolfgang ones don't.  Having personally had both,
&gt; I'm gonna have to come down on the side of CE, unless someone can convince
&gt; me the quality of the Wolfgang/busboys units have somehow miraculously
&gt; improved.  Izzy's would have been a good stateside option, but he appears
&gt; to be MIA.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Just noticed that Creative also sells pop-out window frames.  I was just
&gt; &gt; about to order a set of 6 from Wolfgang - any one have recommendations
&gt; &gt; either way?
&gt;
&gt; I tried the wolfgang popouts, and ended up sending them back.  The channel
&gt; profile was correct, but the radiusing of the corners was not only
different
&gt; than the originals, but each corner was different.  I haven't seen the CE
&gt; popouts yet.
