You can be pretty sure that the pump reading is accurate, as they are usually
calibrated by a weights and measures agency.
&gt;&gt;
Interesting, I'd heard they were up to 10% off...  there was a recent discussion
on the Type 3 list about this, it came about because of a few people putting
11 gallons into their 10 gallon tanks.

&gt;&gt;As with all measurements, your accuracy goes up with increased quantity,
so go most of the way through the tank.
&gt;&gt;
Wow, my tape measure measure 2' more accurately than 1' ?
