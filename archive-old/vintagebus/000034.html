 I named the single cab &quot;Super Sonic&quot;, though I call him &quot;Sonic&quot; for short.
 I had a long talk with him last night and I sure we're gonna be pals.
 So what's my question? Where are all the info #'s on this truck? There is
 one to the right behind the engine on the fire wall, but I have yet to find
 any others. Do I not have an &quot;M&quot; plate? Where is the chassis #?
 Thanks for the help. &gt;&gt;

congrats on getting the truck going!!!   what a great feeling to drive it.

ya- no m codes plates before circa ch # 398 000, though I had a 59 w/o the m 
code plate.   The body number is in that location (behind passenger seat on 
bulkhead) in the non m code plate buses. This is similar to, but not the same 
as, the VIN/chasis number.  The VIN is in the engine compartment.   On that 
plate you saw.  

if the u shaped trans carrier under the trans is round in cross section, 
rather than U shaped in cross section , you are the proud owner of a 
Wolfsberg production bus,  where the transporters were made till circa VIN 
178 000
