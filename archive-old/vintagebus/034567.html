Yesterday I got my newest VW. 
March 19 1963 a double door panel in Dove Blue left the factory on it's way 
to the Houston port. It was bought new by the Lone Star Brewery, and was 
painted with a Lone Star paint job (metallic gold and white, one logo on each 
side as well as a small one on the hatch, bumpers and hubcaps painted gold 
and wheels paintd red) on the outside. It was used as a beer delivery van. 
The logos were painted over (whitewash) when it was sold to the 2nd owner in 
the 70's. He drove it around town until the early 90's when he sold it to a 
fellow club member on the condition that he would never repaint it! Well 
about a month ago this guy stumbled on Everett's VW Planet classifieds and 
now it's mine. I actually had to fight for it because another guy had made a 
deal with him already and was planning on restoring it (to factory original). 
Luckily he wasn't able to come up with the money and I was next it line... So 
the Lone Star Beer delivery van will live on.
This week I will try to strip the whitewash off the logos. If that doesn't 
work I guess I'll have to have them re-painted on. I'll take some pictures 
once I get it cleaned up and driving(needs clutch and brakes) Also in Texas I 
think there is an extra cost license plate that would match the bus 
perfectly. It's got a yellow/gold star with a red and blue background and 
says Lone Star Proud at the bottom. If an Texans on the the list have any 
info on the special plates let me know, or I can let you know when I find out.
What could be cooler than an original paint (sort of) logo'd beer delivery?
(being that I don't drink, I guess a Coca-Cola bus could be cooler)
Thanks,
Brian
