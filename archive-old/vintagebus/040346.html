Subject:  Kumho 185sr15


More tyre stuff.  I have been shopping for tyres myself
recently for my deluxe project - I wanted radials (bus will do too many 
real miles to be comfortable with crossplies)
and as close to a 'stockish' look
and rolling diameter as I could get.  

Kumho make a 'European' 185sr15
(82% aspect ratio) with a suitable load rating....In Oz this
is the narrowest radial available that still gives you a rolling
diameter of 26.9 inches (equiv to original 6.40 x 15 cross plies)
They're imported from the US so must be available over there....

Cooper also make a 195/75 15 called the 'trendsetter'.  
Same rolling diameter with a white band...awfully expensive in Oz though.  

Don't ask about the price of Cokers here!
