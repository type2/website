&gt;VW had bleprints showing how
&gt;to cut and shave styrofoam panels to fit the areas in the cargo walls and
even
&gt;ceiling.  Plus paneling blueprints to cover the insulation.  This and using
&gt;tar to coat the sheet metal first should do the trick without rusting.  We
are
&gt;starting to remove and replace the rusty metal in our panel and do a body
work
&gt;and paint next.  Then are planning to try out styrofoam panels from our
local
&gt;hardware store.

I have been using the foil covered insulation board for some years. It is
simple to cut to shape, and by cutting vees on the inner side you can match
curves and provide an unbroken vapor barrier to the sheet metal. The 1&quot; is a
nice snug fit and provides excellent support for the tight bends of the
ceiling panels in campers. In some areas like the cab ceiling it will be too
thick and the 3/4&quot; should be used. Properly glued and the seams taped with
foil tape, this provides excellent insulation without adding to the rusting
process. It is also nicer to work with and less messy than either fiberglass
or styrofoam.
