     Nobody remembers the letters that get to them they just remember that
they didn't get right when they wanted it.  We are human and God made us to
make mistakes other wise how would we learn.  Every mistake that I make is a
chance to do better the next time.  I am sure that Ron is alot like us,not
perfect just human.

&gt; I ordered KYB's from Bus Depot last year, a pair for the front and a pair
for the back. They were sent quickly, and were much cheaper than RMMW. I
haven't ordered anything from them lately, but I'm satisfied with the
business I had with them...
&gt;sorry, I have to get this off my chest...a while ago I posted to the list
the numerous problems I have had with Bus Depot operators and getting
accurate information when ordering. after getting frustrated each time,
turning to another vendor for parts, I never actually ordered from them...
until Tuesday. (shocks, probably the easiest thing) after spending about 15
minutes on the phone with a confused employee he got the numbers for the
shocks I needed. I was instantly skeptical again, but had to order, they are
about $13 cheaper there than RMM.

got the stuff today and sure enough 2 of the 4 are wrong. called back and
talked to a woman who again couldn't come up with part numbers for the
correct shocks. after coming to a conclusion of the correct shocks she said
she would &quot;make an adjustment in the computer&quot;. what gives, hasn't anyone
ever ordered KYB's for a '66 bus out there? is it just me and my bad luck? I
guess &quot;good help is hard to find&quot; was coined for a reason.

sorry to waste more space for my rants, nobody else I know would understand.
