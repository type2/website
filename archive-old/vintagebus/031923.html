&lt;&lt; I saw what you meant by the close proximity of the cable end and the
 solenoid electricals. When I was under and saw that, I thought hmm, very
 un-german. I had the battery disconnected so I was able to examine the full
 swing of the arch, and all is clear.&gt;&gt;
Hi Glen,
Yes it is perilously close.  So must be set correctly and tested as you did
with the battery dissconnected.

&lt;&lt; For some reason I was mistakenly thinking that to remove the value (Valve
not value right Glen?  EEE&amp;B) I would have to pull the engine, and tank.
Don't know why, but that was behind my tone of reservation. Your remark about
a static discharge is well taken.  Gasoline and its vapours frighten me, so
I'll slip out the value and try and work on it rather then use air. (years
ago I  was working in the woods in the Canadian northwest and a welder was
asked to cut up an old water tank.  The new fellow drove out the wrong spur
and touched his torch to a fuel tank instead: empty of fluid but full of
vapour. Fortunately he was standing aside of the tank and not on it, but the
explosion ripped the tank apart and destroyed the welders hearing. The tank
split like a can of beans.)&gt;&gt;
 Exactly.  In the old literature when cutting the tank for installing the
senders for Dehne, and Motormeter gauges they instructed that to make sure
the tank was full of fuel to make sure of no vapors.  VW reccomended blowing
out the tank with air to keep down the fuel vapor level.  Personally we would
just fill the tank with water!

&lt;&lt;Yesterday when I was under the bus to look once again at the assemble I
noticed a slight &quot;sweating&quot; around the base of the value. Something not tight
up there, so that will allow me to address that problem as well.  Regarding
the seal itself. I'm wondering if that is something I could rebuild/recut
with gasket material and then seal with a gasket sealant? Any suggestions how
this would react with gasoline? I've got a tube of 3M Adesivo para Juntas de
Motores Diesel, that was included in a set of pistons and cylinders I picked
up in South America and was thinking that might work. &gt;&gt;
First, the old reserve switch has a nut attaching it to the fuel tank.  This
is not just a plain old nut, but one that has both right hand and left hand
threads.  This allows you to hold the valve in one postion and undo the nut
&gt;from both the tank and valve at the same time.  The same for tightening when
you tighten the nut it pulles both parts together by only rotating the nut.
Next did you install the brass fuel filter sock over the valve, and if you
did did you install a gasket both above and below the sock mounting rim?  If
no then this is why you are having leaks.  The gasket are only about $.60
each and easy to get.  If you have to use a sealant make sure it is fuel and
alcohal proof.  Most likely though if you need sealant it means that you
really need either both gaskets, or sanding and polishing the surfaces that
seat against these gaskets.  Eric&amp;Barb
