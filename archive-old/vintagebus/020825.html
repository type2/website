Subject: RE: [VB] Score! jealous

Jon,

Aside from my $20 auction bus, (and as you mentioned,
my $2 truck), remember the three busses that I got in
trade for a single cab shell?  I sold one of them to
you, got lots of parts from the others, and then Brett
gave me a sub-hatch shell in trade for putting it's
transmission in the single cab.

However it did take me five trips (100 miles each way)
to pick them up.  The first trip, I took my trailer
and my partner Barry took a tow bar, and we put Barry
on the trailer when his trans blew and froze up solid.
 Second trip, I got a bus.  Third trip Jon
(hazetguy_at_earthlink_dot_net aka bus-snob) Furst went with
me and we were threatened with jail for stealing
busses.  Fourth and fifth trips, we got busses, but
&quot;whew&quot;, 1000 miles for three busses!

JP
