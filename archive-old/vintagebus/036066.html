Subject: deano dinosaur manifolds and webbers.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I'm sure there are some vintage speed folks on the list so thought I would 
post this. I ran into a fellow with a set of deano dinosaur manifolds and 
either 40 or 42 (sorry 34 pict 3 is the fanciest carb I have) dcnf weber 
carbs at a yard sale the other day, He wants a hefty $550 for the pair, but 
seemed reasonable price wise on other things, so maybe they are worth it, I 
have no idea. If its an outrageous price please dont bash the messenger. If 
anyone is seriously interested, p-mail and I can help set it up.
