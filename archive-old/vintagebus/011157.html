while the donut clamp system on the old ACVWs is I agree, not perfect, I dont 
think that is the source of the exhaust  smell  in the heat.  Look at your 
muffler and heater boxes.   Also try turning heat on just one side then the 
other.   if one side sticnks, and the other doesn't, you have a bad heater 
box on the stinky side.   If it stinks both sides, bad muffler and or heater 
boxes.

?  wonder if the tubes you put in to help mate the heater box to muffler 
resticts exhaust flow and if so what that does to the motor?
