Hi Richard,
That is to be expected with any tranny wether newly rebuilt or 250,000 miles 
later as long as it has had regular gear oil changes and not drag raced.  It 
is a good idea to install magnetic plugs in all the fill and drain plug 
locations in both the tranny and RGBs.
  As for saving up $$$ it is wise to have at least $1,000 in the piggy bank 
just in case of a engine or tranny rebuild!
