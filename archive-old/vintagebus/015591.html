¡°The single color busses tend to fade into primer.
     Somewhere around 61 they switched to painting the interior the top color

     rather than the bottom.
     Am I wrong?????¡±

I am pretty sure my bus is all original paint. It is a '65 Kombi-Ez Camper.
The exterior is all pearl white and the interior is partly pearl
white...except If i remember correctly the aea behind the front seats is all
painted grey.

I am not sure what color the underisde is painted...perhaps just a sprayed on
dirt-because that is pretty much all i can see down there....
