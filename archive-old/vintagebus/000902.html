Good chromers are getting harder to find... seems that the EPA is getting
tougher and tougher (and rightfully so).  There's lots of 'industrial
chromers' out there but you won't get good show chrome quality plating.  I
just took a bunch of my 59 double cab parts down to one of the last guys in
Oregon and he even said he has to quit in a month or so.


If you want, contact Star Bright Chroming 503-632-4414 and ask for Vic.  I
hope he doesn't mind the publicity.

Actually, I'm looking for someone to do some cadmium plating... anybody know
where to do this???

59 double cab
...and many others...


was writ...
&gt;Can anyone make recommendations of places to get parts chromed? I can send
&gt;the stuff to 'em by mail.
