I finally got that seized to bolt off of my Westy, and put the new shock on
with lots of anti-seize.  I found that the old shock on the driver's side
was still working, the passenger side one was not working at all.  It is
interesting to note that with this information in mind, the driver's side
kingpin bushings are fine, while on the passenger side, the bushings are
shot, as is the tie rod on that side.

I believe that the worn shock allowed the suspension to get much of the road
impacts, and thusly wore out the parts on that side.

Shock absorbers are as important (if not more so) for the protection of your
running gear as they are for the comfort of humans.

I have spoken....
