Subject: Re: [VB] Help with bus restoration

om,

I am planning on putting an entire new interior in my 66 Samba, as part of 
my overall resto.  In general, here are the steps I took (and most of this 
was found through patient searching on eBay):

1. For sound proofing, I obtained two 36 sq ft bulk boxes of Dynamat 
Extreme, which I intend to place in strategic chunks around the bus.  In my 
humble opinion, you can't get much better than this stuff for complete sound 
supression. ($400.00)

2.For heating/cooling insulation and further sound proofing, I used a bulk 
role of 3/8&quot; aluminum-reinfored fibre tech padding with fiberglass mesh, 
which I cut into panels and placed on top of the dynamat on the floor, 
walls, and roof.  ($40.00)

3. For a vapor barrier, I used regular 5 mil plastic wrap, the kind people 
often used to cover their windows in winter. ($5.00)


4. I acquired a set of basic vinal-coated masonite interior panels 
(including the rear quaters) from ISP West (also, an eBay auction).  
($320.00), as well as a set of interior screws and nylon clips.

5. I had a set of custom bucket seats made by sewfine interiors of 
Littleton, CO, along with rear seat pads and a bed pad to complete my 
rock-n-roll rear seat/bed (including mounting brackets and 3-point harnesses 
- $1,200.00)

6. I purchased a TMI carpet kit from Bus Boys (which during our test fit, 
did a remarkable job of conforming to the interior). ($200.00, I think)

7.And last, but not least, I pulled a stove/fridge/sink unit from a wrecked 
80s Westfalia to serve as my kitchen while on the road.


Hope some of this helps.  I would also like to know what others out there 
have done, and if they have any suggestions for improvement.

Richard
