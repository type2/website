&gt; Hello all,
&gt;         Im new to the list and I come in search of parts.

I have been pmailing back and forth with TJ over the last couple of months
about DCs and suggested that he pop over to this list and take advantage of the
expertise found here.  He is out on the east coast, recently returned from his
honeymoon and started this DC resto all about the same time.  With those three
things in his life, he might need all the help we can give him [with the DC ;-)
]

Specifically any info about what parts would cross (doors, floors, deck lids)
between the '65 DC and what year range buses.   Anybody got any spare parts he
can work some deals for?  Remember, one assumes he wants to see his first
anniversary.

Scott
