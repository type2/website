Subject: Re: what kind of side windows are these.
Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My main man Klye mentioned that one style of the window frames were inserted
into panel vans that had been converted into campers. True!
There also was a very similar style that *did* fit into a Kombi style body.
Meaning that the bus body was manufactured with the window holes with which
we all are familiar. Im not talking about the Westy style jalousie windows.

I mention this, as last year Rex Eastman was kind enough to offer to sell me
a set of the Kombi style thick framed center crank style windows. I saddly
had to pass as the rat '63 was originally a panel and did not have the same
mounting system.

Kombi style mount into the window holes
Panel style mount via a two piece sandwich on either side of the body metal.

I admit that I probably don't know the definitive answers on this. Just have
tripped on myself in this subject area to have gained some insight.

Contact Rex Eastman &lt;vws4sale_at_inreach_dot_com&gt; or Jim Thompson &lt;uvx196_at_juno_dot_com&gt; 
for this or any other of your parts needs.
