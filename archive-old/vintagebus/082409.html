Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor rebuilder???

Hiya Richard,

You want to contact Philbin Manufacturing here in Portland, Oregon.  Visit 
their website at www.philbingroup_dot_com/rebuilt/distributors.htm
When I last visited them they had rebuilt 205Ts in the box, on the shelf.  Or 
they can rebuild yours.

Give 'em a shot

Mike
