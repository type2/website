For those of you that didn't go, you should of. Here are a few things I saw
Sat night for sale. 2 bus roof racks, 80 and 125 dollars, Westy tent
complete,poles, stakes, bags, etc. yellow and gray, privy and sides never
put up 800 dollars, Sundial tent, nice top, sides ratty but fixable, sold
for 80 dollars. Slash rear deluxe bumper with trim, 90 dollars. Set for
complete 65 chrome bumpers 300 dollars. 67 hardtop delux, running, 2000
(rust free and a walk through) 59 combi drove there 1200 dollars. A box of
bus speedo's 10 a piece, your choice. A bucket full of seat clamps, base
plates, etc 8 dollars. Ambo fans 1 for 200 and the other for 150 dollars.
There were not that many vendors there so those that came just wanted to
blow out there stuff being a small turn-out. I have always found that when
the weather is bad Pomona is great. Also turn key 1600, rebuilt 500 dollars
and there were 2 of these. Complete Westy front bumper with tent bracket 50
bucko's, 2 Westy hatch top sections,
50 dollars a piece. There were a few sellers from out of state who made the
drive and didn't want to bring there stuff home. There were also at least 5,
1 wheel trailers there for sale also.
