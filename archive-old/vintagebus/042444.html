Subject: empi 5 spokes on a 61 bus...
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10003201259400.32442-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

I have a set of 15 inch factory wheels for my bus, and intend on using
those, but they are NOT tubeless wheels.

I have heard a copuple of people say they are and others say they arent.
What says to me that they arent is that they dont have the bead safety
lock... a raised ridge at the inner edge of where the bead seals.  Look at
14 inch bus rim, and any rim rated for tubeless, they all have this lock.
my 61 bus rims dont.

Anyway, what is the offset on those empi 5 spokes, will they fit my 61 bus
with a 67 front beam and 205/75 15 tires?  or am i stuck with the stock
tires with tubes. (i know people say they'll work without, but i dont
trust it...) With the empi's i'd get a true 15 inch tubeless rated
wheel... which i'd prefer as tubes lower your mileage. (and gas isnt that
cheap lately...) plus i'd reduce unsprung weight so i could corner like an
f-1 race car (well maybe im exadurating...)

thanks,

Steve
