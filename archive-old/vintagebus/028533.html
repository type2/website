Subject: mid-day report

Well, I finally got the time and energy to pull the motor on the 62
today.  The main seal is leaky and it soaked the clutch...but I knew of
this when I bought the bus.  I'm also going to be replacing pushrod tube
seals.  I think the oil cooler seals are leaky too, but I'm changing
over to a doghouse oil cooler and fan shroud anyways, so those (and the
oil filter/cooler system on there now) will be gone by the end of the
day.  While taking the bumper off a little while ago, I notice that my
drivers side rear wheel cylinder is leaky :(  oh well...I think that I
have one in the basement.  I also have to replace some of the pushrod
tubes, the thermostat and bracket, and some other miscellaneous things
as the thermostat exploded and bent the bracket and some of the pushrod
tubes above it....WOW! I didn't think it would do that...

I went and got a main seal from one of my VW friends just outside of
town here in exchange for helping him spread some hay around his field
so it could dry.  Good trade.  He also let me borrow his press that
screws into the crankshaft and presses the seal in.  Bonus.  I will be
checking the end play on the motor also, but it should still be good as
this is a recent rebuild.

The more I look at the bus, the more I find neat little goodies.
Yesterday I found that I have a nice pedal pan and Hella H4 headlights.
(so thats why my lights are so bright!  I wondered...)

The heat works great too!  Stock heating system...still has the wrap
around the center heater tube underneath the bus....

Well, I'm off to borrow a flywheel lock and some other random bits....

Have a good day everyone, and I hope to be reporting more later
tonight.....if anyone cares to listen ;-)
