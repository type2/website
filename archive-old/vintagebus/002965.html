I remember reading on the RAMVA newsgroup a while back that someone  was
doing a tv show that shows how to install a vortec(i think) V-6 into a
bus(can't remember if splitty, bay..). I know the show was supposed to air
in January and I believe it was a 9 hour job. That is something you might
want to look at if you are considering that route. Hope this helps!

Subject: [VB] what to power my splitty with.


&gt; I am curious as to what would be the best option to power my splitty with.
I
&gt; haven't bought it yet, but the one I am getting has no engine and is a 62,
I
&gt; think. I Thought may be one of those fancy bored and stroked crate motors
&gt; you see in the VW magazines with the fancy Porsche fan. I am curious about
&gt; other options too.  I do have a little 2.8 liter GM v6in my back yard. I
&gt; have seen a bay window with a Toyota in it and I have seen a pic of a
Subaru
&gt; engine in one. Any advice?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
