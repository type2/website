Subject: Westy Flip Seat wanted/Questions

Howdy all. I'm looking for one of the early Westfalia front seats that
flips around so it can face the rear of the vehicle. I know they were
used in 1962, but not sure of other years. 
I am intending to put this into my 67 Walkthrough panel camper, which
has already been camperized beyond purity many years ago. My friend has
a 62 Westy with a flip seat, and it looks like they took a walkthrough
bus, and cut out the seat backs for the seat. Anyone know of any other
reinforcement? I can't seem to see any. 
Anyway, if anyone has a seat and mounting hardware, please let me know.
I don't care how the upholstery is, as long as all the hardware is
there. I'm in NC, so closer would be nice.
thanks,
--
