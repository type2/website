&gt; You can pull the distributor drive and turn it 90 degrees to accomodate
the
&gt; vacuum can. Muir suggests a method using a pencil that worked for me.
Don't
&gt; just jump into this though, read the manuals carefully and know what you
are
&gt; doing.
&gt; While I don't and haven't run a dual vacuum dizzy (vacuum advance and
&gt; retard), I have heard negative things about them. I think they were one of
&gt; those things VW did for smog control, not performance. Got to make up your
&gt; own mind on that one.

Chances are higher that the dizzy drive was
turned to accomodate the 009, and you
should now put it BACK by following the
orientation procedure in the Muir.
You can also run the dual vacuum distributor
with the retard unplugged.
