Subject: Gas cap problem.  Help!
Message-Id: &lt;199905101418581_at_rustybus.ireland_dot_com&gt;

I need help with a bit of a problem that have plauged me for a while and has been bugging me more lately.  Every time I make a left turn gas pours out of the filler cap on my tank.  I once tried to fix this by replacing the cap seal, and this works for a while.  A while was like 1/2 hour and then I would &quot;run out of gas&quot;, even with a full tank.  Of course you couldn't put more gas in for two reasons, the tank was already full and the gas cap wouldn't come off.  The problem was the tank was now air tight and was forming a vacuum that was holding the gas in and the cap on.  I went back to the old cap.

My question:  What do I need to do to let air into my tank without letting gas out of my tank through the gas cap?

Thanks,
Richard (loosing brain cells by the millions to gas fumes) K.
