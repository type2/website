Subject: Continental tires

When I was at Solvang, I saw some cool Continental tires.  Someone (from
SVII's I think) with a nice pearl white high roof had them on their bus
as did the fluorescent red bay window double cab rescue truck.  The
tires have an aggressive lugged outer edge to them.  I'm not sure if
they were 14&quot; or 15&quot;, although I suspect these I saw were 14's.  They
look good on a &quot;work&quot; vehicle, and would look great on my truck.

I didn't remember to get the # or size on them so I'm asking here if
anyone knows what they might be.  That, or a possible distributor in
L.A. would be great.

Thanks!

Steve
