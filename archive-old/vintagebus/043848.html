Subject: VWOA show in michigan

Well,

I dont think boycotting the show is the best idea.  To me, the best idea
is to organize everyone to:

a) go dressed discreetly
b) after they have taken your money put on your VWOA sucks t-shirt and
ballcap
c) hand out fliers about why VWOA sucks (maybe do this on the down low.)
d) shoe polish VWOA sucks all over your award winning classic (on the
windows if you are worried about the paint) Might even be fun to put it on
there AFTER you win the #1 prize for best use of original VW lint.
e) make sure the press are around when the whole lot of you gets the boot!

Its probably not any more effective than a boycott, but a heck of a lot
more fun.

take care,

Steve
