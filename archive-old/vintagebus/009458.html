Thom wrote &quot; On to POR-15; yes, you can paint over it, but you need to lay down a light coat of primer when the POR-15 is still tacky, to give the top coat something to stick to.&quot;

According to the Por-15 website there is no need for primer.  They have pretty good directions on www.por15_dot_com 

I just tried this product this weekend and loved it!!!  Wish I did it sooner.  I Por-15ed the cargo floor and front bumper.  I have painted over the front bumper already and have found it to accept the finish paint very well.  I tried to scrap it off and it holds BETTER to Por-15 than on regular metal primer.

The thing to watch for on this Por-15 is too keep it off yourself (I am wearing some Por-15 right now) and plan on throwing away any brush or spray can you use.  I could not get this stuff to move with mineral spirits or carb cleaner!

Good luck, this stuff is great!!!  I am planning on getting another pint this week!  

Does anyone know of a local retailer that carries this stuff cheaper than the Por-15 website?  Thanks.
