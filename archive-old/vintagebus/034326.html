Hi Brian,
Just a guess, but it sounds like you have too big of main jet which runs the
engine too rich at low to mid RPMs, and at the same time you are running too
big of air correction jet allowing too much air into the fuel system from mid
to high RPM.  Also it sounds like you distributor advance system is not
working or limited for some reason.  Set the distributor for 0 degreees
staticly and then see where the timing ends up at 2,500 RPM.  If it does not
reach at least 20 degrees BTC then there is somnething wrong with the
distributor advance, and must be fixed or replaced.   Eric&amp;Barb
