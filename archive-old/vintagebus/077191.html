Subject: re: [VB] Westy outside Electric plug?

When I was restoring~ or refurbing to the extreme, my 1967 Westfalia I was able
to locate an exact replacement for the old crummy electric plug. Prior to
finding it I was considering what it would take to make it look nice.
Fortunately, a brand new one cost me less than ten to twenty dollars. I'm
thinking about $7.00- $9.00.

I found mine at an RV supplier on NW Grand Aveune in Phoenix, AZ. The exact
details were given to the buyer of that Westfalia. I will attempt to locate him
and procur the info.
