Hey John,
        IMHO,I would save up the cash and buy a brand new exhaust.You don't
want to have to do this job over again in a short peiod of time.Also a
leakfree, quality exhaust is one of the most important elements in a good
running motor.You've already spent the big bucks, why stop now?( eat beans
for a week?)
        I just changed the entire exhaust system in my '64 bus last week.I
purchased the Phoenix exhaust from Kymco(header and muffler).I had them
ceramic coat it for me and I must say,it sounds and looks great, and the
coating seems impervious.Though fitting the header was the usual Grind!    I
also changed the heater boxes .
    But, you could spend only about 110 bucks for a decent exhaust. The
ceramic coated exhaust I just bought was $170.The heater boxes, $200.
        Oh yeah, I did have to cut my bumper slightly to fit the muffler.
(but it is a  brazilian bumper.)However, it did not interfere with rear
pulley tin or apron!
                    Good Luck !!

                                        woody
                               &quot; keep on pushin'&quot;

Subject: [VB] re: heat riser tubes


&gt; , i decided to splurge and
&gt; buy a brand new engine. Cool thing was  a few years ago, someone
&gt; mysteriously dropped off a pancake in my driveway with all the tin and
fuel
&gt; injection stuff, and i got a good discount for the 2 cores.  The uncool
&gt; thing was that all of a sudden my $600 seal order, $400 spindles and $1100
&gt; engine are all ready at the same time, ouch. Well anyway its worth it, but
i
&gt; had planned to replace the muffler before the engine, and the heater
boxes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;  Anyway the extractor bolt holes dont match up with the dualport intake
&gt; manifold at the heat riser tubes, so icant bolt it together, im wondering
if
can &quot;afford&quot;  the real deal muffler???????
&gt; any comments/warnings  would be appreciated, i really dont want to cause
any
&gt; damage to my new engine
&gt;
