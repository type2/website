&gt;&gt;  personalized plates ARE swappable but you are supposed to go to dmv to do it

&gt; hmm, I guess it depends what state you are in, because in California I don't  believe that was legal.

In California, personal plates belong to you. But you have to pay a 'retention fee' to hold on to them if you
do not immediately transfer them to another vehicle. Here is the paragraph from
http://www.dmv_dot_ca_dot_gov/vr/vr_info.htm#BM2517

Retention Fees
Environmental and Special Interest License Plate owners are required to pay an annual fee to retain their
personalized configuration when the plates are removed from the vehicle for future use, or when the vehicle is
placed onto the planned non-operation status. If the retention fee is not paid prior to the registration
expiration date, priority to the personalized configuration will be forfeited. Retention fees can be found on
the backside of the Special Interest License Plate Application, (REG 17).
