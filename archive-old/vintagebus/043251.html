The local dealer is giving away their &quot;Historical Volkswagen Vehicles Year
2000 Calendar&quot;.  But I gues my request for a dozen of them took them by
surprise.  (really???) Next thing I know, they say they actually are
costing $1.  Still for this calendar that's cheap.
For those of you who haven't seen it/picked it up....best do it soon I
would think.  
In addition to the full page color glossies at the top of each month, at
the bottom of the calendar for each month are a few notes of interest re:
historical vw memorabilia.
There are Busses, Bugs and Ghias' represented.
The newest model shown is a '64 Bus.  A '52 23 window sunroof deluxe Bus
being the oldest shown.  (and boy is that a beauty! and with safaris and
semaphores to boot).
Anyway....gotta go now and finish drooling over these photos.  Not
actually ON the photos tho  :)
Hope everybody gets theirs!
later
