Sorry all,

        I know it is not Friday, but I cant handle this any
longer..........

        IS IT SOME BIG MYSTERY where everyone lives?  It drives me nuts.  I
HAVE tons of parts.  I KNOW people who have tons of parts, and I am always
interested in more.   Furthermore, I would gladly lend my weekend to a
fellow V-dubber in need but if you dont leave  W-H-E-R-E in the heck you
live, I, and I am sure I am not alone, cant help you.
