Hi list,

Roofing tar has been suggested as an anti corrosion coating on the list. If
the stuff were applied behind the panels in a thick enough coat would it
have any sound/vibration dampling qualities?

If this stuff has potential it would be nice cos it can be remoced with heat
and solvent.

Some of the insulating material that I have seen in wrecked luxury cars
appears to have a tar like consistency and this got me thinking.

Any other hints would be appreciated.

Michael
