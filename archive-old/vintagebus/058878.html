Subject: Duralube/215,000 miles

   I have never heard anything good of Duralube till today. I just had a
customer walk in with a 1978 Transporter that he got from his father. He was
in buying the basic tune-up parts, ie plugs and an air filter. He was just
on his way out to change his oil and told me that the bus had always had
Duralube added at every oil change, 215,000 original miles on a Desert bus,
I guess it must work or are type 4 engines really THAT good, especially in
our heat.

ronnie  very interesting
