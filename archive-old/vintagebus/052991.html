Subject: Trade for Bus heater



OK Guys,
Let me start off by apologizing for this marginal content. &quot;I'm sorry for this marginal content&quot;. There.  Now,I probably should have waited til Friday but, anyway here goes.  It's starting to get cold in Ohio and I really need a gas heater for my 71 Westy.  I now have 3 vehicles I'm paying insurance on , My 71 Westy, an 83.5 water cooled Vanagon which I only keep for the GOOD HEATER, and an old Chevy work truck which I never use anymore.  So, in the interest of streamlining, If I can get a gas heater for my 71 then it can be my ALWAYS driver and I can get rid of everything else.  Blah, Blah, blah, so to get to the point I want to trade the 1986 Chevy Custom Deluxe pick up truck for a COMPLETE WORKING, GOOD CONDITION gas heater for my bus. The truck has a 350 engine with 160K miles on it and it runs GREAT! Not the prettiest to look at, but not too bad either.  It has a beefed up suspension for heavy hauling and towing.  It would be the perfect truck to trailer your show winner !
or to carry a BUNCH of parts around. Its a good solid truck, If I were selling it, I wouldn't take a penny less than $1000 so it would be great deal for a heater.  I will also consider ANY OTHER VW trades you may want to offer, don't be shy.  I am about 20 miles north of Cincinnati, Ohio.  Let's make a deal!!



Peace, John Baker
1971 Westy
1983 H20 Vanagon Westfakia
