Being I have never driven a bus with a middle seat or paid any attention to
how many clamps holds it in can anybody enlighten me.

I have a pile of clamps, base plates and T bolts but I don't know how many
and what parts to use.

short or long t bolts, with or with-out the nipple, 2 or seat base plates if
any at all, etc. etc., 

TIA   ronnie &quot;love those commercial buses and trucks&quot;
