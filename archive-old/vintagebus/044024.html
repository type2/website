The saga is at end, or nearly so.
By far Texans ordered big...but I guess that's common knowledge.
Must be lots of info hungry types out there!  (or just very smart :)
Anyway...for those who have sent payments within the past few days...there
are still 15 to 18 copies of the manual left so don't get worried.  All
orders will be filled....
But this announcement is to let you all know that these are the last to go
and I will sell till they are gone and make an announcement in a couple of
days to verify their end!
Thanks to all who followed thru with their committment to get one or both
manuals that I had printed up.
It has gone pretty well, for the most part.
Seems as tho a couple of manuals have been delivered in beat up and
tattered condition...one copy ended up missing some pages (I was wondering
where those extra pages had come from???)  Well, those have been mailed
out and if copies end up torn and or damaged...let me know, we can work it
out.
I will take reservations on remaining copies and hold for a few days
only...
later
