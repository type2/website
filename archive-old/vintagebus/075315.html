Subject: Tail lights

Hello list,
Just noticed a problem with my 67 Sundial.

Neither tail lights work.  I recently put new og tail light housings in both
sides, new grounds on both sides etc.  In addition, my license light is not
working either.  This is happening in spite of the fact that my turn signal
and stop lights work.

Any suggestions on where I should look?  I have replaced all of the fuses.
There is some confusion/speculation by me about one of the plugs into the
back of my light switch on my dash.  My son's 66 bus has two wires going
into one of the plugs, I seem to only have one.  Could a wire have become
disconnected from this push-on/in plug?

TIA
Ed
