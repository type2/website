Well a 41 or 42mm socket was nowhere to be found. Locally anyway.
Miraculously I found a 3/4&quot; drive set which I mentioned previously. It
was at a little hole-in-the-wall used tool shop inside a flea market. I
paid 59.50 tax-out the door for 16 sockets (7/8 - 2&quot;) a 1/2&quot; to 3/4&quot;
adapter, two extensions, a breaker bar and a ratchet all in a big 'ol
metal case. Brand new. I may never use it again but I thought that
considering Snap-on wanted $55 for just one socket with an adapter, I
came out pretty far ahead. I didn't realize that once you've gained
access to the 42mm nut by unbolting it from the spring plate, there
isn't anything securing the axle tube from twisting all around when you
try and muscle it off. I had to put a bolt through the spring plate into
a misaligned hole in the reduction box along with wrapping a chain
around the torsion tube and the lower section of the reduction box in
order to keep it in place while I worked on freeing up the nut. This nut
had seen Muir's field fix involving the hammer and chisel so I had to
hammer the socket on as well.
Well anyway, I've just returned from gathering new bearings and seals
for the reduction box so hopefully in a few hours I'll be back to report
that it went back together smoothly. I'm gonna toss on some new rear
brakes while I'm back there so I've got the next few hours booked. Stay
tuned. Till then...
