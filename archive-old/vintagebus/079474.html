&gt;&gt; I checked the main jet and it seems to be stamped 129.
The air correction jet is illegible.
Not quite sure about an emulsion tube, as nothing in my diagram was labeled 
as such.&lt;&lt;
Hi,
You really need a carb jetting gauge to find out what sized jets you have!  
Any old jets could have been worn bigger by the thousands of gallons passing 
through them or the DPO who thought he could get a huge HP increase by drilling 
out the jet/s to who knows what size.  Additionally we have often found brand 
new jets to be off a couple of sizes from the stamped number on them!
  As for the emulsion tube it is the tube part with the holes in it of the 
air correction jet.
  BTW when you assembled the engine did you make sure the fuel pump rod did 
not go higher than 13 mm at its highest point?  If it does go above this point 
the pump puts out too much fuel pressure and the carb shut off float is shoved 
down by the shut off valve from the over pressure and fuel pours through the 
carb and down the intake.
