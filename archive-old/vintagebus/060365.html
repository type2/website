&gt; Hmm... ok, well, the tranny works just fine, goes into all the gears and
&gt; such but it leaks like a m.f.  Will he need special tools to fix that?

Spend a couple of dollars at the car wash to
remove as much gunk as possible, then drive
the bus and warm up the gear oil. Place a large
sheet of cardboard under the bus overnight.
The leaks should be fairly obvious.
This will save the tech a lot of time ( and $ ).
