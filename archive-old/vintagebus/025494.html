Subject: First Trip Report
Message-ID: &lt;375D5633.F1BB56C8_at_essex1_dot_com&gt;

My first adventure with my '66 camper is over and I'm proud to report
that it was an unqualified success. My son Riley, the bus (Osterbus) and
I made a 450 mile round trip from our house to Camp Crusty and back with
no problems and only compliments to our new friends in the Der
Busbesitzer Gruppe. We are proudly sporting our new &quot;DBG&quot; sticker in the
back window, which I put on ass-backwards in spite of Matt Soiney's
patient instructions, and still drooling over the stash of VW's, parts
and tools at &quot;Connie's&quot;.
There's nothing quite as cool as seeing a line of buses stretching out
in front as we cruise through the countryside. I am moving new seats up
the priority list from &quot;get to them someday&quot; to &quot;next&quot; before we head
off to another weekend.
Thanks to everybody for making us feel so welcome. We look forward to
many more get-togethers. Now if I could just get &quot;Elvira&quot; out of my
head...
-John, Riley and Osterbus
