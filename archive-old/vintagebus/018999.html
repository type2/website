Subject: Ebay SO44 Westy has new photos...

I noticed that the '67 SO44 Westfalia that was
discussed earlier this week, Item #541703694, has a
bunch of new photos. Looks like the seller noticed my
comments as well. &lt;embarrassing&gt;  

I have no idea what the reserve is but keep in mind
that it cost me $14,500 to do the restoration on my
'67 SO42 (1993-1996 prices) and I still could have
secretly picked it apart for mistakes when it was
fresh. Have more in it than that now... AND it's not
OG like this one~ or as fresh. Plus this is a European
44 kit not a 42.

Out of all of the years that I have been dealing with
buses this one is as factory fresh as I personally
have seen. There is another friend in Grants Pass, OR
that had one in HotVWs as a super low milage ultra
rare  camper find that may have been equal to or
better. Haven't ever seen that one in person.

I know of *very* few camper buses that come close to
this level of OG. Included are the Grants Pass bus,
The 1HIPBUS and 2HIPBUS SO42 campers, an early one in
a garage in OCTO land and this ebay find. What's that?
Five buses of this category/in this league world wide?
Understand that I intentionally prefer not to mention
the owners names of these buses for security reasons.
If you are in the know then be cool for the same
reason.
Thought I'd pass the info along...
