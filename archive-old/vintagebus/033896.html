&gt;I drove my '66 (6 volt) Westy to the store last night, after dark,
&gt;everything worked fine... came out with a bag of groceries, started the
&gt;bus, and ...no headlights, everything else works, taillights, parking
&gt;lights, turn signals, dash lights etc.. but no headlights...they worked
&gt;on the way over...what gives? Any ideas?

Try changing your headlight switch, it worked for me on my 66 deluxe.
