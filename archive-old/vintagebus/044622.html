&gt; I thought Dan Howard decided his bus was a post March 1957 bus?????
&gt;  Whats he looking for a pre-march decklid for?
&gt;  

Actually what the plan is right now is to aquire the parts i want ie. bl 
decklid and then make the decision later as to what to put on.  I like the 
idea of the brakelight on there though.  I may decide to run with the early 
57 stuff as I have all of it, even the wiring and such is in there.  But you 
never know.  I do want to run stock but im just confused right now =) I would 
just end up taking the lid and having it straightened if needed and painted 
to match.  Thats all.  If I dont decide to use it, it would be back 4 sale on 
the list for cheep.  NOT TRYING TO BE A HORDE! ;)
