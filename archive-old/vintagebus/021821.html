&gt; The book says &quot;Makers: Caravan conversion by Lisburne Garage, 
&gt; Babbacombe Road, Torquay, Devon&quot;  

I did have a Bay-window Devon, and the company still does conversions though
it sold out and was bought up by a company in the North-west I believe.

This page tells the story of a '98 Bay being converted by them:

&gt; It also says that it was distributed in London by Stratstone 
&gt; Ltd. at 40 Berkeley St., London

Ha ha! Stratstone have now gone up-market - they now deal with the likes of
Rolls Royce, Bentley, Aston Martin and Ferrari.
