I am really sorry the earlier post little did i know it was a 20000$ show 
winner bus. Also the six dozen mods just doesn't and i don't beleave a nos 
interior looks like that and the paint is a 6500$ what a outrageous bus  
this is when restoring one of these looks reasonable

Sorry for sorta spamming the list with junk for millonares
Sincerly Kirin Jacobsen
