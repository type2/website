&lt;&lt;  I took the wheeles off in the front and the bolts are on so tight, how or
what do you use to brace the drums so they dont move while you screw the bolts
off. &gt;&gt;
Hi Mark,
Are you saying that you took the front wheels and drums off as a unit and now
can not remove the lugbolts?  If so then best thing to do is to remount the
drum/wheel assemblies back on your bus.  Lower the bus back onto the ground,
block the rear wheels and engage the E-brake.  Then use a least a 1/2&quot; drive
rachet wrench or breaker bar and matching 17mm socket.  You might also have to
use a breaker bar to improve your torque.  Eric &amp; Barb
