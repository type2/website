I am not saying the doghouse isn't better, it is, but the upright is also
functional. 
  I had a bus with the upright oil cooler and I drove it around for 3 years,
cross country and back, over the santa cruz mountains regularly, up and down
the coast, it was my daily driver,  (in addition to my mountain bike which I
used around town, not for 40 miles drives.)

I regularly tuned it up, and took care of it, and it started like a champ and
got 30mpg and plenty of perkiness,  had an H case motor which had uneven
compression when I got it but when I rebuildt the top end 3 years later  none
of the studs pulled out.   I never got it too hot.    the motor went into a
bug and later when I heard the bug tears came to my eyes, it was an emotional
moment.  I wish I still had it.  

Clara
