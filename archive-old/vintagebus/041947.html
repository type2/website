&gt; Hey Volks
&gt; 
&gt; All my driving buses seem to have a propensity to attract odds and ends to
&gt; gather on the dash by way of decoration. Since it's Friday here and we
&gt; haven't had a list
&gt; questionnaire for a while, here goes:
&gt; 
&gt; What do you have decorating your dash?

amateur Radio repeater guide
various coax cable jumpers
Transmitter hunting attenuator
ballot stubs
Beer mats from Prescott AZ
envelope containing lock &quot;pins&quot; from previous lock rekeying
Idaho Dept of Tourism questionaire
California map
dust
GPS unit
