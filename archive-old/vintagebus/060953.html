Subject: re:fresh air vent cover goo

i used plumbers putty, available at any decent hardware store-i got mine =
at
True Value.

best to get a clump out, and work it in your hands to warm it up and make=
 it
more pliable, alsot to form it into a &quot;rope&quot;

have not had any leaks there since i replaced it.

maybe else where, but not there.....actually i used it all the way around=
 i
beleive, not just at the bottom, but it was a couple years ago so i could=
 be
mistaken.
