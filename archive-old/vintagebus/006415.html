Fellow Listees -

Since I have been trying for the last few hours to get to type2_dot_com for the
archives and been unsuccessful, I will ask you all directly.  I have
completely dismantled the rear brakes on my 66, and was wondering since I
had everything apart, if I should r&amp;r the reduction boxes.  I plan to get
some major transmission work do in the next few weeks, but that should not
affect the workings of the redux boxes, should it?  I plan on keeping them,
but I want them to be prepared for the high speeds (60-65 mph) at which I
will be travelling.  Essentially, I was going to replace the metal brake
tubes, but the discovered that the cylinders were not functioning, so I
removed the drums to take care of the cylinders.  When I got the drums off,
I discovered that the emergency brake cables were not connected properly, so
I decides to fix that problem as well.  Now that I have gotten so far as to
take the backing plates off to get them sandblasted and recoated (power
coated? or zinc coated? or POR15?), I thought why not go the whole way and
take care of the rb's too!

&quot;Honey, I'm going in to the garage for an hour or so...&quot;
4:30 pm
&quot;Well, I guess we're not taking the truck to the show this weekend, I need
to do a little more work than I thought...&quot;

However, I'm not too sure what I should do when I get them apart.  Replace
bearings?  Is there some kind of seal on them or do they get sealed up with
grease or something else?  I just want to be prepared with parts when I
start doing this.  Thanks for all the help you all have given.  It seems
like just before I post a question, someone has already offered a solution!
