     All this talk of bearings brings up a question I've had for a month or 
     so.  I have recently received two different catalogs showing a strange 
     looking tool for greasing bearings.  I t fits onto your grease gun and 
     is advertised to evenly force grease into the bearing.  Anyone try 
     this and know it to work?  I truly enjoy the old method and have never 
     had any problems with it but can't resist a new tool if it really 
     works.
     
     Also, I've rebuilt the redux boxes on Lea's '63 and my '66.  They are 
     VERY different assemblies but one thing was the same - they both had 
     cheapo bearings that the cages came apart on and the balls were 
     crushed in the gears ending up like a clump of anti-seize laying at 
     the bottom of the box.  Do yourself a big favor and get quality 
     bearings.  This is not a job you want to do over again!  A clamshell 
     puller will greatly aid in pulling the outboard bearing.  They are so 
     close together that you can't get a conventional puller in between 
     them and large prybars are a sloppy way to do this.
