No, it's not another Fitzpatrick site. www.thomasregister_dot_com lists U.S. and Canadian manufacturers and their products. And their catalogs, and their CAD drawings.Search by part name, manufacturer or brand name. It's a new service and was featured in Netsurfer's Digest, so it may be slow or a bit clumsy at first. 
Free, but you have to register to get an ID and password. No confirmation e-mail is needed. Some of you may have the tree-killing version of this on your shelf.
