If you have the one with the extra piece on top, that is bay window, and much 
harder to fin than one for a bug/split   The bay windows only came with them 
in 71 I think

..........................


i have one here that looks like the split bus/beetle one with an extra

section on top that make it square off so its the same height all the way

across, does anybody know what vehicle that goes on?


BTW valve cover gaskets work really well to seal off the doghouse outlet,

cut to fit and glued on ,

&gt; The roundy one.

&gt;

&gt; &gt; Do splittys use the piece that

&gt; &gt; is rounded on the top, or does it kinda flatten at the top?
