Seems like a good time to ask: Does anyone have any
opinions/experiences (good or bad) with the rebuilt
longblocks advertised in the rags?

I put a GEX 1700 longblock in my dad's Westy loaf
about ten years ago, but we sold it shortly thereafter
(didn't know what I had). So, I don't know wether
they're any good.

Who has the best/most reliable longblocks or turnkeys
out there? Anyone? Buehler..Buehler...
