Got back from Pomona last night, kind of a crappy turnout, apparently that's
normal for the January meet because of rain, etc.?  Oh well, I actually
found some parts for my '55 Bus for reasonable prices, which is more
important anyway.  There seemed to be a shortage of crank-start handles this
time, I must have dried up the stockpiles last time buying them all.  ;)

I was lucky enough to line up some excursions to people's houses on both
Saturday afternoon on the way out and Sunday afternoon on the way back where
I was able to purchase some 36hp stuff for dirt cheap.  The Sunday pm guy
was a interesting ex-Vietnam vet, he was wearing fatigues and kept talking
about his &quot;property out in the desert&quot;.  He said he learned to drive on his
friend's '54 Bus.  Of course, I had to ask if he knew where the Bus was now
but his friend wrecked it soon after.  Damn.

He didn't have much so we took a drive over to his friend's house.  Oh man,
this guy needed to do some yard cleanup, parts everywhere just laying in the
sand, most of which were modified in some way for off-roading.  And most of
it was late 60s Bug.  This place and these 2 ex-Vietnam buddy-looking guys
made for the exact situation that would scare the crap out of my wife.  And
I kept that in mind as he said &quot;all the 36hp stuff is in that building over
there&quot;.  You know, the dark building over there, hidden from the street,
where we keep the bodies...

He claimed to have &quot;a lot&quot; of 36hp stuff but then could only find 1 cut-up
fan shroud and a plug wire tube.  He had 6 dogs in his yard, all chained at
strategic locations to guard different piles. Judging by the piles of dung
around each one, I'm not sure they were ever unchained.  He told me to feel
free to look around the rest of his yard but &quot;let me go move that dog in the
back somewhere else, he's the only one that'll attack you&quot;.  Yeah, ok,
meanwhile the other 5 are strangling themselves to death, slowly pulling
their weighted-down doghouses across the sand to get at me.  But everything
came out alright, although I didn't buy much, and I continued home, alive,
to Phoenix.
