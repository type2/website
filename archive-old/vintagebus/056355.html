Subject: Re: Tank size - 10 Gallon?

It is one of those vintage-hack Binz crew cabs - single cab with a rear
seat, no treasure chest door, and has some extra Binz bracing added.  Don't
think it is similar enough to a regular crew cab in the underseat area to
get a good idea.  Sorry.

&gt; What does the panel that seperates the tank from the
&gt; treasure chest look like? If it's the same as a DC this
&gt; would anser my question about a bay tank fitting in a DC.
