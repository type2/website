Hi Thomas,
We think you mean from in front of the pulley!

&lt;&lt; I had driving with '74 air cooled bus with standard engine 1.6 L . &gt;&gt;
      Just a guess, but are you driving the upright non-type 4 engine?  Is 
this a new problem?  If so you need to check the breather hose from the oil 
filler to the air cleaner for mayonase looking stuff made out of a mixture of 
oil and water condensation.  This will be a big problem if you do not have 
the thermostic flaps/bellow system in place and/or if you do drives shorter 
than 20ish minutes.  If so, especially due to the latter cause then change 
oil at least every 3 months or 1,000 miles.
  If this problem is not new or happens in warm weather it is most likely 
that your engine is either new and not sealing yet around the P&amp;Cs or old and 
worn out there.
