Subject: Art car email list (Friday topic)

This was in today's PC World Online's Email list of the Day:
        
ARTCAR NEWS DISCUSSION

Have you ever seen a car covered with toys or quarters, or shaped like a giant 
shark or flamingo? Perhaps someone in your community has transformed his or 
her car into a strange looking spaceship or decorated it with glass mirrors, 
spoons, lightbulbs, or broken dishes.  These are called &quot;artcars,&quot; and many 
people are creating them--perhaps in reaction to the overwhelming &quot;sameness&quot; 
of so many cars on the road today.

I have my own artcar (blue, green and crystal glass and other things) and it's 
a lot of fun to drive around town. I can't wait until I attach the lights. 
People smile and wave and often ask me about it.  If you decide to do one 
yourself, check out the discussion list associated with artcars. This is the 
place to talk to owners about their experiments with glue and other bonding 
agents, upcoming events, and whatever else is on their minds. This can be a 
really wild group.

My solution to the overwhelming &quot;sameness&quot; is to drive my bug, and some fine 
day, my bus.  Ironic that VW's used to be so common, yet now people smile &amp; 
wave to us.

Have a great weekend!
