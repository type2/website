Subject: Re: [VB] Excessively stiff clutch pedal

Ok just looked at the Bentley and it says that if the Bowden tube is
excessively bent then it will cause a stiff pedal.

I replaced the Bowden tube, however I remember having two of them - so maybe I
used the wrong one - I'll try and get a new one and try that as well as
replacing the cross shaft bushes whilst I am there.

  &quot;stock&quot; is vague... does it have the circles or lots of thin arms?

  I'd think about your bowden tube.  seem to remember the bend of thebowden
tube affects the firmness of the clutch pedal.   it's in the bentley.
