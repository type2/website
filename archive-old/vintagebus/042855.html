Me and my buddy Forrest towed the ol' beast home Sunday afternoon with his
little Toyota pick-up.  To say the least it was very exciting!  When we
showed up at the farm where it had been sitting for the past 18 years or
so, the lady who lived there already had the tires pumped up and was
cleaning all the junk out of the inside.  That was definately cool!  We
spent about 2 hours trying to free up one of the brake drums (bummer!).
After that we proceeded down the two mile dirt road to get to Hwy 95.
Like I said, we were using my buddy's little Toyota truck with a nylon tow
strap and I had never towed like this before.  The only brakes on the bus
was the e-brake, and it didn't work all that great.  A couple scary
corners and we decided to pull over.  I tighened the e-brake cables and we
were on our way down Hwy 95.  We cooked down 95, getting up to 60 mph at
some points!
	Anyway...I started checking out the engine thoroughly today, and
found out that it was still full of oil!  I pulled the carb and the inside
of it was clean and shiney.  After 18 years I truely think that this
engine will live to power the old '65 again!
	I just have one question.  As some of you might know, this '65 is
a walk-through.  I want to get the m-codes copied down from behind the
front seat, but with the chance of sounding like an idiot, I have to ask
how the heck do you get to the back of the passenger seat?  I tried
folding it forward or taking it out, but no dice!  Sorry about sounding
like such an idiot, but I'm new to the whole running bus thing!  Thanks!
