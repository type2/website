thanks for the pic, that helps , i guess what im looking for really though ,
is a general consensus on what the vw owner would like to see in an
aftermarket tool roll for the daily driver, i mean that little 13/10 the
used to put in there isnt the greatest thing for valve adjustments, i like
an offset box end 13 myself, anyway im workin with a reputable toolman on
this, and we are trying to come up with a survival kit at a good price, any
suggestions anyone?

&gt; a little time and i found the correct picture, these are all the tools
that came
&gt; with early buses, later kits were missing the generator wrench
&gt;
&gt;
