We know what you meant to say, but then what else would it do?? ;-)



&gt; Traded for a used tranny that a friend said he
&gt; and his brother drove at 55 no problem!  Turned out that one did the early
&gt; stock 1960-63 47 MPH at 3,000 RPM and 55 at 3,800 RPM!  If you had a 4.125
&gt; R&amp;P with .82 fourth and late RGBs you should be able to do 55 MPH at 3,000
&gt; RPM.  So unless you have a freeway flier 3.875 R&amp;P .82 fourth with late RGB
&gt; which would get you 60 MPH at 3,000.......  s

I think some tire sizes would be relevant here also.  Are you running 205 / 15's
