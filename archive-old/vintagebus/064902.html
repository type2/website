Lube'm.

I'd love to hear a detailed explaination from builder two, though, as to
why he thinks that oiling the rings and cylinder walls before first-run
would cause the rings to wear out prematurely or to not seat.

Perhaps the only experiance he has with oiled rings is on engines that
were not given a proper breakin?
