Subject: Hippy bus FS in Phoenix
Message-ID: &lt;8cf61292.2447cbad_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

	Just got off the phone with a guy here in Phoenix who has a '61 he
wants to 'get rid of'.

	On the down side he describes is as having 'custom' wheels/tires (cut
fenders) and 'a little rust down low'.  It also needs a master cylinder (PO
bought one and left it sit in the bus since '95 and it's rusted now).

	On the up side he says it is 'straight as an arrow', the engine (1600
SP) runs, and it has a 3.88 tranny in it that has very few miles on it though
it was rebuilt in '95 by Bill Bowman (better known tranny builder in this
area).

	Further discussion led to the knowledge that all the windows are
sitting in the bus (was scheduled to be painted about 4 years ago), the bench
seat is 'springs only' and it has some sort of 'hippy-type' painting on the
sides of it.

	That' about all I got out of the conversation other than he doesn't
want it and will sell it at a 'very reasonable' price.  His name is Lee and
he can be reached at (602)569-6767.

	As a side note, he was telling me about some of the other vehicles he
has had, one of which was a VW powered rail called the &quot;Black Widow&quot; which
was featured on the cover of one of the rags quite a few years ago.  This was
along with several other non-VW cars that I remember from many years ago
including a red, white, and blue Rambler 'jet-car'!!!!

Anyway, if you are interested in this bus call him, not me.  I've already
told you all I know about it.

'61 DC
