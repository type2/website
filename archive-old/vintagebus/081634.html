Subject: New Goodies from Europe!

Got some new goodies coming the end of this week from Europe.  Some of these
accessories are particular highlights...


VW Bus Pattern Tableware AND Cutlery sets...
http://busdepot_dot_com/view.jsp?prodgroup=1089

The tableware sets were an instant sell-out last year. I finally have them
back, in both multicolor and blue patterns - but this year with silverware
sets to match (complete in their own storage pouch). Every bus owner needs a
set of these (or two, one for the patio and one for the bus. :-)


Side Tents with FLOORS!... http://busdepot_dot_com/busdepot/details/tents.jsp

Drum roll please .... I finally have side tents with actual FLOORS!  This is
the first time since the original Westy bus tent that a floored tent has
been available (the Europeans preferring side tents without floors for some
odd reason).  These new tents are also improved and redesigned in other
ways. I got a very small quantity so far and expect them to sell out
quickly, so order soon. Once they're gone, I expect to have more somewhere
around June. You'll find them, as well as our other models, at:


Bus Keychains and Fridge Magnets... Sold out instantly last time, now back
in stock.

Bus Mud Flaps... http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=J12265
These are like the ones that were once available that had VW emblems on
them, but sans the emblem. Use them plain or paint your own.  Nice quality.


Insulated Window Blanket Kits...
http://busdepot_dot_com/view.jsp?&amp;category=46&amp;prodgroup=944
Keep your Bus much warmer during cool-weather camping, and provide privacy.


Hot Start Relay Kits... http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=wr1
Having grown frustrated with the ever-increasing price of the Bosch WR1
relay kit, I decided to import Hella's version from Europe.


There's a lot more, throughout the website, but these are the most
universally-interesting ones.
