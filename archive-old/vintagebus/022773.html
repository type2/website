I've heard of it being done, and tried it once, but the amount of time
invested in dorking with removing all the stuff is greater than the time
required to remove the engine.

Just think of all the other cool things you can do while you're in there:

* check the engine mounts
* check the clutch
* look for any strange leaks from the tranny or engine
* replace the axle boots - easier with the engine out of the way
* fix those mis-functional heater boxes
