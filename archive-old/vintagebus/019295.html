Here is the response I got from Bentley.  It looks like we got their
attention, but we still need to show a larger support base.  As of this
writing we're at 126 entries.  (http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/bentley.html)

Thom,

I checked out your petition site for a pre-'63 Transporter manual and I am
impressed. Great job on taking some initiative here.

Let me tell you what I've got right now and what I think we would need in
terms of numbers to make this happen. Currently I have two original copies
of the May 1959-1962 factory transporter manual. Having two copies allows me
to verify them against each other to confirm that the one we reproduce will
have a good chance of having all the correct pages. I have nothing for early
(pre-1959) buses.

Based on the cost of doing previous vintage workshop manual reproductions, I
would estimate that if you came up with 350-400 individuals that would be
willing to pay a minimum of $109.95 for this manual we would see this as
something worth getting into our production schedule. Keep in mind that it
will only cover back to May of 1959 (1192cc; 36 SAE bhp and 40 SAE bhp
motors).

In order to cover the earlier buses I would need to find original workshop
manuals to reproduce from. I have yet to see one at the various VW shows I
attend throughout the U.S. and Germany. This would also be an entirely
separate product from the '59-'62 book.

That's what I can tell you for now. I think it is important for potential
customers to be aware of these details ('59-'62 coverage and minimum retail
price) when they are deciding if this is really something they would pay
for.

We look forward to hearing from you as your list grows and sincerely
appreciate your efforts to help make this happen.
