Subject: Re: [VB] loaf to split interior swap

The loaf interior is designed for a loaf obviously- it will not just =
&quot;slide in&quot; granted you won't need to bust out your grinder to make it fit, =
but you would have to do a fair amount of fiddling to make it fit. It =
boils down to how much of an autheticity freak you are and how much you =
mind trimming fiddling etc. on the original so-69 interior  (or your bus) =
to make it fit. Case in point the buklhead on a loaf is about 2&quot; taller =
meaning that if you try and retrofit a bay window coldbox into your split =
the cabinet will sit about 2&quot; higher than the back of the bulkhead. This =
will not impact its functionality but aesthetically leaves a lot to be =
desired.

Does anyone know how hard it would be to fit a split bus with the =
&quot;European&quot;
SO-69 Westfalia kit? Thanks for any help you can offer.
