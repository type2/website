Subject: Re: [VB] Friday question: Bentley typeface?

Hi Matt Roeberds and list!

This is Daisy Hutzell-Rodman, Jeremy W. Rodman's wife and desktop publisher extrordinairre.  (OK, that was an exaggeration, but I do edit and publish the Vintage Voice, newsletter of the Vintage Volkswagen Club of America.)

In looking at an old college textbook (old being about 5 years ago), the font, except for the chapter headings, looks extremely close to Gill Sans.  (Sans meaning without, in the case of typography, without caligraphic embelishments)  The g is wrong, but every other letter is correct.  It's definitely in this &quot;family&quot;.  As for type size, I would think 10 point type, which is standard publication point type, but it does look awfully small, so maybe 9 points, definitely no smaller than 8 points as this starts to become illegible.  

For the chapter headings and cover, you might try New Century Schoolbook, it's a little different, but pretty similar.  12 point type would be a good guess, but since it is a heading, it may be 14 point type.

I don't normally read this list (I have three volunteer positions, I belong to 4 clubs (3 VW), and I am taking a class.)  But my husband wanted me to expound my knowledge of typography on you.  I love answering questions like this.

Peace, Love, and Happiness,

Daisy
