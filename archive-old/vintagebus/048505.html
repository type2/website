Depending on brand (Eber. or SW), condition, type (for bug, bus, type 3,
thing), style (under dash or engine compartment) completeness (are all the
parts there?).  A good working bus heater with all the parts should be
worth $150-$400.  But if is for a bug, I wouldn't pay that much unless you
have a bug.

A Stewart Warner heater will have some interchangeable parts with all there
styles such as fuel pumps, injectors, spark plugs, blowers, etc. so finding
a couple SW heaters will land you some good parts.

I have picked up rebuildable SW at garage sales and swap meets for as
little as $5.  I pulled a complete Eber. BN4 from a '76 bus (which will fit
in a splitty) with all the ductwork for $40.  Most people are scared of the
gas heaters (which is unfounded, but works in our favor), so the prices are
low for what you are getting.


&gt;how much are the early(60's) gas heaters worth? a friend of mine has a
&gt;couple of them.
