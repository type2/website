Hi everyone, Was wondering if anybody might have the pole dimensions from a
1967 split westy childs cot? length,OD,width of the ends that slide into the
brackets, I have searched high and low for one and cannot locate this item.
I used to own one and foolishly sold it a few years back and now I could
kick myself. Any help would rock.I have the brackets.
