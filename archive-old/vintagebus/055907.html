Subject: Re: [VB] Speedometer broke-any spares?

Well, My speedo cable broke yesterday, so today I replaced it, and found the
speedometer locked up (resulting in the cable breaking).

So anyway, after I tore the speedo apart to try to fix it, I found out why I
don't do speedometer repair for a living.  I got the odometer fixed, but the
needle part isn't working anymore (it is now rubbing in the cylinder thing).
Dang.

So, does anyone here have an extra speedometer for sale so I can keep tabs
on how fast I'm driving?  Or does anyone know a place that sells refurbished
ones?

Thanks for any help!
