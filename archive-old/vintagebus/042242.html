&gt; &gt;Don't forget a cell phone as well, unless you're good with smoke signaling.
&gt; 
&gt; I think the original poster was contemplating a trip to Alaska, where
&gt; the cell coverage may be something less than continuous.  For that situation
&gt; I would suggest at least a CB radio and maybe a &quot;linear&quot; for it.  Yes,
&gt; before the hams flame me, I know that the 500-watts-for-$50 linears
&gt; really suck and splatter all over and so on.  What I mean is for the
&gt; linear to *only* be used in case of emergency.

Do you know that you can also be hit with a multi-thousand-dollar &quot;Notice
of apparent liability&quot; from the FCC if you are caught with said illegal
amplifier?  They are getting _very_ sticky about enforcing such things
these days with Riley Hollingsworth in charge.  It is also illegal to 
import such amplifiers into the US (remember, you will cross borders!) and
presumably Customs Canada won't be very happy to see it going north 
either. Also, the linear will not ensure that you will be able to
communicate or that the people you communicate with will be helpful, since
you can only transmit on one band and the people who will be listening
will be more interested in maintaining their schedules than in helping
&quot;some freak in a VW bus&quot;.

&gt; An even better solution
&gt; if you have the license for it would be an HF-band ham radio, where
&gt; you can (legally) talk further with lower power.

Not a bad idea, particularly when the Morse code requirement is only 5WPM.

However, one should remember that the Alaska Highway is rather
well-travelled.  You're unlikely to be stranded for long.  The biggest
challenge is finding parts for your relatively rare vehicle.  With
telephones and UPS you really needn't worry about being stuck for more
than a few days in any case.  I don't think that I'd be any more concerned
about parts there than I would be on US50 in Nevada.
 
&gt; Also, one way to acquire spares on the cheap is by regular maintenance.
&gt; If you change your fan belt before the old one is shot, the old one can
&gt; be your spare.  If your old spark plugs aren't totally trashed, clean
&gt; them up, re-gap, and put them in the spares box.  Etc.

I do it the other way around.  The spare parts go on the engine, and the
new parts replace the spares.  This keeps the spares fresh and prevents me
from having to do the same job twice.  If you do keep the old parts for
spares be sure to label them carefully.
