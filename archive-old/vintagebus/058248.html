Subject: FW: [VB] More on NOS round mirrors.  I need some help.

Matt, the best way to verify if you have an NOS mirror is to send it to me
and I'll take a look at it on
my bus...heh heh heh.  Seriously, I think there were a few different
suppliers of those round mirrors
so all original mirrors are not exactly alike.  I bought a sweet mirror last
year at the Octo meet, took it 
home to compare it to another mirror I had and they are definately
different, but I'm pretty sure they are both 
original.  This is just a theory of mine.  Anyone else have any input on
this?

&gt; Subject:	[VB] More on NOS round mirrors.  I need some help.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to all who have already helped.  I have been
&gt; looking over the 3 different types of mirrors i have
&gt; and wanted to do a compairison.  What i have is:
&gt; 
&gt; Reproduction mirror i bought from Ronnie that has the
&gt; correct markings on the back of the mirror
&gt; 
&gt; My OG mirror that is on my bus
&gt; 
&gt; A supposed NOS mirror that i am trying to validate.
&gt; 
&gt; What i would like help with is measuring a few parts
&gt; of the mirror.  I have noticed some distinct
&gt; differences between my OG mirror, NOS mirror and the
&gt; repro.  I know there are more then one repro unit
&gt; being made so i would like to get a few of you to
&gt; measure yours.  Both OG and repro.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  What is the width of the crimped part of the
&gt; mirror?  Not the OD, the thickness of the crimp that
&gt; holds the mirror in place.  (I think the OG/NOS ones
&gt; are thinner then the repros)
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  What is the diameter and height of the base of the
&gt; post.  Not where the number markings are but the base
&gt; of the actual post.  (I think the OG/NOS ones are
&gt; smaller in diameter and taller)
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  What is the diameter of the post just under the
&gt; ball portion of it.  The top of the tapered neck. 
&gt; (OG/NOS is smaller)
&gt; 
&gt; 4.  What is the size of the numbers stamped into the
&gt; back side?  (OG/NOS is larger)
&gt; 
&gt; Other observations i have made are that all 3 have a
&gt; very defined step where the mirror crimp transitions
&gt; to the domed back.  Also, the OG/NOS ones seam to have
&gt; the glass more firmly held in place as the Repro unit
&gt; seams to &quot;rattle&quot; when i shake it.
&gt; 
&gt; My OG unit has a high shine/polish to it.  I know it
&gt; has been polished though.  The NOS one i have is dull
&gt; and shows very slight grain marks from the aluminum
&gt; while the repro is very dull and looks clear coated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the help.  I think i do in fact have a NOS
&gt; mirror here but hope that thru this info i can confirm
&gt; that by finding that all the repro units out there
&gt; vary like mine does.
&gt;
