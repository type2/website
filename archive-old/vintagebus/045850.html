Subject: speaker box for a single cab
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have found a way to get great sound out of a split window single cab w/out 
cutting any holes it the cab. Interested? Let me know. Also fits in the 67 
and earlier bus KEEP THE ROOM AND GET GREAT SOUND!
I don't know if any one will like the idea but its cool. I've got two 12 inch 
woofers in my box now, I had 3 10 inches in the same box, but I like the way 
the 12's sound better!
