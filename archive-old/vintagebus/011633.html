Thanks for posting the address.  This is an interesting Web site containing
some useful information.  However, I have to take issue with some of their
statements regarding 6 volt vs. 12 volt starter motors.  I've made the
conversion from 6 to 12 volts several times on various vehicles.
                                      
&lt;acvwjyro_dot_com&gt; says:

&gt;&gt;   STARTER The 6 volt starter will work with 12 volts until you crank it
&gt;&gt;   for too long. Unlike the generator, the starter has no provision for
&gt;&gt;   cooling, and running the 6V starter with 12 volts results in twice the
&gt;&gt;   expected power dissipation (although it spins twice as fast). But this
&gt;&gt;   means heat. When you replace the starter with a 12V unit, you MUST ALSO

Yes, the 6 volt starter will work on a 12 volt car, but for a limited time 
only.  The problem is not so much getting hot from running too long, but rather 
that the higher voltage causes the motor to start spinning *before* the 
solenoid has engaged the starter drive gear teeth with the flywheel ring gear.

So, each time you start your car, a little bit of the flywheel teeth are worn
away.  (These teeth are softer than those on the starter gear.)  By and by,
perhaps after six months, the wear on the flywheel teeth is so great that the
engine will not turn over at all sometimes.

Typically the teeth on the flywheel become so badly worn in two places, 180 
degrees apart, near TDC and BDC, that you have to get out and turn the engine
over by hand using the generator pulley &amp; belt to have any hope of the starter
engaging the flywheel.  This is not fun in some weather conditions, nor when
you are trying to impress a date or significant other with your cool VW! 

&lt;acvwjyro_dot_com&gt; continues:

&gt;&gt;   means heat. When you replace the starter with a 12V unit, you MUST ALSO
&gt;&gt;   REPLACE THE FLYWHEEL. The 6V flywheel will work for a while (maybe)
&gt;&gt;   until that time when you have to get the pregnant wife to the hospital
&gt;&gt;   or get to court before 3:00.

The 6 volt flywheel will not work *at all* with a 12 volt starter.  The 6 and
12 volt flywheels are a different diameter, and have a different number of
teeth.  Off the top of my head I think that 6 volt is 109 teeth, and 12 volt is
130, but my memory might be off regarding the exact number. 
   
Anyway, the 12 volt flywheel is just enough bigger that it won't fit into the
bell housing of a 6 volt transaxle.  So, you either have to change to a '67
transaxle, or you have to enlarge the inside of the bell housing.  This is the
main reason why so many people try to get by using the 6 volt starter when
doing the conversion to 12 volt. 

Enlarging the bell housing is not that difficult, but it's tedious and requires 
tools that many VW owners don't usually have access to.  You need an air 
powered die grinder, a strong air compressor to run it, and some machinist's 
blueing.  I suppose you could use an electric Dremel tool, but I think it would 
take much longer, and I don't think they're designed for continuous use of this 
sort.

Carefully measure the distance that the flywheel extends past the front 
mounting flange of the crankcase with a depth gauge.  If you don't have a depth 
gauge, a carpenter's square would be okay.

This distance, plus a bit extra to be safe, is the depth to which the bell
housing will need to be enlarged.  Go all the way around the inside of the bell
housing with the die grinder, taking off a couple of mm or so, and then paint
the area you're working on with blueing.

After it dries, insert an engine w/ a 12 volt flywheel as far as you can, and
use a wrench on the crank pulley nut to rotate it a little bit.  Remove the
engine, and you can easily see bright shiny marks on the blueing, indicating 
where the flywheel is interfering with the bell housing.

Make another pass with your die grinder, and repeat the process until you have
established clearance all the way around, i.e. with the crankcase firmly bolted
to the transaxle, the crankshaft can be rotated 360 degrees without any
interference between the flywheel and the bell housing of the transaxle.

This is a _lot_ easier if you have an extra crankcase to use --- just install 
some main bearings and a crankshaft, and leave everything else off.  You can 
use a complete engine for your trial fits, but it requires much more effort
than just a crankcase w/ shaft &amp; flywheel.

Another item that the Web site overlooks is that the shaft of the 12 volt 
starter is smaller than the 6 volt, so you have to either make or buy a special 
bushing for the hole in the 6 volt transaxle bell housing where the starter
shaft fits.  I think that Bugpack and Gene Berg sell them, as do probably
several other outfits.  They're also fairly simple for a machinist to make.

&lt;acvwjyro_dot_com&gt; further opines:

&gt;&gt;   Kevin changed Flaming Moonbeam (66 II) BACK to 6 volts because he was
&gt;&gt;   having trouble starting the engine and you can always jump the 6 volt
&gt;&gt;   vehicle from a 12 volt battery. I personally like the 6 volt systems
&gt;&gt;   better than the 12 volt, and unless there is an over riding reason for
&gt;&gt;   changing to 12 volt, would recommend staying with 6.

IMO there are several reasons for making the switch.  One is that it's getting
harder all the time to find 6 volt bulbs in the average auto parts store, and
the selection of accessories such as tape players is astronomically greater for
12 volt systems.  Another is that in very cold weather, 12 volt systems start
more easily than 6 volt systems.  This is especially true if the contacts in
the ignition switch are worn, which is often the case on old VWs. 

Even with everything in tip-top shape, 12 volts will beat 6 volts every time
next February in Duluth.
