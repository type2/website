Rick:

When I read &quot;Extra parts include...1600DP not installed, condition unknown&quot;
it makes it sound like the engine being described is in addition to the bus
engine. I had to read the ad a couple of times and look at the photos before
I picked up on the fact that the bus had no engine installed.
Certainly if I was bidding to own the bus I wouldn't do so without
contacting you with a list of questions.
Once again, here's a case of &quot;shoot first, ask questions later,&quot; always a
bad idea.

&gt; hi guys and Clara,
&gt; I have a question for everyone.  Last week I had my bus on ebay that
&gt; sucessfully reached the reserve and the high bidder said that I
&gt; misrepresented my ad
&gt;
&gt;     my question for everyone is this.  After reading the ad  would you
&gt; assume that the bus is running?
&gt;
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Rick
