I heartily second that! With what I have in my Dcab I could have bought 2.
One in very good, and near original shape that came up a month or so after
the expensive work on mine was underway and another in just slightly worse
shape than mine was in before I began pouring money into it. 

I doubled my estimated budget before I started the job and still managed to
exceed that. I'm still quite a way from where I'd like to be and even if I
don't completely lose my mind and try to complete the resto accurately I
will easily end up spending three times my original estimate.
