in the last bus that I ever ran gauges in (62 swap panel) I checked out the
VDO gauges by switching senders and gauges to check consistency, using 2
different gauges and 3 different  senders of the same type, I got 3
different readings with over 20 degrees variance, Use Autometer if you want
accuracy or VDO pro series all there other gauges are Malaysia junk, good
for reference only. 

just another of my experiences

ps, also the gauge might be correct at 170 degrees but at 200 it could be
off up to 20 degrees. The 62 panel would read 170 around town then 270 on
the highway, 4 years later the engine is still running like a top (in a baja
now)

&gt;&gt;
Interestingly, the VDO  oil temp guage with the VW style face dated 5/57
goes from 30 to 120 C.
30C is 86F, so you can see it warm up :).
120 C is about 250F  That was the top of the guage made for VWs.
&gt;&gt;
It's my understanding that 250F is the oil temp redline for VWs, both air
and water-cooled.
