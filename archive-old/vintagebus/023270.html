I don't think it's a &quot;later&quot; thing, I think it's just a glass option thing.
 My '55 had thru-the-glass window, but my '56 had &quot;on top&quot; latches.  What
does this mean?  It means that you could use thru the glass stuff, save
your sanity, and would not have to worry about being incorrect.  

I remember someone saying those funky windows came about because of not
being able to drill that type of glass.

&gt;Please, I don't want to hear that I should just mellow out and put in
&gt;later slider glass.  I realize I'm screwed up, I don't need to be
&gt;reminded. :)~
