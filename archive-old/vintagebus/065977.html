Subject: Re: [VB] Ride Height - Minutes and Hours

When I was involved as a builder/driver in Formula Ford (mid '70s) we 
used bathroom scales to adjust basic spring settings in our car.  We 
placed a scale underneath each tire and adjusted the springs to where we 
thought things were right.  Where each side was even and the front/rear 
bias made some sense.  We looked at the numbers on the scales, how much 
weight was shown.  The mental image of a scale under each wheel of your 
bus might help you picture what the issue with adjusting the rear 
torsion bars is.  Each rear wheel has to show the same weight on the 
scale.   Uneven springing will cause bad handling and braking and you 
will not enjoy driving your bus.  This is a very important issue.
