Hey everyone - this is a really neat little book that is for sale on Ebay.
It's gonna bring several hundred bucks but the pictures that this guy
scanned in are worth looking at.  It shows all the old features of the first
buses - like the spare tire in the engine bay!  I saved all 4 pictures the
guy scanned in because they are all neat.  I think they'd be worthy enough
to put on www.vintagebus_dot_com!
