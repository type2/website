Subject: camping in my driveway

I live in Stillwater, OK, about 60 miles south of Ponca City. We have a
large driveway and backyard, so, if anyone needs a place to stop/camp
while traveling to Josh's funeral give me a call for directions. I'll be
leaving here late Friday morning to drive up there.
