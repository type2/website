woody, 

your bashing the guy without giving him a chance!  his article just
shows us what background he has with vw's, and although not very vast,
he does show his love of the car.  i think with him posting to ramva, he
shows that he is very interested in putting out a mag that the people
want (this much is obvious).  

instead of getting a small taste of it and going &quot;GOOD GOD, NO!!&quot;  see
how it goes for a few months.  if it does end up turning into a pile of
worthless papers, then, ok, you can say this guy isnt very good, but at
least give him a chance before you label him.  

and of course (unfortunatly) the vw mags are in fact going to have to
get in some more watercooled articles. thats where the interest is
shifting, and if they stayed devoted to only aircooled vw's, they would
probably sink.  sink or swim.  if they have to swim to stay alive, then
thats fine with me, i wont mind having to turn a couple of pages past a
water pumper, its not that tough.  the way i was taught, beggers cant be
choosers.  if you want a vw mag, then you have to take whats out there,
or start your own mag.  go ahead, start your own mag so you can see how
hard it is to stay above water without enough advertisers to keep you
afloat.  if whats out there has some watercooled cars mixed in with it,
then tough, it just shows that times change, and we have to change with
them.

i dont want to see watercoolers any more than you do, and yes, i love to
see a lot of buses like you do, but hey, thats business, and if they
have to do it to stay alive, well, ive got no problem with that.  

lets just give him a while and see how it goes, ok?

&gt; To All,        First of all the old editor of VW Trends is a friend of
&gt; mine,so I'm  a bias reader.
&gt; As a bus lover, I know we lost an editor who loves buses!!!! and we are left
&gt; with some
&gt; chump who can't even keep his bug running and who hasn't driven one in
&gt; years!!! I still don't understand his logic in writing his first
&gt; editorial.Does he want us to hate him?
&gt;         Henry did not get demoted, on the contrary .He really likes his new
&gt; position and if he is happy that is great, but the rest of us have to read a
&gt; magazine that is now run by non VW guy and a non BUS guy!! A double lose to
&gt; the bus community.Did you ever notice how many buses were in trends compared
&gt; to hotvws?That was because of Henry!
&gt;             my rant for the day.
&gt; 
&gt;                 woody
&gt; 
&gt; ps.This is strictly my opinion but I bet that trends starts catering more
&gt; and more to the water cooled market again.
&gt; Specifically the new beetle owners. my 2 cents.
