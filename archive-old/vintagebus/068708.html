Subject: Re: [VB] Mirrors

http://blueridgejan_dot_com/samsbus/63singlecab/mirrors_seat_belts/index.html

The best mirrors that I have seen for a pre-67 bus are the ones I got in 
Germany 2 years ago.
I believe that they were made for firetrucks (Feuerwagen) and you can see 
them in the link above.
BTW Clara has the box that they came in. We did check the numbers on the box 
but could find no pictures in Clara's parts book for a 211 857 513 C.
I did replace the driver's side mirror with a flat instead of the original 
convex mirror.
