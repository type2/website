Subject: Bus rack to Oregon

Fellow list members, I may need to have my rack transported from Red
barn/Kelly Park to the Oregon area.
Is there anybody coming down from Oregon that would be willing to take it
back with them?
I will work out some compensation for anybody interested.  Parts or cash.
plmk
