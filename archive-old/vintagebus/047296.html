So I pulled out my shift rod and reinstalled it cleaned it out and put

grease in it etc.. It seems to work OK - but I didn't do anything to adjust

it.  How would I adjust it.  First does seem a little strange - when I put

it in first it just doesn't seem to be there - no click or clunk or

anything - sort of like it is almost there but not quite - though first

works fine as do all of the gears.  I do know that is a there gear shift

adjuster extrodinaire on the list but how does he do it?


TIA

you adjust it my loosening the two bolts on the floor of the cab, the ones 
that holld the shift stick in, and move the assembly slightly to adjust it.  
IF you had this apart before you did alter the shifting at the stick 
somewhat.   sounds like you need to adjust it so it goes into first all the 
way past the detent ball.
