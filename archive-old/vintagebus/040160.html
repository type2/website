&gt;i must say the quality of construction of the ez-camper is pretty
&gt;poor...things that should have been cut straight are not, holes that should 
&gt;be
&gt;centered are not...and who had the bright idea of using pin nails to hold
&gt;everything together, they may work great in a piece of furniture but not a
&gt;machine that is shaking all the time.

yea, but at the time these were being produced, they couldnt make them fast 
enough. i think the EZ's were done for dealers and walk-in's so they were 
pretty busy. i like the hand-craftedness of the interiors.
