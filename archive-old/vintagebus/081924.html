&gt; Do most of the type 2 camp outs that you attend have

The closest thing I get to a hot shower at a bus
camp-out is when I spill my morning coffee all ove
myself!! (But then again, I'm kind of a slob!) 
Anyway, I think that modern plumbing facilities are
important for a decent FAMILY EVENT.  Wives (or
husbands!) and kids don't seem to do well with pit
toilets (at least MINE don't)  Personally, I could go
weeks without a shower and have no problem pooping in
hole, but there are many who want some modern luxuries!
