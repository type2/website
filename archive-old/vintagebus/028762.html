Hey Dave,

I can't believe someone with Kadrons hasn't spoken up. Oh well, here's
how I do my weber 34ICT's, it should be about the same as for your
carbs.

You turn the mixture screw (the one with the spring) in until the engine
slows down. Then you back it out until you find the spot where the
engine doesn't speed up any more. Do that on both sides. Then use the
idle speed screw on each side to make the synchronizer read the same on
each side. When you're done, there shouldn't be any backfiring through
the carbs on hard acceleration.
