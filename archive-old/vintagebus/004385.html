In addition to shipping problems (I ship fragile stuff almost daily via UPS,
and *nobody* gets my blood pressure up higher than  they do!), we are all
fallible. Nobody is perfect, but everyone deserves a chance to correct their
mistakes. I've made...err...one or two mistakes in my lifetime. :-) Running
a small business is not easy, especially when one has employees to keep
track of, ordering to do, inventory control, pricing, receiving, shipping,
customer relations.....then to add website updating! Phew! Give 'em all a
break!

&gt; I've stayed out of this 'never ending thread' for one reason and one
&gt; reason alone.  I've never ordered from Bus Depot.  However, I do have
&gt; a comment to make regarding shipping.
