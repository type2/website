Subject: RE:original 67 ignition

Please note that I did not say they couldn't be rekeyed, only that I don't 
recommend it and neither does (did) Volkswagen.  The fact that replacement 
internal parts for that assembly are not available and never were should 
also point out that it was intended to be a sealed unit and not 
disassembled.  The locks is held together by a small wire loop, and it 
cannot be removed without distorting it.  Upon re-assembly it will NOT be as 
sound as it was before being worked on.  I have and do disassemble them, but 
if it were my bus, I'd stick with the published recommendation of Volkswagen 
and replace the ignition and then rekey the other locks to match.  That is 
the correct way as stated by Volkswagen in their original key book supplied 
to the dealers.  It clearly states that VW dealers are not to take that 
ignition apart to rekey it-only replace it and to rekey the other locks to 
match if the customer wants to retain correct single-key operation.  I don't 
care who does the work...the CORRECT way is stated in the official VW 
manual.  Gabe can do it, I can do it, and there are several others, but I 
strongly urge my customers to follow the correct procedures.
