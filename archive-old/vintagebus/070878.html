Subject: Brake MC clarification (correction)

sorry, the links in my previous post don't work so, just go to cip1_dot_com and
look up part nos. ACC-C20-4100 (adaptor) and VWC-211-611-021-AA (MC).

&gt;
&gt; The links below are to pages of cip1_dot_com are for the dual-circuit MC and
the
&gt; adaptor to use it in a '67 or earlier bus.
&gt;
&gt; I've purchased the MC but, not the adaptor as the price ($59.95) is more
than
&gt; the MC ($39.95). I intended to use the procedure by described under
&quot;brakes&quot;
&gt; in the type2 library. Now, however I've changed my mind and decided the
&gt; adaptor may be the easiest route.
&gt;
&gt; My question is: does anyone know of any other adaptors out there that are
&gt; cheaper than this? The kit consists only of a machined ring to set the MC
back
&gt; from its mount, a boot, two bolts, and two nuts. Seems pretty pricey for
said
&gt; items. Although, I don't have cnc machines to do the fancy machining.

&gt; So is it true that a later and cheaper master cylinder can be fitted with
an
&gt; adaptor to a 68 - 70 Type 2 without problems?
&gt; If so this is good news as the 68 to 70 master cylinders are expensive. I
&gt; paid over $100 ten years ago.
&gt;
&gt; How much is the adaptor or does it have to be taken from a later Type 2?
&gt;
&gt; By the way I'm pretty sure the first Type 2 discs were 71 not 72 as
someone
&gt; stated. In Muir's book he discusses the annual Type 2 changes but
overlooks
&gt; 71 disc brakes.
