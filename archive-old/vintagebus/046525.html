Hi all,

	My wife and I are tentatively planning to head east of the Cascade Mt's
and attend the Apple Valley VW Assoc's &quot;Volksfest '98&quot; near Yakima, WA.
Are there any other listees that are planning to attend the festivities
and/or Camp in your busses??  If not, can anyone suggest a nice
campground in the local area??  We are planning to camp in our E-Z and
have a nice relaxing VW weekend.  It would be nice to hook-up with any
listees and do some camping as this will be our first camp out in our
E-Z.  I've never camped in the Yakima/Union Gap area before or been to
Volksfest either.  We hope to see you all there.
