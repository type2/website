Subject: ball joint front end

My 66 came with a 68 or 69 front end. I had considered swaping it out
with the king pin that is installed now. Did a little searching in the
archives &amp; chose not to do the switch because of the height change.
But one thing I found odd was about the advantages to ball joint. One
of the things listed was better ride. Can anyone explain what exactly
this is? Better how? I like the way my bay drives, but to be honest I
now prefer the handling charastics of the split.
