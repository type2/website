Subject: RE: [T2] Wheel Bearing Identification

&gt; I recently bought a what was supposed to be a bus rear wheel bearing 
&gt; (211 501 283) for a couple of bucks. 
&gt; Is there a database somewhere which identifies 
&gt; bearing applications by the numbers marked on the bearings, 
&gt; maybe with a cross reference to VW part numbers?


That IS a VW part number. Enter the number, without spaces, in the
&quot;search by part # &quot; field on the left menu bar of my site, and it is
identified as a '64-70 outer rear wheel bearing.
