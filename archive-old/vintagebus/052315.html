Subject: FS: $350 Kombi

I have a 66 Kombi for sale that needs a little work,
but is doable.  Needs rockers and left rear corner.
See www.thesamba_dot_com/vw for more details, or call
(503)797-5417 or (503)625-9201.

I was going to do the work myself and use this as a
Daily Driver, but I am tied up in other projects and
my wife has lost patience.

=====
Enjoy your day!
