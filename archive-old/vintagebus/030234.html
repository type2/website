&gt; 2L crank and rods, hydraulic cam and lifters, and on transmissions without
&gt; the sleeve for the release bearing, a special KEP flywheel (for use on my
&gt; bus.)
&gt; 
  My friend put one in his 67 splitty with a stock bus 210 (215 should
work too)
flywheel with a bus stock clutch.. AND an adapter that comes on some new
clutches
that converts them for use in either new or old trannied cars id think.
If you find
this you could come out ahead. Fat performance makes ana adapter
flywheel as well..

 Also dont forget you will have to fab an exaust of some sort.. Being in
a bus 
you might get lucky and a later model bus exaust of some sort will bolt
right up.
My friend had to fab one.
