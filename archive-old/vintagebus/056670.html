Congrats on dealing with CA DMW on that issue.  I just so happened to have 
accomplished the same task, although I thought that they were going to deny 
the request.  Bought an  Arizona 67 Sundial in Lake Havasu during BBB (thanks 
Ronnie for putting me onto it) and it just expired registration from CA and 
re-registered in AZ.

I did the affadavit and lo and behold, the great state of CA granted me the 
original plate.  It is currently in PA at Darryl's Plate Restoration being 
&quot;beautified&quot;.

BTW, we talked at BBB and I admired your camper and trailer ( I was in town 
shopping for a bus you may recall).
