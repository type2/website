&lt;&lt; Why would you use roofing tar for this?? All you are trying to do is to
 lock out moisture. Why not just use a good quality enamel paint?&lt;&lt;SNIP&gt;
 Personally, I would use two coats. The first coat would be a good zinc
 chromate. This can be had for about $20 a gallon. &gt;&gt;
Hi Les,
Due to experience with type 1 floor pans up here.  The thin styrofoam 
sandwiched between layers of tar paper are spot glued with tar to the 1960s 
and later floor pans.  Under and around for several inches of these tar spots 
the floor pan will be perfect metal and paint from the factory.  Everywhere 
else beyond all too often is surface rust and holes!  In other words it 
replels rust.  Zinc chromate would be our choice with a good layer of paint 
over that, but to really have the zinc work right one would have to sand off 
the old paint and apply it.  Unfortunitly most folks and volks are too lazy 
to do this.  since we are down to metal on the roof of our 1960 panel we will 
be using a zinc primer, paint over that and still apply a thin coat of tar 
over all!
