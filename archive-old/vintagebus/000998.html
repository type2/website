Harry in Fresno wrote &gt;&gt; Who cares where the buses go? It'll go to a human
on this planet, right?  I'll draw the line at interplanetary and
cross-species bus sales. Call me a bigot, but who knows what methane gas at
200c will do to rockers, much less the damage done to vinyl seats by
carborundum bib-overalls.


Methane should be quite non-reactive to the rockers unless it explodes but
watch out for that carborundum stuff ;-)

I don't know... I imported my 59 double cab from almost 20 blocks away from
my house and I have in my possession a 'california' ghia coupe.  Shame on me
for importing!
