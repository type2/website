I'm currently uploading a 1.1meg .wav file (ouch - I didn't know it'd be
that big!) of me narrating and then letting you listen to the local radio
station on the old Sapphire.  I also tune through the dial (only picking up
static from the fluorescent shop light) and push the dial buttons.  Step
back in time 30 years and go listen.

The upload is currently 80% done so wait about 5 minutes after receiving
this message, and then click on the URL.  I gotta get outside and start
working on the bus again...
