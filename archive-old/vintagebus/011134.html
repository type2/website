the back part of the front seat is the same through barndoor to ch# whenever
they started the humpback seat-  (6xx xxx ? through till the 1/3 2/3 front
seat happened, i am beginning to believe)   

the bottom part of the front seat on a barndoor is part # 211 881 031.

for a post barndoor (thrugh july 62) is part # 211 881 031 A

These seats are physically interchangable, but are different.    Put a later
seat bottom in the 54 kombi as the mice had taken all the stuffing out of the
original seat bottom and stuffed it in the area under the seat to make a nest,
which smelled, and the seat was less than rear end friendly, a later one was
nicer than leatherette on bare springs.   

I did not see a rear seat in a double cab in my parts list, and therefore I do
not believe in it.
