Subject: Re: [VB] On labels

Have you ever noticed how you get flashed the peace sign whenever you are
out driving around in your bus?  Why?

Those guys are just lost souls ................. they're in limbo and
should be avoided at all costs.
Oh by the way, after a guy gets stuck behind me on the highway at 60/65
mph for a few minutes I see the bird much more often than the peace sign.
