 I couldn't find a reference to this sway bar in the Bentley manual, but in
 another manual I had it said to bend the tab of the mounting clip up at the
 widest end and then hammer it off.  I managed to bend the tab, but have not
 managed to move the clip at all.  I am trying to move it the correct way -
 anyone got any ideas on how to remove them?
............................................................................
 yes these can be rusted and a pain to remove.   If you don't hit them 
exactly so the piecs will grab each other.  I'd take a grinder and cut along 
the small piece you are trying to pound out.  You can buy new clamps (and 
rubber bushings) fairly inexpensively.
----------------------------------------------
 Next question is about the torsion leaves - should I remove the grease from
 them or just bag them up as they are whilst the beam is powdercoated?
 ....
just bag them up.  If you clean them they'll rust.  I never clean engine 
parts if they be stored for more than a week.  In fact I sometimes oil or 
grease them.
--------------------------
 Powdercoating - whilst looking in the archives I spotted a handy tip about
 using two long pieces of thread all to hold rubber and wood at either end to
 prevent the sand going into the torsion tubes.  What should I do about the
 grease nipples?
 ............... 
remove them and plug the holes.   Could use a die on a piece of wood and 
screw it it. 
----------------
 Last question now - I disconnected the link that goes from the steering box
 to the swivel pin at the swivel pin end.   However the link has a lot of
 side to side movement - I can push it into and pull out from the steering
 box quite a distance - is this normal?
...
not clear which bit you are talking about.  Steering bar has a pit man arm on 
it.  sometimes the shaft that the pitman arm is on can be pulled in/out (or 
side to side depending on your frame of reference) No this isn't good, 
whether it's bad enough to rebuild is your call.  I've seen it often enough.  
driven with it.  it only gets more worn.   To the pitman arm it the drag 
link- whch has ball joint ends at front, and at back attaches to the assembly 
at the swing lever.   The swing lever should not have play.  Neither end of 
the drag link should have play.
 ----------- -- - - -
 Whilst on the subject I am glad I decided to take it apart - one of the link
 pins was so badly worn I was surprised there wasn't more movement than there
 was.  Old grease had clogged up I think and was preventing it from being
 greased at all.  Taking it apart was one of the messiest jobs I have ever
 done - many years of greasing makes lots of mess.  Took me 45 mins to clean
 all my tools!
