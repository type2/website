Subject: semaphores

Does anybody know how to run 6 volt semaphores on a 12 volt system? I have a
friend with them on his panel bus and I also have them on a 60 type 1, and
both of us have the same problem. I recall back in the eighties that a
electric device called a volt-a-drop was sold but cannot remember who sold
these and if they would work on semaphores. I dont want to overload these
things with double the voltage and kill them.
