Subject: Paint Code Help

I need some help in deciphering my paint code...
the third entry on the third line of my M-Code plate reads:
523907; so is that 52 (upper color), 39 (lower color), 07 (interior
color), and what are these colors?
this is my '66 SO42.

BTW for Jim Barnes NEATO Stat Master Extrordinarie, that was me who
passed you a week ago Saturday on Hwy 64 headed east.
