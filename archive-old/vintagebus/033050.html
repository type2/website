The boxes will work on either vehicle, but the hookup for the linkage is 
different on both.  I have a bus heater box on the driver's side of my '65 
Bug, it works fine, linkage will not hook up though.  For a bug, the linkage 
needs to be at the bottom of the little arm thingy (technical term).  The bus 
one is at the top.

&gt; I can't for the life of me figure out what is supposed to be different 
&gt; between
&gt;  a bus heat exchanger and a bug one (fresh air)!  I'm at a bone yard with my
&gt;  old one and I see that he has a bunch of used ones - but they all look the
&gt;  same!  Mine was never hooked up so I don't know if it was right for the 
bus..
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt;  If they are different, will a bug one work?  Why are they different? *I'm 
&gt; sooo
&gt;  confused*
&gt;  
&gt;  Any help would be appreciated!
