Hey all,

I'd have to agree with Dave, Vintage Auto deserves another chance to area 
veterans.  I just moved into the area 5 months ago and got turned on to the 
shop immediately.  Everyone was super friendly and helpful, especially dave 
and steve.  I hadn't purchased my current bus at the time of introduction to 
the shop and yet the shop made me feel a lot better about going air cooled 
again (been water pumpin for the past 5 yrs).  Prices can be more expensive 
but everybody offers much help and advice and don't make me feel like and 
_at_## for asking to pull a brake line or something 15 minutes before they 
close...thats worth something!  I will give business to another area shop if 
I need something now being that Vintage doesn't stock alot of splitty parts 
but on the flip side steve knows what I need when I ask for it and can have 
it the next day with the most competive price possible at that time.  Just 
wanted to kick some support where I have been supported!

&gt;You will usually get Steve, our parts guru, but I will be answering more
&gt;calls now. We handle WCM, Empi, RMMW, TMI, Bugpack, etc. Most of our
&gt;business is local, but we've shipped parts all over the place (even
&gt;Germany, of all places).
&gt;
&gt;My original post was meant to be generic, applying to any FLAPS, but now
&gt;I see this as an opportunity to help our business specifically. Who
&gt;knows, maybe we could compete with those online venders as well... I'll
&gt;have to look into that.
