Subject: [BM-ArtCars] RE: VW chassis


&gt; There is a large stack of VW beetles and vans on the southern end of Santa
&gt; Rosa, on Yolanda Avenue.  It's in a dirt lot that has a big sign in front
&gt; of it, announcing the sale of parts.  I know they sell whole units, as
&gt; well, since the van that was on the top of the stack is gone and another
&gt; vehicle is in its place.  (I think it's someone's collection, or a
&gt; dedicated VW wrecking yard, that's being sold out.)
