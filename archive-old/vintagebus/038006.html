That's great, they have stores everywhere and that is cheap.

Reading some of the responses to this post, I get the sense of the two 
methods of bus ownership and maintenance (I can fix it and change a starter) 
vs. (buy all new parts, dont work on it as much).  Me I have a forever 
Schucks (same as kragens and checkers) starter in my 65.  It died a year and 
a half after I got it, while I was 450 miles from home.  Went to the local  
Kragens and traded it in, no big deal to change a starter for me.  Still 
going fine years later.    Got one in my bug too.  But since I can do the 
clean and polish rebuild on generators,  I now have a stack of good 
generators out of my piles of mystery dead ones.  Any one want to buy a cheap 
generator?   get some space under the workbench.  I find electrical things 
die two weeks out of warranty, and the new bosch generators have a one year 
warranty (I think).  so I would rather have the forever warranty.

 I just bought a rebuilt generator from Kragen for $39.95 + $15 core.
Thought I'de share the good deal.  If you call and ask it is listed as an
alternater.  I think the part number is 15270.  The only generator they
list is an $80 Bosch.  So if you want a good deal look for their $40
generator with a lifetime warrenty.  The one I bought was originaly made by
Bosch and rebuilt in some impoverished 3rd world country by barefoot
children.  But hay it only cost $40 and I never have to buy another one again.
