Subject: [VB] Got a westy! Broke down on the way home
Message-ID: &lt;386A34BA.1A70D7B0_at_acvw_dot_com&gt;

Hi Volks,
Well I filled my bus void got a '70 westy in Elizabethtown, PA.  Started
right away and I drove it two blocks to fill it up.  Started right away
and pulled up to use the facilities. Came out, vroom right away.  Drove
45 minutes on highway and the bus purred like a kitten.  Came to a light
in Lancaster, Stalled!  Go to start it, Nothing from the starter!
Pushed it into Mc Ds lot.  Pregnant wife and a cranky four year old
waiting for dad to figure out what was going on.  Got all my tools out,
WHERE'S MY VW BIBLES!!! Well trying to remember checking out the starter
and such, uh, uh, uh, can't remember killed too many brain cells in
college. Go home which is only 50 miles or so.  Read up in Muir and the
archives, get something to eat, try to get some of my vw buddies to help
(impossible to find when you need their help).
My lovely pregnant wife says &quot;I'll put casey in her PJ's, let's go&quot;  I
almost had a stroke.  My wife who just shakes her head at my obsession
actually is excited about this camper.  I guess it's the idea of the
family thing.  Plus she said that this westy is a hell of a lot better
looking than anything else I brought home.

Well off we went and it started snowing on the way there.  I got out my
stuff, spread the bible and archive print outs in the bus and went to
work.  Lights were plenty bright. battery ok.  Crawl under bus to try
the screw driver trick to by pass solenoid.  Sparks but no whirl.
Hmmm...  starter must be shot says the kooky math teacher.  Lets jump
it!  I look over to my trusty crew:  A four year old princess in her
footy pajamas snuggled up with her 'Blanky' and a very pregnant wife
that wants to help but.....  &quot;I'll jump start it myself , there is a
little down grade.&quot;  Well, not much luck, tried with my wife as driver
and still wasn't able to do it.  I am trying to locate some help at
home, but is there anyone in that area (Lancaster, PA) that can lend me
a hand?  I'll take a push, a tow, a pat on the back saying it will be
ok.  Thanks for listening.

Joy thru air,

Jamie
