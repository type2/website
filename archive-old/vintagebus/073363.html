&gt; Hey Y'all,
&gt; I have just been notified by Bus Depot that a little
&gt; part I need is not available. It is the little
&gt; thrust\cup spacer that goes on the outside of the
&gt; generator pulley on an upright engine (the thing just
&gt; under the pulley nut).

This is one of the few places where I like the aftermarket chromie
stuff better than OEM. The &quot;dress up&quot; part picks up more of the threads on
the shaft and has a bigger &quot;acorn&quot; nut to get your wrench on.  The stock
nut always seemed a bit thin and wobbly to me considering the relatively
high torque to which it was subjected.  Consider this while shopping.
