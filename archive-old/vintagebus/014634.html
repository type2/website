&lt;&lt; Does anyone have a spare bearing they'd be willing to send...asap?!  or
 tell me where i can get one.  I need this bus rolling saturday for the
 event(s). &gt;&gt;
Hi Isaiah,
Definitely just replace all four of those bearings in there.  If you do it 
right you will not have to do it all too soon again.  Since most likely the 
other bearings have been damaged by the shrapnel of the first one to go bad.  
The upper and lower outer bearings are differant type each, the upper and 
lower inner two bearings are the same in the post-1963 bus supensions.
