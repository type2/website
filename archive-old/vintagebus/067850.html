&gt;Hi Everyone,
&gt;
&gt;I found this unique little toy while surfing the internet. It is called a
&gt;3vinyl killer2 ( go to http://www.funkyzilla_dot_com scroll to the bottom of the
&gt;page ). Has anyone ever seen this before?  I wonder if it actually works?
&gt;Pretty cool!
&gt;
&gt;Have a great day!
&gt;
yes it works - even has a decent-quality needle and pickup in it! 
speaker is a bit small, tho :)

looong ago i organized a mass List buy on these - sold through 
something like 30 of em.
fun bus collectible, fun for music buffs. we paid around $70 
including shipping back then.
