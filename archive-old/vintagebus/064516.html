Subject: Re: [VB] safety.Re: Front Shift Rod Coupling: Why cut/weld
  rather than tap?

Yes, ALWAYS use eye protection when grinding.    better safe than sorry.   
Best to make sure you have long sleeves/thick jeans as well, as little metal 
bits can hurt your skin.  Point your face directly at the thing you are 
cutting- the metal bits can get past safety glasses if your head is averted 
or turned.   Aim the stream of bits away from you if possible, and away from 
glass, as the bits stick to glass.  Or cover any windows near the grinding. 
Be careful about handling the sharp edges of freshly cut/ground pieces of 
metal with your bare skin, as sharp edges will cut you.  Gloves are cheap.  
Even though duct tape works well on cuts and sticks better than bandaids.  
I've gotten more anal about using ear muffs as well, when I didn't use to.   
Use sturdy blocks or jack stands when working under a jacked up bus.  etc etc 
etc.  blah blah blah  be safe, guys

 This method worked good for me several years back.  It only cost me $50
 for my trip to the urgent care center to get little pieces of metal
 removed from my eyes.   I figured safety glasses would protect my eyes.
 Use goggles.
