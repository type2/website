Subject: rear seat belts

I've just picked up a '64 Sundial camper and am itching to do some
traveling.  However, concerns for the family's safety does need to take
priority.  I've searched the archives and found limited info on the possible
options for installing rear seatbelts.  I can't seem to locate any plastic
plugs or other such things that might indicate a mounting point for the
belts. Navigating the belts around the fold out cot also seems to present a
problem.  The open roads are a callin', but I can't answer until I can belt
in the kids!  Any help is appreciated.
