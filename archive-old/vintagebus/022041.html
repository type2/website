&lt;&lt; I hooked it back up, squirted WD-40 everywhere and good as new.  I guess 
after 34 years of use the bar had straightened out enough or the door had 
stretched out enough for the mechanism to not work quite right. &gt;&gt;
Hi Andy,
Next time just use 30 Wt oil.  WD-40 is great stuff for getting rusted 
together stuff to move, but because it is so light is evaporates in just a 
couple of days!  So you have to follow up with the heavier oil to keep things 
lubricated.   Eric&amp;Barb
