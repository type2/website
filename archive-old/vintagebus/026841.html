Subject: Fire Extinguisher story...

I sent this one yesterday, but didn't know about certain 4-letter
filters Thom has on the list. Whoops! here is an earlier, edited for
television post that Ty Hodges already responded to, in case you all
were confused...

Couple years ago I was riding with my buddy Tannon in his slammed 67
daycamper westy when his engine caught on fire 1/2 block from his house.
He didn't have an extinguiser so he ran home to get one, while I
stripped off my t-shirt and tried to smother the fire, as it had only
lit up the wiring so far, now that the fuel was shut off...well, Tannon
left his keys in the ignition so he couldnt get into the house, so he
was crawling in a window and got stuck, no shi*te. Well, I had the fire
all but out with my poor old Phoenix bug-a-rama tshirt when a fogie in a
caddilac stopped and blasted me and the engine compartment with his
extinguisher. Seems he bought a bus new in 1953 in Germany and has kept
an extinguisher in every car ever since. Says he saved his bus twice. I
was grateful, so didnt mention trying fuel line clamps. Later we greased
Tannon like a pig and pushed him out of the window, about the time the
fire department rolled up to see what all the smoke was about.

If you all don't believe this story, ask Ty, he knows all about it.
And ask him about his 412 in Ensenada. There is a fire story.
