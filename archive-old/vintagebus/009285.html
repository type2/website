Greetings:

Have recently rebuilt a 1600 DP in my 73 SB.  Engine runs great.

Is is possible to have a 34PICT3 that won't stumble AND will start easily
when engine is warm or hot?

Facts:  New 009 &amp; coil, new wires, new plugs. Points checked for gap. Carb
cleaned, checked and rebuilt. Float level adjusted per specs.  All smog crap
disconnected.  Carb adjusted per book.  Engine timed properly. Running a
Delta 10 cam.

It had the typical stumble on acceleration.  Tried the trick of pop rivet in
butterfly plate with no luck. Rebuilt carb, ran worse than ever.  Took pop
rivet out and readjusted carb.  Stumble gone, acceleration great and good
performance.  Mileage appears nominal.  And now it acts flooded when you
start it when warm or hot and you have to floor it and crank for 5-8 seconds
to get it started.  That just appeared after the rebuild and elimination of
stumble.

What am I overlooking?  Or am I expecting too much?  All replies greatly
appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
