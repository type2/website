Subject: bus metal needed

hi volks,
anybody here currently parting out a bus?  im looking for the entire overhead
fresh air vent section and also the bulkhead for the passenger side seat from
a walk-thru (i think any year will fit).  ive got from the pedestal down, i
just need the metal back.  seems there are no junkyards here in buffalo with
split buses.  ive lived here a year and a half and been to about a dozen yards
with no luck.  thanks!
josh
