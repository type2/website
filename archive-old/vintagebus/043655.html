Hello all!

In compiling the VintageBus archives, we found that we have a few gaps in the
coverage.  Some of you might have saved old digests or individual list messages
from those times - if so, we would greatly appreciate a copy!  We can deal with
most any format you might have - plain text, HTML, Outlook mailbox, Eudora 
mailbox, Netscape mailbox, VMS mailbox, Unix mailbox, etc - we will be converting
them to HTML just like the current messages.

The dates we are looking for include anything from vintagebus list:

up to and including June 1998
September and October 1998
all of 1999

If you have something in this range, please send it to me at mattroberds_at_home_dot_com .
I'll get it converted and put in the archives as soon as I can.  If you have
any questions, please let me know.

The archives would not be as useful as they are, or even *exist*, without
everyone's contributions throughout the years!  Thanks for helping make this
a valuable resource!

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
