Subject: Re: [VB] Vent window seal help..

They are nearly impossible. I know guys who have beautiful, showroom quality
busses that won't let you open their wind wings because they were so hard to
get right. I ended up cutting some of my rubber and it will never be right.
You Must let the rubber glue dry before you try to put the wings back on or
it will never stay in place at the bottom.

&gt; I am in need of some help replacing these vent window seals.  Like how to
&gt; start them in the frame, what to use, and can I plan on really spending
some
&gt; time and muscle on these things.
