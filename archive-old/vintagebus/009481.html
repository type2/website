what about the fact that VW &quot;initiated&quot; changes in certain years but that
some buses could have, lets say, a X bumper,  while the same year  of
another bus has an earlier  Y bumper? Whos to say whats correct or not when
there was so much variance of what the factory still had left in the
storeroom? Does joeblow win over sally cause he bought the NOS cheaper
bumper that most same year models have, but sally bought the slightly used
$$$$$$ earlier bumper that the OG owner told her that her bus had
originally? If the OG owner asked the factory to paint polka dots and they
did, does that mean its &quot;original&quot;? Whos to say hes not full of bs? Seems
like VWs would be too hard to judge for vintage purity since the guidelines
vary so much and its &quot;he said, she said, the book said, the OG owner said&quot;
and so forth... And the fact we still dont have factory authorized vintage
parts program as someone else mentioned, hence the confusion - or absence of
knowledge. Seems to me like the other concours classes have it down to the
fine print, and everything was Factory specific perfect and no screwups or
questionables? I could be wrong...
