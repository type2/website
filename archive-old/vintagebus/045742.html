&lt;&lt; Check with Susan Dolvin on the Wetwesties list.  She and her recent Ex use 
to 
 sell them.  As far as we had heard the repro of this part they produced was 
 perfect!  If you can still get them get a spare!  Eric&amp;Barb
  &gt;&gt;
If you want to purchase these, Susan can be reached at susan_at_cellair_dot_com. I 
taked to her at woodburn, she still has these, and from talking to her, I'm 
under the impression that she will continue to make them. In my opinion they 
are very nice, I plan to get some for my 63 when time and money permit me to 
do that bus
