&lt;&lt; I want to put a gas gauge in my 59 double cab (don't worry, I'm not going

 cut the dash) but am curious about the sending unit.  I'm not interested in
 swapping tanks either. &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Unfortunitly if your tank is original you will have to cut and drill holes in 
it's top to allow the use of a sender.  Which was a dealer modification, that 
VW supplied blueprints, and instructions on how to do.  You might want to 
reconsider just installing a later tank instead.  Doing so is quite a bit 
safer due to less chance of blowing or burning yourself, and you could 
install a 1967 hump back tank or a post-1967 tank for more fuel capacity.
