&lt;&lt; what did the tv reporter call you?  &quot;mayor of hippy town&quot; or some such? &gt;&gt;

He called me the Honorary Mayor of the Volkswagen Village or something like 
that.  As far as the article in VW Trends, nobody said anything to us about 
it, it was a complete surprise.  And about being a celebrity, I WAS on the 
front page of the Havasu Paper, don't forget. (
