Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel Pump won't pump fuel.

I had the same problem a week or two ago after installing a fresh engine. =
Turned out to be an empty gas tank!
Blow into the fuel supply line and listen for bubbling. You might have a =
clogged fuel inlet in the tank or a clogged under-tank PO installed =
filter.=20

Yesterday my '66 quit about a block from home. I towed it home and found
that there was no fuel coming into the pump.=20
