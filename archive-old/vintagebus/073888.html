Subject: Re: [VB] Need help locating a stock looking Bus for a VW event

No offense to you miss Laura but I'm sorry, and flame me if you'd like,
but why the HELL would any vintage VW enthusiasts want to help VW????

Those jokers have been trying to shut down VW related web sites for over
two years.  They systematically destroyed any and all factory parts
production and have actively pursued the closing down of after market
parts production.  That company does not support people trying to keep
older cars/busses running, and is in fact hostile towards them.  But,
when they want to play on the nostalgic heart strings to get people
interested in a new product, well, they're really friendly.

Just my .02, but SCREW YOU VW!

&gt; Hello Vintage Bus Crowd!
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; The purpose is for the inclusion in the Living Volkswagen Event which is a part of the Phaeton Premiere taking place at the W Hotel in Manhattan this Thursday, November 13th.  My GTI will be on display at this event and the organizers (Volkswagen's marketing firm, Arnold) asked if I could help round up a vintage Bus.B
