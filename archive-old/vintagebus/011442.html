Hey everybody, Im in the process of rebuilding a bus motor from parts is
parts.  A friend of mine told me to use a later modle case because of the
bigger oil galleys and  also preferrably with 8mm studs, Is this good and
does anyone have one or know where to get one at a reasonable price?

Thanks in advance,
