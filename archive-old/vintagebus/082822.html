Hi Oly,
Why are you fondling the starter when someone is working the ignition switch? 
 ;-)
If you mean that the engine dies when you let the ignition switch spring from 
start to run position, it might be a bad ignition switch.  

&gt;&gt;Yesterday she quit spontaneously two or three times usually decelerating to 
a stop sign.
But after 6 or 8 resart attempts she fired up.&lt;&lt;

Idling mixture too rich?
