Harry,
Did I miss something as in a change in your domocile?
you using a 10x20' shelter to live in now?
Those things make good bus shelters, but are a bit drafty to live in.

I did have one of those over my driveway and bus, until the city regulation
nazis went nuts.  I was  going to head to the local surplus place where they
have ton's of tarps in both blue and silver and the correct size, but had to
take it down in a preemptive strike before I got written up.  Let me know if you
come up empty on your search

Scott
