Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

EVERY DAY, rain, shine, cold or hot.
Right now the DC is my daily driver and Only driver, 5 miles or 50 miles.
No problems in LA traffic, I keep right up with the best of them, drawing the line
at 80mph.
Gas mileage is great and I love watching the Mercedes SUV owners making their SUV
work overtime to get around me, pass and try and overtake.  &quot;Damn, Martha, you
better take this thing to the dealer, I just barely got by that old VW&quot;

Now what I've done to make the DC, LA traffic worthy is another story altogether.

&gt; all this &quot;bus sighting&quot;  &quot;stuff&quot; (to put it
&gt; politely) leads me to ask the following question/take the following
&gt; poll:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; how many of you actually DRIVE your bus
&gt; DAILY?!?!?!? (i will also accept any air-cooled vw in place of &quot;bus&quot;). NOT a
&gt; honda, ford, chevy, whatever, but a BUS (or air cooled vw)?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; no lame &quot;boo-hoo, i have to drive on the freeway&quot;
&gt; excuse. i do too--every day. i go 60-65 and people pass me.
&gt;
&gt; no &quot;boo-hoo, it's too cold&quot; wuss-out. i drove my
&gt; busses every day in cold pennsylvania winters for years--it's called making the
&gt; heat work well and learning to drive with gloves and a hat. i also learned to go
&gt; to the car wash somewhat regularly to wash the salt off, and my busses didn't
&gt; rust out.
&gt;
&gt; no &quot;boo-hoo, but i have to drive &quot;X&quot; amount of
&gt; miles every day&quot; whining. i drive my bus about 50 miles a day.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; i don't even own any other kind of car, so what
&gt; else WOULD i drive?!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; i'm just curious.
