&gt;&gt; If you are one of those that live for bias ply tires,
cable actuated brakes, and the guy walking in 20 feet in
front of you waving a red flag, then drive the Bus the way
it rolled off the line in '55.  If you are someone that
doesn't want to be run over everytime you pull out of the
driveway and hit the freeway, then this is an option to
consider. 
&gt;&gt;

That should be &quot;guy cutting you off 20 feet in front of
you&quot;.  ;(

Speaking of driving around in a stock '55:

I had people pass me twice this week, on the right, in the
emergency lane.  I was doing 50-55 mph in the slow lane of
a 3 lane freeway.  Uh, there's 2 other lanes, dumbsh!&amp;.

Sometimes I wish I could go off on someone with my
crankstart handle... wait, I might damage the handle.
