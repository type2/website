Subject: Re: [VB] rolled 50's Double Cab!!!

The one owned by the guy at Competition Engineering in Phoenix was also from
Texas (if I remember correctly), it had rear roof damage, although not to
the extent you would think from a rollover.  I personally thought the front
driver's pillar was crooked, although that was a point of contention.
