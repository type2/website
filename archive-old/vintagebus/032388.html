&gt;Anyone have any experience with spot welders?  There's a Hobart 115v model
&gt;that looks promising; it's $360 on the Harbor Freight site, $450 on the
&gt;Eastwood site.   The problem with these is you have to have access to both
&gt;sides of the work, which won't work for large areas like the cargo floors,
&gt;front floors, etc.

I have a Miller 115v spot welder (ms-41 I think) that I have used for 
attaching
inner rockers to outer rockers.  It does really nice clean welds, but you 
have to
have really clean bare metal for good results (both the outer surfaces 
where the
tongs contact as well as the surfaces where the 2 pieces of metal meet).  I 
use
normal 6&quot; tongs for this.

I also bought 18&quot; deep tongs in hopes of using it to do outer edges of cargo
floors, but I think that anything bigger than that tong-wise will be beyond 
the
useable scope of the 115v welder.  The biggest drawback to the spot welder
is it's weight...  it weighs 30lbs or so and can be a chore for one person to
use...  I have to set up braces to rest the welder on when I use it to help
support the weight.

Shop your local welding supply...  I got the same thing Eastwood was selling
for about $100 less...
