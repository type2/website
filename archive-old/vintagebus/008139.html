This is for all the Type2 and Vintage Bus listees out there in the countries
or the European Union.

I've been working out a deal with Ken and Bob to secure cds for all us.
Anyone who has tried to order anything from the States will know how long
winded and expensive it can be sometimes.

I have uploaded a short page to my own web site for those with browser
facilities - (if not please mail me and i'll send details to you)
Ordering details and the like are all there.

If anyone would like to verify what i say please do so. I'm sure Ken Hooper
or Bob Hoover wont mind you asking of my credibility.

http://website.lineone_dot_net/~hippybus/no6.html  or if you'd prefere to bypass
my flannel you can go right at it via
http://website.lineone_dot_net/~hippybus/sermonsEU.html

All the best for Xmas and the New Year

Glynn Seabridge
