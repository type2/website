This is a day late, but yesterday (St. Patties day) I went to long time list
member Matt Henricks wedding.  He did make the deadline and the sealing wax
red/beige gray '65 deluxe is DONE.  Correct and gorgeous!!!  He used it in the
wedding and there's not a stretch limo out there that could hold a candle to
it.  The perfect sunny day too.  Roof back, rack on, windows open and OG safaris
cracked (can't mess up the brides hair too much ;-).  They were riding in style.

Good thing he got all of that bus resto stuff out of his system, since all that
single man free time he used to have is long gone now ;-)

Congratulations Matt and Jenn.  May the force be with you   ;-)
