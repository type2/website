Subject: Sunroof cover replacement
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi.
I'm about to install my Wolfsburg West sunroof cover
on my bus.

Before I do, I thought I'd ask the list for any
tips/tricks/insider info. about the process.

I got the manual instructions from Thom's site, but
they seem incomlete, more of a removal tutorial. The
WW guy said something about gluing the cover to the
front bow. Is this right? What kind of glue should I
use?

Also, I'm not putting in a headliner piece at this
time, will this change anything?

ALSO: My bows seem bent all funky. Not the big square
bows but the round ones which spring up as you fold
the roof back. Should these be follow a smooth curve
like the square bows?  If so, how should I bend them
back to that shape? I figured I'd make a pattern from
a 2x4 cut with a jig saw, and then rubber
mallet-hammer them along it.

Here is a link to pics of the bent bows (for
reference)

Thanks

stock muffler - no more JC Whitney glasspack (whew!)
