You got that right!  When I went on a surfing trip there a few years ago,
it was all I could do to not get my a** beat every day by the locals.  The only
thing that afforded me any measure of respect was taking my own board,
which set me slightly apart from the rest of the groms and barneys...  Plus
I don't have haole coloring...
