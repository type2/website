Subject: Re: What is Sealing Wax Red?

must be each persons paint/body man's interpretation of the color... i know 
a guy in Michigan the has a supposed Sand and Palm Green bus like mine but 
its nowhere close to the colors mine is... i think mines closer :-) but his 
bus is much nicer! but, thats just the way 'his guy' mixed the colors. i 
guess you'll just have that with swatches and paint codes that are 50 years 
old.
