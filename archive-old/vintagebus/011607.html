&gt;  We
don't get personal e-mails from every new person all over the world asking
goofey questions that even a novice mechanic would understand.  Alot of
folks buy a VW and have no concept of mechanical things.  It's not their
fault on one hand, on the other Bob's patience probably ran out a long
time&lt;

Hey all,
        Maybe I was raised on old-fashioned standards but if a person asks
you for help and your response is condescending and belittling, then I
question your motive for responding.  What drives a person to be this way? 
If you are irritated by the simplicity or narrow-mindedness of a question,
why not delete it and spare the sender some grief?

        Secondly,  I have never gotten anything but clear, concise, and
super imformative information from Mr. Hoover.  I have the highest respect
for his insight and his will to share his lifes savings of experience.  I
thank him from the bottom of my V-dub loving heart!  I love the way he does
make you think on your own.  On the other hand, I have cringed and bit my
tongue on some of his remarks to some of the less &quot;well-thought-out&quot;
questions.  I admit, I even found some ot them amusing, but at the end of
the day, I felt bad for doing it.

        I am not the whiney type, but I do stand up for the things I care
about.  What hit me like a ton of bricks is anything, and I mean anything,
that discourages NEWBIES.  Like I said before, without newbies, we might as
well bury our buses along side our graves.

        Joe Fournier asked how this thread is pertinent to buses?  He's
right, we can do nothing more than whine about the &quot;way things are&quot;.  Well,
how about this, maybe Mr. Hoover is not aware (or maybe doesnt care) that
his ways are misinterpretted by so many next generation V-dub protectors. 
That is why I am CC'ing this post to Mr. Hoover.
