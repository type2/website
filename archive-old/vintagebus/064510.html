Subject: Re: [VB] VIN number help

If you look in the spec guide they start the year with the beginning of the
year till 1963 than they changed to August.  But in the forward of that
section in the spec guide they say 1957 was the first year for the change.
sorry for the mis-information!

&gt; &gt;685157 if that is the chassis number means that it is a means that it was
&gt; made between 11/18/1960 and 12/06/1960 meaning that it would be a 1960!
&gt; The year changed with the 1963 model in August but till than it was with
&gt; the new year!   &gt;
&gt; The change occured in 1955, not 1963.
&gt;
&gt; The model years are a bit random, they even differ between the Export and
&gt; German markets, but August is a good all-around month to use.
