Hey all,

I had the opportunity to check out a 67 Panel that was in decent general
condition.  Had bad cancer on the passenger side dog leg and the forward
most rocker behind the front whell on the passenger side, but other than
that was pretty decent.  It moved (no frozen drums - woo hoo!), but I wasn't
able to get it started.  I've got some ideas to that extent, but wondered
about a few things.  There was no plate behind the passenger seat and none
on the air box.  I went to the back to look in the engine compartment to see
what the actual VIN was, and was unable to find it.  I looked where I
*thought* it should be, but didn't see one.  Could it have been grinded off?
The old farmer who had it says his son had it for at least 10 years when he
died in an accident (not in the bus) about 8 years ago.  He always thought
about restoring it, cuz that's what his son wanted to do, but he's never had
the desire, so he's going to get rid of it.  Also, were most panels walk
thoughs?  This one looks like it was a bench seat model who's bulkhead was
decently hacked (if that's possible) into a walk through.  Since I have no
m-code plate or VIN, I really have nothing to go on.  A little help from the
list would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
Paul
