I agree with you that it's expensive to keep parts for out of production and
obslete vehicles. Many of the parts for late bugs are however still made by
VW in South America and are therefore not technically obsolete. Further to
this, the late model bug is not a typical out of production vehicle given
the number of these things that are still on the road and driven daily.  

Many of the assemblies in cars are not made by the 'manufacturer' anyway,
they are delivered to the factory by component suppliers. 

The fact that most of the stuff is made by after market suppliers suggests
that there is a demand for the parts used to maintain these vehicles. While
I accept that non essential(eg.trim parts) parts are not likely to attract
the attention of people keeping bugs on the road (rather than restoring
them), I suspect that factory engines, engine parts,trannies, brake parts
and that sort of stuff probably would sell. Just think of the industry that
has sprung up around the 'rebuilding' of these components.

I am also aware of the fact that parts sourced from a quality controlled
factory that carried a dealer warranty would have to sell at a premium to
those from a cheapy knock off shop in Taiwan.

I do think that VW could create an immense amount of goodwill(even if they
didn't make a vast profit) by making a limited range of relatively easily
sourced 'factory' parts and assemblies available through their existing
dealer network. I am NOT suggesting that they run something like this at a
loss. 

If Merc can run a program of this sort and make it work off a much wider
model range, I fail to see why VW, who built millions of examples of one
model that were substantially mechanically similar, couldn't turn something
like this to their advantage.

End of second lecture :-)
