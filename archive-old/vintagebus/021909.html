Greg writ:
&gt;but I really wanted a taller 5th for cruising on the freeway. No freeway
flyer out there can compensate for 195/55/15 tires, especially when been
pushed by a a 2007 cc motor, not exactly &quot;mild&quot; as Mr. Pillow
stated................. &lt;

Now you tell me!  LOL....  Okay here is my updated recommendation in light
of the new information.

You need a custom Berg 5-speed.  Drop the gears down by replacing 1st with
2nd and so on down the line and then use a freeway flier ratio for 5th.  I
am sure Berg or a good custom tranny shop can do this for you. 

If I had that type of engine and tires I would dump the RGBs and use drop
spindles on the front.  Nice and simple, plus it is reversible if desired.

Also you may want to check out the 914 tranny if it is a 5 speed as vvvince
reports.  I am not educated on the specifics of the 914s, but it should
definitely be suited for the 2L power and geared reasonably(if you run RGBs
it may screw-up the gearing and make this not so viable).
www.pelicanpats_dot_com will have good general information about the 914 if you
need it.
&gt;I have see lots of 914s and 912s with 5 speed trannys. Never seen a 4 speed
in either car. vvvince &lt;

I look at it this way, if the Porsche 930 (911 Turbo) can use a 4 speed so
can a VW bus with a little creative custom gearing.

PS.  If the 914 has a 5-speed tranny someone needs to tell the programmers
for Need For Speed: Porsche Unleashed because in the game it is a 4-speed.
