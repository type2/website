  Prescott was a blast, more on that later. 
  Driving out there, I was in my bus and my wife took her 65 bug (NEW 1600
Mexi engine that I took apart and put a Engle 100 cam in, pict 34, SVAD with
compufire and the new BOSCH Silver HEI coi;). At our first gas stop I took
9.6 (around there) gallons of fuel and she took 3.8, worked out to 35 plus
mpg. This was cursing at 65-70 mph. It was 100 plus degrees when we left at
our first stop to check, she seemed a little hot (engine that is) so I got
out the ol timing light and retarded the timing a few degrees. (fooled you,
my timing light consist of my ears listening to the pur of the engine,
retarding the timing consisted of a 1/8 inch clockwise motion of the dizzy).
On the way there and back in varying temps from the 100's to the high 70's
I could still pull the dips in either vehicle. 
  The Prescott camp-out was a blast except for the rain, all Friday night
from 2 am till 6 or so am. Sat. was over cast, then the rain came again Sat
night. Didn't put a dampner on all the fun though, this turned out to be a
great BUS family camp-out,  16 or more buses were there and more would have
been had they known where we were at.
  The Prescott show was a blast, filled up the whole football field with
VW'S, saw a bunch of old faces and a whole lot of new faces while there, the
bummer was the wife and I had to bail around 1 o'clock to make our way home
(you know, kids school, work, etc.), all in all it was a great weekend for
all.
