Hi all,

I just wanted to say that I will be showing my bus for the first time
since its completion so if any list members attend feel free and stop by
to say hi.  I will be in my pearl white 67 westy poptop in the show
area.  I would love to meet someone from the list since this list has
has been so valuable in my restoration process.  Hope to see some list
members there.

P.S.  Thanks Ty for the floor table leg thingy.  It worked out perfect.
