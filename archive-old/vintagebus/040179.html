TAR?


&gt;you'd think that with all this modern tchnology and marvel chemicals,
&gt;there's something better than tar


Youd think. But how many combanations of chemicals or molecules are there? 
At some point the electrons move one way or another, and somtimes simple 
elements by our thinking are whats going to work!


My wife and child are visiting the tar pits this week. And they (the pits) 
have preserved complex carbon molecules  for millions of years; take a 
lesson from nature, sometimes we have chemicals that arnt easy to improve 
on.


Jason.
