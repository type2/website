&lt;&lt; Have someone ready to pull the negative cable off their battery as soon as
 you get fired up. Simple. &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
The last cable you hook up and the first to be removed of the jumper cables
should be a ground jumper cable.  This ground must be hooked up away from the
top of the battery.  Some of the best places are the battery ground strap at
its body connection end or the heat riser tube on the engine.  Batteries
release hydrogen gas while functioning.  Have seen twice close up what happens
when a battery explodes.  Once due to the driver next to us with her new
Mustang when the water level in the battery was not kept up.  She turned the
ignition switch to start her car and instead a spark jumped from one exposed
plate to another in her battery and BOOM!  A real mess when the engine lid was
lifted.  
The other time was when a fellow Machinist left work only to find his battery
dead.  After asking a fellow worker for a jump, he was hooking up the last
jumper cable to his battery and BOOM!!!  The only reason he did not loose his
eyes to the acid is that he still had his safety glasses still on.  So he with
eyelids closed, two fellow workers rushed him into the shop to rinse him clean
of the acid.   
This is also the reason we keep our battery chargers unplugged until the
battery is fully hooked up first.  Then and only then will we plug in the
battery charger to the 110 household plug.    Eric &amp; Barb
