&lt;&lt; In my 66 Deluxe bus I just got, there is what looks to be a complete tool 
set inside of a shreded tool pouch. It looks like its made of little strips 
of material, but coming all apart. What tools should be in there and does 
anyone make repro tool pouches ? &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
&gt;From about 1955 on VWs came with tool bags of the same fabric as the seat 
upholstery in each VW.  Best to check your year VW owners manual for the 
correct tools for that year.   Eric&amp;Barb
