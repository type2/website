Subject: Re: [VB] Brake questions


Did he say would &quot;fix it&quot; for $141.00 or replace the master cylinder?

&gt; My mechanic says that my master cyclinder is what almost caused me to
crash
&gt; the other day. He says he can fix it for 141.00.  Is this right? From
every
&gt; magazine i've looked in , the 67 only master cyclinder is at least 200
&gt; dollars. how can he do this? i must be missing something.
