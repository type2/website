I also took out the wiring on my '67 Westy and had to clean up some breaks,
etc. A couple of hints:

- make sure the tailights are grounded to the body... use a test wire on
each taillight to effect a ground on both sides and see what happens.
Consider a permanent ground to the taillights. Screwing around by trying to
get a ground on the stock tailight set-up is exhausting and usually only
works short term.
- 9 prong box - I tired four of these before I got one to work. Even if you
have an NOS one moisture apparently gets inside and does strange things.
- the wire running along the gas tank and the drivers side ( heading to the
front?)sounds like the power source to the interior lights which is
Westfalia only. However this usually is attached to the +ve pole of the
battery and also has an in-line fuse.

&gt; I continued working on the Westy's less and less thrashed wiring today.  I
&gt; thought I would be finished up front today, but unfortunately there are
still
&gt; issues with turn signals and hazards.  I did more testing on the 9 prong
box,
&gt; and determined that it was bad.  The brake light wire did not get hot when
the
&gt; hazards were on (54).  So I pulled the Wolfsburg West replacement box out
of
&gt; the Kombi and plugged it into the Westy.  Hazards worked on all four
lights!
&gt; The turn signals, however, now only work up front.  ARGH!  I'm going to do
&gt; more testing Thursday but I now suspect the switch.  Looks like I had two
bad
&gt; things going on...I went ahead and pulled the indicator switch out of the
Kombi
&gt; since I knew it was good, and the one in the Westy doesn't like to stay
where I
&gt; put it anyway.
&gt;
&gt; Frustrated with the front for the time being, I moved to the engine
compartment
&gt; for the first time.  I've pinned down what wires do what now, and did some
&gt; rejoining of cut wires, cut out and rejoined (and covered) bare sections,
etc.
&gt; The solder + heat-shrink tubing makes for a really clean looking repair.
&gt;
&gt; One thing made me wonder back there.  In the Kombi, on the B+ terminal of
the
&gt; voltage regulator there's a fat red wire that runs back through the same
hole
&gt; that the positive battery lead and coil/oil wires run through.  On the
Westy,
&gt; there is a skinnier black wire, with an inline fuse, that runs in front of
&gt; where the gas tank was and back up by the driver's side engine louvers.
This
&gt; wire is inside stock-looking tubing like all the rest of the compartment
wiring
&gt; (the black plastic tubing) and doesn't look like a hack.  What gives?
Since I
&gt; wasn't sure about it, I spliced 10 gauge wire in with the positive battery
&gt; lead, and will also run that to B+ on the regulator.  This is how it is in
the
&gt; wiring diagram, but not on either of my buses.  Seems ok to me...someone
please
&gt; let me know if I'm being dumb here :-)
&gt;
&gt; More electrical fun on Thursday, hopefully I'll get it finished so I can
start
&gt; working on the brakes!
