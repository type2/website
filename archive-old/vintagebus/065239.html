&gt; &gt; Just for the record, this tool is worthless in my opinion. ...
&gt; &gt; It is hard to keep mounted on the joint/union area.
&gt; &gt; The bolt that is used to push out the tie rod bolt,
&gt; &gt; spins off when tightened ...
&gt;
&gt; I agree. I somehow got the bracket part to keep from slipping off (I
&gt; think this sounds like the same sort of gizmo I bought from them), but
&gt; the bolt actually bent when I tightened it and the tie rod end still
&gt; didn't come out,

I use a Chevy Pitman arm puller with a spacer I made from angle iron.  It
pulls tie rods, ball joints, and pitman arms.  It has a hefty fine thread
bolt with a centering point.  if the rod end doesn't have a centering hole
I use a small nut to save the point.

For stubborn tapered fittings I put the puller on, tighten it, and then
flex the pitman arm or swing lever by putting a small sledge hammer on one
side of the boss and whacking the other side with a ball-peen hammer.

If this fails, it's Blue Wrench time!
