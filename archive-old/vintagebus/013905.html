Steve,

Don't worry I am not offended......but I am sorry I
feel I have to justify my prices to you (or anyone) as
who really cares?  But see, I am tryin to sell the
bus...and a &quot;GEEE those safaris costs alot! duhhh..&quot;
comment does not do great for my efforts sellin it,
regardless if the wise crack comment is true or
not...make sense?  

But HEY!! I would be interested in buying your safaris
if they are not worth that much to you??...Almost NOS
parts and all! :-)  Give me your price!

Todd

&gt; Gee Todd,
&gt; 
&gt; Didn't intend on offending you.  Ask 2 grand if you
&gt; want....they're your
&gt; windows.  I was just surprised at the amount
&gt; original safaris are now
&gt; bringing.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW the weld ons that came with the original set I
&gt; have are NOS.  Does that
&gt; mean my windows are &quot;mainly NOS&quot;  or just &quot;partly
&gt; kinda sorta almost NOS&quot;?
&gt; Sounds like something you'd see on Ebay ;-)
&gt;

&gt; &gt; These safaris were mainly NOS units before
&gt; installed,
&gt; &gt; frames, orig VW glass, weld ons were all nos other
&gt; &gt; parts were mint used...worth every penny.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; See, I WANT to keep them for my other bus, thus
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; price, make sense?  Where am I gonnna find another
&gt; set
&gt; &gt; of all original VW safaris in this condition??  It
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; near impossible.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If the price seems high...just wait until you
&gt; decide
&gt; &gt; to restore yours! ;-)
&gt;
