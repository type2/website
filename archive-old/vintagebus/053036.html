Subject: Re: [VB] Time to start replacing glass seals - Safari

I don't have safari windows so I haven't tried this, but the &quot;a
caulk/putty/magic stuff that doesn't stick *too* hard&quot; you seek sounds
like one of the many formulations of &quot;Liquid Nails&quot;, a caulk-like
adhesive readily found at Home Despots and such stores.

This year I used tar on the body with my OG safari seals and frames. I
also put 1.5&quot; x 1/4&quot; weatherstripping in the opening before shutting
them. Still leaks, but doesn't pour. 2 years ago I painted paraffin in
the openings. That worked pretty well until the warm weather came and
it melted down the nose.  Last year it didn't rain, so I did nothing.
Is there a caulk/putty/magic stuff that doesn't stick *too* hard?

Do you use the same tar for the safari seal?  My Izzies safaris leak
like
they're open when it rains.
