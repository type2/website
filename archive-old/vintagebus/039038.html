&gt;What about just using some of those &quot;disposable&quot; cameras? No 
&gt;need for fancy polariod film and we could still have the web site. 
&gt;Those things are cheap enough.  I'd be willing to buy one to cover 
&gt;my leg of the trip if it comes through Knoxville.

Yeah, you're right.  I was just thinking that with the instant camera that
each subsequent participant would get to see the pics from the previous
folks, but that's really not necessary as long as the pics get posted for
all to see at the completion.

And what do you mean &quot;IF&quot; the trip comes through Knoxville??!  The fact that
you're there and want to participate means the trip &quot;MUST&quot; come through
Knoxville if you ask me.

Perhaps the way to get this thing flying would be to compile a list of
everyone who wants to participate and what city they're in and the max
number of miles they'd consider driving (duplicate locations might result in
a mini caravan to or from that city).  Then start mapping out a rough route
(city to city at least) that would cover everybody.  That would then get
sent back to the list and people could start volunteering for the various
legs.  If we decide to go this way, I'll volunteer to compile the names and
help map out the route.
