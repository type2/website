Which begs the question of how they became SOs in the first place!

&gt; So, do you married people have a limit to owning busses, going to shows,
&gt; swaps, et. al??  Be honest.  Eric and Barb and Philip and Kathryn are
&gt; the exceptions that prove the rule.

Well, my wife of 12 years had more VWs than I did when I met her.  She
doesn't seem to be disturbed by stuff I haul home.  She's even encouraging
me to get into antique tractors as well.  I'm more limited by real estate
than by my spouse.

Funny world... :)
