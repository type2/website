Driving in to work tonight my gen light came on bright as the sun.  I've not time to work on it at work.  I checked reg. wires and gen wires and all seems good.  Any ideas?  Should I attempt the 35 mile drive home in the dark (with lights.  Will my new 12V batt make it that far?  Last time I looked the brushes on the gen. looked good.  All is clean and in good shape.  

Thanks!

Steve
