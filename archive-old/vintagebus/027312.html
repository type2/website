I called up Hagerty today and they wouldn't insure my buses (my 64) because ..
1.  Its a camper.  I don't know why...it doesn't have electricity or gas or
anything like that which they said they wouldn't insure.
2.  I don't have a &quot;reliable&quot; daily driver.  hahaha!!  my 71 is my daily...they
think it too is a classic and if something were to happen I'd just use my 64
instead.
3. It's a Volkswagen....this lady had something against VWs...she said
&quot;well...they aren't that valuable...are they?&quot;

there were some other reasons too...
but if you're going to call them up...make sure you have yourself a show
winner....or they won't touch it...  At least thats the idea I got.
