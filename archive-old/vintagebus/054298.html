Subject: Loyalty and Reality


A while back I asked about my bus dieing at stop lights and received several
suggestions, and was asked to get back to the list with the actual solution
it had been discovered.

Get this: the choke was disconnected. I was working long hours and wanted to
get the valves checked, the usual maint., but I didn't have time so I let a
shop that was previously highly reputable do it. It went into the shop
running great (the servicing was just &quot;by the book&quot;) -- and came out running
awful.

This was a place where appointments had to be scheduled many days in
advance. What I thought was a contiuning indication of high demand was
actually inefficient time management on their part, apparently, but that's
later.

Waiting days for the first opening, I took the bus back, and when I got it
back a second time, it still ran awful.

I took it back a third time (more days waiting, zipping to my job on a bike,
not good in this town) (and by this time I could have done the job myself...
that was I what I was trying to avoid, dead-tired from 13-hour days with no
days off since the beginning of October). And it ran worse than ever, this
time with a constant smell of gas (which for this bus is normal only when
you fill up the tank), it'd do 20 tops with the pedal floored, always
cutting out, and then -- boom -- oil pressure gauge suddenly goes from 35
pounds (displayed) to about four.

By now I had spent some coinage at this shop (valve adjustments, tune-up,
carb rebuild, etc.), all because I of my work schedule -- with nothing but
risking my life on a bike to show for it, right at the exact time I did not
want to be on foot (or on bike), when the temperatures drop to 26 in
November, which was the whole point of taking it in to shop in the first
place when the weather was still 40ish.

Third time's the charm. folks. I had another shop look at it. They took my
bus the next business day, got my bus in the morning and it was fixed and
roadtested within 24 hours, running perfectly. The previous shop had
disconnected the choke. If anyone here on this list knows a reason why
someone would do that, please clue me in. The disconnected choke then
resulted in having to flood the carb just to get power (smell of gas), and
the gas got into the oil (hence, goodbye oil pressure).

I'm a loyal sort. I've always had that problem (witness my continuing to be
in love with the pre-67 Type 2 while all my friends urge, oh, for at least
the past 25 years for  me to get with the Madison Avenue program and get
&quot;something that works.&quot; My bus has always worked. I'd rather drive my bus or
a bus than anything). Hell, I'm still friendly with my ex-wife. Call me a
sap. My friends do...

But I suppose this goes to say that any shop is defined not by loyalty but
by its personnel, and if the personnel change, the shop may go from being a
god among VW bus pilots to some posing infidel out making bucks (at least
for the short term) instead of doing good. This shop meant no bad intent, of
course... it was just bad workmanship, bad quality control, and lack of
documentation and efficiency. Where I first thought it was cool that they'd
write down my work order by hand on scraps of paper, that lost its romantaic
charm by the second visit when no one there would find the piece of paper
or, worse, remember that I had made an appointment -- the one I had waited
days to keep while all the while being frozen to a bicycle seat.

It did occur to me, freezing myself solid on my mountain bike, that of all
the rave letters and postcards on the first shop's wall, none were from a
date &gt;after&lt; their personnel changes; every one of 'em were dated to, O.K.,
the 20th Century. (&quot;19&quot; in all the postmarks). Yet the letters and postcards
were still up there, giving that comfy, secure &quot;community&quot; feeling. But now,
numb hands gripping cold steel handlebars, propelling myself to work at
ungodly hours, NOW my memory begins to scroll through the testimonies and
how poignant they are for any lack of immediacy. Nothing from 2001. Nothing
from 2000. Huff, puff, rub it in why don't you.

This other shop, on the other hand, all documented by a computer printout:
what I said, what they did. A complete history of the buswork. Bus in.
Problem fixed. Bus out. Crazy world, ain't it? &lt;--Some of you might
recognize the phrase. But I thought I'd post this missive to the list as a
reminder of what's out there.

Kinda depressing how a good shop went from great to horrible, and kinda
great that another takes it place. For my part locally (as the names are
certainly irrelevant on this list), I'm spreading the word as to the
particular shops as fast as I can. In that sense, it's a small price to pay
freezin' one's buns off on a bike in the dark at 5 o'clock in the morning
when that the reason one is put there can be used as a warning to others.

Any other horror stories out there?

Craig
