Just what I need...more competition for parts :- )!!  Welcome to Westy parts search club.  No offense, but I don't think I'll be sending any help your way.  Since I'm looking for some of the same things.  I wish you all
the luck in your search.  I'll I can say is keep looking they do turn up, usually when you least expect them.  I go to every swap I can, but only rarely do things like lights table arms and cabinets show up.  When they
do, they go fast.  Know exactly what you're looking for, because some things like the latch handles are similar in bay window busses.

BTW there are two styles of side light.  What is the serial # on the brass Westy plate (located on the z-bed)?  Early SO-42/44 kits came with the inverted clam shell shade(up to serial #1049), while the later ones post
64 I think (from serial #1050), came with the 1/2 rectangle shades

Rack and tent??  Like I said, welcome to the club.

Congrats!!

&gt; Hi,listee:
&gt;    Just bought a 66 westy.  It comes without the interior lights, what-not spice rack and has one broken cabinet handle.  If anyone happen to have spare ones or know where can I find them, please let me know. Thanks.
&gt;                                                                        Michael
&gt; p.s. I am also looking for the correct side tent and roof rack for it.
&gt;      Thanks.
