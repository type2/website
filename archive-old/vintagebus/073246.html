I was kinda over generalizing the group, but certainly didn't mean to
indicate that everyone was that way (especially on this list). Plus I
couldn't really comment much on the western shows, all I've been to
are the eastern ones. So my viewpoint might be skewed toward this side
of the Mississippi. :)

&gt; buses I like!  ;) 

that reference took me a minute, but very funny. :)

&gt; Every time I make it to a show or on a camping trip &quot;I win&quot;.

very true.
