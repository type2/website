Hi John,
We also have used a hammer sideways on the drain/fill plugs to jar off the 
outer housing and bearing.  This results in less damage to the RGB half 
sealing surfaces.  If one has to use the hammer on the RGB half deifinitely 
use a piece of oak and still try to only hit the two areas on the top and 
bottom where the outer RGB half stick out beyond the inner half.  
  Once off we polish the areas on the stub axle with very fine (400-600+) 
wet/dry sand paper to remove any galling from previous bearing installations 
and make the press fit not so darned tight.   Eric&amp;Barb
