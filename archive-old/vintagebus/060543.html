Subject: redux box adapter kit...

 was lookin thru sum old Hot VW mags last night... and came across a Johnnys 
Speed and Chrome ad. In that ad was a &quot;redux box adapter kit&quot;... Now I 
realize this is for a B*g... but..... they offered 3 different kits that 
allow the use of a bus tranny with redux boxes on a SA B*g. Upright box 
adapter, Laydown box adapter... now this one is the kicker... &quot;upright gear 
redux box adapter with no hop kit&quot;  it looks kinda like a trailing arm that 
bolts to the redux boxs, and the other end welds to the torsion tube, with 
both ends having a pivot point. Has anyone ever converted a Baja using this 
&quot;no hop&quot; setup, and is there a such animal for a bus. My driveway is kinda 
steep, and takin off from a dead stop on it really shutters the ole truck... 
 Now if I could just figure out a way to keep both back tires on the ground 
during high speed corners... but thats another story.
