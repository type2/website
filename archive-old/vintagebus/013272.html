Another radiator suggestion:

I've seen a radiator mounted in the left side of the engine bay, with
the top edge leaned toward the center of the vehicle.  As I recall
(going on 4-year old memory), the memory was a stock unit from a
japanese car, but I don't remember the make.  The owner said that he
had just scrounged around the boneyard until he found a radiator that
fit the hole.  The air exited down around the periphery of the engine
which was left unshrouded.  I suppose that you could also seal the
engine bay and exhaust through the opposite louvers.

Two keys to a successful installation of this type is good shrouding
around the radiator to prevent recirculation and an effective electric
fan.  You're not going to get a lot of stagnation pressure at this
location, particularly in a splitty with flush louvers.  I've seen
several watercooled conversions whose owners cited overheating
problems, and their common feature was that the radiators weren't
shrouded and sealed to prevent recirculation.

I much prefer the radiator in the engine bay design, as it makes the
plumbing much simpler.  Even if you get a custom radiator made to
exactly fit the available space, you would be money and time ahead not
to have to plumb lines to the front of the bus.  It looks much better,
as well.
