Subject: Yet Another safari question
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10004031353360.29476-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

I have been seriously considering outfitting my 61 with safaris...

But i do have a question...

I have heard talk of an indentation in the upper window channel for safari
mounting plates... i dont see such a thing on my bus (but not knowing what
it looks like im a bit stumped anyway...)

Are earlier and later safaris different for this reason, and which type of
setup are aftermarket safaris tooled for... will i need to modify
something to get it all to fit right?

thanks,

Steve
