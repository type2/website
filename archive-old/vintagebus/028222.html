John,

Check out Everetts site under litature/camper section.  You will find SO-42
manual/s that show you how the whole SO-42/44 kit should look.  I think there
is even one with dimensions on it.  To answer your question more directly, yes
you do need the wood box structure.  Very similar to the bay window units.
About the only difference is some size dimensions and mounting brackets that
bolted to the engine shelf on the bays.   The seat sits transversely with the
left side sitting against the left side of the bus and the right side of the
seat/bed us against the wall cabinet that sits along  the right side of the
bus.  Look at the campmobile manual pics on Everetts site, you'll see how it
goes.  The seat mounts to the box via the brackets and the box bolts to the
floor seat plates.

Any way you look at it, you'll need to procure some type of mounting box either
make one or find a 67 one.   Believe me the latter is not an easy find.  I had
bought a whole bus just to find Westy SO-42 parts.

Too bad the PO didn't inform buyers that the seat was incomplete when they put
it up for auction.  That is E-bay for you.  Good luck.

Steve

&gt;
&gt; here is the seat that i bought on ebay , can someone please take a look and
&gt; give me some pointers on installing this in my 66 deluxe, i do not have the
&gt; cabinet that goes under it, nor have i ever seen one, my questions are
&gt; how is it attached to the cargo floor?, or does it sit in a box like the bay
&gt; window ones?
&gt; does the seat sit all the way to the passenger side, or in the middle?
&gt; can someone give me dimensions on the cabinet, pictures?
&gt;
&gt; thanks  for any help
