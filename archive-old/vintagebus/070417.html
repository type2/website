&gt;I was using a thermocoupler.   I am not sure exactly what it reads, but
&gt;I think it tells the difference in temp between the two wires.

The thermocouple itself is a junction of two different metals that
generates a small (millivolts) voltage when heated.  They get used in
pairs - one reference junction and one sensing junction.  Usually in
commercial instruments that use thermocouples, the sensing junction is
in the probe that you attach to the item of interest, and the reference
junction is inside the meter somewhere.

Tip: If you're getting flaky readings, check the connectors.  Thermocouple
probes often have flat ceramic or plastic two-pronged connectors and these
usually have screw terminals inside.  The screws loosen up when the cable
or probe are banged around.

&gt;as you speed up, more air is blown in by the vast speed of the bus,

Hmm... my Bus only seems to go half-vast.

Please keep us posted on your testing.  It'll be nice to have some numbers
on the cooling system.
