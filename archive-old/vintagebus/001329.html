Because quite frankly, I'm damn near clear out of money.  The local guru had
measured this case and said he detected that it almost didn't need a line
boring job.  I sent it off any way and they went 60/80 - the local guru was
shocked when I told him.  He said, &quot;WHAT!?!?!  That case almost didn't need
a line boring when I checked it out.&quot;

Because of being flat broke and having no extra cash to spend, I'm literally
stuck building this engine with what I've got.  I've tried to rely on others
for help, advice, and at the same time try to pinch pennies and I tell you,
it has garnered me nothing but one big fricking headache!  Sub-standard
parts being shipped to me, shoveling out extra cash that I shouldn't have
to, and massive delays have turned this bus project into something that I
despise on an almost daily basis.  Everyone tells me to build with the best
parts and I tell you, if I had the money I would.  I'm really not looking
forward to rebuilding this engine, and even if it does run when I'm done,
I'm not going to have the money to rebuild the front end.  Why do I continue
to work on it?  You tell me.  I can't get my money out of it at this point
so I'm now forced to carry thru with the project whether I enjoy it or not
or end up just looking at a pile of engine parts thinking about what might
have been.

Anyway, I'm fully aware that I'm cutting corners on this engine rebuild and
I'm dead serious when I say that if one more thing goes wrong where I'm
having to blow a big wad of money that shouldn't have been necessary to
spend, I'm just gonna get out VWs altogether.  A rebuild should not be this
burdensome - it should be fun and enjoyable.  It seems I'm cursed with bad
luck on a daily basis with this damn project.

That my friends, is why I'm going to run a hammered out case with huge mouth
gaping align bore, a thrust that is deeper than the case itself, an el
cheapo Barrett CW 69mm crank, a used set of pistons and cylinders, and a
whole host of sub-standard parts that would make any VW technician weep and
shake his head in digust and disdain.  Maybe if I'm lucky, it'll run.  If it
doesn't, well big deal - I'm still broke whether the engine runs or not.

Here's to financial burdens and rotten rebuilds...
