I go out to work on my sons Datsun 510 for a few hours and I get 90 Emails 
ranging from Friday Buses to the japan thread again... whoa.  We are one big 
EFamily with some buses!

But I'll bite:

1962 15-Window in the process of being torn down for resto.  Very little 
rust except right by the cargo doors (big surprise).  Just collecting parts 
right now and sitting in it with my Bourbon from time to time when I need a 
&quot;moment&quot;.  Slowly but surely.

1962 Panel with spun axle... yep... DPO was having a hell of a time with 
this one.  My son is buying it from me and we keep talking about getting one 
for each of the kids somehow and start a little club in Benicia, CA.

1964 Sunroof Bug..

You don't want to know about the other 6-cars around here... and then when 
their friends all roll in for the evening hanging out.  I should charge for 
parking to finance the 15's resto!!!   &quot;That which doesn't kill us makes us 
stronger&quot;... sigh.

Insofar as selling... ever hear that one about cold dead fingers.  Why would 
you sell?  What could you possibly step up to?  A slammed Honda with all the 
fixins?
