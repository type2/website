I've said it here before, R.Buckminster Fuller designed and built the Dymaxion Car between 1928 and 1933. The specs are amazing... 19 feet long, 67&quot; high, 70&quot; wide, 2,300 lbs., 378 cu. feet inside, seating capacity for 11 adults, top speed of 120 mph, 40 mpg at 70 mph using a production Ford engine of the time. Amazing specs for today, but this was 1933. Here's some links...

An Altavista translation of the above paragraph...
 
In English:  
 The 1993 presented Dymaxion Car were conceived, as soon as for it suitable engines available its to be able to fly also. As long as that was not yet possible, it shows good values at the soil: It traveled approximately 30 miles per Galone, whereby it could transport easily 11 persons at a rate of 120 miles per hour. It improves performance by far as e.g. a 1996er Minivan. Although it was not heavier than a VW beetle, the auto almost 20 foot was long and was so, large despite its extraordinary mobility, too for city traffic. It achieved a u-turn due to its individual rear wheel on the own length. The rear axle control, was however, so sophistiated it was to control particularly in the cross-wind with difficulty. An accident, for which the driver of the Dymaxion Cars was falsely made responsible, brought there project to the deadlock. Later Fuller brought ten years the realization into a much handier five Sitzer, which has one klainenMotor at each wheel. This Model had a front axle control, but over to deactivate, the wheels could be turned, and the auto crept like a crab into the gap. These designs exceed the today's suggestions about &quot; Oeko auto &quot; by far, only Amory Lovins HyperCar approximate.
