Subject: Re: [VB] Full flow filter on 1600

In fairness to Nate he does say at least 2 or 3 times he doesn't know the internal differences at all and that his comparrisons are based soley on a visual comparison. 
 
I was just asking if the filters you mentioned had a thick casing as that is a consideration for me due to my filters location.
