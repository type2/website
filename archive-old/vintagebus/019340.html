Well, it's going to eventually require some work, but it's probably ok
for the moment.  Long-term, I'd plan on replacing the pedal arm, and
perhaps cutting the entire mount out and welding a replacement in.
Short-term, I'd hit it with a wire brush, and if there's still a
decent amount of metal underneath, paint it and not worry about it for
a while.  If it looks like the metal's close to getting weak, then
definitely do the welding fix soon.  Unfortunately, there's really no
way to tell for certain without being there with it.
