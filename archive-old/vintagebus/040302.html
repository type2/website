Subject: Having a bus transported west to east coast

Hello all,
I have purchased a bus currently sitting on the west coast(OR). Although I
really, really, really, want to drive her home, I might not be able to get
the days off until April, which would be better weatherwise anyway. IF I am
forced to have the bus moved (a 66 deluxe, standard roof), which companies
can the list recommend? I am primarily concerned with safe storage during
terminal transfers, if any, full insurance with no deductable, and no
damage, and a good price would be just great, too.
I expect two of us to fly out should we drive her, and about 350.00 in gas,
so transport might be cheaper, a small plus in being robbed of a coast to
coast drive.
Al
