Subject: Fuel economy

I have been recording the miles driven and fuel guzzled by my favorite
beast. It's pretty rewarding to see that a few simple fixes really
helped increase the gas mileage

1) Initial : 17.5mpg (dec 2004 - march  2005) 1419 miles with 80.38 gallons
2) Torqued heads, stock exhaust (versus Monza), unplugged heat riser :
20.12 mpg (April 2005) 684 miles with 33.99 gallons
3) Jetted (leaner idle from 65 to 55, richer main from 120 to 125) +
Vacuum advance dizzy + right tires: 21.76 mpg (May 2005) 583 miles
with 26.78 gallons
(the right tires are about 3% taller than before, so with respect to
the former mpg data, this one is equivalent to 22.4 mpg)

Improvement : 24%

Thanks to all those on the list who helped me get there! The remaining
thorn is the overheating but it's being worked on.

This is with a 1971 westy,1600 dp and Brosol 30/31 driven around town
on 87 octane shell fuel.
