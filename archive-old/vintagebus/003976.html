&gt; I must mention, this procedure is for big nut boxes only, it's a little
&gt; different for the small nut trans.

Sunday afternoon:

Not much luck getting the ring off. Only moved it 1/4&quot;! Not sure but it
appears to be the inner race of the stub axle bearing..... The bearing is
coming out of the housing with the ring. Then I tap the bearing back in.
Bentley section H4, page 1 has an exploded picture of it. Outer spacer # 8
is the seal ring surface. However, mine is not like this at all. The ring is
not straight and parallel. It has a larger lip on the outer edge. The seal
has to be pressed into the cover 1st, then the cover gets installed. Then
the spacer has to go on last, thru the seal opening. Page 2 has 2 drawings.
The right one is 1500.  # 5 is the deflector and # 9 is the spacer. They
show it as 2 pieces. Not on mine. One piece. I have been hitting it behind
the edge of # 5 with a chisel, slowly walking the spacer along with the
bearing off, but only a 1/4&quot;.  # 5 is permanently attached to # 9. Otherwise
it would have popped off a long time ago!

Monday PM:

I found a puller that hooked on the edge of # 5. After putting up a death
grip fight, it gave up and slid off. Not sure what is up with Bentleys
drawings/pictures but they are wrong. # 5 and # 9 on this 66 big nut RGB is
one piece. After I swap backing plates I will have to install the oil seal
cover, then install the seal ring. The outer edge of it [# 5] is larger than
the seal opening.
*news flash!*
The fan blew the pages of my Bentley and lo and behold on page H4-7 is the
set-up I have. # 3 is the spacer ring I have. And I do have the roller
bearing for the outer bearing, not ball.
Jeez...page H4-1 could have mentioned to check page 7  1st to see if you
have reinforced reduction gears!!
