Subject: Re: [VB] Original color Spray Paint

I don't know if this is the place you are thinking of, but I recently
ordered a couple of paint pens one in Lotus White and an other in Titian
Red.  They have the paint pens for about $15, along with 1oz bottles and
spray cans.  I even think they can do Gallons.  This is all from memory, so
I may have some of the details wrong. I ordered the paint pens to do some
small touch up work on my '67, but have not done the work yet.  The pens
look to be high quality, and they seemed like a 1st class outfit to deal
with.

Hope this helps
