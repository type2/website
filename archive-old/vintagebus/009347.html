Judith Noah, the PO of my bus, gave me this book copyright 1963.  It's in
sorry shape but all there.  It's called:  Volkswagen Technical Manual by
Henry Elfrink 10th edition.  The address of Henry Elfrink Automotive is
listed at LA, CA.  It shows all kinds of split case tranny info (as in how
to rebuild one) and old VW engine stuff like cam followers, aftermarket hp
heads such as the okrasa setups, Denzel oval ports, EMPI compensating spring
for under the tranny, Judson Supercharger, and EMPI long stroke crank (6mm
longer stroke).  The crank shown in the photo was made by the Alfing company
in Germany which also made Porsche cranks.

There is also a section on adjusting an air regulator ring on the intake of
the fan shroud.  This is some old stuff.  I kind of like the old filthy
book - it steps me back in time far enough to make me think that I really
don't know a thing about VWs.
