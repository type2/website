&lt;&lt; I want to swap a small nut tranny for a big nut.  Are there any suprises

 I have to look for, or is it a direct and easy swap?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
Fairly easy direct swap for 1961 and later bus.  Earlier have to modify 
(Shorten!) 1964-67 E-brake cables.  Since you are doing this make sure to 
drill and tap the mounting bolt holes that bolt the RGBs to the swing plates 
deeper and then install longer metric grade 10 bolts.  There is just too 
little stock bolt holding the RGBs in place and after all the years of wear 
and tear they are ripe to pull/strip out.  After doing several tranny swaps 
and having at least one if not two of these bolts strip per tranny we just 
modify all of them to prevent this.    Eric&amp;Barb
