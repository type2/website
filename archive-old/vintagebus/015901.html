There's a lotta head-work on ebay.  One example is the &quot;oh yeah?
well you're not gonna outbid me!&quot; syndrome that happens to newbies.
It's a Fruedian, &quot;whip it out and wave it in the air&quot; thing.  Until
they realize they've paid too much for something for the nth time...

Then there's the &quot;that's more than I want to pay, but there's 7 days left in
the auction so I'm going to crank the price up out of spite and there
ain't jack they can do about it&quot; syndrome

BTDT.

Now I'm a hard-core sniper.  If I want an item, I *will* get it.
I don't buy a lot of stuff any more, but I seem to have fallen in
in with the rest of the snipers, so a lot of things I want to bid on 
jump hundreds of dollars in price at the last second of the option.

&gt; maniacally determined to win the auction at any price.
