I went the same route as Paul, I have my bus for fun and a New Beetle for
&quot;necessary transportation&quot;.
And for a couple of different reasons. First of all, I think of my bus as a unique
vehicle with a finite lifespan.
I save it for weekends and the days I do drive it to work are &quot;special&quot;. People
see it parked outside and usually mention it.
The NB is nice, but it's &quot;just another production car&quot; and therefore if it breaks
or gets trashed I can replace it pretty effortlessly.
I don't see the sense in pounding the miles to my work and back on my bus
everyday. Plus I travel frequently into Chicago and other midwestern cities on
business, and while I'm reimbursed for those trips, I'd rather not use my bus up
for stuff like that.
The other reason is the road conditions here in Illinois, which as far as I can
tell are easliy the worst roads in the USA.
Salt all winter to a ridiculous degree which eats the roads away in the
summer...great for the contractors but hell on my bus, which gets either salted
like a margarita glass in the winter or hammered to pieces by corroded expansion
joints all summer.

&gt; After finance charges and insurance and everything on that new beetle, you
&gt; would probably have enough money to fix chicago rust on a bus 10X over,
&gt; and install AC to boot...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; p.s. i only have 2 running vehicles, a 71 bus and a 61 bus. I live 20+
&gt; miles from work. I have no heat. It gets cold here. I have no ac.  It
&gt; gets pretty damn hot here. I am happy as a pig in mud.
