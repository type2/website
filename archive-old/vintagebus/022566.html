I don't believe in miracles, but our new 12v engine finally showed up
today, and it look sliek the bell-housing already had the areas machined
away to fit the 12v flywheel. I know our engine is original, but i think
12v's was and option in '65, is there a chance the factory clearanced the
tranny?  Just curious.  Jim
