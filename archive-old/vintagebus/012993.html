Someone wrote me off-list about an exhaust leak question and I just got to
rambling about some theory that Y'all might find useful.  He had questions
about what effect an exhaust leak at the head (not talking about the leak that
always seems to form at those donuts) would have on engine performance and
longivity.  Also he had a question about the &quot;wet&quot; test.

Here was my reply.  Please reply if you found errors!

Yes!  just like Radio Shack, I have answers!  Whether they're right or not is
a different story...

You mention an exhaust leak at the head-manifold connection.  (And right now
I'm not talking about a VALVE leak)  The leak, or the gasses leaking out of
there probably won't hurt a thing, since the gasses are already outside of the
tinware and highway wind will take them away.  But a little theory about back
pressures and such..  

Did you ever notice that dragsters have pipes on the exhaust ports (no
mufflers)? (One might ask &quot;why don't they just get rid of the pipes all
together - no back pressure to slow things down?&quot;) There are **two** reasons
for this. The **first** reason is because of inertia.  But first .. stay with
me on this one .. I have to explain about valve overlap.  

You might have noticed as you were rebuilding an engine (you have, haven't
you?) as you turn the engine over and observed the valve action - that the
intake valve will start to open BEFORE the exhaust valve is fully closed. 
There is a reason for this.  Think dynamics.  Think that air has a mass and
therefore has inertia.  Once you get even air moving, it takes some energy to
stop it again.  This is where valve overlap comes in.  

When the piston is pushing the air out the exhaust port, the air is moving
very rapidly.  The piston slows its travel at the top of the stroke, but the
air pretty much wants to keep going.  After all, the piston just got through
moving a WHOLE COLUMN of air, that is, all of the air in that tube we call an
exhaust system.  It just wants to keep moving because of inertia.  Well, why
not open the intake valve a little early so that the exhaust gasses trying to
escape can pull some of the intake fuel-air mixture in?  Wow - it took engine
builders YEARS to figure out the benifits of this!  Look at those dragsters! 
There's fire comin' outa them there pipes!  That is becaue those engines are
built with a MONSTEROUS valve overlap.  So much overlap that raw gas is
actually being sucked into the exhause port.  Regular engines are built with
juuuust enough overlap to produce the best efficiency, and that includes not
wasting any fuel by pulling too much on the air-gas mixture and having it go
past the exhaust valve.

But why is the length of those pretty chrome pipes coming out of the side of
the engine so important?  It's a whole 'nother topic, but it has to do with
resinance.  There is a length of pipe where the air will be more effective at
pulling on the intake air at a certain engine speed.

So back to your exhaust leak .. it probably won't hurt much more than your
performance.  (it could hurt something else - read the next paragraph)  That
leak acts as a monkey wrench thrown into the delicate workings of the dynamics
of that column of air.  Actually it (the leak) renders it (the column of air)
sort of ineffective.

The **second** reason for those tubes is that when you let off of the gas in
your bus, there is a negative pressure formed at the exhaust port, and the air
at times is actually sucked back into the exhaust valve area.  If there are no
tubes there to &quot;preheat&quot; the air, that cold air could actually cool the valve
too fast and warp the hell out of it.  Yes, your exhaust leak at the head
could end up warping your valve.  Small exhaust leaks might not, but I
wouldn't take chances.  A VW engine is a hot running beast and valve
atmosphere shouldn't be taken lightly.

Now, does your engine have a burnt valve?  It is not coincidental, by the way,
for this to happen given what was mentioned above.  The wet test, as you know,
is supposed to help you diagnose whether your engine has a bad compression
ring or a bad valve.  Rise in pressure after oil is squirted in there
indicates worn ring.  No rise supposed to indicate bad valve or broken ring. 
That is the theory.  But a valve juuuust starting to burn might try to emulate
a worn ring if the oil gets up there at the valve.

There is actually a better way (or a just as good way) to test for a bad
valve.  Unplug your high tension wire on your distributor, have someone crank
it and listen for that HISS HISS HISS HISS sound of air escaping past the
burnt valve.  It takes some experience, but not much.  Your 135 from 130
reading sounds like the valve is trying to go south - it is juuuuust starting
to not seat properly or burn.

As for those rusted on nuts, take an oxy-acetylene rig with a small (#3 or so)
tip and heat that sucker red hot.  Just the nut, if possible.  Put a 6-point
wrench if you have one on it and it will come off like magic.  Work it back
and forth at first, and then turn some.  Then work it back and forth, and then
turn some.  Trust me on this one.  You don't want to redo studs.  They are
never the same after they have been re-installed.  Well, at least I haven't
had much luck in good stud installations.  Did that sound right?

I hope I have helped.
