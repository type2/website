well, it isn't the throw out bearing- that makes a whining noise which goes
away when you step on the clutch.  This is a  rythmic thunk that slows the
slower I go, think is is there only not under driving load.  I am going to
jack it up and let it run in gear and listen, and figure out which (hopefully
not both) side (s) it is, and tear it apart.   I love gear oil.  YUM  :(
Maybe the side gears cracked or the big circlip pooped out or the fulcrum
plates died or I really don't know.    I really want definition.

&gt;the engine/tranny noises just mask it  Eric (veewee111) thinks it is not to

it

&gt;not be there.    It does not make a difference if I step on the brake or

not.

&gt;The fulcrum plates had been changed, to have less play, and I wonder if

&gt;Ps if anyone has ideas on that rear thunky noise please say so.



Sure it isn't the throwout bearing? Otherwise, when I changed out the center

in the singlecab for a 3:88 Rancho, I got a thunky noise from the right

axle. With the bus up on jackstands I ran through the gears and when I hit

third it started jumping around and clunking. Put it on the ground and it

didn't do it at all. Figured it for the new fulcrum plates. I had set out

for .006 lash as in the Bentley, but got .004 on the right side which was

supposedly acceptable. After 100 miles I put it back on the stands prior to

dumping the oil, and it did not do it anymore. Probably took a minute of

driving to work the oil in good. Van Bondo and myself changed out his tranny

for a 3:88 Rancho here a week or so ago, and on the advice of AZ. Transaxle

went for .008 lash on the fulcrum plates. Got .006 on one side and .008 on

the other. No clunkies at all to my knowledge. Seems to like a little lash

to let the oil in. To tight and it'll bind when the axles aren't dead flat.

So, if your rear is high or low and the axle tubes are at an angle, it's

probably the fulcrum stuff getting to know each other. If it hasn't gone

away after a short bit, you better tear in there again.
