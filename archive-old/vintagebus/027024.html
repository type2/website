Subject: Shocks and snubbers

Well,

I finally got off my ass yesterday, and on a rainy Southern CA night
went out and put on some upper rear shock mounts (thanks Brendan) on the
rust bucket '67 Westy.  This bus is so rusty that the mounts had
literally rotted off the frame.  After lots of noisy grinding, cutting
and patching of frame rail holes (my neighbors must love me), I welded
the mounts to the frame rail.  Not the cleanest welds I've ever made,
but its tough to get the nozzle up in there let alone a welding helmet
to see what you're doing.

Question:  I've been running around for about two months sans rear
shocks.  Would this have harmed anything in the tranny??  Everything is
working fine, I'm just paranoid I guess.  Also, the rubber snubber
mounts (the stud the rubber snubber screws onto) have also rotted away.
Any danger in  running with out the snubbers in place?  I don't carry
anything except the SO42 kit.

Thanks.

Steve
