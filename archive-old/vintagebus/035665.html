It has an ice box, above that a shallow drawer, and a formicaed counter top.  
A hinged table on the cargo door side can be opened when you are camping.   
There is a water tank in there, and a pump/spigot.   No I don't have a 
splitty walk though one, and wouldn't mind finding a nicer one for my bench 
seat westy (yes the walk through are diff than the bench seat ones, cause of 
the spare wheel bump).
..........................
so is it supposed to have just a ice box and counter top ???    if so  how

about one of those ???

&gt;

&gt; If you want a sink, I have one out of a 68 or 69.  But the splits didn't

get

&gt; sinks in their icebox units.
