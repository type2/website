How's about a &quot;stale-air&quot; bus?  You know, no fresh air
intake over the split windshield?  Oooops!  That
phrase is already taken...Hmmm

That's why I drive one of the later splits, 'cuz then
I don't have to worry about it.  I just say to people,
&quot;Yup, it used to be a bus, and I did some really nice
body work to make it into a crew cab pick-up!&quot;
