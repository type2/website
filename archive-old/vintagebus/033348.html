&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm debating on buying a *decent* 71 single cab ($1,000), should I save my 
&gt; money for a split window double or single cab?  (ie what do yins guys like 
&gt; better?)  (I would prefer a splity)
- - - - - 
if you want a 71 SC, and it is decent, that sounds like a very fair deal.   I 
tend to find that I would tinker and fix things, and put money and effort 
into it.  So if I really wanted a splitty single cab it would be a good idea 
to get a splitty SC.   

  I would like a splity sc myself,  and there are some I have looked at that 
are really hack jobs,  or that someone has put the fat motor in and lowered 
and want more than I want to pay,  or are rusty and no title and the wrong 
vibe,    so I am just waiting till the right one comes along.   Myself I am 
wanting a cheap beater truck, something I can haul junk and firewood etc in 
and not worry about it, but structurally sound, fairly complete, and not too 
many hacks.    I have spare parts for splitties, but not for bays.   Dont 
want no double cab or tarp and bows.  But its about you, do you want this 71? 
 Or want to wait for a split?

So how flexible is your search image?   You could get it and trade it in 
later.
