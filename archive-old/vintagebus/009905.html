Everett asked:

&gt;white pinstiping was factory-correct.  Is this true?
&gt;I've never noticed a pinstriping line on the original paint Kombis I've
&gt;seen.  On Standards and Deluxes, yes.
&gt;
My original Dove Blue South African-assembled 57 Kombi has a white pinstripe
a little above the waistline. Another dove blue 57 Kombi I know of also has
this hand-painted pinstripe.

I also know of a 58 Standard in two-tone green/khaki (I don't know what the
factory colours are called) where there are two hand-painted pinstripes,
with light green pinstripe on the dark green section, and dark green
striping on the light green paint below.
