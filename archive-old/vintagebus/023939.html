Subject: copyrights

In regard to the copyrights issue, I thought I would add my two cents. 
Since I am not an attorney, you should not take it as legal gospel, only 
a laymans opinion. But it is my understanding of the copyright laws that, 
should you violate Bobs wishes concerning his material, he MUST come 
after you. Otherwise, he puts his copyright in jeopardy (sort of &quot;use it 
or lose it&quot;). No offense. . .just plain business.
