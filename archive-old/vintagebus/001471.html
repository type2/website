Hello all,

I recently purchased some repop Euro tail lights with housings and they have
a pretty cheesy finish on the housing.  Should I get them zinc plated, paint
them with por-15 or rustoleum, leave them alone and hope they don't rust
away in six months like every other repopped part, or something else
completely?

Thanks,
Paul
