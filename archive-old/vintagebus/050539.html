Subject: Re: [VB] Type 4 upright cooling

Carl,
first off, if you don't want to cut and hack and have about 4-6 inches hanging
out the rear of your bus, upright conversion is needed.  I converted my '60 DC
with cutting a single piece of metal.  Could go back to stock in a couple of
heartbeats.

check out my pages
http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/crewcab.html
be sure and scroll around all over the place through all my pages.
Then, bring on the questions.
Scott

&gt;   I am looking at doing a type 4 conversion in my 65 13 window.My big
&gt; question is how necessary is it to convert to upright cooling?I have seen
&gt; splits in pics that werent and it looks like the only thing that had to be
&gt; reworked was the rear valence?The bus is going to be pretty custom so I am
&gt; not real worried about it looking original,and yes I will be getting rid of
&gt; the rgbs.Any advice would be appreciated.and please no comments from the
&gt; Vintage Nazi's!
