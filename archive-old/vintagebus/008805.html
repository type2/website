Subject: unknown cylinder heads

Hi
I found some cylinder heads in my stash today,, and they look strange to
me...
They look like 36 / 40 hp heads,, single port intakes,, but very small
intakes..
the head bolt webbing is out near the rocker cover,, whereas others are
inboard about 1&quot;
the rockers have the shaft support as part of the head,, alot like a cam
bearing support,, no bearing tho,
and the cooling fins  are sort of tapered or the one closest to the crank is
smallest and the next one is slightly larger .. and so on?
I can't get a pic right now,, and the cast numbers are too hard to read past
the forst three digits,, V W 111 - ???- ???
 I was wondering if anyone can help me identify them?

I measured the cylinder hole and it looks like they take a 75 mm piston
