&lt;&lt; I am installing my rebuilt transaxle today, when I looked in the shop 
manual it showed 72 to 87 ft / lb. for the correct torque for the redux.  box 
bolts.  I have tightened them to about 50 ft/lbs and they seem really tight!

Hi Greg,
If you are talking about the bolts that fasten the reduction boxes to the 
swing plate then you have the correct torque amounts.  Though we would 
suggest using the lower one or even possibly 65 Ft. Lbs. if you have not 
drilled and tapped the reduction boxes for longer bolts to avoid stripping 
the internal treads!    Eric&amp;Barb
