Subject: Freeway Flyer

Hello,

Do any list members have any recommendations on tranny builders? I am looking for the typical Flyer with 3.88 R&amp;P and stock bus 0.82 4th. Does anybody on the list offer this service? Any pros or cons of builders welcomed... Or any overall thoughts....

I will be matching it to a 1776cc w'dual kadrons...

I will have to ship to Ontario, Canada if that makes a difference...

Thanks
Eric
