Here's a link to NQ's pic of the rig at the 2000 BBB.

Third row down. Not a big Airstream, not the smallest either.

&gt; &gt; Wow!  That's a class III hitch!  I wonder how long it will be before we
&gt; &gt; see a splitty showing up with a big Airstream behind!  :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The &quot;Westfailure&quot; has been hauling an Airstream around for years now.  
&gt; Although I suppose it's not your 'average' splitty.
