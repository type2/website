Subject: Re: [VB] Tire pressures

&gt; Aren't the rating molded into the side of the tires when they are made a good enough &quot;suggestion&quot; of what the manufacture thinks the psi should be??

No. The only pressure rating onthe side of the tire is the max pressure
rating. Ive never seen the recommended pressure from the vehicle mfg to be
the max rating of the tire. Think aout it, look at any car and tire combo
you can find. The pressures are usually different front to rear and are
not either typically the max pressure rating of the tire.
Personally I would use the VW rec pressures that had been prev posted and
watch the tire wear patterns. Center wear too much pressure outer wear too
little pressure.
