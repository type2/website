&lt;&lt; I've got the old OP plugers and springs for my 1776 engine I'm building.  
Is
 there any need to replace these?  Are they prone to failure? &gt;&gt;
Hi NQ,
Only replace them with stock parts.  We tried the aftermarket replacement 
springs on the 1641 SP dual relief cased engine we now have 40,000 miles on 
and found suddenly we had 60+Lbs. per Sq. inch _at_ 3,000 RPM in outside temps 
of 70+ even after 15 minutes of running.  Went back to the original springs 
resulting in a nice 35Lbs pressure _at_ 3,000 RPM after the 15 minute warm up.
