&gt;$25 a wheel is what I have settled on. The range is from surface rust and
dirty to primered in DP40 and painted black. Hubcap clips vary widely. &lt;

 From my experiences this is a high price for a wheel...  Maybe if they
were
 16&quot; it would be reasonable.  I am used to paying $5 for a wheel with a
used
 tire on it.

If you can find some 16&quot; Bus wheels at $25 each, I will purchase all of
them.

I think $20-$25 is the price range nowadays for usable 15&quot; rims.  The last
one I bought was $10 last June, I considered that cheap.  The OG bias-ply
spare tire on there was a nice bonus too.  ;)
