You might want to call your local commercial awning company.  I had a friend
who worked at one and they maintained and cleaned everything from straight
canvas to the new hi tech silicone impregnated stuff.  I do know they used
alot of specialty cleaners to do the job.

How would one go about cleaning a westfalia tent?
I recently aquired one that's in physically good shape, but
is kinda grimy in spots, looks like it's just dirty from being used.

Thanks.
