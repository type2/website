I'd start with a real tuneup.  You can remove the gas by undoing the
fuel line that runs into the fuel pump and QUICKLY putting another
rubber line on the hose (make sure the other end is in a suitable
container).  I'd clean all the connectors in the electrical system. 
Generators don't generally go bad just by sitting so I'd be inclined to
look at the things that would (corrosion at terminals, check the
battery, that sort of thing).  These are things I had to do when I
resurrected the Tinkertoy (67 D-Luxe)
