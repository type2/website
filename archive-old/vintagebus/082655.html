&gt;if i knew what the right tool was to resurface em, i have about 3 older
&gt;PICTS that suffer from accel pump check valve seat corrosion - that area
&gt;is really easy to get to.

If the seats are flat, a metric end mill is probably the right thing.
Looking at the Bentley, though, they seem to be angled.

If the seat angle is less than the angle on the end of a standard drill
bit, maybe you could grind down the tip of a drill bit and use that to
resurface the seat.  Probably using a hand drill would be best against
the soft alloy of the carb.

Something else that might work... get a relatively soft wood dowel and
poke it in the drilling and against the seat to mold the end of the
dowel into the angle of the seat.  Pull it out and whittle the end of
a hard wood dowel to the same angle.  Then put some valve grinding
compound on the nose of the hard wood dowel, stick it in there, and
lap the seat.

Or, weld (braze? solder?) a wire &quot;handle&quot; onto a new ball, coat the
ball in valve grinding compound, and use that to lap the seat.

I haven't tried any of these things... just thinking out loud.
