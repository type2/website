Subject: Re: [VB] Seat Belt Installation

I cut a slot in the B pillar large enough to put a steel plate with a nut on 
the far side of it inside the B pillar. The plate is about 5 inches tall and 
as wide as the inside of the B pillar. 
Tack Weld in place, weld over the slot, tidy up, fill and paint.
I bought an inertia reel seat belt and mounted both the reel and the end of 
the belt on seat platform (wheel well). The seat belt end went into the 
original lap belt mount, and I made a large backing plate for the reel mount. 

Lots of work, works well.
