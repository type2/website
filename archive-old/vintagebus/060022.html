Subject: RE: [VB] vwpartsidaho?

I was cruising over to visit my aunt and uncle in Meridian ID one day and
saw a few bugs and busses out of the corner of my eye.... turned around to
check it out and found the people you asked about.  They seemed like fairly
nice folk... they recognized me when I asked if they had any buckets of
bolts I could buy... go figure!  Anyway, I've only purchased a few trinkets
from them and had no problems.

was asked:
Anyone have experience with this outfit?  They advertise a 1600cc Rebuilt
Longblock for $550 on thesamba.  CHEEP!

They advertise themselves as &quot;the largest recycler of vw parts in idaho.&quot;
