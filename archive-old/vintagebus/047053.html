Hi Everret,
No Problem, thanks for taking a second look at our Email from last week and
taking the time to write back.
  We got out our 1959 VW bus shop manual and found in section K (Fuel
system.), chapter K-2, page 10 has three images of the Bastard air cleaner.
Two of these images show the 36 HP style fan shroud, but has the rubber spark
plug wire holders that were used up through 1961 not the 36 HP metal spark
plug wire tube.  On the front side of this page two images show the removable
round generator with the early 40 HP style fuel pump with vertical outlet and
this page has a  print date of 3.59 stand so these pictures had to be taken
before then.  Wish we had a scanner.  Does anyone else out there have a
scanner, this page, and the ability to post these images?  Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb
