Subject: KP - walking in


*Fortunately* my busses/car are not up to par with Kelly Park and I will be 
walking in to the place, I think...   Never been to KP, can I park outside 
somewheres and walk in with my little red wagon?  Or do you have to wait in 
those everlasting lines you all are venting about to get to the parking 
area?  Thanks for any suggestions.
