Kevin, you are out of line.  Erin (NQ) has done a bunch to boost bus
interest all over this country.  When you have done as much as he has to
better the hobby, then you can critique his methods.

Erin's enthusiasm is contagious.  Without energetic individuals like Erin,
this list would be boring.  How much have you contributed to this hobby?

If you don't like Erin's posts, don't read them, plain and simple, but
don't screw it up for the rest of us who have benefited from Erins
enthusiasm.

I'm sorry for the outburst, but this old teacher hates to see one person
criticize another who is contributing so much, but maybe not the way you
want him to.

Too bad we can't see a show of hands from those people who have benefited
from Erin's message!!


&gt;Okay, I'm sorry but I have got to get this off my chest.  Hail to the
&gt;great NQ for allowing us the priviledge of seeing his &quot;private list&quot;.
&gt;I loved the part in his message several weeks ago about after he is
&gt;done looking at it he will put it up for the rest of us.  Oh, and if
&gt;you buy something from the list let him know what a great job he did.
&gt;Gee NQ, I know you've been around for a long time and go to all the
&gt;events and add alot to this list, but please, if your ego needs
&gt;boosted, do it on some other list.  Preferably nothing pertaining to
&gt;VW's since I am on acouple other list.  If I have any information that
&gt;would help a fellow listee, I'll give you the website address.
&gt;
&gt;Kevin
