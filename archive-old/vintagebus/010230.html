Everything on my site has been either taken by me personally, submitted by
someone from either their &quot;stash&quot; or their site, or linked to the site it is
from (if known). I did not walk into gallerys and start jackin pics. I did
my best not to have what Thom and Everett do, otherwise it would be a
pointless samba/VB clone.
   However, any photo I came across that said submitted by Mike brown or
Turkisbus, I Immediately stole and put up on my site. Why did i do this?
Well its because your such a damn good photographer mike, thats why.
On the truthful side,  If Everett, or Thom or Anyone else tells me &quot;put this
up, someone submitted it to me, but its perfect for your truck site&quot;, why is
that any different then letting people upload via an image gallery? Some of
my pics may be the same as what can be found in another gallery, and this is
due to people sayin&quot; hey great site, go grab my pics off such and such site
and put em up&quot;. I've already had people askin if im gonna put up an upload
gallery. Im not sure if I want to due to this very reason. We'll see.
I did say &quot;*most* everything you see will be new&quot;, but as usuall, cant make
everyone happy.
Tell me what pictures you think are yours and were &quot;stolen&quot;. They will be
removed immediately. Or I can put your name in big fat ass letters across
the page if it makes you feel better.

Thanks to for all the positve feedback on the site
Problems with netscape were fixed,  Any other questions/problems pmail me

&gt;Funny thing is I recognize about three or four photos that I personally
took
&gt;and uploaded onto various other websites.
