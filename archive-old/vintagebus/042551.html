well,

I have been following this thread closely, and thought it was time to put
my $0.02 in the ring.

My girlfriend and i ride in my bus everywhere.  She drives sometimes, i
dirive sometimes. When we work on it i'll try to involve her, but
sometimes she tends to wander off as the tasks i give her may not be the
most engaging... (i am too picky about mechanical stuff to let anyone but
me do it, that leaves things like tin painting...)

I would say that what kind of bus a &quot;girl&quot; likes depends solely on the
girl. Just like guys, some cant stand a rusty or dented bus, others live
for it. If you have no way of knowing what she'll like, just be yourself
and maybe clean out all the old taco bell wrappers....

My answer would be no different if you were a girl with a bus asking what
guys like in a bus.  There is enough variation in either sex, that making
a determination of what is appropriate in bus acommodations based on
gender would be useless.

An example... My girlfriend cant stand the cold so we bring lots of
sleeping bags to wrap ourselves in up front during the winter.  But, im
sure there are plenty of girls that like the cold, or are hardy and own
lots of warm clothes etc. where no heat wouldnt be a big deal.  But, my
girlfriend loves busses, so she's willing to work with the no heat thing
and is happy ot travel in the winter. (we went up to visit Issaiah in
20-30 degree weather, not terribly cold, but cold enough! it snowed a bit 
even i think.)

So, have fun and dont worry about what she likes so much. be yourself, put
your best foot forward, and all will be right in the cosmos :)

take care,

Steve
