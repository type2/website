I've been thinking about the reproduction thing.   There are 4 versions
of safaris on the market right now.  Is there room (ie market) for a 5th?

Maybe Dan's talents would be more rewarded if he broke into something
different.  How about westfalia stuff?  Seems someone is always looking
for poles and/or mounts.  I for one would buy a repro westy setup to
hang on the panel.  I think a tent is a MAJOR value-add to  a bus.
I recall at the 'rama where I had my tent set up, and it was the only
piece of shade in the whole place.  I was *very* popular in the show area
as everyone was ducking in to cool off.

Even if it wasn't a perfect repro, it's one of those things that's very 
functional.  Even people with originals tents could benefit - I'd rather
put the wear and tear on a repop tent than my $1000 original!  Make it
fit the stock mounts!
