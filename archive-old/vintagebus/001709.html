Shawn writ:

&gt;i also have years of experience of driving very old
&gt;buses around the country, some in states of disrepair that would scare
&gt;the shit out of most people.  Still, this experience leads me to believe
&gt;that your list is overkill, and a poor substitute for diligent
&gt;maintenance.

I rarely work on my own vehicle on the road. I do my maintenance at home,
using the stock from the bus, mostly, then replacing it. The parts and tools
are for other people whose vehicles, (not necessarily buses), are in such a
state of disrepair  that it SHOULD scare the shit out of them. Metric
wrenches work on Ch**y's, too.
