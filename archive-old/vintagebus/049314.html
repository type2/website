I think I'm still alive.

I'll cut to the chase and spare you all the boring details.  Me and the '59 Westfalia WILL be making it to OCTO.  It won't be 100% finished but tough tamales.  The NOS 36hp motor is in and has actually propelled the bus around the neighborhood a couple of times.  Tranny seems nice.  This was the first time this bus has been on the road under it's own power since 1976.  I'm going to try and at least log 100-200 miles on the motor before the drive down.  I need more time!!!!

I've continued to slave away at 1 hour a day, if that, to try and get this bus as ready as possible for the big weekend.  Family commitments have sucked a lot of time away from the resto for the last 6 weeks so that has been a little disappointing.  I've been at this project for 2 years and one week, fairly burned out with the feeling of an anti-climatic ending to it all.  Hopefully the burnout will fade away in time once I start using the bus and enjoying it, instead of sanding and figgeting over it.  Ellis, what's that clinic you admitted yourself to after the '67 RFH was finished????

Don't quote me on this, but I will never restore another vehicle for as long as I live!!!  Especially a camper.  Jeez what a PITA.  I'm so sick of the minutia of every little screw and every little detail.  It would be one thing if the bus came out looking nice, but it nothing more than a pile driver with a new paint job on it!!!

Looking forward to the weekend.  Hope to see and meet a lot of old and new friends.  I should be easy to find.  Just look for the hack job subhatch Westy without a tent.  I'm leaving the tent at home, I'm too tired to even think about setting it up.

Robert
