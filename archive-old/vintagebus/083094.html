Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Wiper Stuff

From dogsbody:

Thanks for the wiper tips everyone.  I'll look for 67 bus or 68 Gia wiper
arms.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

I am confused. I have a 66 bus and a 67 bus. The length of the arms are the same on both. The only thing
different between the 2 is the 67 has had the arms replaced with the 'recall' arms. What are recall arms you
ask?

The original arms are held on by a set screw tightened to the shaft, after you lift the arm up. Crappy design.
So crappy that they will fly off. NHTSA ordered a recall because of this.

The replacement arms are redesigned.  They actually clamp more than 3/4's of the shaft and the bolt on the
side holds it securely on.

What recall you ask?  [BTW, recalls ARE forever..... I have never gone to the dealer to see if they will honor
it......]
Go here: http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot_dot_gov/cars/problems/recalls/recallsearch.cfm
and in the box called Quick Search it says NHTSA Campaign ID Number: (e.g. 01V166002)
Type in this number: 72V256000   and click search
and you get this:

            Make / Models :           Model/Build Years:
                 VOLKSWAGEN / VOLKSWAGEN       1949-1969

            Manufacturer : VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA,INC

      NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID Number : 72V256000  Mfg's Report Date : OCT 12, 1972
      Component: VISIBILITY:WINDSHIELD WIPER/WASHER
      Potential Number Of Units Affected : 3700000
      Summary:
       THE SET SCREW LOCKING THE WINDSHIELD WIPER ARM TO THE DRIVING SHAFT MAY WORK LOOSE. IF THIS HAPPENS, IT
WOULD CAUSE ERRATIC WIPER OPERATION AND THE COULD CAUSE WIPER OPERATION TO CEASE ENTIRELY.
      Consequence:
       LOSS OF WIPER OPERATION WOULD IMPAIR ROAD VISIBILITY DURING INCLEMENT WEATHER CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY
RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT.
      Remedy:
       INSPECT AND REPLACE WITH NEW TYPE WIPER ARMS WHERE NECESSARY.
      Notes:
       SYSTEM: VISUAL SYSTEMS; WINDSHIELD WIPERS.VEHICLE DESCRIPTION: PASSENGER CARS; BK MODELS TYPE 1, TYPE
2, AND TYPE 3.

      That is 3.7 million vehicles x 2 arms..... = 7.4 million arms..... hmmm, I wonder how many VWoA has left
in stock??
