Subject: Re: Which 30/31-PICT Carb to buy?
Message-ID: &lt;37489156.EE88518B_at_praxis_dot_net&gt;

The 30 PICT-1 is about the best Solex you can get for a 1600, IMHO.

It adjusts like most &quot;normal&quot; carbs; no idle bypass circuit. You set idle
speed and mixture just like your 28.

This was the stock carb for the '65 1500 T-2.

If you like the 009 dizzy, this is the carb to use;&gt;)

&gt; guess if I can't find out anything more about this cheaper one I'll
&gt; buy from Ron, but at 60% of the higher priced carb, this &quot;30-PICT
&gt; Carb&quot; sounds like a much better deal.
