 Now, for some vintage content.  I have a '65 Sundial that I've been
 thinking of putting a T4 in.  I'd like a bit more speed.   I've also
 thought about putting the 3.88 R&amp;P in it instead, but that sounds like a
 lot of work, as there are no shops in my area (Indiana) that do this sort
 of thing, and I've heard horror stories about messing with VW trannies.
 So has anyone done either of these things?  I've been told that the T4
 would probably put too much stress on the redux box tranny, due to the
 increased torque.  Any thoughts?

perhaps you could read the archives on this, cause it is well in there-.   

If you get a big fat motor and have a low tranny, you have hella torque, but 
would wind the bajeebas out of the motor, howling down the freeway.  so 
consider the drain train  linked.  VW tended to have higher gearing linked 
with bigger motors.  Actually, this is common across car manufacturing.

get your tranny tached to figure out what you have (post at least 3 speeds at 
rpms in 3rd/4th.  do you have the big nut RGBoxes- your 65 should, but things 
get changed.

If you go with gearing higher than a 4.12 r&amp;p with 1.26 rgboxes, I would use 
a bigger motor than a 1600.  what freeway speeds do you want to cruise at?

yes this is work, the old splitties was not designed as a speedy vehicle.
