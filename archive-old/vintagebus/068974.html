Subject: Re: [VB] '59 out of storage help

Check the spark, ala Muir.   Check the timing statically, and the plug wires.

Is it getting gas?   Sure it isn't out or you didn't accidently pull the 
reserve lever to off?  Have a friend crank it while you watch to see if the 
gas gets pumped, or with key offremove inlet tube to carb, and crank the 
engine by hand.  

Could also try getting a can of gas and using a clean rattle can cap, dump a 
little down the top of the carb.  Then crank it, if it jumps to life then 
fizzles out you have a gas delivery issue.

 &gt; I'm getting my '59 out of winter storage and am having a hard time getting 
it
 &gt; to fire up. It started up fine last month. I think the battery is charged
 &gt; well and it just cranks... that's it. I hooked a jumper vehicle up to it 
and
 &gt; that didn't seem to help much. I was thinking I may try to go get a gas 
tank
 &gt; and put some fresh gas in it tommorow.
 &gt; Any other tips? &gt;&gt;
