Subject: Shifter extension update
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Sounds like a good Friday topic...

Still making a selling both the double and single bend shifter extensions.  
If you have never driven a bus with a shifter extension on it then you don't 
know what your missing.  These little guys really make it a lot more 
comfortable to drive.  Don't take my word for it though, ask someone who has 
one!

**New news** I will have a Type 2 friendly West Coast outlet in the very near 
future, price will be the same.

I have sent out several of both styles and have yet to hear any negative 
feedback.  If you are interested all the information you need is at:

Thanks,
Dan
