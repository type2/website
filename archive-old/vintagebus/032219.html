Subject: Secret of the Safaris revealed
Mime-Version: 1.0

Stephen White reminded me that I had left the list dangling on the Safari
rubber trick. I had said that a friend of mine has great success with a
non-stock fix. Here is what he (Russell) said...

I was driving home today thinking about how nice it is since I replaced the
rubber around my Safari windows. What I used is a soft type of trunk rubber
that I got from GT musclecar, www.gtmusclecar_dot_com Their phone number is
(909) 825-0477. The part number is #LP51-C. I bought 20 ft. for under
$50.00. I ended up with about 3 feet extra so you could get away with 17
ft. probably. It didn't stop the leaking 100% but I have more water leaking
out of my fresh air vent.(that's the next thing to fix) I'm very happy with
the results of the new rubber. I love to drive my bus raining or not. 

He posted this on www.sv2s_dot_com in the Forums, Tech Talk. If you have any
questions, feel free to ask him directly! I hope this keeps some of you
Safari fans a little bit dryer. I've seen his setup and it looks pretty good!
