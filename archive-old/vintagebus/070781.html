Subject: Re: [VB] new engine break-in questions

Which also is weird because I used this dizzy on my old 1600 that I pulled
out and it ran fine.
I'll try changing and see if that works.

Gotta get this thing going so I can make it to the Classic in a few weeks.

Thanks,
Dave

&gt; there ya go, try another dizzy. if THAT doesn't work, then you prolly
