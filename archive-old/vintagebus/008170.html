 Ok, since it's friday, let me get my collection documented.

 I own (well, acually my wife has claimed it for herself) a 1967 Poptop
 Camper, great driver, pretty beat up.
 Also, I have a '64 double door panel that's well beyond restoration, but
I'm
 going to try it anyway. Good practice on my new Miller Mig welder.  Then
 there's the 1965 21 window bus that I'm still waiting for the trucking
 company to pick up and ship to my house from New York.  Digging deaper, you
 find my 57 Ragtop Oval that's presently hooked up to my towbar for me to
 bring to Ennis, TX in the morning to drive around in. Also on the list is a
 73 VW Thing that is supposed to be sold for the last 3 weeks, but the guy
 keeps saying, &quot;I'm coming next week to give you the money&quot;. Then there's
the
 forlone '69 Karmann Ghia Convertible that I have for sale (project) that
 comes with both a '71 ghia hardtop, and a '73 ghia hardtop for parts. Last,
 but not least, I have a '68 bug that's going to donate it's rear
suspension,
 and transaxle for a lowered bus project.  Oh, and also my friends '71
beetle
 is sitting in my shop not doing anything for at least 2 years, but hey,
he's
 an electrician and an airconditioning repair man, and he helps me out
 whenever I need it, so it's staying as long as it wants. There's one other
 car that isn't presently at my house, but is here almost as much as the
rest
 is my friends '67 Baja that he keeps tearing up, and I keep fixing. One
more
 thing that is in the works is a 1965 Pop Top Westy that I'm buying mosly
 because of the Empi 5 Spokes, Full tent with bathroom, and the kinder
 hammock is all there.

 Short List at my house:
 1967 Pop Top Westy S042
 1964 Double Door Panel
 1957 Ragtop Oval
 1969 Ghia Convertible
 1971 Ghia Hardtop
 1973 Ghia Hardtop
 1973 Thing
 1971 Bug
 1967 Baja Bug (not here presently, but a lot)
 In Route:
 1965 21 Window
 1965 Pop Top Camper with full tent and the goodies.
