Being a bit removed from the novice, wondering what horror stories you
have on the purchase of the Volkswagen.  Something you forgot to look
for, that little old lady bamboosled you?  

Putting together a what to look for to save a bunch of time and trouble. 
Have it mostly finished but now need a bit of input for things might
have missed, maybe a natural thing to the expert and unthought of by the
novice.  Please reply to derottohaus_at_aol_dot_com of this address.  

Thanks in advance.  Page to go up soon.
