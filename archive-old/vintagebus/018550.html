&gt;I dont know why people convert from 6V. Some people think you can't drive on 
&gt;6V, that when you get an old VW you HAVE to convert it or it'll something 
&gt;horrible.   For the record, I did convert  a 59 truck to 6V.  People would 
&gt;comment on the truck, as they do, and I would say ya it's 6V.  I was told I 
&gt;could convert it to 12V, and I would enjoy telling them I had switched it 
&gt;back to 6V.  :)

6V works fine on my mom's '62 Bug and worked well on my '63 Camper.  But 
when I'm out in the woods and want to really see where I'm going...I'm 
sorry, but I gotta go 12V.  Not to mention that I like my tunes and have 
the luxury of running Xmas lights inside the Bus this year.  In a place as 
packed and crazy as the Bay Area, I want people to see my brake lights at 
night.  The last thing I need is major body work bills because Joe BMW in 
his M3 didn't see me stopping.

Just my three centavos,
