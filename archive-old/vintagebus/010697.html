&lt;&lt;  On both drives to Kelley Park and Sac Bugorama,
 my Berg temp dipstick would turn the light on if I sustained speeds of 65mph
 or faster.  If I slowed down to 55 and stayed there, the light would go out
 and stay out.  But driving 55 seems to defeat the purpose of going the type1
 route for lower Rs on the highway.  It has also crossed my mind that perhaps
 the Rs are too low thereby not turning the fan fast enough at given freeway
 speeds but then why would slowing down cool it down.  I've backed the timing
 off some with no difference but want to fiddle with it some more as well as
 check the air/fuel mix.  I'm interested to find out if it's the phat motor
 that makes the difference too. &gt;&gt;

It is my belief that there is a cooling curve.  Meaning that the cooling 
factor goes up with rpms (fan going faster) until a certain point.   At that 
point the heat generated by the motor and pushing the bus along goes up more 
with rpms that the cooling does.   Meaning that there will be a speed/rpms 
which does the most cooling.   This probably varies depending on the set up 
in each bus somewhat. 

 I have found that my westy runs coolest around 2600/2700 rpms,(~50-55mph in 
this bus) and higher temps at higher rpms.  It has a guage, not a berg 
dipstick blinky unit, so I can tell the differences before it starts 
overheating.

Found a similar situation in another bus which had a completely different set 
up (that one was lowered and had a big motor) - that buses highest cooling 
rpms was 2600, bus when the outside temp was resonable it would happily 
cruise at 70 or more without blinking.

Lower geared buses would seem to have an optimal cooling rpms which would be 
at a lower road speed, therefore if your bus had lower gears seems you would 
need to slow down even more to get that light to go off.

Had driven at different speeds on flat road steadily till the guage stayed 
still, then switched a couple hundred rpms and stayed there till the guage 
settled, etc, to figure this out.

would be interesting if someone else with guages would post their findings 
about oil temp/speed/rpm interactions.
