&gt; YES this is a common and very dangerous problem.  You should take a
&gt; hammer and
&gt; punch and peen the fitting in place by peening some of the
&gt; surrounding carb
&gt; body aluminum on top of the brass fitting this should keep it in
&gt; place.

Good advice, but I'd do a lot more to ensure that the fitting doesn't
come out again!

Pull the fitting out again, and clean it and its socket with spray carb
cleaner.  Clean!  Clean!

Take a flat file and roll the part of the fitting that goes into the
carb between the file and a flat surface (not the end the hose attaches
to!).  This will knurl the fitting.

Mix up some fuel-proof epoxy (JB-Weld, etc) and put a thin coat on the
outside of the fitting.  Tap the fitting into its socket and allow a
couple of days for the epoxy to cure completely.  You should see a bead
of epoxy around the fitting where it enters the carb.  200F Heat will
speed the process if you can sneak the carb top past the SO.

Reassemble the carb, replace the lines with new, and be sure to use the
appropriate clamps on the lines.  You can also safety-wire the clamp to
the carb body to ensure that nothing comes loose!
