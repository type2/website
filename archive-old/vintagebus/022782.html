Subject: '65 Westy for sale
Mime-Version: 1.0

We just bought a 1968 Land Rover ambulance to use as our camper for this
summers trip to Newfoundland. The '65 VW was great, but there are so many
logging trails and mining roads to explore, we decided we needed something
with 4wd.  So this spring we are going to part with our '65 westy.

81,000 miles, tent, roof rack, brand new Strictly Foreign new case 1776
full flow cw dual Solex carbed 12 alt engine. the camper in now 12v. We
have the original 1500sp engine, it ran like a top, never apart, but we
needed mpre power for our trips....new 27x8.5-15's tires al laround,
BFGoodrich KO AT's on the rear. Everything works, we did a 3500 mile trip
last summer without a single problem. has run on Mobil one since break-in,
K&amp;N oil filter changed religiously.  You could jump in and drive it
anywhere. New bus depot German heat exchangers......

I think we need to get about $9,000 for the camper. Connecticut here.

Jim and Ann
