&gt; &quot;Actually they were more gray, with a 25% gloss.  But the new
&gt; look this spring is contemporary American rust, with the hottest
&gt; new looks coming out of Washington and Canada (eh?)

haha!  they (one of the vw mags) called the mercury bus' (http://www.stanford_dot_edu/~rahaha/bright_rust.htm) look extreme.  i told bill that he was now a faction, an extremist.  he liked it!  i wonder if he'd like his bus being called a fashion plate?  probably not!  i think i'll ask him to bring mercury around for a fashion show this weekend.  mercury and the lunchwagen can compare looks.  haha!

in a Volkswagen you ARE somewhere. -Stormy Henderson's Dad
