Subject: OCTO this weekend

    Do to family, house and bus ( 1776 behind stock 1960 trans will only
cruise at 55), I will not be able to attend this weekends OCTO event. Being
on the road the last 4 weekends has put me behind with home and shop/store
duties and I will use this weekend to catch up. Sorry to miss it and all my
friends and customers, but hey what can I say. 
   It's friday, I still need more VW related jokes!!!!
