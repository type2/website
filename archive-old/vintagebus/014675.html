Subject: Re: [VB] VW Part Number System

The reason for the request is that I have a barn full of VW parts.  Just 
about every model and almost every part.   I would like to know were the 
parts came from and was hoping to find out though the VW part number on 
them.  It is just a curiosity thing to know what vehicle the parts was 
specifically used on.  This would also help in selling any parts that people 
may need.  Anyway, I was looking at info on how to decifer the VW part 
number for ALL air cooled VW models.

Thanks for your help and any information would be greatly appreciated.

Mike

&gt;re: chassis numbers....you are trying to find VW literature with accurate
&gt;listings of chassis productions by day/month/year ?
&gt;If so, what are the parameters of your search?
&gt;later
