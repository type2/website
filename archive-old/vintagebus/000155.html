Message-ID: &lt;0.3c8a0cad.253f21f6_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

To all,
I remember a thread a while ago about upgrading the headlight dimmer switch 
to new technology. Mine is starting to give me fits. I have added power 
relays, so the voltages are okay. The switch keeps hanging up too much. Any 
info on modern upgrades? Thanks
