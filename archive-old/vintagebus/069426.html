&gt; &gt; I believe Kyle Tillman has a set of plans for the

&gt; &gt; (fabricated?) for the Jerome raffle bus a couple years
&gt; &gt; back.  Kyle, want to sell copies of the plans?  I sure
&gt; 
&gt; Thats cool.
&gt; I would consider exchanging some shekels for a decent set of plans.


i have the original brochure for 'is it a boat' with all the specs for the vw camping car 33 and
vw camping car mosaic 22.  it doesn't really show a lot of the little building differences but it
lists the parts for each and shows by diagram  and pitures etc.  i also just sold a 63 mosaic to
mark lapriore so am familiar with eh parts out of the box so to speak.  the biggest thing is how
the floor is attached to the bed halves and fit together to completely seal the campkit from the
bus floor.  i'd be willing to share the infor with whomever can make the plans.'
