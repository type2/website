Subject: bus sheet metal

ok, here's the deal
my shop is getting torn down in a bit less than 90 days as of Feb. 1st.
We just got the letter.  The 63 needs to be done by then.

I NEED sheet metal asap.  Does anyone have a bus they are cutting up and
some of the stuff is still good? or did someone order metal and never
use it?

either way...here is what I need
cargo floor sections
rockers
inner rockers
drivers side floor piece

thats what I need...
if ANYONE can help me out I would really appreciate it...
if anyone knows of a bus in a yard (Karl? ;) would they be interested in
cutting metal out of a bus for me?? and then shipping it...

please email me asap if you can help

thanks!!
otherwise I'm going to have to pay out the a$$ for some metal and have
to wait a long time for them to get it in etc..

ps. Thanks for that floor piece Thom.
