I'm sure they would. My brother used to work at a place that did powder coating.
They can do pretty much anything you want. The more labor the more $. I don't 
think I would put powder where the tire goes. Just because I'd be afraid it 
would get chipped when mounting the tires. Then you may have a problem getting 
a solid bead all the way around the rim and have a constant air leak.

----------------------------

 well, I would like powder too.  And it would be nice to get them painted like 
 the original- black where the tire sits, on the inner face, then only Silver 
 White on the outside face.   So do powder coat places do that sort of thing?
