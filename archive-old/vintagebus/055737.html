I'd have to say that SK would stand for 'Schraubbolzen Kamax' or translated
to 'Kamax Bolt'.... but of course, this is coming from someone dribbling
meaninglessly over original hardware :-)

consume ourselves with each and everyday about pressed bumpers, middle
seats,spalsh pans, etc. really has very little bearing on World issues or
how the planet spins.  A lot of it doesn't even have any bearing on the
basic operation of one's Bus.  But it's a hobby (or livelihood) that we
participate in and enjoy, so why not get caught up in the minutia from time
to time.  If someone wants to spaz out about using original hardware (sorry
David, but I owe you a couple) the he or she should knock themselves out.
