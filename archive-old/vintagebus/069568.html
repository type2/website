I love the way he brags over the GEX-built engine, as if that was
something good.  Along with that, he added &quot;every cooling option
available&quot;.  Apparently, the rear apron and engine lid were not available
at that time!  Kinda important to cooling, dontcha know!

Luckily, the engine has only 1000 miles on it, so the buyer will have at
least a couple of thousand miles to drive before it gives out.
