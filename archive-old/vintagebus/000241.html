Message-ID: &lt;0.588e9865.255874a9_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Just got back from the  morning  grocery run to get a message on my machine

Deals Off !

I quess in America any more a mans word is not worth much , the seller seems 
to think that there is some other meaning to &quot;its yours&quot;

Back to the drawing boards......hey anyone have a cheap panel in Southern 
California to make &quot;furniture-mobile&quot;2
