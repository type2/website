Look beyond the words, VWoA is out on the prowl, what they just asked for
was you to give out VW based web sites for them to jump on. VWoA has been
out on the heavy prowl the last few weeks, going to VW parts sellers and
manufacturers confiscating any and all non authorized goods, threatening law
suits, issuing cist and desist orders. It's time to stand up for our rights
as Vintage VW owners. There are many people making parts for Vw's and VWoA
seems to want to crunch them all. Withhold the web sites with pics, send
them pics but don't guide them to the sites. Next they will be trying to
shut down VW Planet and them go after Thom because they will copyright the
name Vintagebus!!!

&lt;&lt;Hey,
I work at VWoA , and they want me to analyze the opinions about the
microbus.
The new designed Microbus on your web page is the first one I found that  
really looks good!!!!
If you have more comments and suggestions! I would be happy to forward them!

Well there ya go.  Sorry about bringing up this NM thing.  Im also suprised 
that I didnt get a letter from the VWoA sharks due to all the VW logos and 
trademarks on my site =) suckers

After the rains here in phx I noticed that I have a little rust forming in
my 
parcel tray.  Damn safaris!!  Anyway, I was planning on blasting the tray
and 
painting it back to L87.  I want to POR15 it if I can but need to know two 
things:

1.  Which Product to use
2.  Can POR15 be painted over and will the paint quality be ok?
