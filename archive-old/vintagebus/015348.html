Been here....done this....lots of times.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; On to the questions.  What can I expect to have to do to get this thing 
&gt;rolling, just far enough to get it on a trailer?


Florida is BAD about making drums rust (or atleast thats been my luck). I've 
had to make skids out of pieces of plywood for the wheels to kinda glide on. 
Once you get the van up onto the trailer, you can wet down the boards to 
make it kinda slick. I suppose you could even use a little oil to  help it 
skid a little easier. Get a heavy duty comealong or wench. Add a good strong 
person and it can be done. I have a crank on the front of my trailer, so I 
make it tilt the bed a little too.

Once I get home, I hook my big tow chain to the back and kinda pull the 
trailer out from under the bus/bug. Your ramps will skin up the yard a 
little, but its sure a lot better than trying to push it off. I had to do 
this with my 73 RollsRoyce SuperBeetle. It had sat for 14 years and all four 
tires were locked up tight.

Getting the drums off is another challenge. IF you can get the adjusting 
stars to turn, you have it made.
