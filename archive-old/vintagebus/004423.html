This is my story to the tee. I was also lucky that the previous owner did
not sell it from under me. I just bought a 63 23 window with no rust. It had
been restored roughly 15 years prior from the owner (of 18 years). I gave
him a deposit  and told him I would pick it up the following Monday. Work
had forced me to be out of town the rest of the week and I could not come up
with the balance of the cash until I returned. In the mean time he was
flooded with calls from people offering him over double what he had
committed to sell it to me for, site unseen. But true to his word he held
out and completed the sale to me. He told me the story and you could see he
was going to be sick after realizing how much the bus was worth. As a token
of my appreciation for his diligence to his word I gave him an additional
$500 and said I would offer it back to him first if I ever decide to sell.
It's a hellofabus and am lucky to be its owner.
