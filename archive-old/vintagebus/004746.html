&gt;window *glass*&quot;, making the M-code
&gt;&quot;without side window glass&quot;. Interesting
&gt;code (if the reference is right) for a Bus

Hmmm ... this is a real possibility. Cars sold in South Africa were required
to have a certain amount of local content, meausredby weight, to avoid
punitive import duties. All locally assembled buses featured locally made
batteries, tyres and glass. Maybe the full imports had local glass fitted to
offset duty, as glass is quite heavy???

If, so maybe we've cracked M108.

And S Hedberg wrote of M007 and M008:

&gt;Forgive my ignorance in all this but could
&gt;it be referencing  the outside  mirrors allowing
&gt;the dealer to add those?

Possible. Something I once read made me think 007 might relate to outside
mirrors, rather than to ejector seats, hidden machine guns and oil slick
generators ... except for the standard on in the back of all buses ;-)
