Subject: Sighting? Herbie Fully Loaded

Hey,

Went to the screening of Herbie yesterday. I think there is a high  
roof split on PCH (look quickly in the bottom left corner of the  
screen or you'll miss it). Anyone else see that?

I think this was one of the better Herbie movies - definitely got the  
kids in the audience hyped on aircooled vw's... VWoA and Disney owe  
me for the product placements though. ;-)

Conrad
