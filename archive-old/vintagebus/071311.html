Subject: Re: [VB] AH Case w/ Dual 34 ICT 009 Timing?

----- Original Message -----
&gt; Isn't a too lean or too far advance going to show up on the spark plugs?.
&gt; I get near white on too lean and a nice coffee with cream color when
&gt; everything is tuned in pretty good.
&gt; Appears that the plugs would be self destructing at the same time the
&gt; exhaust was reaching bright orange /cherry red.
&gt;

The exhaust gets bright orange because combustion is still taking place
during the exhaust stroke. This happens because the timing is too retarded.
To correct this problem, you must advance the timing, to keep the combustion
contained within the combustion stroke. Run too long with the timing too
retarded, and you'll be dropping exhaust seats in no time!
