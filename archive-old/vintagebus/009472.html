Subject: 61 SO-23 westy for sale
Date: Tue, 15 May 2001 10:04:05 -0700

Hi,
About 2 weeks ago I posted that I was looking to trade my westy for a sunroof bus, but had no
luck.  There were some people who expressed interest in the camper and e-mailed me direct
but unfortunately my AOL account does not keep old e-mail for more than 10 days and I have lost
the addresses of those people.  If you contacted me, please do so again at ztoa96_at_aol_dot_com
Thanks,
Kurt
