Subject: [VB] sorry on the use of &quot;overheating&quot; word

I do want to apologize for one thing ... I should have considered the use of
the world &quot;overheating&quot; a little better before I started this thread.

&quot;overheating&quot; is a very subjective word in the way I've used it.  In my
case, it isn't &quot;overheating&quot; it is &quot;more heat than I expect :)&quot;.  Which I
take to be higher than 230 degrees oil temp using stock 30 weight oil...
measured by a VDO dipstick sender and associated VDO oil temp gauge.

I have the same gauge (VDO dipstick sender + VDO oil temp gauge 12v -- all
new) in both my '63 Double Cab and the '67 Westy.  They bost seem to have
the same pattern.

If I'm just driving around town doing normal 45MPH spurts... I stay in the
180 degree range.  It is only after 10 or 15 miles at full sustained speed
you see the higher temps.

Anyway -- the main point is that &quot;overheating&quot; word has been abused by me a
bit.  It isn't like the engine starts spewing coolant or it seizes up :)
Just running hotter than one thinks it should.  That is a whole thread on it
own :)

Let's stick to the RPM topic for now...
