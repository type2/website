 Hey Volks,
 Well, I finally for a functional splint on my finger from my cleaning
 accident (sshh, don't read that to loud ;0)  I decided to go work on the
 '66.  Changed the oil, tune up and all the great things you folks wrote
 me to do. I made sure the engine turned freely after 22 years of
 sitting. All ready to go, I put the key in and CLICK, nothing.
 I climb under the bus to the starter. Use the old screw driver, nothing
 just a spark.  Hmmm.. same problem I had with the westy in December.  I
 got a new 6 volt starter and was planning to put it in today.  We are in
 the middle f exams and I have nothing to do today.  Wife's at work with
 the new baby, Casey is at school, The DAY IS MINE!  I laid out all the
 tools and climbed under the splittie and admired the solid under
 carriage.  Ok , let's get this done I said to myself..  Undid the first
 nut after soaking it with rust stuff.  That was easy, now to the engine
 compartment.  So far so good.  Then it happened.  The bolt kept spinning
 with the nut. No problem, it has happened before on the old '60 panel.
 Well after fighting to get a wrench on the head of the bolt for and hour
 going through the innards of the bus, I am about to have a fit.  Anyone
 have any tips just how to do this?  Thanks
  &gt;&gt;

take a pair of vise grips and attache them to the bolt in the engine 
compartment.

now take a 17mm socket and some extensions and a ratchet and crawl unde rthe  
bus and use the socket on the 17mm head of the bolt.  use enough extension to 
clear the starter so you can use the ratchet.

some earlier buses came with the 17mm bolt through the upper starter 
attachment, not the half moon headed bolt.

BTW, had you cleaned up the connections on the old starter, and where the 
battery ground strap goes to the body?
