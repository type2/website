Subject: Re: [VB] Pulley diameter math

Me too- I keep seeing references to the D pulley,
but it is exactly the same size ( 7&quot; ) as one with no D.
The only other one i have seen is 6 3/4 &quot;
My database is 23  pulleys at 7&quot; and one at 6 3/4&quot;.
Therefore, there are no other sizes !

&gt; &gt; I know there are a number of different diameter lower pulleys out there, but
&gt; &gt; has anyone actually measured them and know what comes from what, what sizes
&gt; &gt; there are?  Or, actually, what diameter is the lower &quot;2:1&quot; pulley?  And
where
&gt; &gt; are you measuring them?

&gt; I've been wondering about this too, so I decided to check into it. It's
&gt; even easier than the master cylinder math, so let's get right to it.
