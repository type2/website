 Today the last air cooled VW bus rolls of the Brazilian assembly line. No
more air cooled motor production. Article says they are building 200 Silver
Edition Kombis for collectors and that is it. Last one is going to Germany to
the museum. They are going to all water cooled in Brazil due to pollution
troubles. Says over 6 million air cooled buses were built thru the years. See
u all at BBB X. Vwhoward
