This how I do fix mine ..... by welding em 
with a (gas) MIG.  When they break I just
drill them out again.  For me, it's much easier
than trying to peen those big assed rivets!

Jut make sure the local area is clean so you can
weld with the lowest setting possible.

I touch up my powder coated 'silver white' with
a white 'rust proof' enamel made by the Wattyl
company here in Oz.

Sounds like a great idea.  Has Anyone tried to weld one with a low heat wire
feed.  I have the welder and was going to fix my clip in the next couple of
days, however if the welder method doesn't work I want to know before I get
started.

the idea of using a bolt and nut to fix the clip with.  again with no damage
to the finish of the rim.
