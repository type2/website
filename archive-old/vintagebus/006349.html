Subject: Talk about a good pre-weekend!

OK. I am ending my holiday season and starting my weekend with a bang. This
week I have found:
1- 1961 Ragtop bug.
2-82 Rabbit Diesel Pickup
3-82 Ford 4x4
4-complete set of doors for early 60's deluxe
5-Box of NOS and cool weird goodies
6-1945 Willys Jeep

I have been busy!
I am going to sell the ragtop and the willys to finance the Ford(I really
need a real truck-my $13000 4 banger just doesn't cut the mustard anymore),
so if anyone may be interested in these, please let me know. I am also
planning on putting up a small web page so I can get some help ID'ing some
of these parts. I may sell the rabbit too, but I want to try to get it going
first. I work on Diesels for a living, so I dont imagine I will have a
problem. The engine is seized, which I dont deal with much, but it seized
from sitting, not any type of extremes. I plan on pulling the injectors and
dumping the 50/50 marvel/ATF in there. This won't hurt a diesel will it?
Sorry wrong list. Anyways, thanks for hearing me rant and brag. Hope yours
is as good as mine!
