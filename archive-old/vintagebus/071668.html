Subject: Re: [VB] Full flow filter on 1600

----- Original Message -----
&gt; I was just asking if the filters you mentioned had a thick casing as that
is a consideration for me
&gt; due to my filters location.

I think I read your other reply wrong.  The filters mentioned are thick
cans. My personal favorite is the Purolator &quot;Pure One&quot;. It filters down the
finest of all 'spin on' filters. My filter is mounted under the driverside
battery tray area, and have had no problems, even with driving on
dirt/gravel roads.
