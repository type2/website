I agree with E &amp; B. I have seen many heat risers brazed up only to have new
holes appear elsewhere along the tube. The intake is cheap enough to buy a new
one and forget about it, unless you are low on $, then scavenging is the next
best thing.

&gt; On the 1600 DP engine in the 66 the heat riser has a hole in it, right at
&gt; the bend. I have tried many different &quot;high heat&quot; exhaust repairs, but as
&gt; of yet, nothing has worked for more than 3 days.

Hi Jason,
If the hole is due to internal corrosion then the same problem is happening
along the entire length of the heat riser tube, and once you repair it the
problem is more than likely to rear its ugly head again, and again, and
again.....  BTDT with house plumbing!  If the hole is due to someone drilling
it through there then having it welded is about the only easy ansewer that
will work.
