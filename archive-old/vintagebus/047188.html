Hi Tim,
The problem with the type 1 front and rear windows is that any water that 
leaks by the seal to body ends up dripping through the factory zinc primer 
bath drain holes in the body/window channels.  We found this out years ago 
after moving back to Washinton state with my 1963 KG that I had found, and 
restored during my years in the USAF while based in Texas.  Suddenly the 
floor of the KG was always damp.  Turns out once the water leaks past the 
seal and down through the primer bath drain holes it works it's way down in 
front of the door hindge pillars and sits until it either fills up till it 
seeps out around the lower hindge screws or works it's way into the heater 
channels, and to the floor inside.  Rotting the type 1 from the inside of the 
heater channels out, and fogging your windshield!  Thus the start of our 
experience with seals and sealant.     Eric&amp;Barb
