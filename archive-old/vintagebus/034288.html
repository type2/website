4sale 69 westy in ny
this is at the VW shop that I work at, the town is on our case(Again!) for our cars out in the yard, so they must go. This one is nice and solid, please save it.

The floors are beautiful!

Solid body no motor, needs a home. no title. asking
$500obo. must go this week, or we will get fined if it's still here. located in Tuckahoe ny

Call (914) 337-6100 anytime I'm usually here at the shop 7:00-11:00pm m-f and 9:00-6:30 on sat. We are on the AIRS list, so if you need any help, please call me. 
 
act quickly before it goes to the boneyard 
(I would if I could, but I already have a Diesel Vanagon in my parents driveway, and a 88 GL is going there next week to be converted to a 1.8 or 2.0(whatever I find first goes in it).
