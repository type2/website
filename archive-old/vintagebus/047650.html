Yes Thom ,Rocky is showing the gutter repair section,as i have been told they
are also offering some more new stuff ,per NBUSYGUY i found out that they
selling a rear over the engine deck section Note,after i just finished
fabercating a full width by 16 inch section of it for the 60 westy in the
shop,,,$&amp;%^#)),,wouldn't you know it,,ah life goes on,,i just used a hinge
post section for a cargo door ,on a 57 23 window ( the bondo bus from hell) it
worked real well and is a great looking piece,,each supplier has parts i like
and parts i don't,,,, but most is either personal peference or fit or the darn
thing just don't fit ,,some are cheezy and to light weight thickness of steel,
when at all possible i make my own parts ,,i know my quality when i make it no
guess work  there ,,,later
