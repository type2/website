Subject: 1st post; busted tranny &amp; engine fire
Mime-Version: 1.0

I bought my first VW about a month ago, a '67 van.  It seemed to be
running pretty good, except that the tranny seemed to be pretty
noisy.  Not knowing VW's, I thought that was normal reduction box
noises.

So, I take her on her first road trip.  Drove from San Jose to L.A., 
about 350 miles.  Got there, no problem, but then I realize that 
reverse is gone.  

Ok, I figure that I don't need reverse to drive it home.  Start off, 
got 300 miles and the line came out of the fuel pump.  Instant fire.
I hadn't bothered to get an extinguisher yet so maybe you can imagine
my horror as I watch what I figure is my van's last moments on earth,
just as I started to bond with her.  Luckily, a guy in a nicely 
restored dark green Ghia stops and puts out the fire with his extinguisher.
I've never fallen in love with a stranger as quickly as I did when he
came around the corner of the van.

Ok, get it towed home.  Start calling around.  That's how I found out
that '67 trannys are rare as hen's teeth.  Best price I found was from
an outfit called 'Carter Gearbox'.  For a remanufactured tranny, diff
and redux boxes, they quoted me something like $620 + s&amp;h.  Figure 
about $700.

I'm thinking about going that route, if only to have a basically brand
new drivetrain.  (PO says that the engine was rebuilt about 10K miles
ago.  I haven't done a compression test to find out for sure.)

Basically, what I want to know is,;
1, What does the list think about spending that kind of serious $'s 
   on the tranny.  Is there another option?

2, I'm also looking for a good reference for the wiring, vacuum hoses,
   fuel lines, etc.  I'm not familiar enough with VW engines to put it 
   back together without a diagram to work from.  I've got the Bently
   and the Muir manuals, but I don't see anything in either one that 
   looks super helpful.

3, On an unrelated note, when I got the engine out, I noticed that the
   suspension seems to be riding a bit low.  1 finger width between the 
   rubber pad on the axle and the cup it goes into on the body.  Is this
   bad shocks, bad torsion bar, or normal?

I'll have pictures up on a web site as soon as I can get them developed
and scanned.  (by this weekend)

Any help appreciated.  
TIA

Mark.
