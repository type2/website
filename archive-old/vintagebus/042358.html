hi all,

i have come across something that i am curious about...

wolfsburg west lists a fuel reserve tap cable up to chassis #614455 which
is mid 61. Same from 55 to then.

In the archives i found that low hinge doors started mid-late 61 at
chassis # 705619.

So does that mean all 61's with low hinge doors have gas gagues, or that
they all have a one year only reserve tap cable?(if indeed the gague
became standard in 62....)

thanks,

Steve
