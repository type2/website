All I can say is I've spent untold hours bugging people on the list and
getting greasy RAISING my &quot;rully bitchin'&quot; lowered bus. I drove the thing
for about 2 minutes after taking ownership and got into a wreck. It was a
truly horrorshow ride and unsafe at any speed. If you do lower it DO NOT
lower the front by pulling leaf springs from the front axle. There are safer
ways of lowering it with spindle kits from Bus Boys, but why bother? A
splittie is plenty &quot;kewl&quot; in its stock stance that made it a classic to
begin with. For more info, check the list archives at www.i405_dot_com

&gt;
&gt; I was wondering what was everyone's opinion on lowering your bus. A buddy
&gt; of
&gt; mine asked about it on a newsgroup and stirred up a big fight. So please
&gt; be
&gt; nice! Just want to know your opinion if it should be done and some ways to
&gt;
&gt; do it. Thanx
