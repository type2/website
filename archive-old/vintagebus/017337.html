Ok, just for the sake of learning....how do you flip
the ring gear in the dif?  I have the general idea,
but like the gear stack or other things in the tranny,
do you need any special tools to do this.  Do you need
to set this ring gear to any specs...ya know end play
side play ect.  Or can you just pull the tranny, pull
the axles-tubes ect..take off the side
plates...wooooop flip the ring gear to the other
side...bolt it together and voila!

Just curious
tds

&gt;  This is being posted for a friend as I would never
&gt; attempt such an evil mod 
&gt;  on my busses ;)
&gt;  
&gt;  He recently purchased a friends 1959 Goettls A/C
&gt; single cab.  This is an 
&gt;  early 59 which should have a split case.  He needs
&gt; to have it ready to drive 
&gt;  to Jerome as the bus hasn't been on the road in 25
&gt; years!
&gt;  
&gt;  Anyway, he has a spare T1 tranny and is trying to
&gt; figure out if he can use 
&gt;  that for the trip.  He already attempted the nose
&gt; cone swap but it didnt 
&gt;  match up at all.  He is asking for suggestions and
&gt; so far someone told him 
&gt;  (not me) that he couldd swap out the hockey stick
&gt; and use the t1 nose cone 
&gt; to 
&gt;  fit it in the bus.  I dont have any clue what would
&gt; work.
&gt;  
&gt;  Any suggestions?
&gt;

&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; you can use a tunnel case tranny in a split case bus
&gt; if you remove the front 
&gt; tranny mount off teh tranny and get an adapter
&gt; plate.  don't mess around with 
&gt; nose cones and hockey stick - that doesn't make it
&gt; work.  you just use the 
&gt; tunnel case type 2 nosecone for this mod.   you do
&gt; need the ring gear swapped 
&gt; to the other side , or you get 4 reverse gears and
&gt; one forward.   actually a 
&gt; guy I know is wrenching on race cars, and the car in
&gt; question got something 
&gt; fried in the tranny, and the driver ended up doing
&gt; the last circuit in 
&gt; reverse, including a jump!  but if you don't feel
&gt; like doing that stuff, the 
&gt; ring gear must be turned around.  it will the have a
&gt; low/bug/.89 fourth gear, 
&gt; instead of the bus .82 4th, so freeway speeds could
&gt; wind it out, but it'll 
&gt; pull the hills better in 4th.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; For help leaving the list, send a HELP message to
