As I understand it - they were purchased by So Cal Imports, 6851 N. Paramount 
Blcd. Long Beach, CA 90805 - the phone number there is (562) 633-9731 for 
walk in orders, and (562) 633-4979 for mail orders.

I havent purchased anything from them, but asked the same question re: 
Johnny's Speed when I was in there snooping around one day.
