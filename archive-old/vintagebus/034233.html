It is at $256 with 2 days left to bid.  LESSON FOR THOSE WHO SHOP VIA E-BAY!
The bidding thing gets out of control!!

Harbor Freight has it at $369 ...  I think I paid $299 for mine 1 year ago
at Home Depot... is Harbor way high or did the price go up or something?
Maybe I just forgot what I paid...

Anyway, I purchased my welder about a year ago... the same one for sale on
E-Bay.   The Weldpak 100 isn't a bad deal, but you do have to convert it to
MIG gas -- which isn't trivial.  I later found that Costco had a setup that
was off-brand, but already converted to MIG and came with a cart.  I think
it was under $380... making it a lot cheaper than the Lincoln + MIG kit
($100) + a cheapie cart from Harbor Freight.  Again, off-brand, so can't
speak for the quality... but Costco is pretty good about not carrying stuff
that people quickly return ...

LOL that welder is currently about 40 bucks away from what the brand new one
costs.  MY guess is someone snipes it and bids high at the last minute and
goes over the retail price......E-bay..whata joke.

&gt;Lincoln and cheap.  Small, electric.  Maybe in your price range if you are
still looking.
