Subject: RE: [VB] Look what I found!

Speaking of finds... last night I was separating washers in to three
buckets; split, wavy, and flat... and I found 2 of the original beveled
~12mm in diameter beveled edge washers for the 8mm safari window wing
bolts... I was elated to say the least leaving me only two to grub for
at Bad Camberg!!!  (or does any one on this list have two to spare?)

Bart found a cool logo on and old piece of foam:

Just thought I would share that.  I've been reuphosltering my seats.
All of 
the foam cushions have markings on them, but that one is the coolest.
It's 
the rear cushion of the jumpseat.
