visit this website for info about titles. for 140 dollars they will send you
a perfectly clean and legit title, as there is some loophole they can slide
through in their state to get it. I am currently awaiting my title back from
them and I know others who have went through them with no probs.

&gt;I have a bus with no title or registration.
&gt;How can I get it titled?
&gt;I live in Wa. state and the bus has Ca. plates.
&gt;It's been sitting for 15 years and nobody know who owned it last.
&gt;Can I take the title and ID plates from a junk bus or will I go to Jail?
&gt;It's a good bus but if it's a hassle to title I will use it for parts.
&gt;Thanks!
