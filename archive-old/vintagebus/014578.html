In a message dated 98-07-09 20:37:56 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; 
 1. How common of an occurance is this?  The truck was a '62 and the
 brake cylinders had been replaced the year before.&gt;&gt;
      This is getting more and more common due to the age of the VWs we are
working on.  Unless folks get to the point of replacing every five to ten
years all of the brake system including the metal lines that are getting more
and more corrosion inside of them every year.
 
 &lt;&lt;2. Is it possible/wise/etc to convert the single circuit brake system to
 a dual circuit as found in the '67 and later buses?&gt;&gt;
        Yes you can install a 1972 and later master cylinder with either a
1967 only, or a rabbit master cylinder resivoir.  The only cutting you have to
do to your bus is the push rod and the housing it threads into needs to be
shortened.  It all works alot better to make a spacer of about 1/4&quot; thick to
go between the MC and the mounting bracket so you have enough room to adjust
the push rod later.  Also you need to T-fit the two front brake lines into one
metal line to go into the lower outlet in the MC and move the brake sender
there to the upper hole.
&lt;&lt; 3. Has anybody ever done this? Comments?&gt;&gt;
       We have run our 1960 panel for over 20,000 miles with this set up and
so far it works great, plus it gives one a little security knowing that if
something goes wrong that at least 50% of the brakes will be there instead of
none.  Still we remove, inspect, clean, polish, the master and wheel cylinders
every time we replace the brake shoes or every two years, which ever comes
first.  We also do this to VWs that we have just bought or got out of storage
of more than 6 months.  Plus doing this also automaticlly gets rid of old
contaminated brake fluid.  
 &lt;&lt;I checked the archives/sermons and could only find an entry from Bob H.
 regarding the retrofiting of single circuit master cylinder into a '67
 bus, the opposite direction that I'm inquiring about.&gt;&gt;
 
 Thanks, Scott
