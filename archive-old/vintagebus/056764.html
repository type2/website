&gt; Are synchronizers brass or bronze? If they were, wouldn't those little fins
&gt; on the mating surface with the gear would wear-out after 10 or 12 shifts,
&gt; regardless of the type of lube?

Hi Steve,
Nope!  Only when abused with really snappy shoving gear shifting or badly 
adjusted clutch and since they only work to get the two gear to the same RPM 
in a few moments.  
  Here below is some of the info from aforementioned Anchor Bronze &amp;Metals, 
Inc. website:
http://www.anchorbronze_dot_com/gearbronze.htm

&gt; In all cases, the steel surfaces are harder than the bronze surfaces. The 
&gt; selection of the bronze to steel combination is based on the same principle 
&gt; relating to bronze sleeve bearings mated with harder steel shafts.

Bronze to steel results in sacrificial wear of the bronze and little or no 
wear of the steel.
Bronze to steel results in much lower friction forces than with steel to 
steel.
At high relative surface speeds, full film or hydrodynamic lubrication will 
separate the steel to steel pair, but at lower speeds, the asperities 
(surface roughness) of the mating parts contact each other. This results in 
severe wear of both steel parts. With the bronze to steel pair, the stronger 
steel asperities shear of the weaker bronze asperities.
&gt; As a result of these considerations, metallurgical and mechanical engineers 
&gt; have developed a series of bronze alloys that minimize wear of the bronze 
&gt; while providing all the benefits of the bronze to steel pair.

&gt; The desired bronze would have the following properties:

Strength to withstand the required loads.
Low coefficient of friction against steel.
Minimum wear of the bronze.
