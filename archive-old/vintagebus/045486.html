Sorry for the late post......I was at this show pretty cool.....we we're in
the neighborhood on the way to Wolfsburg, and checking out other local
sights......I picked up some pretty cool toys....all around was interesting
seeing how the Germans did it.....Had to have my wife and father-in-law
translate for me.........The bus that sticks in my mind the most was the
white and turquoise kombi with the PERFECTLY intact interior with the no
middle seat option........
