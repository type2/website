Subject: Fallen in love, with a model ... seeking Double Cab
Date: Wed, 5 Aug 1998 20:08:53 -0700 

I need your help finding a split Double Cab to purchase.

Ok, I'm playing the sympathy thing on two fronts.  As the list archives
host... I'm pulling the &quot;favor thing&quot; -- and I'm suffering from lost
love.  The favor -- if you see what I'm looking for, help me locate it
and help me evaluate.  Especially if this is a long distance purchase
from Oregon or California.

It all started Saturday July 25th ... listee Jeff Schwaia put his
original condition California '63 Double Cab up for sale...
 http://www.ns_dot_net/~schwaia/vw/index.htm
I made the offer, I fell in love.  Ready to sell my '72 bug and go all
bus!  Worked out a deal with Todd Hill in Olympia to do the tranny.
Just as I was sailing high, the deall fell through.  Monday, Jeff
learned that his opportunity to purchase a house isn't working out.
Although I was first to respond to his for sale, and we were in final
negotiation... Jeff had to make the decision to not sell his bus.

Hence, I have that lost love feeling, still feeling hurt and lonely.
What did I do wrong?  Didn't like me being from out of down?  Wear the
wrong shoes?  Bad breath?

I'm almost over it... and as part of the healing I've realized I didn't
fall in love with Jeff's '63, I fell in love with the Model!  A double
cab / crew cab (same thing, right?) is what I'm after.  Split window,
'67 or earlier.

What I want is the desire of all VW seekers... perfect body.

  1) Stock body and interior.  Best possible body, minimal rust and
dents.  Obviously rust-free original condition is better than one with a
lot of replacement panels and welding.
  2) Engine:    no concern.  See #1.  Will provide my own engine if
needed.  My goal is to put a 1600DP in, so &quot;stock&quot; engine isn't an issue
to me.  However, I do apprecite the value of stock engine and if the
candidate has one -- I will take it and store away for future.
  3) Tranny:  even willing to get a tranny repaired.  See #1.  I am
planning on getting re-geard for better highway speed anyway.  So 4th
gear pop-out problem is acceptable.
  4) I intend to make this a daily driver -- history of brakes,
steering, and so forth are all of concern.

Price range?  $3500 or under.  Also willing to spend around $400 to get
it here. (California, Oregon, etc.)  Will go $3900 if the engine is
solid and tranny is perfect... just don't forget #1 -- best possible
body for money.

I know I'm asking a lot... but in my review of Jeff's '63, I contacted
other listees and and helped value a split Double Cab.  Others have told
me that this is the price and condition I can get if I look long and
hard.  Hence, why I'm asking for listee help.

I'm in Seattle area.  Willing to sell my daily driver '72 bug and go all
Bus!  Can you help me find her?  Thanks.
