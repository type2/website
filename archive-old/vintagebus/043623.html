Welp, if anyone on the list is in the parts business I have saved up what
I think is enough cash to buy *ALL* new body rubber, including turn
signal seals and some misc niggly bits. Obviously I don't want to overly
skimp out here. I've seen some 'kits' online including pieces A through J
kind of thing but no pricing.

Anyone care to quote me on all new rubber? I can pmail my hopefully
complete list of the bits I'm looking for to install on my '59 panel.
