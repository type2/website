Subject: Das Klassic vs uj

After my hip replacement --as of this date I'm just three weeks into my six weeks of
spending my time in a Walker--I'm really pushing Magoo on letting me go to Das Klassic
weekend--Because of the type of hip replacement i had done--a &quot;non-cemented&quot; type--I have
been warned to go very lightly on the leg--No more then 15lbs of pressure--no driving or
walking --not even with a cane--I have never missed a Classic--But this one i just do not
know?--Magoo wants to drive out and do the VW Toy Show by herself!! If anyone can do it
Magoo can--But i just cannot let her drive out by herself --  do the Toy Show and then
drive back--My new toy in the garage is a 1960DC--68,000 miles in Sealing Wax Red--Many
thanks to Everett Barnes!!--Magoo and i and a few friends have managed to put in the wood
slats--replace a vent window lock--windshield--Pop-out window rubber--and Magoo detailed
the headlight buckets--What a Wife!! The DC still has very nice original SWR paint on the
inside--The outside is done in primer--but the primer is very close to SWR--bumpers and
wheels powder coated--Because of the year--The side gates were cut down from SC gates at
the VW factory to fit a DC--the wield marks are very neat--
As of now i cannot even get into a VW bus--or our Ch*vy Ast*o-- that is our means of VW
Toy Travel.cross country--If you can drive your VW Bus--you have no idea how lucky you
are--as all i can do is Look at mine--And it is driving me bonkers!--I have got to get to
that OCTO show and inhale all those splitties--But Magoo has said No--so far at least.
--But I still have time to figure how i can get in and out of the Van--hopefully if i do
&quot;cheat&quot; and do the trip--i will not mess anything up--Anyway--have fun out there and drive
and enjoy your VW Bus--Sooner or later that new old 60 DC--Bessie the Hippy Van--and the
63 23 will be on the road again--The 60DC is really ready as i have already installed the
color coordinated Fuzzy Dice!!  How anyone can drive anything, without matching Fuzzy
Dice, is beyond me!!
Hey! Enjoy your bus--that's what it is all about! Bless all of You!!!!TWWM, uj
