&gt;&gt;  and is bus tin and beetle tin for a 1600 sp - identical?  &lt;&lt;


Hi John,
Pretty much yes, and some no.  Most pieces can be mixed and  matched 
together, others can not.  The rear two pieces of tin around  the lower pulley must be 
matched to each other!  1300, 1500, &amp;  1600 SP tin can be used on either bug 
or bus on any of those size  engines.  As already mentioned the 1968-71 bus 
front tin can not be used on  bug or pre-1968 bus, without modification.
  Best online info on the engine tin is in the online bus part  manual _at_
