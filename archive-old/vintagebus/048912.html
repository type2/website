Subject: Converting 15 Window to 23 Window

I doubt Joe F. will sell me his roof clip off of his 21(23?) Window.  I recently was the proud purchaser of the 15 Window Deluxe that Erin Lassley posted about several weeks ago in the Midwest.  I still don't have it yet, can't seem to find reasonable trucking, but working on it.

After reading Joe's post, I started thinking it would be cool to convert the bus into a 23 Window.  Common thought I'm sure.  I figured I'd just graft on a whole new roof section, but then I started thinking it would probably be easier to cut out both of the 4 skylight sections on each side and graft those in.  Seems a lot simpler.

Any ideas or experiences with this?  Anyone have a roof section or skylight sections laying around creating a tripping hazard?

Robert
