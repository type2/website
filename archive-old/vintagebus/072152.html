&gt; In all the cheerleading for viewpoints, variously, of Ayn Rand and Noam
Chomsky, I'm kinda surprised no one has mentioned the little-known TRUE
&gt; history behind the development of the Type2.
&gt;
&gt; Of course, the basic running gear is widely believed to have been spawned
as a National &quot;Socialist&quot; (really fascist, read corporatist) PR ploy, then
&gt; resurrected postwar by the Labor Brits as workfare, only later becoming a
true Aktiengesellschaft shadetree umbrella benevolent paternal organization
&gt; in the model of Standard Oil and Enron, employing a great many Turkischer
Gastarbeiters.
&gt;
&gt; The bus itself is supposedly a result of the factory mule vehicle - a
product of Heroic Worker Ingenuity (which has given us such boons as the
&gt; Trabant) - admixed with a hefty dose of potential-profit-eyeing by Herr
Pon, a salesman (and salesmen never sell us anything we don't need, nor do
&gt; their minions create the need, despite the alarums of pointy-headed
academes and their silly notions, such as particle physics and nukuler
medicine).
&gt;
&gt; With the above in mind, one would certainly argue for the Bus as a
standard and exemplar of the Cryptosocialistic Laissez-Faire Venture Fascist
&gt; Welfare State, and damn your eyes if you disagree.  However, as cogently
argued on the list, the poor vehicle was adopted by a nation of overfed
&gt; longhaired draft-dodging ingrates (who got that way primarily from
cannabis, it seems, due to their rejection of Ethyl Alcohol, whose effects
are more
&gt; carefully documented).
&gt;
&gt; A valid point is raised that these Bohemians (transcendentalists,
pioneers, Thoreau-niks, whatever), in their rejection of Modren Culcha
[salaam],
&gt; drove around in a Machine!  What hypocrisy!  One produced by a bidness, to
boot!  Resulting in all manner of subsequent annoyance to perfectly
&gt; decent cleancut folk who want no annoyance of peace signs and dope
solicitation as they go about their -- whatever they go about, we dasn't
ask.
&gt; Which therefore (and clearly) invalidates the entire so-called
Counterculcha, QED.  Reductio ad fashionstatement.
&gt;
&gt; The point, you ask?  Dast you?  I urge you to remember that without Taft,
we'd have no Teapot Dome.  Without bidness, we'd have to find
&gt; something other than VW buses to represent what we think of as some of the
less obnoxious manifestations of Car Culcha.  We'd in fact have no
&gt; cars.  And that would suck, because we'd be bumming rides all the time.
