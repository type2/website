The earliest reference I found to having 12V pre the 67 model year  (short
look) was 6th April 63.     It may well have been available earlier, but I
don't know.  Sounds like an interesting book with pictures:)

was writ:

From the 1964 Clymers Manual Transporter Owner's Handbook (covers all
commercial vehicles) 3rd Edition (includes 1500 engine).

 It references 12V being available in Emergency vehicles (Ambulances and
Firewagens) prior to 1960...

 My '63 Standard Microbus (production date May 31st, 1963) has M-codes
for both 12V and 1500sp...

 Now I know that Clymers were never 100% accurate, but this manual has
more info about early Transporter/Commercial vehicles than many other
more recent publications...
