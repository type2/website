Well, since these are definately 1/3 2/3 seats comin out of this donaor bus,
i'll assume they came from a later model.  Anyway, i'll ask this then..  Are
all 1/3 2/3 seats the same?

59 buses never got a 1/2 2/3, they got full bench or walk through.

&lt;&lt;  After months of riding in
 discomfort Ive finally found some suitable donor seats for my 64
sundial
 (1/3 2/3).  My question is whether they will fit.  They are coming from
a 59
 (1/3 2/3).  Does anyone know if i'll have a problem with this.  &gt;&gt;
