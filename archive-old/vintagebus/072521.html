Howdy Y'all,
This will be the last reminder sent for the Third

is put on by the Ohio Valley Tribe of the Full Moon

campground, door prizes, and of course the World
Famous Full Moon Bus club Breakfast Burritos.
Here is the official web site link:

We are expecting folks from as far away as Maryland,
New York, and Canada, as well as many people from the
immediate surrounding states. Come on out and
experience some of that Good Ole' Midwestern Hospitality.

=====
