&gt; This weekend I decided to re-grease my sticky accelerator cable in my 67'
&gt; tranny case.  Is there supposed to be any tube or flexible housing that runs
&gt; from the end of the accelerator cable tube to the tube that runs through the
&gt; fan shroud?  I checked the manuals and the parts guide but couldn't find
&gt; anything.  thanks...

I put up with the notched tranny accelarator cable syndrome for years. I
even used to throw grease in the notch! I don;t know what I was thinking
back then, but hey, I was a kid I guess. But now that I grew up, I solved
the problem years ago by just slipping a length of fuel line over the
damned cable, long enough to shield it from the tranny, and all has been
well ever since. Why I didn't think to do this twenty-five years ago will
always remain one of the mysteries of my life.
