Subject: Re: [VB] Small nut gear set in a big nut RGB?

Wierd question, is your stub axle trashed and you have an early one around 
and hope it'll fit?   It won't.

The axle shaft is the same, any size of upper gear will fit it.

The lower gear is part of the stub axle.   the big nut stub fits the BNBox 
(64-67), and the small fits the 55-63 box.  Yes the big nut and little nuts 
stub axles are diff diameters, which means you have to have the drum to fit.  
 which is why the 1 ton '63 drums (later width, fit early size shaft) are 
hard to find.

However, the 63 1 ton stub axle fits the early box, and has the 1.26 gearing. 
  To do it the other way, to get 1.39 gearing with a later box you would have 
to find the rare 64-67 mountain gear stub axle.   These parts are listed in 
the parts list online, if you are interested in how many teeth each kind has 
the info is there.

Or you could swap it over for another tube &amp; box if you are wanting the 1.39 
Rgears

&lt;&lt; Can a small nut gear set be installed into a big nut RGB?  Is the actual
 output shaft a smaller ID or is it just the nut is smaller?
