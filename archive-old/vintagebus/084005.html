&gt;&gt;  I've tried a few times to determine where the voltage  drop was on my bus,
without getting any consistent results. I could  visually see that the 
battery cable was not in great shape-so I figured I  should replace it.  &lt;&lt;


Hi Kevin,
The battery cables are the second parts to check.  Check battery  voltage 
first at the posts.  Next while keeping contact with positive post  touch the 
body end of the ground cable.  You probably will have to scratch  the places 
where you are testing for non-corroded connections.  If there is  a voltage drop, 
the ground cable is bad and need replacing or requires  ends 
cleaned/tightened.  Next slide under your bus and connect to the main  power terminal on the 
solenoid and ground against the body.  Voltage drop  there indicates either 
bad/dirty/loose battery positive cable.
  If no noticeable voltage drop try keeping contact with the solenoid  
terminal and ground against the tranny.  If there is a voltage drop you  have a 
bad/dirty/loose body to tranny cable.
 Then once those connections are checked out you can move forward  through 
the electrical system grounding against the body where you can get to  bare 
metal.
