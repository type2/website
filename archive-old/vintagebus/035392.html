Subject: M code question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

M 544 anyone?

ps have no web access until the new mother board is installed, cannot look at 
websites.

is on the 59 westy I recently purchased from a W WA listmember

372 (us spec)
A23 (westy stuff)
168 (88 amp hour 6V battery- woooo-eee)
175 (overrider on bumpers)
181 (fancy chrome hubcaps)
544  -  ?

anyone have 535 (tach) ?

543- is no seating in rear for microbus/deluxe,  perhaps this is the verson 
for  a kombi, as they were going to put the westy kit in?

dunno much about these early westys- is the a usual M code witth them?

546- flashing indicators on roof at rear- nope, dont think that is it.
