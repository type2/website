So where are you in the process now?

It's not supposed to be that hard.

Get a bill of sale from the yahoo you're buying it from, with some
sort of statement that the title is lost.

Hike down to DMV, and tell them you're there to register the car,
but the title was lost.  Be polite.

What you have to do is re-construct the chain of ownership.

Now, if some other yahoos had the bus, but never registered it and
never filed any paperwork on it, they pretty much don't exist at
this point.

DMV will give you the name of the last few registered owners, we'll
call them A B and C .  Your task will be to get bills of sale from
A to B, B to C.   You'll also have to get one from C to D; D is
the guy you bought it from but DMV doesn't know him from Adam
'cause he never registered the damn thing.  You're E in this example,
and you should already have a Bill o' sale from D to E.

The nice lady at DMW with the beehive hairdoo will explain what
the correct, legal way to get these bills of sale is, and what to
do with them when you get them or what to do if you don't.   Basically
you need to send certified letters to all of them, asking them to
sign the bill of sale, (which you've already filled out for them, right?)
If they send your Bill of Sale, you're cool.  If they never send
anything, you use the receipt from the letter as proof you tried.  If
they send you a letter telling you to get stuffed you use the receipt
as proof you tried, and figure their letter got lost in the
mail (wink, wink)

Take this big pile of paperwork to DMV after the 30-day period (unless
you get the bills of sale back sooner) and you can then register
the car because you've re-constructed the title on it.
