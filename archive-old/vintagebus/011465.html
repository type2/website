Subject: Re: '65 Kombi (here I go again!)

I'm beginning to wonder if I' losing my mind because I bought another type
2. This time it is a '65 Kombi! It is in amazingly good shape and I got it
for a little more than a song!! Here is the catch, the tranny is shot. 

It has the original 1500 single port that according to the PO  was
completely rebuilt and now has &lt; 5k mi on it. The engine starts up on the
first crank and appears not to have been leaking oil. It has been sitting
for almost 2 years. The PO has been starting the engine on a near weekly
basis. It has has some kind of accessory oil cooler mounted behind the fan
shroud and a full flow oil filter which flows from that via hoses around to
sit near the left side of the carb then back. I've never seen this
configuration(?) but then that isn't saying much.

It has the bumpers and nose emblem. The rear bumper, however, was cut to
accomadate a bug muffler! Any thoughts on whether or not the bumper might
be fixable with a little welding know how?

There is no middle seat ( of course) but everything else is there on the
interior. All the panels are present (though some a little rough), except
the two in rear curved sections. Head liner is intact with only a minor
tear. The dash has a very small cut on the right side of the radio mount.
All the rubber mats are there and in decent shape.

The only visible rust is on  the left rear upper panel where there is some
old bondo work and on the surface of the cargo area floor (none of which
appears to be anywhere near thru and thru). All the floors/pans as far as I
could see are solid, including the in the front and the battery tray!!

There is smoe weirdness around the wheel wells in the rear (they were both
slightly reshaped and cut somewhat, not real obvious from a distance.

Supposedly all the brakes were reworked and bearings replaced prior to the
death of the tranny.

It has 3 very new tires, one is ruined from sitting flat for over a year.
I'm not sure about a spare. It also has a decent outdoor cover.

Anybody have any thoughts or suggestions. All the mechanics around say a
minimum of $1000 to replace/rebuild the tranny. I think I could R/R it, but
the reduction gear boxes scare me. Should I part it out? Any input will be
greatly appreciated on or off the list.
