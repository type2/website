Subject: Re: [VB] Windshield replacements

 The windshield seal is designed for a specific thickness of glass, me
thinks, best to ensure they cut you a piece of the right thickness...

Subject: [VB] Windshield replacements


Hello, list.

I am in need of a replacement driver's side windshield for my SC.
Here in my
area of Florida, they don't grow on trees and searching on the
internet has
been fruitless thus far.  So, instead of dealing with someone's fogged
and/or
pitted cast-offs plus the cost of shipping, I am considering having a
local
auto glass shop cut a new one using the passenger side as a pattern.
They say
they can do it for about $60.

Has anyone done this with any luck?  Or should I just hold out for the
real
deal?

TIA

Michael
