Subject:  Retractable seat/shoulder belt retrofit 

Someone asked recently about how to install retractable seat/shoulder belts in an early Type 2.

There's an article on this subject in either the March or April 2002 VW Trends magazine.  The article is about a Beetle retrofit, but the basic concept and principles would be much the same with a bus/transporter.

Apparently the retractor reels must be oriented in a specific manner in order to function correctly.  Something to do with the effects of gravity on the reel's innards.
