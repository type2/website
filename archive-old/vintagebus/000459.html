&lt;&lt; Source for 2 NOS headlight rings (Screws at 2 and 4 o-clock)&gt;&gt;
Hi Matthew,
Best to state that as if the headlight bucket mounting screw is considered 
the six o'clock position as it is on the bug.  After all the other headlight 
on the bus would be the same just opposite due to being mounted turned 180 
degree from the other.  03DEC63 from chassi number 1211643 would have used a 
2, and 7 O'clock adjusting screw patterned headlight buckets.  So yours 
should have had these instead.

&lt;&lt;fuel reserve cable and pull handle. (i already have the fuel diverter for 
the tank)&gt;&gt;
Wolfsburg West has these, and the knob is the same as a dash knob.

&lt;&lt;Source for getting a clock rebuilt (12V quartz rebuild OK) &gt;&gt;
We can clean, fix it cosmeticly, and ship it back for $35.00 in the USA.  
Takes up to three months for us to finish it though.  Eric&amp;Barb
