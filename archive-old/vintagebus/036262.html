Subject: cleaning a Westy tent ?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi all....

I have my driveaway Westy tent (68+ up style) up in my front yard to air out, 

there are a couple of spots where there is black mold / mildew. 
the material is fine, it just has these black blotches

what can I spray on it to kill the mildew and not harm the fabric?

I am not too worried about the spots, I just want to stop the mildew before I 
pack it up again

thanks for your advise
