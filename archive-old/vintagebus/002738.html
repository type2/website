Hi all renoir here,

Speaking of filtration, and not to start a war here,
could i have some opinions of installing a MaxiPump3 with a Mesa48 cooler,
and flow thru filter on my 1600 '71.
If i did this i could still keep the original cooler in place.

On very long grades, loaded down for camping, temperatures go very high.

For example, the long Yosemite grade, and Cajon pass north of San Bernadino
are a bear for temperature,
and i really do not push it.

Thanks all,
