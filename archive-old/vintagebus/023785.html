Subject: 2nd opinion *resolved* (for now)

Here's a lesson when the answer to the question is as old as the ages.
Stop &amp; listen to that little voice in your head...
it's softly urging you to remember past lessons and rely on your
'instinctual 1st judgement'.
Hear it?!?
its saying,
                **** $7 GRAND IS WAY OVER PRICED!!! ****

Doncha' just have to wonder how it is that these little VW busses
can alter ones perception of 'value'?

Anyway, I appreciate everyone's responses!! 
(and the offers to sell their own bus for $7K -if I *really* wanted to
spend the $$ :) 
I had a sinking feeling that this bus that I *really* liked (for all the
wrong reasons, like.. it's cute!) was offered to me (after waiting for
this one in particular for 3.5 yrs) at an exorbitant price. It was one
of those things.. I probably wouldn't consider buying another bus right
now if it hadn't been this one. 

But... I thought I'd see what others felt, just to make sure that I
hadn't missed some freak boom in the Camper-market while I toiled away
in Deluxe-land.

I talked again to the owner and 'discussed' things - negotiations
stalled at $4.7K, but as one kind splittie-member put it, &quot;Busses are
just a magnet that draws me in. But you can rarely get out for more than
it cost you to get in and 7k is a large entrance fee.&quot; How true.
&quot;Entrance fee&quot;- I like that! 
Even though I have a strong emotional pull to get this bus in
particular, it's not a $5K pull or even a $4k. I empathize with the
owner who wishes a return for the $$ invested, but the reminder that $
spent on 'upkeep'- inlcuding a replacement of a blown motor isn't the
sort of thing you can get reimbursed for- didn't help (go figure). I
suppose the advice of stepping back and evaluating the bus from the
non-owner persepctive..what would YOU pay for your own bus?..wasn't much
of a tactic, but I felt vindicated when there was a loooong moment of
silence before the topic was changed.

Anyway, the bus I assume will be up for sale at some point in the
future.
Perhaps it will be better priced, due to our discussion.. I hope so
because it'll make someone very happy- it's just got that good bus
feeling to it- plus it's completely stock. I can only hope that the
owner won't be successful &amp; will call me back w/ a better price- but I
won't hold my breath ;) 

Sure I'll ache for 'the one that got away'... but I'm doubly enjoying
the things I can now get for Bussie since I didn't spend the $$
elsewhere.

sage words from the newbie,

p.s.
The owner spoke of those 'magical' car-lots &quot;somewhere&quot; here in CA where
one could drive their old bus to and receive *thousands* (like more than
5) on the spot!! I really didn't have to pause too long to volunteer a
hypothetical path that the bus would be taking .. over-seas perhaps? 
Well, there are 'magical' places to take your old horse too, but I don't
consider Elmer's the ideal place. I bring this up because I have heard
this 'urban-legend'(?) a number of times... is there truly such a place?
