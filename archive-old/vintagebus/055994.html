Subject: Re: [VB] Clarafying the bus rims post...

&gt; I don't NEED the
&gt; extreme load range of the D rated Continental but I figure the stiffness
&gt; would be good down here in our severe winds. I do want something that is
&gt; over 1400lbs load range.

The PO of my 65 crew cab had General 205/75/R15 tires on the rear and
205/75/R14's on the front (to make the speedo read correctly I presume).
They have 2 steel belts and 1 polyester sidewall belt. The max load on these
tires is 1598 lbs. Does it sound like those would work for you?
