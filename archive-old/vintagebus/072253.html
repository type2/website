Subject: Re: [VB] Exchanged Keys Yesterday

Ya, find a mechanic who LIKES to work on splitties.  Isn't there some sort of 
registry for bus/ACVW friendly mechanics online?   On vintagebus_dot_com or 
somewhere? 

Or learn to do it yourself.  Sorting out the lights is actually not too 
tricky.  usually all it is is cleaning up the connections/grounds, checking for 
power with a test light,  and making sure everything is connected right as per 
wiring diagrams (on vintagebus_dot_com in colour)

&lt;&lt; Got sick of my mechanic putting my bus behind EVERY SINGLE repair job that
 came into his shop.  My money is just as good as everyone elses .. and I pay
 the second he says &quot;I need money for this or that .. &quot; Yet my bus is the last
 thing on his list of priorities.
 
 So I am looking for someone to finish what's left to be done in [electrical
 mostly] Central Florida.  Orlando area .. &gt;&gt;
