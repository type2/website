Subject: bus depot is horrible thier service is worse than thier people skills
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

well, 

    I encourage all of you to never order from bus depot ever. Please resist 
the low advertised prices on the web site. I placed a rather large order just 
to have them screw it up time after time .the first time that I ordered I 
spoke with julie at the order desk, she was eager to put through my order , 
but only at the listed catalog price only. which differed by three dollars 
from the web site price. They would not honor the web site price , I had to 
call and call till they finally said that they would honor the three dollar 
discount but only after they had failed to ship out my order in there 
so called ten day grace period . meanwhile my truck is resting on four jack 
stands waiting for them to get there act together. 16 days later when my 
order finally arrived,
may i add that they are in pennsylvania and dayton ohio is a small 8 hours 
away.
my order was for wheel bearing kits that had no seals. they had not included 
a invoice , instead it was a list from there wholesaler interamerican motors 
with all of there cost prices. I never even recieved a invoice from them 
telling me what I was charged.They had forgotten the left side brake hardware 
, which after I specially requested early kits and the salesman responded 
with ya ya ya  it will fit , &lt;sure it will&gt;of course they were wrong , how 
could people who call them selves the BUS DEPOT  be so ingnorant.  IF ANY ONE 
FROM BUS DEPOT READS THIS AND WISHES TO MAKE A FORMAL APPOLOGY PLEASE  
CONTACT ME
