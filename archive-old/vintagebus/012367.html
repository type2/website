Subject: preview of a 62 bus in texas
Date: Sat, 26 Dec 1998 19:56:33 PST
Mime-Version: 1.0

Would anyone be interested in looking at a bus for me and seeing if it 
is worth while for me to drive there?
It is located in texas near Fort Worth.
Also i would love to beg, borrow or buy a trailer to tow it home. If the 
deal goes thru.
Any idea's to make me happy!
signed Too many miles and too few dollars
