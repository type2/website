Subject: Re: [VB] fixing a door with bad lower hinge

&lt;&lt; &gt; I have an original paint 64 bus ,

&gt; but the drivers door is messed up.

&gt; the lower hinge was stuck , and the previous owner forced it open ,

&gt; so now the hinge is torn away from the door, OUCH !

&gt; I  can loosen up the hinge so that it will work ,

&gt; but how do I attach it back to the door ?

&gt;

I had the same problem on my 67 rivi when I got it. 
The door was completely separated from the hinge.

I removed the door and hinge, aligned the hinge to the door carefully.  
Welded it on, rattled canned the welded area white, and re-hung it.   

To remove the big phillip headed bolts, get an impact driver and a big 
hammer.  

Door works great now.   If you look for it, you can see the white I used was 
a different shade than the original Pearl White.  I am glad I didn't hang 
another door, as other than that, the orignal door is fine, plus it matches.  

Yes, oil your hinges and lube the stay-open prop.
