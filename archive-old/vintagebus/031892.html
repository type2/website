&lt;&lt; Do you have an address for the fair grounds or the names of two roads 
intersecting near by? I'm trying to get directions off the net and they dont 
have a listing for the fairgrounds. &gt;&gt;
Hi Ronnie,
Best to go by directions.  Take I-5 until you get into the Southern outskirts 
of Tacoma.  Take the 127 exit to Puyallup via highway 512.  That leads you 
fairly straight out East to Puyallup.  Just before you get to Puyallup the 
highway takes a hard left curve and plunges down a very steep slope.  At the 
very bottom of this slope is the exit you need to take to the fair grounds!  
The exit is both short and steep so you have to keep your speed in check down 
the big hill and be ready to really slow yourself down at the beginning of 
the exit!  At the end of the exit is a traffic light, for those who are 
walking into the meet you turn left pass on under the highway and the fair 
grounds are on your left with parking on the right.  Those who are swapping 
or showing spaces turn right and take the next two right turns to end up 
behind the fairgrounds for set up either Sat 7-9PM or Sun 6-9AM.  The Wet 
Westies (wetwesties_at_onelist_dot_com) club will be camping out behind the 
fairgrounds Sat night.
