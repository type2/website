&lt;&lt; Now if you have a mechanical fuel pump, you are still looking for the same 
symptoms. &gt;&gt;
Hi Kyle,
We even had a stock fuel pump break one of it's return springs inside to 
about 2/3 of original length.  Result was a bug that would drive at idle and 
low RPMs just fine, but would not function at high RPMs.  Also have heard of 
one case where the owner liked to add fuel additives.  One bottle of fuel 
additive he liked had a styrofoam antitamper seal just under lid.  Suddenly 
his Vw would not run right for more than a few minutes at a time.  Turned out 
there was no fuel filter sock was installed on the outlet tube of the gas 
tank in a VW, and one of the seals on the fuel additive bottles that he had 
torn open, but not completely off had fallen loose into the tank when he 
poured it in.  Resulting in the seal getting sucked onto the tip of the 
outlet tube and sticking there due to the vaccum till several minutes later 
when the vaccum dissipated and the seal floated free.  Then the engine would 
run fine until the seal was sucked down again!   Eric&amp;Barb
