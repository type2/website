Subject: timing setting on a 1600 dp w/ 009?????

Doees anyone know the exact correct setting for the timing?? I think
now mine is set at 6 BTDC, but is that what it should be?? I'm running
this 1600 dp in my 67 13 window deluxe **(camper roof)**.......

I would really like to know for my own sake b/c my VW friend told me
that 6-7 BTDC with a Bosch 009 was right, but I have not seen it
documented anywhere!!!

Thank ya!
J
