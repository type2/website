Subject: Re: [VB] 65 flasher relay
References: &lt;10.1b60780.26130027_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have one of these big flasher boxes that I think was pulled out of a 65.  the
part number is 111 953 225.  It has 9 terminals and is in rather good shape.  It
works to the best of my knowledge.
If anyone wants to give me 130 bucks for it they're more than welcome to! hehe
anyone need this? It even has a little diagram on it that would coincide with a
wiring diagram.

I also have the following pieces:
a round Bosch electrical bit.  2 prong with terminals &quot;S&quot; and &quot;+&quot;  The casing is
just scratched so I can't read all of the part #

211.953.191  -  4 terminal rectangular deal made by SWF

311 941 581A  -  6 terminal rectangular deal made by Bosch

all are 6V
anyone need these?  All are good to the best of my knowledge.

Isaiah


&gt;   Only in 1966-67 did
&gt; the all in one big boxes with nine wores going into them as far as we know
&gt; end up way over $130.00.
