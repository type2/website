All you West Coast folks are kinda spoiled like that, but here in Raleigh, NC,
we've got what I consider to be an amazing bus, and expecially truck,
population. I drive daily my '62 crew cab, there are 2 different driver '63
single cabs, as well as 2 different '71 crew cabs. In the past there was also a
'59 single cab, and '63 crew cab. Then there are at least 4 or 5 splitty
Westies &amp; standards, as well as tons of late models. Raleigh is actually a
pretty hip VW place...

&gt;  &gt; Maybe half dozen, no a
&gt;  &gt; dozen splits around, large number of bays.  Seems all the split drivers
&gt; know
&gt;  &gt; each other, but then again this is a small town and if you don't want
&gt; someone
&gt;  &gt; to know what you are doing, don't do it, or don't care if they know.
&gt;
&gt;  what small town do you live in that has a DOZEN splitties driving around?
&gt; i'm the    only one in nashville that i've seen that actually drives. i know
&gt; a guy who has about six, but it's mainly just me and him, as far as i know.
&gt; i'm not doubting you, i was just curious.

&gt; ...Oly WA,   which was evidently recently called the hippest town in the west
&gt; by Time magazine or some such rag.   No clue why they did.   But yes there
&gt; are about half a dozen driving around I regularly see and half a dozen more I
&gt; know drive but I dont see much (differnt schedules/ routes or their use as a
&gt; second car) as wells as more I know of that are yard art, barn art  or &quot;about
&gt; to be fixed&quot;
