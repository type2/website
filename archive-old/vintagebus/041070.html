Well you are right clothing is optional. Though I would not recommend
letting it all hang out during the day. The sun down there can get you in
trouble. I have been in the valley several times on rock hounding
expeditions and I always seem to make it over to the springs for some
socializing. I have met some remarkable people there. I would say that a
good amount of people tend to were clothes while visiting. except maybe when
soaking in the springs.
Basically it is a place that you can do everything that you could do at
burningman and not have to be in competition with some yuppie types from the
bay area.

Count me in !  we go to Death Valley about every year
in our 67 camper but have never been to the hot
springs (big naked Hot Springs place according to my
neighbor who keeps inviting us to go with her to a big
camp out at the springs)
Count me in... bout a 7 hour trip from Reno

Going back to a previous thread...why it seems kinda
like a 'Hippy Place'.....
