 &lt;Also, you will find the heat log and the bed have issues 
 over using the same space- take the door off under the z bed and cut a hole 
 in the wood in the bottom of it.&gt;
 
 If you do like Westfalia did, and put it in a kombi, you won't have a

then what was I supposed to do with my deluxe,  use it as a 9 seater?  How do 
I camp in it?  When this bus is dialed in, I'm selling the westy.  The
