Subject: sticky oil piston

hey all - recent colder weather has emphatically demonstrated a possible
problem w/ my oil pressure: too much.
i am running a 71 universal case, doghouse, 20-50 highrev valvoline, 2
relief pistons and a schadek late pump; in the past, the oil pressure at
startup would go to around 95 or so, and come down to 60 at high rpm after
3 or 4 mins (15-30 at idle). SOMETIMES the guage would wiggle from 90 to 70
at high rpms before dropping, so i suspected i had a sticking piston, but
with temps below 50 this week, i get pressures of 150 (!) at startup, and i
can't rev above 2200 for some time or it goes HIGHER. it also will take a
good 10 minutes to finally drop down to 'normal.'  i have NO desire to pop
the cooler - if that pressure is seeing the cooler that is. my questions
are: which piston is likely to be sticking, pressure or relief?
i have looked at several manuals, and it looks like the  pressure
switch/sender 'sees' pressure before the cooler, so perhaps everything is
fine and dandy, but it seems to me that the pressure relief valve working
properly would bypass the restrictive cooler circuit, and pressure should
drop as most of the oil flows straight to the bearings.
the pressure relief valve would seem to be less of a culprit - and less of
a problem. if sticking closed, it would just send excess oil into the
cylinders; if stuck OPEN, it would normally be dumping my rod pressure
right to zero, but at 150 psi i worry a little less about this :P

i'll  look at both, but just wanted any one's input who has seen this
before for things to watch for.
