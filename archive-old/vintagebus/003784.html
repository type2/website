Common problem with electric fuel pumps. They can't keep up at highway
speeds for whatever reason, may it be plugged screen in the tank, plugged
screen in the pump, plugged fuel filter, insufficient size for the
application, or a blockage in the needle valve for the float. In any case
the effect is that at speed the engine uses all of the fuel it has in the
float bowl and then craps. Idle for a couple of minutes and it's off to the
races again for a minute. Now if you have a mechanical fuel pump, you are
still looking for the same symptoms. Anything that would restrict the flow
of fuel, and/or an incorrect push rod, loose mounting or anything else that
might not let the pump make the most of the stroke it gets with each turn of
the dizzy drive. Failed check valves in the pump, leaky diagphragm, etc.
Time to get the beer can fuel measuring device out like in the idiot book.
