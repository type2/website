Subject: Re: [VB] bleh! gas

Hi Volks,
We just install about six or eight extra inches of fuel line just in front of 
the engine.  Then one can just back out the engine and drop it several 
inches.  Then reach over the forward engine tin and remove the fuel line and 
plug it with a golf tee.  In our VWs we have been installing reserve valves 
which can be switched by hand off before removing the engine and comes in 
real handy when one wants to replace all the fuel line forward of the engine 
without having to drain the fuel tank first!   Eric&amp;Barb
