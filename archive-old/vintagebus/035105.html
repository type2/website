I took off the belt as some folks suggested and the noise didnt stop. I did 
find that the center section of my pully was about gone and replaced it.
    Also, in search of the root of this sound and because I prefer to adjust 
my valves and change axle boots sitting upright rather than on my back, I 
will be pulling the engine soon. Anything I should do while its out? I plan 
on replacing the fuel line                                                    
          and tighting everything down, what else should I look for/replace?
