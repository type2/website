Subject: Re: [VB] Changing from swing axles to newer CV joint axles

Hi Dave,
Glad we could help!
We found that investing in better tires (with at least 1525 Lbs. weight  
rating), shocks, and installing 1966-67 suspension with the front anti-sway bar  
helped vastly how our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion and 1963 SC 
handled  on the highway.  Especially in side winds or even when semi trucks passed  
us.  No more sudden involuntarily lane changes!!!

Thanks for the info.  I'm starting to think that the  conversion would be too
much trouble.  I thought handling would be  better but if the work out ways 
the benefit then why do it.

Thanks  again

Dave
