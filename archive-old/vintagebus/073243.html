Subject: RE: [VB] Front Trans Mount Q

I totally agree. I have replaced the mount with engine in but it's a royal pain. Pull the motor and replace the front mount first and then tighten the rest after. You will notice that the mount(s) on the cradle are ovaled, to provide adjustments so that you can center the transaxle properly.
