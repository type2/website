Subject: Re: [VB] 6V starter

how is the voltage on your battery?   Funny thing is, I am having a similar 
issue with my new motor, I was cranking it round with the starter, it was slow, 
the battery was low and old.   Took the bell housing/starter off the engine, 
start spun fine not attached to motor, but it takes more oomph to turn a 
motor.   Did you put fresh oil in? thinner oil that usuall?

&lt;&lt; es I'm sure, as this car is a very original (62K) one owner car (T3). 
 I don't think the motor had ever been removed before.  Almost every
 part/hose/wire is original.  It sat for 25 years.  When I can get the
 starter to engage (even though it is briefly, there are no grinding noises)
 
 Thanks again!!
