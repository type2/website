i got a bunch of old vw parts a month or so ago and among these was one of 
the steps that fit in the jack ports.  im not sure if its aftermarket or not. 
 i know that it was made before 1982 because thats the last these parts were 
touched or added to until recently.  if anyone is interested in this let me 
know because i dont want it and im sure someone here might.  thanks.
josh
