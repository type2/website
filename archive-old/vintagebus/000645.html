&lt;&lt; Polish by hand using polishing cream (mothers Mag / Aluminum polish, or the
 like).  A few days and sore forearms and blisters later you end up with a

Hi George,
Are you using the three differant grits of Mother's polish?  Just found out 
from a Kirby vaccume cleaner repairman that this is at or can be ordered from 
&quot;Cut Rate Auto Parts&quot; stores out this way.  This after years of using lots of 
sand paper before going to just the fine grit Mother's polish.   Eric&amp;Barb
