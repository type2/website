&gt; What everyone seems to be forgetting is that he stated that if he
&gt; plumbed a short line from his oil pump cover back into the case
&gt; his oil pressure was fine.  So he has already isolated the problem
&gt; to be related to either the oil lines or his oil filter.  The problem is
&gt; most likely that his oil filter is too restrictive.

To be perfectly honest, I went back to stock to get the pressure.
This is what I did- Remove the oli lines and filter. Swap the plugged
Brazilian pump for a German pump that measured .001 larger o.d.
on the case bore. Swap the full-flow cover for a stock cover.
Miked the case bore and torqued case bolts around the pump
much tighter to gain .001 squeeze at the inlet/outlet. The case
measured .0011 loose top to bottom and .0003 loose side to side.
Removed the paper cover gasket to get less clearance at the gears.
Called the Oberg oil filter supplier. There is very little restriction in
this
5 micron screen. It flows 200 gpm and has a bypass indicator at 6 psi
pressure differential. It has about 3 ounces of volume, where your Fram
filter holds a pint or more. The hoses are steel-core hydraulic rated at
3000 psi. I'm pretty sure the pump and cover will provide the answer.
This is a new engine. Bearing tolerances are well documented.
But it is also line-bored, and there is a question as to how that has any
effect on oil pressures. Berg doesn't like line-bore.
There are cryptic specs for those relief / control valve springs.
The factory spec for oil pressure, Without Guesswork, 41.5bhp ( SAE )
engine states ( only for SAE 30 oil ) temperature of 158F _at_ 2500 rpm.
42 psi new, and 28 psi wear limit. Why do we get more than that ?
