Subject: Middle seat FS in Nor Cal.

I bought this middle seat awhile back, used it for a while, and found that
for what  I use my bus for, I don't need seating for 8 (and its also not
correct for my walkthrough). For the last few months it's just been sitting
in my garage collecting dust, taking up _alot_ of space.  So if your
interested and you can pick it up, go to
http://www.jps_dot_net/pperez/middle.htm .  Might be interested in trades of
some sort although I'm not sure what for.  I'm kind of a &quot;in-the-closet&quot;
custom guy so I'm always looking for rims, hi-perf stuff, lowered spindles
and such to collect for future projects. Of course money isn't bad either;o)
