All right...I ended up putting in the 75 air correction jet and the 127.5
main.  Seems better, but the stutter is still there when I try to lug it.

I haven't closed the butterfly hole yet.

I'll try the bigger air correction jet, and maybe drilling out one of my
extra .120 mains.

Note:  Before, when I had the big problem going up hills at all, the plugs
wer BLACK and fuzzy.

I'm going to a VW shop tomorrow to get some brake parts, and I'll ask him
for jets, too...
