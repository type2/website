Subject: More Oil Filtering
Message-ID: &lt;17cda81f.24860db8_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

To All:

One of my spies sent me a copy of Dave's message to Andy (see Dave's message 
below) with the comment:

'Did you write a sermon on by-pass oil filters?  I must have missed it.'
 

Me too.  To the best of my knowledge, the only time(s) I've ever mentioned 
by-pass oil filters was to explain why they don't work, why they shouldn't be 
used or to cite VW's service bulletins saying the same thing.

I HAVE written quite a bit about full-flow oil filter systems AND about 
remotely mounted oil coolers.  But Dave is referring specifically to a 
by-pass filtering set-up, which I've never advocated nor written about other 
than in the negative, as above.

I suspect Dave has mistaken some other article for one of mine.  Or I've 
failed to make a clear distinction between an externally mounted oil cooler 
and a full-flow filtering system.  

You can use a divertor to move the oil cooler outside of the blower 
housing... as Volkswagen did starting with the '71 model [ie, the so-called 
'dog-house' oil cooler].  And I HAVE written about that.  But you can't put a 
filter in that line.  (That's what the VW service bulletins were about, 
following the introduction of by-pass oil filter kits in the mid-1950's. ) 

Full-flow oil filtration systems take the oil directly from the oil pump and 
filter it.  All of it (...with rare exceptions).  By-pass systems take some 
of the oil some of the time and may or may NOT filter it, depending on the 
design of the system.  In the worse case, a by-pass filter could SHUT OFF the 
oil to critical parts of the engine, which was the reason behind the VW 
service bulletin.

They still sell by-pass systems of course.  And certain people still use 
them.  Of course.  NOS phreaks have orgasms over the things (VW dealers sold 
a FRAM by-pass filter kit... for a while).  To someone suffering from NOS 
Syndrome the FRAM/VW by-pass filter kit is the kewlest of the kewl... even if 
it destroys your engine.  

Too bad they don't spend more time collecting old VW service bulletins :-)

  A filter of any sort is a really good idea.  You probably read Bob Hoover's
  reply already.  I can't add to what he already said, but there's a few 
options
  to consider as to what kind of filter and where to put it.  By far, the 
best is
  a full flow filter.  This filters all your oil.  The next best is a remote
  cooler/filter setup.  I came across Bob's recommended oil cooler/filter 
setup in
  the Sermons while they were still available online.  Basically a diverter 
plate
  from where the stock oil cooler lives, lines through the fan shroud to the 
left
  side of the engine room through a filter to a cooler assembly.  It doesn't
  filter all your oil all the time, just when the oil's reached operating
  temperature and has been diverted through the cooler.  The cooler system is
  quite efficient, and the filter is mounted on the left side engine room 
pillar.
  I haven't bothered calculating thermal efficiencies or anything fancy like 
that
  but I have noticed a 50 degree drop in my oil temps.  The filter is easily
  accessible, and the system adds almost a quart to the amount of oil a 
complete
  oil/filter change takes (additional oil capacity).
