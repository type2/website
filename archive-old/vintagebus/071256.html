Subject: Re: [VB] Reely Stoopid Oil Question

 &gt; How does one pour oil into the stock oil tower without either going really
 slow, or spilling it all over the frickin' place?

Most auto parts stores sell screw on oil fill spouts. They are about 3&quot; long and have a on-off valve. You can
adjust the rate of flow. It extends past the vent drain hose. Usually under a buck everywhere. When Kmart had
their closing-the-store-by-me-sale, I got a half dozen of them for a quarter each.
