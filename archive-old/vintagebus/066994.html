Subject: Re: [VB] Spraying POR-15

[...]

Thom,

If you clean out the gun every 20 minutes or so, with POR solvent, as
you're working, you can keep the spray gun in good condition, and thus buy
a decent quality unit. POR gets everywhere, and you must wear an aspirator
with solvent filters, plus I suggest goggles and a hat for your hair.

Good luck!

&gt; Since it is a large area I would like to spray on the two coats.  I am
&gt; looking for suggestions on what type of spray gun to use for this?  This
&gt; time I will also be using the Tie-Coat as a primer and have some solvent to
&gt; clean up with.
