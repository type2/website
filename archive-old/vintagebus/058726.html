Subject: For Sale


First let me apologize for posting like this but this guy doesn't have 
access to a computer or the net so...

A fellow here in town is unloading his VWs as follows:

1963 11-window bus: described as funky surface rust with some rocker ick.  
Apparently runs with a very low mileage (gene berg?) engine that will need 
seals replaced since it has been sitting a very(!) long time.  Says it 
runs...

1963? Notchback with lots of hard parts including straight pan.

1961 Bug described as very nice with an engine ready to go in... and he will 
be putting it in.

1963 Rag bug in need of restoration... this is described as a ground up 
troops... AND I am trying to pick this one up so first dibs on this one.  
But just in case I can't swing it and you might be interested keep it in 
mind... otw.

Call him in Benicia, CA (not me) at (707) 748-1319.  Ask for Chad.

62 15-Window
64 Sunroof bug
