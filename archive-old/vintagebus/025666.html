Joe didn't mention two other new things WW is going to be selling.

1.  Early Westy louvered window seal kits.  All the seals you need to
restore the 4 pane louvered windows on splitty Westies.

2.  Bumper splash pan rubber molding.  I don't think anyone else is making
these.


I have not personally seen these parts, so I don't make any claims as to
their soundness.  Just re-posting the WW e-newsletter.

S.
