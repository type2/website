&gt;   Howdy all. Since the last run of Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team shirts sold
&gt; so quickly, I am doing another run. I will also be reprinting the Truckin'
&gt; shirts, with the single cab and double cab graphic, a frontal shot of a
&gt; split-window bus, and also a logo shirt for my new website- TeamSpatula_dot_com
&gt; Pictures of the designs are viewable at:

Hi All;
   Unsolicited comment. If you've ever seen the quality of Poor Richard's shirts
you will know what I'm saying when I say &quot;Awesome!&quot; Great graphics, terriffic
artwork, great quality material. Order them and you will not be dissapointed. Bus
