&gt;In the dead of winter, the sheetmetal between my calves and the front beam
&gt;gets very cold, and can actually feel the cold radiate from the metal to
&gt;my leg if it is within 6 inches of it.

Get a longish blanket and put it in the seat so the end of it hangs over
the front edge and down to nearly the floor.  This will probably work
better if you have seat belts, because the blanket will probably make it
easy for you to slide around on the seat.

Or, make up some kind of rigid insulation panel, and put some magnets on
it.  Stick it to the seat pedestal in the fall, and take it out in the
spring.  You could even paint the panel to match.
