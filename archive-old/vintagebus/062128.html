Subject: Re: [T2] Fixing Oil Leak

Had the same mysterious leak on a 1600 type one that i put back into 
service after a long storage spell.  When i pulled that engine back off 
the seal was a definite leaker.  Wasnt the seam at all.
Evidently had dried out during its long storage time in a hot shed.

&gt; I have a 1600DP which I had out, stripped down and retorqued, and 
&gt; thoroughly
&gt; cleaned of its oil and gunk coating.
&gt; There was no trace of leakage at the pushrod tubes, the valve covers, 
&gt; the
&gt; doghouse oil cooler or the flywheel seal. It just seems to seep out of 
&gt; the
&gt; seam on the bottom surface between the case halves, near the front 
&gt; (FIF) of
&gt; the engine and just behind the sump filter plate.
