Subject: don't forget that wire!

Shift bushing bolt wire, that is!
I had spent many hours &quot;Weddling&quot; my tranny not so long ago, and recently I
got around to replacing the plastic bushings under the cab floor that the
shifter rides in. Regreased everything, tightened it all down etcetc. Took
it for a test drive, and it was GREAT. For a block or so. THEN it developed
a nasty habit of NOT going in to first, but prefering third - made people
behind me at lights VERY angry :P
Well, it stumped me for a week, led me to not drive the bus unless an
emergency, in general snarl at people...
finally crawled back under the bus and started over. While I had tightened
down the odd square-head bolt that holds the rodbushing to
the rear shift lever, it had worked itself     j  u  s  t      loose enough
to allow the bushing to turn with OUT turning the tranny rod behind it.
This prevented the levers inside the tranny nose from properly aligning,
leading to that 'brick wall' feeling. I had a few people tell me to 'just
make sure its tight' and forego the baling wire. DON'T. I took some wire,
looped it around the bushing, threading the wire thru the lil bolt and then
twisting it together (the book tells you to make sure you twist it in the
&gt;proper&lt;  direction, so that it adds tension to the bolt, instead of
loosening it some). There is a small positioning divot in the shift rod
coming out of the tranny; make sure the bolt is in there :)

I now have a snappy little shifter lever up front! TIGHT, crisp and firm
pattern, with no stubborn gears or accidental Reverse instead of Second
wonkiness. It literally is like driving a different bus - previously, I
could swat the shifter around in a good foot-wide circle before finding a
gear some days!

Moral of the story? A) No excuse for sloppy shifting... cost me less than
$100   and B) no matter what the procedure you run, if it didn't work START
AGAIN and check everything twice. Its usually sumpin stoopit.
......................like my bus not running at all last week, and Lewis
came over and said &quot;did ya check the timing?&quot; Well, of course I had.

I'd set it at zero, however :P
