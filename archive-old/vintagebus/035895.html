&lt;&lt;So this is the same case as with the 4 tip monza style exhaust?&gt;&gt;

The 1950-57 bus simply used the 25-36 single tip type 1 muffler with the long 
exhaust tip cut off so a dogleg shaped tip could get down around the rear 
bumper.  This worked fairly well for the barndoor with no rear upper hatch.  
But apparently shortly after the rear upper hatch was standard they realised 
that this style of muffler was causing carbon monoxide poisoning.  So in 1958 
with the introduction of the Bastard 40 HP engine the bus only single tip out 
to the rear corner muffler was issued, and proceeded to be used on to 1971.  
Plus the type 4 bus muffler and vanagon had mufflers that the single tip went 
out to the rear corner.  Why out to a rear corner?  To place the exaust into 
the slipstream of air going past the side of the bus.  To use a one, two, or 
four tipped type 1 muffler on the flat boxey ended bus causes a cloud of 
carbon monoxide to cling to the back of the bus.  This can be seen very well 
if you ever have a small oil leak from the engine.  You end up with the rear 
of your bus covered with tiny spots of oil all the way up to the top of the 
rear hatch window due to this dead air space behind your bus!  Since the 
interior of any automobile is at lower pressure than the air just outside of 
it at higher speeds than about 20 MPH this sucks in air into the interior 
through any crack, hole, or other opening.  Meaning that you end up at best 
slowly damaging the brains of you, and your passengers over time.  This can 
even change a persons personality, and mentally derange by way of chemical 
frontal lobotamy over time with exposure to this gas.  Or finding your 
passengers dead in the rear of the bus when you thought they were just 
asleep.  Even if one has no rear hatch carbon monoxide will be sucked into 
the engine compartment through any hole including a bad engine to body seal, 
or the engine hatch seal being bad.  This will be pumped into the heating 
system to produce the same results.  The engine lid seals being sold that we 
know of are junk.  Does anyone out there know where to get original style 
ones? 
  So unless your 1950-57 is a show bus compleatly restored, and only driven 
on sunny days with the front windows open.  This is another reason if you 
drive your 1950-57 bus daily to consider updating to later mechanicals, and 
keep the exhaust tips where they belong on later buses.
