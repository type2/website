Well, after getting a lot of postive feedback about the mailbox she made me
for X-mas, my wife decided to start making them to sell.

She recently made 10 of them for me to barter for a VW based trike. The guy
with the trike suggested the deal! So she took advantage of the situation
to make a few different styles. If you send her a picture of your bus,
she'll make you a mailbox that matches it.  You can get pictures &amp;
