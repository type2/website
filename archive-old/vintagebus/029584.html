And the number one reason that your motor is running so hot...

Vane type superchargers heat the mixture.  Radically!  When I had a
Judson supercharger on my TR-4 I had to run water injection to 1.)
cool the intake charge and 2.) prevent detonation.  With a rear
engined air cooled motor you'll never hear it.  Go get a Spearco water
injector (Injectronic®) and solve the problem. (Unless you've already
built the motor for supercharging...  I'd guess, without running the
numbers that you'd want about a 4.5-5:1 initial compression ratio.
Maybe less...)  

Supercharging a motor isn't quite as simple as 'bolt-on'.If you'd
like, I can scan and send you an article (very general) on
supercharging written by L.J.K Setright, one giants of automotive
journalism. There is also an H.P. Books book on Supercharging that
should help you successfully set up and run the Judson unit.

Based on my experience, after you get the unit properly setup and
dialed in you'll next be replacing your trans... BTDT, got the recipts!
