Go to myon line catalog, search around and you will see all the mirrors
available.
I sell the same ones as WW, they are made in taiwain and are of good to
excellent quality, I sell them for 18.00 a pop, clamps 3.50 and the arm for
12.00. There actually is another available from Izzy, but these are
expensive for the daily driver, non trailer queen, we use are bus type of
person.
