Hey Volks

Well, the Zebra Safari preparations are nearly complete and
we leave Johannesbrg tomorrow, a few days after our proposed
departure date.

I had a major setback last week -- my notebook computer was
stolen in a burglary at my home. I do have back-ups of most
of my work, but I lost all my contacts for the Zebra Safari.
So if anyone has previously corresponded with me or if
anyone on the list has forwarded my address to others who
corresponded with me, please email again so I can keep up
the communication. I have lost ALL email contacts, so unless
volks re-establish links they won't be hearing from me
again.

I got a new laptop yesterday, so I'm back in communication
with the world. Please email me.

We have a working version of our website posted on a temp
server, so I won't give out the url just yet, but I will
post it in a day or two once the site is up on its permanent
home.

With just 24 hours to go before departure I still have to
move my personal effects and furniture into storage and we
also have to instal in the bus the semi-camper kit we have
fabricated out of plywood. Looks like we might be working
through the night. And we've delayed the start by more than
two weeks now, so another day won't make a difference. It's
time to start working to African time ...

OK, that's just a quickie to let you all know what's up and
that the Zebra Safari is on track give or take a hiccup or
two.
