&lt;&lt; Where do the seatbelts bolt into my DC?  I've looked behind the front seat
 and back seat and cannot find where they attach to.  Thanks,

dunno that 63s got seat belt mounts installed (was an option for some times- 
standard in 66 or 65?)

so they mount where you mount them- use a big fat washer underneath to spread 
the load.  I used 1&quot; sections of torsion leaves as washers when installing 
seat belts in my 61- and that stuff is hard to cut and drill, but flexy.
