Subject: So basically ..

So basically what everyone is saying is that my bus is doomed.  I have spent
all my money on this beast and trade away my 71.  Maybe if I buy some
insurance and the bus has an accident I can recover my loss.  But seriously -
if it is as bad as I think it must be, there is NO WAY I would sell it to
someone else.  Just suck it up and take the loss.

Diane
