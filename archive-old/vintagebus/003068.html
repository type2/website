After what seemed like forever I finally got my 67 westy home. While
dispersing with 16 years worth of nastyness I noticed that the VIN plate had
been removed. I bought this knowing that i would have to do a title search
so now i have to locate the #s on the body. My question is where are the #s
stamped at?
thanks----------Bryan
