Happy Eostre, Volks!

I have two problems so far ('66 Westy) that I haven't been able to figger
out.  The re-assembly is almost complete!

*My turn signals ALL work, but only my front hazards function.  How is that
possible? Aren't they on the same line?

*My gas gauge was pegging when I turned on the lights, but would go dead
when I turned the ignition on.  I messed with the fuses, and now it does
nothing.  FWIW, there is a baywindow tank and sender back there, and I only
have 5 gallons.

So far, all my problems have been grounding related.  One by one, they go
away as I clean off the paint and apply a thin coat of anti-seize.
