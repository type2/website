This is correct, even new shocks will compress and stay that way. Except for
coil overs. The resitance to squishing and leakage are the what to watch
for.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The shocks were pretty easy.  I put on KYB GR-2s.  The old shocks were
totally worn out - I could compress them by hand and they would stay
compressed.


But arent all stock vw shocks like this. They just resist change they dont
have any springing action.
