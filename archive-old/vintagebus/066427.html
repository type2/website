Subject: RE: [VB] delayed test drive

  Torquing the drums puts pressure on the spacer, thus the o-ring, sealing
the axle/spacer to bearing area, where your gear oil is leaking more then
likely

ronnie

ps. a word of wisdom. Not lubing either the seal or sealing race will cause
the seal to burn prematurely causing it to leak

&gt;&gt;torque the 46/36s at least some, the trans may drip at the axle ends.&lt;&lt;

Al, I did not have the drums on yet. How does not torgueing the drums cause
the leak?  If I torque the drums and then took them off later for what ever
reason, would it not leak because the seal is now properly seated?  Did I
just answer my own question?!
