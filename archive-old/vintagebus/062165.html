Subject: RE: Restoring front beam and greasing it!

&gt; &gt;What is involved in restoring the beam, should I just sandblast it and 
&gt; &gt;get it painted or powdercoated?  Are there any bushes that I should
&gt; &gt;replace whilst it is off?
&gt;
&gt; Eric&amp;Barb gave good advice.  I would add that the Bentley manual has
&gt; good procedures for completely tearing down and rebuilding the front
&gt; beam.  Since Monday, there are Bentley manuals for every Bus we talk
&gt; about on this list (1950-1967) so there really isn't any good reason
&gt; not to have one.

I definitely agree with that - they are not too easy to get in the UK, with
most places having them on back order.  I ordered one from Bentley in the
US- and to my astonishment it arrived about 36 hours later!  And it cost the
same as it would of done in the UK.

Thanks a lot for your help
Paul
