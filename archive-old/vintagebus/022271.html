I just recently bought a 1960 westy, it was exported to France.
My questions are:

1. Since it was in France would the bumpers be the ones with the overriders
or the European blade type?

2. What exactly does the D23 stand for? I am pretty sure it means that the
interior package is a SO 23, but what does the D stand for? Deluxe?

3. What color is SK 654C?

Thank you for your help!
