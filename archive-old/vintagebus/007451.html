The Great Race 2001 had a 10:10AM pit stop scheduled in Santa Clarita
Saturday, and the Race ended at 1:00PM PDT in Pasadena.

The Great Race folks publish all the stopping places, but the routes between
stops are kept secret.

Here's the website for the Race, plus a link to Speedvision's site.
Speedvision has also been following the Race and their reports have a
different perspective than the &quot;official&quot; blurbs.

&gt;&gt;  The Great Race (the History Channel one, not the other one) passed
through
Santa Clarita (next valley north of LA) today.  I didn't know it was going
through, but on the way back from breakfast I glimpsed the Hebmueller with
&quot;Great Race&quot; insignia on it going the other way down Soledad Canyon road.
