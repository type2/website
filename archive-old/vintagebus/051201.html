Subject: Re: [VB] whistling windows! what? i can't hear you!

I have this problem too, on my passenger side. It's not too loud, but
obnoxious. I think mine is on the vent glass because I don't have that
little pop rivet in there.

&gt; as i think about road trip plans i cannot help but think of one thing-not
&gt; getting the motor ready-not planing the camping or the route-but the damn
&gt; whistling windows-i love my bus, but sometimes it is too much for me.
anyone
&gt; have any home remedies for the problem of the whistling windows-my only
&gt; trick is to open one wondow a little bit to to make it quieter.
