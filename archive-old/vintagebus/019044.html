&gt; If none of this gets it, let us know, because then
&gt; it really gets
&gt; interesting.  :)

Matt,

I guess it is time to get interesting.  I checked out
all the tip's you gave me on both the
flasher/emergency relay's and witing under the dash. 
Everything check out OK.  I did find that my flasher
relay was not working properly so i replaced that.  In
doing that, everything works with the key on or off.  

The new item is the turn signal light on the dash. 
When the key is OFF and the turn sig (TS) and
Emergency relay (ER) are off the dash turn signal
light is on.  Brightly on.  when i switch the TS or ER
on the dash light blinks like it should with the key
on or off.  When i turn those off the dash light
stay's on.  If i turn the key to ON and leave the TS
and ER off then the dash turn dignal light goes OFF.

I metered the wire from the flasher to the dash TS
light.  It is providing a constant +12V when
everythign is off.  I also checked the #15 wire from
the ignition to the dash pod. It is at +.3V when the
key is off and +12V when it is on.  With the key off,
and the TS light on the dash on i can pull the bulb
and the light goes off.

Does this sound correct?  Any other places i can look.
 It seams to me like the probleammay be in the speedo
pod.  I looked that over and all seames to be in good
shape.

Thanks again for the help.

MAtt

PS.  You were right with the 65 only stuff.  My system
as a whole is electrically the same as the 63/65.  My
re-wire kit from wire-works was for 65 only.  If i
remember correctly, that was because of the physical
location of some of the electrical parts and how the
wire were routed.  (I do not remember specifically
what it was but it seams like it was in the light
system)
