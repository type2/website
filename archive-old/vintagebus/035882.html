Subject: Radio controlled bus?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

A neighbor stopped by with his new toy. A radio controlled moster truck. 
Okay, cool and fun but I was taken back to the VW show where I saw a radio 
controlled &quot;splitty&quot;. Does anyone know where I can find one of these bodies? 
I remember the guy at the show telling me he had the bus body/shell special 
ordered and it went over the chasis of one of these monster trucks. Need to 
get one ordered for my son just in time for the holidays. So what if hes only 
2yrs old. Never to young to start playing with VW toys! ;) Daddy first!!!!
