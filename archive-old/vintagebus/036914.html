In a message dated 98-09-01 17:51:56 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; All the ones I've seen in pix go up from the base, then tilt backward,
 being mounting dead center of the nose, running the mast up the windshield
 pillar, utilizing a special rubber holder mounted on the windshield
 pillar to stabilize the mast.&gt;&gt;
 Hi Thom,
Well the upper mount should be plastic.
 &lt;&lt;This one was supposed to come from Bill Derikx's stash.  Maybe I'm
 trying to mount it wrong?  &gt;&gt;
Is it one of the Bosche antennias?  I worked a Bill's shop so know the
antennia you are talking about.  Is there a thinner metal area just above the
lower base at the bottom of the antennia shaft?  If so this area is designed
to be bent ( It is solid metal in this area.) to conform to the angle of the
windshield.  This style antennia was used on both the barndoors and up to the
mid 50s bugs and there were other manufactures that used this style of
bendable to fit cars into the 60s and 70s.
