&gt; &gt;What I would really like to find are wing nuts to fit the T-bolts to
&gt; &gt;make removing the middle seat a no-tools exercise.
&gt; 
&gt; My FLHS has metric wing nuts at least up to M6.  I think they had
&gt; bigger ones as well...if what I have is a seat clamp then the
&gt; T-bolts are M10x1.5 .  I wonder if a clutch-cable wing nut from
&gt; the later models would fit?  If all else fails, maybe you could
&gt; find some big SAE wing nuts for about a 3/8&quot; or 7/16&quot; bolt and
&gt; drill and tap them to M10.

Nope, the clutch cable nuts are too small.

Rather than retapping SAE nuts I think I would rather weld a handle to the
metric nuts.  Easier to do, since I have the welder.
