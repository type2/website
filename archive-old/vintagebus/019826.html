I say: Let there be a Bay site.  There, I said it! I did!

Anybody out there jobless/ retired/ works, but still feels they have WAAAAYYY too much time on
their hands??

The need is/ has been there.  Ugly or not... they hold their own, and deserve their own site!

I would even like to see a massive undertaking of VW integration, somehow.  I've seen many that
have tried, but failed... and many that I've erased... for dead links, inaccurate pages, TOO
massive to even use(3500 links), all the way to not being legible enough to stare at for even a
few seconds because of all the activity going on.  It would need to be for the sites that are
maintained by the people who care, vintagebus, Old Volks Home, Dropgates, type 2_dot_com, barndoor.dk,
Vw planet, type3_dot_org, etc... Does anybody know of such a useable Library of material that I've
missed out on?  I just realized that I would have a pretty decent list of links to start with,
including what I've named, and more.

That's the gospel, from Kingsport, TN

&gt; Thom I agree 100% with Kyle.  If there is a need for baywindow information
&gt; someone can start a baywindow_dot_com site.  I have maintained and driven a few
&gt; bays and they just are not that nice in my opinion, definitely not to be
&gt; considered &quot;vintage&quot; by any means.
