Sure greed is part of the hobby.The tolerance for greed, or the fine line between want and need varies by situation, observer, perpetrator. It's all entertainment as far as I'm concerned. It'll never be as bad as beanie babies, the buyer to seller ratio will fluctuate over the years. 

I can't find any reference to Manson and a VW bus. He had a beetle and planned to roam a post-revolution America in dune buggies. Guess I'll have to plumb the depths of Futurama Fandom to discover or chastize. 

Central California Valley bus owners... another attempt is being made to organize VW owners. P-mail me and I'll send details about a meeting on Monday, 11/13.
