&gt; Indeed.  Unfortunately, the wood will sometimes absorb the acid, which
&gt; can make for an entertaining time if you put your hand down and lean
&gt; against it to, say, reach the back of the cabinet....

These cabinets are only about 18&quot; deep.  They have acid-resistant paint,
so supposedly the acid doesn't get into the wood.  Of course, 30 years
from now, who knows?

The concentrated nitric acid is nasty stuff.  Nothing will contain it and
vapors escape even from a tightly capped bottle.  The storage room has a
continuously operating vent fan to prevent fume buildup.  I'm the physics
guy, so I don't actually have to use the stuff, but they had me install
the cabinets to make sure that they'll stay put in an earthquake.

&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps with a drain tube that goes down below the deck and points
&gt; back, so if there *is* significant spillage, it won't eat the vehicle?
&gt; Of course, there is an argument that says that dumping it out on the
&gt; road's not a whole lot better....
&gt; 
&gt; Ideally, you'd have a setup similar to how waterbeds are done - they
&gt; have a plastic liner that is capable of containing the entire volume
&gt; of water within the mattress.  Thus, when the mattress bursts, you
&gt; just have to deal with flashbacks to early childhood, rather than
&gt; trying to remember how to body surf a tsunami.

I'm not going to attempt any sort of drain tube on the plastic box.  The
battery shouldn't leak (never had one that did) but the box will contain
any fumes that might escape, at least until they can condense inside the
box.  The condensate won't hurt the battery or the box and will just sit
there until the next time I wash the box.  I might even put some baking
soda in the box to neutralize the acid.
