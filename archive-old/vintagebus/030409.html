Subject: Roundness of the cooling fan

Hello, list.

I have a '65 bus with a 1600 dp motor.  I have not had the bus long and
started to commute with it a couple of weeks ago so I am just now
getting used to the cacophony of sounds arising from this bus and trying
to identify the sources.  There is a strong sharp rattle in the fan
shroud or emanating from the shroud itself at lower rpms.  The sharpness
rounds out at higher rpms into more of a thrum thrum thrum.  It seems to
start vibrating some aspects of the camper interior at this point on the
road.

Checking cooling fan, I reached behind the shroud (motor off!) and
turned the alternator by hand with the belt off.  My fingers can feel
about 1/4 of the arc of the turbine to be about 1/8&quot; out of round toward
the center.  It extends from the outer rim, down the blades to the
base.  Could this cause a discernable wobble at engine speeds?  Are
these generally more round?  If it makes a difference, I could feel a
light layer of dirt caked on it.  While replacing the heater hoses I saw
some more dirt on the exit points on the shroud.  The alternator tie
down strap is tight.  Alternator shaft bearings are good.  I have tried
scooching the alternator back and forth on the stand with no change.  I
do not think the fan is brushing against the shroud.  The motor itself
seems to be running smoothly otherwise.

From what I've read, replacing this fan does not look impossible but I
don't want to replace it on just one of my uneducated hunches.  If not
the fan itself, any other ideas?

TIA

Michael
