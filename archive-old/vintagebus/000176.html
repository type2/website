Hiya we just did one on a 57 23 window we cut the frame channels loose from 
the c brkts on the back of the inner valance not easy but can be done ,,we 
actully cut the brkts off the inner valance section but we also replaced the 
inner and outter valances any way ,,,,drill out the spot welds on the floor 
section on the donor piece around the edge where it attaches to the front 
remove it then you can get to the top section of the frame alot better ,,we 
replaced the inner section with a Wolfs burg west unit ,,one piece not 5 or 6 
looks almost as good as a vw piece ,,ps if need i will try to come up with 
some pics of this but can't rember how detailed they were ,,hard to get good 
pics upside down in close quarters ,,
