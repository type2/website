&lt;&lt;You know what I'm talking about, that little hump that occurs in the seal 
at the bend in the door, just at the trailing edge of the front vent window.  
Now most people leave it there, or cut it so that it lies down flat.  But 
you'll notice og seals lie flat without cutting it.  What's the solution to 
this?  (besides trying to locate NOS seals).&gt;&gt;

My absolutly positively original seals in the 56 westy are slit right there 
so it lies flat.
Ditto:
My absolutly positively original seals in the 57 standard are slit right 
there so it lies flat.
Anyone want to proove me wrong?
