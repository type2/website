Subject: Re: Where does one start?


(!) Does it say that? That magazine is not on the newsstand here yet (I
happened to check this morning). To this day I do not know what an Eriba
Puck trailer even IS. I gather it is some small teardrop-shaped trailer but
knowing Van Bondo it is liable to be anything out of which pop dancing
girls and helicopters.

Does anybody know where Ms. Anderson can get herself an Eriba whatsit?


&gt;I finally was able to find a copy of November Hot VWs and read with absolute
&gt;delight about the &quot;rig&quot; that Jim and Paula Ellis have.
&gt;
&gt;I noticed that you played an important role in helping them find an Eriba
&gt;Puck trailer.
&gt;
&gt;My question to you: how did you begin the search?  I'm certain that you must
&gt;not know of a second one so I'll just strike out on my own if you'll head me
&gt;in the right direction.
&gt;
&gt;I have a marvelous 70 single cab, Maggie T (T is for truck!) which I can
&gt;visualize pulling something wonderful like this little trailer.
&gt;
&gt;I hope that you will have time to respond to me.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
