OK, here it is. I hate to be rude, but please only e mail me if YOU are
interested in the particular part. I always get the &quot;Thanks, I am asking for
a friend&quot; deal. If it is really for a friend, then be a nice person and buy
it for them. But if you are really not that interested in the part, or don't
care for the condition or price, tell me. I am a nice guy and will deal with
you, within reason. And I would appreciate it if you replied to
DuvBlauDKB_at_aol_dot_com

Cab Divider, comes with the felt and the &quot;U&quot; channel for the overhead vent.
It is a nice divider and I paid 100.00 for it at last years manassas show.
You can have it for 100.00

Barndoor steering wheel. It is black with a black button that has a Wolfsburg
crest. Needs a little resto and paint. I guess it is the later style, keyed
shaft, 53 and later 150.00

Hinged windshields. These are originals that are now in primer. They need
some work on the bottom inside corners. Comes with the wiper shafts, seals,
weld in brackets, dash tabs, one eyed duck screw, actually they come with
everything except the adjuster plates that go above your windshield and are
inside the bus, and the glass. 400.00

Side step. This is the aluminum step that is really popular with the older
crowds 75.00

2/3 roof rack. This is the good style rack, it has the bars that run front to
rear and side to side. Has only 4 clamps and 6 legs. I will not ship this, so
if you want it, you will have to came and pick it up. 400.00

55-66 Radio block off plate. 40.00

Westfalia roof rack clamp, later style (67). Only have one, 15.00

6 fuse, fuse block with cover. 25.00

Barndoor fuel tap. I do not know how well it works (I don't own a BD), but it
is real clean. has the screw in screen. 50.00

Hinge covers for high hinge cargo doors. These go on the top and bottom of
the first opening cargo door. I believe these were offered if your clothing
was prone to be caught on the hinges sticking out. 20.00

Aluminum, one bend shifter extension. 25.00

New exhaust tip for a 1500 bus muffler. 211 251 237A    5.00

Really nice second opening cargo door handle mechanism. It is the early
style, probably 1957 era. 211 841 705A  Looks new, but isn't. 15.00

Card board style sunvisors. Average condition, 15.00 each

High hinge panel bus door. This is the first opening cargo door, with handle
indention. 40.00

Single tip OEM bus muffler. 100.00

Crank start apron. Cut for only ONE exhaust. I had previously stated that it
was cut for two pea shooters. 40.00

Gene Berg bus shifter. Older style, not with the new handle, but the older
handle style. 75.00

That is all I can think of for now. Please reply to DuvBlauDKB_at_aol_dot_com. You
will pay for appropriate shipping. I thank you before hand.
