Now on the part of POR 15. Did you just use their regular paint but tinted
for spraying or something else? It's kind of hard to sand this stuff once it
dries. How are you dealing with this problem Gene?

Subject: [VB] Progress Report on '66 Bus


&gt; Hey y'all...
&gt;
&gt; It's been frustrating, doing this bus-fixin' thing, especially since I was
&gt; supposed to be done by September, but I know I'll love it when it's done!
I
&gt; slapped together a few web pages so I could offer curious peoples a
heavily
&gt; edited view of what I've been doing....the pages each have six pics on
each,
&gt; and are rather sloppy...let's assume, for my sake, that my bodywork is
&gt; better than my web page work...!
&gt;
&gt; Let me know what you think...
&gt;
&gt; Gene
