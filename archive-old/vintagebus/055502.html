  To all of you that have e-mailed me I'm am informing you of major mail
problems I am currently having. We have moved my server and all my accounts,
including all of my URL's have also been moved. Currently www.type2parts_dot_com
is not working properly, but www.oldvolks_dot_com is up and running. I am
recieving e-mails, but have lost quit a few in the last few days. This is
why I may not have replied to you. Also a lot of the mail to sales_at_oldvolks
was also lost. We are working very hard to get all of these problems
corrected and should have all done within the next week.

thank-you

ronnie  Old Volks of Az

ps. if whoever sees this could they forward it to the type2, vintagebus and
vintage vw lists.
