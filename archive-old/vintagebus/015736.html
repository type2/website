Knowledgeable list members - 

I am going to replace my front drums and have found
the following:

211 405 615C - listed for Split up to 67 
131 405 615A - listed for Beetle/Bus to 67

Which is correct?  Logic would say the first part
number, but when I do a search at some of the vendors'
web sites, the second one comes up as being the
correct part as well as the first.  What gives?  I
can't read the part number on the drums I just
removed, so that eliminates that option.

Thanks!
