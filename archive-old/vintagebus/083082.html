Subject: Re: [VB] 6 V starter solenoid wanted

Matt,

I have the exact same behavior in my 'new' 59 Single Cab (6V).  And it all 
started after I removed the starter, replaced the bushing, put back the 
starter, and made sure to clean all connections.  Ever since I get the same 
&quot;rowr...(pause)...rowr...(pause)...! r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-...&quot; if I am lucky.  I 
had to push start the old fella the other day... stubborn mule.

I was just looking into the Hard Start Relay's today to see if that might 
help the situation and was going to post that question to this list for 
tribal knowledge.  So, thanks for bringing it up.  If you figure it out, or 
if any listee knows what the solution is, please share.

&gt; Specifically, sometimes the starter runs like &quot;rowr...(pause)
&gt; ...rowr...(pause)...rowr...&quot; and sometimes it turns over great, like
&gt; &quot;r-r-r-r-r-r-&quot;.  This is with brand-new battery ground strap, battery
&gt; positive cable, and transmission ground strap.  At first I blamed it on
&gt; a discharged or bad battery, but then I charged the battery all the way
&gt; up, load-tested it, and charged it again, and the starter still did the
&gt; &quot;rowr...(pause)&quot; thing... _most of the time_.  Sometimes I would hit the
&gt; key and it would spin real great.

Exactly the same situation here...

&gt; A couple of days ago, it started to change its mind in the middle of the
&gt; sequence: hit the key, get &quot;rowr...(pause)...rowr...(pause)...! r-r-r-r-r-
&gt; r-r-r-...&quot;

Ditto again...

Thanks,
Greg
