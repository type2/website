&lt;&lt; Someone, I think Matt H, posted instructions quite some time ago how to do
 the mod yourself.  I adapted it to do a bug one once, but the bug setup
 comes apart differently.

The only place I know of who rebuilds steering boxes is Wolfgang in Redding.  
  I have some NOS locking collars (p/n 211 415 521 B ), that can be installed 
in a non locking coloumn to make it lock, or to replace worn one in a locking 
column, but there is dissembly/reassembly required to do this.
