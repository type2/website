Subject: Shift tube dust boots &amp; shift coupler

I have three questions about reinstalling my transaxle on my 61 Bus. I have
installed new rubber boots on the front and rear end of the shift tube. Due to
a space issue I'm concerned about the rear boot interfering with the movement
of the shift coupler and shift tube and therefore proper shifting of the
transaxle. Also does it matter which end of the shift coupler fits on the
shift tube? Flat side forward? Last thing is, I forgot to mark the spring
plate and RGB with a chisel before removal but I could see the outline of the
RGB on the spring plate and marked it with paint. Without the mark is there
going to be a major problem when aligning everything?
Thanks to anybody who can help with their expertise.
