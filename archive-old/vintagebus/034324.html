I have a 65 dbl door panel. It has a single port 1500 I believe. No
numbers on it to verify. Though it looks stock I believe it has been
modified internally. The compression runs in the 150-170 range. Maybe a
cam and flat top pistons? Runs great except when cold. Even when I let
it warm up 4 or 5 mins it still dies when stopping till its been driven
awhile. I llive in the NW so outdoor temps are mild. 40-50 degrees. The
auto choke checks out fine and mixture is ok. It has a Solex 30 pict 2. 

What I want to know is there a better carb that I can bolt on? Most
performance carbs I see are for dual ports. Also considering updating
the distributor? Any suggestions?

Thanks
James
