hey there-

first i must apoligize because this email has absolutely no direct vw
content. so now that you've all been warned, i have a question about gas
mileage and what can be done to improve it. you see, i am looking at a '57
chevy with a 350 and a 4 speed. i know that this thing is going to get
god-awful gas mileage so what can i do to change this?  i'd really love to
see a thread start on how to improve gas mileage without drastically
affecting performance.

thanks!
edmurder
