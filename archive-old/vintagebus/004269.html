Subject: Floor Screws?

Just a quickie:

I'm removing the outer 10&quot; of my cargo floor to prepare for replacement, and
I'll be POR-15ing (verb?) the rest of the floor after that.  I found a whole
lotta black plastic screws and washers that seem to be serving a redundant
purpose:  Holding a floor down that has already been welded in.  What are
these screws for?
