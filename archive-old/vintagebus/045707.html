&lt;&lt; If anyone is looking for a set of side gates for a double cab. I know of a
 set that is shorter than what is on a &quot;normal&quot; 64, at least. I would think
 that they are probably for a Binz. I have a couple of pictures of them if
 anyone is interested. No they are not mine but I can hook you up with the
 junk yard if someone is interested. &gt;&gt;

You can tell if they are Binz by that the forward most &quot;pressed&quot; rectangle 
will be shorter than the rest, and the tie down hoops for the tilt will be 
closer together in the front also.
