Unless you find that plate hunkered down in a crevice somewhere, that
record is gone.

&gt; Hi List,
&gt;  I saw the stuff about VIN's, chassis #'s, codes and
&gt; all that and it awakened a lingering question that
&gt; I've had for awhile. I'll tell the story to get to the
&gt; quest. When I purchased my '63 Crewcab, someone had
&gt; cut out the partition behind the front seat. It is my
&gt; understanding that this is where one would find the
&gt; M-Codes and all the secret codes to the life of ones
&gt; prized possessions. My truck has the chassis # stamped
&gt; in the engine compartment and there is also a metal
&gt; tag in the engine room with what appears to be vehicle
&gt; weights and the same chassis # that is stamped into
&gt; the compartment floor. The question, since &quot;the wall&quot;
&gt; was cut out and the M-Code plate along with it, can I
&gt; ever know the true bloodline of my crewcab or will it
&gt; always be a mystery like me???
&gt;
&gt; Thanks and Happy Holidays!
&gt;
