OOPS!  Typo - I meant to write &quot;mid 1962&quot;.  But I glean that is not quite
right - and I'll tell you why I thought that all these years.. and also I have
a question:

My brother has an early 1963 bug that has been in the family for its entire
life.  It came with stale air heating.  In fact everytime we have to order
things like a muffler for it, the parts houses always said that the year was
wrong, so we got into the habit of telling them that it was a 1962 model.  

Were production runs of bugs different from buses? 

Just one of those questions for curiosity's sake.

Interesting, though, about the interior fins.. I didn't know they were there. 
I had never dissected one that far down. (Read the copied message below from
E&amp;B)

Thanks

   &lt;&lt; Bug and Bus fresh-air heater boxes are the same from 1964 (actually mid

   1963)
   and 1967. They appear to be a direct bolt-in for either vehicle. &gt;&gt;
   Hi Paul,
   Not quite! The DEC62 to about DEC63 heater boxes were a smaller outlet 
   diameter, and the J-tube with exterior fins was only a round pipe inside. 
   This one yearish heat exchangers should never be used on 1500 and larger 
   engines. The later heater boxes have larger J-tube insides and interior
fins 
   which help remove heat from the exhaust not only during the cold weather,
but 
   even during the summer. Using the early one year heater boxes on later 
   bigger engines will cause the engine to run hotter during the summer and
not 
   heat your interior during the winter. This same problem, and cause are the

   same for the cheaper Dansk replacement heater boxes offered now with the 
   later bigger outlet diameter.
