Hi Chris,
We had used the 4.375 R&amp;P before in our calculations since both our parts
book and 1963 VW bus shop manual with up date pages lists this R&amp;P for 1964
and later.  So that made the differance in the RPM figures.  You really
should at the least hook up a tach and see where the RPMs are for each
forward gear just to make sure of where they are.  When you say you run your
engine at 5,000 RPM in 90F outside temps we are sceptical and not to be rude,
but have to say you have probably been lucky to not have locked it up so far
by having a freak engine and/or right conditions.  Meaning that it is the
exception not the rule.  Like the little old lady we know of who drove her
bug without a working dog house cooler for over 30,000 miles.  When the
engine finally siezed it turned out that the cooler stand had not been
drilled all the way through at the factory!  It had lasted that long due to
that fact that she only drove in town for no more than 20 minutes at a time.
Did you build this engine and what can you tell us about it?  Also are you
running oil tempature and pressure gauges?  If so what do they read at 80 MPH
_at_ 90F outside?  Any other info on your engine would be helpfull.  Thanks,
Eric&amp;Barb
