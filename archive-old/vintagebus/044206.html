  It's really funny...

  I like seeing what things people try to derive from so little information.  We build up this whole history behind the minute bits of facts that are given to us.  I am very guilty of it, too.  It makes for interesting fodder, it makes us passionate about topics, it's the basis of Love, Fear and Hate.  It's what makes us human.

  Here are some more facts...adjust your stories and assumptions as neccessary..

   The Ice Cream bus was a 1967 split window van that ended up at BBT in Belgium (www.bbt4vw_dot_com).  
   The proprietor of BBT, Bob, is good guy (opinion) and a great VW fan.
   The Ice Cream truck was a fiberglass top conversion that is common in Europe (even today with the T4 Eurovans and other non-VW vans).  I believe it not to be a VW Factory conversion of any sort.
   Based off the evaluation by BBT, the van was far too rusty to repair or restore.   This included the rockers, frame, roof (yes, the cab and rear hatch area still had the roof section) and the areas around where the vending windows were.  (that is why the windows were not in place)
   The Fiberglass top was saved and sold (I think).   
   The cut up pieces in the 'after' picture were the only ones salvagable to use for other restorations.
   In my opinion, The parts that made the Ice Cream van an Ice cream  van were salvaged (and sold?).  Sure, it was a rare bus, but not so rare that it couldn't be ressurected.  I'm sure that Bob can locate the parts for you.

   How do I know this?  I saw it a couple weeks ago when I was on vacation.  Talked with Bob directly and saw the 'after' up close and personal.  He's got a lot of other nice busses for sale including a nice 64 High Roof!  He can arrange shipment to the US.  GO GET 'EM!
