GOOD....

&gt;
&gt; 2 hp

BAD... 5 hp min (my personal opinion)

&gt;
&gt; Belt-driven

Most all are.

&gt;
&gt; 30 gallon tank

Too small! The compressor will run CONSTANTLY!!!   This makes heat and then
moisture.

&gt;
&gt; Oil-less

BAD...BAD...BAD   Talk to Thom about oil-less compressors.  Penny wise, pound
foolish.

&gt;
&gt; 145 psi max

Acceptable

&gt;
&gt; 14.5 psi _at_ 90cfm

Fair.  Its like HP, you can always not use it.  Your f'd if you need more CFM
and don't have it.

&gt;
&gt; 5-6 years old
&gt; Appeared to be in excellent shape
&gt; No regulator but all fittings appeared new

The fittings are the least of your worries.

Personally I'd look for a CAST IRON TWO STAGE pump with a minimum FIVE HP
motor (Baldor or similar),60 gal. minimum.  Even used, you'll be miles ahead
of buying a Craftsman/Home Depot/Camball Hausfield aluminum POS.  Just my
opinion though.  Buy what you want.
