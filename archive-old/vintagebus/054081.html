Subject: Re: [VB] On Balance

Hi Hart,
  No one around where I live has the adaptor either. They say its not worth 
the price ( either that or they don't know what I'm talking about). But 
there are several places that balance the tires while on the vehicle. That 
doesn't seem to be the best solution but its the best I could find.

good luck,

&gt;Greetings Honorable Bus List Members:
&gt;
&gt;Unbelievable! No tire shop in town has the &quot;spider&quot; adopter to balance the
&gt;tires on my 1967 21DLX! I get the same story, need the adopter to balance!
&gt;Is this a part that can be purchased? Or am I SOL? Any comments,
&gt;observations, or cuss words will be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Cordially,
&gt;
