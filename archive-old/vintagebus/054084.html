Subject: Re: [VB] On Balance

Hi Hart,

This probably won't make it to the list, I get bounced by the new spam
filters.

Just pick up one of those aluminum 4 to 5 bolt adaptors at a swap meet. They
work dandy, just bolt it to your wheel and they can use their cones in the
center hole. Shouldn't cost but a few bucks, and you only need one. If you
buy a  pair you can sell one to a buddy.

&gt; Unbelievable! No tire shop in town has the &quot;spider&quot; adopter to balance the
&gt; tires on my 1967 21DLX! I get the same story, need the adopter to balance!
&gt; Is this a part that can be purchased? Or am I SOL? Any comments,
&gt; observations, or cuss words will be appreciated.
