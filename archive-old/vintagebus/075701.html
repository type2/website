Subject: Re: [VB] Reely Stoopid Oil Question

Ah yes George!

I tried that 'extra something else' to keep clean, and it turned into a
major hassle, usually ending up making more of a mess - and besides, it
has to be immaculately clean to pass oil into the engine. Better to
concentrate, and have an experience of non-spillage as well as a moment or
two between you and yer bus!
