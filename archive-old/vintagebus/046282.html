...&gt;  replacing the first one, a few of the head studs
&gt;  backed out while taking off the nuts. I at first put
&gt;  them back in all the way threaded in, but they proved
&gt;  to be in too far to thread on the nut, so I backed
&gt;  them out some. When I went to torque them down, one of
&gt;  the studs began pulling out the case saver. 
&gt;  
&gt;  1. Since the case saver is pulling out, can it be
&gt;  fixed, or is the case unuseable?
-------------
do you have a case saver in there?  Sounds like you may need a new (larger 
one) installed.  What kind of case do you have- meaning what is the cases 
serial number- unde rthe gen stand.  usually only the H or B or earlier cases 
pull studs, A cases or later cases have a better alloy.   If you can get a 
case saver installed it is usable.
&gt;  
&gt;  2. After reading a post from Ronnie in the archives,
&gt;  should the threads on the head studs be treated with
&gt;  silicone to prevent leaking? 

hm- you can if you want, I never had that be an issue.  
&gt;  
&gt;  3. If no to question 2, should threadlocker be used on
&gt;  them to prevent backing out? Should threadlocker be
&gt;  used on the head bolts?

no
&gt;  
&gt;  4. I noticed an oil leak below the cylinder, which has
&gt;  orange silicone at the base. What's the procedure for
&gt;  fixing this? 

remove cylinders - marking which is which
remove pistons- marking ditto
- inspect ps and cs
at this point I would inspect the rod bearings

clean cylinder mating area on case and cylinders.  I use sealant, the paper o 
gasket, and more sealant, which I install on the cylinder.
install rods, pistons, cylinders

install heads before the sealant dries.  

so clean, then install rods, working one side at a time, put goo, gasket, goo 
on cylinders, compress rings on piston into cylinder (orient rings and 
pistons properly), installed those ps/cs, install head (with PRTubes- which 
you should have stretched out a tad) do the PRTubes seal look squishy and 
new- or do they have crucnhy bits?

refer to idiot book for details of installation/inspection
&gt;  
&gt;  5. How far should the head studs be out from the case?

far enough, not too far.  measure ones that did not pull out.  ones that are 
the same length.
