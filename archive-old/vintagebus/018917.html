Thom said in part:
If VW disappeared in a puff of smoke *today*, what
effect could it *possibly* have on the vintage VW
community, other than being a topic for endless debate
on this list and other online forums?   
Let's see:
The drying up of parts sources? 
 Nope.  
Sudden disappearance of funding for VW events?  Nope. 

The loss of support for ACVW clubs &amp; websites?  Nope.

Well, in the Minneapolis-St.Paul area, just west of me
here in Western Wisconsin, and also in Eau
Claire/Chippewa Falls, WI, just to my east, the annual
June VW shows are held in VW dealers' lots.  They move
out all of the new VWs to make room for all of our old
cars, and in addition, the monthly meetings and the
spring swap meet are also held at different VW
dealers.  There is actually a lot of support for the
ACVW hobby by the new VW dealers in the area.
And, it wasn't too many years ago that I got a new
owners manual and a bunch of special bolts, the ones
for the side gate hinges and latches, at a local VW
dealer.  Didn't have them in stock, but got them
quickly.

Maybe it's just these friendly midwesterners in
Minnesota and Wisconsin.

freezing        for the first time since Thanksgiving)
