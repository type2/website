Subject: Upper front grease fitting.  And ramble...

Small problem with fitment and the upper axle grease nipple/fitting.  Right 
now I have a 90 degree angle fitting, and it rubs a little bit on the wheel 
inner edge.  Very little around sharp turns, but still annoying.  I ground 
some of the edge off the grease fitting, but want a better solution that 
does not stick up so high.

I am guessing a stright nipple fitting will plop right on there?  Any 
experience on switching this fitting?  I am sure someone else has cursed 
this as well :)

FWIW I switched from Porsche Fuchs 15x6 23 offset to Phones 15x7 52.3 offset 
and the Phones fit better!... Look mean with the big 944 brake discs behind 
them :)

I did put in the front Bilsteins this weekend.  But have not driven enough 
to really decide how much better the ride is... But it is better, much less 
up and down seasick travel over bumps but has a smooth ride and not harsh at 
the same time.

And the Old Speed rear IRS kit should arrive this week... Granted I need to 
remove a 944 from the garage before I can even think about performing 
surgery.  Granted I still need control arms, but I think I will get 944 ones 
as they are identical to the VW ones except reenforced and 5 lbs heavier.  
Good for a bus but not a bug.


Thanks,
Adrian Pillow
