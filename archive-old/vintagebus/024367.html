I figure I would throw in an idea...I have not followed this thread
religously so forgive if i repeat some ideas...also not sure whether
this will cure your problem or not...

BUT, I found it is something that works very well....as folks know (or
not) the `58-`61 tailights are grounded to the body via a small raised
pin point of metal on the bulb housing...this is a pretty poor conection
to say the least.  I have soldered male electrical terminals to my bulb
housings (I can here the vintage purists kringe) and run a wire from
them to a ground source ie. the body somewhere....I run 12 volts with
this set up in my `61 Westy and people actually COMPLAIN my brakes
lights are too bright!!!  The say man those things are like miny
lasers!! defintely as bright as any regular automobile...it also helps
to have good reflective material left in the housings...this is much
more important then most realize....I had a rusty set no reflective
material left at all...almost half as bright as a excellent set...maybe
they could be chromed???  Just ideas..

&gt; well, this is what I did to my  6V 59 SC.  The problem was that when I had the
&gt; running lights on, the turn signals/brake lights were not very noticable.
&gt; The difference was not much.
