Subject: FW: [VB] not a public debate room!!!!!

I think I read in an earlier post that the building and parking lot where
the meet is held is not being rented
from VWOA, but from the person/company that owns that property.  It
certainly seems like a club could
officially let VWOA know that they are specifically not invited due to
recent negative AC publicity.  There  
would be a few negative side effects...the VWOA museum would be closed to
spectators, but thats a
sacrifice well worth making.  Unless, of course, VWOA has contributed a
large sum of money to put the show 
on, in which case, it would be politics as usual.  I wouldn't let the fact
that VWOA is at a show stop me 
from attending though...
