Subject: Re: [VB] nosecone bushings

You could try using a tap and then a bolt (with spacer)  and turning the bolt 
to pull the bushing out.

This is how I remove starter bushings when teh engine is in the bus.

the bushings stop on &quot;seats&quot; inside the nosecone, and they each go in (and get
removed) from different ends. the VW service manual has a cross section view 
of this, and you can see the &quot;seats&quot; in the picture. &lt;snip&gt;

if you try to press them all the way through, you'll ruin the nosecone.
