Subject: rear wheel camber problem

After much ado, I've finally have reversed my busses lowrider stance. She's now riding high and even on all four wheels. Thanks to many listees for the help.

One problem, natch.

When the bus was low the rear wheels camber was way off. After raising it to stock the bus is still extremely pidgeon toed. The tires ride on the outer edges. The bus is dead even from front to back so I couldn't have raised it too high in the rear. I have driven it and that didn't help.

Any ideas? Can rear camber be adjusted?
