I wonder if that's what beetlemex is doing; using late bug pans on
Mexican bodies.&quot;

Yes. We sell these where I work. See www.vintageonline_dot_com... A US
titled chassis is sent to Mexico where it is totally restored, then a
new car is built onto it. This is the only way we can get them into the
country... The title reflects the year of the chassis.
