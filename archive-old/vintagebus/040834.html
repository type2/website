The PO painted had my former Blue/Yellow HT deluxe, and
it was very apparent they was clueless.  I thought it looked
funny and upon checking found that he ran the lower color
(blue) into the area covered by the deluxe trim.  Hey, it
was easy!

Looked really goofy though.  Amazing what a small line of
color below the deluxe trim added to the overall appearance.

Hey Thom, just how bright is that bus, I thought I saw a 
glow from your part of the city recently!  Musta been you
on that drive!

Jeff  bussless but not clueless
