Need some tranny I.D. help.  Clara's response to my post indicated I had a
split case tranny due to the year of the bus, 1959.  I originally thought this
as well, until I noticed the gearshift position on the front cab floor.



The gearshift is located much further back on the floor than the standard
gearshift location that I'm used to.  It's approx. 2 1/2&quot; to 3&quot; (going on
memory from yesterday) from the front seat pedestal.  I was always under the
impression that this signified a crashbox tranny.  Is this a correct
assumption, or did split case trannies also have that gearshift location.

the hand brake and gear shift  are correct for your bus.   The switch to the
more forward position of the levers  was at ch # 501 707.     This was after
the switch to the tunnel case (fully synchronised tranny) at ch # 469 447 (19
May 59), but not very much .   (numbers according to book of progressive
changes by VW)   I am a little confused by what the book says about this, as
it indicate sthe shift stuff was changed later, about vin 614 xxx, which I
would have thought all was done at once.   Hm- type 215 panel vin 472 xxx (was
cut up-dead due to rust- I have pieces of it) had the hand levers close to the
seat and came with tunnel case tranny &amp; bastard 40 hp motor originally- I had
thought that was a 60 but actually a may  20 somethingth 59 buildt bus (59
model) reg'd as a 60 so fits with the info I have.  

  I have encountered confusion before of crash box / split case trannies- some
people  call all split case trannies crash box, when what I think of as crash
box was only used till oct 52 in beetles and till March 53 in buses (1st
sychronised split case trans was at ch 20-047 102), and very rare.  VW called
the crash box &quot;standard&quot; transmissions (no synchros) and the later split case
&quot;synchronised&quot; transmissions (synchros in 2nd, 3rd, 4th) and the tunnel cases
&quot;fully synchronised&quot;  transmissions.   But it makes sense to use differnt
words for different things.    

  I have generally understood the term &quot;crash box&quot; to mean the no synchro kind
that is extremely rare, the term split case to mean any with a split case-
generally being the partially synchroed kind which I also call the later split
case to differentiate from the crash box, and tunnel case to mean those we
usually see with the tunnel case (and hopefully all synchros intact).  Hope
that makes sense.   The split case (both kinds) has two halves bolted together
like the engine case, if you look under the bus and follow the seam of the
engine case forward and the tranny seam is there from back to front if you
have that kind.   The fill and drain plugs take a hex wrench rather than an
allen wrench. 

BTW, I have driven 5 (five) buses with a (later)split case, two of which being
barndoors, and none with a crash box.  I hear the crash boxes are a bit
tricky, and you have to know exactly when to shift to avoid crashing the
gears.  In the later split case you need to come to a full and complete stop
before going into first or reverse or it will grind and thrash, which leads to
rolling through stop signs or obeying them correctly.    I find them quite low
geared and good for mountain roads, and happily drove one around for years, up
and down the mountains, through rivers, on the freeways, across the country
and back.   Over Independence pass in Colorado (circa 14,000 feet high- narrow
and twisty- what it loved most, over the 26% grade pass in the Sierras, etc).
There is a way to tell the difference from the outside due to the mounting
bracket near where the motor bolts on, but I am a bit unclear on it exactly.

Also, the split case tranny has a reputation for being leaky and noisey,
particularly in first and reverse.   This I would fully substantiate from the
performance of my first splitty, an early 59, but rethought it after driving
my 53, which is actually very quiet in all gears.    The 54 had some quirks in
the tranny-  and the first 58 I drove had a really nice tranny.  The other 58
had a rebuildt split case tranny, and drove quite well.   Seems that it has a
lot to do with wear and maintenance or the lack of, and is not endemic to the
design.     With how original you bus seems, it is probably in the lower
milage category and the tranny is more likely to be in good shape.
