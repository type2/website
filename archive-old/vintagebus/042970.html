Subject: locking the spring plate bolts (fwd)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.3.96.980805001251.28315D-100000_at_well_dot_com&gt;



Chris,


You can lock your spring plate bolts on so they dont spin off again, by
getting some galvanized thin sheet steel and cutting it into small strips
which you will drill holes into for the mounting bolts. You
will need for each side, a three-hole strip for the three inline
holes, and a two-holed single strip from the center bolt to the single
bolt further up the plate. Bolt the two strips on with the four bolts,
torque everything up, then bend up the corners of the strips around the
various bolts to lock them. A hammer and screwdriver will do the job. My
mechanic taught me this - works.
