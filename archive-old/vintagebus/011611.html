TIP, a company in Ohio, makes excellent sandblasters.  I've had
one for many years, and am very satisfied with its performance.
I don't have their address handy, but they usually have large ads
in Hemmings Motor News.  Probably they have a Web address by now,
as they're a well established company.

Bill
