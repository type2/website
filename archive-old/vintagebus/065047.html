Subject: Re: [VB] bus cover?

Back in the old LENTI list days, I was able to buy a great high end quality
cover as a &quot;Factory Second&quot;. In my case the flaw was that someone had taken it
out of the box and had gotten a streak of dust on it. (OMG!!!!!-not that!)
It cost me $50. plus shipping. I think that it came from Santa Barbara, CA but
I have no idea of the address.
When I get a chance I will check and see if there is a label on the cover.
