I have had contact with 2 Brazillian bays a 75 panel and an 86 yes 86
doublecab.The panel had a 1500 singleport with way way steep gears 95KPH max
and the 86 has a really weird 1600 dp with what looks to be a singleport
until you get to the head and it has a small funny dp adapter.The DC also
had an ice pick handle on the rear door with an early style front door latch
mechanisim,no rods to the top or bottom.It had no chrome,painted door
handles.It was a delux model with air AND heat,the heat was the deluxe
option.

  So you won't get me for non split posting.I took the 59 single to it's
winter home(ti's spending the winter with a nice 58 Kombi)loaded with all my
shop supplies as I moved to a house with no garage(sucks) and it rode so
nice with a large load in it with the exception of slower acceleration.Thom
is right moving sucks when you have your own personal junk yard.

&gt; Hi George,
&gt; Pretty sure that was so, but the engine tin had to be a completely
differant 
&gt; type to mate it up to later engine compartment.   Eric&amp;Barb

Yes, that would be '72 and up.  I doubt that the '71 euro bus would have
been single port when everything else had gone to dual port.  The tin
should be the same for euro and us buses in '71.
