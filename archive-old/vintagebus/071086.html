Subject: re: Paint Job

Good news everyone! Turns out Jackson Pollock is alive and well and painting
cars in Deutschland.

&gt; From: &quot;Diane - 67 VW Bus&quot;
&gt; I have looked at about a billion pictures of paint jobs and was undecided
&gt; on what I wanted ... UNTIL I SAW THIS !!! This is the paint that I want ..
&gt; Problem is .. I don't have a CLUE how they did it or where to start.  I am
&gt; thinking it is done with an airbrush ..  Don't know how they got those
dark
&gt; lines though .. anyway .. I LOVE IT .. Now I just need to figure out how
to
&gt; do the same to my bus.  appreciate any clues ...
