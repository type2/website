Dear friends and family of Josh Rodgers,
I want to send as much love and strength your way as I can.  I knew Josh only
through the VW list and never corresponded or spoke with him, yet must tell you
how much I enjoyed knowing him through the list.  I so look forward to the
messages from the list and knew who Josh was right off when the sad news came. 
Shock and sadness rule right now but I must hope and pray that Josh has been
freed from the mighty grief and pain he must have been under, and kept hidden
so well.  I think raffling his favorite '69 colorful beauty is a wonderful idea
and I know the winner will drive and care for it proudly in Josh's memory and
honor.  I hope this blossoms into an annual raffle for BBB or such too as an
annual tribute to Josh.  It would seem a fitting honor for one who inspired so
many and one who's enthusiasm for VW's was contagious.  May Josh drive the
heavens as a happy man.
Love,
Andrea
