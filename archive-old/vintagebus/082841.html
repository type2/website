nope. factory. i see very few unbroken (have repaired or stripped 
nearly 20 front ends); i was told by a vw serviceman that a broken 
weld meant the bus would wander ...but i am positive he was making 
the logic 101
error: all buses i see wander, all wandering buses have broken leaf 
welds; therefore, broken welds make buses wander.  i suspect they 
help at assemby in factory, but don't worry about em.

welcome to my world. my last two suspects: bad rebuild on steering 
box, or the long shot - a mechanic i know speculated that worn-out 
bushings in the REAR axle carriers could lead to wandering; we just 
always assume the front.     bent axles or  rear torsion arms are a 
slim possibility. you might even make sure that the  rear torsion 
bars are both adjusted to the same angle.
