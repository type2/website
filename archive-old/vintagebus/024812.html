Hi List,
  I'm getting ready to start working on removing some old popout window
frames from my &quot;67.  Most of them are too rusted to reuse, but I'd like
to salvage enough to recycle 6 frames into 2 working windows.  My
problem is that I don't know how to get the dadgummed things off.  I
can't see any bolts or screws holding them in.  I don't want to just rip
them off cause I don't want to damage the skin of the bus.  Any helpful
pointers would be most appreciated.
  Second question.  I'm going to make some curtains and want to find out
how they're supposed to be hung.  Rods, or maybe wire?
  TIA
Rebecca
