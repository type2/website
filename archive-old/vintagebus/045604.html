Subject: WW vent wing seal frame to glass
To: VeeWee111_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Alrigth, yesterday i ordered a single piece of rubber from WW.
Its a vent wing seal for the front cab doors. I needed the &quot;glass to frame 
seal&quot; part # 221-845-295-A.
O.K., I only ordered one because I had a original piece of rubber for the 
drivers side.
I received today a 2&quot; wide strip about three feet long.
Its the EXACT same material they sell to replace the seal in the overhead 
roof vent system on the two &quot;flaps&quot; that channel the air flow.
I just got off the phone with them saying WTF is this!!???
They said &quot;originaly, VW pressed it together and trimmed the edges&quot;
O.K. while this may be true, the piece of rubber they sent me is WAYY too 
thick to do ANYTHING with!
has anyone experienced a similar problem? Anyone made this seal work?
Its about 10 times thicker than the nos piece I have sitting next to it.
Im considering driving down there just so they can see how TERRIBLE the repop 
is!
Ill probably just salvage a used piece of a spare ventwing I have.
Although i did get a stack of the popout rubber from them as well.
It seems to be better that the WCM and the BFY stuff ive seen.
