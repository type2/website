just wondering if you are using the swivel foot vave adjusting screws.  From 
w hat i understand,  it tends to be needed to shim the rocker arms out when 
using them

You can use flat washers. Try to find what's called &quot;fender washers.&quot;
They have a large OD and they're fairly thin. If you can't find those,
just use a regular flat washer. The reason for the large OD is to
provide support under the whole base of the rocker arm mount.

I looked back at your original post about this. Where did you get this
head? Is it a mail order rebuilt head? If it is, now might be a good
time to get a pair of new heads. You really shouldn't have an oddball
valve in a new or good rebuilt head. If you feel confident about the
head, just shim it and forget it. But, if you have any doubts, it's a
lot easier to get it right now than it is to fix it beside the road.
