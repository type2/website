Ronnie writ:

&gt;free charter bus going to LAUGHLIN&lt; NEV to come by CRAZY HORSE (the shows
site) to pick up people on FRIDAY night to go to LAUGHLIN, this includes
free buffet, r/t transport, and about 5 hours
&gt;in LAUGHLIN (like LAS VEGAS)and other spiffs
&gt;so if all you people arriving friday in your
&gt;buses after driving who knows how many hours
&gt;to come to BUSES by the BRIDGE I I I

Good lord, isn't driving up that road to get there in a split window gamble
enough?

&gt;BEST CAMP SET-UP cash award and trophy,
