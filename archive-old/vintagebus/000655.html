Hi Tom,
5. Get yourself at least a 0-150 FT. Lbs. torque wrench.  They are not that 
expensive and you really will need one to keep your VW operating safely.
  
6.  Sounds like you could have installed a late model TO bearing.

7.  It also might be that your needle bearing in the flywheel gland bolt have 
gone bad.  Have you ever given these needle bearings a little grease from 
time to time?  At the least when ever you remove the engine it is a good idea 
to slather a thin coating of grease over the tip of the tranny input shaft 
just to the rear of the splines to automaticly grease this bearing.  If this 
bearing goes bad the input shaft is not supported on the rear allowing the 
shaft and the clutch disc to wobble arounds to contact the pressure plate and 
flywheel irraticly.  Especially when going into first or reverse!   Eric&amp;Barb
