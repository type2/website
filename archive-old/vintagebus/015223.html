Cc: bus list &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Exactly Ev...I was a huge anti-safari guy for
years...ya know the ohh they leak and are expensive
ect..I had never owned or even rode in a bus with
them...until I stumbled across an all original bus
with original safaris...all it took was a 25 minute
drive with those babies wide open to change me!

I have never looked back since and have had a set of
one form or another on each bus I have 'kept' since
then.  I don't love em for the 'coolness'
factor...heck I live in Ohio no-one even knows what
the hell a bus is none the less safaris...I just love
that nice breeze and no glass and bugs in the teeth
feeling ya get on a 90 degree day in summer...I guess
it is kinda like harley guys I guess?

Yea, safaris leak and have problems and can make
driving uncomfortable on the occasional rainy
day...but if comfort is what one wants why the heck
would anyone drive an old split bus anyways! With
Safrais or not they leak, are slow, ride like crap and
are costly to restore...;-)

&gt; What's the allure of safari windows anyway?  You'd
&gt; think that all the talk of they leak, repros are
&gt; crap, originals are too much $$$ would just turn
&gt; people off.  
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, I've never ridden in a Bus with them open
&gt; so maybe I'm missing something...
