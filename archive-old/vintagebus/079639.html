Subject: Re: [VB] Wheel id

Gary,
 
 To the best of my knowledge Bugs never had 14&quot; wheels, so those would be bus. Bus 15&quot; wheels have four &quot;slots&quot; in them. 15&quot; Early Bug rims came in two styles; Smoothies- No holes in rims at all. (all bugs from 54-65). 66-67 bug rims are 15&quot; and have holes all the way around them, similar to the chrome &quot;porsche style&quot; rims you can buy.
