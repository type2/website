They work by evaporating water.  It takes energy to do that, and that
energy is taken from the air.  Ambient energy is measured as
temperature (heat).  So, by removing energy, you're lowering the
temperature.

How well they work depends primarily on what the current relative
humidity is.  Many things affect that.  The main one is air
temperature.  The warmer air is, the more water it can hold, so for a
given amount of water in air, the higher the temperature, the lower
the ambient humidity.  Conversely, the colder the air, the less it can
hold (this is where overnight frost comes from; the air gets cold and
the water condenses out onto whatever's handy).

Obviously, if you're near a large body or bodies of water, you're
going to have more water available for spontaneously evaporating into
the atmosphere, increasing the humidity.  Since air can only hold so
much water at a particular temperature and pressure, the higher the
ambient humidity, the less effective your swamp cooler will be -
the air just can't hold much more water.

Moving air has an effectively-lower relative humidity than still air,
so if you're moving fairly quickly, you can still get a modest cooling
effect even under high-humidity conditions.

My understanding is that Pennsylvania tends to be pretty humid,
particularly in August.  As such, I doubt one would be all that
effective a solution for you.  However, it's almost certain to be
better than nothing....
