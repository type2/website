Subject: Re: [VB] Car Scam

I think the peace loving fellow started the thread discussing selling his
bug, didn't he? Bugs are VW's and busses are VW's aren't they? Therefore
bugs must be busses, right? Isn't that a math theorem or something? Oh well.

Cops do good things and cops do bad things. Bad things like chasing down law
abiding citizens to enhance the revenue of the local PD. But we sure would
be in a mess without them wouldn't we?

BUSES legal or to some othe location or Ill get a $1000 fine each day there

&gt;I am not a fan of the police, and it feels kinda
&gt;strange that I am thinking about working with them to
&gt;bust someone, but it pisses me off that someone is
&gt;trying prey on the VW community, and if it saves
&gt;anyone from getting screwed by this person, it's
&gt;probably worthwhile.
&gt;Thoughts??
I've been trying to write a response that is something more than a flame
since I read this. Let me try this:
  The &quot;not a fan comment&quot; indicates you need to spend some time thinking
about the trash they deal with every day. Might make you a bit more
understanding and willing to help them out and you might develop a more
mature attitude about the difficult job that puts them in life
threatening situations every day. Just my thoughts
