Subject: Re: [VB] RE: The Empi Truck

i think someone should email him and see if he's interested in parting it 
out. it has a few good pieces left. he'd probably make more money that 
way, then again, there's always some &quot;aficionado&quot; that has the money to 
waste on some timeless project like this, but i wouldn't. 
there are many of his type out there and i have to say IMHO, more often 
than not, you'll find them on thesamba...simple abuse of a perfect system 
and far too many gold diggers out there, who says we've learned anything 
from the gold rush days. on the other hand, there wouldn't be any 
&quot;golddiggers&quot; if there weren't the demand for [fools] gold.
