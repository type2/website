No offense taken... perhaps I assumed the name.  Its an air powered random 
orbital sander that takes a sanding disk around 6&quot; in size.  In the past I 
had used a &quot;sponge like&quot; abrasive disk but they are to costly for large 
scale work like this.

&gt;
&gt;Not to be abrasive, what's a &quot;DAC&quot; air sander, and what is your sanding 
&gt;objective?

&gt; &gt; We are going to sand some on the 62 deluxe and 63 panel this weekend 
&gt;with a
&gt; &gt; DAC air sander.  Comments/opinions/warnings/rants (you get the idea) on 
&gt;this
&gt; &gt; tool and/or grade of paper to use?
