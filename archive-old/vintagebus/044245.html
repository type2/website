&gt;From what I've heard, The Gene Berg balanced degree pulley is the

If you are considering the Gene Berg Ent. degreed pulley, check the archives for my post entitled &quot;Gene Berg Achiever crank pulley-wrong size &quot; dated 08/14/98.  The short version is that the diameter of the GBE pulley matches the smaller of the stock VW crank pulleys.  Many motors, including 1600 engines (both sp an dp), were originally equipped with a larger diameter pulley and may find that the fan speed reduction w/ the smaller GBE pulley is an issue.  My conclusion is that the stock pulley is the best option regardless of $$ w/ either hand-made degree marks and/or a degreed timing light.
