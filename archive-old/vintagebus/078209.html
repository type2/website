Subject: Re: [VB] another RGB question

Hey Matt,

  Well, I've put together different bus parts and found out when I was
done that it was missing a part.  I've even put things together and had
parts left over.  The fact that it is dangerous, life threatining and that
it must be done right looms in the morning and night when you are trying
to go to sleep or when you wake up and are not sure what needs to be done
or *has* to be done that day.

  So, the piece you seem to be missing (if you have a bently or look in
the on line parts catalog for Rear Axle Parts - Type 2 64-67) I believe it
is called the &quot;Outer Spacer&quot; and will look like a top hat bearing shell
with the top camphered..and keeps oil from pouring out the reduction box.  
If you have a puddle of nice smelling oil weeping out of your drum and on
soaking your brake pads and generally making your beloved bus a very good
candidate for what mechanics call &quot;hidden&quot; and &quot;multiple&quot; failures
including your new RGB bearings, transmission, and brake pads.  So it does
make a difference and you don't want to be known as the person forgot his
&quot;Outer Spacer,&quot; and now had to buy 3X more $'s and smell like sulphur...

Best,
joe
