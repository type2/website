So when did they go to the vinyl covered panels verses painted? Was it after
they eliminated the pockets or was it when they changed the louvers or were
they 66/67 only. This is what I am trying to determine. Could they have been
a dealer replacement for the painted ones and were changed under warranty.
As I stated I have seen them as early as 62 (no pockets) and have vinyl
covered ones here that came out of a 64 and a 66.

Hi ronnie,
Our 10DEC62 built 63 model SC and DEC60 walk thru panel both came with the 
painted board type.  We wonder if your panels are a later (64?) set of 
replacement panels.   Eric&amp;Barb
