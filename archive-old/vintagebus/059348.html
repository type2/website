Subject: Re: [VB] BS or real

That part is not visible in any of the pictures in my 53's owners manual
It is not in the 58 bus parts list
there is no pic of it in the 56 parts list, if it is listed in German, well, 
I can't tell.

It may be a bug part.  They say it clips to the spark plug wire tube and hold 
the wire from the coil.

 I've never heard of this and it is not pictured in any of the engine photos
 in my shop manuals or parts books.
 
 Opinion? &gt;&gt;
