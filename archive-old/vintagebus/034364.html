	Haven't got the book!  Does it say what year they were
	on Steve?  On thinking about it I think I was wrong before
	and while semaphores went to 59, the separate round amber
	rear indicators were only 60 and 61, with the oval amber/red
	combination starting in 62?

	RobK


&gt; &gt; I can take some pics of the amber hella round flat
&gt; &gt; lense with chrome bezel (phew!) if anyone would like
&gt; &gt; to see them.

&gt; 
&gt; Or if you have the book &quot;Original VW Bus&quot; by Laurence Meredith, you can
&gt; look
&gt; on page 21 for a few pics of an Ausie DC and on page 38 for a close up of
&gt; said
&gt; tail lights.
