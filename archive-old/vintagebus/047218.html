Subject: Need 2 Cargo Doors 

Any locals out there have a set of cargo doors from a standard or deluxe? The 
doors on the 66 are trash. I don't need anthything but the doors themselves. 
Preferably rust free and straight.

I have nice doors on the 67 kombi but they lack the headliner things and that 
plate by the handle on the forward door. Can trade them for similar condition 
doors i need.

Dan Howard

still in the process of sandblasting, i got too drunk to continue yesterday ;P
