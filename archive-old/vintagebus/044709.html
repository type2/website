&lt;&lt; Selling this bus at a lower price without all of the &quot;goodies&quot; is one 
option that I have taken to help market the thing.  So step up if you want 
all of it or double check and make all of your inquiries with the seller of 
your next bus and clarify the deal *prior* to making the deal. After that 
then it's a separate issue.  If a vehicle is sold with extra items that arent 
there upon delivery or receipt of vehicle then that is
 called fraud. Get your deal in writing and be satisfied with what you buy~ 
then get over it.  -ellis\  &gt;&gt;

Yep.  Gotta agree.  If you are talking about taking a good running bus and 
stripping everything off of it (parts, not accessories) and selling the shell 
then the seats, engine, trans, etc. well then yeah, that's kind of a car 
whore thing to do.  If you are talking about pulling accessories off that is 
completely understandable.  I have a few things on my Binz that I have moved 
from bus to bus to bus, kind of like taking your appliances with you when you 
move.  

The other aspect is the value of the accessories can be a significant part of 
the bus.  Safaris $500, Ambulance fans - $400,  trip speedo - $300, side step 
- $100, Roof rack - $300, shifter extension - $25 8-).  There is over $1600 
and there isn't even a bus in there!  There are a lot of busses out there 
that go for less than that.  Very hard to sell a $1000 bus with $1600 in 
accessories and get $2600.  Much easier to sell separate.

FYI - I have seen the Ellis Barnambocamper.  Sweet ride and a bargain at the 
price with or without all the extra goodies.

Just my 2 cents...
