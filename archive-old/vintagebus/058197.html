Greetings Honorable Bus list members:

I drive a 1967 21 DLX with a Ronnie 1776 motor, single carb. Living in Yucca
Valley, I face the worst when traveling from Palm Springs to the High Desert
where I live: From Hwy 10 to Hwy 62 and then up Yucca Valley, I am faced
with a thirty mile long grade with constantly high head winds from the west
and then in summer, temps that reach 120 or more.

When over 95 degrees or more, and carrying a family of five (Wife and
teenagers), and the winds are blowing, I have found that I must keep my RPMs
around 2800 or lower or the temps go way up (250-270) and oil pressure goes
way down.

TO make a long story short, after talking to Ronnie, he gave me the idea of
looking into Synthetics. Well I have been doing a lot of research, and I
found that some years ago, the heat carrying properties of syns were less
than dino oils. Well, that has changed. On the average, Syns now are about
10% more efficient in heat transfer than dino oil. This means cooler heads
for our Air Cooled Vws.

Well, it got to 100 degrees last Sunday and the winds were blowing. So I
loaded up my family and some 20-50 Fully Synthetic oil in my bus and made
the loop down to Palm Springs and then up into the wind to Yucca Valley.

The results were astounding. I was able to travel at 3300 RPMs without any
oil pressure change. The Temps went just over 220, even when I took her up
from 3300 to 3500 RPMs. At one point, when the motor was has hot as I could
get her on this test, I pulled over to see what my idling pressure was. Well
over 10lb at idle at just over 220 degrees. Wow! I popped open the lid and
could hold the oil dip stick! I could never do that before!

In the past, when I hit Yucca Valley (the top of the rock), the oil temp
would usually take about 10 to 15 minutes to cool down to 180 degrees. The
temp went down to 180 in less than five minutes. Also, during the last week,
I have been looking for any signs for leaks. Nope, all looks the same.
Another side benefit, the dry start ups, are much more like starting a warm
motor, very sweet.

Well for $4.26 a Qt for only 2.7 Qts, I am switching. I am a believer! I
have a great report on syns if you want it, just e-mail me.

Hart Ponder
