Subject: 1961 Double Cab... 07-24-03

Today I went back to check my work on the fuse box for the '61 Double 
Cab. All the electronics worked. After I mashed on the horn button 
with a little more muscle it was working too. So it seems I'm back to 
having a truck that'll pass state inspection.

I went ahead and tried to mount the fuse box up where it goes. 
Unfortunately the little tab molded into the bake light broke off. 
Damn...did I say how much I had these late (to me) fuse boxes?!?!

I said screw it and ran to the hardware store. I picked up some 
plastic zip ties and went ahead and got some clips form my emblem 
while I was there. Walking down the paint isle I went ahead and 
grabbed some red spray paint to do my wheels. Unfortunately I 
couldn't find any orange Rust-o-leum spray paint, but I did find some 
yellow. So the flame job will have to wait until I find some orange. 
Grabbed a little more flat black to paint the bumpers and touch up 
the truck a little.

I've got a neat idea for the front bumper. If it works out I'll post 
pictures when I do it.

When I got back I mounted the fuse box using four of the zip ties. It 
worked great. I think they'll be good for my use...but will keep an 
eye on them.

Also, my &quot;friend&quot; who owed me the wide white walls jelly fished on 
me. In fact, he tried to milk me for some serious cash. He's lucky we 
were talking on the phone and not in person. I'm too old to get 
physical these days, but also to old to have an amatuer swindler try 
to bend me over. I was pretty pissed, and I don't mean drunk. If beer 
was in the equation it could have been ugly...but it wasn't....So, I 
let him know what he could do with his tires and got off the phone 
with him. Always someone to screw you over out there folks!

I went ahead and solved my wide white wall tire problem myself. I 
found an economical solution...not portowalls, not paint. I'll post 
pictures if it works.

Before I do anything else I need to get this truck insured, titled, 
registered, and inspected. I'm on the road tommarrow for work, so 
it'll have to wait 'til next week. Maybe I will sneak a little 
painting in meanwhile;) If things go well I'll be able to drive the 
truck next week.
