Subject: 1Ton Panel question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I was looking through Thom's really cool registry and M-codes and I saw that 
there is a code for a 1 ton bus. (M215) I was wondering what is done 
different to make it handle the extra load. I know they come with the 1500 
(after Jan '63?) , so are the brakes bigger or anything or transmission 
beefier? I drive a 1 ton Ford van daily for my job and I know everything is 
different than the Ford passenger van my dad has (is used to be a camper too!)
Thanks,
Brian
