well, well.... this is the dilema i am having right now. i think i roached 
my motor (SP1500) cruising around at 4800 rpm (60mph) too long. for some 
reason my early '66 has a small nut. my first bus having a big nut, i really 
didnt realize how high the rpm's were. so now it seems i have to rebuild, 
and i dont want to put the SN back in. i live in Ohio, the flatlands, and 
take trips around here camping, rafting and stuff... never climbing like you 
westerners. so is a freeway flier made for me? i have 195 15's on there now, 
but have ridden with 205/75's while getting the others painted and didnt 
notice much of an rpm difference. the tranny sh#i is too confusing for me 
:-(
