Subject: climbing info trivia
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id LAA30420

just some statistics I noticed on a web site...specs as per climbing ability
of a '60 bus

max speed:59 mph
climbing ability 1st-30 or 36%[can't quite read it clearly[, 2nd-13.5%,
3rd-7%, 4th-4%

I assume these percentages are slope.

pull those numbers out next time you are sitting around the vw campfire...
