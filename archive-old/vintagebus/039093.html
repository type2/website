&gt;It sounds for all the world like it is totally leaned out. What main
jets
&gt;are in the carbs? What venturi's? Emulsion tubes? When you start it
from
&gt;cold, does the exhaust get flamethrower hot almost instantly? Fatten up
the
&gt;mains and see if it helps.

You know, Kyle, that's very sound thinking.  I have no idea what
application these carbs were used for before, but they must not have
been loved since they were for sale at a swap meet.  

I completely dis-assembled the carbs for cleaning, but of course I
didn't write down what size everything was because I thought, &quot;Oh, I'll
remeber this&quot;.  And of course I forgot it all before I even had the
carbs back together.  I think my next step will be to remove them again
and strip them down.  This time, I'll make notes of what's in there.
The only thing I remember for sure was the 28mm main venturi's.

I also think I'll take them to a carb shop and have the throttle shafts
re-bushed (34 ICT's weren't bushed originally, but I understand they can
be drilled and bushed by a good machine shop).  It's an almost certainty
that they're leaking air at the throttle shafts - maybe enough to
over-lean the mixture?  Maybe that in combination with poor jetting is
more likely.

Anyway, thanks for the input - I'll keep the list posted on my progress
(or lack thereof).
