Sorry, I may have misquoted them...I don't know much about welding, soldering
or brazing, but I think my rack is probably soldered, as I don't think the
tubing parts have a tight fit, ie it is just one tube going perpendicularly
into another. I don't think they are welded as it doesn't appear as thought
the base metal is melted(as far as I can recollect, although I will recheck it
when I return).

thanks for the definitions, you learn something new every trip to the list.
