Hello Friends,

I've searched the library and the archives for this, but so far all I've
been able to find is the conversion to AL82X...

I want to replace my generator with an AL78X (with external regulator).
I'm not sure how to hook it up... I don't have the original harness
between the alternator and regulator, and I don't know what color means
what betwixt the two.

Any advice would be hugely appreciated.

david
