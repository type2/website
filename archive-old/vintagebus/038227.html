Subject: Hmm... Ever get the feeling..

Ever get the feeling your bus is looking at you. The kind if deep soul
searching look. Those faded ole headlight buckets showing the test of time,
with crows feet in the paint.  As you walk by it smirks, then when you
notice it pretends it wasn't looking.
There is an almost magical bond that forms between you and your bus when you
look into its headlights, like a man an his dog would have. Even as you
drive, you can't help notice how regal your bus looks when you see its
reflection on shop windows. It hypnotizes you, paralyzes you into a silly
grin. You feel its pain and it feels yours. You gently ease it through turns
and you pat it when it does something you though it wouldn't do. 
Busses are an extension of the driver. We don't own them, they own us. A bus
lets us drive them. We are the replaceable ones. In a way they choose us.
It's not an accident you decided to turn down that street on the way to work
instead of your normal route. You had a calling, a subliminal compulsion to
choose that route.  Then you see it in the distance, a flicker of color, the
unmistakable shape, your heart speeds up and your palms get all sweaty. It
has been waiting for you. And the current owner knows it. They sense the
automatic connection the bus has for you. It is time to move on and live
another life. There were good times but now the magic has gone and rebirth
is the only way to find happiness. All busses and drivers have been through
this.  It is the ritual, the right of passage. 
A VW bus is only one of a handful of vehicles that can stir-up these
feelings in a driver. Beetles can do it, as proven by Disney. Harley has
done it. They are special. Blood, sweat, and tears. Do we install a piece of
our selves every time we wrench on one of these beautiful creatures. 
Bumble bees aren't aerodynamically designed for flight, yet they fly. So,
does the bus hold the same ponderous question for human kind to wrestle
with. Why does it drive? Is it a force of nature? Does taupe look good with
lavender? We will never quite know the answer. But, one thing is certain. If
you ever get the feeling you are being watched buy your bus. Take the time
to give it a pat on the nose and say &quot;Thanks ole bus, you're the greatest.&quot;
