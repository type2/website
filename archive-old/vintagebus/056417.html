Subject: Re: [VB] Window scraper woes on 65 bus

I rubbed my new rubber on the doors and all pop-outs with Armoral.  It stays
longer than powder, and isn't as messy as glycerine.

Worked for me.

Subject: [VB] Window scraper woes on 65 bus


I have recently replaced the upper window scrapers (the ones of the top/side
of the front doors that run through the small metal channel they are
labelled 211-835 on the WCM site) with new repop WCM rubber.

I have found that with the new rubber scrapers installed the doors are now a
total pain to open because the rubber binds making it very diffcult to open
the door without a LOT of force. I have had suggestions such as coating the
rubber with talcum powder or glicerine (sp?) to make them more supple. I
have tried both without any measureable difference.

My expereince with WCM repro rubber is that most of it is far &quot;stiffer&quot; than
the original appears to be and as a result makes door, engine lids, rear
hatches etc etc far tougher to shut or open. On both of my busses that I
have installed the repro WCM rubber front door window scrapers on results in
the door binding considerably.

Any thoughts suggestions besides chasing down NOS rubber?/

Thanks
