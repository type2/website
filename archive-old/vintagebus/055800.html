Subject: Re: [VB] How do you remove oil filler piece?

Thanks, Dave and Karl, for the advice on the oil filler sleeve nut. I was
just struggling unsuccessfully last night to remove mine, using various
improvised &quot;tools&quot; at hand. Even though the nut is on really tight, the oil
filler head is loose and rattles around a bit. I want to fix this since I'm
trying to get the above-tin half of my engine (and the engine compartment)
to be more oil-free, and I suspect some of the oil spray and dribble comes
from this area. My '67 bus has a '73 AH-series 1600DP engine. (Anyone have a
spare OG '71 bus air cleaner set-up, with the 2&quot; air pre-heat inlet?)

I asked Ronnie of Old Volks why my oil filler head might be loose, and
whether there should be some sort of gasket in there. He sent along a metal
gasket ring in my order, which I'm guessing goes right under the rim of the
filler nut (once I get it off...). I'll look into the EMPI tool and try
again.

&gt; I gave up on that little POS tool with the two little dogs. They always
slip
&gt; off, even when I tried using an impact driver. I spent $12 for the inside
pipe
&gt; wrench made [sold] by EMPI just for that job. Well worth the bucks even if
you
&gt; use it once! Only negative I have is it needs a stop, otherwise it goes
down
&gt; past the steel collar and you dig into the aluminum.
&gt; If you can't find one locally, holler back and I'll loan it to you. [mail]

&gt; I use a piece of metal bar stock which has
&gt; the end notched to fit the tubular nut, and
&gt; turn it with vise-grips. More often than not
&gt; it requires heat to start the nut, as the surface
&gt; area of grip is not sufficient to overcome the resistance.
&gt; Heat must be applied carefully to prevent melting the filler tube.
&gt; Lubricants like CRC or Kroil help. Pretty simple otherwise.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I've been trying to remove the oil filler piece attached to the
&gt; &gt; generator pedestal.  I tried using the special tool I bought from
&gt; &gt; Busdepot but the slotted ring won't budge.  Any ideas?  The engine is
&gt; &gt; out of the bus.
