Subject: Pulled the motor out today

Hey there bus folks, just a little rambling about my bus
adventures...

Well,the sun finally came out today, for what seems like the
first time in about a month here in Vancouver, so I decided to
pull the motor out of my '66.  I'd been meaning to do it for
awhile because I need to take the motor with me to Tennesse next
month.  Yesterday I spent an hour towing the bus from the
driveway into the yard using my Toy*t*, which got stuck on the
grass frequently.  The bus is a bit hard to maneuver, since one
front wheel points to the left while the other points straight
ahead.  Turning the steering wheel, the closest thing I could get
to straight ahead was to have each wheel pointing outward a
little bit.  Unfortunately, the bus kept deciding to turn in one
direction or the other instead, much to the irritation of the
neighbours, as I was pretty much blocking the alley at the time.
Then I broke the back gate trying to get the car around the bus
and out of the yard.  Just bumped it, but the hinges broke.
Fixed it today.  Sort of.
Anyway, this is the first time I pulled the motor by myself so
I'm happy to have pulled it off with no problems.  I did have to
consult the idiot book at one point though, and discovered that
two of the four bolts I'd pulled out were the wrong two: &quot;if the
17 mm wrench doesn't fit....&quot; :-)  After that, it was all gravy!
I was surprised to find that all of the four correct bolts were
pretty loose, especially the top two, which weren't even
tightened down.
So tomorrow if it doesn't rain maybe I'll clean it up and take it
apart.  Only 6 weeks left and I'm on the road to get that '66
Westy in Tennessee.
Happy bussin'
