    I went on my trip to washington yesterday, thanks to all who replied with 
junk yard locations. Unfortunantly we were only able to visit a small number 
of them due to time constraints. We where permited to go into the yard at 
Alseth as my friend was buying sheet metal and needed to show them where to 
cut, It is mostly splits back there almost all small hatch too. unfortunantly 
mostly STRIPED. some good upper sheet metal but nothing special, my friend 
foud the corner window sections that he was looking for, that was probably 
the best of what they had. they had some stuff they wouldnt sell because they 
couldnt REACH it!! also almost all of the busses are for storage. Lots of 
glass, but at $30 a pop out I can see why.
    Any way, while we were there I went to look at a 63 dormobile, worst body 
I have seen on a driver. bondo on every panel except for the rear hatch and 
drivers door. the passenger side rear corner/side had been replaced with one 
from an earlier bus that had the outward vents and no lip on the wheel well, 
but it still has inward vents and the wheel well lip on the driver side. 
66-67 engine lid, front passenger seat mounted to plywood, 8x12 hole cut in 
the floor, Badly done home made bed, No M-code plate. UGLY bus. So I bought 
it. On the plus side it did have a strong running 69 single port with later 
bus oil bath, and a tigt small nut tranny. New tires, Plus all the electrics 
worked (except the park lights). And best of all that awsome dormobile top. 
It ran well at 60-65 miles an hour all 230 miles home without a hitch. But 
man is it ugly. I'm gonna name it frankie for obvious reasons.
    As a result I really need to get rid of my 60' ($2,500) kombi and a 63 
($750 parked sice the early 80s) standard I recently (5 days ago) aquired 
with the idea of putting a late dormobile top in it(also why I originally 
bought the 60). Both in Springfield OR. I've got suitable parking for 3 
vehicles but I have 5 busses and a ford. I hope to post pictures soon. P-mail 
for more info.
