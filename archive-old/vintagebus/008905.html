&gt; I wouldn't be so sure about that - there are tons of stories just like
that.
&gt; It's *VERY* common to pull all the choice parts off the car, then offer to
&gt; &quot;locate&quot; said parts for the buyer, in effect, getting more for the car
than
&gt; they could have if it was all in once piece to start with.
&gt;
______________

or simply buy the car, take some parts off, sell the car for more money and
then sell the parts to double your winnings.
Sounds like a winner. It hurts though when you find out about that after the
purchase.
