Subject: Re: Bus cover - PVC enclosure?


&gt; I am planning on spending
&gt;around $250 to get one of those cheapo PVC tubing and tarp car
enclusures for
&gt;my bus.  I would rather have the cover not in contact with the bus.  I
would
&gt;build my own, but I just cant find any PVC angles that would help me to
peak
&gt;the roof properly. ...

John &amp; list,

I just bought a 10' x 20' &quot;portable carport&quot; from Home Depot.  It was
$179.  The main reason for it was to keep the rain out of the front of
my double cab and provide some shade for both of the vehicles.  The
company that makes it is Insty Shade 1-800-957-6884.  It is made of
galvanized thin wall tubing and has all the angle pieces for the peaked
roof.  The roof is heavy gauge silver plastic tarp.  The day after I
bought it, it rained buckets and it did its job.

I had to raise it up so that the truck could fit under it sideways and
the bass end of it sticks out a couple of feet, but it accomplishes what
I wanted it for.

Also, the truck sits under there wearing one of those more expensive
Wolf bus covers and it DOES do a very good job.  It keeps moisture out
while allowing the truck to breath.  Got it from Wolfsburg West for
about $220
