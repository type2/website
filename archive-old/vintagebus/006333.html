A business trip has me going to Thailand for 10 days in October.  I have my
priorities, so I planned the trip to be back by the 24th for the OCTO show
in LA.  I'll have a couple free days on the trip and will be on the look-out
for VW stuff.  The last time I was there for a week and only saw one VW bus
and it was a loaf.

Does anyone know where the secret stash of VW parts is in Thailand?  Old
dealership, service center, parts warehouse, etc.  You know, the one with
all the barndoor and other elusive NOS parts.  I will be in the south of
Thailand near the Malaysian border.
