The window frames have holes in 'em that match holes in the top of the door. As I remember, you have to punch holes in the felt channels and rubber welt to let the water through. It flows down the inside of the door and hits the plastic sheet between the fiber panel and the door. You tucked the sheet into the bottom openings? Then the water will find the holes in the bottom of the doors and slide off the doglegs. 

How about a Bus-A-Day calendar? Cats and dogs and Dilbert have'm. Picture on the front and a blurb. How about the WebShots daily wallpaper that everybody has installed from our internet LAN connection. Can we get royalties to keep a listserver or AIRS alive?
