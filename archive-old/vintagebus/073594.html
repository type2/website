Subject: Re: [VB] Glass-to-Frame Popout Window Seal Cupping

Last week I installed the CE popout frames with WW seals, I used the original
glass, some hand soap, and two very large rubber-footed clamps, and they are
in.  I did have one frame strip out the screw holes where the popout latch
attaches (called Mandy, and a new half frame is on it's way, they said that has
never happened before, guess I need to keep my wife from closing the popouts).
Also broke a safari latch, they are sending a new one of those as well, they are
making steel ones which should be ready in a few months.
