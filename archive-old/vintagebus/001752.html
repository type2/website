Subject: busted shock mount!
Date: Tue, 21 Mar 2000 17:13:22 -0800

Pulling into my driveway last week, I cut the corner a little short and
hopped the curb with my right rear wheel. I heard a clunk, but thought
nothing of it. So today after work I'm adjusting the brakes and after
pulling the right rear wheel (I have those white &quot;baja&quot; style rims with no
adjustment hole, so I've got to pull the wheel off to adjust them) and I
can't believe what I see! The upper mount on the shock absorber is not
welded to the frame anymore! It's still bolted to the shock, but just
floating there in mid-air! And it's the cleanest break - the weld stuck to
the mount and the place where it mounts is smooth as hell...errr...smooth as
a bell. Actually, it welds to the outside of the engine compartment, not the
frame. What a bummer :-....(   Guess it's time to find someone who can weld.

BTW - speaking of adjusting the brakes, an old German VW mechanic in Santa
Barbara once told me: after adjusting each shoe, hop in and give the pedal a
good stomp or two - kind of resets everything - then go and check again and
readjust if necessary. I haven't noticed much difference when doing this on
old brakes, but after installing new ones (or changing anything inside
there) it makes a difference. It kind of sets everything back into &quot;working&quot;
position.
