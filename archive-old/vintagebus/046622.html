serves, he was telling a story about a bus he bought via a newspaper ad that
had a typo (the &quot;h&quot; was missing, therefore &quot;gas eater&quot;).

yup - that's the bit in the book I was talking about, and perhaps is was a
typo in the ad, and perhaps it wasn't.    It was only after driving that bus
on a trip to California (admittedly the only one I have driven with an
eberspached bn-4), one tank full with the heater on, the next with it off and
saw a big difference  then I thought it really was a gas eater.
 . . . . . . .
The gas consumption of the heaters really isn't debatable, the fuel
consumption specifications in the manual are for a tuned heater, just like
the specifications VW gives in their manuals for a tuned engine.

well,  I debate that. As we know, we get varying milages in out VWs, whether
or not VW says what it should be.    I have driven around with varying from
31mpg to 17mpg (differnt buses) tuned up with 1600 sp motors.     I never
messed with the gas (h)eater itself, as it wasn't my bus and  I didn't
actually drive it all that much.   It's great to hear that your heater works
more efficiently, esp as you probly want it more in the NE than here in the
NW.  I know a guy who has a BN4 in his 70ish camper, he and his wife have a 3
year old kid, and they camp a lot and use the heater primarily for camping
(switch by bed so it can be warm before getting up in the morning)  Don't
remember if he mentioned  fuel consumption.  But I have talked to people who's
bn4 seems to use anoticable amount of gas.     Still, it  makes life a bit
more cosy.
. .  . . .. . . 
I also hope this post doesn't sound too cold (hehe).  I feel there is a lack
of knowledgeable voices on this subject, and it does every freezing bus
owner a disservice to offer misleading information about them.

 I'm glad you pointed out where people can go for info on BN-4s, as you seem
to know more than many about them.  (I may check this out as I have a BN-4 I
may put in my camper, and hope to make it work more efficiently that the other
one I mentioned).   

 But Really, that bus did have a gas eater, and whether or not that was the
ideal, that is what it was, and I posted my experience  and I think that is
fine to post, labeled as my experience with the eberspacher.    I am no
eberspacher expert,  but it is not disinformation.  I can't help it that that
is what it did, and I would have liked it if it used less gas, but for
whatever reason it didn't.   So there.  

  I tried a bunch of things to raise the milage in that bus from 17- rejet
carb, change dist, tune up, etc etc, and another bus got a lot more all the
time, but it isn't too clear to me why exactly , through I have sorts of
theories about gearing, carbs, compression ratios, driving style, etc etc.   I
guess sometimes if I post something about my own experience, even if I
specifically put in a disclaimer that it applies to this bus only, as with the
rpms at speeds in my 61, people can skip over that part and take it as
universal.   Don't know how to address that.
