turn the differencal(sp?) around.
Hi Richard,
Can be done if you flip the differential ring gear to the other side if you 
are going to install RGBs.  If you are using the non-alpined geared 1959-63 
RGBs you will go from 47 MPH to about 42 MPH _at_ 3,000 RPM, and if you use the 
earlier 1955-59 RGB gears you will even be lower geared!!  This will make you SC a 
real winner at pulling out stumps and plowing the back 40 acres, but not very 
drivable on the higher speed roads of Teeexxxaaasss.
