Subject: interior trim Q

Has anyone ever tried to clean up there interior trim?  I was working on
that the other day and was wondering what they were made of.  I do not
think the are aluminum as it was very tough and did not pollish worth a
darn.  any input there.  I am thinking some sort of steel and maybe
plated.  If so, anyone know if they can be re-chrome plated?

Some of mine have lot's of scratches that i would like to clean up.

Thanks
Matt
