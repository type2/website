Subject: RE: [VB] Replacing front window rubber

Dave,

I posted this to the list so that others with experience can chime in.  I
have never used the tar or any sealant before which is probably why I have a
problem with rust now.  The string is to be applied once the seal is on the
window and is wrapped around the channel where the window frame lip sits.
The idea is the be able to press the window into the frame while pulling the
string thus slowly pulling the inner lip over the frame until the window and
seal are fully seated.  I usually wrap the string in the channel two times.
I expect that the cotton string will be covered in tar as I pull it out but
the gloves will keep it off of my skin.  Any tar mess can be cleaned with
mineral spirits, goof-off or lighter fluid.

Regards,

Thomas

Thanks for the info on windshield rubber project. I also will be doing
this as soon as I get all items acquired. One question about the roofing
tar: I can visuallize this tar getting all over as I wrestle with the
rubber and sindshield. Do you give it a nice thick neat coat all around
the edge that is covered by rubber to all a sticky surface for the
rubber to adhere to? Any thoughts on how to keep it from getting all
over? Also I can't quite see how to use the string. I suppose one just
has to learn by doing but any additional guidance on this project would
be appreciated.
