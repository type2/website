2.   It is not cool what you've done to your rep with some 
other VERY reputable  people on this list.  I'm honestly surprised 
you have the bones to  post here.

So its ok that whiny can put up a web site of lies about me but as soon as  I 
say something about him then I'm the bad guy,
 
well understand that I could write up a web site that makes him look like  
scum he is sense I DID LIVE WITH HIM FOR A MONTH. 
 
I have proved he has lied many times about me and that I have not said one  
thing about him that's been false.
 
as far as having the bones to post here what gives anyone the right to say  I 
can't, when I 'am sure I have helped a lot of people. I have been driving and 
 working on air cooled VW's for 27 yrs now. I also run a very successful VW  
repair and restoration business so I feel I have as much right as anyone  else 
here to post.
