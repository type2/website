&quot;Chuck Wagon&quot;--The black belt is not for Karati--Been fighting a pinched nerve in my back for close to two years--Still looking for a saw bones who can relieve the pain---It sure was a very productive week-end on the Raffle bus--I think i set a new world's record for hours on the sand blaster!! They knew TWWM could not screw that up! Trust me the 4 backing plates for the brakes are ready for concourse show.
Kyle as always was the most VWonderfull host with his partner Dede. Wednesday night at the ABC meeting we came up with a killer t-shirt design
Thanks to

This 10th Anniversary Jerome Jamboree will be a Goodie--The ABC web site by Everett Barnes, really helps a ton--It was really super cool to see the group that spent the week-end at Kyle's working on the bus.  At times there were people, under--inside-- in front--in the back-
all at the same time, making this Raffle bus grow.  Somehow every year the Raffle bus just gets better--See all of you Sep. 16-17  Bring your $$$ for a great Raffle and an Auction!! Start saving now--You will not be disappointed, TWWM, uj
