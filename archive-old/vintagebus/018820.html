To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Given: all wires have been replaced. New female spade
connectors are tight on the male prongs. 

Loose connection or bad switch (button). A wire is
grounding somewhere to complete the circuit. 

If new wire then insulation should be good. Leaves
either end. I'd bet on the connection to the horn
button or the button its self. Have you used that
button before and know that it's good? Do you have
another button to isolate the button as being or not
being the variable? Do simple R&amp;R on the button if
connection proved to be tight. Ask if it happens only
when turning the whl or stationary? When does it
occur. What could make it occur? Why bad thing have
you done recently to draw the bad energy onto your
line? What upset your Xi? (Chee) What would LRH do?
Cast a pebble into a still pond and meditate on being
one with the system. Play some Allman Brothers ;-)
At won't have to worry about some smart aleck making
comments about the horn blowing and taking it to the
next level~ if you know what I mean...
If all else fails disconnect and use finger out the
window and pack a nine ;-)
