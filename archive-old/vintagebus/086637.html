Subject: Re: [VB] Firewall between tank and engine on a split?

The &quot;firewall&quot; enclosure was introduced on the Bus sometime midway during
the 1968 (Bay Window) model year.  VW's intention was for noise insulation,
not so much the &quot;safety&quot; aspect.

I drove a 67 Deluxe 21 Window for over 30 years without ever worrying about
it.  Since the filler is already welded to the tank and the filler opening
is on the outside with the overflow drain, chances are pretty small you
would ever have an &quot;engine spark&quot; problem, except of course for leaky fuel
hoses/lines, which should be inspected periodically for cranks or leaks.

YMMV

&gt; Volk-A-Maniacs,
&gt; So, my sister-in-law bought a '70 bus (I might forgive her someday).  I
&gt; was
&gt; checking it out and noticed the firewall between the gas tank and the
&gt; engine... then started pondering how that might work in my '63
&gt; panel/camper.
&gt; Any thoughts on how adding such a thing might screw up the
&gt; airflow/cooling?
&gt; Has anyone done this before for safety reasons?  Or other reasons?
&gt; Is it a stupid idea?

&lt;SNIP&gt;

&gt; Thoughts?  Opinions?  Flames (pun)?
