Subject: Build your own engine, here's why!

Back, a year or so ago, when I was a newby, I decided that my limit in
restoring the '63 bus would be the engine. I did not think I would or could
learn enough to build an engine. With all the body and electrical and other
million things to do, I would hire a well reputed engine builder. So, I got
my engine and hit the road. I was VERY happy with the engine. It was quick
and reliable and seemed solid as it could be.

A week ago I threw a rod.

The oil was low when I checked it, but barely a quart. Still I took
responsibility and admitted that I ran it low on oil and killed it.

After estimates of $800 and a couple of weeks to fix it, I decided that it
was time to take on the last part of the bus and rebuild the engine myself.

Never being in the engine before I don't often know what something looked
like when it was right, but I thought it strange that there was no pressure
on the spring in the deep oil pressure relief valve. I had to use a
screwdriver to get the spring out. After asking around I leaned that THERE
WAS NEVER A PLUNGER IN THE OIL PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE.

I have been using this engine as my daily driver shop truck for over a year!
I have put more than 10,000 miles on it. Hard freeway driving!

Everyone is telling me that it should have died almost immediately.

So, the moral is: Build it yourself.
