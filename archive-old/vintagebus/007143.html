Hi guys,
I have a bus that has awesome original paint that buffed out really shiny.
Problem is I'd like to fix the 1% or so with some early signs of rust- under
the windshield etc. I would prefer to keep the original paint and have a few
spots ground, dings fixed, and some paint sprayed without doing an entire
paint job.  Is this adviseable or will it look ittyshay overall? The bus
looks really good as-is, but I'd like it to be near perfect and prevent
further rust down the road.  Thanks for the advise.
