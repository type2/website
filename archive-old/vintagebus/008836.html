Scott,
I found one that has a metal collar over the rubber part so even if the
rubber gives way the collar holds the shift rods together. Check with
Ronnie, at www.type2parts_dot_com, maybe he has them.

Subject: [VB] My rear saved by Zip Ties


&gt; I was at a stop light this afternoon on the way to my daughter's swim meet
when
&gt; disaster struck.  I put the DC in gear and the linkage came loose.
Figuring that
&gt; it had popped out, I got the truck pushed over to the side, rolled out my
&gt; &quot;emergency repair mat&quot;, slid under the DC and found that the rear shift
coupler
&gt; had exploded into two pieces.  Everything was still there, but wire would
not hold
&gt; it together to allow shifting.  I cut the wire off and aligned everything
and
&gt; tried to figure out what I could do to make it operational.  I hit on the
idea of
&gt; using some of the zip ties in the tool box.  One that went between the two
set
&gt; bolts to hold everything together and then a half dozed wrapped around the
&gt; circumference of the coupler to hold the first one in place.  Ended up
working
&gt; like a charm and I made it to the swim meet ON TIME and back without
further
&gt; incident.
&gt;
&gt; On the way to the meet, I was a little apprehensive about the quality of
the
&gt; quickie repair, so I left it in third all the way.  Light DC + the 2L type
IV =
&gt; amazing lugging power when needed.  On the way back, I gingerly went
through the
&gt; gears like normal and it worked fine.
&gt;
&gt; Question:  The coupler that was down there was red urethane.  Why aren't
they made
&gt; out of metal?  Does that much vibration get absorbed by the non-metal
couplers?
&gt;
&gt; Looks like I'll be out coupler shopping in the morning.
&gt;
