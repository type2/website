Subject: Re: [VB] Crank History w/OCTO P.S.

Lets face it VW stayed with things that worked!  Crank starting works
(even if it is just a back up), generators WORK (abet not as consistent
or strong  a power source).  You know the saying , if it ain't
broke......

Sure all of those things could have been added, but the car/bus was to
be as cheep and functional as possible.  The ultimate LOW TECH.
Besides, look at what they came up with when they &quot;modernized&quot;  ....the
rabbit and the fox.   Yuk!!!!

&gt; Hey all.
&gt;
&gt; I just watched Modern Marvels on the History Channel
&gt; (one of my FAVORITE networks) it was an episode on
&gt; electricity in cars.
&gt; In America, the Starter was used in every car by the
&gt; year 1915.
&gt;
&gt; So then why the heck do VWs have cranks and crank
&gt; aprons into the mid 1950's??!!  as backup?
&gt;
&gt; (By the way did you know the term &quot;being cranky&quot; comes
&gt; from someone who was pissed after a series of failed
&gt; attempts to crank his engine.)
&gt;
&gt; Also, alternators were first used in 1960.  Why did VW
&gt; not use them until almost 10 years later?
&gt;
&gt; Don't get me wrong, I love VW engineering. But when
&gt; you look at it this way, they seemed late to let go of
&gt; some things.
&gt;
&gt; P.S. Look for me at OCTO: Black 21 window with red
&gt; trim. Here are some pics I put on Everett's site. I
&gt; just took my family to the beach for the first time in
&gt; DARTHVW. (BTW, I found him through Everett's
&gt; classifieds last July!)
