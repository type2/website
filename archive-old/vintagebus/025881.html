&gt;   It all has to do with elements
&gt; called thials - the active ingredient in skunk spray and male cat urine (as
&gt; if you wanted to know.)
&gt;
&gt; So is there any bonifide way to rid the bus of this smell?  Anyone had
&gt; experience with getting this stench out of an old vehicle?
&gt; :-)
