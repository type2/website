Subject: dash color/was [VB] bus question?
To: evens_at_la.magnet_dot_com, andy_at_lenti.type2_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


It seems that this was taken at a different approach. Two tone buses in
the 50's had the bottom color as the interior color. starting in 59 bus
interiors I think were painted using the top color. Also 50's buses were
dark on top and light color on bottom, 59-67 buses were light on top and
darker on bottom.

er- the dash was the bottom colour April 61 when my 61 was made.   The change 
was made in late 61/early 62 sometime.   Anyone with later 61s or early 62s 
want to comment on their dash colour being the top or bottom colour?
