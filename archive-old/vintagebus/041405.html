&gt; hey all
&gt; the bearing is STUCK on the axle shaft...and its stuck something good.
&gt; is there anything I can do to get it off?  short of cutting it off that
&gt; is...
&gt; a puller won't fit back in there to get it off

As I recall you can use a block of wood or drift on the back of the
reduction box cover and tap it off using the outer half of the reduction
box to push it off. Anybody to verify?  I've always used the $200 special
bearing puller though.
