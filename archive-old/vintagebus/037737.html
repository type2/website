60 seconds flipping through a Hemmings Motor News turned up S &amp; M Electro-Tech email garysum_at_webtv_dot_net as a company that would repair your clock, there were about 25 different ones. way back when, I had a bus with a clock. The ticking drove me nuts at night when I was camping in it, ripped the guts out of the sucker and installed a battery powered quartz movement from the craft store, kept real good time, not that i'd do this now, but hey i also helped greg taylor cut the wheel wells on his 58 panel, we put on a set of paddles and raced around on the beach, in the surf and across logs.
