yeah, it becomes a real bugger (as I found out when I rebuilt the engine
last summer) when you cant walk around the engine, or cant sit sit square in
the middle of where the engine is _supposed_ to be.

Happy New Year, and good luck applying the Y2K updates to your busses!!



&gt; Oh sure,
&gt;
&gt; everybody decides to start a thread about 17mm hex tools the DAY AFTER I
go
&gt; out and buy the L-shaped wrench.  I haven't had any trouble getting to the
&gt; plugs on my RGB's, or the tranny.  Oh wait a minute, that's probably
because
&gt; I don't have an engine in there yet ;-)!

&gt; &quot;Whoa! what happened back here!?!&quot;
&gt; Actual quote from a guy looking at the gaping hole in the rear of my bus
&gt; (engine hatch lid is detached).
&gt;
&gt; &quot;That's where the engine goes, Joe.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Oh, okay.&quot;
