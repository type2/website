&lt;&lt; I can get my hands on some of these drawings/blueprints (I forget what 
they're actually called...the name is on the tip of my tounge) and would like 
to have
 some of these tools made up.  Would this be possible?&gt;&gt;
Hi Isaiah,
Yes!

&lt;&lt; Would it be impossible to find someone to make these...or be outrageousely
 expensive?&gt;&gt;
Depends on which tool!

&lt;&lt; I suppose I could make them myself...&gt;&gt;
Yes, if you have the tools, experience, and knowledge to choose/find the 
right materials.

&lt;&lt;Has anyone ever done this before?&gt;&gt;
Yes.

&lt;&lt;This might be a violation of patent laws? &gt;&gt;
Only if you were to mass produce them and try to stock every FLACPS in the 
world would you most likely run into problems if VW patented any of them.  If 
you do it for yourself or a few others you should have no problems.
