Subject: melling, schadek or febi...

...oil pumps?
I pulled the pump in my 1600sp to remove the lost dizzy shims, but marred
the housing, so want to replace it - it was a febi.  My spare is a Schadek;
major difference appears to be in casting ribbing and the fact that the
Schadek has two 'sumps' next to each inlet/outlet, and the febi was flat.
Any one have any comments one vs the other?   Any reason on Earth I would
use a Melling? I have a moustache bar, so think that precludes it
anyways...

Oddly, no comparisons were found in the archives - let's rectify that :)
