&gt; and a VW--how can it be ugly??  Although i can understand--I get a lot
&gt; of flack with my 63 VW Hearse--seems that's ugly as well--the last show
&gt; i was in--the judges said it was Not a real VW bus!! they could not
&gt; decide what class to put it in as they thought it was Not real--The
&gt; Frickinger Coach Built Badges on &quot;Drakula&quot; had no effect--still not a
&gt; real VW bus!--But &quot;Life&quot; does go on--Even in a Real VW Hearse!!!--TWWM,
&gt; uj
The only difference between a Bus and Hearse is.  Buses carry the
living, Hearses carry the dead, except for the driver in some cases.
