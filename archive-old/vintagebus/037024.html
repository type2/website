In a message dated 98-12-04 11:26:35 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; B42 is a code for the SO-42 Westfalia camping interior
 
 UJ is the port code for Honolulu for earlier buses, but may be Jacksonville 
    for later buses (I have never seen written confirmation of this)
 
 523907 is the color code for Pearl White upper and lower body colors and 
    mesh gray front seats.  The Westfalias &amp; other special models had a 
    unique color code system.  The Westys were made from Kombis typically, 
    but were painted differently than a regular Kombi.  A regular Kombi 
    was only primered inside the rear cargo area and the Westys were 
    painted inside the rear cargo area.

Dave ,

Thanks for the comprehensive answer. I didn't realize the Westy's had a
different coding system.

Thanks again- Jerry
