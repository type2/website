There's no e in Kombi
 right got it.
Once out of Texas it seemed like the rest of Louisiana and Mississippi
went by in a flash.
The porta-solarshower he used to clean out the Texas grime was lost in
Clearwater FL.
(strap that puppy down or you'll lose 'er on the turns) Our stayfaring
wanger er wayfaring stranger got himself all spiffied up with the help of
Goodwill and  the last chance thrift store. No dress code violations for
our bible student. No Sir.
The bus was soon put into service as a ferrie for wayward (way weird
after he fixed em up and put em on consignment) bicycles that were
therapy for  our Hero between classes. There is nothing quite like
building a wheel by hand; start with a bunch of wires (spokes)and a
couple of round things (a rim like a hoop, axle like a stick) and voila!
humankind's greatest invention, from nothing something, clay for the
potter, pen for the poet, parts for Porsche, arrgh somebody stop me...
On other occasions the Bus could be found full of slimy specimens for
Invert Zoo Lab.
Sunset beach park was the ideal place for our hero's bus no one bothered
it while he went for the morning swim with the manaties and the wilier
silverhairus socialcureitus receptucus. Or while he schooshed mud through
his toes and sniped for nudebracia, the Bus held his towels and fended of
all cracker types with its hippiekarmaura natural good looks.(free ice
cold showers at the beach no need solashowa)
The Bus held him in its womb and sheltered him through  the night  while
he listened to Art Bell or watched the Bucs kick butt via the magic of
12volt DC. It was the only vehicle in the school parking lot with
California plates the students knew the bus better than our hero. The
professors are still cracking jokes about it; using it to illustrate
oxidation even though our hero is long gone from school.


(one more preface instalment to go.)
