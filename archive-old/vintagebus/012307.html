Ken, 
 How about using ski/roof rack clamps attached to the rain gutters? I envision two on the front (one near the base of each antler), and one on each side, maybe half-way back above the front doors. These would all be attached to a metal strap (ooooh!, section of dead junkyard bus roof for proper curvature!)with rubber underneath to prevent scratching.Just might work.
 ...and to think I gave up architectual design to teach music!!?
