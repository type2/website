Subject: Curtains???

Here is something to ask about....

I do not know when Westys had front curtains installed with the little 
clips, probably nylon, to hold their curtains up. They had stops at each 
end with screws. What is the replacement? I have a 63 with front 
windshield curtain &quot;slides&quot; for lack of a better word. What do I use to 
replace these with? What have you used?
Is the clear? I am not sure it is. But if you know what I am talking 
about tell me what to do! Maybe mine are later like a 70 or so. I am 
more mechanically minded then interior, but I want to figure out how to 
put something into the slots.

Jason
