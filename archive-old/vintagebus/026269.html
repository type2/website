    There's a place here in Chicago that blasts anything imaginable.From small
items to city dump trucks.
They have a rotisserie for cars in which it adjusts to different sizes and
hoists the car and spins it to make the job easier!!!
I have used there services often and one day I asked the foreman , &quot; how much
to blast my bus?&quot; he thought about $500.00.They had done a bug for a friend
for $400.

            Good Luck,
                                woody
