It was me. The blades I use are the ones from the older Land Rover with the
split windscreen. Basically all Series I, II and III Land Rovers take the
same blade. This blade is probably very similar to early Jeep blades.

I find that the Land Rover blades just slide right on to the bus wiper arm.
One can't use the stock holding clip, so I just use contact glue to make
sure the blades don't go flying off in the rain.
