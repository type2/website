Subject: Re: [VB] two weld q's, one spec to DC

&gt;In a message dated 10/5/2001 2:41:34 PM Pacific Daylight Time, stevo_at_efn_dot_org
&gt;writes:   &lt;&lt; i am now entertaining the notion of removing the two rear (rir)
&gt;p/u bed sections to remove the BIG divits where the 800 pound gorillas got
&gt;comfortable during a tailgate party. can somebody list the generalistics on
&gt;how this may be done. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hi Steve,
&gt;If these areas are less then 50% of the total area of each of these panels it
&gt;might be more worthwhile to cut out just the damaged areas and weld in new
&gt;material.
&gt;Eric&amp;Barb

the world would really be my oyster if i could pound out two or three
&quot;half-a-square foot&quot; divits above the engine compartment so as to avoid
standing puddles
