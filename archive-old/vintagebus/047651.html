Subject: Looking to buy a '67 or earlier bus

Hi everyone. I'm new and since it's Friday I thought I would post this. I am
looking to buy a 1967 or earlier bus for a daily driver. It doesn't matter too
much what model it is as long as it isn't a Single or Double Cab. I'm looking
for one that is in decent shape, i.e., not too much bad rust or body damage,
good running/driving condition. I live in San Antonio, TX and could probably
travel throughout most of TX to see one but I would rather buy one close to
home if I can. You know, Austin, Corpus, etc.
If you have a bus to sell, and you live here in TX, let me know.
Steve
