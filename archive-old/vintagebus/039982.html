I went to the local hardway store and bought a short bolt with a 17mm head 
and 2 nuts to match.  put both nuts on &quot;locking style&quot; tweak 'em good and 
you have a tranny tool  that takes up no space whatsoever.  An added plus is 
if a pesky engine mount nut mysteriously falls off you have a spare.  Pay 
the extra $ if you like shiny things and get stainless!
