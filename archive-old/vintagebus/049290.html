Just happens that I used my jet-set from CB Performance (CB=Claude's Buggies) last night on my baby Dells on the DC. The guages are German, but have plastic holders for the metal guage. They are only 1/4&quot; long and won't fit into the air jets I have for the larger Dells. The reamers are tapered so don't have size markings, that's what the guages are for. Guess I could take a picture of 'em and post on our favorite web sites. I did no comparison shopping, maybe you should. 

Karl stopped by even though he's sick, and had words of wisdom as always .  My mains were 1.28 and about 1.31, so I opened them both to 1.50. My 1835 is fine in flat Fresno, but bogs down when I escape this huge valley. 
Thinking about it now, I should have pulled the jets out of the plugs to ream from the other side so the taper went smaller towards the carb throat instead of larger. 

People sell holes all the time, but it'll get you 30 days for a second offense in Fresno. 

Any listees know how to weld polypropylene plastic? Todd? Pam? I need battery boxes for my electric Thing before too many holes appear.
