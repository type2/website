Subject: Re: [VB] Bushing Reaming question

&gt; I THINK I can handle everything
&gt; except maybe the reaming of the new bushings, my
&gt; questions refer to this.  First of all, is a reamer
&gt; a standard tool I can pick up at my local Home
&gt; Improvement Warehouse for relatively cheap, or is it
&gt; a specialty tool taht will cost me big bucks and be
&gt; hard to find 
&gt; 

IF I had to do this without the correct tool (a 24mm
reamer), I would use a 15/16&quot; American one and then
brake cylinder hone.  I don't have time to do the
math, but I think it's pretty close.  Around here, I
jsut borrow the correct one.
