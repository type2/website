&gt; BTW, what is a good chrome polish on the market?

At your FLAPS you'll find polish in the car wash area that says it's for
chrome and mag wheels. It's just extremely fine grit polish. I've used
it on aluminum and chrome and it does not leave scratches, at least not
scratches you can see without a microscope.
