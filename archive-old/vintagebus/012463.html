Hello All, 
  Just a quick question for whoever might know, or have a good idea
&quot;why&quot;:)
  Its seems that every &quot;For Sale&quot; sight on the net, and the ads volks
post out of there local paper, are all on the East coast, or West
coast. Why? I would go as far to say that 90% of all buses are in
those areas. I mean here in the DFW area the ONLY time you will see a
pre-67 anybus is in a showroom or at a local show. Ive traveled a
quite a bit in TX, LA, AR, OK, NO BUSES:( Dont get me wrong, theres a
&quot;few&quot; but not like the bus population you coastal people have. Of
course we know why there arent many left in KS, right Rick?&lt;lol&gt; 
  Now I realize there were only a few ports they couldve came in on,
East or West, but was there just not that many of em that made the
migration to the central USA? Or Mabey in the 60s during the &quot;Flower
Power&quot; movement all those beautiful people found only buses to
transport them to from beach to beach, abandoning them there on the
sand when the pilgrimage was complete? Or possibly the &quot;Draft Dodgers&quot;
took flight in em headed for the Canadian border never to return?
  Not only does it apply to splits, but for lo*fs &amp; Van*gons also, but
those arent the ones were worried about, are they:)
  So if ya have an idea, throw it out there to me, I would really like
to know &quot;WHY&quot;:)
Later
