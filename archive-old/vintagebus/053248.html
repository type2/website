Subject: Heater tubes (new item)

   I just had a bunch of conversion heater box to body tubes made up. These
are the tubes that go from the heater boxes to the body eliminating the
metal muffler. These are 60 mm on the heater box side (for those using later
heater boxes) to 50 mm on the body. They are plastic accordion style with a
fiberglass liner to eliminate the engine noise.
