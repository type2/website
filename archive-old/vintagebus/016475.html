I wrote earlier...

Here are the facts,
1600 DP engine (I think, no numbers on the case)
Standard tranny not Freeway Flyer
Weber 32/36 progressive carb (recently rebuilt to kit specs)
glass pack exhaust system

Only getting 12.5 mile to the gallon. (Don't know what it was before the
carb rebuild.)
Oil filler cap smells distinctly of gas.

What could be the problem here? I'm scared that the oil is getting thinned 
out and could cause me to burn up an engine. Please If ya have any 
experience or ideas write me.

ADDITIONAL INFO

The oil level is not too high so no real volume of gas is in the oil. I have 
no major oil leaks.

My real question is can I get better mileage from this setup (carb and 
exhaust)HOW?????? I realize that the carb is the going to be the general 
answer to my problem but we really did do a good job on the adjustments.
