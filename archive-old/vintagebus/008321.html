&gt;So what I am wondering is if anyone knows 
&gt;where to get a fuel pump rebuild kit that would have the gasket I need, or 
&gt;has any suggestions on making a gasket, or any hints to a quick quality fix.
&gt;Thanks

Making gaskets is a very easy thing to do. The trick will be to get the right thickness/type of material. If there is a section that has not been crushed out you can measure the thickness of the original. If it's fiber check shirt cardboard or a manila folder. I try to stay away from colored and coated stuff. Good luck.
