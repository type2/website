Subject: Re: [VB] New Double Cab/Tow Truck Horror Story

Hey -
Bummer about the DC! 
I am not a member of AAA, but I know in my neck of the Northern California 
woods AAA contracts with local tow companies. These locals have to jump 
through many hoops to get this contract with AAA. You might try going to the 
manager or owner of the AAA approved tow company that did this to your DC to 
work out a reasonable &quot;settlement&quot; before taking it to AAA as a formal 
complaint. If faulty equipment or incompetent operators are thing indicative 
of this local tow company, then AAA may not want to continue to associate 
with this local company anymore.
Good luck!
