Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Sightings

Just to let everybody know, I was at Chick-fil-A today, and they do still
have these tapes.  I was able to get one of them.  Now I need to go back and
get the rest of them.

&gt; If you go to your local Chick-fil-A, they have a set of 4 cassette tapes
to
&gt; go with the kids meal, and if I remember, two of them have a bus on the
&gt; cover.  I tried to get one last time I was there, but they were all out.
&gt; Don't know if they still have them, that was probably 2 weeks ago.  I'll
&gt; have to go back soon and check.
