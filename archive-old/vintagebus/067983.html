Subject: Front end Q's (part deux)

Well, I spent another weekend under the bus! I took out the old spindles on Friday along with the steering rods and found some interesting &quot;engineering&quot; in the process.  The lower link pin on the passenger side was frozen in the spindle!  (that could explain why one tire wears faster than the others!) The lower link on the drivers side had NO bearing in it, unless you count the shattered shims that were sliding around in there! I should have checked those sooner. Well after spending a good amount of time scraping the torsion arms clean and painting it looks good in there finally! There was so much crud on the torsion arms It looked like I had &quot;heavy duty&quot; arms! 

I will be moving on to the center pin in the next few days and was wondering if there are any tricks to getting it off, other than soaking it with penetrating oil. Of course mine is rusted on, it didn't even have a bolt in it to hold it on to the other rod!
