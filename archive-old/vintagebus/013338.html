&gt; George, All,
&gt; The volcanic dust wind tunnel report I gave gives us all material to
&gt; interpret.  George says that since the dust stuck that the air was
&gt; moving slower along the sides of the scooped '67.  This allowed the
dust
&gt; to adhere.  Earlier George wrote that turbulence along the sides of
the
&gt; bus would limit the amount of smooth flowing air to enter the scoops. 

The turbulent air would be moving slower (relative to the bus) than
the laminer-flow air a bit further from the bus.  The turbulence
reduces the amount of fast-moving air that is the source of positive
pressure (stagnation pressure) in the scoop.

&gt; Wow! The dust was very fine and most of it actually just fell off over
&gt; the still night.  Closing the side doors most of the dust fell off of
&gt; that side.  I think that turbulence would have knocked off any fine
dust
&gt; as it was being deposited.  
&gt; There may be another explaination.  The Elk!  The male elk were in rut
&gt; at the time.  At night you could hear them roaring from various
parts of
&gt; the valley and mountain.  It was a still night and the sound was
really
&gt; travelling.  Perhaps the dust stuck to the sides of the bus because of
&gt; some special sort of elk psychosexual-mechanical glue.  Maybe we can
get
&gt; George to mount some of his sensors on the bull elk to measure this
&gt; phenomenon.  Maybe listees have some ideas of possible placement
&gt; locations!  Gary Gibson  Tucson

I'll be happy to supply the sensors, but _you'll_ be the one to insert
them and attach the data interface to the test subject. :)
