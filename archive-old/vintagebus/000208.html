Subject: [VB] Where can I buy the large &quot;garages&quot; that were at Costco?
Message-ID: &lt;0.4eb2db49.2555e6ed_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Just went to Costco to buy one of those large car shelters - garages they had 
in the summer, the ones that are big enough to drive a car in.

they said they were summer only , and were sent back to make room for the 
Christmas stuff........
these were the ones that cost about $170
same story from K-Mart

Any ideas who stocks them as a normal item ?

if it matters I am in Los Angeles..........and yes it does rain , in fact 
they are talking it might rain early next week ...........

Any help appreciated.......
