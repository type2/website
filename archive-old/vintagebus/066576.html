Subject: Bus Depot Snow Closing Today

Just a note to say that the Bus Depot will be closing shortly today due to a
severe snow storm.

We are making every effort to process all existing Expedited (air) orders
before we leave (or get snowed in!), and UPS has told us that they'll come
pick them up today despite the severe weather.  However, any Expedited
orders placed online after noon today (eastern time) will not be processed
until tomorrow, and we'll probably shut down the phones at 1:00.   We will
reopen at 11 tomorrow morning as usual.  (Phone lines are likely to be busy
for the first hour or so due to the closing today.)

Our aplogies for any inconvenience.
