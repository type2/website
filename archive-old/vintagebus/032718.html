Well list I wanted to write letter to thank all the people that responded to
my email regarding the need for a roof rack. I recently posted a message to
the list asking if anyone had a rack that they would be willing to
loan/rent/sell me for an upcoming vacation that I am going on next week. Not
only was I offered great advice on getting/making a cheap rack, places that
rent generic racks, and a few others willing to offer me one for sale, but I
was also offered one to use as a loan. This was from someone that I had
never met before or had previous contact with.   I find this generosity
amazing and well worth noting. I personally do not have a problem loaning
tools, equipment to people I know, but would I be willing to loan someone a
$300.00 rack to trek off to another state without knowing them or knowing
someone that could vouch for them? I hate to say it but probably not. The
person that loaned it to me, is a true bus nut and has been into them for
years. He  has a wife and kids and lives a modest lifestyle in Ballard. I
could just tell that loaning me this rack is the kind of thing he does,
someone that trusts in his fellow neighbor. It is uplifting to see this type
of generosity is still alive. 
 
Thanks
