That's an interesting concept.  It's possible it was one of my distant German
cousins who has &quot;the gift&quot;.  Not my Double Cab though, it's a non-listee

 That's the M-code for Everetts bus. VW knew many years ago that this bus
 would belong to Everett of VW Planet and threw in that M-code knowing it
 would screw everyone up in the new? 21 century or is it still the 20th?

 Yes, 753, I didn't even think they went that high...  This is on a '62
DC.
 
 Anybody else even have that?
