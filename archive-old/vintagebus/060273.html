Subject: POR15 and window frames

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I am intending on restoring my door window frames and my pop out window =
frames in the next couple of months.  These are the only parts of my my =
bus that have aged badly since its restoration in 93/94.
If I blast the frames, and then use POR-15 in one of the methods listed =
in the last couple of days, should my frames last a lot longer before =
rusting?
And whilst on the question of front door window frames, currently the =
rubbers fitted are in good condition, however the quarter lights do not =
seal against the rubber, it seems to be too fat at the bottom, causing a =
2-3mm gap all the way down the rear most side.  Is this how it should =
be?  If not any recommendations for a make of rubbers for my 66 bus?  I =
am in the UK, but most of the manufacturers are sourcable from within =
the UK, if not I may be able to pick them up next month when my work =
takes me to Indiana for a month.

Thanks
Paul
