Subject: tri-cities (wa) vs. palo alto (calif)

since there isn't a whole lot of bus information in this posting i'm sending it on a friday.  a couple of weeks ago i'd inquired about the presence of bus folks in the tri-cities area of washington state.  i'd had a very generous job offer up in there and was trying to make up my mind.  i also had a somewhat less generous job offer that was nearer &quot;home.&quot;  i've made the decision and will start mid-october at the second job.

the factor that had the largest impact was what my friendly local auto repair shop allows me to do on their premises.  sexy sounding, huh?  well, it is!  all for a day spent at the shop getting dirty and lending a hand when needed, i can use fine equipment and tools, i have access to a lift and the most excellent mind of the shop owner!  in the end that become too valuable to give up.

oh yeah, and the bright spot of light i'd get on my resume by working at the second job also factored in.  after i put in my time there i'll be able to go anywhere!  i figure in three years time my truck and my cabrio will be ready for the road in a serious way.  by that time the shop owner will probably be retired anyway and maybe, just maybe i'll be ready to fly solo with my vw maintenance.

In a new car, you're just going somewhere;                                
in a Volkswagen you ARE somewhere. -Stormy Henderson's Dad
