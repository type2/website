&gt;         I'm considering holding an event on a Mississippi River levy (this
&gt; levy will not be dry) in the sleepy little town of LeClaire, Iowa (corner of
&gt; Mississippi River and I-80). Can probably get a great deal on motel rooms
&gt; and it's a terrific location.
&gt;
&gt;         Are there enough Midwest listees to make this a success?
&gt;
&gt;         If it sounds do-able to you please respond.
&gt;
&gt;         If you have any advice about staging such an event, let me know.

  hey bill i am a member of a s.wisc. and n.illinois bus club named Der
Busbesitzer Gruppe(the bus owners group).
if you somehow include camping there is a good chance a bunch of us could show
up.that is if it doesn't conflict with some of our favorite events! if you want
to see a list of midwest events go to our website.

ps. the young lady who sets up our site loves buses but not necessarily the
years and models and such.
good luck!
