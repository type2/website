Anything with &quot;isocyinates&quot; is dangerous.  If you are using anything with
&quot;isos&quot; especially in an enclosed environment you need to use a positive
pressure breathing system.  On the other hand, I have used PPG DP products for
quite some time with only a canister mask.  The key for me is that this is in
a outside environment.
I've only sprayed small parts, so the volume of mist in the air is low and I
stay up wind of the over spray.

You need to decide how much your future health is worth?  Are your lungs worth
$200 dollars or so.  I am going to build my own out of a small raft inflator
air pump and scrap vinyl tubing.  I'll purchase a over the counter hood.

Isocyinates are odorless and tasteless, so you'll never no you are breathing
them till it is too late.

Good luck.

&gt; &gt; welding with a 1/2&quot; overlap then with two butted edges.  I primed the
&gt; &gt; bus with PPG DP-40
&gt; &gt; epoxy primer which is an excellent way to go if you live in the
&gt; &gt; rustbelt.  It's a bit more expensive, but you'll only do this once and
&gt; &gt; the cost of materials
&gt; all,
&gt;
&gt; i have read that using epoxy primer is dangerous on teh lungs without a
&gt; positive pressure respirator as a chemical canister type will only filter
&gt; out the really dangerous stuff for a little while and you will then start
&gt; inhaling dangerous stuff that doesnt even have a taste or smell... thus i
&gt; have avoided using this product at home.
&gt;
&gt; anyone have any suggestions/experiences/words of wisdom?
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
