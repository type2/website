 Probably not interesting to most of you but I'm a big proponent of passing 
on VW information so here's a photo of mine:

 Note the aluminum reservoir with the ATE-logo'd screw top.
 
 So if you see one at your local swaps, think about picking it up if the 
price is right.

The aluminium reservoirs have a problem with corrosion, so before buying one 
at a swap, look to see if it has any holes in the bottom.  Think they were 
used a bit later, that I have found them on later 50s buses, but not sure off 
the top of my head.

also , the bd master cylinders are a smaller ID than the 55-66 one, think its 
19mm intead of 21mm. though I did drive around with a 55-66 MC on my 53 for a 
while, until I found a goo 19mm/bd one, which made the pedal feel better 
actually.
