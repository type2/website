In a message dated 4/23/00 6:53:34 PM Pacific Daylight Time, 
cwe_at_dana.ucc.nau_dot_edu P-mailed us:
&lt;&lt; I have a stock 1600 built up on a new case (done by me) and rebuild heads
 (done by local shop I trust) and I've accumulated ~1500miles thus far.  The 
heads are single port and the carb I'm using is a 30 PICT 1.  I have rebuilt 
it and all the jets are stock as per Bentley specs.  My dizzy is a combo 
vac/centrifugal advance model actual for a 74 Bug but it's in great shape and 
other sources on the type2 page show it to be compatible.  Other info:  I'm 
at 7000 ft and am running at about 10 deg, similar to lots of folks up here.  
So, to my problem, then:  basically, I'm running rich as indicated by smell 
and slight black smoke on acceleration. The plugs are a bit darker than I'd 
like).  No backfiring or hesistation, but some flat spots in rpm range.  
Power is pretty much in the range of other well tuned buses I've driven.  The 
other main problem is a 'chugging' sort of deal that appears well running mid 
RPM
 range and under little or no load.  So, should I start tinkering with the 
main jet? (it's already small at 116) or the air correction jet?  I have a 
fair amount of spare carb stuff.  What about the chugging?  I have a new fuel 
pump and good compression all the way around...and my ignition system is 
perfect as far as I can tell.  Also, no manifold leaks (I sprayed some 
starting fluid around in there) and heat risers, preheat intake etc all 
functioning.  I cc'ed the accelerator pump and checked washer thickness in 
float valve.  The carb seems to be in great shape with no 
leaking/stinking/sticking etc.   Sorry I made this so long, but it's hard to 
get good advice around here and I figured I'd give you all the pertinent 
info.  Thank you very
 much in advance for any help, however small or speculative (or referral).
  Thanks again,     Colin Edgar &gt;&gt;
Hi Colin,
1.  Are you using a stock aircleaner and muffler?
2.  Are you getting any fuel seep or leaks from the carb at either/both the 
throttle shaft ends from when you shut off the engine to five or ten minutes 
later?
3.  What is the ID number of your distributor?  Have you been timing it with 
a static light?  If so did you check the distributor advance the first time 
with a strobe timing light and a tach to make sure that it reaches at least 
20BTDC _at_ 2,500RPM?
4.  Are you using a stock lower pulley?  If so have you blueprinted it to 
make sure where the timing marks really are and put a 180 degree mark on it 
to do 2&amp;4 valves correctly?
5.  If yes to everything above except #2, where are the flat spots you are 
encountering?  Especially at about what RPMs?
