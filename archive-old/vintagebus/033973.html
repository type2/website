I'm trying to sort out a mess of wiring under the dash and noticed this 
little box with many wires protruding from it which looks very corroded. 
What is this thing called so I can replace it and why don't I see it on 
any of the wiring diagrams I have been able to find? The bus has been 
converted to 12V, was this added then?

you have a 66  (?)  - you should have a nine pin (nine wires) box that does
bulinkers/high beams, etc.    Look at a wiring diagram for a 66 / 67 bus- it
should be there.  New ones aren't cheap, btw , so If it aint broken don't fix
it, consider installing kick panels and you wont see it anymore.
