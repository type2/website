To the minutia kingpins:

Firstly, at no point was I referring to &quot;Jims&quot; panel conversion.  I was
eluding to the person who posted a URL with pics of a bus with crank out
windows.  The person in question never said the bus was a panel....let
alone a walk-through.  There were not even any pictures of the cab or
interior...only pics of the drivers side exterior showing the crank out
windows.

As the membership has so thoroughly pointed out my error regarding the
no vent  option for a walk-through panel, I stand  completely
corrected.  I bow to the great triviality of the list.  Long live the
list!  BTW thanks for all the condescending mail re: my post.  Its good
to see the M-code Nazis are not asleep at their posts :-}

Steve
