Subject: Re: [VB] That ballsy rattle!

I agree! If nothing else appears to be the problem, and it points to an
overhaul, then I can tear down the engine to the sealed block without
cylinders, and check the feel and spacing of the rods directly. If there
is an out of spec rod bearing, or a worn rod, it should be apparent at
that point. If I can wiggle a rod, it's bad. Also would be able to check
the wrist pin tolerances too, on the way. Plus the rings, etc.

&gt; after that, it is time to autopsy the engine.  We know that doing a autopsy is
&gt; not what you are looking forward to doing, but if you do it instead of waiting
