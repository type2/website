There is no magic to keeping black plates on a car that already has them;
you just can't put them back onto a vehicle that's been &quot;upgraded&quot; to
later plates. I'm sure they love to collect the old plates from people,
as it measn they can now sell that # to someone for a boutique plate.

As an aside, I wonder how much of the $$$ for an &quot;environmental plate,&quot;
as they're called, actually goes to the environment.  You know, like
the California Lottery and schools.

&gt; I have black and gold plates on my 65 and have never had any hassle from
&gt; DMV.  I just pay the thing by mail, no face to face interaction, that's
&gt; the key.  BTW only $34 last year woohoo!!
