&gt;Now does anyone have the specs for cutting the

&gt;you out there???

Kelly Brown (aka) metwiz2_at_aol_dot_com has both the specs and a tracing of the 
hole.  He just put an nos corner on my 58 deluxe and the hole is perfect in 
both size and location.  He must be busy these days, or he would have spoken 
up for sure. E-mail him directly and I am sure he will tell you.  Also ask 
him to post the measurements to the list.  Also, hole size and location is 
correct for at least 55 - early 59 buses (I am unsure of barndoor placement). 
 The earlier taillights do not need the extra holes for the screws.
