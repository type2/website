&lt;&lt; I was surprised to not see much on the use of the Kymco Torquemeister on 
 removing big tranny nuts in the archive.  Has no one done this? &gt;&gt;

Hi Tom,
Not us.  Nice tool, but too specialized.  It will not do all too many needed 
tasks like the inner RGB nut on 1964-67 buses.  A pair of nice torque 
wrenches (One 1/2&quot; drive low foot pound range and the other for higher up 
into the 250 Ft. Lbs. range 3/4&quot; drive sockets.), a 3/4&quot; drive Proto breaker 
bar (Craftsman 3/4&quot; breaker bar bends and breaks too easily!), and a four 
foot cheater bar have been fine for us.            Eric&amp;Barb
