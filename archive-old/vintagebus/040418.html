Subject: RE: [VB] bad manners

&gt; But I am becoming increasingly alarmed at the misplaced
&gt; hatred and even outright racism that is swelling as a result of the
&gt; attacks, both on this list and elsewhere.

&gt; Was this directed at me??


No, Les, it really wasn't directed at you specifically. It was a general
statement about the tone as a whole that I've been seeing not only on the VW
lists but also on pretty much all of the various lists and newsgroups I
subscribe to.   I just thought it needed to be said.
