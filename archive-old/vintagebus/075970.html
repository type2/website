&gt; I have been able to purchase 3, 15 &quot; bus rims. I was planning on putting 
&gt; two one the back and keeping the currrent 15&quot; bug rims on the front, until I 
&gt; can locate the last one. Any problem doing that? I was going to keep one 15&quot; 
&gt; bug rim for a spare. Lastly a local tire guy recommended using 15  X  75 X 
&gt; 205's onthe bus rims
&gt; comments please

Hi Tom,
The bug rims/tires will work for the short term, but get some more bus rims 
and rated tires ASAP to replace those.  205/75R15s are a good tire and will 
work well if they have a wieght load rating of at least 1525 Lbs..  You might 
want to check out the Cooper 195/82R15s that are alot higher rated load rating 
and 6 ply.  Plus these tires are a tad narrower and taller so they will fit into 
the rear pre-1962-1/2 lower and tighter rear wheel wells easier and give you 
a bit higher top MPH than the 205s.
