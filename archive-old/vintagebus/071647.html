Subject: yakima show-goers...

Fellow bussers,

Mybrother is bringing some t-shirts that are of the &quot;transporter&quot;  nad
&quot;beetle&quot; type to the Yakima show, be sure to stop by the groundzero espresso
bus and check them out!  Also for you coffee freaks, check out my groundzero
world coffee tour shirts. I don't have any photos of these shirts to post yet,
but I will when I get back from the show. Hope to see many of you there!

-Tom Purdum
