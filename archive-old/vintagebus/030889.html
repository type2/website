I was over at a VW guy's house yesterday and he had a bunch of cargo mats
all laid out on his front walkway (damn showoff).  We noticed all of them
were slightly different and the question came up, is there a way to date
a cargo mat based on it's markings or style?  All of the mats in question
were black, in this case.

Interested,
