Subject: Stripping tranny drain plugs
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Greetings all,

    Just towed my 67 Deluxe from its storage spot for the last 2 years, and I 
am playing hooky from work today to try to get it roadworthy. Trying to 
change my transaxle fluid, but the drain plugs in the center section are 
stripping out. I have tried using both the socket style and mongo allen 17 mm 
wrenches. The plugs have a &quot;button&quot; in the center, and it seems that it is 
preventing the wrench from going all the way in (my fill plug is flat inside 
and came out no sweat). Is there a hollow wrench that is made to fit these, 
or am I just relegated to liquid wrench and hammer approach?

Thanks,
Garrett
