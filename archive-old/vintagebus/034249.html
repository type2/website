OK,

Back to this thread...

I found a very interesting archive message:

   http://vw.i405_dot_com/sm.asp?path=\vintagebus_at_type2\Y1999\February\202

That quotes some figures from the Bentley  (1963-1967) that says 65MPH at
4040 RPM.  This exactly matches my 65MPH at 4000RPM measurements :)

Now, can anyone explain why the same archive message says a 1961 does 65MPH
at 3620RPM?  HUH, don't the 1.39 redux boxes make the RPM higher, not
lower?!

I don't have my own Bentley with me now to verify the numbers in the Feb 2
1999 message...
