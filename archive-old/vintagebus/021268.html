Hey all, I happened across a 62walk thru standard a couple days ago at a
salvage yard. Well today I went back to pick up a few goodies. Some I
needed some I didn't but what the heck. This bus has no motor or middle
seat and the floor is RUSTED. But the body all in all looks pretty darn
OK. The nose and corner panels are in good shape, no big dents or
massive rust(swiss cheese). I didn't know if anyone was in need of some
decnt body parts or not. I snagged a few goodies but there is a few
left. I'm in eastern Iowa so if you want more info just holler! I hate
the thought f it just rusting away to nothing if it can give life to
another. Hope this helps someone out.      Shawn
