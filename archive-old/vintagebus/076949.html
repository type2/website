Subject: Re: [VB] Sears and flywheels

yummy tools cost more.   I have some Snap-On and Matco stuff, and it is 
really nice.   I spent a lot on a little stubby snap-on ratchct, but you know 
what.... it is really nice.   every time I use it I admire it.  The sound it makes 
is good too.   No regrets.   Miles different than the craftsman. And the long 
10mm socket lives on it, for all those little nuts.  
 But it would be impossible for me to go out and buy everything snap on.   
ouch in the wallet.  And the 21 / 17 allen wrench is nice.   and the S wrench 
that is 13mm one end and 14mm the other is good for the hard to get to carb nut. 
  I got a lot of tools at pawn shops.

Better carry a ~big~ wallet.

It's good stuff, but a Mac or Snap-On wrench is really not much better than 
a Craftsman, unless you use it all day, every day.  It's been twenty years 
since I bought my last tool off the truck, so I don't know where they're 
being made any more...
