Subject: Live Radio Broadcast from Bus Depot on Friday!

Philadelphia rock radio station WMMR (93.3 FM) will be broadcasting LIVE
from the Bus Depot this Friday (the 18th) from 1 to 2 pm!

The station contacted me and asked if they could do it. Turns out that just
before Christmas, the station held a big 20th-anniversary party for on-air
personality Pierre Robert. Big shindig- ex mayor Ed Rendell was there, lots
of bands, etc. etc.  He had driven a '72 Westy cross-country years earlier,
and as part of the festivities the station manager gave him an identical bus
as a gift.  They now want him to come to the shop with his bus and talk on
the air about busses during their Friday &quot;workforce block.&quot;  Apparantly they
will play 6-7 songs during the hour and the rest of the time will be talk.

Of course everyone at the shop is excited to have their &quot;15 minutes of
fame.&quot;  We'll be closing the phones from 1 to 2, so don't bother calling.
But if you happen to be a local customer, and would like to meet Pierre
Robert, it might be a good time to come pick up your order. :-)
