Subject: Re: [VB] And the saga begins

----- Original Message -----

&gt;   I also have a 1960 SC that I am ready to finish, (after I get over the
&gt; sticker shock of the DC), that is going BONE ASS STOCK (the SC) except can
I
&gt; still call it restored being I did replace the BASTERD 40 hp with a newer
&gt; model 40 hp engine but still retained the original basterd fuel pump, tin,
&gt; dizzy etc?
&gt;
&gt;   So for the VN's this bus could not be called restored being I do not
have
&gt; the original engine, but it's far from being a custom!!!!
&gt;
&gt; ronnie  to each there own
&gt;

That's what I'm trying to say. In the automotive world, &quot;restoration&quot; does
not mean just one thing.

LOL, 'restore' the old inch pincher single cab, by shortening it back up,
putting an OG engine back in, etc, etc.....
