All I know is that it will take place on October 8th in Normal, Illinois and
yes, it's like right next to Bloomingdale. It's about two hours drive from
Chicago going south. It's gonna be on Fort Jesse Rd. Show, swap meet etc.
There is a pre-BugFest campout at Yogi Bear Jellystone Park in Goodfield, IL
on Saturday with bonfire. They say Fest will be from 12:00 to 4:00 PM but
who knows? It's CILVA Fest so you know it's sponsored by Central Illinois
Volkswagen Association. Local DBG members going too. Check our site for more
info. http://www.dreamwater_dot_com/dbg/

I won't be driving my bus there but I'll be in my F*ord E*plorer just in
case I'll need to haul some parts back. Anyone from the area going? Want to
come along? I'm only going with my son.
