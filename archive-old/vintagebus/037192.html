 I am thoroughly confused about the year of my bus!  I had sent a message
 to the list ealier saying that the VIN of my bus was 282407, but after I
 looked at the actual title I noticed that it said 200632.  So I decided to
 investigate.
 
 I went out to the bus and lifted the front seat and looked behind the
 passenger side to see the number 282407 stamped into the metal.  Next I
 went back to the engine compartment and looked at the front of the
 compartment at the VIN plate and noticed it had 200632 stamped on it and
 right beneath it on the frame (body).

wow- BIG difference in numbers here

VIN 200 632 was buildt Aug of 56
VIN 282 407 was bilt sept 57

the number behind the pass seat is the body number.  Usually the VIN and body 
numbers are much closer together than that. wierd.   are you sure you have 
the numbers right?  perhaps the metal divider was replaced, does it look like 
it?  in any case, the number stamped behind the seat is NOT the VIN.

the number in the engine compartment should be the VIN.  which is actually on 
your title.  excellent.

As an early 57, it came with the plastic bubble taillights, reflectors, and a 
brake light deck lid



btw, this bus would not have come with a M code plate behind the seat, just 
the body number stamped in, the m code plate was introduced around VIN 
398000.  However, I had a 59 w/o m code plate- it had the body number stamped 
in, about 50,000 after the m code plate was introduced.  Odd.  The Body 
number was only maybe a hundred or so different than the VIN.  NOT 80K 
different.

The plate on the side of the over head vent was not intoduced till after 
that, yes  the earlier buses have the plate in the engine compartment.

to get your mcodes you have to write to the factory.  but they are usually 
fairly obvious from looking at the bus.  So unless you need your original 
engine number why bother.
