&gt; &gt;Dawn and Todd are not likely to appear on the list(s) again. I know *I'd*
&gt; &gt;be too embarassed to. Having been a small business owner, I know the pain
&gt; &gt;they're feeling. It's not an excuse for doing people wrong, but Steve
&gt; &gt;Lashley is right that they're probably worse off than the people left
with
&gt; &gt;less money and no parts. Again, no excuse.
&gt;

You all need to quit it. The poor dear probably got Tetanus from touching
one of them buses at her new AZ digs, more than likely the SO-34. Probably
undergoing a painful battery of shots as we all sit around and plug her
reputation full of more holes than that $3500 23 window someone posted
about.

I'm sure one to say sh*t when I have a mouthfull, but if anyone was
expecting that buying a repop canvas from a woman that makes them out of her
house, who just moved a couple thousand miles to an entirely new climate,
was going to be like whipping out the VISA at WalMart.....
