&lt;&lt;  on. all was good until parts of the tool started bending. It eventually 
came loose from not being strong enough at the shaft that goes into the oil 
channels on the sides of the pump. I am happy that my welds held just fine. 
Oh well.&gt;&gt;
Hi Rex,
Did you loosen the case bolts in the oil pump area?  Can you weld on thicker 
rod on the head of the bolt?
 
 I think tommarrow I'll give Tom's idea a shot. I had thought about doing 
that and probably should have went ahead with it instead of wasting time 
making a tool that I can probably buy for less than $10.&gt;&gt;
$10.00?  Not the good one!  Plus as we said this one tool will not work for 
all the oil pumps out there.

&lt;&lt;  I'm just having fun tearing the engine apart and it's the weekend...you 
know?&gt;&gt;
If you are just ripping an entire engine apart you can just unbolt the pump 
and wait till you unbolt and loosen the case halfs from each other.  Then you 
can remove the pump with just you finger tips!   Eric&amp;Barb.
