&lt;&lt; I was at a stop light this afternoon on the way to my daughter's swim meet 
when
 disaster struck.  I put the DC in gear and the linkage came loose.  Figuring 
that
 it had popped out, I got the truck pushed over to the side, rolled out my
 &quot;emergency repair mat&quot;, slid under the DC and found that the rear shift 
coupler
 had exploded into two pieces.  Everything was still there, but wire would 
not hold
 it together to allow shifting.  I cut the wire off and aligned everything and
 tried to figure out what I could do to make it operational.  I hit on the 
idea of
 using some of the zip ties in the tool box.  One that went between the two 
set
 bolts to hold everything together and then a half dozed wrapped around the
 circumference of the coupler to hold the first one in place.  Ended up 
working
 like a charm and I made it to the swim meet ON TIME and back without further
 incident.
 
 On the way to the meet, I was a little apprehensive about the quality of the
 quickie repair, so I left it in third all the way.  Light DC + the 2L type 
IV =
 amazing lugging power when needed.  On the way back, I gingerly went through 
the
 gears like normal and it worked fine.
 
 Question:  The coupler that was down there was red urethane.  Why aren't 
they made
 out of metal?  Does that much vibration get absorbed by the non-metal 
couplers?
 
 Looks like I'll be out coupler shopping in the morning.
