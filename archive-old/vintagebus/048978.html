Subject: Repop Pop-Out Frames Arrived

My pair arrived this afternoon.  These are the Wolfgang Intl. frames, purchased through Vintage Parts in Burbank, CA.

Well,.... I think I'm going to send mine back.  They are well made, nicely done, good quality and close to original.  My only complaint is the way in which the two halves join.  They seem to be slightly off in terms of the top line, where the frame to body seal runs.  In all four cases (two joints per frame) one half was always higher than the other.  Mind you this is slight. I want to make it clear I'm being very picky.  (Unfortunately, it's what I like to do.)  Also on the sides of the frame where the halves meet, both pieces seem to have a *twisting* position where they join.  Again only slight but IMHO will be enhanced once some glossy paint is applied.  Original frames, no matter how rusty, always seem to line up perfectly.  There just made to fit, correctly.

So, all in all a nice repop frame.  I'm sure with a little effort one could get the halves to seat properly. (But if I'm going to put effort into frames, I'm going to do it on original equip.) Perfect for the daily driver who's owner doesn't spaz if his bus isn't flawless.  But if you have the anal hee-bee-jee-bee's, you might want to stick with original stuff.  Once again, nobody can do it like Volkswagen DID.
