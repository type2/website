Hi Susan,
We have the Harp style of mirrors in our collection of spare parts.  We did 
talk to someone last year and they had rebuilt the same style mirrors by 
buying the rubber trim for the aftermarket EE mirrors _at_:
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/_securefolder/wwshowpn.asp?PN=211857515&quot;&gt;http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/_securefolder/wwshowpn.asp?PN=211857515&lt;/A&gt;

The fellow had to cut and glue the trim smaller, but it worked for him.  
Perhaps this rubber trim would work for your purpose?
