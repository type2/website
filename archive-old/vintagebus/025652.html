&gt; &gt; &gt; Just noticed my chassis number is 216.000.001.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Am I to infer that this is the first one built for the 1966 model year??
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is registered as a 1965.

&gt; &gt; Wow. What does the m-code tag say about production date...August 1, 1965
&gt; &gt; by any chance?

&gt; As a matter of fact, yes it does. Did it once belong to you??

 And jack again:

Why yes, it is my long lost bus gertrude, who was stolen from me 15
years ago! Please return her as soon as possible. I'll send out the $100
reward post haste.


Actually, it makes sense that it was made on august 1 if it is actually
the first 66 bus. VW changed model year on august 1.  I would say it is
indeed the first 1966 bus.  Congrats. Cool factor jumps way up on this
one. I have the 170,320th bus made in 1965, not nearly as cool as the
first in 1966.
