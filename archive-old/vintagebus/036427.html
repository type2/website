 Hi , A few questions. I searched the Archive, but couldn't quite get the
 info that I wanted...
 Is the crank apron on my 2/59 correct? (it sure looks like it)
.............
according to the books, they dropped the crank start at the end of the 58 
model year, but I doubt it.   I had a may 59 bus with a crank apron that 
loked original ( same shade SRW on one side, same shade aqua on the other) A 
number of other listees have or had 59s with what looked like a factory crank 
apron.  I have even seen a crank apron for a bus with the factiry tailpipe 
cutout (meaning post 36hp) it was on a bastard 40hp era 60 SC - That may have 
been an option?
========
 Should a 65' apron work?
.........
ya-
 its is the same where it fits on and where the latch goes. sometimes they 
get a bit bent and are hard to deal with. or the engine lid is bent.  If the 
latch area is completely different, you may have the 66/67  push button style 
decklid/apron on your 65 
..........
 If so, it doesn't. I can't seem to latch the engine lid. Can I shim it from
 behind or something?
 Is the cut-away for the tailpipe the same shape on the two aprons?
     In case anyone is wondering, I want to use my spare 65' until  I can get
 my 59' welded. Someone welded the ident on the left, and made a new one on
 the right! &gt;&gt;
--------
a crank hole 36hp apron shouldn't have had any cut outs.  The 65 one should 
have one.
