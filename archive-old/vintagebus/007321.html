&gt; 
&gt; But, will only run for about 30-45 seconds at full throttle/speed...then
&gt; is basically is starving for gas (I assume).  I've changed the fuel
&gt; filter (plenty of gas in it...at least at idle) and futzed around with
&gt; the carb adjustment.  Timing and wires are all spot on and tight.  The
&gt; carb was just rebuilt about 6 months ago and has been running great till
&gt; recently...clog??
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas??  I'd like to drive on the freeway again.
&gt; 

Perhaps crud clogging the screen inside the fuel tank?
