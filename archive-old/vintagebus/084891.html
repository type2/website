Subject: BBB from LA - via 29palms and 62 to Parker

George
what's oh-dark-thirty? - sounds zombie time to me :-)

Would love to caravan with some others.

I plan(ned!) to leave central LA tomorrow, Thurs, around 9am, and go 
east  to 29 Palms, then follow rte 62 to Parker. This looked the 
best/quietest route to me from LA, avoiding I-15 and I-40.

NOW I HEAR Parker is a mess of construction!  Anyone have more info?

Sadly it seems everyone is going the I-40 route. I dont like to start 
in the dark either. Anyone available to caravan on my choice? Any 
real info on Parker?

Can I go up the CA side from Parker to the dam and cross the dam?

Olive and John,
71 white westy.
