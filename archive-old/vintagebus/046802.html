Hi Andy,
The problem with automatic idle shut off valves is that they will mask a carb 
that is running too rich while at idle.  If a car runs on after turning off 
the key it needs correct sized carb jetting and/or adjustments.  These valves 
to us are another non-improvement, like electric choke or automatic tranny.
