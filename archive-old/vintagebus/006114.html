Subject: Re: [VB] Carb woes / flat spot and over heating continued. MORE

Thanks for all the input!

Things did not go as expected. :-(

I had the engine out in 30 minutes. Man we were doing great!

Then started checking the thing out.  We found more stuff wrong / worn/ out
of spec on this engine that I am surprised it went uphill at all. I should
have done a compression check before I put this engine in. I had compression
leaks everywhere. Cylinders scored, bad valves, etc..

I made a call to an esteemed engine building listee (unnamed unless he wants
to chime in) do get his advice on the new mexi engines. He suggested I not
go that direction for a bus and the waiting list was 2 months for one of
his.

So.. I tore the whole thing down and took the cam, crank and case to the
machine shop for align bore and new bearings.

I'll never get this thing back together, but if I do, I will learn a lot in
the process!  My plan is to build a new single port engine as I have a SP
intake manifold available and new heads are only a few bucks more than DP.
More torque that way??? This will be a Frankenstein! SP doghouse engine
built on a Mexican universal case!

Think of me at Oktoberbus!

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Beast: 69 camper
&gt;
&gt; Symptom: dreadfully bad flat spot at low rpm. I thought was due to 009 but
&gt; as bad if not worse with vac advance dizzy. Rebuilt carb made it worse yet
&gt; and today at idle, parked, when I stomp the gas is the thing nearly dies.
I
&gt; have to pump the petal to keep it running. Is fine at higher rpm. Ran
great
&gt; in this 60 degree weather going down hill!  :-(
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas?
&gt;
&gt; Tomorrows job: new cooler, all new intake gaskets, install stock exhaust,
&gt; torque heads, and try to figure what is up with that carb problem. Wish me
&gt; luck!
