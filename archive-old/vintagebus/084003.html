&gt;&gt;  Hi. What about using a bus exhaust or bug exhaust on a type 3 motor? I 
have a  61 bus and what kind of clutch setup would I use for the t3 motor? Can I 
use a  starter for a 67 for this motor? I am trying to convert to 12V. 
Thanks.  Craig.  &lt;&lt;



Hi Craig,
You Pmailed us the above.  Hope you do not mind we answer it on the  list.  
This way our answer can help others and other can chime in with  other details 
we may have forgotten!
  You will need to convert the type 3 engine (should be 1500  or 1600cc) to 
upright tin and use a bus muffler.  A stock 180mm  diameter clutch will work, 
but for the bus the 200mm clutch is more reliable and  robust.  The stock six 
spring clutch ( 211 141 025 D) pressure plate  or the diaphragm type we have 
used, but had problems.  The stock 200mm  nine spring clutch  (211 141 025 A, 
see part manual through vintagebus_dot_com  website) on the other hand has been bomb 
proof for us in daily driving, but  not leg straining as a lot of after 
market type super high Lbs. pressure  plates can be.  Friends of our's with their 
1776cc single carbed 1963  SO-34 Westie kept wearing out clutches frequently, 
while  never drag racing it.  Once we got them to try the nine spring 200mm 
clutch  they had no further problems.  
  Stock clutch discs are fine, but the type with the springs in the  center 
hub are a bit easier on the engine.  These springs help reduce shock  going 
into the engine from badly shifting and clutching.  If you drag race  these 
springs get thrashed....
  As for 6 or 12 volt that depends firstly on the gear ring of the  flywheel. 
 Most but not all 6 volt flywheels are of the 180mm diameter  clutch.
  In 1965 the Bus was issued with a 200mm six volt flywheel (211  105 271 C). 
 Hard to find, but worth it, BECAUSE these can be used in  6 or 12 volt 
systems.  We use these with a 6 volt starter, 12 volt  solenoid, in 12 volt 
converted buses.  The 6 volt starter on 12 volts in  the coldest weather here turns 
over and starts the engine sooo nicely.
