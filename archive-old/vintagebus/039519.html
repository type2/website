No offense intended by the term hack so plz no hackles up.  I work in 
computers, web and mainframe systems, so hack is a little different than how 
it was taken.  And let me assure you that when I hack it is with the utmost 
respect to the goal... in this case my beloved 15-window which sits 
patiently waiting under cover for my attention.  I would never do less than 
my best for it.

Again, sorry if it brought offense.  My son has worked in a machine shop for 
a number of years so I have the greatest respect for those who work the 
metal under the eyes of Hephaestus.

&gt;not above trying to make, or hack as we say in the biz, my own &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

&gt;Easy with the term hack, I been getting alot of hacks, In my biz I 
&gt;fabricate
&gt;stuff we need not hack, to me in all forms hacking is screwing up something
&gt;that should have been fixed rite the first time, and saved you time and
&gt;money probably in the long run.. just .02 worth .....
