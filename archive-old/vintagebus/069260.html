Subject: Re: [VB] blaupunkt radios

Hi Scott,
Pulled out our VOA Accessories manual printed in 1966.  It has only two pages 
with only one half page listing the Sapphire III for $55.55, the Sapphire IV 
for 106.85.  The other page and a half lists speakers and antenna.  There are 
two whole pages of Blaupunkt radio info listing 8 models and there is only 
one price listed for the AM band &quot;Vienna push button controll tuning&quot; for 
$88.45.  All prices were hand written in, but as you can see most volks would 
probably get a Sapphire IV with AM/FM instead spending the extra $33.35 above 
the Sapphire III  for only an AM Vienna Blaupunkt.
Hmmm, anyone out there with additional radio info?  Anything from price 
listed when your VW was bought, owners manuals, or even service manuals?  
Please contact us it would be interesting to put this info together.
Eric&amp;Barb
