&gt; Great findings. The Bentley for Beetles has better descriptions of a pict 
&gt; 30-3.
&gt; 1) Float was sticking on brasss rod, so rod had to be smooth in carb body 
&gt; to move. Not reliable. Replaced with tested float on polished rod. 
&gt; Freemoving.
&gt; 2) Needle valve worked, tested with air, and turned body, pushed tip to cut 
&gt; off flow. I do not think overpressure is a concern. I find that the 30 pict 
&gt; 3 requires 1.5 mm of shimming to a std .5. That should equate to three 
&gt; shims. THis needs to be measured, as I went form one shim to a shim and a 
&gt; slighly thicker fiber washer. Gonna rip out the ruler here.
&gt; 3) If there is a check vlave mechainism to prevent siphoning action in the 
&gt; Brosol non rebuildable ( a rebuildable type should be on the way) I might 
&gt; have further issues. Seems to not be the case, as an unconnected line is 
&gt; currently not moving gas.
&gt; 4) Repalced electromagnetic cut off with a 50aux jet, I think this might 
&gt; have been a bad move, putting it back, since it never ran on any way.

Hi Al,
We do not like the electromagnetic cut off due to failing in closed position. 
 Otherwise if it works they are fine.  That should be the pilot jet, might be 
a bit too small since Without &quot;Guesswork&quot; lists a 65 there.

&gt; 5) found out my fuel pressure guage reads slightly higher inverted, so my 
&gt; initial 3.6-3.8 reading was better to be estimated at correct to 3.2 
&gt; approx, which shouldn't overcome the shut off.

Would be interesting to take the fuel pump out of the loop and with a full 
gas tank run the engine.  We have done this several times when the pump died 
on us.  Just loop a section of hose from outlet to inlet of the pump to 
prevent fire and run the fuel line directly into the carb.

&gt; 6) I would say a slightly high fuel level is to blame, and the sticky float 
&gt; was a devil, vaccilating between functional and not at all, which made me 
&gt; think further shimming was keeping the needle totally off, which was 
&gt; illogical. Thanks to Bentley for Beetle, i even have this measurement now, 
&gt; for fuel level.

That should be 19.5 +/- 1

&gt; 7) I am going to go over this motor bottom up again, valves, point gap, new 
&gt; plugs, check fuel pump rod height/travel, replace with brazillian 
&gt; rebuildable, and install carb with properly shimmed needle valve, which 
&gt; will have a back up from a rebuild kit.
&gt; Now that I know the gas leaking from throttle shaft doesn't mean wasted 
&gt; bushings, I have more confidence that this is simply a fuel height issues, 
&gt; and possibly a pump allowing some fuel by when it shouldn't?  Is this 
&gt; possible

Definitely possible.

&gt; I am tunring choke to setting VERY close to off, to save gas/engines.
&gt; After this is in order, engine will get run and oil rechanged to purge 
&gt; unwanted fuels that may have escaped the last oil dump today.
&gt; I hope this has everything covered for this weekend.
&gt; I anticipate needing a 128-135 air correction, which I cannnot find, 
&gt; currently on 125 and 1966 aircleaner. Preheat hose also on the way.

Hmm, for the type 2 the &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; lists a 140z air correction jet.  
Since you are using a 66 instead of a 68 air cleaner you might need a bit 
bigger jet to lean it out to proper fuel/air mixture.
We found the float wieght, which should be 8.5 grams.
Well sounds like you have made good progress!  Keep us informed.
