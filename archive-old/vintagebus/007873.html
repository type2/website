Hi there,

Speaking of manifolds and crabs, is there such a thing as a single-port,
dual carb setup?  Would it be worth it?  I'm thinking of putting dual carbs
in my '67 (eventually), but don't want to go to dual-port with this engine
(1600 with c/w crankshaft and torque cam).  I'll build me a monster later if
need be...I just want strong reliability for now!

In the process of trying to clean out/re-organize the mess in my garage, I
came across a dual-port, single carb manifold....it was thrown in the box of
parts and junk that came with my '67.  It may or may not be used...it's hard
to tell.  It looks good.....

Anyway, I want to know if anyone wants it, what it's worth, and should I
bring it with me to KP?

Part numbers:
    Manifold cross-tubing with heat riser tubes:  113.129.701CE
    Left dual port bit:  113.129.709G
    Right dual port bit:  113.129.710G (or D?) (it's hard to read, but the
same as the right one, just for left)

Gene
