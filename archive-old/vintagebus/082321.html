Subject: Safari Windows

Hi All,

I am continuing the renovation of my 67 Westfalia, and I'll soon be pulling the windshield.  I found an ad on eBay for a set of new, aftermarket, safaris at:

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;tc=photo&amp;item=7970661952&amp;category=33686

I can't imagine there are too many manufacturers of this kind of product, does anyone know whether these are of decent quality?  I understand some don't have the reinforcing rib inside.  Who makes/sells the best one?

When you find an original set, they are in such poor condition I can't imagine the fact that they are original make them better functionally, but please correct me if I'm wrong.

And, of course, feel free to beat me up for wanting the darn things in the first place!

Thanks!!

Clark
