&gt; Here's another trick to help with solo brake bleeding.
&gt; 

Yet another, my method:

Use a clear plastic (vinyl?) tube so you can see the bubbles and the
progress of your work. I use a small plastic bottle with a nozzle top that
I cut to tightly fit the clear hose. The hose is set in place to hit the
bottom of the bottle. Fill the bottle with about an inch of fluid before
bleeding, set it upright, then bleed your brakes. You can then tighten the
valve with the hose on it, once the bubbles are visibly gone from the hose
and the bottle.

More left out details for beginners - 

The hose must fit tightly on your bleeder valve end. You start with the
valve opened a quarter turn. Oh yeah, if the hose fits really tight into
the tapered nozzle of the bottle, then drill an air-escape hole somewhere
at the top of the bottle.  A clear-ish bottle with a matching nozzle-top
can be had at any plastics supply store or arts and crafts place.

anything else?
