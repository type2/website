&lt;&lt; I was thinking that I should leave or drill a hole or three to spray said 
chemicals under high pressure into the affected area after all welding takes 
place, then sealing it up.  This goes for the places unseen that I can't get 
to...I have a feeling that I would find the evil rust devils lurking in every 
crevice...and this bus is one of the best ones I've seen!   &gt;&gt;
Hi Gene,
Not a bad idea!  We have been pondering on the same lines.  The big problem 
with areas you have not done work in to rid of as much rust as possible the 
POR-15 does not work well on thick crusty untouched rust.  So we have been 
thinking about spraying phosperic acid in these channels and tubes to rid of 
the rust and then have been trying to find out about some treatment to clean 
out the residue from the phosperic acid.  Have heard that using a body shop 
degreaser works well for this.  Then we are either going to try spraying in 
the POR-15 or high content zinc primer and paint.  Either way we will spray a 
coat of thinned down with kerosene roofing tar to protect even more.
