Subject: home built camper and test

hi  Back in 1983 I built an interior that had cabinets along the driver
side that flowed up the bump to the back. the bed was 4 feet wide. I
made a cabinet that squared off the engine bump forward. I bought a 4
foot wide by 6 feet foam mattress. 2 feet of the mattress went past the
cabinet. So I made a 2 foot by 4 foot by 1/2 ply wood bed extention
that slid under the mattress and had legs that went down at night. It
was great. make the bed then flip the 2 foot section toward the back.
Fold up the legs (ply wood) and slide under bed.  My girl friend and I
lived for 6 months like that in a 65 standard stock.  We used a cooler,
a coleman stove and lamp and went to very cold and hot places. I was 23
then. I started converting my 67 standard to almost the same except
that the bed will be full width not just 4 feet (wanna guess why?) And
this time I have a higher budget so I got an alternator and a second
battery. I had a 71 westy and thought it was great but with 2 people
you dont need a back seat and the sink unit was not very helpful . The
hanging locker on the passenger side breaks up the flow.  When I worked
in a VW shop in about 1978-80 VW had moved the cabinets all to the
driver side. That made so much more sense to me- just have the bed on
one side and the cabinets on the other. Well that is just my opinion
and experience. I have a sail boat that we stay out in, there it is
harder because you need to bring everything-like water.

I guess I should know but what are these:  SO 44, SO 69 early SO-33 etc.
where can I see them?
Frank
