&gt; What size fuse should these H4 have 25amp?

divide the wattage by 12 to get the current of the lamp.  Add the
currents of the lamps in the ciruit.  Double that to
get the fuse value, and then use the next higher standard value.

&gt; I'm running 3 additional 10 g wires from the battery in the back.  They will
&gt; be fused back there.  One wire for low beams and one for High beams

Better to use one wire for left high and low beams and one wire for
the right high and low beams, with double pole relays.  That way, a blown
fuse won't leave you completely in the dark!

, the
&gt; other will be for a set of Hella Driving lights.  I get off a 2330hrs and
&gt; drive 26 miles on a Country road with Deer.

With the tendancy of deer to run onto the road from the side, having
bright lights is really false security.  Despite having really bright
lights, the first I saw of the mule deer I hit two years ago was its head
going by about 3 feet ahead of the car.  The deer was so fast I didn't see
it even though the country was open and I was only driving 45mph!

Depending upon the size of your local deer, you might want to install a
roo bar!
