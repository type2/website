Subject: Source for L/R Turn Signal Lenses for 1965 Bus?

Hi,

Just had someone decide they needed (read:stole) the lenses (and seals)
for the front turn signals on my bus.  Any suggestions on a good place
and price for replacements?

Looking around, BFY has the pair at $90, and Wolfsburg West has them for
30/each (so $60/total).  Are these good prices, and if not, does anyone
know anyplace that can beat them?

Thanks,

Greg
