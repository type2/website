DP1600, Solex 34 PICT 3 Carb (137.5 main jet), large mouthed manifold, 009 dissy w/Pertronix, stock exhaust, timed at 10 BTDC static

Engine above in my 65.  Motor has less that 3,000 miles on it and was built with 7.5/1 compression ratio.  Seems to have little power, struggles to maintain 45 MPH up a moderate/light gradual hill.  That is actually worse than before I rebuilt it.  What is going wrong here?  Is this just the result of the compression ratio it was built with?

Any ideas?

 


Enjoy your day!
