&gt; Hi Andrew,
&gt; Interesting!  Which Bentley?  Our official VW 1960 through 1970 Without 
&gt; Guesswork for Type 1, 2 and 3 says 6 ft. lbs. for type 1 and 2.  For type 3 
&gt; it is 14 ft.lbs..

I think the type3 got the dual port in like 67 or 68... so perhaps you are
just assuming that all pre 71 type 3's are single port. Or, the manual
has an error... But that would explain it, the t3 gets 14 ft lb, cuz it
hat the DP and thus m10 fasteners.

Just a thought,

Steve
