&gt; &gt; Anyone know of a source for coloured dash light bulbs?   I have a yen for red
&gt; &gt; ones for the guages in my 61, to match the dash.  Do you think it'll work if
&gt; &gt; I paint the bulbs?

&gt; Paint might be a bit opaque, however I have colored glass with a
&gt; sharpie marker that stays put quite well. This very well might work on
&gt; a glass bulb also. worth a shot, at least.

Years ago, I bought some bulb tint from JC Whitney.  It's probably still
around.  You could also try craft stores for similar products.

Another alternative is to replace the bulbs with high-intensity red LEDs.
You'd have to put a current-limiting resistor in-line, but the LEDs would
last just about forever!
