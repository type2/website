Subject: The Joys of a Non Electronic vehicle

Well, I am certainly stupid.
I left my lights on at the airport and came back to find a dead battery.
A nice guy let me jump start my 70 westy but......
The first connection that I did was backwards with lots of sparks!
I then connected it right and she fired up right away.
The damage was a 2 1/2 amp fuse in the radio and that was it.
Luckily our early buses are made to withstand a nuclear event without a 
computerized fuel injection etc. So the reverse voltage just blew a fuse.
My bus will survive an EMP and it also survived owner stupidity!
