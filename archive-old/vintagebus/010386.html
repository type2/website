Just got home.  Had to leave the show immediately at judging time but they
were nice enough to do the Saddest Body award first because I had to leave.
Yep, I won it.!!!  YEAH BABY!   I've placed 2 years now with my POS 1967
bus.  Took 3rd last year in the VW bus special olympics.  :-)

The campout was great and it's going on through to tomorrow but I had to
leave in order to get home to drill my post holes tonight.

The weather was scorching hot today but we had an excellent turnout.  Most
of the buses there were Buskatiers and the ones that weren't, were at our
campout so yeah, it was good to see an increase in the bus turnout.

On the way home, I pushed my bus to see what it would do.  70 to 75 on the
Interstate, 60 to 65 on the freeway to home with oil temps never going above
210.  Got my EMPI GT Wheel back from Rob and I put it on my bus at the show.
Not as big at the stock one, a little less leverage on the steering, but
feels great on the highway.  I like it.

I gotta get to work - webcam is on.
