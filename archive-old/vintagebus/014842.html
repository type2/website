Subject: Gas Heaters for sale
Date: Wed, 19 Jan 2000 07:40:32 PST
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello all,
Yesterday I posted a desire to sell two gas heaters.  I was informed that my 
asking price of 150 each was way too expensive.  Fair enough. As I stated, I 
really don't know what they are worth.  So today the price, (as suggested by 
list members) is 50 bucks each.  Any takers?  I would also trade for almost 
anything I could use. Make an offer.

Boyd Smith
