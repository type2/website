Better put some HUGE washers, or better yet a large heavy piece of metal on
the back side of where ever you are bolting, and a LARGE number 8 grade
bolt, or those shoulder harnesses and belts are worthless.

In an accident, even a seat belt itself if it is old will rip and mounts
that are rusty, or poorly mounted will tear out in seconds.

You can't believe the forces present in an accident and being thrown around
in or from the vehicle is the fastest way to get seriously injured.  You and
your kids are MUCH safer if you stay secured to your seat.

&gt; What I have done Is drill out holes and used self tapping bolts to srcew in
&gt; the seat belt that I took out of a bay window bus. It works for my 2 kids 5
&gt; and 2 . hope this helps

&gt; Ever thought of going to the military surplus store and getting some crash
&gt; webbing, or maybe a lot of duct tape, or whatever. Heck, what do I know, I
&gt; drive a Single Cab !

&gt;&gt;&gt; Are there any other vintage Westy owners that also travel with toddlers
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; therefore deal with the car seat issue?  If so, I'd like to hear how
&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt; came
&gt;&gt;&gt; up with seatbelts or other restraints for the child car seat.
&gt; 
&gt; Have you done a visual to verify no mounts exist? My '67 Westy already had
&gt; the nut plates from the factory. Just removed the plastic plugs and
&gt; installed bay seatbelts.
&gt; Sorry if you already said, just got back on the list :)

&gt; I think it was in 66 that VW had seat belt mounts installed from factory in
&gt; the buses front and rear.   My 65 has them factory in front, none in rear.
&gt; My 61 came with no seat belt mounts.  Not sure when they started giving them
&gt; 
&gt; seat belt mounts stock in the front.
