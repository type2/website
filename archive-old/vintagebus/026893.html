&gt; I just need to know
&gt; where the brakes are adjusted on a 67 type 2(Singlecab).  I thought it
&gt; should be a slot in the backing plates where a flat driver could lever the
&gt; adjusting gear, but did not find a hole on my rear backing plates.  Where
&gt; and by what method do you adjust the fronts? rears?

There aren't any holes in the backing plates, at least not from the
factory. To adjust the brakes, take off the hubcap. You will see a hole
in the drum toward the outer edge, close to the wheel. You rotate the
wheel until the hole is lined up with your adjusting stars (you already
jacked up the end of the bus you're working on, right?). You might need
a flashlight to find them. If they haven't been adjusted in a while they
might be a little hard to see due to a coating of dust. Front and rear
adjust the same except for the location of the adjusters.
