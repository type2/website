Subject: A request for help from a Sacramento Area Listee.
Date: Thu, 3 Feb 2000 15:16:55 -0800 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hey all,
	
	Months ago, on the list, a '66 or '67 single cab at a Sacramento
Area junkyard was discussed.

	I was wondering if any of the Sacramento area listees will be going
to that junkyard anytime soon. 

	I need to see if   1. the thing is still there.  and 2. if the rear
window frame area is still present.

	Other listees have already taken other parts, so I know it is well
stripped.  I am just hoping that the one thing I am looking for is still
there.

	If anyone can help me out, please p-mail me.  THANKS!
