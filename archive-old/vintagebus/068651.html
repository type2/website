&gt; I'm not sure if anyone's mentioned this one before but
&gt; my wife &amp; I just sat through &quot;Almost Famous&quot; &amp; almost
&gt; had a bus-sighting overload.
&gt; It's set in the early 70's and is jam PACKED full of
&gt; split windows and a couple of bays as well.

And if you remember the scene where thay are at a party in Kansas (?) and 
some kids pull up in a Green/White deluxe and say &quot; Wanna hang out with some 
real people?&quot;

That bus belongs to none other than SV2's Prez John Winkley.

More useless drivel to fill your brain...
