If you look closley, the speedwell bus has dots like a half tone.
And did you see how the &quot;speedwell&quot; logo went through the bottom text.
Theres NO WAY an old school sign painter would do that.
It looked cool though, and it served the purpose the owner intended.
He had 8K cash in hand and the rusty non restorable bus was on a boat 
overseas.

&lt;&lt; Yeah, that bus does rock!  I'm a sucker for logo'd buses and made sure to
 get some good pictures of this one!  And the Speedwell bus...but I can't
 believe those logos were done recently.  Greg, you gotta get him to come up
 to SJ sometime! &gt;&gt;

Why can't you believe it? The bus has speedwell words and the kilowatt guy 
from the old electric company advertisments, not to mention a web site 
address.
