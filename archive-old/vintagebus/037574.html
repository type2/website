In a message dated 98-12-02 01:26:56 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; The 87mm slip-in p's and c's are really thin walled, and with any sort
 of prolonged highway driving are prone to warping and disfiguring,
 meaning an engine that wears out A LOT faster. They are great for the
 dunes, and in a dragster, but the thin-walled slip-ins are not good for
 a road engine. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jack,
We had heard the same and had misgivings when due to a flare up of Eric's
chronic illness we had to buy a rebuilt engine instead of building one
ourselfs.  We turned to a good friend knowned as Bear who had 20+ years
experience of rebuilding engines in the San Diego Ca area for this rebuild.
When it arrived we were a little worried that the 1600cc single port, dual
relief case, with counter balanced crank, and new heads with oversized exaust
valves stems was instead a 1641cc size.  The only other problem we had with
this engine was the head fins were clogged with casting flash (Two minutes
cleaning with circular saw with used carbide blade did 80% of the work.) and
the oil pressure was too high (60 Lbs. at 3,000 RPM when over 180F), which
need a different rear relief spring.  Except for first and reverse gear we
never go below 1,500 RPM and we only go above 3,000 RPM for less than 30
seconds at a time when shifting up gear especially when going up hill.  We
figured that worse thing that would happen with the engine was we would have
to change to 1600cc Ps&amp;Cs later if we had trouble with the oversized 1641cc.
So far since JULY 97 and till now NOV 98 we have driven it for 23,000 miles
with no problems getting 25+ MPG average at 63MPH at about 2,800 RPM with
3.875 R&amp;P tranny with stock 1964-67 reduction gear boxes in our 1960 panel
camper with full roof racks of stuff.  The main thing seems so far that if you
keep the RPMs down the cylinders even if thinner will be able to cool evenly,
this prevent warping and the thinner cylinders from not lasting as long as the
thicker cylinders.  Eric &amp; Barb    
PS The 1776 requires machining of the case which weakens a already weak type 1
&amp; 2 case.  Plus if the bore that the cylinders are installed in the case is
not radiused in the bottom corners you will at the very least get a crack in
the case forward of #3 cylinder.  If one wants lots of torque and HP plus
reliabilty of 200,000+ miles.  Then a type 4 engine 1700-2000cc converted to
upright would be the ticket.  We are looking at this conversion so we can have
a tow dolly with it's own brakes to tow buses home with our 1960 panel camper
in a year or two.  EEE&amp;B
