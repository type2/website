Subject: Re: [VB] Sump

Try the tech article on dry sump oiling for an overview of how it works:

http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/techguide.asp

The only thing I would add is an oil thermostat before the oil cooler so you
do not cool cold oil.  With this setup it would be very similar to a 911
oiling system.

People claim that a dry sump system give a HP boost over regular oil pan
systems, but I cannot explain why.  Probably negligible in a non racing VW.

I agree that it has no benefit in our busses since we do not corner fast...
Or go fast...  Or accelerate fast... Or stop fast...


Take Care,
