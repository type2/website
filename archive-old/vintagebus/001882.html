Harry - I tried suggestion #1 in my driveway tonight, but 50 mph wasn't fast
enough to accomplish the feat.  I did get some bad burns, but used my trusty
mortar&amp;pestle to grind up some ibuprofen into a paste, took a bath in it,
and it doesn't hurt at all now.  I do have a cool impression of the door
handle on my palm, so now I'm like that evil (german)guy from raiders of the
lost ark.  Do you have the wormhole guy's website handy?

There's more than one way to skin a cat, so there has to be more than one
way to turn a bus inside out. Weld a plate to the dashboard, hook a half
mile long steel cable to it, run it out the back hatch, attach it to an
immoveable object. Heat the bus until it's glowing white hot and drive as
fast as possible, jump out at the last second. Or you could wait until
Michiu Kaku finds a friendly wormhole to dip it in.
