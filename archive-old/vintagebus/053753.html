Subject:  trannies

Hello all,
I have a question about transmissions.
I have a 62 single that has a big nut tranny, with a 1600 dual port bolted
to it , I have never driven this truck but the PO told me that it popped out
of several gears and you had to hold it down on one of them. I need to get
this thing going as a work vehicle and I need a tranny. I have heard of
folks putting bug and type 3 swing axel trannies in their busses.   Is this
a feasible thing to do, What about the reduction boxes, do I just remove the
axels at the tranny and reattach them to the type 1 or type 3 tranny?
Thanks in advance
Bryan
