Subject: Re: [VB] Got it runing, but idles slow, unresponsive to 
  adjustment, still air...

&gt; &gt; Now, engien runs at 7.5 static timing, idles at a lopey 600rpm. Not very
&gt; &gt; repsonsive to throttle, needs a good  throttle level to get up there to
&gt; &gt; 1200 rpm. CHoke doesn't help much, without it won't idel at all.
&gt;
&gt; Sounds more like a blocked or badly sized pilot jet.  What are the jet sizes
&gt; you are using in it and are these sizes being confirmed by a jet gauge?

Make sure you dont have the wires wrong way round the dizzy.
