hi mike,

I have a spare engine (fianlly) that way if i blow one up i can be back on
the road the next day :)

Since i drive my busses exclusively, if i didnt have a spare engine i'd
have to rent a car until i could get my bus fixed in order to get to
work.  A spare engine is much cheaper..

I pretty much have a spare everything, but then again im a little odd. I
have a long line of packrat genes that i cannot escape, hehe.

take care,

Steve
