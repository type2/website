Says who? The seller? That's enough money to rebuild a *fleet* of bus
drivetrains.

&gt; The bus has plywood NAILED to the cargo floor.

Why would a bus have plywood on the floor? Maybe because the floor had
lots of big rust holes.

&gt; My friend offered him $2500. He talked himself down to $3000. We
&gt; walked.

Running would have been better, but walking away from this deal is good.

&gt; I told my friend to show up on his doorstep in a month or so with
&gt; $2500 in cash in one hand and in the other? A bunch of Grateful Dead
&gt; bootlegs. Your thoughts?

Jason Black got a reply off before I did that covered this pretty well.

This thing sounds like a *major* project. It's your friend's money
though. Maybe he needs to spend a little time reading the archives of
this list before he makes a decision.
