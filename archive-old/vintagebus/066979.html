Subject: Re: [VB] 6v to 12v inverter ?'s

Kevin,

That is a 470uF/16V capacitor, and can be replaced easily - a standard
part. This cap is polarized, which means that it has to go in one way,
not either way. Get the negative side into the negative hole if you
replace it. Also, replacing this part may not fix the unit, as it may
have exploded for a good reason - overvoltage, possibly applied to it by
another part's failure in the inverter somewhere.

If you use an inline fuse, you don't have to wire the radio up to
the fusebox. Just run it to any point that has your 12 Volts on it. And
ground it properly and well to get a good connection.

&gt; insides out. so i imagine that this inverter is no good. what is the likely

&gt; I think i need inline fuses somewhere, but i am not sure where. also i was
&gt; thinking of putting the radio some what remotely from the fuse box, would
&gt; this cause potential problems? should I run a separate wire directly from
&gt; the battery.
