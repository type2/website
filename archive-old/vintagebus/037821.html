&gt; Apples an oranges.

I like apple juice.

&gt; If my bus had been born a month earlier (march instead of april) then it might have been a barndoor.

I'm getting a Jeff Foxworthy thing here - &quot;If you have a Bus that was born before March, 1955, it might be a Barndoor.&quot;

Anyway, I think you mean February?  Or have I been duped by the man?
