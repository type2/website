Subject: Re: [VB] Wiring

The '65 wiring harness is fine.  You will run into a problem with the
flasher assembly.  The way I fix it is I buy one of these:

But I usually get the generic one from the local FLAPS for around $12.00.
This will do away with your odd little box, and if you know just a little
about the wiring (or can read and understand your wiring diagrams), this is
not hard.  As a matter of fact I just put one of these in my 1960 bus today
so I can try and get it inspected.  I didn't have any turn signals in the
rear until today, heh.

What this little box does it takes in your left flasher, right flasher, and
brake lights, and converts them for use on a single bulb setup like on the
rear of VW's.

&gt; Will I run into problems rewiring a 12volt convert with a '65 harness or
&gt; should I get something along the lines of a '67 harness ???
