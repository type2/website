Subject: Tire Pressures

I know this is a dumb question that I should just work out myself but I
thought I'd bend to the more experienced.
Situation: 66 Westy
Tire size front 205 14/75R
Tire size rear 215 14/75R
Using this info what would be a tire pressure that might slow down the
steering job in heavy cross winds?.
I'm currently running 30 front and 32 rear, it drives good with these
presures on days with very little wind.
The only other things, it's running a ball joint front suspension, IRS on
the rear and a rear sway bar.
