Subject: Towing a bus with a bus
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, since I'd recently installed a westy hitch, and last week I bought
Jeff Carver's bus tow bar, I decided to put the two together and see what
would happen.  

I dragged the '55 single cab out of the back yard, bolted up the tow bar,
hitch it up to the '60, and too it all for a spin.

Everything went OK.   You can definitely feel the load, but it didn't seem
like it was really strainging the bus at all.   Braking was a bit
interesting though.  I took the whole thing up to about 60mph, but I think
that's a bit too fast.  I could definitely feel the influence of the towed
vehicle, and I could feel it pushing when I was trying to bring the whole
mess to a stop.

This isn't something I'd want to do all the time, but would work great in a
pinch for an emergency or a short-trip bus rescue.
