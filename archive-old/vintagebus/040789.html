&gt; I doubt if the employees were at fault. Usually it is poor
&gt; management or an unwillingness to keep up with changing
&gt; times that causes a business to fail.


More to the point, it's when cost of doing business exceeds profits, whether
that is due to poor management or other factors.  Barrett ran multi-page
two-color ads in every issue of every VW magazine. Same with Johnny's.  This
probably cost them a good ten grand a month in advertising alone.  Based on
typical net profit of a discount mail order VW parts business (after paying
rent, payroll, etc.), they'd have had to sell about $1 million in parts a
year **just to pay for the ads!**   That's a lot of $10 wheel cyliders just
to break even. So what do they do?  They count on huge volume every single
month, because with that kind of overhead, just one or two soft months could
kill you. (Notice that most of these businesses fail near the end of the
winter, typically the slow season for VW mail order sales.) Then if sales
drop, they have to either cut corners somewhere else (such as parts quality,
i.e. substituting Indian wheel cylinders for the Brazilian ones), or simply
take on debt and hope business picks up again before the creditors come
knocking.  That's why it doesn't surprise me that many of the places that
run those laundry-list style multi-page ads in the mags come and go.
Selling parts at those prices is easy (I do it all day long), but doing it
while paying hundreds of thousands in fixed overhead can be very difficult
to sustain.
