Hey Volks

The four berths in my 63 Dormobile are now one short for my newly
reconstituted family. I have the front cot from an early bay westy, the one
that goes above the front seats.

I want to cut it down fit the Dormer, but I don't have the little brakets
the bunk hangs off, the ones screwed in to on the A and B pillars.

Can anyone help out?
