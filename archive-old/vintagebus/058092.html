On my way to work this morning and spotted a blue/white standard with a
dalmation's pattern of primer on it. It was at the corner of Ford Road &amp;
MacArther in Newport Beach, CA _at_ 8:50am. I was in my yellow GTI, so
couldn't do the cool bus-2-bus wave/nod/whatever...
 
Probably not anyone on the list, but I see splits so rarely that I was
excited about it and wanted to share!
