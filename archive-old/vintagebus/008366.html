&gt;  Now the auto recyclers have another potential customer for &gt;some of the
early iron they're already
&gt;processing.

&gt;Here's the actual text of the bill:

http://www.leginfo_dot_ca_dot_gov/pub/bill/asm/ab_1351-1400/ab_1390_bill_20010416_am
ended_asm.html

I don't believe the recyclers can sell/donate to the program..... has to be
a private party.
And the really crappy thing is the cars get crushed whole... they CANNOT
sell any parts off them. Section 43003 paragraph (1) ''......turns in a
pre-1970 vehicle to that manufacturer for destruction.''  It annoyed me when
I watched complete running buses get crushed under the last program
California did to get cars off the road that wouldn't pass smog checks. Most
of them failed the visual test because the FI was replaced by a Weber etc.
