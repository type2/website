&lt;&lt; Zinc primer the rims before P.C. &gt;&gt;
Hi Larry,
Just to make this clearer.  :-)  The powdercoating place after sandblasting 
you rims can and will powder coat your parts with this zinc primer which was 
designed for Marine (Salt water!) protection (Zinc plating, dipping or 
primering prevents rust from tunneling under normal paint or the color powder 
coatings.) then apply the color powder coating.
  When we had only a color coating on the first rims we had done the cranny 
between the inner and outer parts of the rims rusted quickly and we even had 
some rust show through on the sharp outer corners of the rims.  We used a 
fine paint brush to apply roofing tar into this area to seal out the water 
and stop any rust in there.  
  We recently have installed two rims with the zinc primered overall, black 
80% semi gloss on the inside and where the tire rides on and a white that was 
closest to pearl white as we could find on the outside of the rim.  This 
special ordered white color was called Chamelon and is NLA now so we had the 
80% semi-gloss black applied just like the VW factory to stetch the white 
color we had.  Have found some rusting still in the cranny on one of these 
two rims so we will go ahead and paint tar in the cranny to prevent this 
problem.   
  The ultimate would be to have the rims to a zinc plater to be bead blasted, 
acid dipped and plated with zinc.  Then taken to the powder coater for the 
zinc primer and color powder coatings!   
Does anyone in the NW of USA know of a reasonable to work with, zinc plater 
and/or dipper?   Eric&amp;Barb
