&gt; The best route is to buy the correct German muffler, and all of the proper
&gt; pipes and brackets.  Those were hard to find 15 years ago, the last time I
&gt; shopped for an exhaust...


I have complete German exhaust systems for $99.95.  These are complete kits,
with muffler, damper pipe, tailpipe, brackets, hardware, etc.  They fit
1500-1600cc engines, and yes, they are Bus kits (single-tailpipe) not bug
kits.  The good German stuff has indeed been hard to find in the U.S. for a
while (and terribly expensive when available), so I've been importing these
directly from Germany myself.
