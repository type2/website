Subject: a Phriday question

Volks,

I am wondering about the availability of water tanks to replace the originals
in split Westies and early loafs, 72 and earlier.  I have been looking for
them, but haven't seen any on line or in catalogs.  I have to wonder about the
safety of these old plastic tanks.  How do you clean them out if they've not
been used in a month of Shundays?  Leaks?  Repairs?

My son and I picked up a '72 loaf westy sans its tent, for only 500 bucks.  No
rust, and the interior is half decent, just needs new fauset, but we have no
idea yet what condition the tank is in.  Still too cold to work on it really,
but it will start to warm up come March and April.

Best to all,

Curt
