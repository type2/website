Subject: Re: [VB] misplaced engine list post

&gt; Hey list.  Did any one save that superb breakdown of
&gt; engines available for type2s and their hp ratings?  I
&gt; would like you to send it to me for future knowledge. 
&gt; For those of you on the list who take the effort to
&gt; look up parts numbers and prodution dates, thank you. 
&gt; For those of us without libraries you are an
&gt; irreplaceable help.
 
This one for Type IV engines?

Do not go by the reference that GE is 79 Calif-only. It is wrong.
GE is 78-up, all states, with hydraulic lifters.
