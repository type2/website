Subject: Re: [VB] resistance question

Hey, thanks for the numbers....didn't think to check rotor resistance, but
I'll definitely replace that coil-to-cap wire. hmmm....maybe it wasn't the
coil at all causing the weak spark, but too much resistance in the wire? I
was checking the coil by holding the cap end of the wire close to bare metal
and turning the engine over by hand. Muir book said orange means bad coil,
yellow is ok, blue/white is best. I might have an extra coil!

Also, thanks to those who gave advice about the battery stuff. I just left
it on with the charger at 6 amps and eventually it stopped flipping out. The
battery seems to hold a charge, and I had to add quite a bit of water, but
only time will tell if I hurt it badly.

Alex

&gt; the coil to cap wire should have 0 (zero) ohms (horseshoes) resistance.
&gt; i've had bad coil wires, and replacing them made the world of difference.
&gt; the cap to plug wires themselves rarely go bad in terms of resistance,
it's
&gt; almost always the end connectors that screw on to the wires. connector
&gt; resistance, according to the vw service manual for bug 70-79 states 5000
to
&gt; 10,000 ohms (horseshoes)
&gt; rotor resistance should be no more than 10,000 ohms (horseshoes)

&gt; &gt; Hey all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm finally getting into the '65 Kombi that I just bought, doing the
&gt; tune-up, valves, all that good stuff. I found that the coil was just
&gt; putting out a wimpy orange spark at the dizzy wire, so I figured I'd get a
&gt; new one since it looks like the original coil. While I was in there,
&gt; though, I checked the resistance of the coil-to-dizzy wire and found it to
&gt; be 5K ohms. This seems awfully high for a 6&quot; wire with no resistor cap. Is
&gt; it time for a new wire? I then checked resistance in the #2 spark plug
wire
&gt; and found it to be 2K ohms (all the way to the cap), which doesn't
surprise
&gt; me for a sparkplug wire. My BMW motorcycle (also aircooled) specifies 5K
&gt; Ohm resistance in the sparkplug wires (actually, the resistor is in the
&gt; cap), and I was wondering if there is also a standard for VWs. Anyone,
&gt; anyone.....
&gt; &gt;
