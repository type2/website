Kelly,

Yes, I agree too, but I just hate cutting something up that would be 
fixable. I have a problem with folks cutting/parting out things just to get 
more money than if they had sold it whole to someone who would fix it up. I 
know there are some that cant be fixed and should be used as donor car/bus 
and thats fine. They just dont make these anymore and if we keep parting out 
the good/decent ones, we wont have anything left to restore. I just need to 
find a bus thats been totalled from the backside...HINT HINT if anyone in 
the southeast has one.

BTW, there is a bus show in Jacksonville Beach this Sat. Sat is just busses 
and Sunday is all VWs. Check out the bus info at:

&gt;I agree with Thom ,,it depends on how much your willing to spend on it
&gt;,,Robert is also rite as for frame damage but it appears to have been hit
&gt;headlight high or so ,but cking the frame is the first thought ,,,if so you
&gt;can still split the frame behind or just in front of the bulkhead,,but your
&gt;call as to the feasiblity of that on this particular bus ,,on the 56 
&gt;standard
&gt;sunroof in the shop the owner optedto do that ,,his call not mine ,,i can 
&gt;fix
&gt;most anything with-in reason and funds ,,GRIN ,,later
