Apparently your site works only with Internet Explorer, and not Netscape
(you get a blank page).  Looks good on IE though.  Anything you can do
to fix?

&gt; Hey list,
&gt;  Finally got my trucks ONLY site up to releasable status (at least i think
&gt; so). Contains pretty much everything for a truck fan. Year to year with
&gt; pics, restoration help, truck m-codes, truck toys, truck literature,
&gt; accessories,etc. Even got some old commercials in wav format. Go check it
&gt; out and lemme know what you guys think, or if you see probs. I tried to make
&gt; it a point not to have pics that other sites have, so most everything you
&gt; see will be new. More to follow as time allows.
