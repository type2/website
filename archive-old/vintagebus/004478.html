Round on one end, rectangular on the other, made of white plastic. The
rectangular end fits into the channels above your windshield and the round
end snaps into metal snaps that come on a cloth roll, like tape. The roll of
snaps gets sewn into the fabric of the curtain.
I believe they're made by &quot;Remcar&quot; I have a package at home if anyone wants
more detail.
The sliders match the channel on my split bus exactly.

Subject: [VB] westy curtain sliders


&gt; Hello Everyone,
&gt; This past weekend I found another butterscotch plaid front curtain from a
71
&gt; westy.  I am going to use to make the front sliding curtains for my 67
&gt; westy.  I have the tracks intact but I don't have the sliders to attach to
&gt; the curtains.  Are these available anywhere? Someone suggested the local
RV
&gt; supplier, but I don't know what the original looked like.  Any help would
be
&gt; appreciated.
&gt;

&gt; 63 deluxe (someday)
&gt; 69 Westy  (driving me crazy)
&gt; 74 beetle (I have no Idea why it's in the yard)
