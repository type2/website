&gt;wound in the head, laid up in the hospital and no bus.  My memory fails me
&gt;slightly, but I think he was either paralyzed to certain degree or just
laid
&gt;up for a long time.  To me, the &quot;child&quot; analogy is ridiculous.  I am a
&gt;father and I would die for my child, not my bus.


I wouldn't figure on dying for my bus either. Anybody tries to take my
property, it wouldn't be me that would be dying for it. It would be the
unfortunate, illiterate, child-abused, misunderstood, victimized thief that
didn't receive adequate public education to know that he needed to bring a
bigger gun. And more of them. Someone tries to take your property because it
is easier than working for a living. Do the math. If more criminals thought
it was harder to steal than to work, there would be more workers and less
thieves. Letting someone take something rather than trying to stop them is
like trying to stop poverty by giving people money. Simple, idealogical, but
impossible. Runs counter to human nature.

A simple DPST relay kill switch is enough for the single cab. Kills the
ignition and fuel pump. A tow truck can take them no matter what you rig up.
With the exception of the Westfailure. Then they'll need a bigger truck,
too. And some big brass cajones.
