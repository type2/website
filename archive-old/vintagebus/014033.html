Hey guys, 
  I think the first mistake you are making is living in that bastion of middle class psuedo-elitism that is suburbia.

I think if you live in a place that won't let you park your bus in the front yard you've either got the wrong vehicle or the wrong yard.

It's  like going to a country club and bitching because they won't let you wear your &quot;F&amp;ck More. B!tch Less.&quot; T-shirt
 
The type that would strive to achieve this middle-class suburban sterility would seem like a contradiction to me if they happened to also be a VW bus enthusiast, but thats just me.
 
Check out the P.J.Orourke's article in last month's (maybe this month) Rolling Stone titled &quot;I Hate Suburbia&quot;
He says it best there.
