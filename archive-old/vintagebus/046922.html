 Make sure you have the captive nut for the engine mount behind the oil 
cooler.
 It really is almost impossible to get to after you put the engine in.  We 
know
 this from first hand experience.  We ran on 3 bolts for a while until we 
pulled
 the engine again.  This is actually the way we got it, with only 3 bolts 
thanks
 to the PO.  He left the starter bolt out.  It ran that way for 6 months for 
us.

funny thing is that although I know many people like the captive nut, I dont. 
 Free the Nut!   I find it easier to put a nut on it and turn it inside the 
engine compartment.   Awkward to get it past the clutch arm etc, for me at 
least.  Some cases take the half moon on that side, keeps them from turning.  
 For the ones that dont, I have a nifty tool that has a magnetic hex 17mm 
thing and arms to keep it from turning.   Use a ratchet wrench in the engine 
compartment.   If people want the captive nuts, I have a couple I removed 
from cases.
