Subject: Re: [T2] I wanna...

I should add something to make it more clear.  You can use 6 volt blower
motors on a 12 volt heater, but you must use them as a pair, you can't use
one 6 and one 12.  The 6 volt motors are wired together in series since they
cycle at the same time.

&gt; John, the south winds are really easy to work on and put together from just
&gt; parts and pieces.  Check each piece out per the manual before you assemble
&gt; it.  If you find a couple parts heaters, and you can mix the 6 and 12 volt
&gt; sheet metal parts together with the exception of the motors, actuator
&gt; solienod (in the metal cup on the end of the burner) and the coil.  I bet
&gt; you could put a working one together.  Parts heaters are easier to find and
&gt; much cheaper, plus you will know it has freshly checked parts in it.  I have
&gt; all the rebuild parts and manuals at:

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Hey All,
&gt;&gt; I am looking for a 6 volt Southwind\Stewart warner gas heater (12 volt could
&gt;&gt; also work).  Can be from a bug or bus, doesn't matter, but preferably it
&gt;&gt; would
&gt;&gt; be complete &amp; working.  I have a TON of stuff to trade including an
&gt;&gt; Eberspacher early BN4 (although it has a dead coil, it still has all other
&gt;&gt; parts including glow\spark plugs and fuel pump), as well as ANYTHING you
&gt;&gt; would
&gt;&gt; need (except seats and interior panels) from a '66 kombi, including an entire
&gt;&gt; 1500 engine. Or I can buy outright for cash, but I prefer to trade. Anyone
&gt;&gt; wanna do some bartering?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;
