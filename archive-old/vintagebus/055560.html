Subject: Re: [VB] Marin Show.........

I really hope that the barndoor doesn't get that
treatment. What a shame it would be for all that work
to go to waste. Yes, waste. If you want to do
something as stupid as that to a car, please go buy a
5.0 and leave the vintage cars for people who
appreciate them.

&gt; Heard some interesting stories at the Marin show
&gt; today.  
&gt;   
&gt; Seems the Mark (the guy in the pictures cutting up
&gt; the RHD BD Panel) is going the John Jones route and
&gt; building a DD 15 window with BD front clip, and if
&gt; that's not good enough. Thom's ex 54 RHD Deluxe will
&gt; soon be seen sporting air suspension and hammered in
&gt; the dirt. The best quote I heard regarding this was
&gt; &quot;This will be the last Kelly Park for him. Someone's
&gt; going to kick his _at_$$ for that&quot; I say do what you
&gt; want it's your money / VW, just not the road most
&gt; would take with the same Bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Also the &quot;56&quot; Single Cab pictured on Sam and/or
&gt; Nicks web page is actually Thom's old '55 that a
&gt; buddy of mine bought last Tuesday. Drives it
&gt; everyday and loves it!! Good deal for him and now
&gt; Thom has more room at his place to play with his
&gt; Porsches. Good for him too!
