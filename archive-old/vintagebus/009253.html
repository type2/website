I've written a couple of times about Fram's marine [gasoline] fuel filter,
which uses a replaceable cartridge and has a plug in the bottom for draining
off accumulated water.

It's simple to add a fuel shutoff valve, threading it into the input nipple
on the filter housing.  This allows the fuel flow to be stopped while you
replace the cartridge.

Most any boating/marine supply has these in stock.

&gt;&gt; Personally, I am looking for a marine filter that has a sediment bowl AND
a cut off valve; placing that between pump and tank should do the trick. &lt;&lt;
