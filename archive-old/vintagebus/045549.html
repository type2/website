&lt;&lt;  I don't know if it will be noticeable as I'm using the 
 solid front adapter mount for the nosecone.

I'm also putting one of these in the 59', I was thinking about trimming a 
thinish piece of rubber to put between the mating surfaces or the tranny and 
mount, Any thoghts as to whether this would have any efect on noise/vibration?
