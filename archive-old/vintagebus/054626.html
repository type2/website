Subject: Weird '71 spotted- need info...

Today I located a weird bus and hope for
clarification. Apologies ahead of time for the baybus
question- but here it goes:

VIN = 231-2090-570 confirmed behind psgr. side seat,
door pillar sticker of driver side and dashboard VIN
tag. Sticker clearly reads 11/70 as production date
(for 1971 model year).

Weirdness:
1.&gt; Odd VIN with &quot;Type 23&quot; in Mcode/VIN tag.
My ancient 1993 Wolfsburg West catalog quotes first
three digits of VINs as follows
1968-1969 VINs as starting with 218 and 219.
1970- starts with 210 progressing to a 212 by the end
of 1972.
2.&gt; Bench model! 1/3-2/3 seat
3.&gt; No interior push-pull door lock knobs on front
doors. (no hole or mechanisms per factory)
4.&gt; No interior slider lock handle/switch.
5.&gt; Factory roof indentation &lt;exterior&gt; 3&quot; x 1/8&quot; deep
x width of roof.
6.&gt; Shortie bumper over-riders with rubber pads.
Barely taller than bumper blade top/btm.
7.&gt; Ker-*Delog*-Bund front windshield logo (is this
common? I thought that name was only in old splits.
8.&gt; US spec turn signal/stop lights frnt/rr.
9.&gt; MANUAL choke knob in front seat stand ala 1950's
splitty. Heater knob on dash as all bays.
10.&gt; Vynil headliner over driver/psgr area only.

Bus is in great straight condition with worn OG paint.

Being a splittie guy I am surprised on the oddities. I
have heard/read of the benchseat model bays before.
eight pgr vs. seven?

Please fill me in via pmail at ellisjames_at_yahoo_dot_com
Thanks,
-Ellis\
