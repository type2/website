At your typical highway speeds the force of the air pressure is not small as
mentioned.  There is more air than you engine blows out at the intake of the
scoops, thus pressure is built.     You are correct that the surface area of
the louvers are greater than the typical air scoop and may restrict air flow
for stock.  Of course you are not always at highway speeds.  At lower speeds,
typically your engine is running slower and not using large volumes of air
and not utilizing all the stock intake has to offer..  Unless of course you
are climbing a hill in 2nd. But thinking of this before hand, I do not have
your typical air scoop that runs the length of the louvers.  I have custom
air scoops.  Mine are only in depth about a 1/4 of the length of the louvers,
thus not lessening the available surface area of the air intake.  But you
know what?  Who cares.  The damn things are ugly no matter what and should
not be put on a bus.  Unless it is an ugly bus like my wifes &quot;Rosie the Rusty
Westy&quot;.

&gt; &gt; I doubt they reduce the air intake.  By design they force air into
&gt; the engine
&gt; &gt; compartment.  They could'nt help but to do that.  This is good
&gt; especially if
&gt;
&gt; Find the open area of one of your intake louvers.  Multiply this by
&gt; the number of louvers.  Now find the open area of the scoop.  If the
&gt; open area of the scoop is less than that of the louvers then the scoop
&gt; will be the restriction in the system.
