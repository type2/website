Table on icebox:
12&quot;x15&quot;
all four corners rounded, fillet radius 2&quot;

Table on cargo door:
15&quot;x21&quot;
two corners rounded, opposite side from hinge, fillet radius 2&quot;

Both tables are made of approximately 5/8&quot; plywood with laminate top.
Edged with an aluminum (I think) trim.

I don't have a spice cabinet either. Would you please share the plans
for this if you come across them.

Unfortunately my Sundial is missing the spice rack on the cargo door.
Does
anyone have the dimensions of this or a source for plans?  Also the 2
small
fold down tables are gone, one is on the other cargo door and the
other is
next to the icebox.  Anyone have the dimensions for these or a source
to
buy?  I would even buy an original spice rack if the price was right.
  One more thing the vinyl flooring is a bit beat up and the wood
underneath
it has what looks like some water damage, but not in too bad shape
after
having two layers of carpet over it for who know how many years.
Could I
restore this original vinyl and if so what would be the steps to go
about
doing it?  I think I can use some of that industrial strength floor
wax and
buff it out, but I'm worried about the wood beneath it.

Thanks
  Bart Daugherty
