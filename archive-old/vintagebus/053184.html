&gt; 1. I didn't see a torque rating for the torsion bar set screw and lock 
&gt; nut. I used 25 foot lbs. for both.

Hi Conrad,
We have had no luck finding this info for type 2 and the type 2 shop manual 
only shows tightening them with a hand tool with no way for torque readings.  
For the type 3 it shows to be 22 and 29 for those.  So you are probably close 
enough!
  As for snubber rubber you should be able to replace it with everything else 
in place.  You will probably will just need to jak it up a bit to get some 
room in there.
