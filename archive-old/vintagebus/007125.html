&gt; O.K. guys, here is what I remember from about 20yrs. ago.
&gt; The RV industry was pushing the water injection as a cure for detonation
&gt; caused by poor gas and the heavy loads that the big RV's had to pull. Also
&gt; some of the people selling the various systems touted a slight improvement
&gt; in gas mileage. There were articles on it in several RV magazines and a
few
&gt; tests that really didn't prove anything (IMHO).
&gt;
&gt; From what I've seen in the last few years, the water injection has slowly
&gt; gone the way of the &quot;widget&quot;.

&gt; &gt; Interesting, but I've found that water vapor isn't nearly as combustible
&gt; &gt; as gasoline..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Some of the turbo kids run water injection, which is supposed to have
&gt; &gt; some cooling effect to prevent detonation.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I had a friend in high school that was talking about doing this.  I
&gt; think he did it but don't remember the results.  I think the idea is that
&gt; the water vapor expands more than air, but it is really late and I am
really
&gt; tired.  I should look it up tomorrow just for grins.
