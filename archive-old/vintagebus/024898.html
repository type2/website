I got in a hurry on that last post and forgot to point out that the
whole reason for the steps I described are so you can pull the axle
tube off the axle. That will allow you to take the tube and reduction
gear box to a shop to have the plug pulled. You can also take
advantage of the opportunity to get the top inner bearing out by
knocking out from the inside. As inexpensive as bearings are, I would
replace them all while I had the box apart.
