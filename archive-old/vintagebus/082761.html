Subject: Re: [VB] Re: tires

With all the talk about tires, I went and checked what I am using:

1. On my '59 SC, Starfire, Fliteline IV, P195/75R15

2. On my '63 bus: Cooper Trendsetter P205/175R15

3. On my '61 Westy: Remington Endeavor 205/75R/15.

Comments: I am very pleased with the tires. The Coopers do throw the 
speedo off, but I wanted a taller tire.  The Remingtons seem a bit 
mushy, but maybe I'm carrying too much weight in the camper.  Over all 
I've no problem with the tires and would not hesitate to buy these 
brands again.  I've had these on the vehicles for a long time and my 
local dealer could not re-stock some of the above brands- hence the 
changes.
