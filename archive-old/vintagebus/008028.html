&gt; I installed a 035 distributer w/the vacuum advance.  My old bus engine
&gt; seemed to have no problem with the 009 in it though.  Timing is at the
tick
&gt; mark (10 BTDC) as the Muir indicates.  I still have the same hesitation
&gt; problem.  If I turn the distributer to advance the timing the engine RPM's
&gt; raise and it runs smoother, and the hesitation is less severe.  I didn't
&gt; leave it there in case of some problem that might occur that I don't know
of
&gt; yet.  It seems to have a slight backfire during the hesitation.


Are you SURE the mark on the pulley is TDC???

Remove the left valve cover. Rotate the engine in the direction of rotation.
Watch #3 cylinder [the front one] rocker arms. After no movement of either
rocker arm, you will see the exhaust open and close, then the intake will
open and close. If the exhaust does not open first, you are turning the
crank the wrong way. When you are sure you are going the right way, keep
going around. Watch the exhaust open then just almost close. STOP. Turn
slowly and just as the exhaust closes and the intake just starts to move
STOP. Look at the timing mark on the pulley. Any of them sitting right on
the seam? If yes, that one is Top Dead Center. If no, paint a mark on the
pulley  at the seam joint, cause you have no TDC mark on the pulley.
