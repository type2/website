I stopped at a local bug shop and he had a Rayjay turbo charger hanging on 
the wall if anyone is interested.  He quoted $700 complete or $500 without 
the carb.  He has tons and tons of engine parts, some 36 but mostly 60's 
stuff.  Call Wayne Buggy Repair at 530-671-2441.  This is in Yuba City , CA. 
  Have fun.
