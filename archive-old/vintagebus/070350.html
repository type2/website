Subject: porsche parts manual for sale

i have a porsche 914/914-b parts catalog for sale (to fund my 
never-ending engine rebuild)... it seems to be a xerox or an offset 
print repro, NOT an original, but it has raised ink and is on thick, 
coated paper. anyways, it is in excellent shape - a few rear pages 
have the ink adhering to the adjacent page - and is far fatter than 
the 67-down bentley! dated 1/73.
$50 and i'll pay shipping sound fair?
