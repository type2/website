Subject: Re: [VB] How to mask for 2 tone paint

I used that THICK bright blue stuff. Didnt have any problems.
Painted the ENTIRE bus red. And then masked and painted the top half white.
Even put flattner in the paint. Broke out the buffing wheel and buffed 
through on the roof till the red showed through.......whoops, I had an 
original paint deluxe.

&gt; use the
&gt; 3m stuff, not the bargain basement crap

and make sure you use the cream color masking tape.  The widest you can get.
Put on 4 or so strips on top of one another as to stack it up like
bricks...because that paint goes all over.  I am now doing this since my first
swipe was with only 2 strips.  its a slight overspray..barely noticeable..but
I'm trying to do the best I can.

DON'T buy that crappy brown paint masking tape that 3M sells.  Its sticky on
half of the tape and doesn't stick worth a hoot.  A waste of $4.
