Uhhh, but what would be the benefit of hemp slip on seat covers? Is there 
really a market for that?

sounds nicer than vinyl (real vinyl leatherette) to me, and sturdy.   I now 
have black corduroy seat covers I made 4 years ago in my 65 westy, and the 
corduroy is starting to thin on the drivers seat.  I was thinking about 
switching seats, as I had found a nice 1/3 2/3 seats since I got the bus, 
both with good stock upholstery and stuffing,  but the 1/3 is not the same as 
the 2/3 in terms of material, and neither are stock colours for a 65, so ... 
slip on covers.  I have some that have white/black cow patterns (looks like a 
cow, not pics of cows) in fuzzy stuff, might use that.  I dont like vinyl 
seats.  I know it is stock, but it is cold in the winter and too hot in the 
summer.  Hemp slip on covers could work for me.
