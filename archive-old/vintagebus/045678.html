&lt;&lt; these are not on all pre 64 rear hatches.  AAMAF, I think it is a late

  From what I have heard, it was for 61 and up buses. Thats how you can tell a
60 from a 61 in a wink (if it hasnt been changed of course), but, and isn't
there always a but. A friends all original 63 deluxe is minus the half moon???
Maybe Gunther found an early hatch behind a press and decided to use it?
