Subject: Rear seat belt retrofitting

Champions of bus-lore,

First, a shout out to Wolfsburg West. I ordered three bus-specific application seatbelts from them yesterday at 3pm PST and upon arriving at work this morning, was notified that they were already on a fedex truck in my town. Damn!

Okay, My '65 had holes with OEM mounting plates and bolts thru the wheel wells, but not in the sloping rear sheetmetal in front of the gastank like my later baywindows.

There is a hodgepodge of 3/8&quot; holes drilled thru my floor, but they seem DPO related and not structurally sound.

How to mount my new belts?

I'm thinking of running a long piece of barstock or c-channel/unistrut under the bus between the framerails to mount to.

Has anybody dealt with this. #3 is on the way and we need seatbelts!

thanks,

Billy
