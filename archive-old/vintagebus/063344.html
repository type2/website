Subject: Re: [VB] Cotter pins

&gt;
&gt;&gt;So check your fuel lines and make sure the cotter pins in the rear=20
&gt;&gt;axle nuts are still there...
&gt;
&gt;What are the cotter pins? Could someone explain it to me?=20

It's a long, thin piece of steel that is folded over into a U shape.
The legs of the U go through a hole and are bent outwards to hold
the pin in place.  A cotter pin is usually used on a shaft or axle
to keep a nut from coming lose.

http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5054part/170.jpg has a picture
of how it is used on a Bus.  The pin is number 17.  There is a hole
drilled in the axle (number 15) for the pin to go through.  It keeps
the nut (number 16) from coming off the axle.=20

http://www.switchgearmusic_dot_com/~bluedawg/vespafaq/body/rbrake/rbrake10.jpg
has a photograph and a drawing.  In the drawing, the cotter pin is red.=20

&gt;I'm sorry but my knowledge of the english technical terms is not=20
&gt;very deep.

That's OK, my knowledge of Portugese technical terms is even worse.
:)  EuroDicAutom at http://europa.eu.int/eurodicautom/login.jsp
suggests &quot;tro=E7o&quot;, &quot;perno&quot;, &quot;cavilha ranhurada&quot;, &quot;pino ranhurado&quot;, or
&quot;perno ranhurado&quot; as possible Portugese translations.

Thanks=20
