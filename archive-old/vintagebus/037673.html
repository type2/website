Rex and other listees,

I hope to have just that whenever I find the time to
get a webpage up and running!!  In the meantime if
there are questions that you think that I can help with
just put something to the effect of 'transaxles' or 
'gearing' in the subject line to get my attention.  If I 
am just hammered with work and emails (like now!)
I usually delete all other subjects so I can concentrate
on those questions that I can help the most with.

Thanks!
