Did you take the measurements of this bag and apply
them to a Westy roof rack? Your implying that it fits
inside the Westy roof rack. Surely your not saying go
with this in place of a westy roof rack !?

Ellis replies:
I did not measure anything. I looked at the Sunday
newspaper insert and typed in the text and described
the photo. Bag is intended to go on the roofrack of an
SUV. You know, those racks that look like they are
totally useless? ;-) To me it looks perfect for
putting one inside of a westy rack or two if you have
a 3/4-full rack. Looks good to me for Summer rainy
weather travel/camping. Better than having all of your
over priced NOS mudvalves exposed to the elements as
you travel to shows. Minimizes the &quot;Jethro Clampett&quot;
piled up crap on the rack scene.
