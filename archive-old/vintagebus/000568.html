This letter was sent to Aaron but He thought that I should let all of you 
know about what happened to me and I would especially like to send this out 
to all those on the list that live in or around Vancouver, Canada. 

The name of the so called mechanic is Felix Trip
 and the biz is called Tripp motors. please do not go there, or you might get 
the same treatment I did. 

Please read on.

Hi Aaron,

I'm sorry that I took so long to get back to you I ran into a a very bad 
experience of having a burt #1 ex valve and had to rip my engine apart. When 
I did that I found out that I had been swindled big time! I first bought the 
rebuilt engine, or so I thought, that I had a bunch of problems with before I 
left for my trip. then when I took it back to the guy who built it (trained 
in VW school). Then he told me that he had sold me an engine that was used 
and it was out of a sand rail that had 50 hrs on it! After a big argument he 
re-ringed it and was supposed to put two new heads (complete), on it. He 
charged me $600 for the work which was only supposed to be for parts luckily, 
I made a deal that I would pay him when I get got back from my trip. Since I 
did not have the money and that he swindled me anyway. Did comp check and 
found that #1 was holding nothing. So i took the engine out and pulled the 
head off. Well, when I took it apart and looked at the #1&amp;2 head I found that 
he had put a new head on but put old valves in it that had about 100,000 
miles on them, and I only put 4000kms and they had huge pits! So I took off 
the other head and found the same thing on the other side as well, and he 
also stripped two spark plug holes! To top it all off he would not warranty 
any of it! Anyway I found this guy where my engine died in a place called 
Vernon BC, Canada. That is exactly like mouldoon in Miur's book. He let me 
work on it and gave me spot in the back and let me use his shop to work in 
and all of his tools.  I did a complete valve job and found out that my carbs 
that I bought from the same guy were set wrong (floats) so I set those exact. 
In the end I got a ring job and 4 new ex, and 2 new intake valves plus some 
other parts that I needed for 150 bucks! what a deal!  anyway that is why 
took me so long.

We agreed on $35 plus shipping. I will see if I can send it cod on the hound 
and you should give me you particulars so that I can get that to you asap.

Thanx,
chris.
