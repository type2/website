Subject: RE: [VB] electrical question/fuse box

Actually they did.  Take a look at newer fuse boxes from the '70s.  The ones
that also held the relays like in a Bus or Beetle.  You will see that the
brass stampings that make up the bus bars/male spades and fuse holders are
soldered

i had thought about this...soldering the connections in the fuse box-as it
appears as though these connections are not very good. But it seemed like
there might be reason not too-or some reason they(vw) never did.
