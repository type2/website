Subject: screen saver pics

I'm still looking for pictures of your Splitties, Loaf, Vanagons, and
Eurovans for inclusion in model specific screen savers like the Vanagon one
I have on my site.

I've got lots of great Vanagon pictures but am really short of the others.
I may end up doing a Splittie/Loaf and Vanagon/Eurovan saver if I don't get
more pictures.  I'm also going to create one huge everything saver for those
who want it all.

So send them in!!!
