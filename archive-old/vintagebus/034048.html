I can remember  breaking down in my 67 westy a few times when I lived out 
east. Once coming from a vw show, I want to say in Farmington. I was passed 
by countless vws, one stopped mostly interested in whether or not the bus was 
for sale. Coming from the dead in Charlotte I broke an accelerator cable, no 
less than 5 people stopped in the 25-30 min I was there, None with much 
mechanical knowledge, but all willing and WANTING to help in any way they 
could. Not trying to say that everyone who goes to see phish and dead related 
projects are all good honest helpful folks, But I don't think you could say 
that about any group. 
    Its odd to me people are so prejudice against hippies. the chief 
complaint seems to be about them wondering around in groups doing what ever 
they please and going where they want to go. Socially acceptable as long as 
you're too old to have much fun anymore, and your tour vehicle is at least 40 
feet long with more amenities than I have in my house. Wake up folks, just 
because something's different doesn't make it bad.
