 As a quick reference of how myuch grease 80 grams is, i'll refer to the
 grease packets included with the Lobro CV boot kits.  80 grams.  (though
 the Bentley for 68-84 buses says to use 90 grams...) &gt;&gt;

when correctly using the complete amount of grease you will have barely any 
left over to pack the c.v. joint boot.  the amount left will be the 
equivalent of having enough to smear a light coating in the inside of the 
boot.  the packing of the boot is even more incorrect.  i challenge anyone to 
completely dis-assembleboth sides of the axles and pack one onlky packing the 
c.v.  the other side completely pack the boot and the bearing. i hve $100 
that says the boot will explode in less than 3k miles, while the other will 
continue to operate normally.  ihave tried it on numerous busses under varied 
circumstances.  all results were identical.  

this is a touchy subject to those who have been packing things as tight as 
possible.  everyone does it their own way.

have fun
