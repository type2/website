Subject: Re: [T2] Doormobile, Rivera ?

Unfortunately the webmaster does not routinely scan the type2 list, only 
the vintagebus one (Matt, you need to learn to dig the fat chicks!). 
Please get with Matt Roberds, address in the header.

We applaud this sort of thing, and listees please bear in mind that that 
we *always* have space for the results of bus research projects of all 
sorts (well, please try not to flagrantly violate copyright laws, but 
other than that...). Seems like there used to be more people willing to 
do these things than there are now. You have a tremendous amount of disk 
space, bandwidth, and server resources available, and y'all are paying 
for it, best to use it!

&gt; put on a link so we can see what the various configurations look like?.
&gt; I'm sure I've seen a lot of Westy type units but it certainly is
&gt; confusing. I know some are very rare and  I see many list members with
&gt; nonstandard conversions that were special ordered or modified.
&gt; A picture gallery of side mount accessory tents would also be nice.
&gt; A home page link could accomplish this task nicely and serve to educate
&gt; us type confused list members.

terrifies me. We must have more freedom now, not less. Liberty entails 
risks, but its contraries ensure disaster.
