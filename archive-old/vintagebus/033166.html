&lt;&lt; I'd suggest double-checking that the gear on the starter is the right one 
for the flywheel you've got (did the teeth on your rebuilt starter get chewed 
up?), and getting your money back for the bad starter.  Then, buy a new one, 
and go from there. &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
Not sure if this was mentioned earlier.  You need to make sure the starter 
bushing pressed in the tranny bellhousing is not worn out and correct for the 
voltage type of starter used.  Unless of course one is using a self 
supprorting starter.  Eric&amp;Barb
