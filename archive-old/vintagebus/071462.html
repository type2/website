&gt; I believe that if my parents could have, they CERTAINLY would have, used a
&gt; TV or ANYTHING, that would have kept me from pestering my siblings.

Same here. You could put this arguement on different things. My parents
never had travel board games when they were kids, but we did. My
grandparents didn't have heat and air conditioning, but my parents did.

How's that line go?
