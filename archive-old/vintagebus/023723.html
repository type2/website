With everybody so quick to jump on someone who has not done a good job,
I'd like to be a little bit different and draw attention to someone who
did a GREAT job.

I just received a container of Double Cab Bed Slats today for my '60
double cab from list member, Robert Davis.  His workmanship is
exceptional and the slats look great.  My neighbor who also has a DC was
a bit hesitant to get in on Robert's inital offering saw them today and
agrees with my opinion of the slats.  The only down side is that now I
have to wait until I get paint on the bed to install them.

Great job, Robert!
