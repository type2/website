Subject: Battery corrosion?

I know this was just on the list but could someone explain it to me again.
My friend is having problems with his battery severly corroding to where
he has to clean it off every week to get the bike to even start. I
believe it's a new battery but doesn't the changing weather have
something to do with it and proper ground. Please let me know
Thanks in advance
