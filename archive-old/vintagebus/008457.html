I'm paranoid about being under a bus as well.  Not so much bugs but just
anything bigger than a bug despite the fact that a bus can crush and kill
you anyway - go figure.  I always (when possible) leave the jack under the
vehicle with just a slight amount of pressure on the vehicle (enough to keep
the jack from rolling away), use a couple of jack stands, wheel chocks, and
most importantly, a stack of 2 tires (with rims) or more in a place under
the vehicle so in case of a tip over, stand failure, jack blowout, there
will be something left to hold it up.  I also slam my rear into the body and
try to knock the vehicle off the stands by pushing on it so that I know it
isn't going anywhere.  Call it insurance...
