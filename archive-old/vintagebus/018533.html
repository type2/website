&gt; &gt; I'm with George on this one. Why not ditch all the
&gt; &gt; Type 3's and go with all buses, bugs, things, and
&gt; Type

&gt; 
&gt; Woah!  I didn't say that!  My dividing line was the
&gt; change from rear
&gt; engine/rear drive toi front engine/front drive! 
&gt; Type 3's are vintage VWs
&gt; from a mechanical standpoint.
