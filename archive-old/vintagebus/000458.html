 So is there any bonifide way to rid the bus of this smell?  Anyone had
 experience with getting this stench out of an old vehicle?
 I'm wondering if there isn't some kind of fumigation or perfume that I can
 use to totally saturate the innards?  Even the smell of gasoline would be
 better than smelling mouse piss.  Any suggestions from the Martha Stewart's
 and Heloise's amongst us?

I would try going to a pet store and getting that stuff that they sell for 
getting cat pee smell out of carpets.  forget what model your 66 is, but if 
it has panels the smell could be in them.  The 54 kombi i had a couple years 
ago smelled pretty mousy for a while, had been sitting on a farm for 20 
years, we pulled everything (not much) out and hosed it out and scrubbed it 
down with dish soap and a scrubbrush and it was fine, the only problem was 
the seats, they smelled, but sitting them in the sun for a week helped.
