The outside temperature had dropped to the high 20s but at least the 
wind had calmed down. The ride in was tough with cross winds gusting 
to twenty on the open road. I was not really looking forward to the 
drive back but I wanted to wake up in my own bed.

Michele helped me pack the bus with boxes and bags of opened gifts 
from the two Christmas celebrations we had attended that day. I was 
glad for the help and the company because I would not see her or 
Stella for a week. The last thing loaded in the bus was Frank, our 18 
month old son. Frank was worn out from a day of cousins, aunts, 
uncles and grandparents and I expected him to doze off before the bus 
even warmed up.

This final leg of driving would put the bus over the 500 mile mark 
for the weekend. Earlier in the day after the 120 mile run to 
Michele's sisters I snuck out for a smoke and took a look at the 
errant 34 PICT carb. The throttle had been sticking on and off for 
the past few hundred miles. I made a few adjustments but would not 
get a chance to road test the bus until it was time to head to the 
next family event an hour or two later.

It had been a wonderful Christmas but I could not shake the feeling 
of sadness over not seeing my wife and daughter for the next 5 days. 
We joke about not getting a minute to ourselves or about driving each 
other nuts but when it comes down to it we like to be together.

Turn the key and the motor roars to life. Turn on the headlights to 
fight the darkness and hope they don't get freaky again. Reach back 
and double check Frank's car seat. Slow roll down the long driveway. 
I could close my eyes and see the ice forming on the carb. It was a 
long drive through the neighborhood until we reached US 64. There 
would be a few odd stoplights in Cary but that would be it for a 
while. The bus ran well as it warmed up and we settled in a 55 MPH.

For the first ten miles I listened to the motor and waited for the 
heat to arrive. Usually after the final Christmas gig with the 
in-laws Michele and I debrief  while the kids sleep. I always look 
forward to that but this time the only chatter was from the tired out 
old 1600. I should have done the valves but it was 15 degrees out 
that morning and after futzing with the carb and noting that I had 
just done the valves about 1000 miles ago I let it slide.

My mind wandered. What spare parts did I have? Tools? I did an 
inventory to pass the time, I reasoned that if need be I had enough 
stuff to pull the motor on the side of the road. I though about the 
logistics of doing this in 15 degree temps, darkness, side of the 
highway. Why? I hope it does not come to that......time to turn on 
the radio. Louis Armstrong doing some X-mas jazz. That was nice. The 
signal was not good and some presents were covering one of the 
speakers but it was better than the noise coming from my head.

Suddenly it was cold. Last bump jarred some packages from the rear 
seat onto the floor. The rear heat tube was blocked. Out of propane 
too. Pulled over at a gas station in just outside of Jordan Lake. 
Rearranged packages, swap gas cylinders. Suddenly it was dark. What 
the hell happened!? Damn headlights. No, wait. The station was 
closing early because it was Christmas night and they turned off the 
all the lights leaving me in a now darkened parking lot. I don't know 
why that was such a shock. Too much coffee and driving. Feeling edgy.

Back on the road. Cross over Jordan lake and prepare to enter the 
consruction zone. The bypass around Pittsboro in not complete yet. 
Even when it is done I will probably not use it. Pittsboro is a small 
town to the south of Chapel Hill. Its claim to fame for me at least 
it the Pittsboro traffic circle.  US 64 and NC 87 intersect in the 
middle of town. Where the roads should cross is an old courthouse 
with a traffic circle around it. Look kids Parliament Look kids Big 
Ben. Look kids Parliament . Look Kids . Big Ben. I don't think it 
would be good to bypass that sort of fun.

As I exited the circle Louis was blowing a sad song. I was focused on 
driving. On getting us home. Safe and warm. Wondering if the dog had 
gone nuts in our absence and taken it out on the Xmas tree. 
BBBBEEEEEPPP. What the. ?????????

In the oncoming lane, covered in white Xmas lights was a split screen 
bus. Odd sight in this locale. I was so happy and stunned to see 
another bus driver that I had to do a double take. Who was it? The 
bus was white or light gray.I leaned on the horn as we passed and 
waved. I honestly could not tell if it was a panel van or a single 
cab with a cut down tilt and bows. Behind the cab it was covered in 
lights and looked almost ghostly? Was it really even there. Reminded 
of the creepy scene in the old black and white version of A Christmas 
Carol where the ghost sleigh drawn by ghost horses taunts Scrooge.

Back to the 4 lane. Line of angry motorists finally breezes by in the 
darkness. I was as relieved to be rid of them as they were to be rid 
of me.

Siler City, pick up US 421 head  NW . Coming down the ramp I turned 
on the high beams.  Click, no low still hi.. Sh*t, now I will be 
cursed by oncoming motorists as well. Click. Still stuck on High. 
Click, no headlights. Click, high beams again. Relay frozen? Better 
to be stuck on Hi then driving in the dark. Kick the lever to 
redirect heat to foot well. Wonder if heat rising off the back of the 
vent will warm the relay. Click, ckick, click, hi, dark , hi, Stick 
with hi-beams. Dont want to attract attention of local law 
enforcement. Nothing to hide just dont need the hassle.  5 miles 
pass. Click. Low beans. Relax. Stay away from the turn signal arm for 
the rest of the trip.

Approaching home. Enter the city through an area that has long since 
lost it luster. So cold the hookers and drug dealers are not even on 
the streets. Maybe the have Xmas off too.

Downtown is beautifully lit. Sitting at a stoplight in the middle 
downtown. Idle down to 850. No other cars around. Faintly hear Frank 
snore.

Safely arrive home.
