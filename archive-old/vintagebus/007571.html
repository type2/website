&gt; As was pointed out to me recently, the little bulbs in the headlight
buckets are only supposed to be on when the headlight switch is pulled out
to the first click.  When the headlights are on (second click) these lights
are off.
&gt;
FYI, I'm pretty sure this is not true of the earlier Buses (50s?), although
I'm not sure when the change was made.
