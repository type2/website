&gt;Another thing I've noticed is that alot of buses with og black or og
&gt;yellow plates have &quot;commercial&quot; truck plate number sequences.

Here in Oklahoma, until a couple of years ago, commercial registrations
were hundreds of dollars cheaper than passenger-car registrations.  The
standards of being &quot;commercial&quot; were not very high, so just about every
Joe Smith with a truck registered it to &quot;The Joe Smith Co.&quot; and got
commercial tags.  The colors were the same, but the number sequence was
different.  They also required a &quot;Commercial Vehicle&quot; sticker.  The fees
were finally lowered, and the standards for being &quot;commercial&quot; raised,
so this is nowhere near as common as it once was.

Another popular way to dodge the fees was to get a tribal tag, but you
had to know someone that was qualified in order to do that.
