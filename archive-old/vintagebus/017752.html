Shawn is overjoyed with his VW bus...

I especially enjoy the healing powers of
checking/topping off the tranny fluid level and having
the tranny fluid jizz down the length of my sweaty arm
into my armpit when I accidentally drop the plug into
my new glasses as I lay under the bus with a weak
flashlight resulting in banging my head on the
crossmember and then laying my hair into the pool of
jizz on the driveway... as the portable telephone
rings at the same time.

Getting ready for Jerome at the last minute is always
fun. See all of me favorite retrobates there! =)
