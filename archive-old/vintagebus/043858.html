hi all,

Wanted to put my 2p in on this one.

Basically when both are running well a splitty is no more or less
driveable than a vanagon, the vanagon will be like thom said comfier and
with more creature comforts. the split is a litte more cramped in the
driver seat &amp; generally a noisy ride, but for me it has more farfagnugen
(sp?).

The big difference is in maintenance.  You are unlikely to find a split
that doesnt have a lot of worn out parts that need to be replaced to make
it reliable. They are all quite old. Once those parts are replaced, no
worries. A vanagon is less likely to need major components replaced due to
age/wear.

Basically, popular opinion is this, the engines in vanagons (t4) last
Much longer and cost 4x the money to fix, but the engines in splitties
need more maintenance.

Personally, i prefer the splitties because I do my own work. they are
easier to work on, parts are cheaper, and they are so
low-geared lightweight and small they go off roading great.  If i had a
friend that would be taking their car to a mechanic, I wouldn't hesitate
to sell them a split, if i *knew* it was low mileage or had all systems
checked out, but i think i'd probably steer them to a vanagon or late bus
to start with all things considered... then after they got their feet wet
they could move to a split if they wanted.

Also, many splittie parts have to be found through knowing where good
junkyards are and networking with friends, bay and vgon parts are much
easier to find.

take care,

Steve

P.S. for example, my split needed all new brakes, bearings, a front beam a
transaxle new engine, new alternator, new carburator, wiring etc. before I
felt it was roadworthy. If I had to pay someone to do all that and
troubleshoot the minor problems that resulted (tranny leak due to loose 
sidecover etc.) I'd be beyond broke, but doing it myself was no big deal
to me, woudl it be to you?
