Subject: caution tampa fla. vw owners!!!

hey all, im not accusing anyone of anything, just saying, use caution when you take your vw to a place in tampa called south florida auto repair. my friend had his vw repaired there, and the mechanic who did it, didnt do it right. be careful when you take your vw to an auto shop, make them double check everything.
