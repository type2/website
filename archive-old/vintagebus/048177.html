Hi Bob,
Do your brake stars have thier friction leaf spring tightly against each 
star?  If broken off or bent away from the star/s will allow the stars to 
back off.  Also how are you using the brakes will affect how fast your shoes 
wear.  Dragging brakes all the way downhill is not good and niether is power 
diving at top of the speed limit toward red traffic lights and at the last 
second hitting the brakes.    

&lt;&lt;if i pump them twice when i need to stop, they really grab, so i know they 
are backing off. i took the drums off and the shoes arent that bad. i dont 
get it.&gt;&gt;
When you pump twice does the pedal come up much more than 1/2&quot;?  If so it 
could be air in the system needs to be bled out.  Pumping once or twice 
should be the same braking power unless there is air in there.    Eric&amp;Barb
