Hi,

I purchased a 2/3 length metal roof rack(VWoA style) from another listmember
last month. He had sanded, primed and applied some silver paint. It looked
great but he warned me that he was under the impression that the paint may
not have adhered well. The rack has been on the bus for about a month now
and some surface rust has rapidly appeared. I am not surprised or upset but
I do wish to take quick action. The bus lives outside and the roofrack is
keeping it company.

This is not something I know a lot about and I am sure there are many
approaches. The quick and dirty would seem to be sandpaper and some silver
rattle can paint. A little more involved would be visiting a friend with a
sandblaster and taking it down to bare metal. That would be followed by an
application of either more rattle can paint of maybe some POR15 carefully
brushed on. I can also get access to a paint gun but have never used one and
am unsure of what would be the best to use for paint. The extreme would be
having in media blasted and powdercoated but this might be getting out of my
price range.

Just thinking out loud. Feel free to think back:)

Chris
