&lt;&lt; I'm wondering if any of you might know what this part is. Found it 
attached to the fuel pump on a 40hp motor. My best guess is a pressure 
regulator of some sort (but iv never heard of a stock fuel pump having too 
much pressure) &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
We somehow missed this Email, but it sounds like a one way shut off valve.  
Found out about this from our VW microfiche years ago.   Eric&amp;Barb
