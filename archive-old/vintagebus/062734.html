Subject: Re: My first _at_Bay rip off! :-)

i bought a &quot;NOS&quot; 356 fog light switch from someone on eBay. got it and it 
was OBVIOUSLY a repro, i sent a reply and didnt hear from the guy in 5 days 
so i left negative feedback, his first one. oh my god was he pissed, he 
called me every name he could possible type, oh well!... he should have been 
honest!! i told him this would teach him a lesson for the future about 
describing new junk as &quot;NOS&quot;.
