Subject: axle boot doesn't fit

Hello all,

I went to install new axle boots last night and found that they were too tight
where they fit around the axle tube retainer flange. Even when I torqued the
clamp as tight as it would go, there was still a gap at the seam.

After reading the fine print in the shop manual, I discovered that there are
two different sizes available to fit the two different size flanges. The
earlier plates are 85mm o.d., and the new ones are 89mm o.d.. That certainly
corresponds to the size of the gap.

Here are the different models of boot:
111 598 021A and 111 598 021B

I have the later size flange so, according to the manual I need the &quot;B&quot; style.
Problem is I can't find them anywhere. Does anyone have a line on these?

If you have a chassis number from 738 501and up, you have to know what I'm
talking about if you've ever replaced your boots. The &quot;A's&quot; just don't fit.

Where can I get the &quot;B's&quot;? And don't say &quot;the hive&quot;.

Thanks as always,
Rocco
