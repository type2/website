&gt; I have a 65 camper.
&gt; I have 2 requests for information:
&gt; First, the drivers portion has a &quot;double track&quot; system to hang
&gt; curtains.  Where could I buy the curtains and the attachments which
&gt; would fit into the double track system.

 You can get the little plastic thingies that slide in the track you
speak of at any decent RV supply store. You then have to sew them by
hand onto your curtains. The actual tracks are also available, but they
are slightly different in appearance from those usually used way back
when by vw camper conversion companies. But if it for utilitarian
purposes, they are great. PLF Dawn has them occasionally also, so maybe
check her if they are not available locally in your area.

&gt; Second, I just bought a used VW tent, 

&gt; Any suggestions on where to find instructions on how it attaches?

What is Joe Clark's &quot;VW Canvas on the net&quot; URL? I tried my bookmark link
ad it is broken. This is the place to see hwo vw tents are supposed to
work. Or you could just send it to me and I will figure it out for you
and send a picture. :)
