Subject: Best cars I cut up !
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Another Friday feature !

in the early 70s there was a Barndoor camper 1952-53. 
It had a small opening rear hatch. We always saw it around town when we were 
cruising the dumped barndoor panel.

One day the guy calls us and asks if we want to buy it , well he had just ate 
a phone pole with it, right in the center of the nose ! 
 So we bought it and chopped it up, cut the rear window section, the front 
overhang air scoop and a few other parts and threw the rest of the body 
away..........

oh well

PS.....anyone have a dark green 54 panel (dumped) with cut wheelwells in Los 
Angeles

PSS.....Anyone ever salvage the 56 Rometsch coupe that was outside the Auto 
parts store in Oceanside in the early 70s ? It was sitting on the ground with 
no chassis !!!
