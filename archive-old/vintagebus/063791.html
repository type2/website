Subject: Here the h*ll is it . . .

Volks,

A while back, last winter or early spring, I &quot;ran&quot; into a nice site that =
spelled out how to install front door seals per the original diagonal cuts =
and trims.  Man, I hit the print button quick smart.  Now I can't find the =
two sheets of paper for the life of me, and I can't find the site surfing =
for it. =20

It included overall &quot;big picture&quot; graphics and a couple of closeups for =
the angle trims etc. =20

Where, where, where?  It is Friday and the Luvly tells me I have to finish =
the roof over the patio . . . so we can store stuff tarped under it, and I =
can then put My Sweet Bus in the garage for the winter. . . .
