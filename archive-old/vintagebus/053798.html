&lt;&lt;  The truth is that the Volkswagen

name is out of date, what with its 1930's lumpenproletariat overtones.  VW

would do much better just to let everyone use their present trademarks and

pick a new name, more in touch with their present corporate identity, and

which no one else would want to use.


How about, say, Philip Morris?  Its present owner doesn't want the name

anymore, it has built-in brand recognition, and nobody else will want to use

it.  And best of all, it fits their new corporate style.

 &gt;&gt;

In keeping with the truth in advertising laws; how about &quot;Tatra&quot;? Auto-
motive history buffs will recognize the new/old corporate style ;-(
