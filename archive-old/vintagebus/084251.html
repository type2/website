Subject: Re: [VB] I need some valuable input...?

Hi All -

&quot;I have recently purchased a new $4200 SCAT turnkey motor and it has been
nothing but trouble and headache ever since. ...&quot;

No, everyone has it wrong, jumping to quasi-legal advice.  First things first. 
  All the tuneup and missing/wrong parts issues only prove that they probably 
never started it up - or only the single 2,000 rpm breakin.  They shipped a 
product more or less as their ads state - such and such pieces (the mention of 
50W oil is more than passing strange though.  20W should be more like it for 
breakin).  Yes $4,200 bought a bunch of stuff bolted together.

All these things done wrong and the time and money spent to make it right 
could be written off as a needless and useless extra cost needed to make a 
mail order motor perform properly - all the things that a competent local 
builder would include correctly (or the owner builder would do for himself). 
Proof that buying an image of a product is inherently troublesome.  And it 
opens up the discussion to such issues as: Was it balanced, and if so what 
parts and how - what other shortcuts did they take that aren't visible - did 
they install a problem ?

Bringing us to the crux.  Though missing, there is apparently some form of 
warranty.  Ok, what is it?

&quot;BIGGEST Problem:   A low sounding vibration coming in at the lower/beginning
RPM range.  A strong vibration that is obviously not right.
Fix:  Replaced with newly rebuilt transmission, mounts, all shift
rod bushings, throw bearing, berg shifter etc., adjusted and re-adjusted
clutch
Result:  Absolutely nothing.  Still Vibrating strongly.(almost
like a lugging, but does it in neutral as well. With clutch pressure, it
increases the vibrating though&quot;

Before taking the motor apart to find the cause of the vibration, take it out 
of the bus, measure the endplay, check for a spun bearing, turn it over by 
hand to see if any detectable clues.  In the end only the facts will help you 
prevail.  Once armed with more information I believe you need to talk to a 
fresh voice at SCAT in a bid to resolve the issue without legal overhead. 
Ronnie of OldVolks fame says he talks directly to the big cheese at SCAT - see 
if he can't give you a contact there.  He'll likely have some useful advice as 
well.

Nick
