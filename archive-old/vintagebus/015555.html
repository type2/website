Subject: jets in a 28PCI

So I got to looking at a 28PCI carb, and there look to be four jets.
I always thought there were two: the idle jet, and the main jet.  The
jet-like things I'm seeing are (FIF):

- on the exterior left side, just behind the base of the float bowl, a
  13mm bolt head attached to a short tube with numbers stamped into
  the end away from the bolt head
- on the exterior right side, just below the parting line for the
  top of the carb, just behind the float bowl, a flat screw-like
  object with numbers stamped into the screw head
- suspended in the middle of the throat, a largish flat screw-like
  object with numbers stamped into the screw head
- using the previous one as the center of a clock, and the front of
  the carb being 12 o'clock, on the side of the throat at about 1:30 a
  smallish flat screw-like object with numbers stamped into the screw
  head

I'd always thought that the first one above was the main jet, and the
second was the idle jet.  Yes/no?  What are the two in the throat?

Thanks.
