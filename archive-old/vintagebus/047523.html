Hi Ronnie,
Could be....  It could also be for a air conditioner or a frige system or 
some type of supercharger.

&lt;&lt; Also the cylinder tin has humps on it with the cylinder markings on them 1 
2 3 4 are stamped on raised humps, &gt;&gt;
Those are for the Bastard 40HP engine from later half of 59 through 60.
Are you interested in selling/trading either or both of these items?
