I do believe Wolfgang makes some though I dont think the quality is great but 
that is NOT thru personal experience, only based upon what friends have said. 
 Dave Palmer from Creative Engineering also makes some but I have yet to see 
the quality.  Personally if they aren't that far gone I would rather have 
them blasted and such.

Anybody seen those CE pop-outs yet?  I would really like to hear the details.
