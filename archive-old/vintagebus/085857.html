Subject: Exhaust Leak

I agree.  If you can touch it with impunity after the
engine has been running it probably isn't the exhaust
but the intake manifold.  A temporary fix for an
intake manifold &quot;hole&quot; is metal tape.  My luck with
welding or brazing intake leaks has been pretty bad. 
Usually if there is one hole already there are a lot
of them just waiting for enough heat to pop through. 
You can buy new single intake manifolds and even
though they don't fit easily but they can be made to
work.  I have one on my Ghia.

&gt; its the intake manifold that has the hole in it?
