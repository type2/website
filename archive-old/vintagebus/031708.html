Subject: BUS SHEET METAL
Date: Sat, 28 Apr 2001 09:31:49 -0700

   What do people think are the most desirable sheet metal pieces needed for
a bus. I am trying to get a list in priority of what is needed. There is a U
S manufacturer who I have been in contact with for a few years now, that is
ready to step up to the plate and start stamping bus metal. There goal is to
have 3 or 4 parts made by the Classic weekend to show (display). They have a
very fast production time due to new state of the art laser tracers and die
cutters and can have parts made in about a weeks time. I am sending them R/L
rockers and associated pieces and am also sending them a dog leg (early).
They already have a NOS front floor but I did not ask which year. In a
discussion I had with them they were talking of doing cargo floors also. Due
to a major recession in the auto industry back East they now have the time
to make other parts, basically anything to avoid shutting the plant down and
putting people out of jobs.

ps. please respond to the list or P-mail, if you have any NOS (body) parts
