&gt; I bought both the Rooster productions video, &quot;How to rebuild you VW 
&gt; engine&quot;,
&gt; and the Bug Me series &quot;Rebuilding your VW engine&quot; for my oldest son. 
&gt; Both
&gt; are good in their own way, but the Rooster productions video had a 
&gt; slick
&gt; never fail method of installing your distributor drive gear and 
&gt; spacers and
&gt; setting static timing that beats all other methods. I would 
&gt; recommend either
&gt; to a first timer.
