Subject: CB Performance/Kymco/40IDF's

Both of my 40IDF's kits have now arrived.  The one is the $130 setup from CB
Performance with the new venturis and overhead vaporizing fuel rail.  This
kit also contains new gaskets, orings, and sealing washers of some sort but
no full blown rebuild kit.  The $80+ package from Kymco is a bunch of custom
ordered jets which Ronnie suggested for my personal setup as well as 2 full
blown rebuild kits.

Ronnie at Kymco asked me a bunch of questions about my cam, heads,
displacement, etc. and he told me what would be the best set of jets to run
on these carbs.  CB Performance didn't want to know - you just call and
order and their kit comes with everything.  So I'm going to compare Ronnie
of Kymco's jets to CB's.  I'm curious if CB's kit is a generic/across the
board type of kit or if there is something about the fuel rail that
necessitates using what they supply.

As I posted over a week ago, this is what the book says I need for my
engine:

40IDF Jetting Guide Dual Carb
1600cc to 1835cc

Venturi = 28mm (mine is labeled 28)
Main Gas = 140 (mine says 115)
Main Air Correction = 210 (mine says 170)
Emulsion Tube = f11 (mine says f11)
Idle = 55 (mine says 50)
===
CB's Kit contains the following jets:

1 set of 4 jets are stamped MCI .60

The second set of 4 is stamped MCI 1.80
===
Kymco's package contains:

Set of 4 jets labeled at IDF 180A

Another set of 4 jets (totally unlike any of the other in physical size)
labeled IDF55I

So it looks to me like both sets are really similar in design.  I think I'll
just run the jets that Ronnie suggested in conjunction with CB's kit.  I can
always swap if I need to.  I felt really good about the reasons Ronnie gave
me for why I needed said jets.  A lot had to do with the reduced flow at
higher RPM's because of using stock heads.  Should I ever upgrade my heads,
then a larger jet is required somewhere/someplace.

More later...
