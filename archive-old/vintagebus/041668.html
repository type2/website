Never discount the abilities of the aged.  Perhaps he will have a helper
or two come out of the woodwork when needed, or perhaps the feel of the
crane controls will have a rejuvinating effect!

George, who in a few weeks is going out to Eastern Nevada to help his
88-year-young Dad with communications for the Pony Express reenactment.
Dad will drive his 'ol Ch*vy van 350 miles, set up a ham radio station
including a 30 foot tower, sleep under the stars, work the event, and
then reverse the steps.  Lotsa fun!
