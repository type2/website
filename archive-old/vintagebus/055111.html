No, the bus Greg got was another one that was for sale, I kick myself in the
ass for not buying it when I saw it for sale.

I would *guess* that the bus Greg got IS the bus that Rich had. Rich was
trying to sell it to get going on a house last I heard. Greg, is that the
one you have? It's a cool bus!
