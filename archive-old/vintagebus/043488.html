&gt;In the meantime I have to find out a way to weasel the answer out of 
&gt;Arnold without making him think that 1. He's a lunatic for asking 3K
&gt;(which he would be). or 2.  Encouraging him to step up to 3K if he's
&gt;only got 300 in mind...

This would have worked better when standing there, but &quot;jokingly&quot;
saying something like &quot;Three dollars?  Heck, I'll give you five
dollars for it!&quot; might elicit a laugh and an order-of-magnitude
qualification.  Or, say something like &quot;How about 250?&quot; If he
has $3000 in mind you can tell by the reaction.  If he was
thinking $300 then you saved a little money.  If he was thinking
$3 then you still saved fifty cents.  :)

Good luck!
