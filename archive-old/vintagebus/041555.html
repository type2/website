written by kabayo:
Oil should certainly reach 220-230 when your engine in warmed up, minimum,
or else the moisture won't get boiled out.  Look for that scummy whitish
stuff in your oil cap if you make a lot of short trips w/out getting the
engine hot.:

220-230 is a fine operating temperature for average conditions but by no
means would I call this a minimum.
I do agree that daves temps are low. he always neglets to mention that
there is an ext cooler on there.
