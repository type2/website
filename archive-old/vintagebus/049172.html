Here's a quick update for those who are interested and those who are bored.

Finally finished all of my interior wood panels on the SO-23 '59 Westfalia.  Here's a short blow by blow for those considering remaking their panels in the future.  I first cut the panels to the correct height and width.  I did this by tracing the old panels on the BACK of each new panel.  I clamped down a guide board and made the cuts with a small skill saw from the back side.  I did this as the blade on a skill saw cuts from the bottom up, so doing it this way minimized splintering.  I set the saw blade about a 1/16&quot; deeper than the thickness of the panels and just cut into the particle board I was using as a table top.  These cuts came out perfect, zero splinters, even on the cross grain cuts.

I then flipped them all over and retraced the panels on the FRONT side, which were only the curved cuts (the portion that goes over the wheelwells, the bottom corners on the cargo door panel and the lock box cut outs on the cargo door and rear hatch panel, as well as the tiny radiused corners on the flip hatch panel.  Once drawn, I ever-so-carefully cut along the lines with a #11 x-acto knife.  I went very lightly the first cut, then a little deeper with each cut.  I probably made 5 to 6 cuts to insure that I was thru the veneer and into the backing.  I then took a jigsaw with a finish blade and downward teeth, and cut along the line or just to the outside of the line.  Any backing left I removed with the x-acto knife, then sanded smooth.  Let's just say the panels came out as close to perfect as I care about.  I was really happy with the results.

Then on to staining.  After many tests with numerous stains it turned out the almost identical match was Minwax Colonial Maple.  The combo of this stain with my type of panelling was dead on, as I wanted the panels to match the aged cabinets, not just simply doing it the way it was done originally.  I applied two coats, letting each sit on the wood for about 15 minutes, wiped off the excess, 5 hours inbetween coats.  Then 3 coats of exterior satin Varathane.  They look bitchin!!!

As for the floor, I decided to just apply the Varathane with no stain as original Westy floors are always a lot more *blonde* since they never see the light of day.  So to keep it as *original* looking as possible I just put the clearcoat on the floor.

During all of this drying time I attacked the rearmost cargo door panel, the one with the wihite formica.  It was in great shape, but these panels are approx. 4 layers of backing, veneer, and formica.  Over time with leaking doors and windows the layers had separated, primarily along the door opening side and the bottom.  I carefully applied woodworking glue inbetween all of the layers and as deep inside as it would go.  After wiping off all the excess, I tightly sandwiched everything together using the blue painters tape.  It should be ready to de-tape tonight.

Next, installing the panels, which should begin in the next day or two.  I really want to go slow on this step and use the existing holes.  More to follow.....................
