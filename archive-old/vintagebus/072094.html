&lt;&lt; Want to get an oil pump with filter and have a universal H case, question 
 being, does it have a flat cam or dished (I assume dished)?&gt;&gt;

depends whether they put a flat or dished in there the last time it was taken 
apart.   I guess you gotta pull the oil pump and check, to know for sure.`

ps didn't think they made H cases universal.
