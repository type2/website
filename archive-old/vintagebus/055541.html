Subject: Westfalia turns 50 and pics from Germany trip.

Westfalia is celebrating their 50th anniversary this year.  They had on 
display their first Westy conversion, a 1950 VW Bus, which was converted in 
1951.  I don't know how authentic it is. 

I also posted some pics of my trip to Germany in August.  Lots of cool 
campers at the Camping Salon in Dusseldorf and a few pics of Autostadt in 
Wolfsburg.  Or at least as many pics I took until I got bored of taking them 
and stopped.
