Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Attn. all shoppers, black plate special on aisle 63

Don't forget boys and girls that to be correct for your pre '63
&quot;commercial&quot; vehicle ie: bus, you want the black on yellow plates with 6
digits spaced like this:   A  ##  ### .  The other type  like:  AAA  ###   
are for cars.

&gt;  Todd,
&gt; Your plates are black letters on plates. These are the last series of
plates
&gt; you can use as YOM plates.
&gt; These ended in 62.
&gt; Starting in 63, the plates were black with yellow letters. And the order
&gt; reversed. Yellow w/black letters were number/letter, i.e. 123 ABC. Black
&gt; w/yellow letters were letter/number, i.e. ABC 123.
&gt; You cannot use a black w/yellow plate on a 63 and up unless you can prove
they
&gt; are the correct original plates from when the vehicle was 1st registered.
