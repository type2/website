Hey everyone,
I'm game with setting up a meeting place before and during the show. I have a 
10x10 canopy that can be set-up with a banner or something so everyone can 
see it and use that as a spot. Also, it's hard to miss my bright turquoise 
and white hardtop deluxe.

Let me know what everyone thinks,
Dave Barnes
