    I would like to publically thank Bob Hoover for what his sermons have done
for me.  I carefully read any that I felt might be of interest or aid which
soon meant that I had covered every one.  The Sermons helped me make many
important decisions as I prepared my Volkswagens for roadworthiness and also
helped me to help another.  A poorer gentleman that lives not far from me has
an &quot;under the weather&quot; 67 walkthru kombi that was his favorite ride for many
past years but the master cylinder went up and he couldn't afford to get the
67 only part.  He drove it into his backyard and let it sit.  I gave him the
info that Bob had made available on the topic and the next thing you know the
guy was cruising again, dual circuit and all!  It seems to me that Bob loves
to share his knowledge with those who know how to respect it.  Bob Hoover is a
very generous man who went through an untold hell to keep his sermons
available to us for so long.  I do not condemn him in any way for removing
them from the &quot;public eye&quot; but I am grateful that I had the chance that he
gave us all.  Thanks Bob.

Dan Morris, 19 and learning.
