Subject: Re: [VB] woman driver - bbb7 trip report

[...]

Agreed! I just drove from Los Angeles to Plantation Florida last week,
without a hitch. I do long trips all the time over the  years. If one
maintains a bus, and knows the condition of one's engine, one can drive it
anywhere on a moments notice.  Been doing it for 29 years now!

regards, cal

&gt; I'll bet that it has more to do with driving a well-maintained bus!  :)

&gt; Just about every VW that I've stopped to help has been a maintainance
&gt; nightmare.  No engine seals, missing tin, missing heater tubes, rats-nest
&gt; wiring, etc.  I wouldn't leave the driveway with them, let along take
&gt; them hundreds of miles across the desert!
