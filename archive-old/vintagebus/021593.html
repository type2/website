i think originally all the campers migrated to florida for the winter,  jb

Based on the number of campers here in FL, I think you may be right.  At 
least 20-30 on the road in St Augustine alone.  Most are beaters like mine 
but they still run and they always start in February.  My Louvres whistle 
with the wind when I go cruising.  The dogs love it!
