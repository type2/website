I saved this message from last year because I thought I'd go to Target and
check it out.   I never did get around to it but still had the message.  HTH

&gt; I'm posting this to the List as a whole because I've received so many
&gt; individual inquiries.
&gt;
&gt; The bike rack I found at Target a few years ago is called:
&gt;
&gt; CONCORD III
&gt; Premium 3-Bike Carrier System
&gt;
&gt; I bought it at TARGET, a national department store chain.  TARGET is not a
&gt; membership store.  As I recall I paid around $35.00 to $40.00 for the
rack.
&gt;
&gt; The box copy says &quot;Fits virtually all vehicles (including Mini Vans,
Wagons,
&gt; 4x4s and RVs).&quot;   When used on a sedan it allows access to the trunk.  It
also
&gt; claims a &quot;Unique new design...&quot;, and with that I agree.
&gt;
&gt; I'm no good at ASCII art, so I'll attempt to describe the design...
&gt;
&gt; The weight of the rack and it's cargo is borne almost entirely by the
&gt; vehicle's bumper.  very stout straps with coated hooks attach to the rain
&gt; gutter, front trunk edge, or some other suitable metal body part above or
&gt; forward of the rack, depending on the vehicle.  Similar straps with coated
&gt; hooks attach to the vehicle tow hooks, body, or bumper below/under the
bumper.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The rack (which is built from round steel tubing) is a rectangular closed
loop
&gt; when viewed from the rear.  From the side the loop is shaped rather like a
&gt; shallow letter &quot;L&quot;.  The base of the &quot;L&quot; is heavily padded with thick
neoprene
&gt; foam.  This is the only portion of the rack itself that is actually in
contact
&gt; with the vehicle.
&gt;
&gt; The rack is installed by resting the base on top of the bumper with the
top
&gt; (on a van) straps hanging loosely from the rain gutter or hatch top edge.
The
&gt; lower straps are hooked to the frame, tow hooks, etc. and tightened with
&gt; cam-lock buckles.  The aim is to have the upright portion of the rack
angled
&gt; back around 20 degrees with the top straps tight and the bottom straps
very
&gt; tight.  The final step is to draw the upright portion back to vertical by
&gt; further tightening the upper/forward straps.  The design incorporates
special
&gt; protective pads so the lower straps won't mark or chafe the bumper.
&gt;
&gt; This may sound cumbersome and complex, but in practice installation on the
&gt; back of my Campmobile takes about a minute.  When installed on the front
of my
&gt; van, the upper/forward (now actually &quot;rearward&quot;) straps are anchored to
the
&gt; front-mounted spare tire carrier.
&gt;
&gt; The bike support arms are attached near the top of the carrier frame.
They
&gt; have a wide range of angle adjustment, in small increments, and the
locking
&gt; assembly is really stout.  The arms have an upturn at the ends for
increased
&gt; security.  They include custom-sized bungee cords to lash the bikes to the
&gt; rack.
&gt;
&gt; This rack folds flat for storage, and can be broken down further if space
is
&gt; at a premium.  All adjustments, etc., including installation on the
vehicle,
&gt; are done by hand.  No tools are needed.
&gt;
&gt; Someone put a lot of thought and some good engineering into this rack's
&gt; design.  I'd cheerfully pay 2 or 3 times what it actually cost me to buy a
&gt; replacement if that became necessary.
