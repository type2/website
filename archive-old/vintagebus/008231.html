I've got a few questions that I need help with.

First off, my bus doesn't have reverse lights and there is a nice set on a
bus in junkyard about 30 miles from here.  Is it possible to take the
nosecone from my 66 bus and drill and tap it for a reverse light switch?

Next off, I wanted to know about the front shift rod coupler.  It's been
giving me major problems.  What I have is something similar to but not
exactly as Bentley depicts.  Bentle shows a longer tube with 2 screws in it.
I only have one narrow collar with one twisted off screw in it.  I've
sucessfully drilled it out and proceeded to mash and mar the tubes up quite
a bit just trying to remove them.  I've taken wd40, a torch, and an air
hammer and have managed to poke a hole in my rear shift rod tube.  I guess
maybe I should have just left the damn thing alone but it appeared to me
that I needed to be able to seperate them so that I can get the front axle
off when the time comes.  I'm thinking of just hacksawing the rods apart but
that will really get me nowhere as I won't be able to put them back
together.

Also, how do the 2 rods seperate?  Does the collar come off or is it
integral with the forward shift rod?  I think that knowing what it supposed
to actually be removed will help me take this damn thing apart.  Thanks for
the help..
