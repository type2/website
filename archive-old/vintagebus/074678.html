AJ Sims is a great guy to deal with it A+++++++++++

I have never had the problem you describe, and have jetted Kadrons to run
great on a variety of VW motors.

&gt; Hi Volks- has anyone who uses Kadron carbs ever had the secondary venturi
&gt; (the little circular thing in the throat of the carb) come loose and be
&gt; sucked into the engine? Also, anyone had any experience with A.J. Sims
(Mr.
&gt; Kadron of LowBugget_dot_com)?In case you can't tell, I'm having a problem.....
