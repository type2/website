Yesterday  I decided to tinker with the barndoor.  I had just changed st gear 
box oil in a friend bus, only to find no oil in it, just water and crud. 
(funny how it works betetr with oil)  and I was wondering if the oil in the 
53's SGBox had been changed.  As I could not remember that it had been done 
for at least 5 years, I decided it was time.  But for somereason the cover 
plate on the bottom did not want to come off the STBox, but it was dripping, 
so I just left the bucket under there and let it drip.  

For some reason the fill is on the top and you fill through the floor, so I 
removed the tatty floor mat and proceeded to slather it liberally with 
Glycerin, to helpfully preserve it some.  the stuff does help.  Did the back 
half of the front seat too.

With all this talk of over heating I decided to put an oil temp guage in it.  
I had found this VDO guage with a face same style asa later speedo, dated 
5/57 at a swap meet, with sender.   I had no idea if it works, so I took some 
wire and the guage and sender and hooked it up in the engine compartment.  
Guage hot to battery, ground to sender, sender also has a ground.  ground 
bracket of sender on engine.  ok, guage swings over.

Boil water, put in insulated coffee cup, bring to bus, insert dipstick 
sender, guage reads about 90   (guage is in Celcius)  just then Bob shows up 
and says do I want a thermometer for the water, I say sure, and he finds one 
which shows the water to be 180 F, by which point it ad cooled slightly and 
the VDO guage read about 80C (about 175 F)   SO the guage is slightly off.  
But If I know that it is ok.  also I think the guage is adjustable, screws on 
back.  heck, its over 40 years old, I am surprised it works. 

so how to install in dash.  ok cut round hole.  :)  but there is no dash.  

found a one guage bracket in my drawer o junk, it was rusty chrome so I scuff 
it with 80 grit and paint it flat black.  attach with the 10mm bolt on the 
right side of dash slightly under the right side fuse box.  Angled pointing 
at driver it it very visable. The flat black actually goes well with the 
beige paint and the black wheel and bakelite dash bit.

well, I hooked up the power, (I like screw terminal wiring) and a wire back 
to the sender, but no light to it.  Do you realise the early dashs are pretty 
dark at night, just the speedo lights glowing, no radio or gas guage or extra 
guages or any of that.  I had recently put a lighted cigarette lighter in my 
65, in the radio block out plate (was cut when I got it) and it shines light 
onto the tray under it, which is actually helpful for finding junk on the 
tray at night.  Any way, guess I'll finish hooking that up today and see what 
happens when I drive.

The SGBox has been open all night, wonder if its done dripping.

&lt;&lt; Yesterday went over to Berg and picked up one of their dipstick gauges
 since the 62 DC got hot coming back from the classic and I wanted to see
 if it was just because the bonehead mechanic (that's me) had let the
 front brakes drag or there was really something wrong with the motor.
 I'd planned on putting on a VDO gauge, but in talking with the Berg
 folks, they informed me that in all their testing the VDO units were
 VERY inaccurate.  The fact that the warning light dipstick gauge was 1/3
 the price also convinced me.
