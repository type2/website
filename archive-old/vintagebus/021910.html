Hey Emmet,

This might be more painful than you originally thought, but here it goes.

None of the parcel shippers will touch it so you must go with a LTL ( less
than truck load) carrier like Roadway etc.  They will pick it up wherever
you need them too but you must have it packed and ready to go.  I would
think a place like Mailboxes Etc would be able to pack it and even arrange a
pick-up of goods...  Be liberal with the packing foams because these LTL
guys are not the nicest on materials. 

Not the greatest answer since I have not done it before, but hopefully will
lead you in the right direction.
