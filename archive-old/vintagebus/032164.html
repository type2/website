Subject: Trip report: Mount Palomar

I just put a new engine on my 1960 Westfalia, so I was eager to go out for
a little cruise around the countryside from San Diego. I've never been up
to Mount Palomar, site of the world's second biggest optical telescope, but
always wanted to.

So, of Iwent! I'm still breaking in the engine, so it was nice and slow on
the freeway, which was fine this Sunday morning, until I was able to get
off onto highway 76, and eastward bound.

This was my first time here and was pleasantly surprised by the prettiness
of the countryside, consisting of gentle mountains covered by orange trees.
It was cloudy, obscuring the higher mountain tops, and the oranges stood
out in greater contrast due to the darker conditions. Very pretty.

I soon got to Mount Palomar itself, taking the South Grade road up to the
5500 foot summit. It wasn't a race, so I took it nice and easy - second
gear most of the way up the 7% slope replete with switchbacks. Fortunately
there was very little traffic and plenty of room to turn off and let people
past. Cars coming by the other way were covered with snow; I was wondering
where on earth it was snowing? 

Soon I got up into the clouds and had my answer as the sleet fell around
me, but there was very little of it; the cars I saw must have been parked
overnight. Going at my nice, easy pace and with no heat it started to get a
little cold, but nothing sitting on my hand wouldn't solve.

Finally, it was up to the top where sat the majestic dome of the
obseratory. It was big! Too bad it was obscured by the clouds and I
couldn't get as good a view as I could have. I had a chance to thaw out for
a bit, see how the observatory was built, and then was the fun part - back
down the mountain! Just put it in third and sit back...

Things were going well so instead of heading back to San Diego I headed the
other way and out to the desert for some good cruising, but as it was
getting dark I didn't go far before I decided to turn around.

Now one thing I hadn't taken into consideration was that it was darned
cold, and with the sun sinking it was only going to get colder, and I had
mountains to go back over before I got back to San Diego. Back uphill,
getting out of the way of all the busy people in their big 4x4's and
pick-up trucks; everyone else must be more important than I, to be in such
a hurry to get everywhere. By the time I got to the top it was dark, and
this was where the trip got fun. My hands were freezing cold (but being
Canadian I was used to it and knew I could survive for a long time still),
back down the mountain in the dark, back and forth, back and forth. By the
time I got to the bottom I stopped for gas, paid with my card but couldn't
sign the slip because my hands were too cold. No problem, just wait a bit
to thaw out, and then off again!

I noticed something weird happen, the right turn signal stopped working...
It used to work, what changed? Ah yes, the headlights are on. Turn off the
headlights, the turn signal works; turn on the headlights, the signal no
longer signals. Hmm....

It was a peaceful journey back to home, where I could have a nice, hot
shower, put on some sweaters, enjoy some dinner, and feel the warmth flood
me from within and without.
