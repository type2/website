&lt;&lt; Hello Folks
  i am in the beginning stages of restroing a 65 Double Cab. The thing didnt 
 come with an engine,so ive since found one and rebuilt it. It is a stock 
1600 
 DP. With that part finished, i was looking at the aircleaner set up. This 
 truck didnt come with anything except what looks to be an oilbath aircleaner 
 i found inside the cab. Right now im assuming it is for this truck
................
the 65 truck air cleaner is same as 65 bus.   Metal tube on top of carb goes 
to right.  fits to rubber tube which attached to metal curved tube which 
bolts to bracket on roof of engine compartment with two bolts.  The 
aircleaner clips to the bottom of that Hope this makes sense.   I didn't see 
a nice 1500cc bus engine picture anywhere recently that I could point you to. 
 The june2000 Hot VWs has a lovely 67 westy and shows an engine pic, but it 
is screwed towards the Eberspacher, and only shows a bit of the tube from 
carb to air cleaner.  Am sure you could look at yours owners manual if you 
have one or in the Bentley book, if you have one, and see what the deal is.  
Get a Bentley book.  Just, really, get one.

  See. page M-4 1, that is a 40hpbus style aircleaner, and 65 didn't come 
with that, ignore it.

Page M-4  3 has a nice picture of a serious young man in a suit, with a motor 
that has a fresh air motor triangle bracket for the air cleaner on the left.

Turn to page K-2 14-16 for more air cleaner stuff, a discussion of when they 
were moved to the right, and nice pictures of aircleaners attached to motors, 
including a 1500 style aircleaner attached on the left with a 975mm long 
crankcase breather hose.

.My 
 question is, what other parts am i missing or atleast where can i find a 
good 
 photo of the complete system? I beleive there is a rubber bootie part i dont 
 have but what about metal ductwork? In the engine compartment there is a 
 bracket hanging down on the right side:i assume this is somthing that holds 
 the aircleaner itself, but i havent a clue as to how it all works...Of 
course 
 i could use an aftermarket paper aircleaner but i want to use the correct 
 setup for 65.\\
