Subject: Re: [VB] porsche dizzy? (was rebuilt distributors)

I believe a 019 is from an early Bus. They were also sold with a bosch blue, both were painted metallic blue and were a &quot;screamer kit&quot;.
I ran mine for a while but then I went back to my 010. I did like it though.
 
BTW, the caps/points are getting a little pricey for them.
