Somebody wrote (with regard to 'electronic' ignition systems)..

&lt;&lt;thread.  So far, most have addressed only the Pertronix unit.
&lt;&lt;Have you any experience with this unit you'd care to share?

To All:

I think it's stretching things a bit to call the Pertronix 'Ignitor'  an
'electronic ignition system'. It is a points replacement module.  The points
make up only part of your ignition system. They happens to be a major part of
the system but you still need a coil, some method of advancing &amp; retarding the
firing point and so forth.

I bought a couple of 'Ignitors' some time ago.  I coupled one to an electric
motor and a 12vdc power supply to power the 'Ignitor' and let it spin for the
equivalant of about 50,000 miles of service.  At the end of the test it was
still blinking its lights at me.  The other one was installed in a vehicle and
so far has accumulated about six thousand miles of trouble-free service.
I've been carrying the second unit as a spare. Up to about 5000 rpm I've seen
no change in performance but there is a definite improvement above that level,
apparently due to the elimination of points-bounce.  (I've run it as high as
6.500 rpm for about two hours [ie, Fresno to Bakersfield].)

I don't know what's inside the thing.  Pertronix got very defensive when I
said I wanted to write an article about the unit,  wouldn't even give
permission to publish their installation instructions.  Very weird group.  (I
spoke to three different people over a two week period, ending up talking to a
voice that claimed to be the president of the company, who was about as
friendly as a bad case of piles.)  So the answer is yes, I've used the things
but haven't written about them until now.

The Pertronix 'Ignitor' is a Hall effect sensor, probably wired to a switching
transistor.  When I bought the first unit I didn't know if it used a reed-
switch, an inductive pickup or a Hall effect sensor.  When Pertronix wouldn't
tell me what type of circuit they were using,  I bought another unit and had
it x-rayed.  I couldn't tell if the switching device was an SCR or a garden
variety switcher but the sensing part of the circuit was not a reed switch nor
inductor, leaving a Hall effect sensor as the most logical choice.  (I did a
few other tests as well.)  Beyond that, it didn't really matter -- SCR or
switching transistor, they do the same thing, which is to act as a switch for
the current flowing through your coil.  Or as a trigger for the SCR in your
CDI module.

The Hall effect was identified in the 1890's... by a guy named Hall, oddly
enough :-)  The Hall effect is an unusual magnetic anomaly that was of little
use until solid-state electronics arrived on the scene sixty years later.
Until then, if you wanted a magnetic sensor you had to wind a coil and pass a
magnet near it.  When the field of the magnet cut the coil, a voltage would be
generated.  Electrically speaking, magnetic sensors are old hat.  But within
the last twenty years or so someone discovered that the Hall effect could
cause certain types of transistors to conduct -- to turn itself on -- WITHOUT
the need for the coil.  Coils are made out of copper.  Transistors are made
out of sand.  

(I'll leave you to figure out the economic benefits :-)

There's a bit more to it, of course.  The shape and magnitude of the signal
from a Hall effect sensor is more usable than that from the typical inductor-
type magnetic pick-up and is accomplished with fewer components  In fact, Hall
effect sensors act more like switches than like magnetic pick-ups.  And they
have an outstanding Mean Time Between Failure.  That's the real beauty of the
things.

In the stock ignition system, which is based on the patents of Boss Kittering,
the points -- the switching mechanism -- is the weak link in the system.
Replacing your points with a magnetic sensor based on the Hall effect will
eliminate your points. Get rid of the points and you are freed of any points-
related problems -- and of any points-related maintenance.   Seems like a
pretty good idea... 

But simply replacing the points will produce no change in the inherent
ELECTRICAL limitations of the Kittering ignition system.  Your coil still
requires a finite amount of time to build the magnetic field that, upon
collapsing, produces the spike of energy in the secondary winding that
provides the spark we need to light the fire.

With the Kitterning system, the faster you go, the shorter the amount of time
between each spark -- and the smaller the amount of energy in each spark.  The
result is a reduction of engine efficiency at higher speeds. 

The reason I'm such a staunch advocate of Capacitance Discharge ignition
modules is because they overcome the inherent limitations of the Kittering-
type ignition system.  With the low-cost CDI module from Universal Corp, on a
four-cylinder engine, you get the maximum possible spark energy all the way up
to about 7,500 rpm.  The typical result is an improvement in fuel economy,
usually on the order of eight to fifteen percent.  (See the archives.  One guy
claimed a 25% improvement.  I figure he just needed a tune up :-)  Other
outfits -- MSD and Jacobs among them -- manufacture CDI modules but most are
intended for use on high-rpm, high-compression V8 engines.  They will work on
a low-rpm, low-compression four-cylinder engine but in doing so represent a
perfect example of Over Kill --- and over priced.  (One ad for an expensive
CDI module frequently seen in the VW magazines boasts of providing full spark
energy up to 12,000 rpm.  The last time I checked, there weren't too many
12,000 rpm veedubs crewzing around town :-) 

I've already mentioned the benefits of CDI modules many times in several
public postings as well as numerous private messages so I'm not going to waste
your time repeating myself. The bottom line is that a CDI module results in a
more efficient engine.  And it doesn't matter if the thing is triggered with
the stock points, a blinking light or a magnetic sensor.

But... you'll take a giant leap toward a zero-maintenance ignition system if
you have the courage to combine the benefits of a CDI module with magnetic
triggering, silicone-insulated non-metallic ignition leads and platinum-tipped
spark plugs.  Add a sand seal, full-flow oil filtration and hydraulic cam-
followers and your 1930's-era engine can be as maintenance-free -- and nearly
as durable -- as a modern powerplant.  

There aren't many things you can do to your bug or bus that will improve its
performance while it puts money in your pocket and adds hours to your life...
but a modern ignition system does exactly that.
