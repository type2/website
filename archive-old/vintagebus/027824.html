HI Al,
Sounds like you should be able to fix that carb.  Whichever way you go with 
the carb you really should get rid of the extractor unless you are planning 
on drag racing it way over 4,000 RPM.  Plus most likely the extractor tip 
does not get the exhaust out to one of the rear corners like the stocker 
muffler resulting in monoxide being sucked into the bus through any leaks in 
the seals of the engine lid or rear hatch!  Eric&amp;Barb
