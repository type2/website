&gt; You could try using a tap and then a bolt (with spacer)  and turning the 
&gt; bolt 
&gt; to pull the bushing out.

Hello Clara    don't even bother with a bolt  the tap itself will remove the 
bushing just keep tapping when it bottoms out the bushing will come out,  To 
install I tape the bushing to a scocket that just fits the bushing put the 
scocket and bushing combo on an extension and tap into place the tape will peel 
off the bushing as it goes in.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import
