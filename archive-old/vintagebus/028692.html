Relax Ellis,

 I'll still be camping in my road-worn, rusty-but-complete stock '66 westy.
It's just that now I won't feel as comfortable about being able to detach my
bus from the tent and drive into town for beer, pretzels and brake fluid.
I'd hate to come back to the site only to find that Uncle Jerry's
medallion-snatcher or those of his ilk had paid me a visit in my absence.
As for your comments on &quot;common sense&quot; and &quot;appropriate pricing&quot; I think
John's $10,000 primered and slammed, deluxe barndoor roofed, double door
panel non-complete project is still more exciting than other cars in that
price range, say a two year old Ch*vy Cavalier. And it's certainly worh as
much as one third of a new F*rd Explorer. But other obligations will prevent
me from &quot;stepping up to the plate&quot; to fulfill this daydream. I have a son
who is two years from entering college, a domain where the concepts of
common sense and appropriate pricing have been ignored for the last 20 years
at least. And one more note on common sense and appropriate pricing, If
&quot;poor, brow-beaten John&quot; (you're words not mine) would only have the
marketing intelligence of listing his bus as a &quot;Volkswagen Microbus Replica&quot;
he could probably get 30K for it in it's present condition.
Note the &quot;Porsche replica's&quot; that populate E-bay and you'll see what I mean.
But enough for now, I have to get back to the exciting world of meat and
poultry processing journalism. =)
John

&gt; Exactly, the &quot;Panels with Tents Club&quot; is what I had in
&gt; mind, but the Vintage Nazi faction harrassed poor John

&gt; his laboratory to coat that purple primer with Teflon
&gt; for the next time he tries to sell it.
&gt; By the way...if I take a stock panel bus and attach a
&gt; tent to it, does that make it a POS custom that I can
&gt; never suck my money back out of??

&gt; Ellis says:
&gt; Forget what those Vintage Nazis have to say, I
&gt; personally support high prices for everything- Custom
&gt; or bone stock.
&gt;
&gt; I thought that some of those guys were only sniffing
&gt; around for common sense and appropriate pricing. I
&gt; didnt think that anyone was harassed. (one R)
&gt;
&gt; Of course, &quot;Poor brow beaten John&quot; can still sell you
&gt; the panel and you can still pay $10,000 for it. Thank
&gt; God and American Freedom. You can *still* step up to
&gt; the plate!. I'm sure that he'd love to hear from you.
&gt; Maybe one of the non-regularly contributing list
&gt; members could provide you with John's email, phone
&gt; etc. You could just fly down and drive it home without
&gt; a mechanical worry. Hey, its a ready to roll $10,000
&gt; bus, Right?
&gt; Money should be no object seeing as it is clearly
&gt; worth the investment of your money. I see no reason to
&gt; worry about getting money &quot;back out&quot; of it. If you
&gt; intend to be satisfied then you will have no notion
&gt; toward ever selling. Therefore no problems! Anyone
&gt; telling you  that you can't attach a tent to your
&gt; $10,000 primered and slammed, deluxe barndoor roofed,
&gt; double door panel is clearly over stepping their
&gt; bounds. I support your upcoming purchase. We look
&gt; forward to hearing about the progress of your paint
&gt; job and minor detailing. What the heck you will have a
&gt; potential $30,000 in equity once finished.
&gt; Good luck.

&gt;
&gt; BTW: If the same ol' people are writing in &quot;all of the
&gt; time&quot; then does that mean that more people should be
&gt; writing in and contributing to the list?
&gt; Or is the goal of the list to have zero contents?
&gt; Where are all of the other listees? Off building
&gt; customs for future investment?
