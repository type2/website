&gt; Has anyone else encountered this and more importantly came up with a
&gt; solution? I pitched the pods, so putting them back in is out.

Use the engine-to-body heat tubes from a lagwagen (68+) they'll 
slip right in, and have non-toxis insulation.  I like the
really late ones that are plastic accordian things.
