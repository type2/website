Right, but you can't just waltz (or tango) into a VW FLAPS and guy
a wiper motor.  You *can* boogie in and buy a regulator.

&gt; So, I currently spend almost ALL of my free time fixing things that many
&gt; others would replace :).  Recently it was a dinky little headlight switch,
&gt; cool as hell fixin that.  Hey talk about neat - I rekeyed my locks, sure I
&gt; could have had it done for a very low price but I did get a lot of enjoyment
&gt; out of figuring how locks work (not to mention the opportunity to stick my
&gt; chest out and show the SO how handy I am.)  Next i'll be taking apart my
&gt; wiper motor - yahooooooooooo!.
