Subject: stainless steel mufflers

I have not tried one of the stainlees steel mufflers. But I have replaced 
my share of mufflers, and anything that lasts longer is god in my book. 
It is truely a nasty job!!

But I wonder if these new mufflers will be of any benefit. Stainless does 
rust. . .just at a slower rate. And mufflers generally rust from the 
inside out. With the heat that a VW makes, I am not so sure that 
stainless will be of any benefit. I, too, am interested to hear of others 
experiences.

Fishing lures are designed to catch humans, not fish. I hope this is not 
just another example.
