Subject: VW scrounging! My favorite sport!

I had a great weekend!

I had planned to spend the weekend with the Family,, but,, I had some yard work
to do,, and while cleaning, I got distracted while moving a few Bus rims,, I
decided to bust the old tires off, and see what I had.
When done, I had enough 15&quot; rims for my Deluxe project,, and 4 left over,, With
1/59 dates on them! 
Exactly what Mike is looking for,, for his Fire Extinguisher Bus!

I contacted Mike and let him know,, he was pretty stroked! 15&quot; crow's foot rims!

Any ways, I ended up fitting my family time in with my Vw time perfectly!
Wife and kids heard that a couple of Vw friends were dropping in,, they cleaned
up the house,, and prepared a feast of goodies, burgers, cakes, ,, I guess she
likes them,, I never get that treatment!,,,,

I was able to scrounge on saturday with another friend,, and he scored some Vw
parts from a bus I found in a wrecking yard!

I was able to scrounge again on sunday, at the infamous Chipps yard. We had a
great time with John, and score some more rims! He is 89 years old! and still
sharp! Told us all about Vw's 

Not as many people dropped by as anticipated by my Wife,, so I had to eat a lot
of the goodies myself!hahaha! ooooh I am hurting,,  Stinging nettles,, too much
good food, and beer! 

 I got an engine block with a 20- serial number,, a deluxe wheel beauty ring!
and a smooth side gate off an early single cab,, with logos on it! The side gate
is for a rec room wall hanging!
We had to leave the '59 356 porche behind, not enough trunk space!.. So it is
still for sale.

Now,, If I could find 3 more Deluxe 15&quot;wheel beauty rings!

I feel exhausted and in pain from the stinging nettle bushes,,, but extremely
happy with all the little things I accomplished this weekend! 
Here's to Friends, Family AND Vee-dub-ya's!
Cheers!
Jamie Rivers
on the right track to finishing the Deluxe,, due to some well placed
encouragement!
