A few days a go, I started writing a perl cgi script to handle
decoding mcode tags.  The project is evolving into an online bus
registry. The objective will be to compile a small database of
buses, who owns them, what options they have, were they are, etc.  The
only field that is required is the chassis number.

It's still in alpha mode; I still need to find/create tables and
logic for decoding colors and import codes and model information,
but I have the capture part down.

Next will be statistic generation, to replace joel's sorely missed
stats.

If you'd like to be a beta tester, let me know.
