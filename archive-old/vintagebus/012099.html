&gt;&gt; George,
&gt;&gt; Wait a minute.... You mean to tell me you set your valves every 
2000&gt;miles?
&gt;&gt; Why?
&gt;&gt; Even VW never required that... At most maybe 4000 or 5000 if they
&gt;were in
&gt;&gt; need....
&gt;
&gt;I do a valve adjustment with each oil change since my hands are
&gt;already oily and I like to keep tabs on the health of the top end.  If
&gt;one of the valves starts to lose its clearance repeatedly then I know
&gt;that the head needs attention, hopefully before something breaks loose
&gt;and trashes the pistons.
&gt;

Hey list, and many know this by now.. George, way to go! I do the same I 
check them valves every oil change, about 2000 miles or so. Just seems 
like the thing to do: greasy and doing bus work. Why wait? I differ from 
you however with the valve gaskets. I use cork, they are cheap like 50 
cents or so, and I use them once, but I use no sealant. They hold fine 
if new each time. I believe in no oil leaks, as I think you do. On the 
other hand, as I posted before, I do seal the oil gaskets on the 
strainer when I change them. To each their own I guess.
