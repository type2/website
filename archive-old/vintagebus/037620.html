&lt;&lt;  I've learned on hills to let the clutch out just to the point the
 engine bogs down and then switch from brake to gas and take off.  It's a
 no-roll start.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
As long as this is done in an instant it is not a bad thing.  We have known 
others who haved used this slipping of the clutch all the time while waiting 
at lights on hills which causes the clutch to wear out very quickly here in 
hilly Western Washington State.   Eric&amp;Barb

the clutch thing works yes, but I feel better, especially on steep SF hills 
pulling the parking brake, putting it in gear, stepping on the gas as I 
lightly lift off the clutch, when I feel it start to rock forward I let off 
the hand brake.  This way I use three pedals/levers for the three functions.  
ANd it could be easier on thcllutch maybe, buut that is not my primary 
reason.   There are a few places in Oly I use this technique too.
