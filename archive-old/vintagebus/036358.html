i would like some feedback from other upright aircooled bus drivers on
the subject of driving in extreme heat. the 1600 sp doghouse motor
currently in my bus generally runs flawlessly. i've done all the right
things to keep the motor as cool as possible. i do not run any type of
external oil cooler other than an oil filter to increase capacity.
timings perfect. carb has been recleaned &amp; checked for any missed
debris. fuel filter is new. 92 octane fuel is my only fuel used. valves
are set perfect. i run valvoline racing oil changed regularly. i drive
in 100+ degree temps daily around the desert southwest region of the
country. when the motor is cold it fires immediately. when the motor is
refired after less than 5 minutes of sitting it fires immediately. if
the motor sits longer than that after driving in the heat it really
takes some cranking &amp; gas pedal pumping to get it to refire. on
ocassion after driving during the day when i shut down it will diesel
for a moment. any thoughts? thanks, terry delaney
