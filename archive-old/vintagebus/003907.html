It's Friday!! Hooray! Going back to commercial sittings of buses and Playboy
appearances I just have to add this one that I noticed on our local TV.
There is this advertisement running for some new movie, I think it's British
and there is this scene there where everybody stands in front of a Bus,
white/green. Go to be somewhere in England but would be nice to know if this
baby has some kind of major role in this movie. I'll have to watch for this
ad again since I don't remember the title. Another thing that might be worth
watching is the movie made for TV and coming on this Sunday, might be either
on CBS or NBC. Title is The '70's. Might be interesting.
Well, just my 2 cents for Friday.

Later,
Andre Hryn

&gt;
&gt; That bus is owned by SV2s member Greg Frias. I've seen it a couple of
&gt; times myself. I don't think the bumper stickers are his, though...
