Subject: Re: Heads blowing etc 


I took the van to my usual mechanic for a couple of 
minor things last week and he advised me that my 
cylinder heads are blowing a little, and although he 
didn't say it was vital to get it fixed straight away, 
he told me it would need a bit of grinding and quoted 
me a price.

I (and he) was in a bit of a rush, so I left it at 
that, but could somebody fill me in with blowing 
cylinder heads? What exactly is happening? Am I losing 
fuel consumption/performance/engine life?

Heads blowing simply means that your cylinder heads are loose.  If you 
don't fix the problem it will only get worse and can actually burn 
grooves into you heads( trashing them ).  A quick fix is to retorque 
the lower cylinder head nuts, although this *MAY* temporarily stop the 
problem the right thing is to retorque all the cylinder head nuts 
which will require pulling the engine and removing the tin. 

And YES, you are losing fuel consumption/performance/engine life!

Good luck, 

Jeff
