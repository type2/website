Subject: Carb Jetting

Hey y'all
Seems my ISPs been randomly refusing e-mail so I got yanked from the
list.  Thanks Thom for letting me know that was happening.

The Tinkertoy's doing much better since the retorque.  Whilst I was in
there, I took a look at the plugs.  I had replaced them with the new top
end and thought maybe they could tell me a story.  They sure enough
did.  She's been running REAL lean.  THat might explain why she doesn't
pull hills well and get warm on the highway.  Pulled the main jet and
found it was a 120.  Remember this is a 1600 sp.  The same carb that was
on the previous engine, which by the numbers was a 1300!  Hmmmm..

So I went to my local FLAP and found the biggest jet he had, a 130. 
Gee.  I didn't think I was supposed to feel acceleration or be able to
break 60mph on the highway.  All that and significantly cooler oil temps
at speed.  Anyways,

WHat are the recommended settings for a 1600 being fed by a Solex Pict
30?
