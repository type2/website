Our ordinance here is that if you can hide it behind a code conforming
fence, no one needs to know it's there and they can't complain.  Otherwise,
according to the newspaper article that I so carefully read, you must have a
vehicle licensed or insured (note the &quot;or&quot; clause and no &quot;and&quot; clause) in
order to have it be legal.  So it's easy to get around the law - I get real
cheap &quot;storage&quot; insurance and when the neighboor nazi phones me in (as he
did repeatedly in 1997) to the cops, I've proved my case numerous times.  He
even phones me in for trumped up stuff and the cops are so tired of it, they
just drive by to appease him but they don't do anything to us anymore.  My
favourite thing to do is when I catch him or his wife &quot;spying&quot; on us through
their window, I immediately stop and drop what I'm doing and just blatantly
stare at them.  Staring matches have lasted up to 3 minutes so far and I
will not back down.  Hell, one day, the old bag was so startled, she dropped
the blinds down so fast she knocked her plants off the ledge and the other
day, the old man was obviously teed at me after a starting match.  Sure
enough, about 5 minutes later, the cops drove by.  He phones me in for
staring at him - what a bore he is.

Even though my neighbors hate me, I am conforming to the law, and they hate
me even more.  I love it!
