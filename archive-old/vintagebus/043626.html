&gt;This gives me 3 pick-up points to check oil temp.  [...]  The only thing 
&gt;I was thinking of if I use a 3 position switch will it change the readings
&gt;due to the resistance in the switck?

Probably not.  Most resistance-type automotive temperature sensors have
a range somewhere in the few tens of ohms to few thousands of ohms.
A really badly wired switch might have 1 ohm resistance and 0.5 or 0.1
ohm is more like it.  I don't think the switch will cause enough error
to be significant.

I was previously talking with my friend Jim about this topic -
temperature gauges for a VW engine.  Jim is a mechanical engineer,
currently working for DaimlerChrysler in Detroit.  A couple of
tidbits he told me...

&gt;Actually, CHT is probably more accurate than coolant temperature anyway,
&gt;even in a water-cooled engine, provided the sensor is located in the right
&gt;place (in this case, &quot;the right place&quot; is on the backside of a combustion
&gt;chamber, kind of inconvenient to get to without specialized castings with
&gt;that feature designed-in.)  The reason?  The purpose of the cooling system
&gt;is to maintain the correct combustion chamber wall temperature -- too hot
&gt;and it'll pre-ignite (detonate), too cold and you don't get efficient
&gt;combustion.  But so you know, we measure skin temps of various and sundry
&gt;things by epoxying thermocouples to the surface of whatever it is that we
&gt;want to measure.  Done right, it's within reasonable precision.  Doing it
&gt;right involves cleaning the surface, holding the TC in place with a bit of
&gt;tape further up the lead, and putting the (generous) dollop of epoxy over
&gt;it.  Let it sit, remove the tape, and you're good to go.  Just make sure
&gt;the epoxy you're using is up to the anticipated temperature range.  If
&gt;you're putting something on the exhaust side of the head (which I'd
&gt;recommend over the intake side as it's considerably more stable and useful
&gt;information), you want to be able to handle temps up to around 1000F.  

&gt;Okay, remember that TCs operate on the principle of dissimilar metals.  You
&gt;*can* put intermediate connections between the TC and the measurement
&gt;device provided you keep the law of dissimilar metals.  We use different
&gt;types of TCs depending on application -- probe-types that can be inserted
&gt;into a compression fitting brazed onto an AC line, or zip-tied behind the
&gt;grille, for example, and simple TC wires that are strung and secured as
&gt;needed.  Probes have a banner connector already attached -- that's the
&gt;little plastic guy with the two flat prongs of different sizes -- this is
&gt;hooked up to some TC wire and run to the logger, where there's usually
&gt;another Banner connector and a little jumper of TC wire attached to the
&gt;logger's input card (which typically has the &quot;reference temp&quot; TC mounted on
&gt;it, hence the term &quot;differential TC&quot;).  We use the jumpers so that we can
&gt;easily reconfigure, trouble-shoot, or swap loggers as necessary (we are
&gt;trying to use a fairly standard configuration for the loggers with channels
&gt;XX-YY being TCs, AA-BB being pressures, CC-DD being RPMs, EE-FF being
&gt;flows, etc., so we can pull a logger from one and put it in another truck
&gt;if necessary.  Sometimes, they just run the TC wire in directly, no
&gt;intermediate connectors.
&gt;
&gt;We'll run temporary setups of up to 5-6 TCs with just a Fluke meter to read
&gt;'em if there's a vehicle that's acting weird and we need to check on it --
&gt;passenger will switch and record data.  Generally, though, we'll run a
&gt;little data logger like a Campbell 21X for those kind of deals.

Some DMMs have a thermocouple input.  Or, get an adapter for most
standard DMMs from Actron for $10 at
http://www.actron_dot_com/cgi-bin/web_store.cgi?page=cp7861.htm .  I
have two of these and they are neat.  The only problem is that the
thermocouple that comes with them only has about two feet of
thermocouple wire on it...you'd have to make a thermocouple
&quot;extension cord&quot; with thermocouple wire and connectors.

This is probably way more than you wanted to know.  :)

Matt
