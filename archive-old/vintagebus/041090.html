That's whats on my bus now and I'm not thrilled with them.
I'm hoping to find a used or nos VWoA set from the sixties.
thanks,

                   woody
           &quot; keep on pushin'&quot;


&gt; If you're ok with NOS, head over to the Wolfsburg West site
&gt; (www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com) and pick up a pair of them.  These guys have a
&gt; pretty decent amount of hard to find items.
&gt; Good luck,
&gt; -wes
