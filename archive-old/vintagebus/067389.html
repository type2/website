It all has to do with the density of stored energy. A pound of gasoline has 
approximately 100 times the energy of a pound of lead and acid. The average ICE 
(internal combustion engine) delivers less than 20% of the energy in gasoline 
to the driving wheels. The rest is lost as heat. Electric motors deliver more 
than 80% of the energy to the wheels. The challenge is clear... develop better 
energy storage for electric motors. The motivation is to reduce consumption of 
non-renewable petroleum and pollute less. 
A 1995 study says the average private vehicle trip was 11.8 miles in 20.1 
minutes for a speed of 35.4 mph. EV's fit this need. EV owners can borrow, rent 
or maintain a second car for longer trips or use trains, buses or planes. 
All this technology is worth studying, it's as sure to come as the oil supply 
is sure to dry up.
