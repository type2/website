Subject: the joys of a new bus

While pulling the transmission out last night because the other one
just doesn't want to change gears without making a whole lot of noise.
I got an oppertunity to check things like gearboxes and such. I'm
happy to report that at least one of the PO's of my bus were religious
about maintenance. Yup, thats right. I can now say without a shadow of
a doubt that the brake shoes have been properly oiled just like the
outside of the RGB. :) But much better to find this out in my own
schedule than while needing to stop before hitting some nuns crossing
the street. No question this time, just venting. &lt;thinks to self&gt;I
wonder if they changed the blinker fluid? ;-_)
