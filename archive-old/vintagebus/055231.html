Subject: lowering the bus

I love this topic.... lower it down, raise it up....

anyway, I'm getting ready to finish up the rear end of the double cab and
I'm using a Wolfsburg West rear kit to lower it.  According to the
directions they sent, the rear spring plates should be set to 6-8 degrees.
I set both sides to 7 which puts them right in the center of the travel
available for the spring plate... Is this correct? I'd rather have the back
end up a little bit instead of having the assend dragging look....
Comments? other than raise it back up :-)
