Hey everyone,

I know its not Friday, but I just had to shout out the good news we've
had here at the Harris household to the great list collective I've come
to be part of.  Last night (a bit before the witching hour on Holloween
) at 11:34pm, Joseph William Harris was born.  He tipped the scales at 9
lbs. 2 oz.. and stands...or lays ....21&quot; long.  Mother and son are
resting comfortably and all went well with the arrival.  4 1/2 year old
big sister is ecstatic over her new playmate and is planning of showing
him the finer points of spotting busses &amp; old and new herbie cars.

Boy I guess I really have to finish the Westy now....if we're ever to go
camping with the whole family!  Nice to have one on the boys team too.
The estrogen was getting mighty thick around these parts.   I think a
new bus toy is in order ;-)  Never too soon to start...right?   :-)

Joseph     9 lb. 2 oz.
