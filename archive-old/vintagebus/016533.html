Yes.  Ten miles outside of Memphis, Texas.  At 2 A.M.  With long hair
and a beard.  I don't recommend this as a form of recreation.

You will most likely find that at least one of the bearings in the
generator has seized.  Don't try to rebuild it yourself, unless you do
that sort of thing for a living.  The really hot bearing tends to
cause the insulation on the coils to degrade, so just replacing the
bearings isn't enough.  It'll work for a while, but then you'll stop
getting power out of it (at best).  I'd just buy a new/rebuilt one.
Replace the belt, as well, since it really doesn't take that sort of
abuse well.
