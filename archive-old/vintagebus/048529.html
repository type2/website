&gt; I've seen one installed under the driver's seat and it looked
&gt;to me like a factory installation, but I realize the most common place is in
&gt;the engine bay opposite the battery.


You can put them wherever they will fit, under the dash, under the front,
in the engine compartment, under the rear seat, behind the front seat.  In
the bugs, some were mounted under the hood next to the instrument cover or
in the spare tire wheel well.

The nice thing about a gas heater is they are small and as long as you have
the heat sheilds on, you can put them about anywhere you want, so long as
you run the exhaust to the outside and you draw fresh air in for the
combustion chamber.

A gas heater is a very nice way to heat a cold vehicle.  Gas heaters have
been used in vehicles since the early days of automobiles.  The military
uses them in everything from tanks to troop transports.  Small airplanes
use them along with small boats with cabins and semi sleeper cabs.
