Subject: 66 bus must sell- VW Planet

Jarad Poser jmposer_at_netscape_dot_net has a bus for sale in Austin, Tx.

Dont know the fella and have never seen this bus BUT...
I saw a similar bus at the Rocky Mtn Motorworks Show a couple years ago. If
it's the same type then the fiberglass top is asymetrical sloping from the
drivers side and flattening out as shown on the passanger side. The interior of
the bus that I saw was practical and nice. Anyone shopping for a starter bus
might check out Jarad's bus a little further. I'd suggest that Jarad post a few
more photos. Shoot, for $775 you cant lose. Especially if it's a walk
through...
Just my opinion,
Jim Ellis
Phoenix, AZ
