 Greetings all! I have recently acquired a 195? standard sunroof bus. I have
 placed it on the vintage bus auction =
 (http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/cgi-bin/auction/addbid.cgi?number=3D1280),
 but am really wanting to learn some more about this bus. Being a standard
 sunroof, I know it was never officially imported to the states. I still dont
 know what year it is. I'd love to trade this thing for a 21 window or D/S
 Cab. Mebbe other possibilities as well. It is just a bit more than I can
 handle right now. Anyone with some info or interest
 please let me know. Thanks in advance!

A friend of mine has a standard micro w/ sunroof that not only was imported 
to seattle as per the M code tag, he is the 3rd owner and has papers for it 
from the OO.   

to find more about your bus, find the VIN # .  That will tell you when the 
bus was buildt.  AFter about ch 398xxx (around 59 model year) they got m code 
tags behind the pass seat, which gives beaucoup info.   Does the bus have 
sempahores?   50s euro spec buses came w/ semaphores.  if it has the pointy 
turn signals, not used euro spec till 61-63 buses (later than on n am spec 
buses)

does bus have tempered windsheilds, or laminated (the laminated kind get 
foggy and crack)

brake light in deck lid?
looked for pic, but the url you gave said there isnt that auction or somesuch
