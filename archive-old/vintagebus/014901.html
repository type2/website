&gt; Well, yes.  But then to get fuel flowing again, you have to leave it
&gt; in reserve, which means you're SOL if you don't keep a close eye on
&gt; the odometer.  Unless you've got a trick for getting it to go back to
&gt; the main-only position....

No, if the valve is halfway between the normal and reserve positions,
nothing flows, even if the tank is full.
