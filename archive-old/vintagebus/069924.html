Subject: Re: [VB] survey: testing cooling etc [VB] was side scoops 

Yes, if the engine compartment seals are perfect, what we would look for 
is a possible increase of engine compartment air pressure, with or 
without, say scoops.  Do scoops help?  What's going on in there?  If we 
could increase the perfect engine compartment's air pressure this would 
help cooling and carburation, if the air was cool and fresh!  Gary Gibson
