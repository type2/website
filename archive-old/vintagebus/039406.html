Subject: Re: [VB] Euro Tails Again

Thanks Matt,

Looking at the diagram I was thinking the wire from the box to the MC switch 
should stay!  Thanks!

Eric
66dlxhrdtpwkndr soon to have euro tails that work!


&gt;It sounds like you disconnected *both* wires at the MC switch, which
&gt;isn't right.  You have to disconnect one wire and leave the feed wire
&gt;hooked up.  To find the feed wire, turn on the key but don't step on
&gt;the brakes.  Go under the Bus and try your test light from ground to
&gt;each wire in turn.  The one that lights the light is the one that
&gt;should stay connected to the switch.  Disconnect the other one and
&gt;turn the key off.  Run *one* new wire from the now-open terminal on
&gt;the master cylinder switch to the right rear.  Hook that new wire
&gt;to the brake (bright) filament, and run a jumper from there over to
&gt;the brake filament on the left side.
