as I have the no engine for a little while, I though I might as well change
the tranny fluid, new boots and whatever else i can get at while i wait...

I remember someone recommending swepco? tranny fluid...i have no idea where to
get this, nor have I seen the gl-4 stuff anywhere around here.

Any houston listees know where to get this? any listees know a way to mail
order this stuff?
thanks
