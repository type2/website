Subject: Re: [VB] Sears and flywheels

Speaking of sears...
 
  I got a sweet deal there a few weeks ago.  As I was wandering through the tool department, I stumbled upon some Milwaulkee drills on clearance.  I picked up a 3/8&quot; holeshooter for $28( regular $89.99), and a right angle 1/2&quot; heavy duty( regular $245.99) for $64.99!  Both drills were factory sealed, discontinued models I guess.  It makes me feel better now when I'm forced to pay too much for one of their other tools.
 
Bus Content - I also bought a 1 5/8&quot; socket to tighnten my RGB (41mm) nuts. -On sale for $11.00
 
Matt- still haven't tested my flywheel
