Subject: Break in tips?

The assembly is done on the DP 1600.  New P/C's and rebuilt heads along
with all the usual seals and exhaust stuff.   Will be  running it on the
floor before I put it in the DC.  The short block was not touched and
was nice and tight and was well within specs.  Should I follow the Tom
Wilson book and conventional wisdom and run at 2K for 20 min., or should
I modify that since I'm only breaking in the p/c's and valve train?

Thanks!

Steve
