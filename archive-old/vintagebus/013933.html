....sorry to say though...a month, a day or a
year...'almost' and 'near' only counts in horseshoes
and hand gernedes!

FWIW, Barndoor westys interiors are similar but quite
different then late `55 interiors...mainly has to do
with the spare tire hump in the bench partition...puts
all the drawers stove ect in a differnt placing.

Imagine if you were like only a day from barndoor
status....(insert cheesy wrong answer music ala' TV
game shows....WA WA WAHHHHHHhhh....!)

&gt; Apples an oranges.  Being a year older doesn't

&gt; missing the x-files season

&gt; they occur occur at a
&gt; specific point in time, and you're either there or
&gt; you're not.
&gt; 
&gt; If my bus had been born a month earlier (march
&gt; instead of april) then
&gt; it might have been a barndoor.  This is significant
&gt; because being a
&gt; barndoor is significant.  In another case, the
&gt; difference between
&gt; a september of 57 and october of 57 would probably
&gt; have no significance
&gt; only because we haven't identified anything
&gt; significant historically
&gt; about that time period.

&gt; &gt; That's ridiculous.   
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I missed being a year older by a year.
