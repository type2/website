Subject: Email upkeep the easy way...

Hi Real Bus People  Being a newbie here I remember
someone writing in that they wanted off the list
because they could not keep up with all the GREAT!
emails.Well here is my easy fix...hope it is legal
here........I use Hotmail as a backup site and leave
my personal address book empty there....and check the
options page on the hotmail site to send all mail to
the &quot;Junk Mail&quot; folder.Where it stays for 14 days or
so then gets an automatic delete from the Hotmail
system.Before that time you can read it or reply to it
or whatever.No more stuffed inbox..Which you can save
for your close email buds only...Well just a
thought.Works great for me....Might be good news for
the other newbies with a sore delete
finger.......Oh,the bus ...Yep, I see it out
there....about the same.Got to get on those split
window seals....after my nap.....zzzzzzzzzzzzzz
