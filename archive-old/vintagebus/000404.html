Hey Etienne,
You don't want to put that electric ventilator crap in your bus...they don't 
work worth a damn.  Mail it to me and I will dispose of it properly for you.
In return I will send you a high quality oscillating dash fan that works 
excellent.  I bought it at a specialty parts dealer here in the U.S. called
'Pep Boys'.

Sorry guys, couldn't resist,
