Subject: The Great Power Pulley Controversy
Date: Mon, 07 Feb 2000 12:10:21 PST
Mime-Version: 1.0

Oh, wise list.

I have been running a power pulley on my Baja for many years with no 
problems.  Everybody seems to think it is wrong to use one on the street, 
but the early Porsches used a pulley about this size.

The temp seems to stay the same with the power pulley and I get a little 
extra horsepower at the wheels.

Does anyone know of any studies that prove if a power pulley really causes 
overheating? Back in &quot;the day&quot; all of my VW buddies ran them with no 
problem. Of course, none of us had Busses.
