Subject: Friday, oops I broke my bus

I broke a gland nut (no, not one of mine) from over tightening once,
my friend (her car) started to cry but I felt real tough. Fortunately
the threaded bit can be screwed out by hand real easy once the head is
sheared off.
Happy friday, I think I'll mess it up by going to work.

Subject: FW: [VB] (Friday) Don't forget... Was Header woes


Back when I was new to VW's and did not have much mechanical smarts, I
tightened my flywheel on to what felt tight to me.
I used a 1/2 drive ratchet that was about 12&quot; long.  Needless to say
the bus
made it about 4-5 blocks before the flywheel spun off and ruined my
crank
and alot of other stuff...oh yeah, it was an engine i just bought and
had
less than 10 miles on it.  After having it rebuilt again, everything
works
fine and I don't work on my engine too much anymore.
