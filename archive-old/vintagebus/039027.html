Subject: 58 bus/sc dash grab handle?
Message-ID: &lt;D3C18AEA0EA1D111B8DA00805F85E889011F8FFB_at_dsntexsrv3.diasham_dot_com&gt;

Was the passenger-side, dash-mounted grab handle an option in 58?  My 58 sc
doesn't have one (much to my wife's chagrin), but I've seen pictures of 58
buses that do have them.  I'd like to install one, but am a little hesitant
to drill holes in my un-cut dash.

Thanks.
