Subject: [VB] Hemp Seat Covers !!

My wife and i made some really nice Hemp Front  bucket seat covers for my 66
walkthrough. They are made from a 55%hemp 45% cotton denim twill. This is an
8oz fabric and it is pre washed. They are made to fit exactly , which isnt
easy, so the passenger side has 2 seperate covers and the driver side is
attached with snaps. There is a nice elastic pocket on the back of the
drivers seat, tool roll size. These are perfect for a daily driver to
protect your resto seats or to get by until you can get some nice seats,
they are preshrunk and washed and washable in the washing machine!  The
Hemp/Denim is very nice for dyeing tooo, it works well with procion and rit
dye.  We value them at $50 a pair, and we need parts ! And because i spent
all my cash on parts, we need money too :).
If anyone is interested please email me for pics.
And if anyone has a rear seat for my 66 let me kno, im into a fold down bed
type if you have that,  and as soon as i have that  i will have rear seat
covers available as well.
i have a 79 west as well, so curtains(incl front snap in)  and seat covers
are available for those years.
