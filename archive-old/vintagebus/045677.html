 This is Tim again, the guy whose in MO with no fourth gear. everything is
 set for a place to stay, tools and a spot to work on the bus at my relatives
 in Kansas. ....
     So if you would, what type of transmission do I exactly have. I have a
 66 standard Bus, from what I can see its the orig swing axle transmission
 and its called a big nut type as apposed to ealier busses?? (what year did
 they change). I don't mind going 55 on the highway, but know there are
 options to change types of tranny that involves welding and some that don't.
 I know people love to share their success and horror stories about
 companies, and just love to give out advice, so I'm all ears. What do you
 guys (girls) think would be the best route to getting 4rth gear back, on the
 quicker side (don't want to wear out my welcome).
  &gt;&gt;
odds are you have a tunnel case big nut transaxle.   Look at the rear axle
nuts- what size are they?  if they are 36mm it is small axle, and has been
replaced with one from a 63 or earlier.   if they are bigger -46mm i think it
is, it is what one would expect from your bus.  it is really doubtful that you
have a split case center section- with one of those you have to come to a full
and complete stop before 1st or reverse, else you grind.- visually the case is
split down the middle from front to back like the engine case, take a peek
under neath if you have a doubt.   the seam would run just like the seam in
the engine case.

don't see any reason to do anything involving welding.  what you want will
bolt right in there.   so, what to do?   if you have no problems with the
reduction gears, you need a good center section and to swap the axles over.
sounds like you want to do as much of the work as possible, so to me that is
all but the actual center section.   Either you can find a rebuilder, and get
them to do it, or find a bug one you know is good, and put your axles on it.  

 If possible, get a friend who doesn't mind getting dirty, and preferably has
vw wrenching experiencence to help- some thinngs go a lots faster with two
people. buy them some beer.  take pictures.

if you go the rebuilder route, you pull the motor, put ye olde bulli up on a
big block under the tranny carier tube (u shaped thingy under the rear) and
disconnect the brakes, drain the tranny oil, and pull the tranny, pull the
axles, and send/take the center section to the builder.  Is there a VW shop
locally you can ask for recommendations? You can also get different ring and
pinion gearing- the final drive, which changes your speed.   a 3.88 (31 teeth
on ring, to 8 teeth on the pinion shaft) makes you go faster, but is more
involved than the stock options of 8 to 33 (4.12) or 8 to 35(4.38), so the
thing might be to get a 4.12 r&amp;p, if you don't want to pay extra for a freeway
flyer of 3.88, actual there are other ratios with seven teeth on the pinion
shaft, im stopping this as im getting confused.  but the ring gear has the
number of teeth written on the side somewhere, actual, at least on some.

if you use a bug tranny, you need to get the tranny out of the swing axle bug,
and pull the axles off it, the ring gear needs to be turned the other way, or
you will have 4 reverse and one forward gear.   things need shimming in there
with the cover plates. put your reduction boxes on it, and install.   

I don't know if I am simplifying it or confusing things or not.    I put a
used tranny in my 65 camper when the one I got with it kept popping out of
reverse, but the replacement was noisy and popped out of reverse, not an
improvement.  That's why I say don't go through all the work with a mystery
tranny.   And you get really dirty.    I like to soak everything  - in engine
compartment and under, even the under side of the engine lid and the engine
paint, and under the cylinders and around the tranny as you are doing that- in
simple green and take it to the car wash before pulling a motor, then I get
dirty but not filthy.  Local laws may vary in terms of washing motors.  All
disclaimers apply.  A clean motor is more pleasant to work on, and impresses
people

Take this time to do other things- how are
rear brake lines
gas line - replace 
engine to body seal
 good time to pull tank to replace gas guage sender if needed.
engine oil and main sealing need changing?
check and reset if neccessary engine end play
clean up wiring.
add thermostat if missing
switch to doghouse set up?
check and if needed replace generator brushes
tune up motor - easier to get to plugs/valves
make sure the grommets are in place for the lines/hoses that run through
metal.
and such like

and grease all bolts putting it back together.  It can be a real bear removing
a tranny that has been in a long time, so grease the bolts for future ease of
work.

have oil drain pans, containers for fluids, and lots of rags handy.  Block the
buses front wheels when you pull the tranny, be safe.   put the rear wheels
unde rthe bus too, like john muir says  read up on it in the idiot book or
whatever, before doing this if you haven't before.
