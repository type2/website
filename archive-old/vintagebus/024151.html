Hi Volks,
One of the biggest things we wish VW would do is to allow aftermarket parts 
with thier blessing and logo on them.  This is now being done with many 
British auto parts for vehicles of the 1950s-70s.  The original manufacture 
agrees to allow the use of thier logo on repro parts as long as it is up to 
original specifications, and the logo owner is given a cut of the profits.
