Hey there guys and gals!
For some odd reason today, I got motivated to clean out the garage and
organize my basement parts stash.  This included bringing the 62's old
1500 engine downstairs to eventually figure out what was wrong with it.
(remember my &quot;knock knock&quot; posts?)  So...I get even more motivated
tonight and decide to tear into it.  I pull the right head off (pass.
side) and see that #1 has some issues.  The bottom of the pistion is
nicely munched up...along with the inside of the head.  The sealing
surfaces are fine....but something got thrown around in that cylinder.
I can't find it...its embedded (or whats left of it) in the
head/piston.  So....looks like at least a new piston for me.  I can save
the head, but the piston is wasted.  The edge of it is rather chewed
up.  Oddly enough, I can see no scoring on the cylinder wall....I can't
feel any either.  So... wondering if I should just go with one new
piston and new rings....or...should i get all new pistons and
cylinders...or.. what should I do with this?  Should I re-bush the rods
while I'm at it?  curious........
