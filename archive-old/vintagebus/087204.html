Subject: Re: [T2] rear seat to bed - someone must have a couple of these

Hiya John,
 
Might be a little more difficult than that.
 
An all-too-common mistake these days is referring to any folding bed mechanism as a Z-Bed.  Take a look at ads for a Westy or Riv and the owner will refer to the &quot;Z-Bed&quot;  Someone at a swap meet will have a &quot;Z-Bed&quot; for sale complete with plywood base and cushions.  Unfortunately, neither of these are Z-Beds.  Moral of this story:  Be careful what you buy!
 
Z Products out of Wilsonville, OR made the Z-Bed mechanism.  It is strictly an aftermarket item designed to convert a standard third seat into a bed.  In application it is unseen and the standard passenger bus looks completely stock.  Z Products (now in what might best be referred to as a dormant state) ceased making the Z-Bed mechanism about five years ago.  Painful for those of us who would like to get their hands on a Z-Bed, because the shop is still there, equipment and stock intact.  The owner has moved on to other interests and does not want to get involved with the manufacture of Z-Beds again.
 
In searching around for a Z-Bed for my bus, I have found that the parts are very hard (so far, I've not found them!) to locate.  I've missed a couple of Z-Beds by mere days.  And they were spendy.  So, best of luck to you - you just may put yourself in the right place at the right time.  And if you should find two of them........let me know, OK?
