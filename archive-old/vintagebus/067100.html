Hi Chisam27,
First make sure your Philiips head fits the screw head properly.  Yes, there 
are differant sizes!  Next are you turning the impact driver counter 
clockwise at the same time you are hammering on it?  If yes to both of these 
try to tighten the screws a tiny bit and then try loosening.  Eric learned 
this while in the USAF and it is amazing how if one can just get the stuck 
threaded fastener to shift even a slight fraction of a turn which breaks 
loose the friction locking it.
