Good aircooled VW drivers usually stop for each other, IMHO, from the
rest of the thread that has developed... I think it's generally agreed
upon. Besides, anyone &quot;in the know&quot; looks up like a prairie dog when
they hear a fweeming or fwooming VW exhaust, especially when they are
broken down. If I didn't stop for one... well, my conscience wouldn't be
kind to me.
	As for the rest of the general populace... I'll probably stop. I'm not
driving much these days, but I just got the title from the people I
bought my *new* '70 Westy from, so now I can get it changed over to my
name and start working on it after *two months* &lt;!&gt; already!
	Then I'll work on the Karma thing....

&gt;  It's best to build up VW Carma on your side.You never know when you'll
&gt; brake down. I sucks to walk. That's why we drive Busses.
