It's been a while since I posted an update on my bus.  As luck would have
it, my new can of POR15 _AND_ my order from Ronnie showed up Friday evening.
I was elated as I assumed I would be putting in another weekend of stagnancy
with nothing to do.

As you all remember, I had been trying to rid the bus of the mouse smell.
As of yet, I haven't bought an enzyme cleaner but I know this will help.
Already, by cleaning out the rear deck area in the bus (which was still
pretty filthy), I can tell there is a huge difference in the stench level
for the better.  I also bought some of the cheapest and most potent
deodorizing spray I've ran across.  It's $2 for a big can and is called,
&quot;Indian Money House Blessing&quot; and has been a staple in our family for years.
I bought the Vanilla scented stuff (2 cans worth) and knowing full well that
it gives me headaches, shook both cans vigorously, taped the nozzles down,
and let them both run in the closed bus.  Allowing the sun to bake this into
the bus, I could tell when I got home from work, that the bus was enveloped
in an auro of Vanilla splendor.  I'm still going to have to scrub the front
seat area as for a while, the bus smelled like vanilla scented mouse piss
but over all, I'm gaining on it.  Last night while doing some POR15 work, I
couldn't smell the piss at all.  That was nice.

The complete tranny to reduction box assembly is assembled and everything is
POR15'd.  Looks nice.  I'm not sure about my seal on the axle flanges.  I
used the O-Ring out of the tranny rebuild kit and cut them down to size,
using RTV to seal the gap and to try to seal the area under the flange
better.  This is one of those 67 rear ends that was modified by the factory
for an o-ring.  My 66 rear is a one piece flange whereas the 67 one is 2
piece.  Keep your fingers crossed that I did a good job sealing it up.

I commemorated the arrived of my can of POR15 by using it.  I finished
painting the one axle tube, the tranny carrier, the gearshift housing,
reverse lockout plate, front floor, rear deck (over the engine) and since
the PO cut out the spare tire holder, I reached down in and nabbed some
places I had missed on top of the LR fender in the engine bay.  Even though
the rust is bad in some areas, I'm going to go ahead and paint the whole
floor just to try and stop the rust.  When it comes time to replace the
metal, I've been told it will be harder to fix, but it's better than letting
the bus rust away while I contemplating the body work.

Today, the rear end gets installed.  Thanks to Ronnie, I've gotten a bunch
of new parts that were needed and I'm finally going to be able to install
the butt at least enough to put the bus back on wheels should I need to roll
it around somewhat.  I hope I don't have any leaks.

That's about it for now.  It's neat watching this heap of a mouse house,
slowly turn into daily driver material.  She ain't pretty but she's mine.
