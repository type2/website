Eric,

Check out the very anal John Henry's GREAT site and in specific the link
to a page of his 57 Oval resto.  He made himself a jig out of plywood
and a &quot;workmate&quot;.  Great idea.  Read all the resto pages.  He made a
bunch of fixtures to help with lots of odd resto projects.  

Here you go:

&gt; of the auto glass shops have a thinner rubber seal.
