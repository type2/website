&gt;Can anyone help this lady out?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;What we would like to do is invite everyone in the Southland with a
&gt;&gt;Westphalia Volkswagen to be on hand for a media opportunity that we are
&gt;&gt;hoping to put together.

There are plenty of things that Westy drivers could do for this event...

* Print up some Kennedy, Humphrey, Wallace, McGovern, or Hospers
  bumper stickers, and put them on your Buses beforehand.

* Get some of those vinyl/magnetic signs made up for all the Buses.
  They could advertise businesses, like &quot;the Plumbers&quot;.

* Get everyone driving a Bus to show up in black suits, white shirt, 
  tie, sunglasses.  Put an old transistor-radio earpiece in your ear
  and talk into your suit sleeve a lot.

* Bring your cell phone to the event.  If someone calls you, answer
  it with &quot;F_at_ck Hoover. Hello.&quot;

* There will probably be a lot of waiting around involved.  Bring some
  reading material, like http://www.amazon_dot_com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671894412 .
