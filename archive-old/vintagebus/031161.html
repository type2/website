Subject: BPA addresses?

Hey folks,

Does anyone have an e-address for the Boise Bus Pilots?  Their
webmaster, Troy Wheeler *was* a WetWesties listmember but has apparently
unsubscribed.  My wife, Lisa, has to spend a couple days in Boise to
visit a friend in the hospital and we're looking for a driveway to park
the bus in.

Thanks.
