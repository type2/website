Subject: 1961 Double Cab... 07-13-03

After the success of getting the windowshields in earlier in the 
week, I decided to yank the front headlight that I had broke the 
lense on when I went to install it. While I had it out, I slipped an 
&quot;eyebrow&quot; in there. These are real cheap and have to be bent in order 
to fit. But I think they look cool. Others don't.

I installed an eyebrow on the other headlight and made sure they were 
angled inwards a bit to give the truck a little more mean look. It's 
subtle, but seems to have worked.

I brought back my fuel tank fitting from the ranch this morning and 
so went ahead and installed it. I made a run to the auto parts store 
to get some fuel filters and speedo bulbs. I had to go to 2 different 
ones to get enough of everything.

When I got back I took the speedo out and cleaned it up. I swapped 
out all the bulbs and hooked all the wires up. They all seemed to 
work, except the turn signals. In fact, they weren't working at all. 
I got one little click from the flasher and then nothing else. I 
tried to chase the probelm for a while and had no luck.

I got frustrated 'cause everything HAD been working until I decided 
to mess with the speedo lights. So now I'm chasing turn signal 
problems again. I'm gonna get another flasher to make sure that isn't 
the problem. From there I guess I'll have to go to the turn signal 
switch. And of course make sure nothing on the speedo is causing the 
problem.

Bummer. Oh well.

I quit without even going back to hooking up the fuel lines. Just not 
into it right now. Maybe after a good nights sleep.
