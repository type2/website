It's nice to hear from people that are running Judsons.  I've been tempted to put one on my
59 double cab (I don't even know if it would fit....) but haven't been able to find out just how reliable they are.  

Are they OK in cold weather??
Can they be used in a daily driver??
Does your mileage really go down that much??

Does anybody else have any experience with Judson super chargers????
Pros and/or cons.

Dave
