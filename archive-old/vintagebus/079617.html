Sheesh.....
Look out for the Eurovan swerving all over the road with the tanked up
gringo behind the wheel....
All you newbies take note.....this is what happens to you when you're on the
list for too long...

BUS CONTENT: Traveled from Phx to Irvine last fall to see Neil Young's
Greendale concert.
I was about x beers into the Greendale CD and pressed the SEND button with no
response/feedback. Sorry for the multiple posts. Not sorry for the multiple
beers! =)

Newbies note: This list used to be pretty wild and fun. Now IMHO it's about as
interesting as reading the daily obituaries after the cat has soiled them.
Basically, I have made the transition from hypothetically being a member of
Vintage Transporters Only (shout out to my peeps!) to needing to form a new
club called Watercoolers Only to describe my driveway.
Total support and encouragement to those who continue to enjoy and pursue
aircooled buses.
