&lt;&lt; i have a 1600cc dp with headers and i was wondering if it is possible to
 take off the heat exchangers and have no negative effects. &gt;&gt;
Hi Adam,
The heat exchangers definitely help keep the oil temp cooler with the stock 
muffler on 1641cc or smaller engines.  With a header muffler that has less 
back pressure on a 1776 or smaller engine it would probably be not so much of 
a problem.  We know one fellow who likes to build 2 liter or bigger engines 
and again the stock heat exchangers cools better on his engines.  The header 
is also not a good thing for the bus 1641cc or smaller engine especially 
since it lowers your MPG and only provides extra HP well over 4,000+ RPM.   
Also unless you never leave S. Florida, you will always wish you had heaters 
on those long distance trips.  Brrrrrr!!   Eric&amp;Barb
