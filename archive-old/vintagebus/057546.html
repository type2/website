Subject: shift rod problem

--0-1287170304-1021691431=:13824


My friend's 66 standard had a shift rod failure. I guess some water had gotten trapped in the tube and rusted the middle part causing it to break. Does this happen often? Does anyone have one we could buy. I need the middle and front if possible. We're in Houston and need it asap! 

Anyone going to the Monumental Bug Bash on Sunday?



Thanks,

Brian
