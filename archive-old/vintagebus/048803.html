Subject: Home-made gas tank

Just thinking...

Has anyone ever made a gas tank? I was looking at the area for the 
gas tank for my '59 SC. As you know, you get to it from the storage 
area under the bed. When the gas tank is in place, there are some 
panels that keep you from seeing it. So I was thinking about making a 
gas tank to TOTALLY fill the area where it is supposed to be 
installed. Seems like I could get a pretty big more square tank in 
there that would hold more gas.

Again, just thinking out loud.
