Could you post the name of the manufacturer of this oil filter setup?

Why [and where] do you have to cut a hole in the fan shroud?

Also, is there a reason why the filter base and filter couldn't be located
somewhere more convenient by using proper oil-resistant plumbing?

Thanks.....

&gt;  There has recently(last couple of years) been a setup created by a guy in
Everett Washington that allows you to attach a spin on Oil filter setup that
attaches to the stock oil cooler location and sticks out through the lower
front part of the Fan Shroud.  &lt;
---------------------------------------

&gt;&gt;  I'm currently using one of these, and I'm pretty happy with it.  There
are a few issues:

1) It will only filter oil when warm.  Only oil that flows through the
cooler will get filtered.

2) The filters can be a bit of a pain to remove without getting oil on
everything.

3) You have to cut a hole in the fan shroud.
