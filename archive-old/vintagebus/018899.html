&gt; Need to make some room to tear apart my 56 bus.
&gt; 
&gt; 59-61 2/3 Middle Bus Seat   Jan. 09, 2001  Price:       550$  

I need a seat but $550??
and

&gt;***One end has been *SNAPPED*

Couldn't you find a place to store it? 
If it is worth over 5 big ones; 
sure thing the price will appreciate 
and you will be able to get
*even more* than your &quot;split seams&quot; 
broken &quot;Cash price is firm&quot; seat is worth now.
You're setting on a gold mine. Keep it!
Then you won't have to build that crate.

Where did that no name camper you posted pictures of end up?
Did you get you asking price for it?

A big Mahalo for offering the seat to the list 
before you offered it up to the gods of ebay.
