Subject: Running 1600SP engine FS Ohio

G'Morning All!
I have found a 67 bus which I MUST buy, However, I
just bought a new F*rd Expedition as a winter
driver\VW towing vehicle which sucked up all my
available cash! So, I am selling a running 1600 Single
port engine with a bus case (can be used for any
pre-72 bus, or any year KG or bug.)
By the end of next week, I will have the cash to buy
the bus, but I want to make sure it does not get away
before then, So if you can get me the cash by this
Friday, June 24, I will sell the engine for only $500.
That is a COMPLETE running 1600SP engine, plus all
cooling tin. I also have a selection of clutch parts
you can have depending on your vehicle.  I am located
just north of Cincinnati Ohio and I can hold the
engine for an unlimited amount of time until you pick
it up, as long as I get paid before Friday. If
interested, contact me ASAP, if nobody is interested
by Saturday June 25, then It goes OFF sale.

Peace, John Baker
