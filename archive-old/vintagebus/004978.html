Subject: Re: [VB] sealing the fuel tank, or not

I already tried POR-15's paint for sealing gas tanks. So far it has worked
great just like their original paint. No rust what so ever. You might try
exploring shelves at your Marine supply stores or some hardware stores as
well though. They might just have what you're looking for.


Good luck,

Andre


&gt; I pulled the fuel tank out of the Westy a few weeks ago. [cut] There's
some minor rust inside the tank though.  The
&gt; outside is fine, it was preserved by a thick layer of dust.
&gt;
&gt; I'm considering sealing the tank.  Considering because the FLAPS people
looked
&gt; at me like I was crazy when I started talking about fuel tanks and making
broad
&gt; sloshing gestures with my arms.  If I would have found something, I would
have
&gt; hauled off and just done it...but it looks like I have to mail order
whatever
&gt; I use, if I decide to do it.  I'm looking for some input, like what I
might use
&gt; to seal the tank, or maybe if I should even bother with it at all.
