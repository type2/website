Saw the pictures of that resto job.  Good job on Dan's bus!

&gt;        Take a look at Dan Kinsey's 58 Binz I built.  A lot of people had
&gt; plenty to say about me building my bus (bad stuff), but VERY few stood up and
&gt; said &quot;hey good job on Dans bus&quot;.  I think if you look at the pictures, you'll
&gt; also agree again, not many would have fixed and saved that bus the way I did!
