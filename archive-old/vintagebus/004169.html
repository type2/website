Subject: Re: [VB] one halogen bulb already burnt out

The UPS person may have been a big soccer fan !

I have a retail lighting store and bulbs(halogen or not)are a
big pain in the a#s. I'm surprised they will take them back !
Especially in Thom's case where both went out,you would think
it was a wiring problem.Electrical items are normally a final sale.However I
always replace them also. A good business
practice.
                    later,
                                woody



&gt; I bought a set of euro bulbs from Wolfsburg West, and both burned
&gt; out within a week!  I don't know if I got bad ones or what
