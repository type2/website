Subject: Re: [VB] dates for havasu and trick tow bar

If this is not available, my dad and I can measure,
weld and engineer our own folding tow bar.  He welds,
and I am good at preparing metal for welds, and
treating, buffing, and painting afterwards.  Actually
a really good team.  We even have the equipment. We
would need to know where the tow bars fabricated by
other people mount?  Is there one safe place all bars
bolt to?  Are they bolted to the beam, frame somehow,
or bumper brackets?  If to the brackets, I could buy
one already made available at camping stores where the
hinge part bolts to the bumper.

Hey Notorious, All I can add to this is not to do what I did! I wanted to
tow my '66 behind my motor home and could not locate a bus tow bar. I
bought a &quot;generic&quot; tow bar from JC Whitney that can be used on the steel
bumper of a Jeep. I towed a Jeep this way. Worked great. I was not going
to drill holes in the bumper of my bus, plus I felt the metal is too
thin. I had a weld shop fabricate a bracket that bolts to the frame where
the bumper also attaches. The bracket comes out from the frame and gives
me a place right in front of the bumper to attach the tow bar. I'm no
mechanical engineer, but this seemed like it would work. Well, while
towing, the front wheels would only turn part of the time. I know in some
towing situations that it is best to be rolling before you turn. Tried
that, no luck. I think the problem was because i wasn't towing from the
beam but from quite a ways in front. I towed my '66 bug 2K miles in one
trip and it towed great. So, I wasn't going to risk tearing up the whole
front of my beloved bus, so i bit the bullet and bought a tow dolly that
I can use on most any vehicle. Let us know how u make out.
LOL!
