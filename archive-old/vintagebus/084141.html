Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Gas Guage, Horn

Matt,

I've been monitoring the ohmage through the gauge sending unit for a couple of weeks now and at empty I get 28 ohms
and at full I get 4 ohms. This tells me that the sending unit is working properly. I removed the new VDO gas gauge and put back in the stock 6V gauge that was previously not working and now it seems to be working. I think the problem with the newer gauge is that it (gauge) was looking for far less voltage coming from the sending unit, this is why I surmise that the new cockpit style gauge was constantly reading full. I thought I had found a port on the side of the gauge that had some kind of adjustment in it but it did not work. 

Horn still doesn't work. This is after I had built up a mound of solder on top of the bottom piece of the horn button where the ground wire comes through. I thought this would do it because the brass piece that is set into the plastic of the bottom horn button piece is missing some brass as if the brass was broken off and the mound of solder would provide the necessary contact to the brass disk in the horn button. Once and a while I'll get it to honk but only if someone is in the drivers seat pressing the button while I play with the wires (new wiring for horn and new horn).
