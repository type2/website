Hello all, I just wanted to say Hi to everyone out there and to tell
everyone that I finally got a bus. Seems like I have been waiting for
centuries for the right one, and saving and waiting and saving. Well the
right one finally came along. I bought a 1965 21window deluxe. Its red
and white  and it is in a somewhat decent shape. The PO turned the bus
into a camper, I guess because he didn't have the middle or rear seats.
With a couple of phone calls I found some seats from a old rusty 23
window bus in Nurnburg. OH ya I live in Germany so finding parts is alot
harder for me then for all of the other listies,,I think. Well got the
seats and now probably going to get the delux trim from the 23 bus next
week. I just wanted to say I hope someone here can help me out when I
post a question or two. This is my first bus and it seems I have been
waiting so long to get this bus I don't want to mess it up. Here is the
stats as I know it, then my first questions to the experts.
The bus ran 6 years ago. The PO parked the bus in a garage and left it
there. 6 years later he needed to sell it to do some work on his house
so he put a new battery in the bus and kicked the engine over. He backed
it out of the garage. Not bad after sitting around for 6 years.
Question 1. What should I check first on this bus engine wise.
Oil,ect...?
Do to the uncertainty of the brakes which looked wet when I looked
underneath the bus, I plan on put the bus on a trailor instead of
driving it back to my house which is about 155 km away.
Question 2. After I get the bus home and washed off is their any thing I
should look at on the bus structurally underneath or inside before
putting it onthe road?
Question 3. If you had bought a bus today that had been sitting for 6
years what would be the first things you would do first to your new bus?

I know there will be more questions in the future so please just be
patient with a newbie ....ok.
Thanks for any help in advance...
