&lt;&lt; Someone told me that the front beam from a early Baywindow will fit under a
 67 . I would like , if possible , to put the disk brakes set up from my 71
 westy parts bus under my 67 westy. Is this possible? &gt;&gt;
Hi,
Will work, but will raise the front by 1 1/2&quot; or so.  This could partially or
completely be remedied by putting larger diameter tires on the rear than the
front.  Eric&amp;Barb
