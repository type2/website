Subject: Sway Bar Mounting

I'm hoping someone can help me out a bit here...
I want to put a sway bar on my 61 bus...original front beam.  I'd swap out
to a later beam for bigger brakes and a bar...but I haven't found one around
here just yet.
I pulled a sway bar off of a 78 bus beam.  I've seen bay bars mounted to
splits, the bar just hangs down lower.  Now, I don't remember what a sway
bar mounted on a split looks like.  I have the clamps and rubber mounts for
the bay bar, but I'm assuming I'll need to use the split rubber mounts and
clamps, correct??
The sway bar has a bolt hole on each and where it would bolt to the bay
window beam.  I'm assuming by split beam doesn't have holes for these to
bolt to, but on the split beam sway bars I seem to remember a clamp of some
sort behind the large rubber mount/clamp setup.  Where can I get these?
Will these work?  Does anyone have some they would part with?  I want to get
this beam on before I leave for my trip to Topeka in a week.

If anyone could give me some tips, that'd be great!

Thanks,
Isaiah
