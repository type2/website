Subject: Original US spec Headlight glass.  How was it marked?

Anyone have information on how Original US spec
headlight glass was marked?

I am looking for a single (maybe 2) pieces for my 1965
deluxe.  I have never really looked into the
differences though.  Anyone out there know what to
look for for the erra?

thanks
Matthew
