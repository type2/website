Subject: Re: [VB] changing lanes in my panel bus

&gt;while I am changing lanes from left to right I always put the signal on
and
&gt;ease her over gradually , incase any one is there we might only tap
them as
&gt;opposed to causeing a total collision  . IS THIS THE BRAILLE METHOD ???

&gt;does any one else have this problem?

I have used this method too, But I have my own variation. I swerve a few
times in my lane first to get the attention of those behind me and cause
them to think, &quot;what is this crazy lunatic up too&quot;? I then proceed over
very slowly. Only problem with this method is I once nearly got pulled
over for it.
