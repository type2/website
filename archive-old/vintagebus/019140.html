Subject: bbbv trip report

i've gotten the hundred of bus emails down to a manageable amount and now write my belated trip report....

other than the trauma of roger's bus breaking and later waking up mid-lane change, the trip to havasu was uneventful.  it was great to meet listees and put faces to text.  it was also great hangin' with the familiar crowd.  (p&amp;c, your sly tactics were much appreciated!  you will get your catfish!)  jp's transmission-winning raffle ticket was one number off of mine which was pretty funny - if he'd been more of a gentleman and let me buy my raffle tickets first... ah well.  haha!

the trip back was also uneventful other than at the same truck stop outside of barstow, my truck again wouldn't start just as when i was driving back from albuquerque.  i'd hoped to improve my experiences.  at least this time i had two strapping fellas to help push start my truck all the way back to monterey.

my truck won best single cab, which was pretty amazing to me as there were a lot of really nice single cabs at bbb though i think mine might have been the only one with bullet holes.  maybe that's why it won.  so now my truck has two awards and my shiny straight beetles have none.  haha!  maybe i should shoot those beetles up!
