&gt;Here's some pix of a '54 deluxe Lenny Copp &amp; West Coast Classic VW's did.
&gt;This must have cost an arm, 2 legs and a testicle...  &quot;If you have to

Very nice, I hope it is shown off so I may see it in person.

The upholstery job appears to be outstanding.

I refuse to go into vintage nazi mode, please consider me jealous.  :)
