Subject: Re: [VB] The talk about insanity...

Not worth $1500 to me. Maybe $100 or so, if you live close to it. It 
looks like it has a few good parts. If it does sell for $1500, then I'll 
have to sell my '64 Kombi storage shed.

&gt;So anyway, here is my serious, non-judgemental
&gt;question:  Is the bus in the following ad REALLY worth
&gt;$1500, even if someone is willing to pay that??
&gt;Heres the ad:
&gt;http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=283967
&gt;I honestly am not trying to say the seller is asking
&gt;too much or that it is out of line, I really want to
&gt;know if anyone would ever give $1500 for this bus.
