&gt;Yeah, the machine is the key - otherwise, you need a motor on a stand 
&gt;to put the dizzie in, run it and hit it with a timing light and a 
&gt;vacuum gauge.

I keep thinking that it shouldn't be that hard to make a dizzy machine.
You basically need a shaft that turns at various speeds, some kind of
&quot;TDC&quot; switch on the shaft, and a timer that has resolution down in
the tens of milliseconds range.

I haven't sat down and worked out the speeds but I think a typical
variable-speed drill would work pretty well for the lower ranges.
For higher speed you could use something like an old vacuum cleaner
motor with a light dimmer - you need speed but very little torque.
(Old vacuum motors are usually universal motors - light dimmers won't
work on other kinds of motors).

The points in the dizzy tell you when it fires, and then you need some
kind of switch on the motor shaft for &quot;TDC&quot;.  You can figure out the
RPM by watching the switch on the motor shaft, and you can figure out
the advance by taking the difference between the &quot;TDC&quot; switch and
the points at various RPMs.  Ideally you'd hook both switches to a PC
which could take the data and plot a nice graph.

You could do it without the PC if you hooked up a coil so an adjustable
advance timing light would work.  You'd still need the variable-speed
motor though.

Anybody got a distributor drive shaft with good upper part (drive slot)
and thrashed gear so I can test these theories?  :)
