&gt; Then starting in 61 or 62 up to about 65 or 66 there were two round poles

&gt; 65 or 66 on used stamped half moon shaped brackets with the two round poles.

Umm...I have a '65 and a '67 and both have crimped rounded end poles that are
bent to a 90 degree angle (at the ends) to fit into the A and B pillar
brackets.  I'm almost positive the poles are the same from 64 up to 67 in all
of the SO-42 kits.  Also, don't forget that these poles and canvas were stored
above the side cabinet (closet).  Yes they are too long and stick out (forward)
over the end of the closet.  That's why Westfalia stapled a boot with snaps to
the top of the closet to put the ends of the poles into.  The boot (made of the
cot canvas material) kept the poles from harpooning your passenger during
emergency stops.   Good thing too...those things would leave one hell of a
mark.
