Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Front Seat adjustment...

......Does anyone have any ideas or things they've done to modify it to work with 
longer legs/taller people? My 67 drives fine! ---- JD
 Is it an issue of bench seat
&gt; versus walk-thru?

I believe the bench seats in at least 60 &amp; earlier are closer to the
steering wheel than later.  I know that is the case between my 63 DC &amp; a 60
DC in any event. (seems to be about 2&quot; closer?)
.................

I guess you could modify the seat base to install a later 1/3-2/3 seat that the drivers seat would adjust back like later buses?
