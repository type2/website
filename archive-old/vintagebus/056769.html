&gt; It is better than a 009 from what I can feel when I drive it. The problem 
&gt; with the 019 and 010 is that the tune up parts for them are very expensive. 
&gt; $25+ for just the cap!
&gt; They can't be all that bad if that's what the &quot;real&quot; racers use in their 
&gt; cars. (010) 

Hi Sean,
Strange!  The cap used on the 010 &amp; 019 is the same used on the old German 
and modern Brazilian built 009s and can be had for less than $10.00.
