&gt;With the Classic just a month away I'm trying to figure out a way to save a
&gt;buck.  First thought that comes to mind is drive my crewcab down and find a
&gt;place to camp.  Any of youz guyz that have been before know of camp sites
or
&gt;camp friendly parking lots near the Classic?  Is anyone else planning on
&gt;camping out?  Hey Matt what are your plans?  Can't decide which bug to
take?
&gt;
&gt;Anyone from north of Lompoc going?  If so maybe we can hook up some place
&gt;and convoy.  As judge Mills would say &quot;LETS GET IT ON!&quot;  As Austin Powers
&gt;would say &quot;Yyyyeaa Baaaaabby!&quot;  ok ok ok ok  I'm done quoting.
