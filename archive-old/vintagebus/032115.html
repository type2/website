sorry, I didn't think about the trucks.  Ya they didn't get innies till 66.  

And I should be thinking about trucks.  I have all this stuff that needs to 
be moved, including a heavy 9 foot long couch, and a truck would be useful, 
easier than lifting a couch onto my buses roof rack, which is NOT goin to 
happen.
