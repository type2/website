Subject: Re: [VB] Heater box repair pipe

Hi Kevin,
The problem with the cheapie repair pipes is they have a much smaller inner 
diameter, because they are designed to be hammered into the old tubing.  This 
restriction in turn causes back pressure against the #1&amp;3 cylinders, which in 
turn causes the engine to run hotter in warm weather.  Best to weld on tubing 
that has the same innner and outer diameter as the heat exchanger pipes.  If 
you have a welder, or some place to do welding, cut off the rear 1/3 of the heat 
exchanger sheet metal and have the welder weld in new tubing so as to be 
inside the sheet metal and then weld back on the sheet metal.  If you have 
stainless steel tubing welded in place the weld area which will be still rustable 
will then be as protected from the elements as possible inside the sheet metal 
and the stainless steel will last just about forever even when exposed to the 
wet weather!!!  Also make sure the sheet metal is still tight or welded tight 
onto the heat exchanger pipes going in and out of the exchangers.
