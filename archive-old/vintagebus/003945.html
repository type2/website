How about SCRCT  (Super Creative Retrocustom Thing)?  I have the 73 Thingy i
have been attempting to resurrect for awhile now , as of this time i have
lowered the front 2 inches below stock and am getting ready to drop the back
to the same level. Body basicly stock and ugly, 4 lug all the way around
centerline style wheels, disc brakes in front, skinny tires , fat 295-50's
on the rear / tranny geared for 33 tall tires( PO doing ). Awsome outta the
hole but tops out at 55 or so( that craps gotta change). Engine 1640/ cam
and weber 2 bbl . Note  the engine and wheels are the ones that were on my
daughters Bradley GT we sold, almost 2 years ago. Anyhow this is my toy
persay, so you never know what i might do, I did put suicide doors on a bug
a few years back. pics on one of the showcase pages,(hmmmm suicide door
Thingy?),, sorry off today due to major sinuses, and ear infections, blame
the ranting on the meds.
(sounded like a good excuse to me ). Some body thump me i'm sounding like
ellis,  evil grin.
