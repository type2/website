  Personally, and I think most others would agree that almost 20 thousand is
EXPENSIVE for an un-restored bus.  What bus are you specifically talking
about selling for 45K??  As far as I know the green slider sat  untouched
for 40K as did Lenny's 54 at 50K.   Where are all the buyers for these?

It is true that as the awareness of the marquee has risen, people with
unlimited bank accounts will spend silly money for things/busses.  That
said, CHEEP and EXPENSIVE are relative things.

If that bus was CHEEP what is Elliss' BD....SUPER CHEEP????
