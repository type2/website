Importance: Normal

The pedal doesn't make a connection per se, in the manner of most cars that
use a limit switch that turns on the brake lights when the the pedal moves;
rather, the lightrs work off a pressure switch that senses hydraulic
pressure (the same pressure that actuates your brakes) so if your brakes are
working properly, the lights should work unless the switch has failed (or is
clogged).

I would suggest you remove the switch from the master cylinder and check it
for crud.  It is possible that when you bled the brakes, crud that had
settled in the bottom of the brake fluid reservoir got out and clogged your
brake light switch, so you might find that you can restore operation (at
least for a while) by cleaning out the fluid to the switch.  I have had this
happen, but my experience is that once the switch is crudded up, it becomes
intermittent until replaced.

Another possibility is that this is coincidence and by cleaning and
tightening the wire and contact at the switch, everything will return to
normal.

There are other, more coincidental possibilities, if I remember right.  I
seem to recall that the brake light power path is battery +, master cylinder
switch, turn signal switch, emergency flasher relay, then to the light and
ground.  If any of these connections are disturbed, the turn signals might
operate even if the brake lights don't.  I would still go after the switch
on the maste cylinder first.

Good luck,

James asked:
The brake lights on my 65 panel stopped working. Turn signals and tail
lights work. Bulbs are fine. I just adjusted the brakes. Could the pedal
not be making the connection anymore?
