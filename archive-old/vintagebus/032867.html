Subject: Re:  [VB] Restoring dash handles?
To: jelm2_at_yahoo_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I just got three dash/partition handles out of a pair
of 66 busses. One is really nice, the other two have
the typical browning, and cracked end caps (these are
the vinyl ivory or silver-beige handles like in a
deluxe).

Has anyone had any degree of success bringing these
back to the original color?
 ------- -
I ave soaked handles in bleach water with laundry soap.  worked for me.  

believe the handle is supposed to be the &quot;grey&quot; the dash knobs are.  looks 
white to me.  but not the yellowy ivory.   The white end caps (65-67)for some 
reason really fall apart, the black ones (62-64) dont have that problem.
