Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Questions about aftermarket stuff

I run H-4s on my 67. They work great. Never had a problem. Just make sure  
they are adjusted right. They are very bright and can cause more harm if  
blinding on coming traffic or the car in front of you. I'm in VA. Exhausts and  
colored lights seem to be the big cop magnets.
