Subject: 40hp rebuild

Rebuilding an engine for the first time, a mid '63 40hp. A few of questions:
I'm interested in adding a full flow oil filter. Where exactly do I tap the oil
galley to return the filtered oil? I can do this myself, right? Any tips?
Will the later 1600 &quot;doghouse&quot; oil cooler adapter fit the 40hp case? (I don't
have an extra adapter to try it myself.)
The Wilson book seems to push the idea of putting a 69mm throw crankshaft
(stroker in this case) in this engine. Before I dismiss the idea, anyone had any
positive experience with this?
Why am I going to all this trouble on a 40hp engine? I think it is pretty close
to what my early '64 ratwagen was born with. I have a second bus missing an
engine. I have heard the 40hp is a little tank, slow but hard to kill. Real
reason: I only had $18 and I wanted an engine, this one cost $15. What else
could I do?
Other notes:
I have a supposed barndoor mirror arm. I don't have a barndoor, will someone
with a barndoor please take this thing so I don't have to throw it away. It's
free.
Does anyone have an unneeded set of those 25tooth/18tooth reduction gears that
fit the 35mm diameter driven gear shaft (1.39:1 ratio but uses 46mm &quot;big nut&quot;)?
I just need the four gears, I'd like to buy them or trade them for 24/19 gears
(the 1.26:1 ones you probably think of as 46mm &quot;big nut&quot; and want if you are
trying to keep up with traffic).
