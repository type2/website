Subject: RE: [VB] engine, sp verses duel port

I talked to J.C. Whitney rep this afternoon and they say that the supplier
they get there new SP and DP heads says that they have 11,000 pairs of SP
heads. He refused to tell me the name of the supplier though. And George is
right, all of the new Mexican and Brazilian 041 DP heads ARE thicker and have
a longer reach plug hole. I measured one of my new ones to one of the old
heads on the shelf ready to goto rebuild.

With all of the rebuilds out there, I doubt that the SP head will go away
anytime soon. I still have a fresh set of 373's on the shelf along with three
sets of rebuilds.

 The problem with single port heads is that they have stopped making them
now. This is just a heads up to all you single porters out there to start
saving all your single port heads as new ones are NLA. It's pretty bad when
your suppliers (mine) tell me that they have bought the last of them and are
hording them now. If anybody is thinking of using NEW single port heads, if
you find them buy them before it's to late.
  On another note. All of the new single port heaads have the same valves in
them as NEW duel port heads.
  I am also in the process of rebuilding my 1776 single port engine (blew
the thrust bearing out of it (50,000 plus miles). To help solve the mystery
of duel port verses single port power, I have made arrangements to dyno the
engine. After I run it with the single port heads I am going to put a set of
duel port on it and dyno it with them also. I have duel Kadrons on it so I
am going to use the same carbs in both test. Hopefully this will let
everyone know the difference in torque and HP through the RPM range.

The Mexican DP VW heads come with long reach plugs, indicating thicker
castings.  I wonder if this might be aimed at reducing cracking.

One other place that cracks is the cylinder tin.  That can be brazed, but
the dual port tin tends to crack more than the SP tin, in my experience.

Still, since my bay came with DP, I'll stick with it.  I really doubt that
VW went to the all that trouble for a gimmick.
