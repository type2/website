  Tuesday, I got home from work and rolled Rosie out into the driveway.
Jacked her up and removed the wheel and brake drum. Tried to remove the
already damaged bearing spacer, but it was resistant. As a diversion I
removed the wheel cylinders, brake shoes, et al. Applied a torch to the
spacer and tried to turn it with water pump pliers. Some movement, but not a
lot. More heat, more twisting, more heat, etc. I succeeded in pulling the
spacer out about 1/8 in., but that was it. After several more futile
attempts, I got out the hacksaw. The only approach I could get was at the
outboard face of the spacer, so I started a cut parallel to the axis of the
spindle and as close as I could get to it  without going over the actual
retail price. Spent about 30 minutes sawing, sweating and resting. When it
appeared that I was very near to cutting through the spacer and into the
spindle, I applied the torch again, then more rotation, with no noticeable
outward movement. I then drove a chisel into the saw kerf and pounded until
the severed portion broke free. The spacer was now held with a very small
bridge of metal. A little more work with the hammer and chisel convinced it
to release.
  This is where owning a machine shop comes in very handy. I took the
remains of the spacer, the new hub and bearings down to the shop. I pressed
the races into the hub and then set about making a new spacer. Took about 45
minutes and it is every bit as good as anything VW put on our buses. Washed
the old grease out of the inboard bearing, which is being reused, closed up
and drove home. Had just enough time to reassemble the spindle/hub/wheel and
roll Rosie into the garage before dinner was ready.
  Oh, I made a drawing of the spacer, as it appears that they are NLA. This
is the one that goes inboard of the brake drum and provides the sealing
surface for the grease seal. If there is sufficient interest, we may
consider reproducing them. Requests and opinions welcome.
