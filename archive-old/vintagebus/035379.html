&lt;&lt; All this talk about carbs prompts me to post the following question, I've 
 got a 74 (#AK) DP 1600 with a adapter to fit a Solex 30/31 pict that I think 
 is what the stock 1500 SP should have. &gt;&gt;
Hi Eric,
You really need to change to a 34 PICT-3 carb for 1600 DP.  While you can 
make the 30/31 PICT work after lots of experimenting (Sounds like the pilot 
and main jets are probably too big and the air correction is way too small.) 
with differant jets it will never really give you the HP that the later carb 
will due to too small of venturi.  
 Is your 30/31 PICT the model with the manual choke cable set up on the left 
upper side?  If so we would be happy to trade you a good used 34 PICT-3 carb 
with jetting that should be close for your use and thusly should get better 
MPG.   Eric&amp;Barb
