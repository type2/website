Well a couple of you guessed (Geogre Lyle and Jon Crane) and they were both
right on track that this was some kind of clip meant to hold something up
like either a wire or a piece of tubing.

Where I found this piece was right between the tranny forks, clipped to the
sheet metal, supporting the brake line that leaves the T-fitting and crosses
over to the right rear wheel.  I've never seen one of these on any VW before
so I figured this must have been a part that usually breaks or falls off
during the life of a VW.  I'm gonna hang on to this and whip it out at
name-this-part sessions so I can win. :-)
