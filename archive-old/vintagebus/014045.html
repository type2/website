Subject: [VB] Windshield wiper mods?
Message-ID: &lt;19991119002736.2877.rocketmail_at_web608.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

 Heres the deal, on the '62 my wiper blades dont go
high enough for me. When drivin in the rain w/ the
wipers on, I have to duck way down to get where I can
see. (have to duck a little anyways, Im 6'3&quot;)
 Has anyone ever modified thier wipers to make em
reach higher? The normal response would be to get
longer wipers, but they cant be any longer on the
bottom or itll hit the body... Is there a swap out w/
a different VW wiper, or a &quot;GOOD&quot; fix that can be
done? The top part of the wiper needs to be 4 or 5
inches higher (havent actually measured it).
 Ideas.. suggestions... experience?
TIA... Later,

  I can have as many Damn VWs in my yard as I want. I
like to walk around the place with a Margarita in my
hand listening to Jimmy Buffet at 65dbs.... No one
complains.......
