I believe the same tool NQ refers to is the one I bought from JC Whimpey for
$29.95-their part # 88JE2792N-it comes with several different rubber bases
that allow it to be extremely adaptable-I can do the Kadrons also by using a
Tupperware container my wife donated.

Subject: Weber Carb Tool Info


&gt;I accidentally deleted a message from someone who made a reference to
&gt;getting some dual carbs and mentioned  me and my post I made in August
about
&gt;good and bad synchronizer tools.
&gt;
&gt;If you go to www.aircooled_dot_net and do a search for &quot;weber&quot; - you will see
at
&gt;the bottom of the page, the 2 carb tools I referred to.  I paid the $64
from
&gt;RMMW for the tool with the guage and number.  It's the tool that has a
&gt;conical looking piece of rubber on the end of it.  The other tool that is a
&gt;flat disc with the old ball and tube method is the one I hate.  It chokes
&gt;off your carb and you can't ever get a good seal.  The good one allows the
&gt;engine to breath and it doesn't cause it to stumble thereby allowing you to
&gt;make a very accurate measurement.
