I'm thinking about rebuilding my engine. How do I know what to order 
(sizes)?  Any preferences on what company I should get the parts from?  My 
problem right now is it is buring oil and I get low gas mileage. I want to 
get the oil problem fixed so I don't get my plugs so dirty and then 
hopefully the plugs will fire better and my mileage will increase.

I don't know much about the engine because there are no numbers to be found 
on the case. It is a DP. and I did see numbers on the cylinder heads 
once(inside the covers) but wasn't sure if those meant anything. Thanks for 
the help.
