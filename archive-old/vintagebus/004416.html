Robert sed:


&gt;I owned an early '65 Double Cab (VIN 265000987) so it had the earlier
church key &gt;style decklid with associated rear apron.

I have the church key type as well.

&gt;I don't recall it being any different than a regular bus rear apron.  I
think decklids and &gt;the catch for the decklid on the rear apron changed to
pushbutton midyear in '65, &gt;but that still wouldn't affect the apron itself.

The parts places, RMMW, etc. List a 66-67 apron. Apparently, the pre 66
aprons are NLA. It must be different somehow, right(?)

If anybody has a parts list, please help.

Steve Bradley
