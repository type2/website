Subject: Re: [VB] paint question

I used it on my '55 westy.  It was 'ok' as a far as paint goes.  Not as nice
as their CLV stuff, but it's an OK paint for those who are more 'price sensitive'
PPG has flattening agents for it, not sure what you're trying to accomplish.

&gt; about it.  is it urethane?  also does anybody know about using a flattening
&gt; agent with single stage.  thanks!
