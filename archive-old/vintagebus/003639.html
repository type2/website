I'm not wading into this for a street fight as Thom says, i'm just
commenting. I lurk and comment when something come up i know about, if i
don't know i keep my mouth shut, alot of people speak to be seen and heard
and i'm not one of them. I don't even own a bus other than for parts,
however i do own a couple Things, and have been invited to join the Thing
list, but i didn't. I feel its a privilge to be allowed to lurk on thie list
and will do so until i'm told i'm not welcome.
As for no imput from lurkers, there are alot of very knowing people lurking
out there that can one day provide you with the answer you need so beware of
knocking them, they have the choice not to respond to your plea.
As for the not imputing part of it also, i get questions daily sometimes 15
or more a day about things on my website or how i do things or my feelings
on how to do something. I answer ever single one of them, i might be slow in
doing it, but i do it. Do i get paid for this ,,,NO,  do i get repaid for
this in some other way, YES normally i do. In Karma or my reputation, and
both of these mean alot to me as does the quality of work and parts that
come out of my shop. I was posting to the list at around 12 am this morning
that the pages were updated, then i got up at 6:30 am and did e-mail. I have
answered e-mails at 2 am about parts orders. Does that classify as imput?
Well i think so ,,nuff said ,,i'm through.   redneck  soapbox mode off,
sorry  to the list for the band width,,later
