Subject: Gas Heater ? and 70 Westy For Sale Arnold, Md.
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey Gang,
vintage bus related material(see gas heater ?? below)
I am in the process of trading my daily driver 86 Golf
(POS) for a very straight red 70 poptop Westfalia. I
plan on keeping the cabinets and Z bed for restoring
my 67 camper but I am going to leave the the sink
(complete very nice) and camper light (this thing also
has a big round light between the front seats, looks
stock, very cool). The bus will need an engine and
bumpers (didn't come w/it) otherwise it is all there. 
It appears to have a gas heater, there is an apparatus
where the aux battery normally is, all sorts of
sheathing under the drivers side of the bus and what
looks like a stock green knob by the steering wheel. 
This van has a clear title and will be delivered to my
home next Weds. I would like to get $600 for the bus,
which is well worth it.  If you are looking to combine
2 campers this shell is really nice except for that
typical area where the front bumper is. The question I
have about the gas heater is, would it be a reasonable
idea to check out and put in my 67, if I keep the
heater stuff I will sell for $500.  Once I get
pictures I will put on the web, and will advertise for
higher price outside the list if nobody wants it.  I
am confident this bus could be sold for much more so
if you know someone who would like it, get it while
you can.  Will obviously need to be towed. As always I
will negotiate w/the right enthusiast. This van will
not be parted out, please save it. I wouldn't take the
camping stuff except I need it and it seems like
prices are way out of control. This bus has good
karma!  
Have a great 4th of July everyone, for those outside
the US have a great weekend also.
