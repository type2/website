Hmm,
Some rusty water, a Beatles casette tape, a mini maglite, some old pens and 
pencils, a french fry, the head to the dashboard hula girl, a parking stub 
from Candlestick Park (good riddance). A receipt from Lawsons Landing 
campground, The screws from Jen's vintage dresser and Misc nuts, fuses, and 
bolts. Nothing outrageous, kinda regular stuff I guess. Yawn. Boring actually!
