 Referring to going down long hills and over-revving.....  I feel somehow
 that when I am cruising down a long hill, even though I am traveling no
 faster than I would on a straight and level road, I am inflicting wear on
 the drivetrain.  Does the reverse compression braking practice (again...I am
 merely going 50-55 in 4th) cause undo strain?  I tend to lay off the
 brakes....I see the over-use of brakes as a sign of weakness, or
 something.....should I use more brake to fend off damage to that which makes
 my bus go?

I had done the same, using the motor to slow the bus down, then someone 
reminded me that changing a motor or tranny (well that's where the wear goes) 
is pricier than worn brake shoes, and more work to boot, and I use my brakes 
more now, being a cheap bus person.
