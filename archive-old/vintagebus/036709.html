&gt; My bus looks like crap.

My bus looked like crap coated crap until very recently. (From the pics on
your site yours looks like a trailer queen in comparison) 

After spending a lot of money and time on making it look pretty it goes no
better than before and I now cringe every time a car strays too near it or I
spot a new scratch from the other side of the car park.

The novelty of having a shiny bus wore off quite quickly and in retrospect I
reckon much of the money and time spent on the body would have been better
applied to a quality tranny rebuild and total front end overhaul.

My suggestion is that you carefully rustkill the holes and slap on a glass
fibre patch or two. Then enjoy driving the thing - with all the mechanical
work that you have done it must feel great. Leave the body for a while it
won't rot away immediately.

On a bus that gets driven daily the body will begin returning to a state of
crappiness soon after you put the spraygun down anyway.    

Take it easy and drink some Laphroaig single malt if you can find it. That
always works for me ;-)

Later
