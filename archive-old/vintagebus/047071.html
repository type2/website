Subject: Whiney Transaxle
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

the saga continues once again, yet I am determined to not loose faith.  I 
gotta do what I gotta do and learn from what ive screwed up doing.  So here 
is the latest development:

The trannsaxle whines now.  Only noticable in 3rd and 4th gears.  Let off the 
gas and the while goes away.  Press the clutch in and coast, no whine.  It 
has gotten rather annoying.

So Wade mentioned that he had the problem and it turned out to be the RGB 
bearings.  So outside I go.  Grab the drivers side wheel at 12 O'Clock, pull, 
clunk!
Passenger side seems fine.

So in your opinions could this possibly be an RBG issue?  The tranny acts 
just fine other than the whine.  Has oil!  I dont notice any unusual 
vibrations.  No clunking.

anyone?


ohhhh god, again?
some day ill end up a pro at this just from doing MY bus 50 times
