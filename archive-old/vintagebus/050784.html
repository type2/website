Well, im in the  throws of rewiring my 65 double cab. Of course, just
like when I rewired my Ghia , the blinkers don't work. The DC has a
different relay set up than my ghia so Im lost. Could anyone tell me
what wires should have voltage all the time? Does anyone know how to
test the relay's?  I hit the T/S switch and nothing happens. I currently
have constant hot to on pole of the canister flasher and one pole of the
remote relay. Moving the T/S switch does not change where the voltage
goes. The wiring has been checked against the wiring diagram many times
so I don't think I have any wires on wrong. The only part of the diagram
that isn't clear is the emergency flasher switch. It has no numbers on
it so I hooked it up in a way that seems logical. Anyone have any tips?
TJ
