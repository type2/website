Subject: RE: [VB] behind the trim panel...

   We drove a bus home 1500 miles and my buddy cleaned it out over the next 
few
days and found a few pipes. Lucky we didnt get pulled over. Since we had 
tags registered
to a honda, no ins, etc, it woulda been bad news. To tell you this was 
before 9/11:
  We carried on 3 bags. 1 of which containted, distrubutor, carb, wires, 
tools, fuses,
belts, gaskets, etc. We got some strange looks.  The lady at the security 
counter
was iffy on one thing when i said it was a 'fuel pump' but still let us on! 
Today you
would definately be in the back room somewhere getting searched hard and 
deep.
