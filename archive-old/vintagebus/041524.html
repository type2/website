&gt; Can anyone recommend a good tire in 185/75 R14 (or best choice) with a

&gt; action when being passed or on windy days on my fall trip out to North
&gt; Carolina  and back, I know some of this is normal for our busses but
&gt; have heard that a thicker sidewall helps.

You want 185R14, not 185/75R14.  The /75 size is too squat.

I like Bridgestone RD603, available  at firestone outlets.
You want load range C or D.

You can also use 195/75R14 in a pinch, but then you _must_ use a D-range
tire.  the /75s aren't as strong.
