What  problems? There are a LOT of high compression guys running copper head  
gaskets to improve sealing between the head and  cylinder.



Hi Eric,
Any time you increase the number of sealing seams one increases the chance  
of failure.  Most of the ones we have seen were made  of aluminum.  We do 
wonder how much the copper deforms.  Having  found one engine with pure copper 
instead of the copper plated steel  washers used on the sump plate.  The pure 
copper washers got a lot thinner  and spread out so much as to lock onto the sump 
studs.
