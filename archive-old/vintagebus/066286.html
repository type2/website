Subject: RE: [VB] CDI and necessary upgrades needed

Ronnie is correct on the &quot;P&quot; part.  This should help burn hotter at low RPM 
and cooler at high RPM.  Again this is an experiment.

NOPI was the only local place to carry them in Atlanta that I could find.  
This is not a plug for NOPI either.

The current wires I am using are the NGK blues.  I am fairly certain they 
are resistor/carbon wires.  Either way I think they have burned out.  But 
for a stock application they are pretty nice wires.  Then again for the 
money the Magnecor and Super Mag Plus wires are a better choice in my 
opinion.

Take Care,
Adrian

&gt;With NGK plugs the P mean extended electrode. The white ceramic tip sticks
&gt;out more then the same number NGK plug with-out the P. If it was BPR it
&gt;would be an extended electrode with built in resistor
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;ps. NGK also makes the plug wire you need. They are really cool see threw
&gt;blue wires.
