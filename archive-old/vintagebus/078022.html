Subject: Re: backing plate adhesive?

&gt; From: hejira &lt;mheron9517_at_rogers_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I am in the midst of trying to put the stock front drums brakes back 
&gt; together on my 65 bus.

Boy, do great minds think alike or what?  I pulled the front drums on 
my 65 today because the passenger side was binding.  The lining on all 
4 front shoes has a crack running down the middle (top to bottom), and 
on the binding side there's also a horizontal crack and apparently the 
lining was lifting from the shoe and binding the drum.  WTF??  Never 
seen that before.  Symptoms were a slight pull to the right, hot wheel, 
and a noticeable &quot;cinch&quot; when rolling to a stop on flat ground - ie, 
let up on the pedal and the car stays where it is.  ie, your usual 
binding brakes symptoms....

I'm gonna look for the receipt and if I bought these shoes at the FLAPS 
I'm hoping he'll take them back.  I think they were relined in Canada 
-- which brings me full circle back to Cousin It.  And without touching 
his subject at all!  Damn, I'm good.
