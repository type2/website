&gt;So I'm driving down the road last night about 9:45 pm (dark) and I decide 
&gt;to try to switch on my high beam headlights, as i flip the switch I lose
&gt;the headlights completely!!  When I hold the the switch toward me and not
&gt;release it I can get the lights to work sporadically.  

It could be that the high beams are out, but you should be able to get
steady low beams if that is the case.  From your description I assume
this is your '66 Bus.  I have a write-up on that (from an earlier 
question on the list) at 
http://home.att_dot_net/~mroberds/cars/vw-hauptlicht-2.html .  Start where
it says &quot;Long Version&quot; to run the whole procedure.

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
