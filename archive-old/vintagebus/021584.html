Subject: Re: [VB] westy rack length question
To: thom_at_calweb_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Thom,
FYI- all the other racks I've seen that are stretched long ones, use 5 or 6 
bows... aka combo of two racks... It would'nt be impossible, but I think the 
wood may have a greater tendency to bow imho? Another thing I've found out 
the hard way... don't work with you rack on the ground as your back will feel 
it for weeks:)... Kind of scary to say my back felt like an old mans, and I'm 
only 19:) 

Anyway, good luck and keep us posted... I'm digging your panel w/ all of you 
upgrades... You're giving me plenty of ideas for my '59 SWR panel!!
Have you put interior panels in your busses cargo area... I'm still looking 
for ideas as to what material to use w/ minimal drilling. ( Velcro is a great 
idea Isaiah gave me)

Thanks,
Pete

ps. to the list... I've still got a brand new PLF sundial tent for sale 
(red/white striped)
Open to cash /trades/offers... email me
-also still looking for an early westy interior for a small hatch bus
