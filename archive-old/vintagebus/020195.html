I never had a run-in with the law, but who'd want to
drive on the freeway w/ open safari's?  I have driven
with them cracked slightly (Ronnie, remember 107
degree Brawley?), but wide open would be a &quot;cop
magnet&quot; for sure.  And at freeway speeds, you get
plenty of air with a 1/2&quot; (sorry, Jon, 12.5mm)
opening.

&gt; I was wondering how many of you out there drive with
&gt; your safari's open and 
&gt; have had run-ins with the law about it.  I'm in the
&gt; SoCal area and I asked a 
&gt; CHP officer the other day about it and he said that
&gt; it was illegal to drive 
&gt; with them open and that if they saw me doing it,
&gt; they'd ticket me.  So I was 
&gt; curious if anyone has ever recieved a ticket for an
&gt; open safari.
