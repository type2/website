Hi - Great site. My fiance's dream is to one day own a 67' split window. We
can't afford that right now, but we are getting married in September and I
thought it would be a great surprise if I could rent one (with driver) for
our wedding day instead of the traditional limo. The wedding will be in
Akron, Ohio. Do you know of anyone in the area with a bus like this? If it's
not a '67 I'm sure he'd understand :) Or if you have contacts in other
states that you think might be of some help I'd love to get in touch with
them. Thanks!

- Bethany Tipton
