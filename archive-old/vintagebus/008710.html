My 61 ambulance is allso equiped with the same type squirters as you
describe.
This bus was bought from the norwegian army in the early eightys, but was
left in someones garden until 95 when i bought it.
Is these squirters an OG/ ambulance thing? The mounting holes in the car
looks factory like. M code?

&gt; I noticed the squirters that shoot fluid on the windows were make of a
&gt; little flat chrome or stainless steel disc with a tiny brass fitting on
the
&gt; side which could be adjusted with a wrench to aim the fluid properly.  The
&gt; only squirters I ever know of were the elcheapo plastic ones you aim with
&gt; pin.
