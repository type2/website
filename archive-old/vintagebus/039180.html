Greetings list,

Anyone out there know where I can get a pattern for the canvas and a
drawing for the hoops for my doublecab? Failing that some good close up
photos would be good. I have dozens of magazine photos of double and
single cabs with canvas in place but none are closeup enough to make out
any real detail.

I made up a frame and a canvas canopy that look like crap cos I was
cheap. Used square tube for the frame and synthetic canvas - pooh.

TIA

Michael - 60 doublecab
