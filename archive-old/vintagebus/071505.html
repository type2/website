Subject: Re: [VB] Westy cot in non westy

&gt; Any reason a telescoping style bay cot would not hook into the split style brackets? If the poles are
adjustable in length, I don't see a problem other than a little bunching of the canvas unless the brackets are
not compatible. I want to install the early style brackets on the off chance that I find a correct cot but
would like to use a bay style for now since that is what is readily available. Is this do-able?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Should do-able on the bars. The split front bar is 47&quot; long. The 76-79 2 piece bars, collapsed, are 46&quot; long.
[split rear bar is 55 1/4&quot; long]

But you would need to cut the canvas. Bay canvas is 55&quot; wide. Too much to bunch up.
