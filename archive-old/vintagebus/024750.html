&gt;  the pins that are currently in the hinges are completely
&gt;
&gt; rusted in.  I have attempted to knock them out but no luck.  Instead, I have
&gt;
&gt; decided that my best bet it to find a set of hinges for both front doors
&gt; andsimply swap them out with the existing ones.

        I have luck using a air chisel with a pointed bit.Lots of penetrating
oil,and warm the hinge up with a torch,carefully.There tough to break loose but
I have gotten them out this way.wear goggles.Good Luck.        Jeff Woodall
