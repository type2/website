Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p


From: &quot;Chris Sullivan&quot;
&gt; I've started driving my '65 every day and wondering:  anybody else have
&gt; trouble seeing through the front window?  I'm 6'2&quot; and my eye level is
&gt; even with the top of the window unless i bend myself into a question
&gt; mark.  Hard to see the signal change....

 Chris,
I am 5' 12&quot; and I have the same problem with my 66 and 67. Both are
non-walkthru's. I had a 67 walkthru that I did not have this problem
with.....I should have kept that one.
I drive my 77 Westy almost everyday.

PS....I have that hinge pin if you still need it. JP was correct, type3's use
the same pins.
