Subject: Re: [VB] NICE Shifter extension for sale
Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Isaiah is right, I took a close look at Dan's shifter extensions last
Sunday at the KC Kombies garage tour, and I will have to say he has done a
REALLY GOOD JOB at repoing these.  In fact, of all the &quot;original&quot; ones that
I have, his is a much better quality.  These things are nice!!  And he
didn't cheapo out on the material, 6061 HIGH grade aircraft aluminum.  I am
surprised that he is making any money on these with as much work as what
has gone into them.

I too have picked up extensions pretty cheap at swap meets, but you won't
find a better one at the price!  (I really do hate to give Dan this much
credit)  The old shop teacher gives two thumbs up for this one.

And on a second note, the garage tour was a lot of fun, we need to do more
of these.  Dan's wonderful wife had even whipped up some great buscuits and
gravy to start the morning off.  A lot of good bus conversation.  Great to
renew old friendships and get everyone &quot;pumped up&quot; for the upcoming camping
and show season.  If your local bus group hasn't done one of these, you
ought to try one!



&gt;You must remember though that not everyone gets to go to all these
&gt;dreamland swap
&gt;meets.  I don't think that 25 is a bad price really.  The price includes
&gt;shipping
&gt;and all which I would estimate to be about $5.  He went through the trouble of
&gt;making them and making them look nice...give the guy some credit...geez!
&gt;
&gt;Anyone want to step up and sell me a shifter extension for $1???  I'd like
&gt;to see
&gt;that happen!
&gt;
&gt;The guy goes through this trouble and all you can do is insult his price
&gt;by saying
&gt;how good of a deal you've gotten on other ones?  Some of you get free
&gt;buses even!
&gt;Does this mean that all of them should be free??
&gt;
&gt;the nerve of some people....
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; I'd prolly get my butt kicked if I mentioned I've bought originals at
&gt;&gt;swaps
&gt;&gt; for $5 including the bakelight knob. &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; damn, I dont think Ive paid more than a dollar a piece!
&gt;&gt; I remember once when my friend had 20 of these end to end in his highroof!
&gt;&gt; Now that was cool!!!!!!!
