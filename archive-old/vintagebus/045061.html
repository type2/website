I was doubting the power of the 1600 dp
that is in my 65 double cab , until 
I saw the previous owner about a month ago and he said 
in discussion that he had the double cab loaded with 
nearly one ton in the back of the pick up 
he described it as 25 bags of quickcrete
and a load of gravel on the back side of it .

he claims that it was roughly 1800 lbs. of weight
can this possibly be trude he also stated that it was not a problem when 
he had to stop at the red light at the  bottom of the steep hill in town 
claim is that it just went right up the hill   ?   imagine that ?
