Subject: WTD: Copies of Bentley semephore stuff
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19990705150247.007a3920_at_mail.flashmail_dot_com&gt;

Does anyone out there have any early Bentley or shop manuals that cover
semephores? If so, I'd like to try to get a photocopy or scan sent to me.
Let me know if you do and I'll work out something with you to cover your
time and costs.

BTW: Is it &quot;semEphore&quot; or &quot;semAphore&quot;?
