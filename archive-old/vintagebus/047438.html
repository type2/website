I've got a 21 Window bus for sale that I need to get out of my yard.   The 
good news, the top mechanism is complete, and all the roof widows are there 
and good.  The bad news is everything else... no title, no other glass, no 
bulkhead, wheel wells cut (rear), HUGE american car taillights, etc. etc.

I've gotta get this thing out of my way, but I am aware that I could get more 
by parting it out.  Anybody want to keep it in one piece?  It's located in 
Albuquerque, New Mexico.  (It does roll, but I might need the wheels and 
tires.)

Let me know soon, I'm going to put it on Everett's page soon, but you guys 
have the first shot.

JP
