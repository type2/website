For me, it's the dog days of summer...

Returned home from work in the F-150 the other day.
Another day of Point A to Point B, Point B to Point A
with an RCH of feigned Aerospace employment and
helicopter noise in between. Melting concrete freeways
at 70 mph and getting passed on both sides like I was
site seeing~ or driving a splitty on both legs of the
daily journey. Phoenix drivers travel like their hair
is on fire. This town is now commonly referred to as
LA in the microwave. No surfing unless it's on
heatwaves. The incontinent transients and the ever
increasing numbers of illegal amigos haunting the
Circle K Stores don't seem to grasp that humor. No
comprende! ¿Dígame por favor, dónde los trabajos son? 
Beats me Julio, I'm looking too! When the ex-yuppie
dot-gone California refugees hear that tired old
Phoenix-microwave comment they just smile and continue
to silently sack the groceries and nod so as to not
get fired- again... Stock options my ass, they should
have sold short and taken the cash...
Anyway, the local TV station, &quot;3-TV, The Place with
more Chicks&quot; was mentioning an airport temperature of
120f. We basically live at the airport judging from
the ever incessant helicopter flight path noise. Paula
went out side to fire up the '67 Dormant Camper. She
insisted on letting it run a few minutes so the
battery wouldn't go dead. I figured whatever floats
her boat is fine by me as long as I don't have to bail
or row. She eventually came back inside. &quot;Damn it's
hot outside,&quot; she said. I agreed and had her give the
daughter another lesson on fetching cold beer without
shaking or dropping. I remember asking who's your
Daddy like it was a &quot;Pop&quot; quiz or something. I'm still
trying to figure that one out. At least she can carry
12 ouncers on occassion. Tom Browkaw was coming on and
the pot pies were all most done... I made a vague
promise to fix the steering box and K&amp;L's when the
next boat comes in, when I get past this layoff notice
or if we hit the California State Lotto. Paula didn't
seem to hear me because of the 3-TV helicopter leaf
blower in the sky noise. Just the same I'll probably
get to it before nice bus driving weather hits again ~
in January. It ought to be down to 80f by then. In the
meantime, I'm thankful for the Ford, the CD player,
Merle Haggard's &quot;Chill Factor&quot;, and any air
conditioning that I can find. 

It's the dog days of summer. There ain't NOTHIN'
air-cooled in southern Arizona right now. Just a lot
of hot air...
