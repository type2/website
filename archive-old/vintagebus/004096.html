&gt;My favorite tools for rust removal are sand, chemicals, and elbow grease.


no palabrotas in english/spanish/russian?  ;)

&gt;I don't think the sacrificial anode thing will work on anything other
&gt;than the smallest of parts.


it stands to reason that it'll work on something larger if it works on
something smaller. might need something other than a small battery charger
to do that in any reasonable time, though...
i used to think that the cathodic vehicle anti-rust systems needed to be
shelved with the gas line magnets and gas mizer 2000's and the rest of that
stuff...
along similar lines, i am told that Mg bars are buried with metal pipe to
act sacrificially and get eaten before the pipe does.... might start up a
business with those bad engine cases...?
if you think that's bad... try derusting an abandoned missile silo ccomplex
full of water:

it'll at least make you think your bus isn't quite so bad off...
(just think of the POR-15 bill...)
