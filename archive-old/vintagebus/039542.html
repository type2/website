All this bickering about the new bus is about making me sick. most of you 
people are sooooooo stubborn. HELLOOOOOOO... IT IS THE YEAR 2001 and 
Volkswagen, like ANY OTHER AUTO MANUFACTURER is looking to put people in 
their cars. would you rather they not even be in business any more? 
**Oldsmobile** nobody can deny that the new beetle was a success. SO WHAT IF 
VW PLAYED ON THE NOSTALGIA CARD!! my wife has one, and the ride and quality 
is like no other sub $20k car out there. my '93 Passat is nice, totally 
loaded and fast... $28k new... did i pay that, NOOOO, i got it 3 1/2 years 
ago. its like you people cant accept what things cost today... get a grip!! 
i can just imagine what its like living with some of you... constantly 
complaining about life today and the prices and the government and whatever. 
thom especially. sorry... i said it, so what! (but thats whats great about 
america, right)

if i lived in &quot;aridzona&quot;, i would drive my bus 365 days a year. but i cant, 
and i wont. so, i have been thinking about a water-cooled 80's Westy. but 
anyway, it would be great to see those &quot;New&quot; Microbuses driving around. 
better than those Astro vans! i would feel that much cooler pulling up next 
to one in my 35 year old bus at a light! and, when i could afford one, i 
sure the heck will buy one!!

Dan summed it up pretty good:
&quot;It will be differennt from most other minivans, which was always VWs forte.

Will it be as cool as my double cab or westy?  Probably not.  WOuld I buy an 
(affordable) one for a daily driver?  You Bet!!&quot;

talk to ya later... maybe... if thom doesnt bounce me
