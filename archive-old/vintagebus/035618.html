&lt;&lt;  My wheel has some drag now even with the shoes backed off.&gt;&gt;
Hi Eric,
The rear wheels always have a little drag to them due to being connected to 
four bearings, RGs, and even the differential.

&lt;&lt; I just stuck the outter bearing and used the 4 nuts to tourqe it down.  Is 
it easy to get the outter rear bearing put in out of allignment?&gt;&gt;
Not really.  If you have no leakage to speak of the bearing must have seated.

&lt;&lt; I ended up putting a gasket on the outer rgb case and 2 between the 
backing plate and 4 bolt casking thing under the adjusting stars.  I put a 
small rubber donut seal on the axle stub on top ofg the 4 bolt casting.&gt;&gt;
If you mean this O-ring seal is on the stub axle just inside of the drum and 
outside of the lower outer roller bearing then that is fine.

&lt;&lt;add put a big washer under the 46mm bolt. &gt;&gt;
We do not know of any bolts that size.  Guess you mean the 46mm axle nut.  
The washer you installed is for the type 1s and 1955-63 type 2s.  Will 
probably not cause a problem where you installed it, but we suggest you 
remove it next time you remove the brake drum.
Hopefully you got everything torqued properly.  You really need to get a 
Bentley reprint of the 1963-67 VW shop manual!    Eric&amp;Barb
