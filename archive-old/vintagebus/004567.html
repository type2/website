I have just purchased this kit. It uses (but does not include) rotors and
calipers from a '73-'79 bus. These being readily available at your favorite
local junkyard, they deemed it cheaper for you to obtain them elsewhere. I
will post my impressions once I have finished the conversion. Don't hold
your breath, it's over 100 degrees F right now, and summer is just
beginning. I'll get to it when I'm d*mn good and ready. Oh, yeah, thanks to
Karl von Salzen from the Type 2 list for procuring and shipping my rotors
and calipers. Now, where did I leave my checkbook?
