Subject: powder coating vs POR15 - cooling tin

hi gang

Im just ready to paint my cooling tin for my engine, and i was going to use
black POR-15 on it , but i wonder if its not good for the engine cooling as
POR15 seems thicker ??

Maybe then i will look for Powdercoating instead, but if its no harm to the
engine i bet it will be a lot less expensive using POR-15.

tx for any input

mike
