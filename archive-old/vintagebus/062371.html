Subject: RE: [VB] Dual circuit master cylinders

I had thought about using the slightly cheaper bug master cylinder but then
discovered that the pistons were way too small for truck under load. My 67
dual circuit had 22mm pistons and the late model bus has 24mm pistons, more
pressure to make sure that I can stop! I used a bug master cylinder on my
trike, but then it weighs 1/3 that of a bug and doesn't require as much.

&gt; Why not use a late beetle master? I dont know about the oldspeed kit but
it
&gt; works great with stock brakes. Some will say it is too small but it a
&gt; helluva lot better than the old single circuit.
&gt; as for reservoir, use one from a Volvo 240 if the reservoir holes are big
&gt; and one from a rabbit if they are small. Credit to Mark Dearing for this
&gt; info.

Didn't even think about that.  How small is it then?  Oldspeed are trying to
use this Golf/Jetta mc with a beetle with 944 brakes - so I would assume it
probably is a bit small for this application.
It would probably be good for my friend though (I help him with mechanical
bit he helps me with paint and body stuff).  
What is needed to fit this to the bus?

Thanks
Paul
