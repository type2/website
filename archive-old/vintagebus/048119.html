 &gt;Are all engine bays painted black?
 &gt;
 Commercial vehicles are primer in the engine bay, I believe, up to a certain
 year.  My ex-'63 SC was white, my ex-'60 SC was factory-looking primer.
 
 Someone correct me if I'm wrong, my '55 was a pleasing Gold tone.  Original
 owners probably thought it reflected heat better or something.
 
 Gas tanks are grey.  Barndoor tanks are black, mine has &gt;5 coats of paint on
 it.  Gas likes to be cozy in a paint blanket. (Sounds like a Claraism)

gee thanks Everett I guess :).   ya bd gas tanks are black.  forgot about 
that.  With AUF , ZU , and RES on them to indicate how to flip the reserve 
lever for those functions.   but the 54 kombi had dove blue in the engine 
area (much nicer than outside dove blue) and the 53 has the light beige that 
was painted on the lower half when it was new. 56 deluxe had SWR EC. I have 
seen a 67 with a bright metallic purple engine bay.  someones idea of kewl.  
had a 59 sc with the dove blue in theEC, my first splitty had the SWR in the 
EC, but was aqua on the outside,  actually have never seen any thing that 
didn't look like it came originally bottom half of bus colour when new.  But 
what about those buses &quot;delivered in primer&quot; what did the OOs do with them?
