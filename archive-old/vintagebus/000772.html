Hi David,
Up to about the end of 1960 production the front doors had pockets in the 
door panels.  The chruch key was usually kept in the drivers door pocket.  
Then 1961ish the pockets were discontinued, and a small steel zinc plated 
bracket held the church key on the left of the left front kick panel.
