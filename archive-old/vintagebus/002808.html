Subject: Replacement Panel Recommendations??
Date: Mon, 11 Jun 2001 22:45:53 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Just checked the Archives and didn't fins any recent answers.  Anyone used
any replacement panels lately and would recommend one company over the
other?  I looking at, R- Rear/Front Outrigger, R and L Rockers, R and Left
Inner Rockers and Right side Cargo floor repair panel.  Thinking of the
R-Side Cargo Floor Rocker combo.  Prices are close from everyone (Bus Boys,
Bus Depot, Rocky Mountain and Wolfburg).  Any suggestions??
