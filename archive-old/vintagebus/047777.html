&lt;&lt; Is it that fuel seeps past the float
 valve unless pressure is reduced?  I drive my 67 Westy every day so I'm
 wondering if maybe I should get on my bike until I fix the fuel problem- I
 lost one bus to a fire in the engine compartment.   &gt;&gt;
Hi,
Yes the excess fuel pressure pushes the shut off valves open and flood the
engine.  You might end up with a fire, but more likely you will wash the oil
off the rings and ruin your cylinders and thin down you oil.   Eric &amp; Barb
PS are you using a electrical or mechanical fuel pump?  With the electrical
you use a regulator and with the mechanical you set the fuel pump and rod
properly to get the right pressure.  EEE&amp;B
