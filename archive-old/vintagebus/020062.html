&gt; This is to let you know that in the background there have been a batch

&gt; changes recently in the non-structure that is type2_dot_com.

I want to thank Steve Dolan from the bottom of my heart for all he's 
done for us. In addition to being a superb admin, Steve has been 
carrying a GREAT DEAL of the site's financial burden for a very long 
time. I'm not supposed to tell that but I don't care. Steve is a man of 
wisdom and grace and judgement and incredible generosity, we are very 
lucky to have had him for as long as we did.

&lt;snif&gt;

Yet more shakeup: Matt Roberds has consented after much prodding to 
assume my post as Neglectful Webmaster. Type2_dot_com could be a much better 
resource than it is, and there's some very talented new blood out there, 
so I'm admitting that it can be done better and we're taking advantage 
of these young bucks before they change their minds.

Matt is also taking over maintenance of the type2_dot_com Library section 
from Sean Bartnik, who thought he has enough to do with his list 
administration, and he's right.

I might be talking out of school but my understanding is that Tom Tarka 
is going to take on the fourth list admin spot, and he seems to have 
adopted the archive project as well (we know it's broken, bear with us, 
it's being worked on). Welcome Tom!.

I know it gets to be a bit much to keep track of, especially if you're 
new, so here's a quick rundown of who does what. We stand on the 
shoulders of giants, but this list does not include people whose 
contributions are in the past, this is the current cast (hope I don't 
miss somebody):
