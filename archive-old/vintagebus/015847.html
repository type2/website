From Richard Troy on the KG list

As an aside, one of the barely-pubescent punks started cranking 
the boomin' tunes in a ratty-ass beater bug (prolly had more into
the stereo than I do in my westy) and one of the event staff *RAN* over
and shut him down.  Had to love that!

&gt;It was nice to see so many KG folk at the Kelley Park show...
&gt;
&gt;As one of the people who helps put on the show each year - this was the
&gt;first year in _ten_ that I didn't work the show - I can comment on all
&gt;this. The very short of it is that this is the first year that we have
&gt;actually had to turn anyone away. In years past there weren't any
&gt;water-pumpers - maybe one New-Beetle on display - and they surely
&gt;contributed to the lack of space inside. Also, in years past we were able
&gt;to put overflow on the grass across from the hotel (behind the Ghias).
&gt;This year, somehow they had NOBODY (that I ever saw) parking Ghias, and we
&gt;overflowed it, and normally we'd have overflowed onto the grass behind.
&gt;But there was no room on the grass as some dope-head had permitted the
&gt;setting up of awnings directly behind the cars. Doah! ...It may have also
&gt;been true that they, the city, wouldn't let us park on the grass...
&gt;
&gt;There were quite a few screw ups this year. One was the use of entrance
&gt;gates. In years past the swappers used the north-gate. This time we
&gt;weren't allowed to use it because of the in-experience of the people who
&gt;now manage the park for the city. They were, in short, unwilling to listen
&gt;to us when we told them, &quot;this is how it's been done in years past -
&gt;because it works; please let us do it that way again this year.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Quite a few of us were talking openly at the show of moving it to a new
&gt;location - we've out-grown the location and the citys new Kelley Park
&gt;managers are difficult to deal with, with unreasonable demands borne of
&gt;ignorance. I have proposed, and will at the next meeting will formally
&gt;propose our use of &quot;Farie Land&quot; on the edge of Lake Merrit in Oakland.
&gt;It's got the trees and charm of Kelley Park, and it's much bigger. I've
&gt;already been talking with the city about it as a place for Ghia people to
&gt;hold gatherings... We'll see what they tell us about using it. My bet is
&gt;that they'll be DELIGHTED to &quot;steal&quot; this money-maker from San Jose! And,
&gt;a whole lot of us will like the location a lot better. It'll be cooler,
&gt;closer to services like ATMs and regular resturants - you can easily walk
&gt;to a few dozen resturants for lunch, for example, and it's more centrally
&gt;located for Bay Area people... In fact the ONE reason it might get
&gt;shot-down is that Fearless Leader lives in Gillroy, an hour plus south of 
&gt;K.P. and Farie Land is about an extra 45 minutes to an hour north of
&gt;that... He has been known to discourage and quell anything happening any
&gt;further north than S.J. - and this, from the &quot;Golden Gate&quot; Chapter? Maybe
&gt;they should re-name it the Garlic Gate Chapter!
&gt;
&gt;Oh, while _I'm_ ranting - did anyone else notice the WRONG model name used
&gt;for Karmann Ghia Coupes on the parking signs? They said, &quot;Karmann Ghia
&gt;Sedan&quot;. Nope. Sorry. No such animal exists! I have brought this up a few
&gt;times and it has never changed. If I can get a few of you to reply that
&gt;you support the re-making of the sign to read correctly, I could use your
&gt;replies. ...There were some other afronts to Ghia owners too. Anybody
&gt;notice that the car on the t-shirt and artwork wasn't much of a stock
&gt;Ghia? Four lug wheels on a five lug era car, custom bumper, etc. When I
&gt;brought it up, I was told, &quot;oh, I didn't notice - don't know too much
&gt;about Ghias.&quot; - this from the pres. of the club. ...Oh, and that's the
&gt;EXACT SAME remark that was made about the mis-printed sign... -sigh-
&gt;
&gt;Please send me all your SPECIFIC feedback on this topic. I plan to
&gt;champion the Ghia cause as best I can at the next meeting.
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;RT

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Just got back from Kelley Park.  A great show, lots of cars.  The problem?
&gt;&gt; Lots of cars.  I left Sacramento at 5:30am, with a couple of vintage busses
&gt;&gt; (Thomn Fitzpatrick's) tagging along.  Got to KP at about 9:00 to find that
&gt;&gt; the gates were closed to more cars.  *I* could come in, but I had to leave
&gt;&gt; the Ghia outside.  The Ghia that I'd just spent 2 days detailing for this
&gt;&gt; show.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; No sooner than I had parked my car and walked back to the gate than I saw
&gt;&gt; the mighty police and gatekeepers seeing fit to allow a red Ghia coupe in.
&gt;&gt; My inquiries as to why this particular car was allowed in and mine wasn't
&gt;&gt; were not met with much amusement.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The bottom line to me is this:  This event is BILLED as the &quot;Kelley Park
&gt;&gt; *Vintage* Meet&quot;.  Why are stock, vintage cars forced to park outside while
&gt;&gt; assloads of New Beetles, Golfs, Jettas, Superbeetles, and Cal-look Bugs wih
&gt;&gt; &quot;boomin' systems&quot; allowed in?  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Something needs to change, VVWCOA, and soon.
