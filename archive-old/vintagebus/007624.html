I bought a nearly identical tent to the one on e-bay, almost as good
condition, it was complete and had only been used a couple of times.
I paid $2,000.00 for mine, but it came with the &quot;Westfalia camper&quot;
accessory.

&gt; Nice for who Jim?  Obviously the gentleman selling it.  Get this, he told
me
&gt; he bought it at an estate sale.  I got the impression it was under 50
&gt; bucks.  He almost didn't find the corner brackets.  Went back two days
later
&gt; and found them in a drawer.
&gt;
&gt; I am thoroughly depressed.  There I no way in hell I'll ever convince
myself
&gt; to pay that kind of money for an accessory.  I'd be hard pressed to spend
&gt; 600 for a used one.  I think the high bidders ID says it all!
&gt;
&gt; Anyone on the list bid that dumb thing up.  When are people going to stop
&gt; incrementally bidding on things  multiple times???   You're just driving
the
&gt; price up for yourself.
