I read an article in Popular Mechanics and in Road &amp; Track some years 
ago and discovered ALL oil is basically the same. Although some are more 
synthetic than others. (And it is debateable whether or not synthetic 
oil is any better for your engine anyway, definitely not better for your 
wallet) As long as the oil has the little ASI Approved circle, star 
thing on the bottle it's good stuff!
