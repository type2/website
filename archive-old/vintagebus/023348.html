&lt;&lt;      I consider myself a true VW enthusiast; I sold a fellow VW owner 
something he could use (or so I thought)  for REALLY cheap to help him out. &gt;&gt;

A fellow listmember sold me a bus (56 westfalia) dirt cheap cause' I told him 
I was gonna restore it.
Anyone want to buy it? Is 100,000.00$ fair?

rebuild, tranny rebuild, new brakes, new tires, paint, rubber, interior 
resto, frame rebuilding.
