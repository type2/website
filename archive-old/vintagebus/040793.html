&gt; Anyone see the &quot;NOS&quot; 28 PICT carb currently at $250.  My question:
&gt; why is the &quot;VW&quot; logo on the side machined off?  My first hunch is that
&gt; this is a send-back.

It probably means that the carb was sold directly by the manufacturer (i.e.
to an auto parts distributor) rather than by VW through their dealer
network.  If a company is an OE supplier to VW, but also sells the same part
themselves, they are often not permitted to use the VW logo on the units
they are selling directly. It is much cheaper to grind the logo off than to
have two sets of tooling, so that's what many companies do.  Not that the
part couldn't be a send-back etc., but the scenario I describe is much more
likely.
