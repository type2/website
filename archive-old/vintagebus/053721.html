Subject: RE: [VB] Ordering from Bus Depot??

&gt; I learned to call Bus Depot directly, instead of their order hotline, to
ask
&gt; specifically if what I wanted is in stock.  The last couple times I've
called,
&gt; almost everything I wanted was out of stock, so at least I saved myself
&gt;  the aggravation of ordering and then waiting long periods of time to get
my stuff.

It's true that you are better off calling the customer-service (non
toll-free) line, as it will get you someone who is qualified to do more than
just enter part-number-and-quantity.  The toll-free line is strictly for
someone who wants to provide quantity and part number and has absolutely no
questions other than that, and the people who answer that line are trained
accordingly.  One note, though:  When checking on stock (and particularly if
ordering via expedited-shipping) it pays to ask what can be shipped within
one day rather than what is &quot;in stock.&quot;  The majority of the items that we
don't stock can be obtained within 24 hours, which is precisely the reason
that we don't stock them; if you order them one day, we can have them the
next. By ordering those sorts of items on a &quot;just-in-time&quot; basis, we can
direct our resources toward stocking in quantity those items that DO take
weeks or months to get.

&gt; Another list member addressed the fact that Bus Depot takes a
&gt; long time to ship, and made the comment that he'd pay the extra
&gt; couple of dollars for 2-day delivery.  With all due respect, I
&gt; don't think that list member ever tried that approach with the
&gt; Bus Depot.  I tried about 4 weeks ago, and there is a very
&gt; expensive charge to get things shipped in 2 days.

That depends on what you're ordering and where you live. If you're ordering
rather heavy items AND live on the west coast, the shipping difference can
be significant. However, if you are ordering lighter weight items, or if you
live on the east, the cost difference is often negligable.

&gt; paying this big charge only gets your order moved up in the queue.

Not only, but that is part of it.  All orders placed via next-day,
second-day, or three-day delivery get the &quot;V.I.P.&quot; treatment; they get
processed in front of every other order.  So even if you place your order
via the cheapest &quot;expedited&quot; option, it will put you &quot;in front of the line.&quot;

&gt; (If you order via 2-day shipping)
&gt; Instead of shipping out in a week's time, it will ship
&gt; out in about 2-3 days, then come to you via 2-day shipping.

That's not usually the case, although it does depend on what you order.
About 10% of the items we sell represent 80% of our sales. We try to keep
them on hand all the time. About 3/4 of what's left, we can typically get in
one day, so we generally don't stock it (as I alluded to above). Instead, if
you order it one day, we get it the next. Which means that your order will
not ship until the next business day even if you order via 2-day shipping.
The remaining 20% or so often takes a few weeks to get.  So it is actually
quite unusual for an order placed via 2-day shipping to ship in &quot;2-3 days.&quot;
Rather, those items that are not in stock tend to run to two extremes -
either we can get them in one day, or not for a week or more. In the former
case, the 2nd-day order would ship the day after it was placed; in the
latter case we would advise you that ordering 2nd-day was useless.  And of
course, in the case of the 10% of our stock that represents 80% of our
sales, we could ship out same-day if you ordered before deadline (about 3:30
pm if placed by phone or 2 pm if placed online).

Remember that we quote 7-10 working days on any order placed via standard
shipping. This does not neccessarily mean it will take that long.  Right now
we're ahead of schedule.  In August, our busiest month, we're sometimes
behind.  Use standard shipping for items that you're not in a hurry for.
Bump those items that you need pronto up to expedited. You'll find that
typically our prices are low enough that even after you pay expedited
shipping, you still save money.  And don't forget to request your listmember
discount.

 &gt; About a year ago , I ordered a sealed ball-bearing unit for
&gt; the sliding door track's vertical wheel from Bus Depot.  I tried
installing it
&gt; about 5-6 weeks ago, and it didn't fit.  I called Bus Depot to see if I
could
&gt; exchange this thing for store credit, and the customer service guy went
&gt; on the computer and saw all my other orders except this one.  Of course,
&gt; I didn't have the invoice for it, and maybe a year is too long to expect a
&gt; business to exchange a part,  but I've had other vendors do it.

We switched to new software about 6 months ago. I'm guessing that your
order, being a year old, may have been on the old software and therefore was
overlooked.  I'll check that and let you know if I find it.  Our official
return policy is 30 days, but we've been known to take back never-used
product for exchange way past that timeframe, so it shouldn't be a problem
as long as we can find proof of purchase.

&gt; Bottom line for me?  If you don't need it fast, call Bus Depot
&gt; directly, not their order hotline, and ask specifically if the
&gt; parts you want are in stock....  If
&gt; something went out of stock before your order shipped, cancel the
&gt; backordered item and find it elsewhere.

When you place an order, you have the option to request that any
out-of-stock items (which we define as anything we can't get within a day or
two, or one day max if you ordered via expedited shipping) be either
backordered, or deleted from your order.  If you choose the former, you will
not be charged for those items until they ship, so in the meantime if you
find the part elsewhere you can always call and cancel the backorder (as
long as the item hasn't already shipped).  If you choose the latter, we
simply remove any out-of-stock items from your invoice prior to shipping.
