&gt; &gt; If a defect case is returned to us, why in the world would we sell it to

&gt;I take it you've never shopped at Fry's Electronics...


Fry's &quot;corporate&quot; policy.
Take the return, broken or otherwise,
Shrink wrap it, drop the price a buck and hope the next sucker doesn't have 
the time to return it.
Eventually, they'll get rid of all their returns.

I will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER buy another shrink wrapped, repackaged product 
from Fry's.  Don't need a third strike.

Good thing they don't sell bus parts
