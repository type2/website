HI

I am trying to change a type 3 engine into an upright motor for my 61
bus.  It is a 1600 dp and had fuel injection and all the type 3 stuff.
(Which has been removed and is for sale, cheap!) I have noticed that the
distributor drive shaft is turned a little different than on a normal
type 1 or bus engine.  Do I need to try to remove it and turn it to the
normal position? Or do I just adjust the notch on the distributor body so
that the rotor points at it when #1 cylinder is at TDC?  If I leave it
like it is, do I set my timing differently? Or will it still be 7.5
degrees btdc? (I am using a 009 distributor.) Thank you for any help you
can provide.

Chris
1961 Bus
