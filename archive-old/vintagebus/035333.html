A friend of mine has a large cat, which is visible in the satellite image of 
his house in Oly.

 A couple of years ago I went to Terraserver_dot_com and located satellite and
 aerial photos of our neighborhood.  This site/service has images from US
 sources and from Soviet satellite imagery.
 
 As it happened, a Soviet image was the clearest, and I was able to identify
 our old '68 Westy and our H*nda parked at the curb in front of our house.
 It was quite a surprise to see how detailed the image really was, and also
 how many times we'd been overflown!
 
 Quality and resolution of these images varies widely, largely due to
 lighting conditions, but the &quot;good&quot; ones are very good indeed.  The problem
 is that by the time it's available on a website the data is at least a few
 years old.

 &gt;&gt;  I always thought it would be cool to get ahold of de-classified
 satellite imagery and scan it for buses in bfe.  I could write a crude image
 recognition program to isolate frame with potential buses, then search those
 frames by hand.  &lt;&lt;
