Subject: '59 Kombi...RPM's, brakes, &amp; wipers

Just wanted to thank for the feedback on the RPM's. I finally hooked 
up the wires to my tach and realized I was probably shifting TOO 
SOON!!! Thing is, I'm not used to the noise of a bus. I've driven a 
few bugs and could always hear the engine. My engine in my bus is 
pretty darn quiet and the trans/redux gears are what I seem to hear 
more of. So now I feel a little better 'cause instead of driving 50 
I'll easily be able to do more like 60 and still be around 3500 or so 
in 4th. Of course I havn't checked to see the accuracy of my speedo 
yet. I'll do that tommarrow.

I got my brakes adjusted a little and bled again. Used one of the 
cheapo one-man bleeder bottles. Worked nice. Brakes stop with one 
push now instead of having to &quot;pump them up&quot;. I started to adjust the 
emergency brake under the front of the bus. Didn't make much 
progress. I'll get back on it tommarrow.

Figured out that my wiper arms are probably from a bug. They still do 
the job. It doesn't rain here hardly ever and I probably won't be 
driving the bus on bad days. Just need to pass inspection.

So I'm shootin' to drive into work on Monday and get legal. Yeh!
