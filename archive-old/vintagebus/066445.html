Thanks for all who replied, I don't know why it didn't cross my mind that
would be where the speaker was. Now off to find an orginal speaker out of an
old bus in the junkyard. I bet that is gonna be impossible! I haven't went
out
and looked yet up under my dash, I wonder how it hooked up? And what size
the
speaker is. I will figure it out.
thanks again
john
