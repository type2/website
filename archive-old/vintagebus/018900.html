Said Wade:

&gt; If you've been lookin for a binz and 15k is a little too rich for your
&gt; blood, Scott from FL is also sellin his 57 Black binz #71 (the one with Binz
&gt; tag painted on the door) for $7800

I don't think that's painted on - I'm pretty sure it's one of those 
magnetic or static-cling signs.  Looks pretty cool, though.  You 
shoulda seen that Binz all decked out in lights in the Tallahassee 
Xmas parade, with my daughter sitting on the back.
