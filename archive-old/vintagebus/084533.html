Hi Rocky,
Definitely would help to have the whole distributor number.  The  
&quot;113-905-205 M&quot; we use is staticly set _at_ 7.5 BTC.  See about more  info on this 
distributor and many, many more on:
 _http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm_ 
(http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm)  
We found our distributor needed a disassembly (make sure to mark the  drive 
gear and distributor shaft so they go back together only one way),  cleaning, 
and lubricating to get it to work correctly.
