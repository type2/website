Subject: Tires in south Florida

Listees:

I bought my RD603V's at Fuzzy's Tire Center on State Route 7 in
Plantation/Ft Lauderdale Florida. They were really nice, and John, the
owner knew immediately what tire I'd need, without me having to discuss
all the requirements. His pick was a tire that listees have recommended
several times.

Also, I found a place to balance them on the bus, if you want to try that
technique. It was OK Tires in South Lauderdale, at 800 W. State Road 84.
THey also were very VW-friendly and knowledgeable.
