Volkswagen, but no bus content.

Last Friday, all hyped up for a bus meet. Spring Picnic in Corona Sunday, 
really looking forward to it. 
Friday night a friend calls me up, tells me of a small first annual VW show 
just north of Pasadena hes gonna go to.
I'm still thinking of making the long trek out to Corona for the bus meet.
Saturday morning, same friend calls me back all exited about a lead he had 
regarding an original owner 1960 beetle. Guess the original owner past away 
last week and the Son (hated his dad) was cleaning up his house and wanted to 
as he said &quot;unload&quot; the 60 beetle. He also mentioned his dad collected VW's 
for 30 years and had tons of &quot;crap&quot; stored in the garage.
I ask what the guy wants for the beetle and my friend says 300 bucks. I said 
alright, lets go take the truck and towbar and help this guy clean house.
Stop by the local VW meet and head out to this guys house at about lunchtime.
Walk int he backyard and see a really nice original paint light blue 60 
beetle.
Looked like the typical barn find, wrong taillights, 1600 engine.
Guy brings us behind the garage where I see some bullet fenders, some tube 
bumper fenders, and type three hood and fenders.
I casually ask the guy what he wants for all of the volkswagen stuff.
He says well the cars three and I'll take four for it all.
I play it cool and say, ok, sold.
We take a look inside the garage and I see a 65 bug hood, W decklid, few 
later decklids, about 5 36 horse long blocks, few bug trannys, STACKS of new 
VW crap, etc.
I kept unloading the shit out of the garage for what seemed like about TWO 
HOURS.
Truck was LOADED up with all th valuable stuff, decklids, hood, fenders, etc.
We realize we will need to make two or maybe three trips to carry away all 
the CRAP.
Seized motors, etc.
He said &quot;ALL OR NOTHING&quot; because he wanted to clean out the garage.
So time comes to leave for the first trip home and we hand the guy 300 bucks 
out of the 400$ total.
Now.....I cannot possibly describe the look on this guys face.......
Seems &quot;four&quot; was speaking in THOUSANDS, not HUNDREDS.
HAHHAHHAHAHHA
Feeling embarassed we tell him we'll start unloading the truck.
No harm done.....
Now my friend was playing good cop, I was playing bad cop.
I started to get a little bit upset because these people seemed like they 
were playing games with us.
In the end we drove away with a truck full of CRAP for 300 bucks.
Could have been worse, day wasn't a total loss.
Maybe once the guy puts down the crackpipe I can go pick myself up a new 
beetle?
