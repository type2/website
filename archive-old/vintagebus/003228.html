What a nightmare.....I bought a muffler from my local shop who told me &quot;good
luck finding a Lietspict&quot; (how ever you spell it) and basically convinced me
to buy the one they had.  Well I bought it, hook, line, and sinker and man
did I have to do some fabricating....I think I could have built a muffler
from cratch in the same amount of time.....WORST OF ALL I couldnt get 2
bolts to line up so I had to leave them off (for the time being).  You know
how there are the 2 nuts that hold it against the engine, those fit.....but
the 2 bolts that mount it to those pipes (the other part that is on top) I
could only get one on each side......anyways......4 hours later everything
was perfect except for those 2 bolts.....I think I will take it to a muffler
shop and see if they can get the other 2 bolts on.
