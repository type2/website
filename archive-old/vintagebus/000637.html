&lt;&lt; if i understand, i can change all my 62 brake for an earlier kit ??
 
 Like if all my rear brakes parts  need replacement, a cheaper way to rebuild

no, actually not.  the earelier type than yours is for barndoor, don't even 
go there

shoes should be circa $15 set, and rear cyliunders circa $15 brazilian.
