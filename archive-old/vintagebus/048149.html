&lt;&lt; Run the gears up higher, except on the highway of course.
 3rd gear will run 40-45 mph around town instead of shifting at 30-35 higher
 engine r's , am on the power band and faster fan speed, I remember in one of
 my Porsche books it talking about keeping the r's up in hotter weather to
 keep fan speed up to help cool the engine, I think it was the Maistro (the
 hoover of the Porsche world) who says this.

VW does say keep the rpms up.   They also don't quantify this, so I dunno 
what they mean by &quot;up&quot;   they did say don't drive below 20 in 4th gear, so is 
&quot;up&quot;  mean over 1K rpms, over 1500, over 2K,  2500?  3K?  3500?   It's 
unclear.  Vws are louder than some other cars, and the new VW driver may 
think that it is time to shift at pretty low rpms, I have seen this happen, 
really, why drive in 4th at 30mph?  (unless you have real low gearing)  That 
is time to shift down and pop the rpms up.  I do know that my bus runs cooler 
at 50 in 4th than 60 and cooler at 60 than 70.   I haven't checked 45 in 3rd 
vs. 45 in 4th,  or 40 in 4th vs 40 in 3rd.  Maybe I will do that.  This is 
why I like guages vs the berg blinky light concept, cause I can see these 
differnces before The warning goes off, but that is just my own PBO.  I can 
see that the blinky light can be a simply installed, inexpensive addition.   
I haven't really thought about heat/cooling at non freeway speeds as I have 
never had a problem running hot when not doing long freeway hauls.
