Subject: Re: Replacing fuel lines

Hi Adam
Ya gotta trust me with this one.  WHen you go to the FLAPS, buy about 6
feet of 1/4&quot; OD metal brake line, new clamps, and about a 1/4&quot; ID foot
of rubber line.  Use the rubber to make the connection to the tank, for
connections to fuel pump and filter if you have one installed.  I
realize the metal line can be a bear to work with (hint - cut the flared
ends off) but you end up with much less rubber ready to spring a leak.
Yes, you have more joints to tighten BUT the tradeoff is well worth it.
