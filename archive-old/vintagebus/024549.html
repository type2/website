Subject: Trans transplant, HELP!!!!!!

Dear vintage listies,
    Me and a very good person, old friend and former roomy of my
bro-in-law's spent most of the last two days attempting to put an early
'66 trans. into his  '67 westy.  Well, the patient has rejected the
transplant, it appears that the '66 came with it's drive shafts a total
of about an 1.5&quot; shorter that they need to be.

Friday we loaded the body and and former trans. onto a trailer with yet
another David, don't remember any problem putting it in?

QUESTION #1:  What is involved in replacing the drive shafts from the
'67 with the reduction boxes from the '66? That's assuming we'll be able
to get back in touch with the trans.

Question #2: Would anyone care to work out a swap?  I don't know the
actual functionality of the '66 trans. but we've been praying it will
work.

Question #3:  Does anyone have one they can sell me?  Delivery ASAP and
payment by end of Feb. (tax return time)

Question #4: Does anyone have leads to a trans. in any junkyards we
could possibly salvage?

David is a bit unavailable until the 2nd of Dec. and we were hoping we
could get his camper functional when he returns to us.  All participants
in this project are giving what they can and none of us have very much
more but blood, sweat, love and greasy fingers left to give.  James is
loaning an engine until my spare in resurrected (if possible).  So a
good lead on engines would be needed in the future.

This is an appeal for any and all for a good man with a good future in
tough struggle right now and who is meant for a good life.  If we can
square this for him he will have a real chance to find a good road to
follow in a true &quot;Busma&quot; blessed '67 Westy.  Please help, love and
greasy fingers perhaps.
This is the NE Ga. region, I live in Greer, SC please rally for the
cause.  We will pay or make whatever arrangements possible for getting
what is needed to make this happen.

Oh-Tay, I'm off to the labyrinth of the archives on that trans. swap
question
recommendations on particular posts or search words are always
appreciated.

May the &quot;Busma&quot; bless this endeavor. };&gt;)
