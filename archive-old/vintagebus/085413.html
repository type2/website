Subject: RE: [arizonabusclub] Prayers for Jerry Jess

Saturday, October 14th update.

Jerry was moved to a regular room this afternoon from ICU.

He has regained his speech, and movement in his arms and legs.  The right
side is still weaker than the left. 

Then he had a seizure when he tried to get up out of a chair.  Scared both
of us REALLY bad.  He seems to be OK now.  But they called in some
cardiologists because of a heart problem.  I'm not sure what it is, and
neither are the doctors.  There will be more tests. I don't know when he
will be getting out of the hospital.  Melissa
