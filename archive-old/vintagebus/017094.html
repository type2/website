I brought home the 2nd of 3 VWs from one place today. Last weekend I brought 
home a 1979 Westfalia Deluxe that had not been driven since 1989. VERY solid 
westy and is tan in color. It was kinda black and green when I got it home.  
Today I brought home a 1966 Bug that has set under a shed/polebarn since 
1983. Man was that thing covered in dust. Took three times at the power 
washer place to get all the crap off of it.

BUT, the third one is a VERY crusty 1964. Ive not taken that detail look at 
it, but there seems to be what looks like two bench/both type seats in the 
cargo area. I would assume they lay down to make a bed. THere looked to be 
some kind of outlet or plugin place on the end of one seat. I know it has 
one crank out windo on the drivers side...the middle of the three on the 
side. Its the full size window style.

As I was talking to the guy, he said that there was something else that goes 
with the 64 that he had forgot about. He said something about two things 
bolted on the edge of the roof, over the cargo doors. Some poles slip into 
this and extend out. There is a canvas that goes one these poles and makes a 
kind of dressing room area. I guess its been tucked away in the garage 
because he SAYS its in almost perfect condition. I dont know when the last 
time he looked at it, but it could be all eaten up by bugs now.

Im just wondering what kind of camper you would call this or might it be 
some kind of basterd thing that someone put together. Also does anyone have 
pics of this tent thing? The pole bag is in the van and in pretty good 
shape. I just hope its all there.

Thanks,
David
