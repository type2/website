&gt;It is inexcusable that Aircooled Junkyard was forced to shut down.
&gt;All we could do was save the online presence for posterity. Mr. &gt;Horning
&lt;says his ISP bill is paid through April. After that type2_dot_com will be
&lt;carrying the site _gratis_. It is not clear whether the site will continue
&gt;to be updated but at least it will live on as long as the list does.

 I really liked this site and the ethos that spawned it. Tragic loss to us
all.  A nice thing to keep the site alive.
