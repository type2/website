Subject: Looking for a 15 window delux...
Message-ID: &lt;19990314.110742.13790.0.greg_noll_at_juno_dot_com&gt;

	Well I am just about ready on my first and final project and I am
looking for a 15 window Delux to completely restore... Hopefully as close
to original as possible... So what I am looking for is one with a a
straight body and no PO modifications... or atleast ones that will take
major money to restore back... Any promising leads on a nice 15 would be
appreciated... I am in Northern Cali but would be willing to drive for a
nice one...

Thanks again...

Greg
