&gt; Ok, my transmission (for the '67) is at the rebuilder's shop right now, and

&gt; be able to cruise at about 75-80 mph on flat road.  What do y'all suggest?
&gt; Could anybody tell me an estimated cruising speed for the highway for each

&gt; boxes.  Thanks.

My experience is that 3.88 with .82 is a little bit too tall for stock
engines but I run 215/15 rear tires.  I think 14&quot; tires make it doable,
but not sure your going to get 75-80 out of it.  Maybe 70-75. My 67 runs 3800
rpm at 75mph using 215 15 tires. (3.88 with .82 4th)  Depends on what you
consider redline I guess.
Think about running some extra oil cooling
as it seemed to up the temps when I went to taller gearing.
