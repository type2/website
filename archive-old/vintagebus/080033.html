Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Listees ? Vintage and Type II

Bob Hoover commented once years ago, before the original bus list split 
up, that he thought that drivers of early buses were generally more 
mechanically competent than bay and vanagon owners.  He based this 
partly from pmail asking for help from bay and vanagon owners.  I don't 
think that this is true any more.  Keeping a now somewhat older vanagon 
running is quite a challenge for any owner who does their own mechanical 
work.  It is really a straight forward job to keep a split window bus 
running if you can find the parts!!!!   Gary Gibson
