Subject: Re: [VB] sundial vs westy

Chuck,
    I am already in for well over 9k in my '66 sundial custom resto.  I like 
Sundial's, American made, maybe not the same quality as an older westy but a 
darn good camper.  BTW, if your buying a 66 it will more likely be a Kombi 
rather than a panel conversion.

&gt;
&gt;I have a chance to pic up a 66 Sundial, and at risk of a flame war, can
&gt;anyone give me the pros &amp; cons of a Sundial vs a Westy. By that I mean is
&gt;the quality of the camp gear as good as a westy, do they hold their value,
&gt;that sort of thing. I know some of them were built on panel buses and this
&gt;one appears to be also, any pros or cons?
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Chuck
&gt;Van Is.
