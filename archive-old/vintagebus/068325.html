&gt; Hey everyone,
&gt; Has any body had experience with deluxe trim that's been rolled so it can 
&gt; be
&gt; shipped.
&gt; I found the last missing piece for my bus, but seems that people want to 
&gt; roll
&gt; the trim.
&gt; Doesn't sound like a good idea to me. I've talked to others that don't 
&gt; think
&gt; it's a good idea.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyways, hope  someone has had experience with installing it post-rolled.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Dave Barnes

Creative Engineering ship there trim flat. I agree it sounds much better to 
keep it flat in shipping. &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.creative-engineering_dot_com/cgi-bin/shop/web_store.cgi&quot;&gt;Click here: Welcome to Dave Palmers CREATIVE
