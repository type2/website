Hi all:
I've been working on installing new TMI seat covers on my truck's seats
today.  As I took off the old covers ( not original ) most of the sharp,
pointy spikes broke off.  A trial fit of the new covers show not much
extra material to work with and attach to the springs with hog rings.
Any suggestions on how to attach the covers?  BTW did I mess up by
buying 2&quot; thick foam instead of 1&quot;?    I hope not!  : )  
TIA
