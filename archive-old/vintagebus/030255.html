I'm going to want to get some
&gt;collision insurance on it.  That pretty much means getting an
&gt;appraisal.


Try American Collectors Insurance in New Jersey.  They did not require an 
appraisal with me, just a bill of sale and/or receipts for work (which can be 
made if you did the work).  You are allowed 2,500 miles a year (speedo cables 
easily disconnect on longer trips) and you have to garage it, but they are 
CHEAP.  I pay $300 per year for $48,000 of insurance.  That includes 
collision, liability, etc.
