I wouldn't get too excited over the use of aircraft aluminum for these.
It's one of the most easily available sources of suitable tubing.

The grade number doesn't mean much unless you know the temper as well.
6061-O has a yield strength of 8kpsi, while 6061-T6 has a yield strength
of 40kpsi, 5 times as much.  For an application such as a shift extension,
it would probably be better to use the -O stuff, since strength isn't as
important as formability.  If you wanted to get fancy you could temper it
to -T4 or -T6 after forming.
