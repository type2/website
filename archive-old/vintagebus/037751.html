i agree with robert, i did quite a bit of sandblasting on my 67, when i finished, i cleaned, and vacuumed, used the air hose i have taken everything apart several times and that stuff still shows up, not to mention how many days i was  picking that stuff outa my ears, the hood doesn't help that much.

the guys at the british car restoration place here in corvallis recommend soda blasting.  the soda dissolves with water, watched them do an austin martin, it took a little longer, and also the metal looked fresh and unpainted not sandblasted.

trying different things on the single cab

having the gates, doors, engine lid, and treasure chest doors dip and striped, the bed will be sandblasted. and i'm going to have the body soda blasted. also instead of replacing the rockers i'm going to experiment with wire spray welding.
