Joe and I took a look at this bus today and all I can say is damn. I have
seen some scary stuff, but this wins hands down. Only one spring in each
tube on the front end. Buncha broken screwdrivers and scrap metal holding
the spring under the grub screw. Suspension snubbers chopped off. Has
temporary use donut tires on it. Only thing that will fit. Right hand drive
and suicide door conversion engineered by Wile E. Coyote and executed by
Pee-Wee Herman. Left front door really was suicidal, already opened in
flight, would have caused serious damage if it had actually been mounted to
anything substantial. The tiny steering wheel actually appears to be
fiberglassed or epoxied to the hub! Fun!!! It has a couple of different VIN
numbers left so you can pick which year you like. 8^)

In the unlikely event that someone pays $3500 for this bus ($350 is a tad
steep for this one), and then manages to get it licensed and on the road, I
would be amazed. Between the front end falling apart and the front doors
popping open and launching passengers, it would be very exciting to drive
behind it, though. Actually looks like it was in fair shape before the
operation, too bad.
