 Hi All,
 I just spent the day preping the double cab for the paint booth next week...
 during which I removed the tag behind the seat and it hit me...  my tag
 looks like this:
 
 19 05 9
 361
 UP 265 BLUE 469869
 
 Now, Clara stated earlier that VW changed to the bastard 40 hp and the
 tunnel transmission on May 19 1959.... but mine definately has a split case
 trany (and the PO verified that it was the original transaxle).  So, all
 along, I thought the first line of the tag meant 1959 but NO, it means May
 19... (does the single '9' mean 1959???)
 
 So, could have this pickup rolled off the line the day of the switch???
 Could it have been possible that it got the split transaxel???
 Where double cabs diverted in the line a bit so it got an earlier chassis
 and a later engine?
 Would the engine have gone in near the end of the assembly line so it would
 have been the 40 hp???
 
 Wow, what fun!
 
 Cheers,
 
 Dave

yes- your bus rolled off the line the same day as the switch- may 19 1959
if it came with a split case tranny it would have come with a 36hp motor.

yes you bus is about 800 vins AFTER the change should have been, but 
evidently is not the tunnel case version,  thus my theory it fits in with the 
longer production model types, which may account for the inconsistancy.  like 
with my 61 which by vin should have a round dash speedo pod, but has the 
pointy cornered version, also is same day as change.

don't lose your tag!!!!

 &lt;&lt; OK, before I get too excited about a Okrasa 36 hp in my '59, I want to
  clarify what is the correct engine that should be in it in the first place.
  I know VW changed to the 40 hp late in 59 or in 60 but I can't remember.
 
  My chassis number is  469869.
 
  Also, how can I tell if I have the original engine?
   &gt;&gt;
 thanks for including you VIN, as it was a mid year change.   The &quot;modified
 36hp&quot; motor aka bastard 40hp was introduced at CH # 469 447 on May 19 1959.
 There also changed at this point to the tunnel case tranny from the split &gt;&gt;
