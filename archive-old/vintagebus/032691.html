Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch

you can also usually go to any vw repair place that has any kind of junk
trannies laying around/torn apart, or even a junkyard and usually get a
used input shaft for nothing. the only important part really is the splines
and they are the same size for all air cooled models. plastic ones are
available also for about $2.

&gt; &gt;  I know the problem::  the pilot alignement tool I have
&gt; &gt;  is too large for the VW clutch 
&gt; &gt;  MY CHEAP_ASS SOLUTION:  I figure that instead of
&gt; &gt;  trying to find a pilot tool for it I can tip the
&gt; &gt;  engine on its front on a block of wood and have a
&gt; &gt;  buddy hold the engine with the flywheel up in the air
&gt; &gt;  level.   I can eyeball it good enough and tighten the
&gt; &gt;  clutch pressure plate. 

&gt; yes, you can do this by eye.  or by feel.  Although clutch alignment
tools 
&gt; are available and cheap
