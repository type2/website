&gt;Hmmm, what if I tatooed my entire body like that, interesting...

Then you could auction yourself off as NOS!

I've been seeing the parts on the box for awhile now. They never say that
the parts come with or in the box, though...so that's a big sign. If I was
selling a part in an original box I'd plaster that all over the ad. The
other thing that bugs me is people selling t-shirts and other trinkets as
&quot;nos&quot;. Argh...I think most of these people don't know what it means, and
the rest are trying to scam people.
