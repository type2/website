Try this one, Doc.  http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/tech/hot/  (the Dakhlia link doesn't work here, either)

I briefly looked, and it seems like a lot of stuff you've/we've covered already... but good

&gt; At &quot;Busses by the River&quot; this weekend, we adjusted the carb and timing,
&gt; (thanks Mark!!) but still too hot on the way home, and very poor power.
&gt; -( I cannot enjoy the ride any longer, and that is very sad.
