&gt; Can I swap the nosecone from my current '61 tranny to this ?later? 
&gt; tranny? I'm think yes......but thought I'd check.

Hi Rex,
Only if both trannies are tunnel case type.  If you are this deep into there 
have both nose cones rebushed and replace the rear linkage bushings and rubber 
seals for better shifting.

&gt; Also, what about emergency brake cables? 

Use the 1964-67 cables in your 1961 DC.  For 1960 and earlier buses you have 
to have the 1961-67 cables shortened and new ends swedged onto them by any 
wire rope dealer or some motorcycle shops.
