&lt;&lt; Debate on the list says that it is 41mm or 42mm.  It's been stated that a

Hi George,
That debate was about the inner retaining nut on the lower 1964-67 reduction
axle.  Bob seems to be talking about the outer nut that holds the brake drum
onto the lower axle.  Which was 36mm for type I, and pre-1964 bus, and 46mm
for 1964-67 bus.
