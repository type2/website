 Personally I think 21 window and 23 window are about the same. I don't think
 it's so much about rarity of the bus but more like about the &quot;Ultimate&quot; bus.
 Most of the guys, gals have their ultimate bus in mind and I can bet
 anything you want that a 23 window sunroof DeLuxe would be at the top of
 that list.
 Me including.

 &gt; My experience has always been that the later model busses ('64-'67)
 &gt; are much more common than the earlier ones. It doesn't make sense,
 &gt; like you said, cause of all the years and restorations and such.
 
 
There's not that much difference between a 21 and a 23 window bus, just the 
two extra windows in a 23-window. By the way .. did you know that a 23-window 
bus actually has 25 windows? It's just a matter of how you count the windows. 
Does that mean that a 21 window actually has 23 windows?  They are both 
desirable buses.
