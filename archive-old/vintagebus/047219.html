&lt;&lt; How much play is aloud in the steeringbox splined shaft that connects to 
the 
 draglink.  I can tug and push it about half an inch.  Is this bad? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve &amp; Rachelle,
Hmm, depends.  Though it does not sound good.  This half inch play, is it by 
pulling on the arm in a left, right motion in relation to the bus or turning 
the pitman arm in it's arc?  Have you adjust the play in the steering box 
with the front wheels pointed straight?    Eric&amp;Barb
