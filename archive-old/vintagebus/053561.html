Subject: Re: [VB] Re: trailering a bus

Michael,
I've done it both ways, cheapest and easiest is the dolly. If your sure the
trans and rear wheels are fine its a good way to go. When we picked up the
77 in Oregon it was $55 one way to Victoria. On the down side it was $300
from Cal to Victoria for the '66. Lesson here is to check the states your
going through. According to all the Uhaul guys I talked too, anything one
way out of Cal is real expensive right now. Had I known that, coulda picked
up a dolly on the way down and paid $55 again. Did the truck and dual axle
trailer thing when we moved my dads '61 chev. Its definitely wider and
heavier than our buses. Pulled it with a Ryder 40' moving truck. Made for a
very long rig and for some real slow uphills thru Shasta and Oregon, plus
like others have mentioned pricey. Mind you we did this in the worst winter
on record in the PNW and it pulled fine thru sleet,snow,ice, rain and wind.

Thanks to the MANY encouraging responses and advice I have received from all
listees. The trailer that UHAUL rents and which I am planning on using
(their AT trailer) is 14' long dual axle which I hope is long enough- has
someone actually used a UHAUL AT (Auto Transport) trailer and can vouch that
the bus will actually fir on the trailer?

Thanks again everyone!!

Michael
