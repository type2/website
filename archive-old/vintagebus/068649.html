Subject: Re: [VB] Wiring Q's

That's funny, I just noticed recently that my 67 has started to do this
too! Havn't taken the time to diagnose, but it'll prolly be a corroded
wire or else, the only other thing will be corrosion on one of the relay
contacts inside the 9-prong sig-flasher box. My turn sigs work fine all
around, but on emergency mode, the left front doesn't flash.

Someday...

emergency light switch to on, all of my turn signal lights light up
(So far so good) but only the pass front signal flashes ?
