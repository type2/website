Subject: gas heater install plus...

Hi guys, 

Just a tale on my bus.

Due to the warm weather here, I am finally able to do some work I've wanted
to do for a while. I pulled the engine to determine the source of an odd
noise(see previous post). I am replacing the throw-out bearing. Which
hopefully is the source of the problem.  The noise could have been the
transmission-as I noticed the axle boots were torn and leaking-so I've got
those on order. Then I've got to top off/replace the tranny fluid.

I am also replacing the gas tank, and sending unit. Of course the foam donut
that the tank rests on-I accidentally purchased a couple years ago. I gave
the wrong part number or something like that. Anyway now that I go to
replace the tank, I can't find the part, so I need to order another one. I'm
sure I'll find it next week.

I am also installing a gas heater I purchased two years ago.I've been moving
pretty well through this. I got all the holes drilled. I got it all
installed today. Tomorrow, I'm going to take it out-and scour the engine
compartment, and try to paint up all the rust. I'll try to get two coats of
paint on tomorrow, then final coat Saturday. Then re-install everything on
Sunday.or later, depending on when my replacement parts show up.

The knob for the gas heater has a tiny set screw in it. I believe the
threads are stripped the know(not the screw). So I was planning on filling
the hole, then re-drilling and tapping. Any suggestions on what to fill it
with? JB Weld putty.?

Thanks.
