On a related note, at the Bug Out, does being a listmember get you into
the (and I quote from the brochure here) &quot;limited VW Club parking inside
the track ....on a first come first serve basis&quot;?

I think I'll be in the swap area anyway, but I may want to go for the
club option, if it's an option.  Also, is there going to be an organized
type2/vintagebus gathering of any sort?

Just wondering.
