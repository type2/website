was writ:  . . .Have someone actually see if an oil cooler and deep sump
really lowered cylinder head temp by very much . . .

It's my understanding that a deep sump is not designed to cool the oil. It
is primarily used for engines with quicker acceleration rates and/or hard
cornering to keep the oil pickup tube from sucking air into the bearings.
