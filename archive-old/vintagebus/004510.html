Thom,
  Yeah, the stereo is overkill, but the cigarette lighter works like
(snap) that, and the high beams will melt a Yugo in it's tracks.
Actually, a Single Cab is an excellent vehicle to convert. The weight is
between the wheels, slide out to the sides for filling the batteries,
tightening connections. No incursion in the passenger area. No power
steering or brakes to add conversion complexity, easy to remove the
combustion engine &amp; related components. Electric motor can be bolted
directly to the tranny with a one-fits-all-VW adapters. Body/chassis is
light weight, strong enough to carry the extra 500 - 660 lbs. Parts are
easy to get and easy to maintain. $16k? Not bad considering a solid SC
can go for 8K, EV conversion is 4-6K for parts without labor. A stereo
can be un-crammed.
I don't like the lowered look, but it might help with aerodynamics. This
SC will be running for a long time, so it has been preseved and
restored. It'll be an inspiration to vintage VW lovers AND EV lovers.
Fossil fuels are finite source, the sun, as it produces hydroelectric,
solar and wind energy, is closer to infinite.
Most vehicle trips are less than 5 miles. Interernal combustion engines
(ICEs) at best, convert 85% of the energy in gasoline into heat. 15%
goes to the wheels as power. Electric motors are 70-80% efficient. An
ICE has 4,000 or more moving parts. An EV has about 4 moving parts. Very
little heat is produced. Only thing emitted is hydrogen in small
amounts. High voltage? An ICE uses what, 5,000-20,000 volts out of the
coil? EV uses 120v at most. No waste oil, no pollution. It's easier to
control one smokestack at the generator (unless it's hydroelectric
power) than hundreds of thousands tail pipes.
The EV SC owner can drop a 25hp gas engine and generator on the bed if
they need more range.
Personally, I drive my EV Thing 3 miles each way to work and drive 2 -
15 miles during the day. I pay some road taxes to DMV at registration
time, but less than the gas taxes it would have used. Maintenance is
filling 10 batteries with water and cleaning splattered acid, and
plugging it in every night. I'll have to change brushes in 2 years,
bearings in 5 years. When my batteries die after 3 years, I have the
option to buy the latest technology to power it, fuel cell, lighter
weight batteries, flywheels, dilithium crystals, Pons &amp; Fleischman
Fusion unit, or simple Impulse power.

&gt; I have to question the wisdom of converting a truck to electric, then
&gt; immediately cramming a huge stereo in it...
&gt;
&gt; And a 40 mile range?  I guess it's a good thing it's a single cab; you
can
&gt; keep your bicycle in the back...
&gt;
&gt; And the thing doesn't even have bumpers?
&gt;
&gt; Who was the yahoo that appraised this thing at $16,287.75?
&gt;
&gt; I like the phrase &quot;The chassis is a rare and collectible VW classic,
which
&gt; has undergone improvements above and beyond full restoration, as well
as
&gt; conversion to electric power.&quot;  That's like saying &quot;I drove to work
this
&gt; morning, and then some!  I just drove south when I was supposed to be
&gt; driving north!&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Electric cars are fine, but they could have picked a crappy car to
start
&gt; with..

&gt; &gt;I don't have any other details except to say that EV's are great! My
&gt; &gt;electric Thing is saving me money while the price of gas goes up past
&gt; &gt;$1.70/gal. here in California. Fill the batteries every month with a
&gt; &gt;buck's worth of distilled water and $1.50 worth of Reddy Kilowatt and
&gt; &gt;I'm good for 30 miles a day.
