Hey All,

   Well I did a compression test today and things could be better. The
test reslts are as follows, Cylinders # 1,2 4 are fine all the same,
running about 120 each. But # 3 wants to be an individual, doesn't want
to be part of the team. That one is showing 30 lbs..So I know that ain't
a good thing.. So it looks like I must have a bad exhaust valve or it is
sitting funky.. Or I need to put in new rings all around.. Any other
suggestions?  This should be fun.. 
Thanks, Shawn
