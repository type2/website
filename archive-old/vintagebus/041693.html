&gt; Hi Volks, sorry to say I just received word from Tim Bernsau,
&gt;  Editor of VW Classics, that there will NOT be a second
&gt;  edition. So if you are a collector of VW &quot;stuff&quot; like me, find
&gt;  yourself a copy to save and put away.  Of course my 67 bug
&gt;  was to be in the second edition, I was that close! 
&gt; Bus content, it's 111* degrees out today so maybe I'll just
&gt; clean the garage up to be ready to assemble the motor when
&gt; I have all the parts.

That's a pity.  I found one at the local newstand and it seemed to be
pretty good.  The BBB4 coverage was great, and the articles were all
well written.  It was refreshing to see a mag aimed more at people who
actually drive their VWs, rather than running them around on trailers.

The only complaint that I had was that, by reading that issue, one could
get the impression that VW never manufactured baywindow buses.  If you're
going to produce a magazine for &quot;drivers&quot; it doesn't do to ignore most
of the &quot;drivers&quot; out there!

I'd have bought it again.  Hope someone fills the void.

It's not exactly cool here in Santa Clarita, either.  108 yesterday and
I'm afraid to look at the thermometer today!
