         Your Split Bus now has IRS and you're going back to Swingaxle?  Are
you going to sale the IRS Kit minus Tranny?

&gt;  I got in my '63 crewcab this afternoon, turned the
&gt;  key. After about 1 or 2 revolutions, while clutch was
&gt;  depressed, the truck just lurched forward all the
&gt;  sudden-like like the clutch was not depressed. I then,
&gt;  ever-so-gently limped it to a friend of mine's filling
&gt;  station and put it on the rack thinking it was
&gt;  probably a broken clutch cable. NOPE. Cable is fine.
&gt;  Lots of icky, greasy crap oozing from the nose cone. I
&gt;  suppose something internal has broken.
&gt; ...................
&gt; sounds like a sticky clutch to me actually.   If it was my truck I'd pull
the
&gt; motor, check the clutch (check pressure part of clutch too- place on
floor,
&gt; stand on it and bounce up and down to make sure it springs correctly), and
&gt; see if it is the main seal or tranny shaft seal that is leaking.
&gt; you can pull the tranny tooo and replae the nose cone seal, but the truth
is
&gt; that on at least 95% of the old VWs out there that seal leaks and there is
&gt; ooze and it keeps things from rusting.  You might top up the tranny oil.
&gt;
&gt; //////////////////////////
&gt;   Anywho, on to
&gt;  my question. It is an IRS tranny that I've been going
&gt;  to replace anyway because it leaks so much stuff in my
&gt;  garage, or anywhere it's parked for that matter. I
&gt;  would like to replace it with a freeway flyer or a
&gt;  Type 3 tranny. Are these the same thing or is one
&gt;  higher geared than the other. What kind of performace
&gt;  should I expect if I do put in a freeway flyer?
&gt; .................
&gt; freeway flyer you have a 3.88 r&amp;p and keep the RGBox (generally).  stock
R&amp;P
&gt; is 4.12 or 4.37.  lower r/p means higher gearing.
&gt; type3 tranny means no rgboxes with the swing axle center section.
gearing
&gt; may vary.  the idea is you get higher gearing over all as you don't reduce
it
&gt; by 1.39 (little nut) or 1.26 (big nut)
&gt; ///////////////////////////
&gt; I'm
&gt;  running a stock 1600 DP with single carb. Will this
&gt;  combo be OK in a crewcab with stock 1600 and all that?
&gt; ..................
&gt; My 65 westy has a 3.88 r/p with bus 4th  and 1.26 RGBoxes and 14&quot; rims.
With
&gt; a stock 1600sp it does not have enough get up and go.   Took the motor
from
&gt; the westy into the 61 (4.37 r/p 1.26 RG 205/75 15s- early 64 type gearing)
&gt; and plenty get up and go- comfortable cruising at 60mph.   SO geez this
has
&gt; been beat to death but I would not do the gearing in my 65 unless you will
&gt; build a bigger motor.
&gt;
&gt; guess you also need to know what gearing you have now if you want to know
&gt; what the changes will be, but I think you have a clutch problem.
&gt; //////////////////
&gt;  I'm assuming the broken tranny is a type 1 but not fo
&gt;  sho. Please respond if you can help answer my
&gt;  questions. I'll be checking in tomorrow for any
&gt;  answers that may fly my way. Thanks everybody!! Happy
&gt;  Holidays!!
&gt;

&gt;  '63 Crewcab - Buck
&gt;
&gt;  p.s. I'm having to drive my Type 3 while Buck is
&gt;  broken. YUK ! (But could be worse!)   ;o) &gt;&gt;
