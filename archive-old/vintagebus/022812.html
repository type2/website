&gt;can you let the rest of us know what was wrong with your switch, in case we
&gt;may run into a similar problem

Yeah, no problem...When we had the switch out and disconnected, I blew out
all the gunk and dirt and stuff that's gotten in there over the past 37
years, took the wire brush and cleaned the floor of the cab to ensure a
better contact when reattached, and sprayed a bunch of electrical contact
cleaner into whatever I could get the nozzle into.  Let dry a moment and
ran the voltmeter thru it (set it to 20 K Ohms, black to power-in) and
checked for current on either terminal while clicking the switch.  

The hi-beam side was (and always has been) fine, so that checked out.  The
Lo-beam terminal would give sporadic readings, so I touched it right to the
rivet and pressed down as much as I could with the probe.  Bingo!!  I had
current again.  Got out the trusty vise-grips and gave it a careful squeeze
(I know, kind of a temp fix, but it does work!).  Double checked everything
and I still had current going thru it.  Reinstalled it, hooked everything
back up...I've got hi-beams, but still no lo-beams at the blub.

Now there could be a number of reasons for this.  That's my project
today...check the rest of the wires...connections at the fusebox...maybe
just replace the headlights and see if that's all.  Then I get to check the
parking lights too...ahh, the joy of 6V.  ;)
