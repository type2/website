What a well written letter farewell letter Ken.  Not a day goes by but what
I think about the tremendous online resources we have and what kind of
volunteering effort it takes to maintain it all.  You guys that run the
servers, big websites, and put in long hours slaving over keyboards are our
food and water because without your online support, in a lot of cases we
simply wouldn't or couldn't be able to find out how to keep our dubs running
or keep in contact with our VW buddies which are so few and far between in
the real world but so numerous in the online world.  Prodecure and Lore -
man that's it - well said...
