Ok, you guys win.  You are 100% correct.  I was
completely wrong.  Pucks are absolutely unbiased worth
$8500. Ill spread the word. :(

&gt; Don't cha just love how its only the 'puck' owners
&gt; thatcome back defending the wonderf vw-ness and
&gt; tremendous 'value' of the pucks. :)I found dozens of
&gt; pucks in germany $300-$800
&gt; 
&gt; USD..tottaly mint units $1000 shipping is $500-$700
&gt; max...the internet is a far reaching tool...check
&gt; overseas if you wanna save some money.  Or pay the
&gt; it
&gt; was in Hot VWs, VW trends HYPE prices $3-6 grand! 6
&gt; months later you'll wish you hadn't.
&gt; -----------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Can you smell flame bait?
&gt; Smells like the same bitter root flak that I took
&gt; over
&gt; another vehicle in the past year. Have you ever
&gt; noticed that it's the folks who never contribute
&gt; constructive assistance to anyone and who hide
&gt; behind
&gt; free email accts who come up with the most bitter
&gt; attacks?
&gt; Whatever dude! You can attack &quot;Deluxe owners&quot; who
&gt; have
&gt; mondo over inflated price tags to defend, you can
&gt; attack people who happen to have a pile of once
&gt; unpopular double door panels to defend, Binzes,
&gt; Dblcabs, single cabs or what ever the flavor of the
&gt; day happens to be. But why?
&gt; Why not encourage the diversity of interests and/or
&gt; the perceived &quot;values&quot; which lay therein? If you
&gt; really ARE the sh*t and can locate qtys of these
&gt; &quot;dime
&gt; a dozen&quot; Pucks in &quot;mint&quot; condition then do it! If
&gt; you
&gt; know of an existing market for a product, know how
&gt; to
&gt; fill the need with an existing supply and you don't
&gt; step-up and fill that need (and make a deserving
&gt; dollar in doing so) then you are either full of
&gt; beans
&gt; or a fool. ~or a non-capitalist who prefers to sit
&gt; behind a keyboard and cap on other folks. While you
&gt; are at it Mr. Bigshot send me a source for a canvas
&gt; tent for my Puck. Share the sources. Attach your
&gt; real
&gt; name and reputation to the sources, information and
&gt; opinions instead of dwelling on backhanded passive
&gt; aggressive snide remarks. Don't be a dickhead.
&gt; 
&gt; Part of the reason that I am personally pretty
&gt; turned
&gt; off to the VW scene, at the moment, is because of
&gt; this
&gt; over commercialization of every nut and washer
&gt; coupled
&gt; with spiteful vindictive competitiveness.
&gt; This list used to be fun and funny with more
&gt; community
&gt; spirit. No one seemed to take anything very
&gt; seriously.
&gt; Lately it seems to be more of a shooting gallery.
&gt; 
&gt; Last week there was a big defense fostered and
&gt; supported that was based on letting the market place
&gt; determine the &quot;value&quot; of things. I concur. If
&gt; someone
&gt; wants to spend large bank for an incomplete custom
&gt; piece instead of paying the same amount for an
&gt; awesome
&gt; 37,000 original mile single cab then that's their
&gt; choice to do so. $54k for a barndoor deluxe, $45,000
&gt; for a camper, $25,000 for a first year Ghia 'vert,
&gt; $250,000-1.25M for a Mercedes Gullwing? or
&gt; $300-$4,500
&gt; for a Puck. Or is it all HYPE as my man, 'ff ff'
&gt; suggested? Hey, it's all up to the buyer to decide.
&gt; In the mean time 'ff ff' can perform a vacuum test
&gt; in
&gt; my direction.
