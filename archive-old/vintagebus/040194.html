For those in search of the Bentley Manual, 1963-67, I found a pretty good 
deal. While perusing an old Junk City (J.C.) Whitney catalog, I saw the 
manual for about $58.00! (quite a few &quot;bones&quot; less than I've seen anywhere 
else.._dot_usually up around $80-90+). I called the lady and placed an order. 
When I asked how much shipping was? She promptly told me something like 
$15.00! I asked her &quot;how she slept at night?&quot;.. she said &quot;what do you mean? 
Is the shipping too much?&quot; I told her &quot;It's a freak'n book. How can they 
charge $15.00 for shipping a skinny, little book to me?&quot; (I was not rude, 
just playing)... she took the shipping charges off, and I should have my 
$58.00 Bentley Manual any day now. Heck, even at less than $75.00, 
delivered, still the best price I've found, anywhere. Hope this helps. Jon
