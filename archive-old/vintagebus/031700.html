  Thanks to Everett (VW PLANET), there is a pic posted of the new EMPI BUS.
The one in the pic is a little different then the one that will be
available. The difference is in the wheels. The one pictured is a very
limited (2000)  the other variation there will be either 5000 or 7500, I
haven't got confirmation on this yet. I hopefully will be able to offer the
very limited one also, no word on how many of these I will get.
