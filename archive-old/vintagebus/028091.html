Subject: New (to me) carbs

Hello List,

I just bought a pair of 40-44 Solex carbs, used, for $80. Linkage and
all came with it. I thought it was a pretty good deal, compared to $400
for a new set of Kadrons...

The guy I bought them from said they worked just fine, but I plan to
rebuild them. They need some cleaning up, and I was wondering what is
the best way to go about it... Should I blast them with some sort of
media or scrub them with steel wool or tank them and paint them, or
what?

I also bought an Engle 110 cam, new cam gear, Empi lifters and heavy
duty springs. I'm a little worried about breaking a new cam in with
heavy duty springs, and thought about doing the break-in before
installing them, but my parts dude says it will be just fine. Second
opinions?

I'm reassembling my 1776 hopefully Monday or Tuesday, and will do the
break-in on an engine stand, then running the engine nekkid long enough
to check for oil leaks... I'll keep you posted. I'm pretty pumped about
it!

david
