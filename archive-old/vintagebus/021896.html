I just received one of the most random acts of kindness I have ever seen!!!

Driving over to Dave Easterwood's house on Saturday I lost a hubcap.  When I
got to Dave's I realized the hubcap was not on the bus anymore :(   Not such
a huge deal because it was a Taiwan POS repo chromie one.  After inspecting
the wheel I noticed that one clip was broken, one was bent in, and the other
loose...  No wonder it fell off.

Anyway, I went home for lunch today and when I went outside to get in the
bus to return to work...  WOW!  There is the lost hubcap with a note on it
from some random guy saying &quot;I saw your hubcap fly off and wanted to return
it&quot;.  I was floored.

I have no idea who you are but thank you!  I guess the bus karma works in
funny ways ;)

Now the really strange part is... How did he know where I live?  Kind of
creepy in another way, since I live deep in a neighborhood cul-de-sac where
no one would really know of.
