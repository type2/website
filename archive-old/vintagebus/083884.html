&gt; we were playing around with it yesterday but could not get it to line up ,
&gt; and the fan to fit,

You need the slightly dished 38A tin that bolts between the generator and
the shroud and the special 38A fan hub.  There should be very little
clearance between the fan and the tin.  Use shims to adjust.

Given those, the generator should fit with any width fan.
