they have suggested selling them, what betteer place to start than the 
web. . .and you! I also put together some technical bus info (colors, 
mcodes and chasis #'s) that took me forever to find when I first got my 
bus, and some pictures of my ride. let me know what you think. all info 
is true to the best of my knowledge!?!?
