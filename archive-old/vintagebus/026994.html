Subject: new bus

Apparently, volkswagen is having problems meeting the safety standard
with a retro design for the new bus. In the unlikely event that they
(VW) are reading the vintagebus list. . . I would like to say that I
know EXACTLY what they need to do to meet the standard.

I know a lot of you will think I am off my rocker, but I have been
working with some materials in some of my other projects, and the one
material is just what they need to achieve the flat front. And, I could
assist them with the design as well, though I am sure they have their
own group of punk faced kids fresh out of design school that think they
know all there is to know about design.

Anyways, there it is. The redesign is something I would love to do. If
Volkswagon is interested, they can contact me. But, I don't work cheap.

Les
