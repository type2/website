Subject: My wife's first ride in the bus

I talked my wife into taking a ride in my '59 Kombi. It's her first 
time to ride in a split window bus. Even though I had the safari's 
cracked and the cold wind froze our faces and ears, she still thought 
it was pretty darn cool.

got my registration. I still need to get the emergency brake working 
and get the other brakes working better to pass inspection. Then I 
can drive it legally.

Still need to install my bay window Z-bed in the back and do my 
home-made seat covers. Then...I think...it'll pretty much be done 
except for maintenance. Yee Haw!
