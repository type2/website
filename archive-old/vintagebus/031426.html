Subject: Suspected electrical problems ?!?!?!?!?!?!

&lt;&lt;It almost seems like someone was removing plug wires.   I would
let back off the accellerator and the engine would pick back up.&gt;&gt;

I suspect the coil. I have had one that the inslation became weak on.
This seems to happen especially if the engine has ever gotten too hot.
And it will act just like the way you described, especially if it is a
humid day or if it has rained. I remember one horrible night stuck in my
vw beetle with my sister, my brother in law and my first class bitch of
a first wife. Damned coil would not fire until daybreak. And she didnt
stop bitching and complaining all night long. He hehe. Dumping that
plate of cheesey potatoes on her head a few months later now seems like
poetic justice.

Swap that coil and see what happens.

Les
