Well, I started working on the '54 again, after getting my new garage set up
and car-friendly.

Every time I work on this beast, not only am I reminded how much work remains, but
also find little details that I missed before!

I welded in the passenger side rocker pieces this weekend, and have the doglegs
clamped in and one of them tacked.  I also took care of some alignment issues
on the driver's side &quot;Big Piece&quot;.  One of the trailing arm assemblies is
soaking in the parts washer right now.

I have the dogleg situation under control; still need corners, nose, floors, and misc
pieces here and there, like the wheel well clsoing panels, etc.  I fired off
a list to Alan Schofield, never heard back.  Time for a transatlantic phone
call I guess.

Thom
