[Mr. Kilbridge sent a message about his insurance problem to the webmaster
box. --KH]

Okay, this happens a lot and recourse is extensively documented (although
not well collated) so get yourself in a positive frame of mind because you
WILL prevail here if you merely have the tenacity to do so.

First, I'd go to the type2 search engine which lives here:

	http://vw.i405_dot_com/

and I would search for terms such as &quot;totalled&quot;, along with various likely
misspellings of that word. &quot;Insurance&quot; is probably too broad to do you any
good. I'm getting 118 hits with &quot;totalled&quot; and I see some threads I
recognize that address your problem.

If that doesn't work, post to the type2 list about it and people may send
you more information. In particular the $1475 figure for a 69 Westy in
decent shape in the Northeast is preposterous, I'm sure we can come up with
any number of people with credentials who will dispute it in writing.

Another thing you can do is cruise eBay and the type2_dot_com BuySell site and
see what people are asking for vans like yours in like condition.

The insurance company is counting on the prospect that you will become
disgusted and quit trying. Don't lose your temper but don't ever stop
trying. If you don't, they eventually will.

&gt;I don't know if you or someone you know might have some
&gt;advice on dealing with insurance companies that want to
&gt;stamp TOTALED on my type 2.
&gt;
&gt;My 69 camper was parked when a Boston city recycling truck
&gt;backed into it.
&gt;It still runs fine but it has a huge dimple in its right
&gt;cheek.
&gt;My insurance co. Met Auto, said the market value for a 69
&gt;VW camper was $1,475.00.
&gt;If I pursue this claim I could have them deduct the salvage
&gt;value and in turn, by it back for 50 bucks.
&gt;
&gt;Of course I would still have to get it repaired.
&gt;
&gt;The bummer is that I paid more than that for the vehicle
&gt;never mind the amount that I just put into it on little
&gt;things like new breaks, cv joints, muffler, push rods,
&gt;engine seals...etc.
&gt;
&gt;Any advice on the matter would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;I just love this VW and hate feeling like I'm getting the
&gt;short end of the stick out of a stupid accident like this.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for your time,
&gt;
&gt;Sean
