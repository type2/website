Subject: Brake problem ??

Being that I'm new to the vintage bus scene and that I have a lot of 
customers VWs to work on, meaning my VW's are at the back of the list (sound familiar 
Mark)?
Heres what I have going on ...My 67 westy daily driver brakes work 
intermediately 
when I run it to speed they work fine but if I run just from light to light 
in city traffic then the brakes have to be pumped up before it will stop. I 
have adjusted everything mechanically but starting to wonder if there's a vacuum 
assist like on later buses? 
Any help would be greatly appreciated
