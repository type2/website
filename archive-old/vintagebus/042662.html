hi all,

I have noticed a few things since i've been driving my 61, and with it
being friday and all i thought i'd share and see if you have had similar
experiences.

I keep my bus neater - i've always been a slob but my 61 i keep pretty
clean, i dont know why, but it works out that way.

i drive slower - my 71 i was always pushing the envelope in, 70 on the
highway.  But in my 61, i am happy to go whatever speed, it just feels
right no matter how fast or slow i go.

i do more maintenance - On my 71 i tended to defer stuff and im not sure
why, but the 61 is so much easier to work on that i find myself keeping
up.  This vehicle really does seem to be laid out for mechanicking.

eating lunch at work - for some reason since having purchased my split i
tend to take lunch in my van down by the river.  I make spaghetti-os or
something and enjoy the view.

needs reevaluation - this might be just me, but since getting this bus i
have seemed to be cutting back on purchases (at least non bus related)  I
dont know why, i just feel like simplifying things, maybe its because the
bus is such a simple beast.

So, i guess anyone that has any observations about ways that buying a
split changed you that you may not have expected is what i'd love to hear.

take care,

Steve

p.s. i didnt mention more attention from people because i dont like it all
that much, but if you do feel free to share :)
