Subject: RE: [VB] Another Engine Question


There is a service bulliton that states from VWoA to delete the paper
gaskets from under the cylinders. They say to use silicon VW part number
******** I will try to find it if I feel like going through all my books.

Gene Berg told me years ago (Gene did tell you!) that VW no longer used
the paper gaskets between the engine case and cylinders.  I don't use
them.  Gene is gone now but I am still afraid of going against his
&quot;suggestions&quot;.   Gary Gibson
