Subject: Compression Ratio...

I am curious to know what compression ratio I should use with a
particular engine. It is a 1776... but that may not matter... so much as
other things.
	I really don't know much about compression ratio, as far as choosing
the right one for me is concerned. I have built engines before, but they
were with new stock heads... i just made sure that the deck height was
at .060&quot; and balanced everything. I haven't gotten into compression very
much other than those related areas.
	I have tried to research, but 28-year-old reference materials I
doubt... The archives haven't been working for me either.
	It seems that compression ratios have declined since the early 70's...
I seem to hear 6.5:1 and 7.0:1 now instead of the 8s, 9s and 10s that I
have heard in the past. I assume it has to do with the quality of
gasoline, perhaps going from leaded to unleaded.
	I think that engines with higher compression make more power, but
perhaps make more heat and stress as well. This could be the reason for
hi-compression motors and their affiliation with racing, where longevity
isn't the greatest priority.
	It could be allegorical to tamping a charge of dynamite. No tamping:
explosion might as well not have happened. Tamped: effectiveness varies
on degree of tamping. Well, it's kinda close...
	So... the more a fuel/air mixture is compressed, the better the equal
distribution of fuel to air??? and the better it burns/makes power?
	I know that a lot of these things have to do with matching
components... cam, exhaust, intake, crank, pistons, and so on. It's
better to improve a little all the way through than just a lot on one
side of things.
	So I am curious...
What compression ratio would be optimum for longevity and mileage in a
1776 with 69mm-stroke crank and a stock camshaft, stock heads, to be for
a daily driver bus? 
I understand that people with higher CRs run premium gasoline. The
higher octane allows the use of a higher CR safely? How high but still
safe with premium unleaded pump gas?

I'm going to measure the combustion chamber volume here in a few days,
but it would be nice to have some solid information for my friend (whose
engine this is) as to what CR we'll go with. I want to build this engine
to last, but if I can get a few more miles per gallon (mainly) or hp
with zero ill effects, I think that would be a good idea. Buying premium
gas all the time won't be a problem.

Thanks!
