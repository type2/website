Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Selling your bus

Hey guys  I can relate  . I have 2 66 hardtop westys  made 15 days apart   
Now I have been driving the Ghoost since 1971  350K +    great running bus been 
everywhere in it 44 states, 6 canidian prov.  every  state on the east coast 3 
times at least  a little rough around the edges. ,    Now the other one  
&quot;Bubbles&quot;  is all OE  very rust free,  very very nice bus. 100K  , new motor .    
Now I need to pay some bills and Since we also have an 85 vanagon westy that 
is very nice and really travels better and also camps better .   So I think I 
need to sell one or both of the splitties ,   Kinda like selling your dog  or 
wife  LOL   Also have a 1967 panel bus to sell .  2K since restoring  very nice 
. It is posted on the samba.     Later Mark Dearing
