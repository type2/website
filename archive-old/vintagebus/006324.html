Subject: What Does a Woman look for in a bus?

I know the topic sounds funny but I knew it would get your attention.  The
week of the 10th, I'm going to go see yet another nice young blonde gal (old
workmate friend of mine) who lives an hour outside of KCMO.  She's never
ridden in a bus before but has ridden in Li'l Red my 74 Super Beetle.  I was
wondering if there is anything can do to make sure she enjoys the ride.  All
joking aside (I'm not looking for answers such as &quot;a mattress in the back
helps&quot; or &quot;make sure your underwear is clean&quot;), you girls on the list that
like buses - is there anything you like especially?  Currently the headliner
is grungy, seats aren't too bad, I don't have the front interior panels on,
etc.  Should I just clean up the bus really good and bring along some cold
drinks (it'll probably be hot that day.)  I just want to make sure she likes
the bus, enjoys the ride, and has a good time.  I don't want her to come
away hating it and disliking me for it.

This is gonna generate some traffic I know but I'm looking forward to the
replies...

:-)
