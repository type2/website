&gt; i am going to the SEMA show next week, SEMA is the largest
automotive parts convention in the world, last year they added the
tire retailers show to SEMA, almost every tire manufacturer in the
world will have a booth and a lot of the wholesalers will also have a
booth, last year i found 6.70X15  6 and 8 ply tires and a couple of
other sizes that were close,even found 10 ply tires, the funny part is
that most tires in these sizes are manufactured in the US of A for
export and don't have the federal DOT,&lt;

Is it possible that this is why some tires are listed as &quot;for trailer
use only&quot;?  If DOT certification isn't required for trailer tires
(since trailers don't carry passengers?) then one mystery might be
solved.

Unfortunately, I don't have any &quot;for trailer use only&quot; tires to check
for DOT numbers, so I'll throw the question open.

&gt;the distributors also told me most of these tires are tube type even
tho they are radials, they figure the roads in third world countries
must be harsh on tires so they figure the tubes must help, but they
also told me that i could run them tubeless with no problem,&lt;

Well, tubes are a lot easier to fix in the bush than tubeless, and
also seal well no matter how dirty or rusty the rim bead area might
be.  Also, cars sold outside the US might not be equipped with DOT
rims that have the tubeless bead retention groove.
