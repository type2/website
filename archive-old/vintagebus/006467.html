Hi
While tinkering around sifting through the junk in my shed i remembered
someone asking for sizes of flywheels..  sorry if the info is up already
so
12 volt =  176.5mm  with 130 teeth
6 volt   =   173.5mm with 109 teeth
not a great deal of difference in diameter - but from experience (for
someone else not personal) still a hell of a lot of early gearbox case to
get rid of to fit that 12 volt if thats whats being planned.

Glynn
