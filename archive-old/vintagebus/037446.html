It is kinda hard to tell from the pic, but I dont think the pic is of mesh 
platinum or any stock VW seat cover at all.   Mesh platinum would have the 
mesh part on the 'face' of the seats, and the 'platinum' part on the skirt 
around it.  UNfortunately, the mesh fabrics (both grey and plat) are somewhat 
fragile and rarely survive.  I think someone got the seat recovered 
previously, in colours similar to the mesh platinum.  It may be possible that 
they just replaced the ''mesh' part, and the 'plat' is original.

 &gt; David, this confuses me because the original color I

 &gt; tannish color of 
 &gt; platinum to the silvery color it is now.
 &gt; Also, I just got done stripping my front seats this
 &gt; afternoon.  Their 
 &gt; situation is the same as in the back, so I know the
 &gt; van came with this 
 &gt; color.  What's the deal?  Is platinum a silvery
 &gt; color?  And if so, is the 
 &gt; tannish color that WW is advertising incorrect?

 &gt; &gt;Looks like platinum to me.  A grey might get
 &gt; lighter, but it wont
 &gt; &gt;generally turn toward a beige tone. &gt;&gt;
