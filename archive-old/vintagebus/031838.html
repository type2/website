Doesn't anybody WORK for a living?. I have allready been overwhelmed (and I
posted 15 minutes ago) with request for this info and am working on getting

  I was on the phone today to a trademark attorney customer of mine and got
some interesting info on what VW does and doesn't have trademarks on, If
anybody is interested in seeing this p-mail me and I will forward the files
to you.
