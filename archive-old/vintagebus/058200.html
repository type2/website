 &gt;how do i wire my radio so that it turns off when i turn the key all
 &gt;he way off, but can be on when the key is in the first position, 
 &gt;before i turn the car on?is that possible?
 
 Not with the stock ignition switch in a VW.  The ignition switch only
 has three positions - off, run, start.  In &quot;run&quot; the ignition coil is
 powered.  Normally the engine is spinning, the points are opening and
 closing, and the coil doesn't have current flowing through it all the
 time.  If you're sitting there with the key on and the engine not
 turning, and the points happen to be open, everything is cool.  But
 if the points happen to be closed, there will be current flowing
 continuously through the coil and the points, which they weren't
 designed for.  If you sit there long enough, the coil can overheat
 and the points can weld themselves together.
 
 VW radios should normally be wired to the &quot;battery hot&quot; wire, so that
 you can run the radio anytime, even without the key.  Yes, this means
 it's possible to run your battery down with the radio, so you have to
 get in the habit of checking the radio before you leave the car.  My
 Dad was concerned about this, so I put a lighted switch in the radio
 power wire in his Bug - it lights up when the switch is on as a visual
 reminder for him to turn it off when he leaves the car.

Maybe all my VW switches are non-standard. But the radios all turn off by 
turning off the key. And I own 13 VW's. What I do is instruct my hand to make 
it so that the radio turns off with the key, and then I forget about it. I'll 
find out what he does and let you know.
