Subject: RE: [VB] Do brosol fuel pumps equire packing w/grease?

  Over 2 years ago. I got lucky when all my suppliers ran out and they
weren't available any more I found out that EMPI had bought up the last of
what was built. Of course I bought a couple of cases of them, which are long
gone, except for the ones I have in personally use stash. But did you know
that it is either Autozone or Checker that still sells a rebuildable pump,
country of origin unknown.

When did the Brosol pumps stop being re-buildable (removable tops)?  I
found a new unused one at a garage sale cheep.  Nothing better than
finding VW stuff at a garage sale that no one wants :-)
