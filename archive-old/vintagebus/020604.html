From the comments I've received from the list thus far, since I wasn't
leaking until I pulled off the drum, the leakage is normal.  Your
situation is similar to my original problem, which simply was an old seal
that finally gave way.  My current confusion was that I just replaced the
seal a little while ago, and there was absolutely no leaking at all until
the day after I took the drum off and left the bus on a jackstand. 
Again, THAT is apparently normal.  If you recently replaced your seal, it
could be that you didn't push it all the way until it set against the
outside edge of the bearing cover.  You could have the wrong weight gear
oil in your boxes, or something is causing some extreme heat in there. 
Or... it could be a bad seal.  :)  I do think it's something you'd want
to figure out.

When my drum was loose, it's because the cotter pin broke and the nut
wound out about a 1/4 turn.  I would now recognize the sound, but I
couldn't figure out what it was, and for several weeks drove around
thinking I just needed to replace a shock.  The repeated movement of the
loose drum bore the spline valleys wider and indented the face of the
drum with the corners of the nut, which made torquing it impossible.  

Oh well.  Live and learn.  &quot;You must torque the rear axle nuts properly.&quot;
 &lt;--- My words of wisdom.  

That's one area that  &quot;To ignore is to part quickly with one's money.&quot;

Don't mind me - I'm weary of work and giddy to work this weekend on
Gretchen.

&lt;&lt;Very strange!

I took my '67 Westy on about a 1,000 mile trip a couple weeks ago all
over
Washington, and I have this exact same problem. (My rear driver's side
drum
got loose somewhere near Forks, glad I had brought that pounding tool
with
me, since I obviously couldn't bring my impact wrench. :)

Now she's been sitting forlornly in my garage, bleeding gear oil until I
fix
this problem this weekend. Anyways, what brand of seal did you use? Maybe
there's something wrong with a batch of seals that are out there.&gt;&gt;
