      I don't see why people don't just buy a bus and do all there swapping 
at OCTO. Don't swap at the classic, if it wasn't for the OCTO meet, I 
wouldn't go down there.  I didn't live here at the time, but from what I have 
heard, the reason there is no bus get-together before Bugorama was that BH 
was upset that there was money being spent under the freeway, and thought 
that he was gonna loose mula the next day. Now that I think about it, now 
that he is the new partner for the classic, I wonder how he feels that OCTO 
gets the big swap the day before the classic??

&lt;&lt;Anyway it looks like the cool swap place
will be the OCTO show with their $10.00 fee for everything. Get to OCTO
early as I'm sure most of the selling will be there!! I'm off the band wagon
now. The list has been to quiet. Can you tell I agree with Thom. Hope to see
most of you at christmas tree island friday before OCTO for tacos and
dinner.&gt;&gt;
