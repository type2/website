Subject: Westy part needed
Message-ID: &lt;36E2AFB3.5382D7A7_at_best_dot_com&gt;

Hey all you westy owners,

I am looking for the piece that mounts on the floor in the rear that the
leg of the dining table
screws in to keep it locked to the floor.  Mine
somehow has been lost.  So if anyone is parting out a westy, early or
late, I am in need of it.  Thanks .
