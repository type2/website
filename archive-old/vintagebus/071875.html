&gt; Anyone know where to get these?

Hi Tom,
We are still looking for those.  Found electrical grommets at Lowes a couple 
years ago.  Turned out they were so soft that two weeks later you could wiggle 
the metal fuel line up and down and hear it tapping on sheet metal again!!!
  Thanks Everett for the Ace hardware store advice we will give those a try.
