I really coulda used it.._dot_caught that too late.  My '67 Deluxe had 
rear-ended someone pretty bad before I got it.  The crunch reaches from door 
to door.  I had been searching for a way to fix it ever since.  Still 
keeping my eyes open.  Happy driving--Chet

&gt;man, someone got it for 15 bucks...guess their arent as many crunched nose
&gt;buses as i thought.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;who was looking for nose metal?
&gt;it closes in about and hour and a half
