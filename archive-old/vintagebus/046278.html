&lt;&lt; I guess I can figure its nothing VW put on there but, Under the bus mounted
 on the transaxel is a switch, A pushbutton type switch, it dosent lock on or
off, I tested it on a volt meter, When its pushed it makes a connection and
when released it breaks the switch (on/off) Its pointing towards the front of
the bus On the linkage is a screw (right befor it enters the transaxel) it
almost looks like the switch was activated by that screw pushing onto it when
you shift in  to reverse except, It dosent quite hit the switch. Anybody heard
of such a thing befor? I was thinking it may have
 been a dealer option reverse light or mabey a Sundial thing.

Hi Chris,
That sounds like the back up switches that started being produced somewhere in
the late 1940s or early 1950s and continued thru the early 1960s.  We bought
one years ago NOS in a back up light kit made for and sold by VW and it is
still working today in our 1963 K. Ghia.  Eric &amp; Barb
