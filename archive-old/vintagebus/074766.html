Subject: For all those DIYer's

I love to design new projects and this one hit me tonight when I was trying
to straighten up the shop.

When overhauling an engine, the biggest problem is all the extra pieces,
what do you do with them?  Most people just scatter those pieces of tin,
intake runners, exhaust parts and everything else all over the shop, or if
they are somewhat organized, put them in boxes.

Well I've got a solution that combines storage, bench space and engine stand
all together.  Picture this, a welded 2 inch square tubing wood top work
bench on wheels with wooden shelves inside, open on one side and at the end
is a bolt on engine bracket like Ronnie sells at OldVolks_dot_com.  The bottom
frame can extend out a couple of feet under the engine bracket and a metal
pan can be fabbed to catch the oil.  The back can have a few pegs in it for
hanging some parts like cables, flywheel, clutch, belt and other flat
pieces.

The entire bench and engine stand wouldn't need to be more than 6 feet long,
4 feet for the cabinet and 2 feet for the engine.  24 inches wide should do
for width.  The lower shelf can be taller than the upper and to make things
more organized, a couple plastic containers can be put on the upper shelf
for small parts.

Just picture it, taking the engine apart, draining the oil into the lower
pan, then storing all the engine parts within easy reach and not loosing
anything when you're ready to put it back together.  Not to mention, work
bench space in easy reach for tools and sub assembly work.

I think I've talked myself into another project .............. but hey, the
shop will be more organized!!!!!  I may need to build more than one :)
