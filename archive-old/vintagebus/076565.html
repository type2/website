Subject: Re: [VB] front seat area? 

From: Claralw_at_aol_dot_com

&gt; I don't understand how you are getting the M codes from the overhead airbox,
&gt; though.  Normally the M code tag  is behind the passnger seat.  At least in
&gt; RHD it's behind the pass seat.   Are those *all* the M codes on your tag?

In late RHD buses the M code plate is behind the driver seat along with the
colour sticker.

On the airbox on the left hand side is the chassis plate

In the engine bay on the right side engine surround is the chassis no stamp
