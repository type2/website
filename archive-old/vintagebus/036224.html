Hi Michael,
If your VW was made at least a couple of thousand or more numbers away then 
you have a pretty good chance that it is going to be the correct part number. 
 Any closer and if it has any any wierd or extensive M-codes the bus might 
have been sidelined to install factory accessories before the part change and 
then finished after the changeover!  Clara has one of these buses.  Chassi 
number too late for the pointy top corners speedo pod, but probably due to 
factory installed safaris the chassi number is later than the official speedo 
pod change over.    Eric&amp;Barb
