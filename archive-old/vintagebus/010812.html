&lt;&lt; Tonight I spent a little time getting the bus prepped for the trip to the
 OVWC campout and show this weekend.  I needed to change the oil so some
 20w-50 was added now that we are in the hot summer months here in Nebraska
 and I'm anticipating a trip to Colorado.  Pulling mountains with hot temps
 will surely drive my 1776 bonkers so I figure some 20w-50 will do a good job
 protecting it.

 I didn't think of 20/50 oil prior to my trip to central ore, I'm sure it 
would have helped a great deal with those triple digit temps &amp; canyon climbs.

With the help of Chuck Johnson of Too Quick's German Auto, Tacoma, WA.
I found the reason of my over heating problems from that trip a week ago.

It turned out to be the dizzy clamp had failed, setting the timing &amp; points 
was only
good for a short time, within a few miles? The dizzy would retard &amp; things 
began to sizzle. So, one more thing to add to the....What if column.

Will you need to bring extra carb jets with you for the altitude change?
