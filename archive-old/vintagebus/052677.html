Subject: RE: [VB] Harber Freight Sandblaster

&gt;I have a HBF 80 sandblaster. Hates play sand, clogs it. Like black
&gt;beauty, big tip, full sand flow at tip valve, lots of air.
&gt;Al


bingo. black beauty is all i can use, too. DRY black beauty... and forget
about reusing it: it'll just clog.

if i HAD 250, i woulda bought a tips or sumpin. if you have 80, and need
some small jobs done, the hf is ok.
ps - if you have a crappy air compressor, it won't like ANY sandblaster. i
wait a lot for the thing to catch up.
