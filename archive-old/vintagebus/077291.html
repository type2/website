I have lived in Oxnard since '65 and made that trip to
SF up Hwy 1-101 many times in my 64 bus.  In those
days camping was much easier. My girlfriend and I
lived in the bus for a couple years traveling the
Northwest and ending up in Colorado where the heads
fell off (no inserts).  Yes, that trip is quite an
experience.  It's fun to hear others share the same
enthusiasm.
