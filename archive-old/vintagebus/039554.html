I'm putting my cargo door latch assemblies back together tonight, and I have 
a question about the washers that go in between the latch and the long 
pins(?).  It looks like these have a bend in them so they will cause tension 
between the bolt and the pin/latch.  What is the purpose of this?  The 
reason I ask is because I lost two of the washers, and I am curious what I 
should replace them with.

Thanks for all your help,
