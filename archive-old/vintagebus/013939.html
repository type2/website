If anyone has problems while down around Gainesville, give me a call. 
352-371-6101.  I wont be leaving for Tampa until Sat morning when another 
caravan from south GA stops in G'ville for breakfast.

See ya there !

They have a web site at:

Peach State Transporters will be leaving the Atlanta area headed for the
show on Friday morning.  We will be cruising slowly down I-75 South if
anyone wants to hook up along the way.  I think we will meeting David
Raistrick &amp; Charlie Ford at the GA/FL state line &amp; we will probably hook
up with a couple of people in Gainesville, FL as well.

If anyone else is planning to travel down I-75 and wants to hook up and
caravan, get in touch with me so we can set up a meeting place.

Dave
