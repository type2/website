&lt;&lt; makes me wonder if you are using the heavy duty oil pressure relief 
springs, 
 and what weight oil you are using. &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
Definitely check your relief spring/s length against the info in a Bentley VW 
Official Service Manual for your year/type of engine case!  If still in doubt 
replace the spring/s with new stock one/s.
 
&lt;&lt;even with 30 wt oil here, my oil pressure in my 65 goes up to about 50 or 
60 
 at lidle when I start it up in the morning.&gt;&gt;
We tried 20/50 Wt in our 1641SP DR case with vintage oil filter pump.  Below 
50 F the oil pressure at start up would easily go over 80 Lbs. if revved at 
all.  Interestingly in our big bore 40 HPSP SR engine with same oil 
filter/pump, same 20/50 WT oil seems to just run about 60 Lbs. at start up 
during higher revs and 40 Lbs when warm.   Eric&amp;Barb
