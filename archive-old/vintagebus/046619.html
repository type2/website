&gt; If anyone has one that will fit a bus, I need one for the '66 hippy van

&gt; so I can play my 8 tracks that I have kept all these years.

8-tracks deteriorate with age much more severely than cassettes do. Unlike

cassettes, they used a lubricant on the reel within the tape cartridge

itself, which has likely dried up after all these years.  Meaning that once

you find a way to play your old 8-tracks, you may be very disappointed with

how they sound.  Then again, I suppose that considering that they're

8-tracks, you weren't exactly expecting CD quality anyway. :-)
