Subject: new things in rmmw's catalog

Finally got around to looking through RMMW's latest catalog.  They
have a couple of interesting things:

- white wall tires, ``5.60 x 15, 2.25&quot;''
- a clutch adjustment wrench
- out-of-vehicle starter kit

Although I'm not particularly concerned about white wall or not, if
these really are the correct tires, I have to admit to an interest in
getting a set.  Then again, $140 each is a bit much for a sight-
unseen experiment.

The wrench is for wing-nut adjusters.  It's not really what I'd call a
wrench, but it fits over the wing-nut, and gives you something big
enough to get a grip on with your whole hand.  Kind of a
Maltese-cross- looking thing, but with rounded corners.  If I still
had such an adjuster, I'd definitely get one ($9.95 seems reasonable
to me, considering how painful doing it by hand's been in the past).

The starter kit is a bracket to hold the starter (much smaller than
the half-a-bell-housing people typically recommend), and a trigger-
style clip-on starter switch for $74.95.  The hole for the starter
shaft looks kinda small in the picture, but probably is fine.

I find it amusing that they tout the ability to order on their web
site now, but I couldn't find any of the above items on it (at least
not by description, didn't try part number).
