Subject: more front beam questions

Hi List,
I think I understand most of what yall are tryin to
tell me about changin out my front beam except for the
inquiries about the tranny. I have no idea 'bout this
big nut/small nut thing. My truck has an IRS rear end
from either a bug or a type 3. How does this fit into
the equation of the brakes when I change the front
beam??

Thanks again,

Pete
