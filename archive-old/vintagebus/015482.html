Subject: RE: Hole above the engine bay
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have a hole above my engine bay that is about the
size of a softball. I cut it there so I could change
out my bad sending unit.  I have been told that that
is what the factory service people did when necessary.
 Don't know about that, but it worked great for me.

Enjoy your day!
