hello all,

The next installment in my continuing saga...

As i said last time, the engine was done except for a couple of wiring
issues.. i had to wire up the regulator and the choke and extend the oil
sender wire to reach the type3 oil sendor on the cooler.  I did all that
and got the engine in the bus last night. (putting it in the bus was the
easiest part so far. heh)

Put the valve covers on, filled it with fresh oil... and went to crank the
key until the oil light went off.  Then the battery conked out :(  Too
much &quot;testing&quot; of the headlights and cool turn signals i guess;) So i
cleaned up the terminals and hooked up my 71 to it with jumper cables.

Put some gas in the tank and cranked the key, and cranked the key.
Nothing happened.  Squirted in some starting fluid, still no go.  Turning
over but not a single indication of it wanting to start...

Even had my girlfriend crank it while i checked the timing. Set it dead
on. Still no go.

Then i had a funny idea, what if the t3 is 180 out on the dizzy gear from
a t1, or at least this one is... turned the dizzy 180, asked my girlfriend
to crank it, then it started right up :)  Since i have that stupid
aftermarket exhaust, it was loud as hell... Much jubilation at this point.

time it again (but in the right place)

After running it a while, every now and again there was a big CLANK  like
someone dropped a rock in the cooling fan, so i stopped running it to
figure that one out.  I'm figuring its not inside the engine due to the
volume of the sound, and where it sounded like it was coming from, but i
am unsure.  One guess is that i forgot to torque the pressure plate bolts
and one of those fell out and is hitting the flywheel, so the engine comes
back out tonight to check the torque on those.

Anyway, since i did the valves withthe dizzy being 180 out, they are a bit
off and clattery, i have to recheck them.  I drained the oil after about
10-15 minutes of running, just to flush the engine.  It was clean looking,
no metal chunks. (i might use the t3 dizzy after all, its one of those
with the FI points on it, but it might line up better with the engine...)

Since the distributor has an oil hole that needs to line up with the case,
at the very least i'll turn it back to where it should be and move the
wires on the cap. Having the oil hole not line up is a sure way to kill
your dist. quickly (and this one is a german 009, so worth saving.  its
tight and slop free too, yaay.)

So tonight i check and clean the strainer, torque the pressure plate, and
other minor engine stuff... then i have to fix a leaky axle seal on the
drivers side rear... and it _might_ be time to take it for a spin. (oh and
my throttle return spring is inadequate, what a shock, so i need to get
another one of those...)

I dont want the first drive to end in disaster so im being pretty careful,
but there isnt much left to do...

_hopefully_ more progress tomorrow to report (and not that i found a chunk
of the rod in the bottom of the case, heheh)  I really do hope i can
figure that clank sound out... i dont think its a rod or a crank bearing
as its too occasional.  Couldnt be a dropped valve either, as that wouldnt
be an occasional clank either (that would be one hell of a short lived
racket followed by a disintergrated piston and the sound of a rod loose in
the case) Hmmmm.  My bets on a flywheel bolt thing... or something to do
with the fan/generator. (or maybe itll just go away, leaving me to wonder
for all my days...)

take care,

Steve
