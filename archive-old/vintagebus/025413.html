Hey folks,

I want to make sure you all get there, so just a few 
corrections to Harry's directions.

&gt;From the 5 fwy, take the 91 East (not the 95) to the 57 
South.  Exit at Katella and turn LEFT under the fwy.  The 
Pond is on the left, you can't miss it.  See you there!

Steve

The San Joaquin Valley caravan is a bit smaller. I didn't 
get the '63
doublecab finished, but have the sore muscles, torn hands 
and burnt out
brain to prove the effort. Unsurprisingly, the major 
problems were with
the non-stock stuff, CV joints, dual carbs, etc.
We'll ride with Karl and C.R. to be at the OCTO Saturday 
morning.
Travelodge on Katella is pretty close to the Pond, parking 
is near the
rooms and reasonable.

Travel alert, the Katella offramp from 5 is under major 
construction. I
only have the directons from Southbound 5 to the Pond. Take 
95 east,
then 57 south. Take the Katella offramp, turn right.

I'm still going to buy a pint for the listee group at the JT 
Schmid
brewpub, close to the Pond. Come over about 1-2 p.m., we'll 
have our own
area. I'm planning on 20-30 listees, but the more the 
merrier. At the
meet I'll be at Craig's red/white doublecab, the guy with 
the name tags.
