BTW thanks for all the condescending mail re: my post.  Its good
to see the M-code Nazis are not asleep at their posts :-}

You are very welcome. If the undesireable discussion of a topic that
you did not intend to start commences from a part of your post, and
this causes you discomfort, the best way to avoid it is to include no
words in your posts. IMHO. I didn't read anything that was
condescending, maybe that was a reference to p-mail? It was just, as
you say, a discussion of minutae. You don't have to get pissed off...

My 2 cents (or NON-sense) :-) :
Boy, if I didn't learn that the hard way! You've gotta know that
putting your opinion out there is grounds for any and all forms of
response, not always the response you want or expect.  MY experience
taught me not to say anything at all unless I think long and hard
about the potential outcome on the list.  I don't even reply with a
response unless I KNOW it's correct to avoid undesirable
&quot;corrections&quot;, unless I do it via p-mail. In other words, if you post
to the list, be prepared for ANYTHING from the listees. Just a lesson
learned from a once-newbie! (I'm hoping my hard lesson in humility
brought me out of newbie status!)     :-)
