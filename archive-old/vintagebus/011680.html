Mike Gensler asked:

&gt;&gt;Anyway, my question is... I've had my case tapped for full flow. But
&gt;&gt;what kind of fitting do I need to screw into the case that will clear
&gt;&gt;the behind-the-pulley sheetmetal? Gotta be some kind of 90 degree
&gt;&gt;thingy.

Brass pipe fittings, which are available from most (many?) auto parts stores,
work well.  You can _carefully_ radius the corner of a 90 degree fitting for 
clearance using a bench grinder.  Just don't take too much off! -;)
                                      
&gt;&gt;Also, I was thinking about hanging the filter mount from the support
&gt;&gt;beam on the underside of the bed (roof of engine compartment), but on

I've run this setup for years, and have had no problems.  I use an oil pump and 
oil pump cover that I bought a long time ago from Gene Berg, and run Fram PH8A
filters, which are commonly available.

Rather than use the support beam, I bolted the filter mount directly to the
roof, after first removing the upholstery panel above the roof.

&gt;&gt;further thinking, this sounds like a horrible idea. If the hoses run UP
&gt;&gt;to the filter, wouldn't all the oil run out of the lines everytime you
&gt;&gt;turn off your engine?

This has never been a problem for me.  I also ran an oil pressure gauge along 
with the full filter, and did not see any drop in pressure, which one might 
expect if there were air pockets in the system.

&gt;&gt;If so, obviously I need to hang the filter from
&gt;&gt;under the bus somewhere so the filter mount is no higher than the oil
&gt;&gt;pump. Does this sound right?

Nooooooooo!!!!!

The first golf ball sized rock that gets kicked up under your engine 
compartment will likely puncture the filter, and bye-bye motor oil!!
And what about hoses getting caught by a fallen tree branch or something?

Even if you fabricated a &quot;bullet proof&quot; cage for the filter setup, I still
wouldn't recommend putting the filter underneath the car.  Just mount it from
the top of the engine compartment, as you originally planned.
