Zac,

Check the fuel cutoff switch on the side of the carb. Sometimes they
vibrate loose or the electrical connection isn't as good as it should
be. Either condition will cause the switch to not work properly and
make it so your engine won't idle. To test the switch, make sure its
snug in the carb body, turn on the ignition and unplug it. You should
hear a click when you unplug it as the switch closes the valve in the
carb. This valve shuts off the fuel flow through the idle circuit in
the carb. Power=open. No power=closed. If you have a bad electrical
connection either from a bad wire or bad ground (loose switch), then
you won't have any fuel for idling. The loose switch will also let air
leak in and lean out your idle mixture even if it still works
electrically
