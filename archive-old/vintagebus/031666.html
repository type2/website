  This is to claify (nothing to do with Clara) on this.

FRIDAY night at the Red Barn the London Bridge Bullis (BBB IV) guys, mainly
me and VW Howard will be putting on our FAMOUS Taco fry. This is something
that we do at all Friday night pre event camp-out's.
This year we expect a lot more people then last year so a RSVP to
vwhoward_at_ctaz will help us fiqure out how much food to bring.

Also being this is a user friendly camp-out and a great social event, we are
trying to make this more of a pot luck dinner, so bring a side dish, exmp,
beans, chips and salsa, dessert cake or cookies, Tequilla, Cerveza Sol , you
know what I mean. 

hope to see whoever there   ronnie   LBB
