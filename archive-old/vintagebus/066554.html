Subject: rattle ?

well i got it started, changed wiring as per
www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/hardstart.pdf, i think.

anyway, i took it for a uick spin-to go get more fuses for the relay, and
one for my neighbor-whom i borrowed one from. on the way to the store i
noticed this really scratchy kind of rattling noise-perhaps like engine tin
rattling, but rather loud.

so i pulled over to check it out, and instinctively shut the engine off.
went back there-then thought-geez i should have left the engine running to
try to track the noise. i go back in to the engine compartment, and try to
start the engine, but pop goes the fuse again. so i run down(literally as it
closes at 9) to the FLAPS

En route i stop at a gas station, and ask if they have any fuses, the guy
looks as me at asks me what fuses are, so back out on the road and continue
to the FLAPS.

I pick up some 15 amp fuses at the store, run back to the van, where my
neighbor is watching it for me. pop the new fuse in, blow through two of
them. so we decide to try and pusch start it. push start works, i drive a
block, and then pull over to try to determine the sound origin-no luck. i
drive home, back into the driveway-in case i have to push start again.

again we check for the origin of the noise. no luck. it kind of sounds like
a rattling. when i rev the motor-it does not get louder, actually the sound
of the motor drowns it out. i am imagining i accidentally dropped a nut or
washer inside something or other, and it is getting rattled around-but it
sounds too loud for that.

a low down on what i have done to the bus during this shakedown in case this
may lead to an answer:

accelerator pedal linkage replaced, i also bent the tab on the frame back so
that it is straight. install synflex over accelerator cable where it hit the
tranny case.

replace broken brake return spring.

replace broken clutch return spring.

replace front shift rod bushing, and brackets on either side of front
compartment that hold shiter/shift rod assembly together.

made hoover bit out of aluminum can. install.

tighten heads(as new engine has about 7000 miles i think)-which involved
taking rocker arm out, pulling engine etc.

install cb performance oil pump/filter setup.

replace generator pulley(which was 12v) with 6v pulley ronnie _at_ oldvolks_dot_com
scavenged for me. now pulleys are aligned much better.

after writing this i am wondering if perhaps the rattling is due to the
shift rod not being adjusted correctly? although shifting seemed to work
fine. it felt tighter due to the new bushing. but i didn't drive enough to
know. if the noise is coming from the tranny-wouldn't the noise dissappear
in neutral??

thanks, sorry for the long messages, i am just trying to be thorough.
