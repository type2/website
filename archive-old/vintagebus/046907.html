Gotta question...I just bought some brake drums and backing plates from
somone and he didn't want to take them apart so he also gave me axle tubes
and the split case transmission...along with the two reduction boxes....My
question...How do I get the reduction boxes of of the axle tube of the early
split case models?
 Something else I am glad to announce,  I have the only splittie VW
bus in Texarkana! Kinda neat there....Anything anyone can tell me about the
r.b. will be helpful thanks

why do you want to get the reduction boxes off the axle tubes?    Basically
you don't.   The tubes and inner half of the box is press fit togeher and
should just be left that way unless there is a good reason.    Get a copy of
the Bently reprint for investigating into removing rear axles/tubes/RGBoxes-
they should be the same as the 63 version.
