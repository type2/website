No offense Eric...
I've used a brake cylinder hone for both t-i and t-ii king/link pin assy's
and recently on a swing lever rebuild for a good friend.  
What's a reamer go for these days?   And a different one is needed for
each application too right?  Well, I was able to use the same hone for all
three applications.  Myabe just luck????  I don't think so, but the reamer
is the tool of choice I will admit...i'm a cheap bastard!

&gt; &lt;&lt; The reamer that a person uses when you installing the swing level pin and 
&gt;  bushings, how does this work? do you use hand power or a drill?&gt;&gt;
&gt; Hand power just like the one shown in the bus shop manual for doing the king 
&gt; pins.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&lt;Could you use a wheel cylinder honer instead? &gt;&gt;
&gt; Not really a good idea.  Brass, and bronze tend to clog up the honing stones 
&gt; taking far longer to do the work than steel or iron that they were designed 
&gt; for.  Even more importantly the proper reamer is supposed to have a centering 
&gt; end device to align both bushings to each other when you ream them!
