Subject: Re: [VB] re wont cold idle

You definitely need to fix the choke *first*. When the engine is cold, it requires a richer mixture
to keep it running. Since your choke is wide open when it is cold, the engine is getting a mixture
that is too lean to keep it running.

When you manually set the choke, you are probably setting it in a position that leans out the
mixture too much and eventually stalls the engine. The electric choke is designed to gradually open
the choke as the engine heats-up.

Fix the choke, set your idle at the correct speed and let us know what happens.

bit fast, maybe 1000 rpm) So it is occillating idle. My electric choke is non
&gt; functional, but if I run back and manually adjust the stair step choke

bingo. fix the choke first.
could also be icing, i dont know how the weather is where you are.
if its icing unblocking the risers and hooking up preheat hose is a
solution.

Don't think it's the choke, cuz if I manually goose it, the problem still
persists.

Icing hmmmm?  I have the crappy paper air filter.  What is involved with
&quot;pre-heating&quot; set-up.

Weathers cold.  Colorado winter.  have had this problem anytime under 60
degrees though.  Warmer the weather, the quicker the warm up happens.  Once
warm, idles fine...
