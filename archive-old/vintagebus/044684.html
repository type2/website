Hi all-

I have some questions regarding my wifes 66 westy if you all have the time.  I
took her, &quot;Rosie&quot; as the wife calls it, on its first trip in a year.   About 3
hours each way.  Later this week my plans call for driving it from Northern
Cal to Arizona to the gathering there over the fourth.  About 1500 miles each
way by the route I am taking.  This trip showed a hot engine that I must solve
before taking it beyond reach of home and through the deserts.......

 Its been sitting engineless for about half a year.  I put a dual port 1600 in
it that has about 5 k miles since a total rebuild.  It has a doghouse type oil
cooler.  The PO of the engine took out the fan vanes out of it.  I put on a 6
pass external oil cooler on the side of the bus above the air intakes that BTW
have air ducts mounted to push air into the engine compartment.  My intent is
to make this thing run as cold as possible. I also put a VDO oil temp unit in
that uses a stick that goes where the oil dipstick goes.  Also- it has a 30
pic carb on it.  This is unusual by me as the dual ports usually have a larger
carb mount that fits the larger single carbs (34 pic?).  

Heres the problem.  My buddy has this setup and he says his engine stays
around 180 degrees no problem.  My problem is the temps on the highway in this
weekends trip the oil temps were around 230 degrees when I cruised at 55 mph.
When I tried to go 65-70 mph, the oil temp went up to 250 degrees.  The day
was moderate with air temps around 80 degrees.  These temps are hot from what
I know..  Also-  my gas mileage what only about 15 gal. per mile.  It does
seem to be running rich that I have yet to solve.  

Heres my questions:

1.  What &quot;should&quot; the engine oil temps be for a VW engine?

2.  Does the absence of the directional vanes in the engine fan make a good or
bad differance?

3.  Does the smaller carb make a differance?  Is the engine somehow &quot;leaning&quot;
out making it run hotter?  My plans are to put a larger manifold and carb on
it.

4.  How accurate are those oil dipstick temp. gauges?

5.  Any other comments for me on making this thing run cooler and making my
vacation pleasurable???

Thanks for any help.  Help me and I promise to rescue at least 4-5 more busses
for you guys and gals   :)
