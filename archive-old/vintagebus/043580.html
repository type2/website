&gt;The PO mounted a switch in the dash for the wipers. Flip the switch one
&gt;way and I get 7V and the other way I get 12V. The switch says 10A 250V; 20A
&gt;125V. So I have high and low wipers.
&gt;  I pulled the switch out and there are two wires from it to the wipers. The
&gt;wipers have 4 wires. 2 of them are not hooked up, one of which is brown so
&gt;that would be a ground wire. I don't know what the other one is, but the
&gt;wipers do work.

As others have posted, this is not the original motor for your '63.
On the later Buses, the other two wires have to do with the self-parking
circuit.  I haven't been able to figure it out exactly yet, but grounding
that brown wire probably won't do what you expect.  Ignoring the park
function, the two wires that are hooked up are the &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot;
speed wires, and the motor is grounded through its mounting or via
a short ground wire from the motor to one of the mounting screws.

The markings on the switch you have just indicate its rating.  If it
has no further numbers, it is really rated for AC only and will
sooner or later have problems from running on DC - mostly burned/
pitted contacts.  If you plan on keeping this set-up, get a 12V DC
rated switch and it should last longer.

If you get a '67 wiper switch and hook it up as shown in the '67
diagram, you will most likely get two speed wipers with park.  Right
now your wipers probably shut off wherever they are as soon as you
turn off the switch.

I hope this helps!
