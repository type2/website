Subject: EMPI superdeluxe hubcaps

I don't know if anyone saw the pic on theSamba of the rare EMPI Super
Deluxe
hub caps.  I was wondering if it was supposed to be a joke (since there is
a reflection of a BRM in the nipple of the cap), or if they really are
what the caption says.  The reason I'm wondering is that about a year ago
I picked up a set of caps identical to these from an old stash.  They were
wrapped in yellowed tissue paper, they are really good quality and have
&quot;Made in W. Germany&quot; stamped on the backs.  I just figured they were old
Porsche caps with no logos or something to that effect.  They definately
don't have any VW logos on them (or any logos for that matter).  If anyone
has any info on these caps, please let me know.

Adam &quot;Beefcake&quot; Bruno
