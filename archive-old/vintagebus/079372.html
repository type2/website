Subject: Re: [VB] Start Button in Engine Compartment

crawl under bus, attach wire to push on connector on start next to the one 
that the wire to the key is connected to.   
run the other end of it into engine compartment.  use a thick wire, long 
enough to reach the + of battery.   .  make sure bus is out of gear, ebrake on, 
touch wire to +, starter should activate.    you can use as is, or mount a push 
button in engine compartment, or even elsewhere so you don't have to get out 
in the rain to start the bus.

I used this in my 65 westy, which over a few years developed a hard start 
probelm which became progressively worse and eventually untenable.   since I 
installed a new starter it has always started with key.  why didn't I do that ages 
ago?   dunno.  not hard to swap starters

The recent conversation on hard starting when busses are warm has had me
thinking about installing a start button in the engine compartment. My '66
beetle has a button installed under the rear seat that will frequently start
the engine when the ignition switch will not.

Has anyone had experience with such a button and what is the best way to go
about installing one?
