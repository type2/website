&gt; But how can you have your bus up for auction on two websites? What if
there
&gt; are two different highbidders?

Easy. I had the reserve set at $5000 on the vintage bus auction. I had a few
local folks interested, but I didn't want to waste any time getting it up
either. I knew it would never get that high, so I wasn't committed to
selling it if it sold through other channels. After the locals fell through,
I decided to throw it on ebay as well. Besides, with all the deadbeat
bidders out there, I'd be lucky if either one of the high bidders came
through. And I'm half right already  :-)
