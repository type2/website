There are cases where I'm a vintage nazi, and others where I'm more
relaxed.  Some buses are destined to be driven, others to be held 
close and cherished.

I have a bunch of non-OG stuff and &quot;incorrect&quot; parts on my '60, but
my '54 is going to be as OG as I can muster.  I can drive the '60
every day; it's great for home depot runs.  The '54 will never see a
parking lot, except an occasional trip to work.

It's one thing when someone has a frankenstein bus, and claims they
can't drive it because they don't have the correct-logo'd windows.
Quite another when someone else has spent (guessing here) 5 figures
on body and paint for a 90+ point resto.

Setting up a car to drive and setting up a car to show are different
things entirely.  In some cases they can be parallel, in some cases
mutually exclusive.
