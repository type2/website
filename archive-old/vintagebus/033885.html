&lt;&lt; I feel like if a bus needs paint, paint it whatever color you fancy. Same
 with interior. If your bus interior is trashed and you want to make it
 nice, do whatever you want...within reason. (Within reason means no extra
 cutting or irreversable damage to the bus that wasn't already there when
 you got it). Finding a nice stock original bus would be something you'd
 probably want to keep that way. But if the damage has already been done, no
 reason you HAVE to fix it back to stock, unless your plan is to sell it.
 Then, as we all know, it's worth more in stock original style condition.

I second that, My 59' will never again be red and white, I'm going for 
seafoam green and off white or something close to that. Probably just plain 
gray vinyl inside as its cheaper and easier. Indoor/outdoor carpet from the 
local home improvement store and I'l be done. I prefer to save cash for the 
running gear. Better than the two tone rustolem flaking off and guted insides.
