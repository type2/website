&gt; Subject: [VB] that speedo scan
&gt; 
&gt; some folks reported trouble downloading that scan... anyone want to host it
&gt; as an ftp or sumpin? gettin' outta my league here...

I just (in Netscape/Windows) right-clicked and saved the link, adding a 
.psd extension to it and Photoshop pulled it right up.

I agree jpeg is NOT what you want for a &quot;print&quot; product like this.

&gt; as far as cleaning it up, i was trying to delete the yellowed film
&gt; background, but wasn't getting very far.

I'm no PS guru but it seems like one ought to be able to filter out that 
color somehow, at least get most of it, with some kinda adjustment layer.
