&lt;&lt; OK,  A guy wants to trade my b*g for his '65 double door panel. I wanted 
to 
 know if the '65 panle had the big window in back. I know that any other '65 
 would, but I have never noticed any panels having the big window in back. 
The 
 only thing that the list would probably not approve of is that the bus has a 
 1776 with dual 40mm webers, and dropped spindles. But to me it is still a 
 bus. I can fix it when I want to.
  &gt;&gt;
yes, it would have a regular back door with the big window.

you probably haven't seen that because not many commercial VW were sent to 
the US after 63 because of the raised tariff that made them very pricey., so 
there aren't many 64-67 panels around here.
