Subject: Re: [VB] Check your Keys!

this is actually something that can work in YOUR favor!  I have a box of
old keys; new car (to me) w/ no keys.... try alla the ones in the box :)

Once amazed an old-time scrapper; he had a 72 KGhia he wanted to strip, but
the doors were locked, and he didn't want A) to bust the winders or B) pay
a locksmith. I whipped out my 70 BUS key, and not only did it open the
doors, it started the motor!
