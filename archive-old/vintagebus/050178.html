Subject: Need Server--PLEASE READ!


Our gracious host ISP, Arizona Access, sent round mail last night
indicating that it will cease operations as of December 31st. The lists
have to find a new home and we have ten days to do it.

If you can host us as a virtual domain or a co-located box please let me
know ASAP. We're pretty demanding, would require at least 100 megs of space
and we chew up a lot of bandwidth. If we could just get a feed we would be
happy to provide our own hardware. If virtual domain, please no Microsoft
operating systems.

If we're not able to find another situation with donated bandwidth, we're
going to have to do some FUNDRAISING around here, people, so get ready for
a pledge drive. Unless we're able to nail down a feed by mid-week, we'll be
having a bus-a-thon until we get a years' worth of bandwidth in the bank.

THANK YOU to Marc Edwards and Arizona Access, who put up with a lot from us
and got nothing in return.

If Arizona Access were to go down early and leave us stranded, you can
always check Stephen Gutknecht's site for status information (bookmark it!):

And the admins will still be able to post announcements to the web
reflectors at egroups (bookmark these too):
