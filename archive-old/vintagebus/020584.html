Thanks to whoever suggested Tom Connor, and then whoever forwarded my
email to him.  I called him yesterday to get one ordered, and he emailed
me this morning saying someone recommended me to him.

As I wrote Tom this morning, there's a lot of matchmaking going on in the
ACVW industry.  It's great!

Thanks to all.

Adam
