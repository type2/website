Hi list,

Getting ready to check out the possible barndoor find this afternoon. Have
questions:

Do barndoors have VINs like later buses that tell when they were
manufactured? If so are they in the engine bay like later buses? If not
where are they? The bus in question is apparently way in the back of a shed
and is filled/surrounded with junk and I will have less than an hour to
check it out.

If they don't, are there any tell tale signs of the model year like turn
signals and front door handles in later splits?

TIA for any pointers.

Later
