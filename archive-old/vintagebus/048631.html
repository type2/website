Subject: Change the stats! 23-window is mine!
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, I'm now the official owner of a '62 23-window walk-thru deluxe. I
still have to go retrieve it. But it's paid for. 

I gave the guy an extra $100 &amp; he threw in a parts bus! It's a '66 standard
&amp; is actually pretty complete.  It has a lot of the little stuff that I
need for the 23-window. (glass, tail lights, ect.)

No engine in either bus.

I also got him to throw in a contraption that bolts in the rear-end when
the tranny is pulled. Makes it so you can roll it around &amp; such.

Got it all for $1100. Now I just have to go get it all!!!!
