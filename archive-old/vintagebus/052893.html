&gt; Frankly I can't see why I

&gt; yourself if you think you can
&gt; increase the size of the fed govt w/o them raising
&gt; your taxes ) to destroy
&gt; the objects of my hobby, and much less the

&gt; &gt;I just did a quick read of this bill  # S.1766, and
&gt; it seems that it only
&gt; &gt;applys to turning in vehicles that are registered
&gt; and operational, not
&gt; &gt;salvage yard units.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; &gt;Any comments?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; 
&gt; yuh - folks with a running, RESTORABLE junky bus are
&gt; gonna say &quot;$400
&gt; (typical payout in these bills) towards a camry?
&gt; SWEET!&quot;
&gt; how those (assumed poor) folks intend to come up
&gt; with the rest of the cash
&gt; is never addressed.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; it does mean that some clunkers sitting 'out back'
&gt; will be spiffed up and
&gt; tagged just long enough to get the dosh, and
&gt; scrapped.
&gt; not too many.  a far more serious threat are bills -
&gt; usually local - that
&gt; make it a crime to even HAVE a non-tagged,
&gt; nonoperational vehicle on
&gt; property, even out of sight. some communities in
&gt; texass even have
&gt; provisions allowing removal by sheriff w/ little
&gt; warning to owner.
&gt; 
&gt; believe me, if TEXAS passes sh*t like this (where a
&gt; man can be legally shot
&gt; dead for stealing HUBCAPS on yer proppity), y'all
&gt; likely have similar laws
&gt; a brewin.
