Subject: AIRS Report

Howdy busfolk,

Well I get a call last night from some dude broke down in San Diego who got my name from the AIRS list.

He gets here this morning, and his 68 fatty literally has a 1/2&quot; steady trail of oil following his bus.  He says he had to put 2-3 quarts in every 40 minutes.  So we drop the motor and begin the greasy work.  Ended up that the case was cracked behind #3 and the cam plug was non existant.

I've had an unknown motor sitting in my garage for several months now, came from a bus that was sold a few weeks ago.

Switched tin and whatnot, slapped the unknown motor in then fired her up at 4pm, and he drove off into the sunset at 5pm.  Man that motor souded sweet, I regret putting it into his bus now, but oh well...maybe that put a few gallons in the karma tank.

So if you see a red/white fat chick bus truckin' up I-5 wave and say hi, his name is Allan and is from New York.

First time dropping a fat chick motor, so I learned a few things today.

One other thing, Allan told me he called at least 7 people on the AIRS list, and all were disconnected numbers or the persons did not live there anymore.  If your on the AIRS list then update your info!  The list does no good if people can't be reached.  I know several of my friends have gotten stragglers back on the road due to the AIRS list.  My time has not come, and I hope it never does when I have to use it for a breakdown.

No maybe one of these days I can finish the brake job on my 60 Std, been sitting on jackstands for a week now.

Later,
Beto
