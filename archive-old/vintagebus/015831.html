Subject: Problems bleeding brakes

I've got an intermittent problem with my brakes. Have just rebuilt all 
cylinders and put on new shoes all the way around. Also put new line in from 
MC to back &quot;T&quot;. I had trouble bleeding the rear once so I also took out the 
MC, Disassembled it and cleaned it up. Honed the inside and put on a new 
rubber washer on the piston. Tried to bleed them again and fronts bled fine 
but then the rear still wouldn't. Then I realized that fluid must be getting 
cought back there because if you push and hold the pedal for a time the back 
brakes start to stick and hold even when there is no pressure on the pedal. 
So now I bled the back at the T and then at the rear wheels and it seems to 
be working now. What is up with my bus? i'm confused. Is this some single 
circuit secret that I don't get?

Scott
