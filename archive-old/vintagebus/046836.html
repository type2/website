&lt;&lt; Scuse my ignorance. Is the shift rod bushing in that little tang that 
hangs down under the cab area and surrounds the shift rod? I know that I have 
this little tang thing hanging down but there is no plastic or otherwise 
bushing thingy in it. &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
Depends what year bus you have!  Pre-1960 buses have a all metal guide with a 
banding strap like spring under the rod to push it up.  
1960 thru 1966 chassi # 216 028 111 uses a plastic forward shift rod bushing 
in that little tang as you describe it.
Then for later 1966 thru 1967 the forward shift rod bushing went forward of 
the shift rod socket, supporting the rod by the rod on the front of it.

&lt;&lt;Looks like it could use a bushing thingy however. A good piece back I 
suddenly found that my gear shift stick could slide out toward the passenger 
side and make shifting a little difficult. Is that a symptom of no bushing?&gt;&gt;
Definitely if it had one for your year or else the guide area is way too worn 
out.
