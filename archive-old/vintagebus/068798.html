It is but Once you been to the Classic you been there.  Now have you been to
Nebraska?  It is the home of the good life.  At least that what the state
motto says.  No Classic for me this year.  Heading to Glacier and maybe
Banff the last week of July and the first week of August and than dropping
down for the RMMW show and Bandimere drags than a mad dash home for work on
Monday.  My birthday is 8/10 so come celebrate it with me.  If anybody wants
to hook up with Terry Wolfe and my son Justin and I let me know
Rob

&gt; Heh Rob,
&gt;
&gt; Isn't that the same weekend as OCTO/Classic- I know Nebraska is tempting
&gt; that time of year, but it will be hard to be in both places at once????
