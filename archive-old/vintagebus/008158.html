funny you you ask about that, my friend just took apart my speedo last nite
and replaced the little colored bits , he used the tape they sell at
autoparts stores for like a busted turn signal or tail light , he didnt have
green and no need to replace the high beam blue so im not sure if they have
those colors

Subject: [VB] Speedometer repair


&gt; Yesterday I discovered the Westy's speedometer was pretty beat up.  All
the
&gt; colored stuff (turn signal, gen &amp; oil) is either missing, falling out, or
&gt; badly discolored, and the plastic socket for the gen light is broken.  I'm
&gt; going to try replacing the socket since it looks like it's just screwed
in.
&gt; While I'm there with the speedo out, though, I'd really like to replace
the
&gt; colored plastic bits.  Is there an easy way to get something that'll work
or
&gt; do I have to hunt?  If I have to hunt, where should I start?
&gt;
&gt; I know this has been discussed before, but I couldn't find anything in the
&gt; archives.  Thanks for any help!
