Subject: RE: [VB] more on roof racks

  I have had no problems or complaints on the new EMPI racks, I have sold 26
of them and only on 2 of them have there been any problems and that was just
a couple missing pieces, which EMPI promptly replaced.

Subject: [VB] more on roof racks


Speaking of roof racks, is anyone using the new? roof rack made by EMPI? It
seems EMPI is trying to make parts of acceptable quality again.  I just
wonder if their rack is acceptable or just junk?   It is priced better than
the parts-is-parts rack, plus does not need modified to fit a double cab.
Also, years ago, I heard bad reviews of the PIP rack.  I assume they have
honed their craft as they are still selling them.
