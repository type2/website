Subject: Drakula--a Useful Bus!

Drakula actually is a very useful unique bus--The single cab is still under the
Black Box--
When Magoo and i do local swap meets--we put all our tables in the lower
compartment, and because the inside is all in hammered aluminum, we fill up the
interior with all of the stuff to sell! Drakula actually holds more than our
Ch*vy Ast*o Van!! but with a bone stock 40 horse speed is out of the
question--But then, when used as a Hearse, the person inside is in no hurry
anyway--Blue Nelson, at the Jerome Jamboree is still the only person to spend
the night sleeping inside the Black Box--Was really hoping to find some sort of
Museum for Drakula--I brought him for the German Mobile Museum in 1997 with just
under 19,000Km--thats about 325 miles a year he was driven. Since then i have
put on about 8000KM--Drakula should really be in a display--Yes, I do have a
list a VW People who have requested Drakula for their Last Ride--But just like
my appraisals,
it is always Free!   6/12/63 is his birthday--I will continue to drive
Drakula--as he is one of the most solid splitties i have ever driven--and a hit
on Halloween--Hopefully in time something can be worked out for a new
home--untill then--Drive-Um!!  TWWM, uj
