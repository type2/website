&gt;My argument is that when ever I have dug into any vehicle that some PO has
&gt;attempted to modify the wiring, it is almost always a bad hack job...

Ah, OK.  I agree with you there.  I've had the same experience.  I have
often found that putting the wiring back close to stock was usually the
best plan.

&gt;I guess if you make sure you run a brown wire from the lights back to the
&gt;neg post I'd say that is better than some other misc colored wire.

That's what I ran.  I did use a black wire for one ground wire I added but
when I get another spool of brown it will change.  I like to run the
added grounds back to where the negative strap bolts to the body, just
because it's easier to get to and because the wires are not then subject
to the acid and hydrogen that likes to hang out near the top of the
battery.

&gt;Just think a week/month/year into the future and your trying to figure 
&gt;some other wiring problem out and you see this strange wire.

I'm right there with you on this one.

&gt;... currently fretting wire loom sheathing issues with a *new* repro
&gt;wire harness that is not close enough to my og wire harness [...]

Yours is old enough to have that woven cloth sheathing instead of the
plastic stuff, right?  Maybe you should roll your own.  :) 
http://store.yahoo_dot_com/delcity/wovcotfabloo.html may not be exactly right
but is similar to what I've seen for engine harnesses on older American
cars.  Del City also has nifty wire; standard PVC 165 F / 105 C stuff,
plus nice 305 F/175 C stuff.  They'll also stripe it for you for an
additional fee.  I don't work for them but I have ordered from them
before and gotten good service.
