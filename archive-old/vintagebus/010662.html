   You all may find this very hard to believe but several years ago while
looking to rejet a solex I was told that either suzuki or yamaha used the same
exact main jets in the carbs on there bikes.I went down to the local dealer
and sure enough found them to be an exact match,picked up several different
sizes and went home.
It was hard to believe that a motorcycle used some of the same sized jets as
my bus.

yup, and it's hard to believe that a motorcycle uses a motor bigger than in my
truck!  :)
