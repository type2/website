Subject: RE: Bus Engines


	Since everyone has been talking about engines lately what would
be a good size engine for a bus that needs to climb hills back and forth
from work each day. I have a 50 mile trip each day and my 1600dp doesn't
cut it with the grade and other hills I need to climb. I was thinking
something like a 1776 or 1914 dual port engine with a pict 34 or baby
dell's. Also who would be a good engine builder?


Thanks for your time
Eric Lykens
65 Deluxe 21 (Soon to get a used 1600dp engine)
67 Deluxe 13 (Soon to get a new ????dp engine)
