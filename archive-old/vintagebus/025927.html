The Phoenix Bug-O-Rama was pretty good this time.

I was able to pick up a few things, all my big dollars went to VWHoward so he definately has some Kelley Park gas money.  ;)  A few real nice guys from New Mexico showed up and brought me free parts for helping them sell Buses on my web site.  Cool, thanks again!  Phoenix is definately safer than CA, one of them just left a 36hp carb. sitting next to my tire and no one swiped it...  

Not too many Buses in the show area but there was a very interesting slammed panel, blue, that had had the whole subframe cut out and rebuilt out of square tube frame, it was insane how low it was, I believe the front bumper was sitting on the pavement.  Would definately make any vintage pervert puke.  It was on air bags, as well.

In the cars for sale area, there was a nasty '60 Single Cab, custom side scoops, fender flares front and rear, some sort of partially assembled Porsche engine in it, primered, only $4500!  Hahaha!  The thing that sucked was the guy had a set of '52 smooth side gates on it that he found at a dealership.  Apparently they were using them for shelves.  Crazy.  I told him to take those gates off there and sell them separately, he didn't seem to think that was viable...

In my continuing search for an all-original '55 Barndoor engine compartment, I picked up a 54-55 only fuel pump, decent condition.  I think Richard of rustybus fame thought I paid too much but go find me another one...  I spent an hour Sunday cleaning it up and installing a new diaphram using carb. cleaner, a toothbrush, and some $2 swap meet dental tools I have, looks and works awesome now.

Ronnie made a comment that I must almost have all the parts I need for my Bus and I realized he's right, I'm expecting to have all the parts together by this year's Classic, not sure I'll have all the money needed for my full resto, though...

On the way back, my oil light never came on at idle so I'll consider my sender problems solved, for now.

Next weekend - Kelley Park
