Subject: timer switch for heater

So does anyone know of any sort of switch that has a timer built in
that I can use to control my gas heater? I have a late bay timer
switch, however this thing is quite a bear to understand. I was hoping
for something to just set the timer and close a contact. There will
not be much current running through it b/c it only controls the relay
on the heater itself.
