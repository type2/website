Subject: So Cal VW weekend (VW Jamboree)
Message-ID: &lt;eb7c841.245f8399_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

We checked out the VW Jamboree this weekend.  Probably against our better
judgement, but there'd be all the &quot;maybe there was a/an (_____) there&quot; if we
hadnt gone.  In my opinion no where near worth the nearly $25 entrance fee
($12 each).

Show summed up as follows:

Highlights (depending what you go to shows for):

*67 Westy with approx 8700 original (no typo) miles.  I'd never seen a tent
so clean.

* 2 Puck Style trailers.  One was a minit (sp) and I dont know what the other
was.  One was towed behind a delux and painted to match.  The other was
brought by an early single cab (58 maybe?) and was for sale for $3500.

* 64 13 window all original deluxe.  94,000 miles, original paint (looked
brand new) original engine, original Como Green (I think) interor with only
the seats having been recovered.  Owned by a nice guy who bought it for $1500
&gt;from the typical &quot;old guy/couple&quot;/  Had original window sticker with options
listed.  He said he'd had offers of $18K for it, but that it wasnt for sale.
That made me feel good.

Low Lights (also depending what you go to shows for):

Terrible event organization.  Poor layout and cars not lined up according to
voting class.  There wasnt enough room for everyone and I think some cars
were turned away.  There were very few bathrooms and when we first entered we
had to walk around for 15 minutes just to find a trash can.

*music was WAY too loud.  I couldnt think let alone ask any questions about
people's cars.  The promoter/announcer was a tool too (not Dyno Don, but the
guy that introduced that band???  please!!

*Playboy booth/models....you could get your clendar signed......oooohhh!!

*Bikini contest

*Pink and white deluxe that was the biggest trailer queen I've ever seen.
There's NO way this bus would run and it's probably never been driven.  Had
more mirrors in/on/under it that Heff's mansion.  Sorry if the owner's on the
list, but that bus was terrible.

*swap area was TINY, but I guess that's not the show's fault.

Funny lights:

There was a guy in the swap area selling a 68/69 Ghia with a &quot;Clan&quot; interior.
 We guessed that meant it was white.

We also saw a young asian guy who was buying parts hand over fist.  He had a
pink pair of Rex's VW coveralls on with a guillermo patch on them.  Just
struck us as funny.


If I'm not mistaken there are 2 VW Jamborees in So Cal.  One in May and one
in August?  We made the Augist one last year and it was pretty much the same.
 I dont think we'll be back to either next year.
