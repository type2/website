Subject: Re: [VB] selling your bus

Gloria,

WOW, someone who has owned their bus longer than I. I inherited mine from my
Dad in 1972.
Drove it until 1995 when I got an f#*d r*ng*r. Got mine restored about 2
years ago now at ISP West. They did a great job.

Chris

&gt; Hi..I am still new to this site, but I am an old VW Bus owner. I have a
1966
&gt; Bus, since 1971, and I ALMOST sold it in 1982. I was going off travelling
for
&gt; 2 years, and the person was supposed to come give me money, and the deal
fell
