&gt;Did a shake down drive on the freeway this morning&gt;&gt;&gt;


Hey Steve,

It sounds like your flywheel seals are leaking.  I had the exact same
problem on my '67 westy (with a 1600DP).  I found on mine that there was an
o-ring missing that goes near the center.  I bought a complete seal kit (it
was cheap) and replaced all of the seals for the flywheel (and installed the
one o-ring that wasn't there) and haven't had any problems yet.
    As for the flickering oil light, sounds like you have low oil pressure
(had this problem too).  After the oil warms up at highway speeds it becomes
thinner, then cools down when driving locally. As for the cause- hard to
tell. Could be oil pump, blocked passages, etc.  But what I did was change
the oil and ran Castrol 20W50 in it and it solved the problem, but obviously
not permanently.
    As for the hard starting, I could only guess as to the cause.
Maladjusted valves, tune-up required....?
