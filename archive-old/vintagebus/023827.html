Hello,
I'm hoping for advice on the value of a splittie that's for sale.  It's
a std 1967 that's basically complete and original.  It's in good shape
inside and has virtually everything, even the middle seat and the mats
BUT it does have rust on the driver's floor panel and by the double
doors.  This has been &quot;treated&quot; to keep it at bay for a time.  There is
also a bit along the bottom of the left side..not apparent till you're
up close and it looks like there's a bit of separation along the bottom
but it's a small area.  The original engine is there and has been
rebuilt.  A mechanic is going over the van now and I've only had the
chance to look at it briefly and should be able to drive it this week.
The front end was recently rebuilt.  The owner says it runs and drives
great but is leaking oil a bit and he thinks the engine will need to be
rebuilt again at some point fairly soon.  More advice/status to follow 
from the mechanic.  The rear bumper has a big ding and the bus itself
has a small ding by the bumper.  The owner is the 4th owner, having
owned it for 10 years, and the bus has 162k on it.  My question is
this...what do you think is a reasonable price to offer him based on the
info here?  He's selling it because he needs money and wants to see the
bus restored but obviously he can't do that anytime soon.
TIA,
Andrea
