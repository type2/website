Subject: Re: [VB] Oi, that's 'Sigthing', NOT 'siting'

Bus content: I put my '63 DC up on TheSamba (thanks, Everett!) and got inquiries 


from France, Hawaii and California. 


Took a trip to Big Sur this weekend. Lots of VW campers but only one splitty 


sighting, a blue and white with a spare on it's nose.
