Subject: RE: [VB] RE: Oil opinions/proof

   I just took my 1776 single port apart to replace the thrust bearing (I
hammered it out!) after 50,000 plus miles. This engine has been in 5
different buses over the last 4 years and to my amazment it still had the
cross hatch in all the cylinders and no ridge in the cylinders! This engine
has custom built single post big valve heads, 7 to 1 compression,
counterweighted crank and SCAT rods, custom grind cam from CB and Wizeman
German cam followers. This engine has been run HARD!!!! (ask anybody who
knows me) always pulling loads and/or loaded down buses.
   What is the point, well I have a CB filter pump on it, run 87 octane fuel
have used duel Kadrons and a single 34 pict 3 on it, change the oil after
every long trip or 2500 miles and have used nothing but VAVOLINE Racing
straight 40 weight in the summer and 30 weight in the winter,no gauges, did
I mention I use a type 3 tight finned oil cooler (no type 4 for me) and I am
convinced that they work!. This engine looks just like new inside!!!

  Low compression, OIL CHANGES, good oil seem to make a difference.

ronnie

ps. no flaps either
pps. Just for the heck of it I am going to take the 1800 stroker apart to
take a look see, It has 20K on it and always ran MOBIL 1 15/50 in it with
the type3 tight finned cooler and filter pump (CB of course)

&gt; Also, those infra red temp guns are not like pointing a gun, and
&gt; reading a pin-point temp. Last one I looked at, the area read was

&gt; away. How accurate do you think the readings were? 

about the ir guns. I borrowed a decent one from work &amp; am looking at
it right now. the spread on it is nothing like you remember eric. Mine
says 1.5&quot; at 12&quot; distance. So it is more accurate than you think, that
being said. it's just external temps, so take it w/ a grain of salt. I
do find it funny that that rag keeps flip/flopping on the synth topic.
one month it talks about how bad synth is then next its the greatest
thing since sliced bread. But then again if you believe everything you
read......
