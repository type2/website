Subject: City Gives My Bus the BOOT!
Message-ID: &lt;3716D575.CAE44055_at_dolphinsci_dot_com&gt;

I got a letter in the mail to day from my city watchdogs and it seems
that I am in violation of not one but three city sections by parking my
truck in the driveway.  I guess the clincher was the non-op German NSU
parked along side it and under a tarp.  I have 10 days to get them out
of the driveway or &quot;face further legal action&quot;.

&gt;From what I gather, some neighbor complained about me and my next door
neighbor.  They claimed that next door was running an auto repair
business and I was storing vehicles for him.  The inspector showed up
and happened to run into my neighbor and he headed her off with respect
to his property (she's also the street sweeper ticketer and said she
goes by all the time and doesn't see any auto repair business going
on).  So the neighbor escapes and I get zapped.

I have room on the side of my house  to move the NSU (its really small),
but  I have to tear down a new fence that I just put up two months ago
in order to get it back there.  I'm going to have to fight them on the
Double Cab.  Its currently registered, just waiting for parts from all
over the place to put back together.

I think the whole thing stems from my neighbor's son who finds a bus
about once every other month, gets a few parts off it and then resells
it to someone else.  His buddies have been tearing up the neighborhood
with their tires as they come and go and someone got tired of it.
Teenagers! (yep, I was one once).

I'm just pissed that I'm the one that got the violation notice.

I guess its going to be a busy weekend not to mention that I'm going to
have to hurry up on that Type IV conversion I'm working on.
