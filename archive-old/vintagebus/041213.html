Subject: Bug-O-Rama and Thom

------=_NextPart_001_0005_01C13486.3AAA8400

All in all Bug-O-Rama was a good outing for me. I sold the '59 Walkthru w=
ithin minutes of arriving Saturday afternoon. $500 was just that good of =
a price I guess. =20

I have a feeling that the guy that &quot;paid&quot; me for it isn't the actual buye=
r, I saw someone I will refer to as Mr. M. mulling around and looking at =
it pretty hard Sunday afternoon. Like he was evaluating his new purchase =
and didn't want me to know he bought it. Who cares!!! Like I said before =
if your money is green I'll take it!!

On another note, a BIG thank you goes out to Thom!!

Here's why............

I drove my Single Cab to the show and my girlfriend drove my newly acquir=
ed DD Walkthru EZ Camper, while a buddy towed the for sale '59 and hauled=
 the swap stuff in my International. Since the '59 had sold we (my girlfr=
iend) decided it would be a better trip home in one car together. So we h=
ooked the Camper to the tow rig and her and I rode in the Single. We left=
 the show and went to Thom's to have a look t his '55 Single which is goi=
ng to another friend that was with us. On our way there we were flagged d=
own by a VW in need. We stooped and they needed a fan belt. &quot;Sorry no ext=
ras&quot;, I say. Embarrassed that I *don't* have one. &quot;What about on the Camp=
er?&quot;, my girlfriend says. So I pulled the belt off the Camper give it to =
him and away we go to Thoms.

While leaving Thoms house my buddy in the tow rig pulls off a very nice t=
ight U-turn at the end of the block, bending the heck out of the tow bar =
(which he doesn't notice until we hit a main street and get some speed bu=
ilt up.

To make a long story short one phone call to Thom and a couple minutes la=
ter we have a Bus tow bar and are putting it on the Camper (with no fan b=
elt) and our on our way home.

Many thanks again Thom! =20
I'll see you next week to return the tow bar and pick up a Single Cab.
