----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; i don't even own any other kind of car, so what 
&gt; else WOULD i drive?!


How about a Harley-Davidson?  :)

Seriously, I look forward to *being able to* drive
the bus on a daily basis, as I still need to install the 
windshields (after redoing the channels) and finish up
the electrics. The bus is registered, tagged, and, yes,
insured!  Thought about putting on my riding goggles
and cruise to work, but I'm sure some local cop would
not see the humor in that. 
There is one other bus locally that I see running around
town...my heart piddi-patts whenever I see going by...
Oh, well...I guess I'll just have to suffer and ride my
1964 all-original Harley-Davidson DuoGlide to work
until then... Hoo-humm...
