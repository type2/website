Subject: [VB] re: Swing lever kit troubles

&gt;&gt; I have installed the bushings I sell in over 10 beams my self and do not
know how many kits I have sold in the last few years and have never heard of
this problem. I currentley have 2 different German brads in stock and some
OG (NOS) bushings I can measure against to see of their is a manufacturers
problem
&lt;&lt;

ronnie -

I'm not accusing you of having wrong bushing parts!! Only put that info for matt in case he wanted to find out if has used the bushing kit you sell.  

Believe me my bus has been through a hard life, I am very sure I have worn beam opening!!

I love oldvolks_dot_com !!
