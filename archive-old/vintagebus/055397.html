Subject: Clutch/pressure plate locked together

A friend of mine has his '67 bus stored for long periods of time. Once he
starts it up and gets going in first, a &quot;delicate&quot; operation of stomping on
the brake with the clutch in usually gets the pressure plate and clutch
unlocked so they work properly.

Is this a simple matter of a new clutch/pressure plate combo or are there
other remedies/ causes of this??

Scott
