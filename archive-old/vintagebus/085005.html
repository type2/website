I want  to go faster and run a little cooler... Will my 1500 have trouble 
pushing the  3.88? Any experiences...



Hi Eric,
We will Pmail you our &quot;Modified Tranny History&quot;.  As for  &quot;will 1500 have 
trouble pushing&quot;, it depends on your personal need for  speed, HP, torque, and 
hill climbing ability.  We would suggest a  1641cc (or bigger) fully balanced.
