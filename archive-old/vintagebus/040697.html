Solder or leading as I have heard it called.  Leading is a true art.  There
is a fine line between &quot;sweeeeeet&quot; and a puddle of lead on the floor.

&gt; Most likely this guy is talking about &quot;hammer welding&quot;.  It is a process
of
&gt; straightening sheet metal with out using filler. Someone who is 'really&quot;
good
&gt; can get away with almost no filler at all.  It involves heating the metal
up
&gt; and hammering it in conjunction with a back up dolly.

Could be that he was talking about using solder for filler. When you use
solder, you use a wooden paddle to &quot;press&quot; the solder into the defect in the
metal. Ask him specifically what &quot;pressing&quot; is.
