Hi All.

I'm putting the front beam back together on the 59 dc and when I went to put
the torsion arms back on, one side slid on but the other seems a bit tight.
I did mark them for left/right side and they don't appear to be real worn.

How tight should they be????  The manual doesn't say nor do they give any
specs.


TIA
David
