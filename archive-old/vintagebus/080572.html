Subject: 010 versus 019 Dizzy

Well I putting together the 2007 this week and need to know which dizzy you 
all would run on a Westi running IRS (super beetle tranny).

I would rather run the 010 (with both springs) because it is a bit more 
rare, and I have not tried it before... But I know that a 019 will be a 
great job.

Which dizzy curve do you all like in a bus?

... Perhaps the 010 with one spring?  Granted &quot;all in&quot; would be at like 20 
degrees!

Thanks,
Adrian Pillow
