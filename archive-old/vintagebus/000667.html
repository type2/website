 Hit every bump, etc. you can find in the road. It would come off that way if
 you were in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night and the nut came
 loose right?? Just play it safe and leave the cotter key in too keep the drum
 from falling off..........8-) &gt;&gt;

Hi Greg,
We tried this once.  After 800 miles the drum was still tight.  Finally 
rented a puller for $7.00, and removed it after having to pull it every mm 
off of the axle.
