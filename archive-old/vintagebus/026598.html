&gt; What of the multi rated oils that are GL4/GL5?
&gt; 
&gt; If I drain the tranny and add the GL4 with that be enough to remove the
&gt; offending chemical?

Just replace it when you can.
The best explanation I ever heard was Bob Hoover's, which to paraphrase
from my own limited memory goes something like this:
VW engineers got cheap. Used a very crappy alloy for synchros. happened
sometime early 60's. Gear oil makers got fancy. Put new chemicals in.
Synchros showed signs of greater wear with new stuff. VW, instead of
changing to the better brass alloys in most synchros, just put out a
warning to use only gl-4 gear oil. 
So...you may or may not have the synchros that are succeptible to this
problem. Even if you do, it isnt the kiss of death. Just change the
stuff when you can and worry about it no more. 

Anyone ever hear the VW Serenity Prayer?

God Grant me the serenity 
To drive at aircooled speeds,
The courage to downshift on a grade
with an SUV on my bumper,
And the wisdom to do my maintainance
*before* I leave home.
