Hi Thom,
If CE ones are made of aluminum it will be interesting to see if they have 
the strength of the originals.  Eric's father was a mechanical engineer.  
According to him one doubled aluminum thickness to get same strength as 
steel, but with 1/3 less wieght.

&gt; The cheep repros have a flat-bottom frame.
&gt; These have been well known to be flimsy due to only being one walled.  To 
the point when one goes over a bump in the road with windows open, to flex 
enough at the slider arm pivot points to crank/break the glass in half in 
them.
