Hi Joel,
If you maen that kind of T-brass fitting.  We use these and have calibrated 
our temp sender in it with a mechanical temp sender through the dipstick hole 
into the sump.  Have found no differance between them!  We also hand machine 
this T-shaped brass fitting so as to install the temp sender while the 
pressure idiot light sender and pressure gauge senders thread into the 
already drilled and tapped holes.  Thus making it an X-brass fitting!
