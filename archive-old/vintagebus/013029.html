&gt; seems that some people like to carry spare parts and

&gt; emergency, feel comfortable with doing emergency bus
&gt; repair, and can

&gt; Others find it impossible to believe that spare
&gt; parts and tools can be packed 
&gt; compactly, and  prefer the cell phone / AAA deal to
&gt; get it towed to where 
&gt; someone else will fix it,
&gt; 
&gt;      I don't understand the sneering about it, 
&gt; these buses are over 30 years 
&gt; old, and things break, amazingly enough, even on
&gt; well maintained vehicles.
&lt;snip&gt;    

IMHO
For what its worth.... Im with you:) These are older
machines, &amp; things are gonna break. Shoot, things
break on bran new cars:) As far as packin stuff, if
your careful, you can get alot of tools &amp; parts in an
area the size of a bus:)
 Now before I start gettin mail saying &quot;How do you
know, youve never owned one!&quot; Weve done a lot of
trippin over the lower 48 over the years. In the B*g
(daily), ya need simple things for in town...those are
the give mes, belt, cables, dist, ect...
When I made the journey to Ponca City, It was the VWs
first trip out of town. Wont go into the flat in the
middle of no where, or how said flat ripped every wire
&gt;from under the fender, or how the temp was near
freezing w/high winds &amp; rain, or...you get the point.
Ok...'72 Standard B*g...
 3 drawer toolbox FULL of parts &amp; tools, From axle
bearings to spare zerts. 2 man tent, 2 ice chests,
coleman stove(that one guy got a kick out of me as I
made coffee, eggs, toast, gravy, &amp; bacon in the front
seat:) THICK cover-alls, clothes, toiletries(sp),
water, spare gas, 2 1/2 ton high lift floor jack(in
trunk w toolbox, and for B.H...even my Starrett mic
set, never know:) And most of the spares volks already
listed.
 I guess what Im tryin to say, If you have spare space
in your VW, make use of it. Id rather not need it &amp;
have it, than to need it &amp; not have it:)
 Wait till I get my bus... theres a place for the
welder, generator, torches, 12 ton press,
roll-away..... yea right:)

P.S. FWIW the car wasnt unsafe in any manner. It would
still seat 2, and not one window was obstructed from
view, and I dont think I was over loaded:)
