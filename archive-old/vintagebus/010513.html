Subject: [VB] brazil case, no thermostat hole

Well my new engine is in and purring like a kitten, what a great feeling.
Anyway the case is from brazil and it doesnt have a hole for the thermostat
mount, i need a bracket to attach between the 2 cheese screws,  has someone
on the list made one of these?   If so any suggestions would be appreciated,
a good pic would be cool , or perhaps someone could make me one for a fair
price?

I will humbly admit to the list that this is the first time in 10 years of
vw driving that ive ever tried to hook up the thermostat, it seems a bit
ironic that the engine i bought doesnt have the hole. With a good tight new
engine you can really feel it warming up, :o).

Also i highly reccomend the guy ive been dealing with in Louisiana, very
good prices and very fast shipping, way cheaper than the flaps, and he deals
with all the wcm, ww, empi , all that, pmail me if you re in the southeast
and ill give you his info.

Also if you find yourself cruising down I-10 through mobile this summer ,
look me up  in AIRS and stop by .
