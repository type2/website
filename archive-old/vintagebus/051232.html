Subject: Re: [VB] Bus clock help.  any experts out there?

I have a good article from the May 1992 issue of
&quot;Skinned Knuckles&quot;, a good car restoration magazine,
that I could scan and send you, but basically, as I
recall from working on Studebaker clocks, it doesn't
push the winding mechanism very far when the points
touch.  How long does it run between the solenoid
activation?  Also, yes, usually those hands (arms?)
just are a press fit, and you very carefully pull them
off.

Hope this helps.  P-mail for a copy of the article.

&gt; 1.  When the solinoid is activated, it only pushes
&gt; the
&gt; primary tension spring disk back about 45 degree's. 
&gt; That is about 1/4&quot;.  The travel on that disk is
&gt; about
&gt; 3 times that.  I realize that the solinoid is
&gt; basically just throwing the disk back against the
&gt; tension spring, but shouldnt it go farther then
&gt; that?


&gt; 2.  I have the bezzle off (Found a clever way of
&gt; removing that W/O damaging it if anyone is
&gt; interested)
&gt; I need to repaint the small center square plate
&gt; under
&gt; both arms as well as the clock arms.  How do you
&gt; remove those arms?  Looks like they are pressed on,
&gt; but i do not want to venture that far w/o some
&gt; guidance.
