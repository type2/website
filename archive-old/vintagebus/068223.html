Subject: Re: [VB] upper  engine bolt.  aaargh

I say put the insert in. It's easy and saves a lot of time in the long run. While the engine is out remove a little material from the trans housing around the bolt hole so that you can fully tighten the bolt after you get the engine in. I can reach mine with a 17mm socket on an extension with little twisting. I still have to hit it with a box wrench but it's not a real problem if you removed a little material.
 The real problem is that I cleaned my starter bolt and now it always slid out! I should have left it dirty.
