&gt;&gt; [using a box and a pencil to measure runout on a rim]
&gt;
&gt; Bob Hoover describes this method for blueprinting rims in the TULZ
&gt; series he posted to ramva back in 2000.  You can find it by doing a
&gt; google groups search for 'veeduber tulz'.

That's where I read it.  It's &quot;TULZ - Part nine&quot; if anyone else wants to
check.  That's also where I got the idea that it's easy to bend a wide-
five rim.

&gt; Enco sells an imported dial indicator and magnetic base for around
&gt; $20, which would be easier and more precise than the pencil and
&gt; feeler gauge technique.

I already own the pencil and feeler gauges, though.  :)  Plus, it seems
to me like the pencil thing would tend to catch most of the drums and
rims that are _really_ out of spec; the dial indicator would be useful
for catching the borderline cases.
