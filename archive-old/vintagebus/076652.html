Subject: Re: [VB] Insulation?

When I was young we had a Hillman Imp in the UK.  We had another
couple for spares, and I spent many days tearing them apart.  Inside the
door cavities were ssealed and shaped plastic bags filled with fiberglass.
That way the nooks and crannies were filled, and the fiberglass never got
wet
and was no impediment to draining rain through the door.  I am planning
to make some of this style of bag for my '67 deluxe. 3 mil sheeting
could be used to make the bags, sealed either with plenty of tape
or plastic welded.

POR15 on the inside faces of the door is a given, and a single sheet
of 3mil plastic for a moisture barrier behind the door panel.

Tom.

&gt; Has anyone else used this loose styrofoam beads in a bag method? Think it
is a good idea?
