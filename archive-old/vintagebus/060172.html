Subject: [VB] powdercoating pop out window frames


&gt; Has anyone powdercoated their popout frames?  Any Pluses or Minuses of
&gt; having this done?  Specifically I am wondering if the powder coat will be
&gt; thick enough to make them difficult to put back together.

The difficulty encountered when powdercoating pop-out window frames
involves the Faraday Cage Effect, wherein the charged powder is repelled
from reflecting surfaces. The inner / outer channels have a hard time receiving
powder. This is a technical application problem , especially on the outer
channel,
where the edge is rolled. They will assemble with the same normal difficulty.
