The Big Kansas City MoKan Trip - Part 2
================================

 The trip started out Friday evening June 9th.  I had taken off the 8th and
9th from work to assist in volunteer church work which consisted of building
a meeting place in 4 days!  After helping out in the morning of the 9th, I
came home and started running the errands which usually precursor a trip of
several days.  I wired in a cigarette adaptor to charge the cell phone and
installed my custom Type2 popcan holder (A BIG thanks to the guy that made
these.  I can't remember his name or email address but I bought one of the
last gray ones he had and man did this work great.  It fastens under the
dash and is basically a rubber coated metal frame which supports a popcan.
It's a cool accessory than Dan Kinsey doesn't actually have! (Sorry Dan -
had to toss that one in there.)) :-)  I also packed a whole bunch of tools,
the welder, spare parts, rags, tools, pop, cooler, etc.  - you know the
whole thing...  Rob and Justin Laffoon headed down here from Omaha in Rob's
$200 std. yellow beetle.  He showed up at about 8:00 and we headed out to
Walmart to grab a pair of Bellsouth 1010 FRS radios which were on sale for
$24.97 each.  I really suggest these radios for small caravans and shows.
We talked on the road while we were traveling - joking, laughing, pointing
out stuff before the other one saw it and then at the show we could wander
all around whereever we liked and didn't have to do the &quot;I'll meet you here
at 12:00 routine.&quot;

 Next we needed to fuel up Rob's bug.  I was a little worried that we were
getting such a late start but then again, it would net us cooler air and
when caravanning and embarking on a new adventure - the andrenalin works
wonders at keeping you awake.
At about 8:30 or so, I bucked a straight and strong headwind on U.S. 77
South with with Rob and Justin at my backside.  We were doing our little
weaving dance in the wind all the way down to highway 36 in Marysville, KS.
Our destination this night was at Dan Buser's house in Cameron, MO.  We
stopped for gas and eats at a Casey's and we were off, arriving in Cameron a
white knuckled 3 hours later at 11:50.  Justin rode shotgun with me from
Marysville on and what a wild crosswind ride that was!  It was along this
stretch of road where Rob was able to snap pictures of my bus going down the
road and me with a big smile on my face.  The radios came into play as we
were doing our highway coreography!  The strong southwind really was a force
to be reckoned with but we defied nature and wheeled into SONIC drive-in for
a later meal.  We had 5 minutes to order before they closed so we
spontaneously placed our orders and then called Dan Buser to let him know we
were in town.  We ate, talked, watched the clouds dance around the moon, put
a hose clamp on Rob's fuel line where it almost came off, and with a belch
and a fart, headed off the 10 blocks to Dan's house.

 Dan had evidently came out to meet us since a phone call he was waiting for
had arrived and so it happened that we all showed up at his house at the
same time.  Not being one to refuse red carpet treatment, I rolled right on
into the open garage door and parked.  Dan was as glad to see us as we were
him.  The remaining hour of the evening was spent trying to chat, look at
magazines, watch a video and get caught up on a years worth of VDubbing.  We
finally hit the sack, knowing that the show was only hours away.  Rob and
Justin slept in the open back yard with the stars for nightlights and I
chose the comfort of a window, 2 fans, and a hide-a-bed.  I'm a softy I
know. :-)
