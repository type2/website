For future reference, I do have the seal holders for the early nosecones and
also have an adapter I have had made to bush out the large nosecone to use
the early seal holder.

Sort of.  From May 59- approx 62, the nosecones had 8mm stud holes for the
front mount.  After that they had 10mm stud holes.  Somewhere around 65 they
started putting a brass seal holder and rubber seal on the front of the
nosecone for the hockey stick. The seal holders are not available anymore
(and not the same as bug ones), so if you have one, make sure to keep it in
good shape.  The seals are replaceable and the same as bug.  Late 67
nosecones had a hole for the reverse light switch.  You can use any tunnel
type nosecone from a bus on a tunnel type tranny, just make sure to get the
right mount for the nosecone, and if it has a seal be SURE to replace it
before putting your tranny back in. Jon
