An increasing number of people on the list have actually met me, mostly
those in the southeast as I hail from Dahlonega, GA.  Most probably don't
know that I can be an outrageously good slacker.  I picked up the art of
Slack after my senior year of high school.  Imagine, if you will, a
slacker-geek-physics-major.  Thaz me.  Oh yeah, and I love my computers,
too.  Generally I'm pretty diligent about VW repairs, as I rely on my
vehicles to get me where I need to be...reliably!  But I slacked a bit
recently (sigh) and almost blew myself up.

It all started innocently enough.  As it grew warmer, the Kombi began to
have some exciting problems coming down from full-speed operation.  The
weather turned out to be coincidental -- but I didn't know that at the time
:-)  The problem was that the engine would stall when the pedal was released
after travelling for a period at high revs.  To start it, one had to simply
turn the key, not touching the gas...vroom, right back to a steady idle.  To
tell the truth, it rather pissed me off :-)  I looked in the Orange Beetle
Bentley (tm) as I was working with a dual-port engine.  There was a symptom
in the carb troubleshooting that fit my situation: it said I was running too
rich at idle.  So I leaned it down.  It got worse.  I readjusted the idle by
the book, it still did it.  I fumed for a while, and in the process went to
the Farmington, NC show -- a trip of several hundred miles.

On the way, the problem got on my nerves a bit.  I was mortified that the
other bus drivers in the caravan would hear me cranking the engine at
stop-lights on the way home ;-)  Nobody _said_ anything, but I confronted
Dave Easterwood with my problem while at the event.  He said that the fuel
pump pressure might be too high, or my float needle valve might not be
working right; both causing an overflow of gas from the high-rev to idle
transition, stalling the engine.  I decided to check that next.

This is where slack kicks in.  It took me about two weeks to get around to
checking it.  Heat with humidity just saps me -- I prefer to work on a car
in the dead of winter to in the humid Georgia clime.  I drove the bus to and
from work and school, the problem annoying (I fiddled with the idle
adjustment at nearly every stop), but not annoying enough for me to fix it
in that heat.  No thought of getting up early ;-)  So I just drove it, until
it started getting _worse_.  It finally got bad enough on Tuesday that I
parked the bus and drove my &quot;spare,&quot; an '86 Che*y Spec.

Today, I took the carb off and tore it down.  I had three or four old needle
valves in the bus, they were all good (couldn't blow through with the pin
gravity-closed) so I picked one.  Turned the top of the carb over, blew
through the fuel inlet -- couldn't do it!  The one on the carb was fine.
Checked the float...no gas in it.  Everything looked cool.  There was even a
supply of gas in the bowl after sitting for a few days, so it wasn't just
running dry.  There was *no* crud in the bowl or anywhere else, or in the
fuel filter for that matter.  Perplexed, I put it back together, and put it
on the engine...and noticed the idle cutoff was a little jiggly.

Wait...a LOT jiggly.  Like, it's-about-to-come-out jiggly!  You can't really
see it when it's on the car.  I traced in my mind the results of it coming
out...gas on the distributor cap.  Fuel lines go up.  Fuel lines lead to the
gas tank, with all that lovely 87 octane sloshing around.  Bye-bye bus.  I
tightened it several turns(!), snugged it, and fired it up.  Idled a great
deal smoother, imagine that!  Seemed to idle really high once it got going.
Gee.  ;-)

Well that's a lot of crap I've typed...the point being, I guess, don't slack
on your driver!!  I drove _hundreds_ of miles with that thing hanging on by
a few threads.  I've never had one come loose before, to my credit (err)...I
clamp every hose in the engine compartment.  But rest assured I'll be
checking the damn idle cutoff at every gas stop from now on!

Cya at the Marietta show Saturday, in my non-barbequed Misato ;-)
