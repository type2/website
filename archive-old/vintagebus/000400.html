&lt;&lt; I am going to get a 17mm allen wrench tomorrow and make sure everything is 
snug. Should I consider the use of a thread sealant to prevent leaks and 
losening or will proper torque take care of it? Also wondering if the use of 
GL5 is a contributing factor? &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
The plugs are tapered so snugging them should do, but do not over tighten or 
risk cracking the box/tranny.  GL-5 should not affect the seals, but is not 
good for your syncros!  Most likely you need to rebuild the reduction boxes 
seals, and/or the reduction bearings.   Eric&amp;Barb
