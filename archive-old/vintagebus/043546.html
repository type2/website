&gt;Carb *icing* is usually the term used. [...]  The solution is to have 
&gt;the pre-heat tube unclogged, and any warm air hoses hooked up.

Carb icing is more of a problem when it's cool and humid outside.
This happens a lot in the UK.  I have seen a device advertised, the
&quot;Snug Bug&quot; IIRC, in Volks World (UK VW mag).  It's basically a little
electric blanket that wraps around the intake manifold under the
carb and attaches to the hot-in-run wire at the coil.  I don't know
if it has any further thermostat control or a timer or what.

I agree with Thom that having the stock system intact and working
is the best solution, but in some climates, it may need a little help.
