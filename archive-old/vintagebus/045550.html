Subject: NEW FRONT SEAT!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Well, Finally got my &quot;new&quot; front seat back.
It may seem crazy, but I salvaged original materials to construct a new front 
seat for my standard.
Even used the original piping for the seams, had to put it in boiling water 
to make it pliable to sew through, but it worked.
Only thing I didnt like was how you can see the thread holes at the pleats.
Not sure if its possible to avoid this (Any ideas?)
Check out the picture:

I wish i had a before picture, but imagine EVERY seam was broken and the area 
under the drivers seat was NOT existent!

I also had another question.
Is my 57 supposed to have the rubber piece (Knee protector) under the 
steering wheel? 
Thanks-
Greg
