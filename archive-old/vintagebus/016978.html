Subject: post 71 MC upgrade

Hey all,

I going to attemp to do the post 71 MC upgrade on my 66 deluxe as explained 
by eric&amp;barb in the library.  I already got the MC, but to my supruise it 
did not come with the rubber boot that goes on the pushrod thing.  Is this 
normal?  My existing boot is pretty jank with cracks and obvious age.  Any 
recomendations?  I'm going to try to score a resorvoir today in a salvage 
yard, will most likely have to go for a rabbit one.

Oh yea one more question.  I put in a new outer rear axle seal in a couple 
weeks back and it is leaking again, I noticed my cv boot coming off the 
tranny center has a big tear in it.  Will this cause a nice spew of 
stay-lube on my backing plate?

Thanks,

Eric
66 deluxe
