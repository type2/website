Check the electric fuel cutoff switch on the left side of the carb.
Sometimes they get a little loose in the carb body due to engine
vibrations. They cause intermittent idle problems when they're loose. A
drop of the lightest grade locktite will keep them from getting loose.

&gt; I just got my '62 bus roadworthy again yesterday, in time for the 90+ degree

&gt; it's always run very well.   But occasionally it just refuses to idle.   As
&gt; soon as I take my foot of the gas, it stalls.
