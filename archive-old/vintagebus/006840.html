Most of the foo foo shows all these people are at anyway, Classic,
Barf-o-Rama's, but in my opinion again, I think that at OCTO (pre
Classic),would be the place to hold the First Annual Type 2 Concours, the
buses are there, the people are there, the need is there and a more then
qualified panel of Judges is also present, more then just the fab 5, the
magazines are there and a lot of big budget buyers who would pay ungodly
amounts of money to own a concours certified winner. 

ps. plus the pre Classic OCTO is Split buses only. no other bus or VW
product is allowed in.

So now that we've found the finest, are we going to fly the Fab Five to 
all the festivities?  That should be fun, but who will fund it?
