Alert!!!!

Don't sign ANY paper work until you have FULLY inspected the bus and are 
sure there was no addition damage.  Fine print on the paper work says &quot;any 
claims must be made with driver present and must be signed by driver&quot;.

I could have claimed my battery damage if I would have caught it.
