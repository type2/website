&lt;&lt; What is the red tube on one of the legs of the new heater control cable 
for?&gt;&gt;

Hi Gene,
That is a mystery to us to!
 
&lt;&lt;And also:  When the Bentley mentions a longer cable, how much longer is it?
 Is it really that hard to tell which end to put into the right-hand tube?  
They're really similar! &gt;&gt;

Really depends on wether it is a walk thru or not ando how the factory bent 
the cable.  We just install the cable and thread the control knob a turn or 
two.  Slide under the back to pull the slack out of the cable ends.  Measure 
them to make sure the ends are equal distance to the cable clamp cages.  If 
not equal go up front and rebend the cable to make them equal.  Make sure to 
only move this bend about half the needed distance differance you noted at 
the cable ends. IE if you noted 1/4&quot; you need to move the bend in the cable 
1/8&quot;.   Eric&amp;Barb
