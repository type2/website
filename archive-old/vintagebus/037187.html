WOW, sounds like a smoking deal at 4500$.
The new owner mentioned he had OVER 4500$ just in receipts and said he 
couldnt find some of the receipts for work done.
Why ask 8000$ all day long and take 4500$ at the end without making it known 
to the entire VW classic community?
Seems odd to me.

Id have to say between what was paid and what its worth are two different 
objects.
Ive paid 50 cents for something worth 20$, and 20$ for something worth 50 
cents.
I guess money invested is no longer relavent.

&gt; Wait, wasnt it for sale at the classic for 8000$?
Might have been the original asking price,

But i believe it sold at the classic for around $4,500 as the previous
owner was desperate to buy a 23 window and needed to unload the firetruck
to get it. I have heard all this thirdhand through the &quot;grapevine&quot; but am
pretty sure the number is close.

I really dont know what firetrucks are worth, and it looks like the new
owner has added some of the firetruck stuff it was missing, i just thought
it was worth mentioning... It seems nowadays if a bus ends up in
california the price automagically doubles for some reason...

take care,

Steve

p.s. the shop here in town that did all the mechanical work on that bus
has a good reputation. im sure its in great condition.
