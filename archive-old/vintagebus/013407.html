Yes; I have a set on my '56 kombi.  Bus rims probbaly
do the job better, but the bug wheels fit fine.  Bus wheels are
slightly wider.

&gt; Will early 15&quot; Beetle rims fit on a 63 Kombi.  The only reason I ask is that
&gt; my friend has 5 15&quot; beetle rims with the 5 bolt pattern just sitting in his
&gt; garage, if they will fit I think I'll put them to good use.
