Subject: More T4 2L gearing thoughts.

After reading what a lot of you had to say about the conversion of a bus to
IRS, I'm forced to go along with the idea that I've come to believe more
firmly in after this 1776/Freeway flyer conversion I've done to my bus.
That is, &quot;Keep it stock.&quot;  Not in a fanatical way mind you but to go with
what works and what is more easily fixable on the road as you travel.

I think the best bet is to get another freeway flyer transmission built but
this time with reinforcements to handle the increased torque from the T4 2L.
This way I'll be keeping the reduction boxes and have all kinds of grunt
power, even at cruise with a full load, to keep moving.  I want to be able
to pull a trailer through the mountains and have a load of gear in the bed
of the truck and not have to worry about my engine working too hard.  A T4
2L in a splitty with low gearing - wow - how much easier of a life can an
engine have? :-)

I also want my DC to be my rescue vehicle.  Meaning that if I find an old VW
in a field and want to tow it home on a trailer, the DC will be the vehicle
of choice - not some V8 Chevy truck that makes the VW in tow bow it's head
in shame and in acknowledgement that yes, the Chevy is the &quot;real&quot; work
truck.

I will still be able to cruise 70 to 75 if I want and have all kinds of
power loaded or unloaded.

Thanks for all the thoughts everyone.  It helped me make a good and informed
decision.
