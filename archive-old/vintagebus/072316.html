Subject: Re: [VB] NOS Barndoor wiper blades found.........

I found about 50 sets NOS Barndoor wiper blade this weekend. They have the 
arms, but no bases.
They are original SWF and still have soft and workable rubber on them.

My question, since I'm not a BARNDOOR guy is, what can these be SOLD for that 
is reasonable to both parties?
The reason I say SOLD, is I know I could price them at $XXXX.XX and sit on 
them forever, but that's not my style.

Thanks,
Greg
what makes you say they are barndoor?  the three ply rubber was not unique to 
barndoor.  what width are the arms?   what colour are the arms/blade?  Pics?

I would like to buy a spare pair of 53 and earlier passenger vehicle wiper 
arms and blades, though.
