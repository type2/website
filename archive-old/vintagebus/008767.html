&gt;Transmission rebuilding service offered
&gt;
&gt;With all the talk about having trouble finding anyone to rebuild trannys,
&gt;and the horrible service from those that have taken money and not delivered
&gt;the proper job, I have decided to offer my services.
&gt;
&gt;I read the Bentley tonight

&gt;Send your used transmission and the $300.00 in a check made out to CASH
&gt;(this will help on bookkeeping and save sales tax) to my partner:
