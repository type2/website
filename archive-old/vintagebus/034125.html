Subject: RE: [VB] Wiper Blades? what makes it  NOS

I guess in a sense the person selling NOS silver SWF wiper blades can call
them NOS, as they are not making silver ones anymore, just black blades.
Silver hasn't been available for a few months, so if you find Silver, SWF
blades for your bus BUY them, then you can say you have NOS Silver wiper
blades! Who puts the time on a part to make it NOS, is a old part that you
just found, or can it be anypart that is no longer manufactured,(reguardless
of when it was quit being made), meaning that the original part you just
found (that isn't being made anymore is NOS), but wait what happens when
they start making the part again (like 67 only masters) does that make your
recently purchased NOS part just a new part again???. I have stashed all my
Silver SWF wiper blades just in case they are never made again and in how
many years will I be able to call them NOS? I have had them for at least 3
years!.

By the way the guy selling the prop rods is a pretty nice guy, just making a
buck
where he can.  Can't blame him.

&gt; I keep seeing claims of &quot;NOS, No Longer Available&quot; for bus wiper blades on
eBay,

&gt;
&gt; And I'm getting a kick outta the guy who's selling an NOS engine lid prop
&gt; every 2 weeks; the last one I saw was up to $91.   The guy must have a
&gt; truckload of them, and driving it all the way to the bank...
