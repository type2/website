   well, i should clarify - for those who haven't eagerly opened EACH 
of my mails ;)
this is the SECOND aluminum case - the first had one too many nasty 
surprises and back it went... last straw was vomting sand into my 
bearings on startup.
&gt;
&gt;Raymond Heath had his mains line-bored .002&quot;
&gt;back to standard due to undersize main bearing
&gt;journals. This would display as a partial cut
&gt;if the journal was accurate but the edge was burred.
&gt;He didn't specify if the cut was .002&quot; total or
&gt;.002&quot; radius,

which is a good question... like i said, the guy at NWCR sounded 
surprised at the barrel shape; perhaps he had been assuming a 
consistently narrow bore, and this was an unsuspected flaw. raymond, 
why don't you quiz jerry on this next time you are out there?


&gt;or which mains were undersize.

#2, consistently.


&gt;Craig originally posted the cam gear getting tight
&gt;once in a full revolution, with no visible pattern
&gt;displayed on the soft cam gear, and no solution
&gt;reported.

again, old case.

&gt;Vendors have consistently stated that all issues
&gt;have been resolved, and many cases are in use
&gt;with no defects.

pure and utter horse shit.

ronnie oldvolks reports he just  put together a case with this same 
defect, and had to cut it 20 over.
