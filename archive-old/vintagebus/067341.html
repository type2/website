Subject: Re: [VB] re:heaters

If the heater is inside the bus you need to cut a hole for the exhaust to
exit.  The stock location for a Southwind is opposite the battery in your
aux battery location and you need to exhaust the heater out the bottom there
too.  Just cut a small exhaust hole where the heater sits and let the
exhaust tube run out it.  Again the propane exhausts lots of water vapor and
would not be good for driving as you would have to scrape the inside of the
bus as the vapor would freeze to the inside   The procat has a tank that
fits inside.   Zodi has a heater in a box that might be good for stationary
camping as it is designed for a tent but could be made to use in a bus but
you still have the water vapor problem  http://www.zodi_dot_com/hotvents.html
Here is another with a shower too  http://www.zodi_dot_com/combo.html

&gt; was writ:
&gt; &quot;Now a SouthWind or Eberspracher is putting out nice dry heat.  You split
&gt; the gas line so that you have one for the gas heater and you have to run
&gt; your exhaust out also.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; what do you mean you need to run the exhaust out also? DO you mean you
need
&gt; to exhaust the heater out of the bus? Do you put the heater in the engine
&gt; compartment, or inside the bus, and how would you exhaust from either
&gt; location?
&gt;
&gt; now back to the procat/black cat option-these things look tippy...do you
&gt; guys make some contraption to keep from tipping over? The procat looks a
&gt; little nicer designed, but the internet sites i have seen it on do not
show
&gt; a tank attached to it...
