&lt;&lt; Well, my all original EARLY '59 Westfalia (production date of 11/5/58) is 
an SO-23 kit with yellow and black wool, so that throws out the previously 
posted logic.  My understanding is that the color of the wool fabric is not 
indicative of the year, but of the exterior color of the bus.  Dove Blue bus 
= yellow/black.  Mango Green/Sea Gull Grey bus = yellow/black.  Red/White bus 
= red/black.
