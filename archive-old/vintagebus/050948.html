Subject: passenger side Cargo floor last 13 inches ??


About restoring the Cargo Floor, im in the need of the driver side cargo
floor , the last 13 inche width, but  my local part supplier said that this
part does not have the hook to hold the middle seat, so i have to buy a
complete half floor!!

Then i have few option:

-Buy a complete driver side cargo floor at  big $$$$ (most of the $$ go in
shipping)
-Buy the 13 inch panel and weld in hooks i have from the junk one
-then he said i could have a Passenger side cargo floor at good price as he
have one sent by error, so i could try to fit it on the driver side, but my
concern here are the hook fitting and the hole for the cargo door maybe its
as much trouble as welding only the hook on the 13 inch panel...

Or is there another supplier that make the last 13-15 inc WITH the hook ??
I think my local part supplier get his part from RMM !!

thx

mike
