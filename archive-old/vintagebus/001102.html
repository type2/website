I bought a Suburban brand rv heater: model # nt12f at the Lincoln NE. swap
meet today and wonder if anyone has any experince or advise in installing it
in a Splitty. I would like to use a regular &quot;barbeque grill&quot; type propaine
tank for it but i am not sure where I should mount it.  I thought the back
bumper would be nice but some of my friends thought that would be dangerous
in event of a collision.  I told them it would act like reactive armor and
blast the offending viehcle away from my splitty &lt;hehe.

But seriously, this heater is great.  It looks like a regular home furnace
(tan in color with lourved sheetmetal).  It even seems to have a standard
universal thermo coupler just like in a gas; furnace, water heater or stove.
The perfect heater for The midwest in the early spring and late fall, so, if
you have any advise please forward it.

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan
