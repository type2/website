Thanks, Stephen.  Your efforts and offers are appreciated.

I've just returned from spending a couple of hours with Daniel at the
beautiful Oval's Motorsports parking lot.  Sure not my choice of a campsite
for a week+.

On a slightly longer test drive yesterday Dan experienced overheating at the
slightest grade, and an Oval's person apparently had the same experience on
a test drive today.

The freshly built engine is now out of his bus and in the shop.  They
discovered a very narrow, incorrect, fan inside his doghouse fan housing.

They are also questioning the accuracy of the timing notch(es) on his
crankshaft pulley.  On close inspection the &quot;TDC&quot; notch they used to set up
the engine appears to be a hand-filed mark.  I assume they will verify TDC
with a degree wheel, etc., and set that right.

An Oval's person checking for air flow before the engine was dropped found
lots of air being shoved around, but no perceptible flow through the oil
cooler.  A new oil cooler is to be installed.

According to Dan the dead engine had no air flaps installed, and Oval's did
not add an air flap assembly and thermostat to the new engine.  They also
did not patch up the various holes in the engine tin, the most obvious being
the openings for the missing hoses from the fan housing to the heat
exchangers.

I'm more than a little disturbed by all this as I would have expected a shop
of Oval's reputation to deal with these issues the first time around, as the
engine was being built, assembled, and installed.  It's even more unsettling
knowing that they've fiddled around for several days without resolving the
problems, and only tonight have reluctantly pulled the engine to do a proper
diagnosis.

Dan is also concerned about what he'll ultimately be charged for all this.
Oval's earlier made it quite clear that if their &quot;warranty sticker/seal&quot;
showed overheating [it goes on the engine case and fries at 250* F.] their
warranty was voided.  The sticker fried on his first test drive of less than
10 miles.

Stay tuned...  It ain't over 'til it's over.....

&gt;&gt;  [7:00pm Friday] I called Daniel and he said Oval's is pulling the engine
now
to look at the oil cooler and trying to find the current cause.

I offered to drive him or help him in any way, he has my home number (425)
235-9168.

If Oval's made any mistakes, I expect they will correct it.  I sure hope
they stay late tonight and Saturday if needed and don't make him wait until
Monday :)
