Subject: Re: [VB] License Light Lens on '58 Decklid
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Please excuse this momentary lapse of decency and
sanity:

&gt; I have one of those one-yr-only decklids on my '58
&gt; SC.... no break light 

BRAKE BRAKE BRAKE BRAKE BRAKE!!! 

Thank you for your continued understanding of how
annoying I find the continued misuse of these
homonyms.

Sincerely,
John Cloonan

p.s. - please direct any and all flames about me being
a complete prick for correcting spelling errors in an
e-mail list to:
