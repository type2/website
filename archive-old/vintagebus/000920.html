jb,

Any good locksmith should be able to make you keys from the codes on your
handles and ignition. I found that those quickie key shops sometimes have
trouble, but a locksmith will be able to look up the codes and make you
keys.

BTW, it helps if you leave the handles with the shop (rather than just the
code), so that they can try the keys, and make any slight adjustments if
necessary.
