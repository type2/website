Grrrrreat.  Now it's going to be a bikini/NewBeetle/CalLooker/Drag Racing
event.

Suffice it to say that the two individual's interests in &quot;vintage&quot; VW's
would appear to be diametrically opposed.

Maybe it will become an American hotrod show...

For those of you who are fortunate enuf not to hail from the Sacramento
area, this is the same guy that owns &quot;Bugformance&quot; and puts on the
Sacramento Bug-O-Rama.

&gt;not the Classic. To expensive for me. The VW Classic is now produced/owned
&gt;by Bob Hole and group from Sacromento. Hope it stays as Rich made it. Will
&gt;be there as a show bus, not swapper.
