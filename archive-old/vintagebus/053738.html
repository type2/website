&gt; Are you implying that a rubber fuel line through a hole
&gt; in the tin is safe?  

Yup, it's double-walled neoprene, very stout. And you can line the hole in
the firewall, NOT the tin, with split VW fuel line if you wish to have a
gasket there. I don't bother. The hole was smoothed out, and the incoming
line has never shown any abrasion at all in 15 years, and two buses.
