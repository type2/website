Well, I had a roof rack,
with 3 kayaks on top, and
a non-VW schmuck for a driver, and
he was going over 65, and
if burning up my engine qualifies as a 
&quot;significant degradation in performance&quot;,
so much so that he couldn't see the cop's lights
trying to pull us over (too much smoke),
meanwhile he was still standing on the pedal
wondering why we weren't even going 50, then
yeah, I noticed a slight negative trend in 
performance in my former '67 Deluxe.

Moral, don't sleep, drive it yourself instead, 
or find someone with at least half a wit to drive 
while you catch some Z's on a long trip.

Jeff  busless, and frankly I don't miss that bus

Had anyone noticed a significant degradation in performance when traveling
with a roof rack?
