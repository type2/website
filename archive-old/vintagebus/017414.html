I've been getting way too much experience with these
things lately.  I've had 4 different senders in my '67
Deluxe.  The last one, purchased new at Randy's Stuff,
appears to have straight, not tapered, threads, and
came with an o-ring to seal against the block.  All
the other ones had tapered threads and would stick out
away from the block when snugged up oil-tight (and no
seal).

Now, while we're on this subject, why have I been
putting so many senders in my bus?  I just can't seem
to get the oil idiot light to work!  Every time I put
in a sender, I can turn the key, see the light, start
it up, see the light go out, just fine.  Then the
light never comes on again!  (However, I can ground
the sender wire and light the light.) After four
senders (two  of which were working in other engines)
I'm beginning to suspect that something strange is
going on. 

This motor is the original block with 1600, DP heads,
CW crank, 009, 34 PICT-3, and extractor, all done by
the PO.  I can't see any modifications to the oil
system.  Could there be some kind of one-way
(anti-drainback?) valve or something keeping pressure
in my system after the engine is stopped?  Could I
have some excessive oil pressure that consistently
blows each oil sender on one start?  I have almost no
leakage or dripping from this hard-working motor.

&gt; 
&gt; The sender has to ground through the engine
&gt; case/threads so teflon tape or
&gt; sealer is not a really good idea here. The threads
&gt; will prob cut through
&gt; the teflon enough to mnake some sort of contact but
&gt; maybe not reliable
&gt; over time.
