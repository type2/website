Actually the correct drum for your bus is 211 405 615B not C, the C drum
will fit but uses a different axle seal on the 64-67 buses, this drum (211
405 215C) is for 68-70 bay window (loaf) buses but will work. I just found
some new 211 405 215B brake drums, these are made in Brazil and are of
excellent quality, I have only 3 left as they sold out quickly.

I don't think these are listed in my on-line catalog yet.

Paul,

The correct drum for 64-67 bus is 211 405 615C

131 405 615A is for 66-67 bug.
