 So I just took a look at my door hinges, because one's getting a
 little stiff, and couldn't figure out how to properly lubricate it.
 By properly, I mean getting the oil between the horizontal friction
 surfaces.  Getting it along the shaft of the pin seems relatively
 easy.
 
 Any suggestions?  WD-40 is not the answer.
  &gt;&gt;

on the cargo doors you can remove the rubbery plastic cover from the top of 
each hinge and oil the wick.  If you don't have caps I think they are reproed 
now, they are cute and pointy where they plug up the wick ans slightly 
rounded flat on top where the send the water from going in the wick.

if you open the front doors wide and look at what opened on the hinge there 
is a little oiling notch.  

Hope this Helps

VW says oil your hinges every 1200 miles.    hahahahahahaha
