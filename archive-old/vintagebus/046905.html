&gt;  hi,
&gt;  
&gt;  i have currently purchased a 67 kombi and wanted to know what are the best 
&gt; and most feasible options for increasing the power of the existing 1300cc 
&gt; engine....by feasible, i mean without spending a ton of money....
&gt;  
&gt;  i was told to put 87mm big bore pistons in it, that they will fit....how 
&gt; much work does this entail? is it a bolt on installation or will it include 
&gt; taking it to shops and special tool purchases....?
&gt;  
&gt;  thanks
&gt;  mike


Is it really bad on power?   Do a tune up and compression check.  BTW, the 
1300 was only sold in the 1966 bug, and the engine number would start with 
the letter F.  more often you find the 1600cc motor.  do you have a copy of 
Muirs VW repair for the Compleat Idiot?  Great book.   Then again, odds are 
stacked against you having the original 1500cc motor a 67 came with when new, 
and it could be a 40hp 1200.  Engine serial numbers and what they mean are in 
the back of the idiot book   

to turn a 1300 or 40 into a 1500 I think the cylinder holes need to be bored 
larger, PITA, must be taken out, and to a machine shop.
