Subject: 1/3-2/3 seat question

Oh most knowledgable list...

I just picked up a ratty 1/3-2/3 seat and have a
question about reupholstery.  Did the back of the 2/3
portion of the seat have anything on it, except for
the top 6&quot; or so?  From what I've discovered, the back
was not covered with upholstrey of any kind, leaving
the springs exposed.  Since nobody really ever saw
this area, I would bet that is the case.

Also, are there any recommendations for restoring
frames?  Sandblast and paint?  Something more
detailed?  It looks like all the springs are in decent
shape, but the whole frame on both seats is covered in
rust.  Mostly surface rust, but rust nonetheless.

Thanks,
Paul
