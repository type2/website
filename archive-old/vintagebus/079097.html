----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; on a bone stock bus (with thermostat) how can head temps be improved?

Check your engine bay for vacuum using clear aquarium tubing and a glass of
water. Head off down the highway and see how much vacuum it's pulling.
Anything more than 1/8 to 3/16&quot; is too much IMHO. If you can get positive
pressure using scoops, you're going to be ahead of the game even more.
