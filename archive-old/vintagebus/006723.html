At the Classic a fellow came up to me that restores old trailers, the
interesting part is that he was a expert on camper (trailer) windows. Repops
seals for the non westy glass but said he has piles of windows for parts,
even the weird slot bar pop-outs that are in my DD, his web site is
www.vintage-vacations_dot_com

&lt;&lt;WooP, way ahead of you...  Found a custom glass place in the phonebook
and
just ordered new glass all the way around.  $5 a slat.  not bad..&gt;&gt;

$5 a slat??!!! Not bad???!!! What the hell do you guys do for a living??
Seems like a hell of a lot to me for a thin slab of glass.
