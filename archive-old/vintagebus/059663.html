Subject: Re: [VB] mexican vw engines

I've bought two of them so far.  The first one had hydraulic lifters.  Ran
awsome, and very quiet, only problem was, if you parked for more than two
days, the lifters lost thier prime, and would take about 5 minutes to prime
again. That was a bit annoying.

The second one I bought, for my current bus, I went with solid lifters.  I
full flowed it, set the valves, and put it in.  I've checked the valves a
few times, and they havent gone out of adjustment (sweet!), and have racked
on almost 7K miles on it.

You could build a motor cheaper using rebuilt parts, but if you were to use
all new parts, you would have a hard time beating the price.  Especially
since the labor to put the motor together is done, plus they have a
warranty.  There are several vendors that sell them, I personally went with
Aircooled.Net as they had them in stock, ready to ship.  I had it within a
week of placing my order.
