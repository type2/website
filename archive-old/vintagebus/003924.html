Just thought I'd share a little tidbit of info with y'all here. I was just
looking through all of thsi paperwork I got with my 65 and on the window
sticker it lists
&quot;W/O SUNR.&amp;SKYLIGHTWINDOWS    -160.00&quot;
Talk about getting the most for your money. I'm sure that probably equates
to $1000 or so now, but look at what these roof sections alone are going
for. Sure wish that guy who bought this would've opted for that option....
then again, I probably wouldn't have it now if he did. Take care all,
-Walt
