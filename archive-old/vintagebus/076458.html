Subject: Re: [VB] different from bentley?

&gt; missed this auction by 1 minute :P
 any major differences from the bentley? chapters deleted, 
 better/worse pics, etc? my bentley is for 68 - 72, and it is a royal 
 pain having to look at all those T4 pics  :)  ... wish i'd seen this 
 sooner.

I have that book. It is printed by VW. Just like the Bentley, but 68-70 only. 
It shows up on that auction site about once a month. The last one sold for 10.50 on 11/5:

Nice glossy paper and the wiring diagrams are in color. Very informative.
