Subject: [VB] Repairing things that should be replaced
Message-Id: &lt;199911051820.KAA29227_at_web1_dot_calweb_dot_com&gt;

I'm starting to get the feeling that people are &quot;repairing&quot; things
that should be replaced out of some sort of rebellion, just to
show how cool/smart/tough they are.  Like somehow, by spending a few
hours fixing some little part, they've cheated the system.  I can
see it if you're in BFE, and you either can't get a new widget,
or the local FLAPS wants $200 for one, and you just don't have
that kinda bread.  But otherwise, realise that your buses is getting
old, and pieces *will* need to be replaced to keep it in top
working condition.  Sure, I spend a lot of time and money repairing
my buses, but when the opportunity presents itself to replace
a part with a NEW one rather than patch together a worn-out one,
I take it.  And then it's one less thing I have to worry about
later.

Reminds of the two rednecks driving a truck and come to a bridge
with a sign &quot;No truck's over 13'&quot; - they stop, measure their truck -
13 1/2'.  One redneck says to the other, &quot;hell, there ain't no
cops around, I say we go for it!&quot;
