it's possible to remove the fan shroud without removing the engine. 
Only 2 screws hold it in place.  You just have to be patient and jack it
around until it comes out.  It also helps to remove the generator
stand.  If you still can't get it then remove the intake manifold as
well.  By the time you've done all that, it's still easier to pop the
engine out.
