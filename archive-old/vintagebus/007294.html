I just got done killing about an hour viewing one of my favourite
little-known VW classifieds sites.  The cool part is that by and large, the
people don't know what they have.  I have confirmed one person who picked up
a 1977 Green with plaid interior bus - auto with A/C, one-owner, low miles,
no rust, all records from day one including sales sticker from this site.
I've already gotten a lead on a &quot;VW Truck.&quot;  We'll see what that turns out
to be.

Anyway, go to http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/miscvwads.htm and enjoy the
U.S. promised lands of VWs!!!  The best part is that the ads are updated
once a week with regular changes!  I'm not going to divulge my source unless
someone figures it out or I find my double cab I'm looking for. :-)

Enjoy...
