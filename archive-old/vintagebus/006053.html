&gt;hey youze guys,
&gt;
&gt;I need to re-tourque the heads on a motor and I've heard different things.
One POV is the common sense one that you should do all the bolts, the other
is that it's just the ones under the rockers that loosen up.  Any documented
correct procedures out there?


The reason for just retorquing the ones under the rockers has nothing to do
with them being the only ones that loosen, it has to do with people doing it
with the motor in the car. You are not retorquing your heads by doing only
the lower four, you are tweaking your heads. Either drop the motor and do it
all the way or don't bother. BTW, I have never had to retorque a motor after
using the three torque settings and two patterns as in the Idiot Book, both
sides in sequence when building. I have pulled the motors and checked, but
never found a loose one, yet. Maybe the next time, though. All my motors
have had 8mm studs and case savers. Most common factor in loose heads that I
know of is pulled studs due to overtightening. Conversation goes something
like this...

Q: What did you torque them to?

A: I cranked them as tight as I could get them, I don't have a torque
wrench.

B: 85. I read something about 24 in the book, but Dad told me that's too
low.

C: I put the top ones where they said, but I tightened the lower ones some
more cause I don't want the pushrod tubes to leak.

D: Till they pop. That's how you know when they're just right.

The American tradition of learning the hard way is alive and well.
