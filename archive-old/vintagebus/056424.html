Subject: Re: [VB] Run the thermostat or not?

&gt; Are you sure your flap rod was bent right or routed right through the
head? You shouldn't have had to move the bracket mounting stud anywhere but
the factory placement. One bracket fits all.
&gt;
My understanding is that there are some factory brackets that are slotted to
slide up/down a small amount.
