Subject: Re: [VB] '65 tranny removal report (longish)

dave easterwood did a series of RGB articles in OBR.
Real good job with cross ref bearing numbers and everything.
I have them scanned if you want me to send them to you
I could put them on my type2_dot_com pages and link them to the library
if dave gives me permission.
