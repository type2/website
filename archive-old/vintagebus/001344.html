  I also had the same problem on my 61 Westy, all you need is a product called &quot;Fabulous Blaster&quot;. It is the BEST penetrating lubricant out there! Everyone on the list should have it, comes in a spray can. Forget WD-40, Liquid Wrench, they are as good as spraying water compared to this stuff! NAPA stores have it locally. Ask vwhoward how it works!
