sounds real clear. That's the kind of things that are useful. I noticed some
rokers out of adjustment and sounds like the carb needs some work. There was
some hesitation and popping in the revs, vac leak on carb or bad vac advance
on distributor?

For fun, I tried recording the engine on the dc today as it is brand
new to me, and I am still exploring it.  It is an h case, so I believe
it's a 1500 from around 65?  sp, new muffler, but anyway, here's a
folder where I put some sound files of it starting and running.  With a
low charge, the starter and flywheel sound terrrible.  Something aint
right there, like a 12v flywheel jammed into a 6v bellhousing maybe?
The motor sounds ok, but has a rat a tat tat when you give it gas, that
I'm not sure about.  Diagnosing engine woes is new to me, because
Although I've had buses for five years now, the only one that ever
really ran had a freshly rebuilt 1600 in it, and it always sounded
great.  Comments and feedback welcome, and I'll let you know what I
find when I take it out.
