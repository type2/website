Subject: Sorry to say...

As of this weekend I have resigned my duties of Secretary and
Newsletter Editor of the NH VW club due to new job demands...

	I will be submitting my name to LiMBO as NH chapter representative and
event co-ordinator...

	Thanks to ALL on the lists for the Newsletter fodder that I have used
over the last couple of years...

	Take Care...
