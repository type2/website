Lots of thin arms for both I am pretty sure.  The newest one is a Sachs one.

  &quot;stock&quot; is vague... does it have the circles or lots of thin arms?

  I'd think about your bowden tube.  seem to remember the bend of thebowden
tube affects the firmness of the clutch pedal.   it's in the bentley.
