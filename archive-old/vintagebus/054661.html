Subject: Re: [VB] EMPI rear stabilizer bar

How about the axle tube straps?  I've seen some NOS ones in the Empi
packaging....seems the sellers are more impressed with the stupid shrink
wrapped cardboard than the part inside.  Couldn't bring myself to pay that much
for card board!

Are repos of these made?

&gt; Hi Chris,

&gt; The donut that goes between the bar and the plate that connects to the trans
&gt; should be easy to find a replacement.  The piece that goes between the end
&gt; of the bar and the axle tube I don't thing is easily found.  Most people I
&gt; have met get a flat piece of some form of rubber and make one.  I'll try and
&gt; post a picture today or tomorrow.  I have several compensators in my garage
&gt; but only about 3 of those little pads... I believe I have a lead on someone
&gt; that can make them.

&gt;
&gt; My '67 DC has an original dealer-installed EMPI rear stabilizer bar in
&gt; need of some repair.  34 years of oil leaks have disintegrated what
&gt; appears to be a rubber piece that connected the bracket attached to the
&gt; engine to the bar attached to the axles.  Does anyone know if a suitable
&gt; replacement part is available?  Or have one for sale?
