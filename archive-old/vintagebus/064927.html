Subject: Listees in Denver/Golden area?

I'm going to Golden Colorado for work November 11-16 and I'd like meet some Bus people while I'm there if anyone is interested. Maybe have dinner or something (even cooler if I get to ride in a bus too) I don't think I have to do any work until the 12th so I'd have all day Monday (11th) to fart around.



Thanks,

Brian
