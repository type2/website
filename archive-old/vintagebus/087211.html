Glacier is beautiful.

Greg and I bought our '56 Westy from a guy in Kalispell.?? He used to live near Glacier on his granparents homestead, up near the Candian border.?? He lived up there in the 70s, and logged with horses.
He wore the hell out of the '56.?? It has a Eberspacher heater, which is why he kept driving it so long, it had good heat

He'd drive into town every weekend to go to church and do laundry.??
 70 miles of unpaved roads
gravel
ungraded gravel.

The steering in that bus was so horrible that one of the trailing arms had worn through the bakelite bushing and startied wearing into the metal of the beam.?? EVERYTHING? in the steering got replaced, except the actual beam.??
 tierods, drag link, spindles, junk.
the steering box, junk
upper leafs, 4 broken... lower leaves, 5 broken
trailing arms very worn
swinglever pin?could do the salsa, it had a helluva wiggle

I want to go back to Montana with the bus and show it to them, now it is running and all.
Montana is beautiful.

From: C. Dreike,
Sorry about the slow reply, been on vacation to the Glacier National Park. Didn't see a single split. Saw about 3 bays and about 3 eurovans. Two were set up as campers. One with a pop top.?
