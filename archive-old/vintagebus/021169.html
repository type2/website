Subject: Re: [VB] Westy Flip Seat wanted/Questions


I'm looking for one of the early
&gt; Westfalia front seats that
&gt; flips around so it can face the rear of the vehicle.
&gt; I know they were
&gt; used in 1962, but not sure of other years. 

Richard, I have an extra couple of the seat
braces/flipper mechanisms, but they're not perfect. 
One has a loose locking deal on one end, and one is
missing the lock on the bottom, but is usable in the
fore or aft positions, but is shaky when in the
centered position.  If no one else responds, let me
know.

Anyone
&gt; know of any other
&gt; reinforcement? I can't seem to see any. 

I haven't seen any other reinforcement on a flipseat
except for the plate under the table hole
