I got my catalog that I ordered in the mail the other day. They sure are 
fast. After reading the whole thing, I know why almost everybody with a VW 
has used it. He ordered the pan resto kit for $120. Now to my question. The 
catalog has a steering wheel restoration kit. Has anybody tried this? The 
steering wheel has no missing pieces, but A LOT of cracks. It costs $60. Is 
it worth a shot, or would it be better to pay to have it restored. It is the 
original steering wheel, so he doesn't want to replace it, but doesn't have 
money right now to have it restored.

On a sidenote, so I don't have to make another post. I will be going to 
Pomona again this Sunday, the 5th. The last one was great, even if some of 
you did not like it. One guy had a very complete '66 westy that he was 
selling for $4000 obo. Man I wish I had the money. I drooled over it for a 
while, then got pulled away by my cousin who got tired of waiting for me to 
move on.
