Subject: RE: [VB] Stupid Friday Question

Was the oldest a 65 up?type 3, and the wide fivers a year or two newer
buses(I hope)



&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Before my most recent purchase I had three Aircooled VW's.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Of those three, the two newest ones had the wide five lug
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pattern, and the oldest had the small 4-lug type.
