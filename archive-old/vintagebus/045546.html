**This will be my first, last, and only reply**

I have tried not to air my dirty laundry or any personal negative comments of 
any kind on the list, I don't feel that is the place for it.  But since my 
name has been very publicly brought up I feel the need to explain at least 
the highlights of my side of the story.  I have had lots of dealing with 
folks on the list and 99.9% have gone on without a hitch.  To the best of my 
recollection there have only been two deals gone sour - Both of these folks 
have decided to use this public forum to deal with a private matter.

First Greg at vintage warehouse,

Without going into all the little details Greg had two sets of low hinge 
panel doors advertised on his website which I desperately needed for my '67 
Double door panel.  The price was $15 each which was *fantastic* if they were 
in the condition advertised.  Some folks idea of &quot;Good condition&quot; varies from 
mine (I think we have all been there before) so since I had never dealt with 
Greg I wanted to see a picture before sending the money.  I told him I would 
take them, both sets, as long as they were as described.  He says fine.  Lots 
of time passes and no picture.  I email an inquiry and he tells me how busy 
he is, which I understand, so through a friend in CA I find someone 5 minutes 
from him to go look at them, buy them (cash), and ship them to me.  For the 
next three weeks Greg is unable to meet up with someone - with cash, ready to 
buy - who lives five minutes away.  

Then, several months later when I post a for sale item he needs (blue mats), 
he emails me looking to buy.  Sorry, just doesn't work that way back here in 
the Midwest.  If you can't help me when I need something, don't ask me to go 
out of my way for you, I'm busy.

Regarding Kabayo, 

I **LOVE** to help out list members!!  I will gladly pull any part off of any 
of my parts busses, no matter how small, and send it to anyone.  HOWEVER, 1) 
You are going to have to tell me what it is in a way I can understand so I 
know what to pull and, 2) If it is a small part ($10 or less) you are either 
going to have to convince me it is an emergency, or wait until I get around 
to it.  I may be unemployed but my time is worth something.  If I spend 3 
hours messing with a $10 part I have made a whopping $3.33 an hour *MINUS* 
what I had in the part to begin with.  This is even less than minimum wage.  
If you don't want to pay more than $3 an hour for my time and/or you don't 
want wait for me to get to it, then hop in your bus, find a salvage yard (if 
there is one around with busses), find the right year bus (if you can), pull 
the part (if it is good), take it back home, and clean it up yourself.  
***I-have-other-things-to-do-besides-pull-your-part-for-$3-an-hour***


Finally, for those still reading, if you check my Ebay profile you will find 
I am honest, describe things accurately, and ship quickly.  If you read the 
posts to the list regarding me, my character, the quality my shifter 
extensions, etc. you will find the overwhelming majority of people I have 
dealt with are extremely satisfied.  If you are still uneasy about dealing 
with me, Pmail someone who has dealt with me in the past and ask how their 
experience was.  If you are still uneasy, then don't buy from me.
