&gt; I have heard that the cargo floor peices that DBH sells do NOT have the
&gt; reinforced strike plate for the cargo door vertical rods nor other seat
&gt; mounting plates.  I have heard that WW's floors do have these plates.  Is this
&gt; correct?  I got this info from another lister (chunks!), and just want to see
&gt; if things have changed :)


You have to install your own seat mounting plates, either getting
new ones or salvage the old ones.  The striker plate is
available, but doesn't come on the floor piece itself.  I don't know
if WW's has them or not.
