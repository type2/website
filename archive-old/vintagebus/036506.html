&lt;&lt; Hey List
 
 So I have a BN2 - I KNOW IT IS A BEETLE HEATER - does anyone know of any
 wiring diagrams on the web?  How close are these to ye ol' BN4?  I can find
 a fair (fare?) amount of BN4 info but almost no BN2 info - guess I ought to
 look around the beetle cites (sites?) (this spelling is tough).

Seeing as this cold weather is making me yearning for the instant heat and I 
have been tinkering with a semi functioning 12V BN-4 (which may be 'early' or 
'late'), I feel your pain.   I have looked at a bunch of gas heater infos, 
and remember seeing some BN-2 stuff.  It seems mostly cryptic to me.  such as 
people asking me whether mine is' early' (through 71?) or late (72 and 
later?)  without me having any idea of what the difference is.  Probably 
early, a wild guess, based on the 2 rather than three wires to the gas pump.  
  anyway, have fun searching these sites (meaning places, while sights are 
thing you see, citing is when you write what written material you are 
quoting)   Give it a fair try , I hope you fare well with it.  It's a list I 
got from Rick Taylor:
