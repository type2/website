Subject: full width front bench seat mounting ?????
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Trying to put an original front seat back in a 63.....

It had a Toyota seat or something like that so there are no brackets etc

I have brackets to weld in but am not sure if the seat back just hangs from 
the brackets or if there is something else missing......

its a full width bench seat with the hump in it

I have seen earlier buses that had a 90 degree sheet metal bracket mounted to 
the body at the lower edge of the seat back, I am not sure if all the full 
benches were that way.........
