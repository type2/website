Thom;
I clean mine with mild (Arm &amp; Hammer) laundry detergent, warm water and a
brush.
You can use Shout on the tough spots, but hand washing and THOROUGH drying
has worked for me, my tent has come clean and the color hasn't been affected
with this
method. Another note, I had my tent up a couple of weeks ago and got caught
in the rain.
Here in the midwest it's not practical to hope the sun will dry it out. I
called a friend with a large garage and set the tent up. Inside the tent I
placed two small ceramic heaters and let them run for about
5 hours, the entire tent was dry especially around the seams and doubled
over areas that are susceptible for mildew. What ever you do make sure it's
dry when you pack it away.
John
