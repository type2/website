Subject: Loose wheel

Hi,

And all these years I blamed one of my friends for not tightening one of 
my wheels all the way before a road trip. Ugh. I'll have to look that 
guy up and tell him it wasn't his fault. But I will blame him for 
forgetting to put the lug wrench back in the van after he was done (and 
us getting stranded with a loose wheel).

My mom was a chemical engineer. She worked with oil tools products 
towards the end of her career. In the oil field they had similar 
problems and used Lok-Tite or other thread-locking adhesive.

Maybe a &quot;nylock&quot; version of the wheel lug bolt? Or a slightly longer 
bolt even.

But what the heck, why have 5 bolts if one gets loose and your wheel 
falls off?

OK, I know, weld the wheel, bolts and drum together. There, problem 
solved.

And yes, it is Friday.

Conrad
