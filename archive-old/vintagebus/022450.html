Subject: Tent Mystery - what do I have?
Mime-Version: 1.0


Ok, I got a tent for the '55.

I can't figure it out.

It has 3 pieces of red &amp; white tent-material and a jumble of poles.

Piece 1:  about 4' wide and almost 7' long, with frills.

Piece 2: about 5' wide and almost 8' long

Piece 3: identical to piece 1

From assembling it on the living room floor, piece #1 makes the roof and
the other two make the sides, which  fold around to make an opening in the
front.

The places where the poles mount to the top is not the same as the mounts
on my bus, and I *just* had some of those and sent them to M Heron!  Damn!
My camper has the short and tall mounts on either end of the bus.

This tent is a little wider than the cargo door opening.

Anyone know what this tent is?

It looks kinda like the foyer tent on Joe Clark's page.
