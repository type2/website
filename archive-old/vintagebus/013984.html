On my '66, that's the wiper switch.  Hard to tell in the picture if it
is a toggle or a twist type.  Toggle's non-standard.  Should be a
twister, going clockwise for on and more on.

Rear compartment courtesy/work light.

Headlights.  Pull on.  Twist for dash brightness.

Emergency flashers.  Pull on.

Yes.  There's a hold screw that goes in from the bottom, through the
horizontal plate that's hidden by the plate with the padding on it.

:  a cover for under the front (this bus has one, but it is in *sad* shape!)

Often referred to as a belly pan or nose pan.  As far as I can tell,
these are pretty much interchangeable for all of the '60s.  While
you're down there, check to see how many screws managed to rust into
the captive nuts and shear off.  I haven't quite gotten to the point
of drilling mine out, but since there are only two and half useable
ones left, it's rapidly becoming a priority....

:  a cover for the windshield washer bottle.  The rubber on mine is *toast*!

Good luck.  I believe RMMW carries this for bay windows, but not for
the splits.  I'd love to be proven wrong.
