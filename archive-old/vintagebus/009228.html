Subject: [VB] Throttle wire adjustment procedure  [Was:Sticking Throttle Lever on 34 Pict]
Date: Thu, 27 Apr 2000 01:08:06 -0700

[...]

Put a brick on the accelerator pedal to hold it all the way down/open.

Loosen the clamp at the carb throttle arm that holds the throttle wire.

Hold the throttle arm on the carb wide open, against the stop, with your
right hand while also pulling the wire tight with that hand.

Tighten the clamp/barrel nut with your left hand [and appropriate tool].

Take the brick off the gas pedal and move the pedal through it's range a
couple of times, then replace the brick.

Go back and check the clearance between the throttle arm and the stop on the
carb.

It's nearly impossible to do this procedure single-handed and wind up with
the adjustment too tight.  Because of the cumulative clearances, etc., you
_will_ have at least 1/16&quot; gap at the throttle arm stop with the gas pedal
fully depressed.

Bottom line:    You want the throttle to open as much as possible for
maximum &quot;performance&quot;.  You do not want the throttle wire to be stretched
tight because the carb throttle arm is against the stop and the gas pedal
isn't quite all the way down.  That is guaranteed to break the throttle wire
in short order, and it doesn't do the carb much good, either.

All too many VW &quot;professionals&quot; screw up this adjustment, either setting the
wire too tight or setting it so loosely that the carb cannot achieve wide
open throttle.

&gt;&gt;  The process I did was to pull the cable tight and screwed it down. Was
this incorrect?  &lt;&lt;
