&lt;&lt;as i brought up about a year ago, my 57 single cab doesnt even have the hole

on the speedo pod for a switch or a plug.... what about yours kyle -does

your 57 have a hole for a plug? Im still wondering if its an early truck

thing.  If not, that would make my speedo pod ROTR or just a factory error

:) .....        Everett? frankie? list? how was/is yours?
