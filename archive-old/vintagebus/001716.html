I don't think my carb is getting gas from the fuel pump. I took off the air
cleaner, looked down into the throat, worked the linkage, and it seems as
though I'm getting nothing. I have set the timing (I think), put plugs,
points, condenser, and it still doesn't start. Before I changed the timing
and it would start, someone suggested it may have been a vaccuum leak, as
when I started it it would rev up high for a second and then go back down,
no matter what I did witht he accelerator pedal. Taking the carb off is
going to be a tough one, the back two bolts are hidden behind the linkage on
one side and part of the choke on the other, should be interresting seeing
how to get them off. Should the carb be taken off and rebuilt, or is
something just loose, needing to be tightened? Thanks for any help.
Brad
