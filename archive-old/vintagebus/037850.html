 &lt;&lt; thought i'd post a quick note... most folks have let the &quot;12v -  started
in
  66&quot;  line pass w/o comment. the 65 s/c i have (born week of may 5, 65 (same
  as me :)!  )  is a factory 12v, mcode, sticker on the dash and all.
  which makes it cooler, but makes me dread the day the wipers cease to work!
&gt;&gt;
 
 Stephen started a great thread here. Some of the discussion has really been
food for thought. IMHO your vehicle was custom ordered from the factory with a
twelve volt OPTION. This was available as an option for transporters prior to
the 1966 model when it became standard. I am not sure but I believe that a
number of pre-66 vehicles that were fitted as emergency vehicles were probably
ordered with this option.  Clara seems to be good at this stuff, Do you agree?
