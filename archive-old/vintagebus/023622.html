 Before I got my bus back on the road, I had to undue the wing nut that 
 holds the clutch cable. I cleaned everything up so I could adjust by hand 
 and then put it back on. Since then the play in the pedal has slowly got 
 worse. Then today something happened and the play in the pedal drastically 
 changed making it barely drivable. I'm at work now. I adjusted the pedal to 
 get the play out. Only thing is now the clutch cable/pedal seems real 
 squeeky and noisy. And going into first SEEMS kinda loud and growly. My 
 idle is way too high right now, but it was that way before and I don't 
 remember that much noise.
 
 Any ideas on any of this?
 
 Regardless I'll probably order a new clutch cable first thing tommarrow.  &gt;&gt;


when a clutch cable breaks,  it tends to be that some of the strands break, 
and the cable seems to stretch out, so you have to adjust it.  You could 
probably find underneath with a flashlight where it is unravelling.  If you 
dont want to drive w/o a clutch maybe you can bum rides for a few days.   No 
it is not a weird cable.   

211 721 335 B   Cable - clutch (length 3116mm) (LHD) 
up to chassis no 469 505 and from chassis no 835 705

211 721 335C Cable - clutch (length 3110mm) (LHD)  
from chassis no 469 506 up tp 835 704

I think you can use whichever of these, 6mm is not that different.  If you 
had a RHD barndoor, those take a 3200mm clutch cable, so you have to use a 
longer one.

Ya- get a new clutch cable.  It;s a good idea to carry a spare.    I have had 
clutch and accelerator and brake cables go, which is a PITA,   So I started 
carrying spare clutch and gas and even sometimes brake cables, and that has 
kept me free from  a single cable breaking in about 6 years.  grease the new 
one when installing.  

therrre could also be a problem with the TO bearing assembly, but if that arm 
breaks, the pedal would suddenly go flat, no clutch action.
