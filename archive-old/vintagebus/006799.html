Overheating has never been easy for me to solve, there can be a lot of
causes.  I do major changes like swap out spare carb (or one of a known
non-overheating engine)... same with a good running distributor.

I try to focus on one KEY branch:

  -- is it producing TOO MUCH HEAT -- intake mixture, timing (including
dwell), etc, etc.
  -- Is it just not getting enough cooling

The list always seems to focus on cooling, but I don't -- there are a lot of
buggies and stuff out there with minimal cooling tin -- and they don't
overheat.  My observations in Arizona confirmed a lot of this.

If you are heating up that fast, if it is cooling -- it is something major
-- like the oil cooler not working -- or oil pressure relief or major tin or
fan problems.

Is it a new cooler?  Are you willing to re-do the gaskets and stuff under
the oil cooler just to make sure they seated correctly?

Then focus on the &quot;producing too much heat&quot; -- head leaks, manifold leaks,
carb leaks -- timing, improper advancing of dizzy (check with strobe), dwell
off (too short or too long), spark plugs messed-up (even fouled).  Area all
4 firing equal?  Triple-check the valves, make sure you distributor isn't
installed wrong, exhaust is right for carb -- etc, etc.

It isn't easy, the list of things to eliminate is at least 3x longer than
what I just posted!

Good luck.  Tell us what you have for a carb, manifold, dizzy, oil cooler,
whatever you can.  I'll say that being able to run the engine on a bench can
save a hell of a lot of time; too bad I never have that option!  Is there
someone who can get you a bench with starter on it?  That way you can play
with all the intake, valves, timing, etc and carb a heck of a lot easier.

well i ended up pulling the motor out twice.  First time I saw no results 
after cleaning everything up, checking everything I could think of and 
repairing and replacing some missing tin.  Second time I continued on the 
things I forgot the first time. Doh!  Anyways, I checked the heads for any 
leaks, checked valvetrain, checked oil cooler for any dirt or grime as well 
as checking to be sure that rubber o rings didnt collapse inside it and
cause 
an oil flow restriction.  Checked the mixture at the carb, which seemed 
rather lean.  Fattened it up.  Timing is fine.  Valves are at .005.  the 
engine turns nice and smooth and it doesn't seem that there are any bearings

snagging or any of that.  Checked all gaskets and seals.  Replaced seals for

intake.  cleaned fan shroud.  And now with all this done I got word that 
maybe the oil pressure relief valve was stuck, restricting the oil flow.  
Removed inspected and all is fine there.  I originally thought that oil flow

was the problem but oil pressure is just fine.  Now I stuck here completely 
stumped and really not wanting to have to tear down the motor completely.
My 
worst fear here is that I possibly spun a bearing but I do not know how to 
find this out.  The oil didnt have any significant particles in it.

  After about 10 minutes the engine heats up to the point where touching the

dipstick for a second will burn your fingers.  Also have that nice cooking 
engine smell too.  So does anyone have any ideas?  Im getting desperate
here.

The engine is a stock 1600sp with non doghouse oil cooler, single relief
case 
sporting all new jugs, heads, etc..
