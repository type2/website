Kymco sells a thing just for that.  Saw in the latest Hot VW  in their
ad.
This is for the rear, mind you.  it bolts to the Horns.

I bet you could do the same thing or something very similar

OR

Ask Thom, 

He made a cart that held Jackstands, pretty cool.,  Tranny Out and still
a &quot;rolling&quot; chassis.

GOOD LUCK,

-Roger


&gt; Hey, anybody know how make some sort of contraption so you can rip the
&gt; suspension out or your bus and still be able to move it around?
