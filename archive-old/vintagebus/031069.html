After I bought my 62 last summer, I drove it to about mid september, 
from early june.  I drove it home (the first bus I've been able to do 
that with after i bought it!!) and didn't touch a thing except install a 
new flywheel 0-ring. I drove it about 15,000 miles last year including 
the trip to BNNTA. It was a 30PICT1 carb, 1600 SP, and early 009 
distributor.  I still haven't touched the timing.  Anyways, it ran 
wonderful and got up to 28mpg with as low as 20mpg.  I don't know how it 
did it, but it did.  I would say it averaged about 24 or so.
Over the winter I took it apart as I thought something horrible went 
wrong with it, but it turned out it was just a washer in the #1 
cylinder.  Must have gotten in there when i was doing PR tube seals :( 
That was the same day Rex's engine went too if I remember correctly. 
Anyways, over the winter I honed the cyls, installed new rings, cleaned 
up the tops of the pistons, new dual port heads, new thermostat/flaps 
installed, new upper center case studs (for the heads), converted to 
doghouse oil cooler, fuel injected beetle doghouse fan shroud (with 
velocity ring), 6V 200mm flywheel, dual Weber 34ICH carbs, header w/ 
single quiet pack, and new paint even.  It looks sharp.  I still need 
the &quot;snout&quot; for the doghouse, the piece that exits the front (FIF) tin. 
  Anyone have one?!  I can NOT find one around here!  And I've looked, 
hard.  The engine is in my basement now, but will hopefully go in this 
weekend or next depending on how much time I have.  I'm just trying it 
out, if I don't like it, its going back to single carb, single port, and 
stock exhaust.  We'll see how it goes.

&gt; ps. After years of using premium fuel on my, Prescott trip I used regular
&gt; and didn't notice any difference in fuel economy and/or power. I knew I
