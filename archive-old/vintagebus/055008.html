&gt; I recently found I needed to rebuild my generator... symptoms were a slight

&gt; Discovered that if you go off-roading in the Navajo Sandstone Formation
&gt; (goes from Texas to California... Panhandle, Four Corners,  Grand Canyon,
&gt; Zion, etc), you need to tear down and clean ALL the motor! In addition to a
&gt; nice deposit of red sand dumped on the cylinder fins, the bus generator was
&gt; STUFFED with thick red dirt and grease - no wonder it was hard for the belt
&gt; to turn.  When I got the thing apart, in fact, the rear bearing was
&gt; actually discolored due to the heat caused by the resistance to the
&gt; armature turning.

How are your engine compartment seals?  ONe cause of major dust intrusion
like this is big air leaks around the engine bay.  I found this out when I
took my just-cleaned '71 on a long dirt road trip.  It was evident from
the dirt pattern that most of the dirt came in via the hole in my battery
tray.
