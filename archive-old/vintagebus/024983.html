Hey Everybody,
This is Part 2 of my trip route plan.  This will be the return
trip from Knoxville to Vancouver, BC.  This time, I'll be driving
my '66 Westy, with only my dog as a companion.  Would love to
hook up with any listees along the way, and especially any
shows/campouts/other events.

So, I'll be leaving Knoxville, with the new bus and the old dog,
whenever I decide the bus is roadworthy enough.  Probably around
May 10-15th.  I'm trying to stay off the big highways and take
the scenic routes:

Leaving Knoxville, heading thru Nashville, then Memphis before
crossing into

Arkansas.  In Arkansas I'll head up toward Ozark National Park,
then through Fayeteville and into

Oklahoma, where I'll take hwy 412, then 66 and cross into Kansas
at Chetopa.

I'm going to take some backroad highways through Kansas, passing
Manhattan, then Marysville on my way to

Nebraska.  Passing through Beatrice and Grand Island, I'll then
take Hwy. 2 across to Alliance to check out
Carhenge (hey, I might as well;-)

&gt;&gt;From there, up into South Dakota near Chadron.  In S. Dakota I'll
be taking the 385 and 85, passing through Hot Springs, Belle
Fourche, then along past Buffalo and into...

North Dakota.  Following hwy 85, I'll hit Dickinson, Watford City
and Williston before entering

Montana, where I;ll follow hwy 2 all the way to Glacier National
Park.  I hope to rejoin my friends in the big red school bus at
this point.

&gt;&gt;From here it's jus a short hop into Idaho and straight across the
border into BC- Home, sweet home, almost.  From there it's hwy 3
all the way to Vancouver.

Happy bussin, folks
Diana
