 don't know about das Kool Bullis but they do a show every year in Tampa.  
 However I think that they are based out of the Gainesville/Ocala area.
  &gt;&gt;

Das Kool Bullis is based out of Pinellas county. They do the best bus show in 
the whole world in November. And they also have a campout scheduled in the 
near future, but the date is up in the air because of NASA. They also get 
together EVERY week. For more info look at the Neato website.
