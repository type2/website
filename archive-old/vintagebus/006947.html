  I just found my thread chaser that I bought last year at the SEMA show.
The reason I mention this is because it is a very unique tool. The way it
works is like a tubeing cutter, except it has  2 blades that that cut into
the threads the same way a pipe cutters wheel would. It is adjustable from 6
mm to 19 mm and would work on both left and right hand threads. It is made
by a company called &lt;Nes1 retread&gt;, their is no country, state or city
anywhere on the packageing or tool itself. If anyone is interested in
purchaseing one or useing mine ( a refundable deposit required ) let me
know. If I recall the tool cost around 50 or so dollars. The SEMA show is in
a few weeks and I will be there again talking to all the tire manufacturers
looking for those 185/15 6 plys again and to a lot of the importers and
manufacturers of the parts we all use. For those that wonder SEMA is the
largest automotive suppliers trade show in the world, it takes a full 3-4
days to go through it and thats if you don't have meetings with suppliers or
stop at every booth.(over 3000).
