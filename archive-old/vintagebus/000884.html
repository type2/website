Hi all,

Is anyone going to Woodstock 99? My son and I are leaving Monday, the 19th
out of Crystal lake, IL (50 miles NW of Chicago). If anyone wants to caravan
just drop me a line to my P-mail.

I do wish the bands from the original woodstock were playing :) . My son
knows all the bands except for Willie Nelson.
