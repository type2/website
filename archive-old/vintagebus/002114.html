Sorry if I got any hopes up.  I assumed the bus was a double cab when in
fact, it doesn't say.  It's probably only a single cab however, at $1200 for
one with a low miles engine, it's still a good deal.  I just get hyped up
and know that someone out there on the list could enjoy it and want to get
it out there as fast as possible.   I hope someone from the list finds it to
be a good deal for them whatever it is.
