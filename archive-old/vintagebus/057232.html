Subject: byob/red barn &amp; kelley park (long)

welp volks.  since it's been kind of quiet i think i'll post a trip report... though red barn and kelley park are not far from home and don't constitute much of a trip.

i had to work friday, which kind of sucked, but i left work early, picked up the single cab and headed off to red barn.  there were about 15 buses there when we arrived.  i proceeded to socialize and had an excellent evening swapping stories, eating food and imbibing good beer and better wine.

the next day i cruised the swaps but mostly looked at the buses and socialized some more.  my mom arrived about 10 and we walked around together looking at buses.  she calls my single cab &quot;zeb&quot; because of the &quot;z&quot; in its license plate.  she kept saying, &quot;oh there's a zeb&quot; and &quot;there's another zeb but different&quot; meaning a double cab.  she made the common(?) mistake of referring to cargo doors as barndoors so at a convenient barndoor, i pointed out the pertinent part and how it changed with the later years.

while looking at the various zebs i also pointed out to her the different style bumpers from ribbed, slash and american style with over-riders.  since zeb has a ribbed bumper, she started talking trash about the buses without ribbed bumpers.  i had to laugh; she's pretty gutsy.

later in the afternoon my truck was test-fitted for a tilt that tom buese's is making.  this is the first single cab tilt he has made so after the test fit on my truck he should be able to go into production with them.  he is in full production mode with double cab tilts now.  the test tilt sure looked great on my truck; i was sorry that it was only a prototype model!

the next day jon and i rode to kelley park with our friend bill in his non-volkswagen.  we parked a few blocks away and walked into the park a little after 8.  i remarked that the line to get in wasn't too long and jon pointed out that the line extended into the next block and beyond.  &quot;oh,&quot; was all i could say.

bill and i lost jon in the rush to get at the swaps.  bill and i had scanned through part of the swaps and were heading back for a second, more detailed look when a huge truck loaded with parts pulled up.  i remarked that on the pile, peaking out from under the tarp there was what looked like a ribbed truck (rear) bumper.  bill asked the cost, $500 was the answer.  he haggled the price but the guy would only go down to $450.  i thought that sounded fair for a nice bumper with splash pans and brackets and started digging out my cash.

the tarp covering the mound of parts was tossed back bit more revealing an early and original westy rack.  bill enquired as to its price and was told that it was $400 but we could have both rack and bumper for $800.  with a look all was communicated and bill and i have decided that we cannot shop together anymore!  however we were lit up like candy-eating children for the rest of the day!

i think this is my single best parts score in my life, i never need another score like this to feel fulfilled.  i did buy some other things but the only parts that i remember is that i bought two of those 70s era accelerator pedals that are shaped like a bare foot; one dollar each.  one of them i will use and one is for jon who already has a foot-shaped dimmer switch.

after spending almost all of my money with one pass, i mostly just looked through the swaps, show and socialized some more.  i was very happy to see a nice representation from the newly formed monterey volkswagen club &lt;http://www.geocities_dot_com/mpasvwclub/&gt; at the show.  i never knew that there were so many volkswagen-lovers in our little town and now that we have a club and know one another's cars and faces, it seems like there are a lot of new friends from home.

cheers,
Rachel, Monterey CA			http://www.stanford_dot_edu/~rahaha/pig.html
