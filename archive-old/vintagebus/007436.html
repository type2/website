Subject: Pulling the Generator without dropping the engine
Date: Sun, 30 Jan 2000 22:17:39 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

...The subject pretty much sez it all.

Is there any way I can pull the generator assembly without dropping the
engine?  I am to the point where I can not get the generator/plate/squirrel
cage out without running into the intake manifold.  I have raised the shroud
as high as it will go (only about 2inches belore I hit the top of the engine
compartment).

I think I am sc*ewed, but I thought I would try asking the seasoned pros out
there before I summons the neighborhood kids to help.
