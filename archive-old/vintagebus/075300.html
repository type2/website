Subject: Re: [VB] welding prep advice

&gt;&gt; I will be using 1/2&quot; EMT. it grinds
easy, bends easy, and (as I found out 
last night) actually welds pretty darn 
decent.&lt;&lt;

Since that material is galvanized coated,
be sure to wear a supplied air respirator
or other way to prevent breathing zinc 
laden fumes you get from heating the 
metal to welding temperatures.

Sanding off the zinc is one way, but that
is only practical on the outside surfaces.
The zinc also is a contaminate for welds,
and it can goof with them as well.

The down side of soft material is that it
is, well, soft (duh) and can easily bend
under load. I think you'd be better off
finding a non-coated material that would
be stronger as well. The welding supply
places should know who has tubing stock.

As with many things in life, harder is better.

Jeff - used to hang with a bunch of welders.
