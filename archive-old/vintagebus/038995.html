Subject: E-brake removal

Anyone have a good way to remove the e-brake lever? I took the cables off
and the button and spring out. But how do I actually remove the whole
assembly? I tried getting the large pin out from underneath, I took the two
little fasteners off, but I'm not sure how to get the large pin out. Since
the heater channel is in the way and the steering link rod is kind of in the
way, how do I get at it???
