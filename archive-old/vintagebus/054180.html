Subject: More Drivers Training Fun

Theresa, my 16yo daughter has been regularly driving my '60 DC, and has
stepped it up over the last month.  Been watching her skills increase on
a daily basis, no more wishing for the nonexistent passenger side grab
handle.  :-)

One result of all the &quot;truck driving&quot; is that when she gets into my
wife's bmw, she becomes SuperDriver.

Today, we finally got her '71 SB together, carb tuned and brake lights
working.  We jumped in and went for a spin w/me driving just to make
sure all systems were go after our extensive list of work over the last
few weeks.  Steering checked out fine, brakes great, suspension hmmm...,
then tried it on the hwy and these things, get up and go!  We pulled
over and she spend the next couple of hours driving her car around for
the first time.  Of course she had to drop by some of her friends
places, then finally home.

Next friday, she has an appointment for her driver's test.  I guess I
feel fairly safe with her driving after having all those hours behind
the double cab.  Learn in something hard, then the rest is a piece of
cake?

Scott
'60 DC
