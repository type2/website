all right VERY funny.After I asked what size socket I needed to remove my
steering wheel someone ran out and bought ALL the 15/16 sockets from the
auto zone by my house! Thousands of other sockets except for that
particular one I needed  were sitting on the shelves.... or maybe everyone
decided now was the time to replace their old crusty wheel? :)  whata
coincidence -wade-
