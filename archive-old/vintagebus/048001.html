&lt;&lt;  think Paul was pointing out the needless destruction of parts the
 previous customer didn't need, which were damaged when the hamfisted
 customer just ripped everything out of the way to get at the part he
 needed.  Throwing stuff on the ground, leaving doors and windows open to
 admit the elements, stepping on stuff others threw on the ground, etc.

In the one junk yard I found a fairly complete split in, one of the 
---employee's--- had busted many of the windows out, and was working on the 
rest when he wasnt doing  doughnuts in an beat toyota at a high rate of 
speed( a wopping 30 or 40 feet away). I mentioned that the glass he was 
shattering was pretty hard to come by(15 window all sigla) and he mumbles 
something about he has permission, and crusher pile anyway. On the plus side, 
they let me pull all I could from it for $20.
