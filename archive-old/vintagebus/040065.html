&gt;I'm gonna have to replace the non adjustable tierod on my bus soon and
&gt;noticed that you can get an adjustable tire rod for the passenger side as
&gt;well.  This would seem advantagous, I think the adjustable one is even
&gt;cheaper via busboys.  Any reason why I should not go adjustable on both
&gt;sides?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;

Hi. I did this. I replaced the nonadjustable for adjustable. Is there a big 
difference in how it handles? Nope.
BUT
My alignment guy liked it alot. He showed me that the steering wheel is now 
set using the tie rods rather then the drag link. It saved him time, and 
might save you money.
And as long as that rod doesnt get bent, when you find a worn tie rod end, 
you replace it, rather then replace the whole assemby.
