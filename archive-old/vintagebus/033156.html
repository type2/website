&lt;&lt; ok i just picked up two blocks at a swap
 and an trying to look up the codes and am getting confused
 
 heres how it goes #1   AH 215177
 normally this AH would be 72 up 1600 but it only has 6 digit i assume the 
7th could be a 0 and vw just omitted it.
 
 #2   B  5007834
 
 it could be a 70 but they start at 6000some thing
 or is it a 68 with a B code
 or is it a 61 and the B is just screwwing me up?
        dont you just hate it when the #s dont match up, if anybody could 
help i would be grateful.
 
 thanks again
 Jose &gt;&gt;
added info the # 1 is dual port 1600 with the small studs w/steel inserts
 
just reposting this, as noone comented on it ,maybe you were all off in VW 
NIRVANA
HE HE HE   wish i coulda made it.8)
