&lt;&lt; Because I've always just camped in the field in between instead, and I'm 
wondering what is the point of paying for a campground with no washrooms?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Diana,
We agree it is silly to pay for a camp spot with no supplied washrooms if you 
do not have a large RV with it's own bathroom.  The Wetwesties are camping in 
the camp ground area and are arranging to rent a porta privie and are taking 
up a collection to pay for it.  How many of the vintagebus list members are 
plotting on camping out?  Even if you plan on camping outside the camping 
ground it would be a good idea to know so how many volks are going to use the 
porta privie.  Right now the Wetwesties think about 40 of thier members are 
going so the $80.00 for the prota privie comes out to $5.00 each.  The more 
volks the less the cost per person.  On the other hand too many volks and 
there is going to be a very long line at the wrong time.  So if the number of 
volks is expected to be high maybe a second porta privie can be arranged if 
you all out there speak up soonest.   Eric&amp;Barb
