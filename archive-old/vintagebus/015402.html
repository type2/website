Hello all,
  I recently got a 67 Bus redux box trans in a
trade from Steve H, but have now decided that I
no longer have a use for it. I just don't have
the time or the money for the project. So it is
up for trade/sale. I paid no money, I traded some
other parts for it. I will do the same to pass it
on to someone else. I know this is no a type 3
part, but I was going to put it in a type 3 to
make a wicked baja, someone else may want to. It
is a 67 so it has the higher gearing than the
earlier ones. I am not looking for anything
speical in trade, just old VW stuff, Baywindow
bus, pre 67 Bug, Baja stuff, or anything comon to
all VW's. I will also take cash if you have
nothing to trade. Just drop me a line if interested.
