Hi Bob,
Probably.  Especially if you build a good engine for the job.  We have been 
very happy with our 1641cc SP and 3.875 R&amp;P with .82 fourth gear with 
215/75R15s on the rear.  When we install the pre-late1962 rear wheel wells in 
we will have to use a 205/75R15 in the rear and are thinking of trying a 3.44 
R&amp;P with .82 fourth or maybe a .89 fourth.

&lt;&gt;
Best way to understand it is to tach your bus for 15 minutes and and see 
where 1,500 and 3,000 RPM are in the forward gears.  Then when you do change 
to a differant tranny you have a set of numbers to go by to understand the 
differance between them.
Anyone who want to take a ride in our 1960 panel with freeway flier just make 
prior arrangments with us and we will be happy to!  Mike A. from Salt Lake 
got a ride in it this last spring, was a blast to see the shocked expression 
on his face when he experienced how it kept up with most of the traffic in a 
70 MPH zone and was still quite enough in the front seats to talk in normal 
levels!   Eric&amp;Barb
