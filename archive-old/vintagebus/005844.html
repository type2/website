Hi,

Is Freon still available to run an older unit &gt;
&gt; Awhile ago, I purchased an A/C setup for a VW, thinking I may
salvage it for
&gt; some parts for my own custom setup.  Well, I never did :-)  However,
it is
&gt; collecting dust and it's open to anyone who wants to buy it.
&gt;
&gt; First, I should explain this is NOT your typical A/C setup.  It's
main unit
&gt; is designed to go behind the rear seat of a bug, with ducting that
blows the
&gt; cooled air out from the rear tray over the headliner, and you use
the
&gt; sunvisors to direct the flow.  The main unit includes:
&gt; - all wiring
&gt; - ducting pieces
&gt; - condensor, condensor fan, etc. (I assume it requires a hole to be
cut back
&gt; there for exiting air)
&gt; - evaporator, blower fans
&gt; - dryer, expansion valve, thermostat, and all other misc. devices
except
&gt; compressor and control knobs
&gt; - all plumbing within these units - needs only plumbing to and from
&gt; compressor
&gt;
&gt; In addition, it also has the control knob unit and the wiring for
the
&gt; controls that is to be mounted under the dash and a mini-York
compressor
&gt; that has never been used.  Currently, it is configured for R-12.
&gt;
&gt; The kit has no instructions.  However, after playing with placement
for
&gt; awhile, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out.  You could use it
behind the
&gt; rear seat of a bug as intended or perhaps in the rear passenger area
of a
&gt; bus... (just brainstorming).
&gt;
&gt; Although everything should be in excellent condition (looks good,
never been
&gt; used, no cracked hoses, no bent pieces, etc.), I really can't make
&gt; guarantees.  If my sources were correct, this kit was originally
sold by JC
&gt; Whitney some time ago.
&gt;
&gt; The kit also comes free with constant nagging calls to me to help
out with
&gt; designing various aspects of the system :-)
&gt;
&gt; Anyone interested?  I'm in Southern California and I want next to
nothing
&gt; for the kit.  I really only want $60 o.b.o. for the whole thing.
E-mail if
&gt; you're interested...
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Shad
