&gt; &gt;Obviously SOTO is a bust, so what other clubs out there are actually
&gt; &gt;producing a
&gt; &gt;newsletter.  ABC, Box on wheels??? Who?

There are several good small-venue newsletters.  Common Gear is a good
one. The Frauline ( VolksWomen) is a great publication, Splitzine is my
favorite bathroom humor, The arizona Bus Club puts out a great monthly
newsletter, and Ty Hodges at Volkswagens of Western Oregon has been
putting out a good little Oregon cenetered VW newsletter for some time,
with tech reports from Washingtonians Barb 'n' Eric....
