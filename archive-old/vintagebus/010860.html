Hi Mike,

Whoa!  That will be way too much play!  1/8&quot; is .125&quot; and 1/32 is about 
.030&quot;, making it a big differance.  You will not be able to see the endplay 
distance visably between the MC and pushrod tip.  What you have to do is to 
back off the pushrod until you can get it to wiggle up/down slightly with 
your finger tips.  Then while wiggling the pushrod with one hand pull down 
the brake pedal with the other hand and visually watch for how much movement 
it takes for the pushrod to tighten up against the MC.

&lt;&lt;Can anyone explain why the master cylinder only releases pressure at the 
end of travel (i.e. no compression of the cylinder)?  Is there some kind of 
orafice that the piston passes only at this location that allows for fluid 
release?  Just my curiosity getting the best of me!&gt;&gt;
Best to take an old junk one apart to really understand how it works!
