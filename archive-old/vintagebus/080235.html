Subject: Coil help please!

Had my compufire burn up yesterday (smoke and bad smell when I pulled 
the cap).  In my haste to get the truck back running I think I hooked it 
up backward...doh :-[  While doing some investigating I noticed that I 
have + 12v coming from the negative side of the coil as well as the 
positive side.  Is this the way it should be or has my coil shorted 
out??  I know this is noob stuff, and I should know this, but I just 
don't want to burn up the new compufire module.  Thanks for any help!!
