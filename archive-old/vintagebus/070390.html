i recieved this e mail regaurding a roof rack i have for sale on the samba,good day, my name is james mark,i am from united states of america,i buy all kinds of goods for my client who come from different parts of the world. i have many shipping compinies in some west africa countries. there is a client of mine who is willing to buy your wood slat roof rack which i saw on your website and i happened to find out that the cost of the wood slat roof rack was $395 so i informed my client about the cpst of the wood slat roof rack but he said there is no problem with tha cost.            My client said i should tell you he would be issuing you a United States certified cashers checkof $5695 while you wire to me $5000 through western union money transfer point which in paying for the shippers that will come to your location for the pick up of the wood slat roof rack immediatly the check has been cashed at any cashing store center in you location.  And he is also giving you a compensation amount of $300 in the effort it will cost you in doing all this processing PLUS the cost of your wood slat roof rack$395 making the total sum of $695 for your all.   So you will be expectinga certified cashier check of $5695 will you wire me $5000 through western unionmoney transfer point for paying for tha shippersand you keep the remaining $695 for the cost of your wood slat roof rack and the compensation of your effort in doing all this So if you agree to all this terns and agreement let me have your full contact information to where my client will be sending the check to like this NAME...........FULL ADDRESS........CITY...........STATE.....COUNTRY............ZIP CODE.........CELL/OFFICE/HOME PHONE NUMBER........alongside with the picture of the the wood slat roof rack if availible looking foward to your responseBest Regards, James Mark......
