Subject: Re: [VB] holiday gifts (friday)

I bought bugster preasents for its anniversity- when I had had it for ten years it got new shocks, brake hoses, new taillight lenses and I finally fixed the reverse lights.

For my 61 15 windows 40th birthday last year (april 11th) I drove it to the Kelley Park/ Red Barn events- about a 2K mi round trip the way I did it.   I had shortly before finished putting a rebuildt tranny in it, but that was just a maintenance thing, not a present.

&gt; since it's friday, i thought i'd post a question that i've been wondering about the last few days:
&gt; 
&gt; how many of you out there are planning on getting a holiday gift for your volkswagen(s)?
&gt; 
&gt; historically only about half the time i get something for my vws during the holidays.  however i almost always get something (doodads or maintenance related) for them on their birthdays.
&gt; 
&gt; last year all my running vws received holiday gifts but i actually only provided one; my single cab got its new bed welded in place.  my beetles received gifts (very nice) their from someone other than me and a bus lover at that!
&gt; 
&gt; cheers,
