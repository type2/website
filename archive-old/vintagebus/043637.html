&gt;I finally went and picked up an old bus that I've known about for a 
&gt;while. [...] I ended up changing 3 of the tires with some I brought.
&gt;The last one actually held air.

That picture with the tube sticking out gives new meaning to &quot;tires
so bald you can see the air inside...&quot; :)

&gt;We pulled it to the road and then wenched it up onto the trailer.

Strong ladies...

&gt;There's a 40hp engine. Don't know if it's original or not. 
&gt;It's number is 5228076.  [chassis] 461833

This engine number would be approximately mid-1960, so the engine is 
about a year or so newer than the Bus.  Muir says the &quot;bastard&quot; 40-hp
started in May '59 at 469 506 and Doliwa says it started May 19 at
469 447.  This puts yours about a month early to originally have
the &quot;bastard&quot; engine, but maybe it had one and got changed out, OR
it didn't have one and was changed out anyway on the recall by a
dealer who wasn't careful about checking the chassis numbers.

As far as the Bus' condition...look at the &quot;as bought&quot; pictures of
Thom's '54 RHD 23-window on vintagebus_dot_com.  I would say that yours is
in better shape than that.  IMHO this bus is very save-able...if it
is beyond you, sell it to someone who can fix it up.  Again, just my
opinion.

Nice find!
