Subject: Brakes revisited

While doing my really late 25000 mile brake adjustment I had time to remember
all the things I wanted to say about the 67 braking system and forgot. so here
goes.

The main reason I needed an adjustment, desperately, was because my pedal was
dangerously near the floor and I had to pump them up for any quick stopping. I
know, I know, I took TWO time outs for that one. It's amazing what one gets
used to. There is only so much fluid in each set of brake lines and your wheel
cylinders can only travel just so far. When it got to the point where I was
pumping and praying that was enough. It's a good thing that I NEVER let anyone
borrow my dub, no matter what the condition.

While adjusting the brake shoes I noticed that a couple of the star adjuster
brakes, the little sheet metal clips that toggle the star, were broke off or
missing. These seem to be attached to the back plate and looked to be spot
welded on. Are there replacement pieces that you can replace them with or do
you have to replace the back plate?

Also, for those looking for another 67 MC to replace their worn out one, I
saved about $120 and bought a $49 72-79 bus MC and the adapter plate. My
resivior was fragile and I broke a nipple off so replaced it with a wrecking
yard one off of a 79 Rabbit for $5. The stopping power of the 24mm MC over the
old 22mm NC is quite noticeable.
