How is the glass installed in a Safari frame, 
or for that matter, a pop-out frame?

I know that the glass is surrounded by a metal 
frame, but it looks like the glass is inside of'
a C-channel, there's gotta be an opening somewhere,
but how is it kept from opening?
- - - 
the frames (pop out and safari) are two pieces.   If you look, you will find a
seam.   On the pop out, there is a scraper sealoutside the frame- it must be
removed to exposed the screws.   The two halves are screwed together at each
seam.   There is a  rubber seal between the glass and frame.

It is more of problem to get it apart than to keep to from coming apart.  The
little screws have usually been there 30+ years and try to become one with the
frame by rusting.  One must be careful takeing them apart.
