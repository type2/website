I owned an early '65 Double Cab (VIN 265000987) so it had the earlier church key style decklid with associated rear apron.  I don't recall it being any different than a regular bus rear apron.  I think decklids and the catch for the decklid on the rear apron changed to pushbutton midyear in '65, but that still wouldn't affect the apron itself.

Hmmm, what am I missing?
