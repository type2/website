Busses and Boards at High Rock
Sunday August 28, 2005!!!


Event Website:
http://www_dot_milkmachine_dot_org/highrock/


What is it?

Busses and boards at HighRock will be a gathering of
VW busses and drivers, for a day of Picnicing,
Barbequing, and recreation. This will primarily be a
bus event, but there is an excellent, long, mellow
hill for those interested in skating/longboarding. All
busses welcome, split or bay. During the summer,
HighRock is a popular hang-gliding spot, with a
breathtaking cliff and overlook. The event starts at
1pm - and goes until 6pm. plenty of time to watch some
hang-gliding going on.

Where is it? 

Mapquest map is linked on the event website:
http://www_dot_milkmachine_dot_org/highrock/

HighRock Overlook is located on Pen Mar High Rock Rd.
near South Mountain State Park, in Cascade, MD. Those
coming from the north should head to Waynesboro, PA,
then south from there. Those coming from the south
should head up MD Route 15 North. Drop me at email if
you need help with directions.
