I just found this. Get set to drool.  It may help you out in the swap meets
and the bone yards.  Although lacking in bus content, (its there you just have
to look!) Henrik Gustafsson's page has a large documentary section on vintage
Volkswagen accessories and also scans of a Danish VW accessory catalog COVER
TO COVER.
Its a hell of a page:

or &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://homepage_dot_calypso_dot_net/~ci-17825/welcome.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.
Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  SOMEBODY GET THIS BOY A LINK!
Dan
