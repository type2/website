Well today I didn't get a helluva a lot done on the redux boxes.  The
welding company I was renting my argon from really screwed me over on the
bill.  I gave them back their bottle on Friday and swore them off.  I'm
going with another company.  Unfortunately, I needed a welder this weekend
and I didn't have it available due to the aforementioned problem.  A
workmate of mine who lives about 20 miles from here took pity on my plight
and welded the nuts on the cap.  Using a handy piece of metal I found in my
scrap pile (which was already bent and had a hole drilled through in the
right place all by chance!) and bolt, I managed to remove the cap - it came
out really easy.  The other one was tougher and it broke the weld so
tomorrow, I'll send it home with my friend (who deserves acknowledgment in
name - Jeremy Post) and have him zap the nut on again.

I spent about 1 1/2 hours tonight thinking and trying to remove that lower
inner nut on the stub shaft.  WOW!  That mutha is tight therefore, I lost
the battle for now.  I'm thinking that either an impact or clever trick is
needed here.  Off to the archives I go!!!
