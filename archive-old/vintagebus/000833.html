&gt; all companys are repackagers if there (oem)supplier runs out they will
&gt; purchase from an outside source i have gotten fag bearings in the same box
&gt; from the same supplier with the same bearings made in 3 different
countries,
&gt; real german are very hard to find (the box is german,the bearing made in
canada,
&gt; mexico,usa,france, etc. get my drift)... all are made to spec so it's your
call
&gt; i have used all manufacturers bearings and have not had a failure yet.

This is very true, and is becoming more prevalent in VW parts as a whole.
ATE brake drums are now mostly made in Italy, for example, and I, too, have
seen FAG bearings which were made in the far east and Mexico.  Dealer parts,
too, are no longer neccessarily German; as VW combines their various
operations they are shipping Mexican parts in genuine VW boxes, for example.
It will become even more difficult to identify true German parts over time,
as parts will be labeled &quot;made in EEC&quot; (European Economic Community) with no
specific identification as to country of origin.

Nevertheless this is not neccessarily a problem.  So far I have found that
you can, for the most part, safely rely on the quality of a reputable
manufacturer, no matter which factory built the product.  The Italian made
ATE drums are basically identical to the German ones, for example, and I
have yet to receive a defective ATE or SKF bearing regardless of where it
was made.  Even the Mahle/Brazil pistons and cylinders I have seen were
indistinguishable from the Mahle/Germany ones (but considerably less
expensive).  My usual approach is to stick with companies that have a good
reputation in their field, or those products that my suppliers have been
carrying for quite some time and have a track record on.  This tends to mean
more than country of origin.
