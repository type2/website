Ah, let me get this right...
A microbus (variation thereof) loaded with stuff for
the dump. Dump is closed due to a holiday. Hmmm...

I suggest going to the dump anyway. No one will know
or care...

At risk of revealing age let me add~
&quot;You can get anything you want at Ellis' restaurant&quot;
Watch out for Officer Oppie and 8x10 color glossies
with the arrows and descriptions on the back...
