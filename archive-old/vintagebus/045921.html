    Everyone knows that us AZ bus folk are a bunch of drunken, unsafe, 
idiots.  One need never have been to a Jerome Jamboree to know all about it 
and all of the people who are in attendance.  And of course we never have 
&quot;Tech Day&quot; at a local FLAPS where knowledgeble VW people help those in need 
to fix/maintain their rides before a major caravan and event.   No, Jerome is 
one event to miss for those who are safety consious.  I guess the safety 
minded people only go to events other than BBB and Jerome.
