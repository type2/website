heater boxes help cooling?  Significantly? &gt;&gt;

Hi James,
Good question!  VW did issue the Thing without heater boxes, but it was never 
a main seller of their's.  Often VW would experiment with things on the KG, 
bus, and type3 and later on when proven to be a good worthwhile item would 
put it in the bug which was thier mainstay for several decades.  It would be 
very interesting to have you write down temps of the oil, heads, and outside 
along with gear and RPM you are driving now and then have you install heater 
boxes and lower tin to see what differances in engine temps you get at 
simular RPM, gear and outside temps!  Would also be interesting to know the 
RPMs you cruise at and thing about your engine like fan width, lower pulley 
ratio, and cooler type.

&lt;&lt; I have no heater boxes, and my fan outlets are blocked off, rear tin holes 
sealed.  One thing that definitely comes to mind is that without heaters, 
there is no lower tin. &gt;&gt;

Lower tin helps force the hot engine cooling air out and behind into the air 
passing over and around the VW.  Otherwise it will just heat up the under 
sections of the VW body which will not help alot to keep you and your VW 
engine cool.
