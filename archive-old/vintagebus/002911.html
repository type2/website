My engine appeared seized the other day, rather not explain why, told the
story too many times already. Anyhow, the crank pulley, generator pulley, or
the flywheel would NOT turn. Today, took the heads/cylinders off, and then
bumped the flywheel, everything moves. No noises, no metal shavings in oil,
AND my pistons/cylinders are within spec, .014 was the space between the
ring ends. No seize marks in cylinders or odd appearing pistons, etc. Should
I just put it back together and hope?
