whoops, anyway, the good points continued
complete 36hp that spins
complete split case trannie
bus was driven to the spot it sat, so we know they were ok

bad points
hot as hell in Columbia South Carolina
surface rust and outer rust on rest of bus
one locked up front drum, made pulling it out of the woods a pain in the butt
