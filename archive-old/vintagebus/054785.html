HUH?

With a stock 1500 and the original transmission in my '66, 60 was easily
possible...65-70 was available if i needed it.  Normal milage was still
higher then normal in my '69 with 1600.

If you actually run the numbers, the gearing of the stock box in the '66
vs the stock box in the '69 are IDENTICAL.

A minor ring and pinion change (to a 4.12) and the gearing is now a tad
higher...I've slid up to 80, and still had throttle.  I dont cruise at
this speed in the '66 (i sure did in the '69 though..:), but it is
certianly available.


&gt; pinion(higher than IRS RandP).  And with the lowered stance, your bus will
&gt; look much better, and have less chance of flipping over in high speed
...
&gt; turns!!!!  Unless your bus is really slammed, the lowered stance will have no
&gt; effect on daily driving, if you keep on the paved roads.

No effect on daily driving, and yet will have &quot;less chance&quot; of flipping
over??  I've driven both the '69 and the '66 to the edge of adhesion and
beyond (on /good/ tires (yokohama 370 LTs, as well as BS RD 6whatevers)
and bad ones) and never flipped.  Now, of course, had i hit a hole, or a
curb, or something had obstructed my slide/turn, certianly i probably
would have rolled.  But that would hold just as true for a lowered bus)


I'm still trying to figure out if you are advising for or against the IRS
conversion, lol.

Personally, I'd say do whatever you want.  My advise would be to keep it
stock, and drive it like a bus....if you drive it like a porsche, expect
the handling, acceleration, and braking to be less then adequate, no
matter what you do.

And if you really think that 60-70mph in a stock bus isnt fast enough,
expect to put much more work into the brakes then you ever put into the
suspension or drivetrain.  For all of our sakes.
