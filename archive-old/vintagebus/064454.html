Subject: Re: [VB] Transmission Gearing

Ok everybody, I went with a 3:88 ring and pinion.  Any idea what kind of
speed I should be able to get at around 4k RPM(assuming stock tire size)?
Thanks.

&gt; I have a 1600 DP in my 67 Westy. 205/70 14 tires Stock gears with
reduction
&gt; boxes. I have an extractor exhaust with factory heater boxes, and
electronic
&gt; ignition.
&gt; I can see 80 mph indicated to keep up with San Diego Freeway traffic at
&gt; 4,300-4,500 on my tach. This is at 1/2 throttle cruise. It will rev higher
&gt; but over 4,700 scares me for engine life. I use Redline 20/50 oil at 3k
&gt; changes.
&gt; I do have disc brakes on the front.
&gt; I would like to do an IRS conversion with some gearing changes to reduce
80
&gt; mph  from 4,300 to about 3,800
