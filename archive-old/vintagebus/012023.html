&gt; What kind of paint were u using. I just got done spraying two part 
&gt; urethane acid etching primer on the nose of my bus and had a devil
of &gt; a time with it.

When I was using the low pressure rig, the only type I blew was
simple, one part auto paint (enamel?). The stuff that thins with
acetone. I have used the two part with the same gun, but with a
&quot;regular&quot; compressor, the kind with a tank. And after I was done, I
got this important piece of advice from a friend who has painted a lot
of cars with her father. When you use multi part paints, only mix as
much as you can blow in a couple of hours. Don't mix it all at once
(like I did). This can cause a LOT of problems. The paint starts to
cure as soon as the parts mix. If the mixed paint sits too long, it
turns to jelly, and it just won't spray. Even if you thin it, it just
isn't the same

&gt; 
&gt; I have sprayed lots of enamel through my airbrush, and am thinking
that  
&gt; that is what I should go back to.
&gt; 
&gt; I need this info urgently.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanx,
