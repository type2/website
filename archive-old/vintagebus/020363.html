&gt; It is a well known fact that Hippies loved the VW busses. I think we have 
&gt; Hippies to thank, in no small part, to the sheer number of busses available

&gt; not embrassed the venerable bus that we know and love which must have led to 
&gt; increased popularity and demand. 

Not many - if any - hippies bought buses *new*, so they didn't have any 
effect on their numbers.  The VW bus was a resounding success based on it's
commerical appplications, passenger applications, and reliability, long
before the first hippies staggered from the primordial soup.  The hippies 
bought them because used buses were cheep and plentiful.

&gt; Maybe what some fellow list members object to is not so much Hippies in 
&gt; general but the type of Hippie bus that was kept in disrepair and therefore 
&gt; effectively a nuisance to society by nature of it's unsightliness. I would 

Yup.  That and the implied pharmacological overtones.

&gt; have to agree that our beloved busses should be well looked after and present 
&gt; an excellent image to others which in turn encourages them to get into the 
&gt; hobby and lifestyle that bussing offers. 

For me it's a hobby, but I'm not sure about calling it a &quot;lifestyle&quot; - that
seems to be analagous with &quot;prop&quot; to me.

(in hindsight, this is really starting to sound like a friday topic...)
