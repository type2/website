Hey All,

Just had to tell of my experience today in Bartholomew, my '60
doublecab....after adjusting my valves (they were all about .002 loose) and
putting clamps on my fuel hoses, I was driving into Sebastopol to get some
tune-up parts and to warm up my oil for changing.  I came around a
sharp/blind corner where someone was making a left into a driveway, with
another car stopped behind them, and as I passed the second car, I heard the
shriek of tires and was astonished to see a D_at_dg* van hurtling directly
towards me sideways.  The guy was correcting, but the van was in a full-on
skid, and collision (with me) looked imminent.  I steered as close as I
could to the drainage ditch, maintaining my accelleration from about 30 mph
in third, and at the last millisecond, when I was expecting the nose of his
van to gush in the middle left side of my crewcab, I steered towards him,
and the joyous coincidence that his van was angled allowed me to both stay
out of the ditch and without harm from American metal.  I stopped on the
shoulder after 50 feet or so, and breathed.

His van was still on the road, miraculously unharmed, and no-one else was
involved.  Of course, by the time his skid was over, he was in my lane
facing the direction I was going.  He stopped, and we exchanged reliefs, he
apologized, and we were on our way.  That conversation was necessarily
short, as I could barely stand, my legs were shaking so.

Anyway, I was glad to find out that front camber/oversteer problems and all,
Bartholomew handled his first emergency situation well, and emerged
unscathed....I was actually surprised!  I didn't see any way out of that
one, but Bart and I, we're a team!

Later (drive alertly!)
