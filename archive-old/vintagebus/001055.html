Howdy all,

I'm going to be in Springfield this weekend, both at the Busses on 66
campout and I'm entering the show on Saturday.  I'm looking for some oddball
parts and perhaps somebody going to the show has them to swap/sell, so I'm a
askin'.

I need one 15&quot; rim to make a set.  Useable condition with enough clips to
hold a hub cap.  I'm also needing a stock air cleaner for a dual carbed type
3.

Like I said, oddball parts.  I've got some type 4 parts left, mostly engine
tin and an alternator, and a weber conversion carb with manifolds to swap.
Also a lot of miscellaneus type 3 parts.  Or cash, just let me know what you
want to do.

I'm really looking forward to this event.  It's not the biggest for sure,
but just all around nice.  Go if you can.  Drop by and say hey, I'll be in
the Elvis Powered 66 deluxe.

Curt
