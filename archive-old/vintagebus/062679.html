Subject: RE: [VB] That 70s show bus

In the Electroglide movie..
Did you notice the hippy roll down the rear window and blast that cop with 
the rusty shotgun for trying to return his license?  Wonder how they rigged 
that.  A rear window that rolls down.

[...]
&gt;Speaking of famous bus',  I saw an 1973 flick called 'Electroglide in Blue' 
&gt;  A motorcycle cop in AZ hassled a hippie in a 63 standard.  Also notice in 
&gt;the newer flick ALI, Will Smith is in South Africa or something and there 
&gt;is a bill board w/ a Kombi!
