It was a mix of wheel bearing grease and transmission fluid, I don't
recall the exact ratio, I think 1 part grease to 2 parts fluid.  The
idea is to slow down the 90wt so it doesn't leak out as fast.  I used
a pump-type oil can to squirt the mixture in.  It helps if you set the 
mix in the sun for a bit to make it less viscous.

&gt; Hey Thom I was wondering if you could share you steering box mixture you 
&gt; mentioned a few months back.  Something like 2 part stay-lube 1 part 
&gt; straight 50 or something.  Also is there any tricks I should know to 
&gt; draining and refilling my steering box.  I'm still slacking w/ no Bentley w/ 
&gt; a great working box, just thing I should put some new lube in the beast for 
&gt; friendly preventativee maintenance.
