Subject: RE: [VB] Spindle threads

I am a Baum Tool dealer way cool tools, I will be getting a shippment of
catalogs soon to send out. Also on another note, when I was on the Snap-On
truck getting Auction goodies (for BBB VI), he showed me a tool box
supplement with just VW tools.

Subject: RE: [VB] Spindle threads


size is 18x1, and the left side has a left handed thread (reverse than
normal &quot;righty-tighty&quot;), so to die the fronts, you'd need two different
dies.
baum tools, although pricy, sells all the larger size taps and dies for all
those weird vw things, such as spindles, rear stub axles, etc.
their phone number is:  1-800-848-6657, or http://www.baumtools_dot_com
i don't have a jobber account with them, or i could maybe help as far as
prices and ordering, but my guess would be in the $40 range each for the
dies for the front spindles.
good luck.

&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; Any help would be appreciated.  I took off my drums today to check my
&gt; cylinder, and the previous person who did this mangled the threads when
they
&gt; put it on.  Now I need to, if I can, find a tap for the spindle to try and
&gt; repair the threads or replace the whole spindle.  Does anyone know what
the
&gt; thread size is on a 67 front end spindle and if I can buy that size tap?
