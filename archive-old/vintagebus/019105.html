Hi everybody,

I spent last weekend down near Dallas at my friend Dennis' shop helping out
on the continuing restoration of my '59 Double Cab Pick-up.  There's been a
lot of movement on this Bus lately, in fact I'd say he's about 3/4 finished
with the body work and then we'll move on to painting it L 31 &quot;Dove Blue&quot;. 
The gates are now gorgeous and the bed deck is improving all the time.  I'm
starting to get excited again, and can almost see the light at the end of
the tunnel on this one.

While there, we also pushed our newest Split-Bus acquisition out of it's
deep storage space and outside into the fresh air.  I had to take a wide,
soft bristled broom to knock off the 1/8th inch layer of dust off this June
of 1959 Double Door Panel Bus.  It hasn't been registered or used since
1964 and has a total of 55,801 miles on it.  Using the proceeds from the
event, this Bus will first be purchased to become the official BNNTA event
Panel Bus.  Future proceeds and my pocket money will slowly fix her up. 
When you see it this summer it will only be cleaned up with it's original
patina, but healthy and running.  It will haul all the event supplies and
become the event office/storage bin.  No more crawling though all of that
event sh*t to get into bed in our other campers at night during the event! 
 Wooo Hooo!

This Bus (model #215 - VW delivery van, double doors left and right sides,
LHD) was produced at Hannover in June of 1959, it's port of entry into the
USA was Houston, it was initially registered to a Texas business as a
delivery truck, and then to a private individual for a few more years.  It
came from the factory with &quot;M&quot; codes 175 (Bumper guards - export markets)
and 360 (anybody know what this one is?).  Since then it has been parked in
storage in Texas and pretty much forgotten since 1964.  Dennis has owned
and stored it near Dallas for about the last 10 years. 

Since this Truck comes without it's correct original &quot;bastard&quot; 1200cc 34bhp
engine (which was removed when &quot;recalled&quot; long ago), the early 1961 Bus
engine that I bought many years ago from Rick Babor will become the power
plant for this Panel Van (I knew there was a reason I bought and held onto
that motor!).  Tom Niedernhofer and I have already fired it up on my garage
floor and initially it sounds very healthy.  After I fully check this motor
out and tune it, it will be hauled down to Dallas to be installed for the
return trip home sometime late this Spring.  All the brake components will
of course be replaced and all fluids will be changed out, etc.  

This Bus still has it's original coat of L 53 &quot;Sealing Wax Red&quot; factory
paint, although in some spots it's sun bleached and faded into the primer,
it has very little surface rust anywhere, no rot at all that I've found
yet, a few small dents and scrapes, and there is only one fairly big dent
to be pounded out and repaired around the front passenger side headlight
area.  It was missing three of it's original five 6/59 &quot;date coded&quot; 15&quot;
rims (14&quot; Bus rims/tires in their place), the correct rear apron and of
course the correct &quot;bastard&quot; 1200cc 34bhp engine.  So our search is on for
those items.  The original battery floor metal is in very nice condition,
but I will need to locate another Bus battery hold down strap.  The seam
thread on the grey front bench seat upholstery has let go in several spots,
but the upholstery material itself looks great, no tears.  I hope I can get
it re-stitched somewhere.  Some P.O. extended the stock shifter by cutting
the original in the middle and welding in a 4 &quot; rod to make it long enough
for their tastes.  That I've got to replace!  All of the original exterior
rubber seals have been cooked in the Texas sun and heat, so all of the
rubber will be ordered and replaced as we put it into service.  It still
has it's original radio block-off plate in place, and there are no extra
gauges or holes in the dash.  The driver side windshield is cracked, so
I'll be trying to locate another used &quot;Delog&quot; logoed windshield soon. 
Anyone...anyone???  The inside cargo compartment floor and interior looks
great for being a commercial parts hauler for a while.  Other than the few
missing items, and items whose condition I'd like to upgrade or restore,
this Panel Bus is in much better condition than I expected!

Well, I just thought some of you might enjoy hearing about some of our
latest VW exploits.  If you have a line on any of the above items that I'll
be trying to locate for this old truck, please let me know.  We'll be
working on her from now until we can debut her in her original condition
(patina and all) at this Fall's &quot;Busses Nowhere Near The Arch&quot; event.  Our
priority will be to keep her as stock and original as possible, but to keep
her functioning as a work horse, not a show queen.  Thanks for any
assistance offered, and I'll try to keep you updated now and then...
