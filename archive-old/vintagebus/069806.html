Spit, fingers and smell.

Spit on the case it doesn't sizzle, can pull out the dipstick and hold it, I
smell the oil to see if it's burning.

See if the oil light comes on at idle, that's it

Ronnie, you are always the one I think of when the thought of a loaded bus
doing serious hauling comes to mind! :-)

Do you have oil and head temp figures?
