Here's a site: http://www_dot_desertteardrops_dot_com/red.html  ,
the good old home made trailer. 

Work continues on the DC. Took a 55 mile Thing drive to CB Performance in Farmersville for an idle jet for the Dellortos. They have a ton of fuel injection systems for acvw engines. They have a thick catalog with pretty good reference data. Their site, www.cbperformance_dot_com is being revamped and should be up soon. Claude (I assume; he had all the answers) said a company crew used to go to every VW show. 
The linkage on the duals is not the best geometry for the task.  Karl suggested that I slot the fan housing to get a better angle on the cable. A whole day off the job to play with the toys.
