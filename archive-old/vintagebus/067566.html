&gt; Hi Mike,
&gt; Anytime the Pitman arm is removed and replaced on the steering box there is a
&gt; good chance this arm will be repostioned in such a way that somewhere in its
&gt; operating arc the arm will become parallel to the drag link causing the
&gt; steering to lock up.

Hmmm.  Since the pitman arm is the thing that rotates, it cannot lock up.
If it were the drag link that provided the input, it could, but not when
the rotary arm is the input.

IIRC, the pitman arm has a match mark with the pitman shaft.  I know from
experience that there is only one spline that is correct.  Any other
spline will give limited steering to the left or right.  The Bentley
manual explains the procedure.

Once you get the pitman arm positioned correctly, the drag link can be
adjusted to center the steering.  If the drag link adjustment is
insufficient you will have to pull the steering wheel and reposition it on
its splines.  If you do this, don't forget to reposition the drag link
adjustment to mid travel before pulling the steering wheel.
