OK,

My new theory is that it must be how I'm driving. I'm putting the pedal down
too far.... there is a point where the extra gas does nothing to make me go
faster... just dumps more gas into the engine.

Next weekend I will be gong to Yakima (couple hundred miles), so I'll make
sure to feather the gas pedal to just maintain the speed and nothing more.
I'll see if my MPG goes up.

Thanks for all the replies.
