was writ:

    For the last couple of months I've been on the lookout for a style of
front door locking mech that was found on my early 64 21window. I don't
have the part number here in front of me, but it was the pull style handle
with a turn key lock(see late 50's bugs).  Luckely my 64 came with two
really nice front door handles but I need two more for another project(the
daily driver).  So far I haven't been able to find a repo(although Oval
Motorsport in Federal Way, Wa has a excellent BUG style).  As I understand
it, the bus version has an added hook of metal on the release part where
it did not have that on the bug version. 
 - --  --  -
the pull out style handles were used until sometime in Dec 63- so up throough
early 54s came with them.    The passenger door was only lockable from the
inside, and the drivers from the outside.    If you want to have both lockable
from both inside and out, you can put passenger door mechanisms (inside the
door) on both sides, and locking handles on bothe sides.     

Keys- well if you want all keys to match the early 64s are tricky as they came
with  a T series key, so a smallish number of early 64s with T series pull
handles were made.   from 54 to 63 the doors came with a number-letter-number
series key, such as 1Z7, or 2D5.  You can find the code on the handle and have
a key cut to code at a locksmith.  

Also, in late 60 or early 61 they changed the cab doors- the later pull handle
doors have an indent where the handle goes on (not the finger indent, where
the handle actually attaches to the doors) an dthe earlier ones are flat
there.  The bzel on the handle changed at the same time, so the handle will
fit.   So  the year of the bus you want the handles for  determines the type
of handle (or more specifically- the door, in case the door was switched)

If you want your bus thief proof, make sure your vent windows (the triangle
ones in the front doors) have good latches (these are a pain to switch), the
sliding windows have latches with springs, and the seals arond the sliding
windows are also good.
