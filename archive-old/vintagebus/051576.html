...yet I couldn't sell a running, straight, non-cut, driving '55 single cab for $1800

&gt; I have a 1961 Bus for Sale it has been sitting around for a long time but it 
&gt; has much potential..no rust and it very straight.  It has it's rear wheel 
&gt; wells cut (you can get replacements for around $50 each side) and the inside 
&gt; panel where the spare has been cut (I have the piece).  Let me know if you 
&gt; are interested.  $3000
