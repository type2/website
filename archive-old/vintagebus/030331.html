Subject: [VB] SC Bed Slats

&lt;&lt;So if the slats are hardwood which makes perfect sense and standard
from the
factory as everything seems to imply, does Oak makes sense?  I am
wondering
on the availability of Oak in Germany as opposed to some other types of
Hardwoods.  Not trying to be difficult just curious.  Any German listees

have thoughts on Hardwoods there?&gt;&gt;

I dont know how original this would be, but if I were doing the wood
slats, I would use Mahoghany. It's expensive but has great rot
resistance and it looks absolutely terrific. I have been lucky enough to
find some in the local marina dumpster. When they rip up old boats, they
just throw the stuff away. It's a terrible waste and, at the price of
the stuff, a foolish waste as well.
