Subject: Found a bus stash
Mime-Version: 1.0

Took today off from working on the Kombi again to check out a Thing that my
wife is interested in. After looking at it I told her about a tip I had got
on a VW yard in a town about 75 miles away. So away we went.

I've driven past it plenty of times and never saw it. From the highway you
have to know to be looking for it to see it. The landscape kinda hides
everything. The owner wasn't around and I was told he doesn't live near the
yard. So I squeezed through the fence and took a look around.

There were quite a few bugs. Then the scattering of dunebuggies, things,
Type III's, waterVW's, ect. Among all of these were about 10 different
split window busses. Almost all of them were of the '59-'61 era. Most were
Kombis or standards. There was one 15-windwo deluxe. I didn't really do a
lot of digging and didn't open any doors since I was actually tresspassing,
but I did peak through some windows. All of 'em had junk piled in them. So
I don't know alot about the interiors. But from the outside there seemed to
be plenty of good glass, bumpers, some emblems, pull handles, some
tailights, headlights,doors, lids, ect. Actually looked like at least 2 or
3 of these would be capable of being saved. I'm not sure though. I'll have
to get in touch with the owner and go take a real good look. There are at
the very least quite a few parts...if he'll do that. I'd love to make a
deal on all of 'em and get 'em as I can. Finding busses is a blast.
Especially this many!!!!
