&gt; From what i understand the sump only has one
&gt; disadvantage and that is the reduction of ground
&gt; clearance. 

I would add:
-  potential loss of pickup tube and oil starvation!
   Since whoever built John's motor neglected to install
   such basic cooling components as air deflectors, do
   you think they took the time to properly install this
   sump??  I doubt the pickup is welded or brazed, 
   probably attached with hose clamp at best, chewing 
   gum, soda straw, or whatever was handy at worst.
 
-  cost of sump, cost of additional oil at every oil 
   change
-  Oil leaks where the sump mounts
-  risk of some road debris shearing it off
  Didn't Kyle have an engine grenaded by one of these??
mounting nut sucked into pickup or somesuch?
  If you have a hot rodded, non-stock motor you may need
extra oil capacity as the oil could be pumped out faster
than it can return to the sump. I run a mild 1776, don't
run high revs and check the oil level at every fill up.
For my situation the risks and added cost outweigh the 
benefits, YMMV
