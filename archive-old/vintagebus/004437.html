Well, another 67 Standard followed me home this morning. This one is a
non-walk thru camper. It has jalousie windows in the cargo doors, 3 strips
of glass that open and a half strip of glass along the top. The passenger
side has one large window with a jalousie on each end. It has almost all the
interior pieces in it. Any idea what camper conversion it is? It appeared to
at one time had a plate riveted on the right dogleg. There are no camper
codes on the M code plate so I don't believe it is a Westfalia. Here is the
plate numbers:
22 2   [built Feb 22nd, 1967]
425 seat belts
025 lap belt anchors [may explain the weird brackets under the bus!]
114 6 pop outs [not any more.....]
UF  San Francisco port
2212  Standard LHD, right side cargo doors
381383  velvet green + pearl white w/mesh grey
7097972  vin # [not counting the 22 in front of it]

My last 67 Standard was all pearl white.... it was very early in the build
run [July 5th, 66] and did not have back-up lights but did have the dual
master cylinder option [430]. This one has back-up lights and dual master.
