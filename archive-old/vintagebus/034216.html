holly moly what a turn out, over 150 registered buses and at least another
50 that didn't.
chili cook off was great and you could smell that around the campsites
later.
first and second raffle also went well with some great stuff.
the 66 westy walkthrough camper is up to 975.00 in the auction, it's the
zebra striped one in some of the pictures.
the redhead lady in some of the pictures is my wife, how could someone like
me have someone like that? I'm the one on the stage with the balding head
and the goatee.
found a great little accessory there, an original VDO foot operated
windshield washer foot pump with a switch that turns on
the wiper when you pump it!
the BBQ dinner went great with over 150 people eating, not bad for for first
attempt at this, not as many as our FREE taco's Friday, at least 300 people
for that event.
the kids had a great time with the piñata and they got to play with
play-dough and painted a square back (couldn't find a bus for it this year)
so Sunday we'll wind down and everyone will head home, with nothing but a
good memory of a very good time,  A lot of listys here so there should be
some interesting stories in a few days.

I'm tired so good night
