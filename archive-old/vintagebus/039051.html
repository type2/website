Some of you may remember my carb saga when I first installed the freshly
rebuilt 1776 in my 58 single cab last Spring and how disappointed I was with
the performance.  (I had picked up a pair of Weber &quot;Brazilia&quot; carbs at a
swap meet and installed them since they were cheap and I needed something.)
Well, I finally got around to replacing them with a pair of Weber 40 IDF
carbs this weekend and all I can say is WOW!  

Before the swap, I couldn't get the engine past about 4K RPM and pulling
that speed on the highway was dependent upon wind direction and grade.  Now
I can put my foot into it and bring it up to 5K with no trouble.  1st gear I
have to be a little careful of because severe wheel-hop is a only a twitch
away and he's quite capable of hanging his but out in 2nd!  I know I
wouldn't be able to keep up with Craig's &quot;Rosie&quot;, but at least I could put
up a good fight now.

If anyone's interested, the carbs are set up with 28mm venturis, 125 main
gas, 190 air, and 50 idles.

Disclaimer:  All performance has a price.  Driving this motor
balls-to-the-wall and at high RPM will, no doubt, decrease it's life
significantly.  But I HATE this motor and intend to drive the snot out of it
until it blows!  The case itself is truly of demon parentage.  I wish I had
spent the extra $$$ and bought a brand-new case for this rebuild - then I'd
feel differently about it.  Trust me!!
