I went over to look at it. Original seat upholstery with just a few rips!
Rest of interior replaced with fuzzy, non-stock panels. Body is sound,
straight, rust free. Rockers &amp; arches in great condition, evidence of
collision repair below gas hatch, 1' x 1' area with bondo ripples. Has tow
bar welded to front, owner towed it behind RV. Large 6v ah-ooga horn bolted
on roof, non-VW. Jerry-can brackets on each side of rear window, other
mounts/holes in rear gate, both bumpers &amp; nose. Gates in great shape
otherwise, sprayed in bed liner isn't too thick.(zolotone?) Window seals
replaced 15 years ago, owner resprayed paint a few years ago, white. Engine
