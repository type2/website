Subject: Re: [VB] How do you convert a 65' from 6volt to 12 volt ?

Hi, when I pick up my Splitty one of the first things that I want to do
besides the body work is convert it from 6 volt to 12 volt power. Does
anyone know how to do this? Is their a kit I can buy or something? Lemme
know.
--------------------------- Clip -------------------------
#1) 12v Alternator. Some have solid state regulators (Motorola) some have
separate point type regulators.
#2) Mounting bracket
#3) Fan belt
#4) Spark Coil, Ballast resistor
#5) Light bulbs all including instrument cluster.
#6) 12v Instruments (fuel tank sender ok as 6v no change needed).
#7) 12v Starter and solenoid
#8) 12v Battery
#9) Fuel pump if it is electric. Fuel shut off and chokes on Carb if they
are there.
#10) That insane emergency, dimmer, turn signal flasher control.
Best way to get this job done is with parts from a donor bus 68-72 (might
be wrong on this). Anyway it needs an upright engine in it. With carbs.
Shortcut to all that work:
