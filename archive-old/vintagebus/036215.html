Hi Todd,
Why not seal your windshields or are you running safaris?  If you are running 
safaris, we have been pondering the pros and cons of installing drain tubes 
in the corners of the lower windshield frames of the body.  Draining it out 
through the bottom of the nose of the bus.  Resulting in no water inside the 
interior and thusly alot less dash, floor, frame rust.
