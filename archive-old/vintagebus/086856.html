Subject: Inner torsion arm bushing replacement. Easy?

Talked to the guys at Wolfgang about how to change out the inner torsion arm 
bushings. The word was to:

1. jack up the car and place onto solid stands
2. Remove the wheel.
3. Loosen the axle boot on the axle side
4. Unbolt the shock
5. Unbolt the RGB
6. Wire or otherwise hang up the RGB out of the way
7. Remove the outer cap and bushing
8. MARK THE ARM AND THE BAR
9. Pry or pull off the arm, it should only pop down about 1/8&quot;
10. Install new bushing with talcum or graphite.
11. Place arm back onto bar using marks.
12. Lift bar and push into place.
13. Install outer bushing and cap, Anyone have a torque spec??
14. bolt on the RGB
15. Tighten the axle boot.
16. Install the shock
17. Torque the RGB to spec!! Drive about 10-20 miles and retorque.

Does that sound about right? Anyone know about the short pop down of 1/8&quot;???
Does it stay on the splines after the pop down??
How is it to lift the arm back up and slide it into place?

Installing just the outer bushing sure made a difference on the freeway!!
