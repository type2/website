hi,

I'm having trouble with the throttle cable return.
I put a spring on the pedal and that helped, but 
the cable still gets loose when everything warms up,
so the effect is like the pedal goes down and it seems
like you can't get as much power (but I know it's just
the cable length.)  How tight should the cable be at 
the clevis?  

Transporter workshop manual says there's a barrel spring at the fanshroud
end, but I don't think I have one.  Also wonder if that's an oldschool
thing. The barrel bushing produdes 5cm from the back of the shroud, should
it be flush?  Pushing it in a bit seems to help, so I put a fuel line
clamp behind the shroud to hold the bushing in, and that helped a bit too.

The spring on the carb and my choke are working great.  
This is after changing from dual dells to a solex 34, so
I anticipated having to mess with the linkage.
