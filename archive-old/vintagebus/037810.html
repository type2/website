Another story for those interested:

A couple years ago Dave, aka Mr. Green/White '63 15-window, my brother, and I were at a Vallejo show when this guy rolled in with a fully restored 23-window.  We admired it, nice ride.  A few hours later we see a few cops by it talking to the owner.  A little eavesdropping and we come to learn that the owner had recently purchased the Bus.  Unfortunately for him, it was stolen, with the PO on hand at the show to reclaim it.

Don't know what how the story ended but I'm sure the guy was out the purchase price...

- Everett
'55 Bus - not shiny enough to steal but it better be there when I leave work.
