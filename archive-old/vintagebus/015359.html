They have them.  If you mis-install it, you can bind up the cable,
which then proceeds to saw through it.  Eventually, it hangs up on the
metal fitting at the end of the tube.  Gotta make sure that the ends
point straight at the fittings they go into once it's in place, or
it'll wear through again.

I'd be more suspicious of the spring plate on the clutch than the
spring on the tranny housing.  I've had new plates be bad.  Might as
well plan on replacing the friction plate and probably the throw-out
bearing while you're at it.  Fortunately, all of that's pretty simple.

Turns out there's a factory procedure for adjusting the clutch with
the engine out.  You might want to do that, too.  Described in the
Volkswagen Transporter Shop Manual, published by Volkswagen.  Cover is
grey with red lettering.
