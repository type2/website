Subject: Gas cap

We don't normally stock a gas cap for my '67 westy, so I had to order
one last time I needed one. It was non-vented, so I had to drill a small
hole in it to keep vacuum from building up in the tank. It seems to be
of poor quality, and will sometimes turn farther than it should if I'm
not careful...

I recently installed a baywindow tank (which is already vented), and
since the angle of the filler neck is more shallow, if I fill the tank,
it sloshes out of the hole I drilled in my cap (I kept the old filler
neck). Its making a nasty mess on the side of my already fugly bus!

Anyone know who makes a decent quality non-vented cap for a '67 filler
neck?

david
