Subject: RE: [VB] EMPI

I emailed Glenn Miller, the guy that wrote those articles...  I'm sure
he'll get a kick out of it.

Andrew mused:

Well, we've had one magazine do an article on the rise of the EMPI
empire.
When are we going to see an article on the fall of the EMPI empire.
Reason
for asking?  I bought an EMPI muffler today...
