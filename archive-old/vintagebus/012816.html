I had something similar: the starter bushing was worn bad, coupled with
a crappy Kragen starter, meant that things would only work if the starter
stopped in the right spot.  A new starter fixed the problem.

A bad starter bushing will ruin the starter, causing the armature to
short to the windings, and grind itself up.
