:(  &lt;--- Jealous

That sounds like a great trip; I'd stock up on spares and go for it!

&gt;
&gt;Alright here's the plan I have about 4 weeks of vacations saved up.
&gt;Planning on driving from Lemoore, CA to Tampa, FL and back taking in the
&gt;sights along the way.  I need to stop off in OK either on the way or on the
&gt;return trip to see my mom, but other than that the trip is wide open.  Was
&gt;planning on taking my '66 Sundial w/ stock tranny and reduction boxes, 1600
&gt;cc.  Some of the mods I will be doing prior to this trip are installing a
&gt;set of Kadron's going to a dual circuit brake sys. and gettting new tires
&gt;and brakes and I would really really really like to install a larger fuel
&gt;tank.  I also need to aquire a tire tool or star that fits my bus I won't
&gt;have the air tools on the road.  Well am I crazty?  I mean should I just
&gt;leave the bus at home and drive the Mercury?  It's just me a my little dog 
&gt;a
&gt;Jack Russel Terrier.  I have driven from Long Island NY to Porstmouth Va 
&gt;and
&gt;on to CA before in 3 days, but that was just stupid and in a Chev Cavalier.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance and I really apreciate your advice.
