Subject: Someone needs to buy this..... JET KART

One of you Richie Rich types needs to buy this little Jet powered Go-Kart 
and put a VW Bus or Bug body on it. Found it while cruising Erape.  Item no. 
1814391188.  You would be the &quot;I&quot; in &quot;IT&quot; if you had this as a match to your 
show car or drag car.  Can you imagine this heading down the strip at one of 
the Bug-O-Rama's?  Be good competition for Paradise Xpress :)

Gerald
