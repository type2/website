And a while back Dave Easterwood told me that many commercial vehicles came without rear view mirrors. I'm not sure he stated it explicitly, but I inferred that passenger buses (standards) were supposed to always have the rear view.

Well, I have a '64 green and white standard with pleated seats and no rear view...never had one. Original interior.

Go figure. ;) Joe
