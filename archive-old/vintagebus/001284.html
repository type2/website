&gt; My curiosity is still peaked.  Ron, what are some of the goodies you
&gt; brought back from Europe.  Anything for a late '55 23 window?


Most of what I brought back is for '68-up busses.  But there is a wild card
in the deck.  Among my purchases was a crate of &quot;various NOS parts for
pre-1968 Transporters.&quot;  I won't know until I unpack the box whether there
are any pearls among the oysters.  Frankly I'm not exactly expecting a box
of pristine barndoor parts or anything that lucky, since the stuff had
already been picked through by a couple of European collectors before I got
to it, but then again you never know. :-)   In any event, the shipment is
already late coming from Europe, and I have yet to receive a firm date of
arrival, but I'll let you know as soon as I get it.
