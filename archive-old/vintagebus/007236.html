Mad daydream #45, while Aufever and I were scouring the junkyards this
weekend. Get some soft aluminum, bend, cut and drill to match the vent
repair hatch. Pull some round vents off a bay window bus, mount in the
new vent panel and aim that air where you need it. While back, I picked
up an aftermarket panel that has flimsy plastic aimer/closers in it,
looks vintage though with the stiffening bead around the edge. Buspilots
have a pic of one, but their link is down.
An aircraft style air nozzle would look cool, but they're small.
OT, a neighbor insists that the vents in the DC and Deluxe are air
conditioners. That's what her parents told her while riding in their
deluxe.
