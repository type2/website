Unfortunately that is not a lot to go on, but here is a shot:

What is the compression for the cylinders?  If there is compression the
motor should be fine enough to drive.

Maybe the points collapsed?  Mine does not run right with out of whack
points and timing.

Maybe the carb has crud in it and slowly clogged the thing up?

I doubt it is the tranny.  Other problems would arrise like popping out of
gear.  Check the fluid level to be sure, if it is toast the thing will stink
like burn.

If the clutch was slipping it would rev like crazy but go nowhere...  Also
the clutch disc would stink you out.

Check the engine oil, adjust the valves, change points, adjust timing (if
possible), and put a new carb on (you can always have a spare).  I think
this may slove the problem somewhere in here.

On long shot maybe the fuel pump is barely working?  Oil would have gas in
it as a clue, should be able to tell from the dipstick.

Hope this helps.
