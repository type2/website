In some sadistic way, I am touched to see that our 'Douaniers' are
capable of extending the same gracious welcome to US VeeDubbers that the
US Customs Agents routinely display to Southward bound Canuks.

&gt; I say more, we were detained while two of them ransacked the vehicle.
&gt; The bottom line is,we were entering a foreign country with every right
&gt; to do as they pleased. They found nothing[had nothing],we went on our
&gt; way and enjoyed the day.
