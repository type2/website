Subject: Enough of Ebay

I don't know about the rest of you, but I have enough of the 'ebay'
word.

If you want the most you can possible get on every single item you own,
I doubt this list cares to know what you have.

I thought this list was more about getting/receiving information and
exchange of parts and literature.  I've always thought that one of the
things that early bus owners had in common was a sense of family.  This
ebay crap has too many of you greedy.

&lt;sigh&gt;  I almost feel better  :'&gt;

Well I might have. . . .until the flames fly.
