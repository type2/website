 &lt;&lt; ok i just picked up two blocks at a swap
  and an trying to look up the codes and am getting confused
  
  heres how it goes #1   AH 215177
  normally this AH would be 72 up 1600 but it only has 6 digit i assume the 
 7th could be a 0 and vw just omitted it.
  
  #2   B  5007834
  
  it could be a 70 but they start at 6000some thing
  or is it a 68 with a B code
  or is it a 61 and the B is just screwwing me up?
         dont you just hate it when the #s dont match up, if anybody could 
 help i would be grateful.
  
  thanks again
  Jose &gt;&gt;
 added info the # 1 is dual port 1600 with the small studs w/steel inserts
  &gt;&gt;
what you have is an  A case and a B case.  The B case should be a early 1600 
bay window case, dual relief but the older alloy.  The A case is a better 
version, later better alloy less likely to warp, and has the factory case 
savers with small studs.   Some of the A cases have those some don't, I think 
they are nice.   So dont worry about what exact VW they came out of, and if 
you are building a motor I recommend the A case as it is the better alloy.  
Just in case your motor gets too hot sometime, that alloy can take more abuse.
