Subject: nosecone and e-brake cables

I'm gonna try putting the old transaxle from my '59 Kombi into my '61 
double cab. The '59 had a big nut transaxle in it, but it would 
sometimes want to grind going into 2nd. When I went to swap it with a 
used '67 transaxle...I noticed the shiftrod was bent and was not 
moving freely. I was dumb and didn't know any better at the time. 
When I put the '67 in it did basically the same thing as the one I 
pulled out.

So anyway....I think that I've got a good working big nut transaxle. 
Only problem with it is the nose cone is worn out from the trauma the 
bent shiftrod put on it.

Can I swap the nosecone from my current '61 tranny to this ?later? 
tranny? I'm think yes......but thought I'd check.

Also, what about emergency brake cables? I imagine I'll have to 
figure something out there. I believe I've got the '62ish e-brake 
setup with the cables coming up the handle and mounting on it inside 
the bus. I bought a later set of cables and made some spacers so 
they'd work with this bus.

With the big nut transaxle on this bus which cables will I need to use?

I know all of this isn't presented in the clearest manner, hopefully 
someone will understand the questions and be able to give me some 
help.
