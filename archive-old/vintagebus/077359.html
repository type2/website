Subject: Dist Q

So I took my 010 dist out and replaced it with a vacuum advance 205M. I set it at 7.5 BTDC with the vac hose disconnected at 850rpm. After I re-attach the vac line it goes up to around 10 degrees! Is that right? I've never used a vac advance, as if you couldn't tell! 
I have a 30 pic 1 on a 1600cc BTW.
