 stock... &gt;&gt;
Hi Craig,
Agreed, but have to inform you that a stock from the factory accessory was a 
positive two clamp for two batteries cable for bug and there surely had to be 
a simular part for the bus.  Even with 12 volt the battery in extreme cold 
temps can not produce enough juice to start a cold VW.  According to Winter 
Service booklet from VW of Canada Ltd. a fully charged battery at 32F will 
only produce 65% of what it would at 80F.  At 0F it will only produce 40%!
