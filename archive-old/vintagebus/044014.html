cost of the T-I looks to be about $35 + shipping
1000 pgs or 500- 8 1/2&quot;x 11&quot; sheets  double sided, not 3 hole punched
~ 1 week printing turnaround after the &quot;Go&quot; signal
The T-II will be another 2 weeks from now at the earliest, and should be
cheaper as it is fewer pages.
what volumes do you want ?  T-I, T-II or both?  and how many of ea?
reply to me
I will think about putting up the printing costs for this over the
weekend.  Not that I'm worried we here on the list are like those folks on
eBay that bid on something and then never follow thru with finishing up
the deal.......right?

c'mon!  one time quick print, get the hell out of dodge kinda thing!
And remember to say &quot;Steve who?&quot; when the men in the dark glasses and
trenchcoats come to talk to you! :)
order both!
