Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Speedo Issue, Solution?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Ladies and gents, I do believe I have 
&gt;&gt;&gt;a rounded out dust cap.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Comments?  Other thoughts?

it says in the muir book, that the square end of the cable has a tendency 
to round. i had this happen to me, and to fix it i put a spacer behind the 
clip to pull the cable out 1-2mm more and that gave it enough bite to 
work, temporarily of course....

good luck, easy fix either way,
matthew
