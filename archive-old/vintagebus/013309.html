Thanks for all the replies, but since I only paid $500 for this bus I
don't feel too bad about cutting it up.  I've actually already done a little
welding and cutting on the wheel wells and around where the engine will sit.
(cargo bay)

I guess i'm now committed to finishing this thing off.  Whenever I get time
I'll post some pics so you all can see the progress.  Thanks, and keep all
the great help coming!!!
