Fellow listies:

I am trying to help a friend out on his 62 23 window.  He has bad front
wheel cylinders and we all know how expensive they can be.  He is
wondering if he can remove the whole spindle set up at the link pins,
will a spindle set up with link pins from his 67 parts bus fit the
earlier front end arms?  Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Jason Bizzare
