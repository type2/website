&gt;Wes, What you have there in the pic IS mesh Platinum.
&gt;The color on Wolfsburg wests site is called Mesh
&gt;Platinum, but their new repro color is a bit more
&gt;gold.

Alright, my next question on this topic.  Platinum is a silverish color.  I 
am not &quot;anal,&quot; but if I order the platinum seat cover set from Wolfsburg 
West or TMI (same thing I've heard), am I going to get a seat cover with 
gold skirts?  In this case, would it be wiser to simply order the mesh grey 
set, as it almost seems to be a closer match.
Thanks as always,
-Wes
