Subject: 2002 VW Bus Calender

It's that time of year again.

The 2002 Custom VW Bus calendar is ready to print. Just like last year, send
your pictures to printme_at_electricpage_dot_com and we will create a custom
calendar with your (and other) VW Vans adorning the months of the year. We
have improved the artwork, so this years model is even better!

If you are interested in ordering a calendar, email me
(samtoll_at_electricpage_dot_com) or my front desk (printme_at_electricpage_dot_com) with
your order. Anna answers the phone and will be glad to answer any questions
you may have if I am not available.

The Calendar is 24.95 plus shipping and handling. U.S. Mail ($5.00), UPS
($6.50) and FedEx ($20.00) are all available.

Last year over 30 happy VW Bus owners looked at their favorite mode of
transportation. 

This year we will donate 10% of each order to the Thom's server fund, so
make sure to order one for you and one for a friend :).

When sending your personalized pictures, try to get us as high resolution
pictures as possible. Most digital cameras will take good printable pictures
if turned to the high resolution settings. If you are scanning a photo, scan
it at 300 dpi at about 4 x 5 finished size.  Zip or Stuff the pictures and
email it to us or ftp it to ftp.electricpage_dot_com (username = clients,
password = clients)


Send your check or money order to:

The Electric Page
1915 21st Street
Sacramento CA 95814

(916) 737-3900

Or call us up with your credit card number and we will phone order your
calendar.

Thanks for the interest!

Sam
