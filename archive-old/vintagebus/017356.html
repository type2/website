Subject: Air scoops that work!

I've been toying with the idea for some time now of making a variable pitch 
air scoop. Today I put on two old scoops that I had sitting around (thank 
you Andre).  I rigged some metal hose clamps as brackets for the fronts of 
these things. By setting it up this way I can vary the pitch on the scoop. I 
started by putting the scoops about two inches further out (at the front) 
than if they were just sitting flat on the body. THE RESULT!!!! Yesterday at 
about 90+ degrees air temp the oil temp rose quickly to 260 F. This has been 
my problemfor a few weeks now. With the new scoops on I drove at least 
50miles today at 60mph or more. The temps never passes 235 F. Still not the 
best but a definite improvement.  The verdict: It certainly isn't a pretty 
addition to the bus but It did help the temp!   :)
