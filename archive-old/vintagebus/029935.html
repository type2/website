&gt; Not to be a pr*ck, but why wouldn't you want to share a picture of one of
&gt; the rarest busses any of us has ever heard of?  And why, especially after
&gt; some are questioning its existence, *wouldn't* you prove us wrong?  Go
&gt; ahead, make me look like a fool - post a picture, if you dare.
