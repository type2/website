Hi,
Since you can see that the torsion bars move they are not frozen.  You should
jack the front end up till the tires are just off the ground and grease the
front end until the new grease starts to come out of all the joints.  Then you
should adjust the link pins tight and then back them off about 1/8 of a turn
to allow movement.  Lastly check if your shocks are adjustable.  You might
have to stop by your local parts shop with the part number off your present
shocks and see if they have directions on the adjustment or that if they do
have the adjustment.   Eric &amp; Barb
