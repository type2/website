Subject: A seemingly stupid front brake question

Um, hello...

I won't talk about the new tires I just got...all 4, things are better (not
perfect, just OK).  Much better quality tire, though.

I noticed a slight pulling to the right when I was braking, so when I got
home, I went to re-check the front brake adjustment.

Wieerd thing is, on the right side, the lower adjuster is almost all the way
in (can't really see a thread), and the upper adjuster is about 1/4&quot;-3/8&quot;
out.  Upper one looks normal to me, but the lower one isn't at all
normal...in fact, it's mighty wierd!

The left side is normal looking.

I did check for proper seating of the shoes in the slots in the cylinder
pistons, and they are fine.  Pads are in decent shape, with plenty of liner.

Thoughts?

Thanks!
