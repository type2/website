&gt;Supercessions are listed at the front of the parts list, dunno if they
&gt;were scanned into the online version.

The online '58-'67 parts list has the supercessions; look for the
&quot;Supplement&quot; pages in the very first section.  Note that the 
supercessions will only be the ones that happened since the printing
of the parts list.

I don't think the '50-'54 has any supercessions, but I don't think they
had superceded any parts yet, either.
