Hi all,

I feel i must state for the record that my hypothetical model was not
intended to say that people tend to *start* a business with deception
in mind.  I feel that most people have good intentions and really do want
to help, but they sometimes get lost along the way.

Unfortunately, when the business starts failing people tend to loose their
way and less than scrupulous things seem to happen.

What i expect from a business:
1) if you cant fill my order... tell me and send my money back, or tell me
you are too broke to and you will try to do so in the future.  I am much
more likely to forgive this kind of thing than lying and just avoiding me.
2) if you are too busy to fill an order promptly let me know that i can
expect a delay.  In extreme cases refuse to take more orders until you can
reasonably expect to fulfill them.
3) if you make a mistake shipping the wrong thing to me, pay return
shipping. if i have to pay for others mistakes, i am unlikely to come
back.

take care all,

Steve
