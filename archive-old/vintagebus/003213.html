Did anyone else not get this issue? or just me. Would have been Nov/Dec
2000. Need for my collection. Rec # 75 and #77 with # 76 inside. Anyone got
a #76 Nov/Dec on outside for me with #76 on inside also? Rec #78 today. Nice
work Dave and Ed.  4 weeks till Colorado. Join the caravan leaving Havasu,
get here Wed Aug 8th.
