Subject: Re: [VB] Cant get Tie Rod off

Works well, but, might I suggest that one back the opposite site of the
steering knuckle with a larger hammer so as to apply all the force to
distorting the taper and not bending the knuckle.

&gt; You do not mention where you are hammering on it.  Trying to pound it
&gt; straight out does not work!  We have had good luck hitting the part the tie
