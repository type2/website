Walkthroughs are more desirable and less prevalent.

for the 61 and earlier walkthrough they are nicer if you want a big crick in 
your neck from sitting askew -  the seat is not behind the steeing wheel.   
BTDT long  road trip too. WHy would people want walkthroughs?  you lose that 
nice storage space behind thefront seat/spare tire location.   Less 
comfortable for passenger in a walkthrough all years of split.     That is my 
OwnPersonal Biased Opinion.    

saw a walkthrough 15 window 51 deluxe.

when I looked for a repacement when my 15 Window got hit, I knew that it had 
to be a bench seat hardtop bus,  no walkthrough, no pop top, no rag top, any 
thing else was open in terms of year (as long as its a split) and model.    
found a 65 hardtop bench seat westy.  cool.
