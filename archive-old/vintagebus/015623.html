Subject: [VB] Found a key / adios

I'm just about to start believing in things having karma :-)  I was playing paranoid about the ignition lock just days ago, but fortune smiled upon me!  While cleaning out the bus, lifted up the shag carpet + rubber mat combo up front and, wouldja lookit that, there's a VW key!  It had obviously seen better days, and was rusted quite badly.  I could only make out an &quot;L&quot; for sure on the code, which Clara had said appears on '67 keys...filed the worst of the rust off, put it in the lock, and click!  It works!  I tried it in the steering lock, it fits but does not turn.  I'm halfway happy about that, as in my mind that means the electrical portion may work, and the switch fell into disuse because of the tumbler...

I pulled out the interior to get a look at the cargo floor.  It's perfect, except about 1/2&quot; along the cargo door rocker.  One thing I was wondering, the carpet + padding was lain down on some plywood, which was *damp* and rotten when I pulled it out (it folded!), yet no rust on the floor.  What gives?  Is it because the primer was still there?  I was *not* expecting to have a solid cargo floor with all that carpet and crap everywhere.  There's more rust on the rear deck than on the cargo floor.

I leave tommorrow for Cleveland to pick up the Kombi and start on a week long road trip.  I plan to meet up with a listee in Tallahassee who is as of yet silent on the list...hopefully he will introduce himself soon :-)  He has two early buses I'll be interested to see, as I'm more of a late-model man.  So g'bye :-)  I will be checking mail intermittently, but I promise not to spout crap into your inboxes for a bit ;-)  I do plan to install a CDI ignition and Pertronix in the Kombi before I head back down, and will share my impression of it when I return.
