Greetings Fellow Bus People!

I've been off this list for a while.  Just didn't have the time to keep up
with all of the mail.  Now I'm back and thought I would update you on my '61
Single Cab.

 I just got the original 40 horse engine finished.  It has been totally
rebuilt (no piece untouched) and repainted to factory specs.  It looks
great.  I'm really pleased with the work.  It runs nice and smooth.  Now
that I have it moving, my next project is getting it to stop.  I've managed
to round up all the parts (with the exception of rear brake shoes-----  my
parts guy can't find them,  Any suggestions?) I'm gonna replace all the
wheel cylinders, master cylinder, and use new flex lines.  After that, the
wiring is the next problem.  It seems it has a new wiring harness (a plus).
However, it's not in quite right.  I'm gonna have to get someone else to
tackle this one.  I'm far from qualified to take on this job.  I'll keep you
posted on the progress.

Now,  I know there has to be someone out there restoring a bus and in need
of some original pop-out windows.  These are the square pop-outs.  They came
from a '66 Bus.  The frames have some rust in the lower corners, but I have
sanded them a little and I think they will clean up pretty good with a
little more work.  I have removed the latches, cleaned them and put them
back on (They look brand new).  They still have the original knobs on the
latches.  One of the windows is fogged pretty bad and would not be
serviceable.  This is the orginal glass with the sekurit logo on them.  I
don't know what they are worth.  I have no use for them.  I knew someone
would need them.  Make me a good offer!

The bus may end up being crushed, so I've tried to get over there and strip
as much as I can.  There isn't much left.  The 60/40 split bench seat (with
rips) is still there.  What's left of the engine (which still turns by hand)
and the transaxle is still there.  Are there any parts that I should try and
get that are hard to find for the old buses?  Let me know and I can try and
get them.
