Subject: '58 wheel minutia and tire ????
Message-ID: &lt;99b40339.249dcffc_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Recently I was lucky enough to find a '58 single cab in a salvage yard.  Even 
luckier, per the serial number the salvage yard single cab rolled off the 
assembly line a mere 537 units after mine (2-3 days?) meaning all the parts 
on it would be absolutely correct for my truck  8-)  

For the most part it was pretty complete - crank tin apron, lumpy bumper, 
gates, etc.  Price was right so a friend and I bought it.  It even had all 
four 15&quot; rims with matching 5/58 date code.    My question regarding the 
wheels is that two of them have the crows foot pattern around the lug not 
hole and two don't - again all off the same truck and all date coded the 
same.  Is this correct / normal or are they all supposed to be one way or the 
other and not the mix of the two styles?

Also, what is the stock tires size / height for a '58?  Now that I have the 
right rims I want to put the right size tire on so the speedo reads correctly.

Thanks,
Dan
