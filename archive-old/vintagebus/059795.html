Subject: BN4 gas heater help

Hello,

I have a 1970 Westfalia with the BN4 gas heater in the engine compartment.  I need to replace the gasoline resistant &quot;quad ring&quot; in the top of the old style aluminium fuel filter because it is leaking.  The question is where do I find this part?  I have called some local auto parts places around Vancouver, BC and they haven't even heard of such a thing.  Has anyone found one and where?  Perhaps it has another application that it is used for.  Thanks for the help.

Paul
