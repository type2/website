&lt;&lt; Sounds like a broken speedo to me but you really never know. You need to 
get the cable off (drink a Red Bull!) and hook a drill to one end and make sure 
it isn't broken. I assume the cilp on the dust cover is still intact as well.

I've had the hole in the dust cover round out too, so the cable didn't turn 
when the wheel did.  Just something to check.  

try vise grips on the cable?   someone with small hands?
