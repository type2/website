Subject: Re: [VB] Lost a hubcap!

Hi Todd,
All you need to do is buy an original or good quality repro hub cap.  Then 
paint the new and if you are that picky the three other hub caps you have not 
lost yet.  Better yet you might want to buy two or three new hub caps to 
paint at the same time so you have spares as you loose them!  ;-)
  Think 1949 wan last year for large logo.  1950 on was small logo hub caps.
