DUMP AOL NOW. You can get better service without the annoying part of AOL's

Bus content? Got 6 new bus toys for christmas. 3 matchbox, 3 german made 
nice toys.

Havnt driven the bus in quite a while. Shame really. Bus is rotting away 
outside and I need to do something with it. Tom Noble rebiuld is reaching 
the end of its life, leaking oil, and really wimpy.
