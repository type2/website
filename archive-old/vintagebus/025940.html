Mike,

&gt; MANASSAS VA,I havent been there in 5 years but back then it was a good

I'm probably going to the show in Manassas, but I've heard that Bug Meet 4 will
be a little bigger.

&gt;
&gt; show.but there is also a show in PA it is the  BUG MEET 4 I have never been
&gt;

Only reason is the friend I'm going with is racing his 64 bug.

&gt; there and i was wondering if anyone has been to either one and could tell me
&gt; what one would be a show for type 2 parts.

I could look for some items down there if you want me to!
