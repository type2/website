Subject: Bus Website location  (BD bus conversion project in Europe)

Last year i was reading the story of a guy who was
converting a 60's bus into a BD bus.  He was somewhere
in europe and was doing it all in a bodyshop on his
spare time.

Anyone know this web site?  I have lost the URL and
can not find it.

Thanks
Matt
