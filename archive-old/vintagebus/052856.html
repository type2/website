Subject: 1966 bus preheat system?

&lt;&lt; What does the entire carb preheat system consist of for a 66 bus? I have 
the aircleaner, the weighted flap, and a hole in the tin. Hose is easy part, 
but what is UNDER the tin? I suppose there was a different heat exhanger?

Hi AL,
Go to vintagebus_dot_com, check out the 1958-67 bus part manual in Obsolete 
Air-Cooled Documents.  Go to page 143 and take a gander at part figure A55.
