Hi Garret,
The button is to allow the mounting point for the magnetics inside the plugs. 
 You might do better by grinding a dimple in the hex tool you have to match 
thebutton in the plugs.  If that does not work well try rapping or lightly 
hammering three times on the hex tool with a hammer to jolt each of the steel 
plug threads loose from the aluminum threads of the tranny case.  Note we 
said rap or lightly hammer three times to loosen and not wail on them!  This 
type of jarring of the threads works very well for the relief valve plugs.
