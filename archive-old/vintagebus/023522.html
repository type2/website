&lt;&lt;  Within 5 min, i wasn't finding much of anything to my
 liking.   &gt;&gt;
I too was there early, It seemed like all the gold was bought/traded among 
the sellers before the public came in. like all those middle seats with sold 
signs on them. I did find some screw terminal bulb holders and early wiper 
arms for the 59 though.  Nice barndoor single cab in the lot.
