Subject: emergency flasher

i have a 68, which has the 9 pin so i'm hoping vintage bus list can help
too. i fig'd out almost all my night light/signal driving woes except one
thing: emergency flasher. can someone tell me whether the ignition has to
be on for their flasher work? i have a 75 and the flashers work with the
ignition off. seems most cars work that way, no? (on the 68 i get the bulb
on the switch flashing red, only when the ignition is on)    - steve
