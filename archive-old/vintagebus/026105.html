Subject: [VB] Rear lights 64-67/65 Kombi sighting
Message-ID: &lt;3820B221.C96600A9_at_stmarys-schools.pvt.k12.md_dot_us&gt;

I saw some strange tail lights today.  They were the regular shaped oval
tail lights of the 64-67 busses, but they had two bulbs.  They were
mostly red, but the upper (I think) part was amber, like some of the
more modern tail lights.  They were original looking, and they did say
&quot;Hella&quot; on them.  Are these original?  BTW, they were installed on a
green 65 Kombi in a park and ride lot in Davidsonville, MD.  Anyone on
the list?  Also saw a blue mid 70's loaf in the same parking lot.  Very
strange for the area...
