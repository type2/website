Does anybody know where I can get a Headlight Switch for my 6 Volt 66 Bus?
None of the supplier catalogs WCM, RMM, Mid-America have them listed...I
need one, mine is pretty patched together already. My stop lights are on all
the time, and my drivers side headlight has gone away. I've changed out the
stoplight switch, but the problem remains.
The PO had removed the wires from the old stoplight switch, and instead
wired a horn button into the system and taped it to the steering column,
then apparently when he stepped on the brake pedal, he pressed the button
for brake lights...

Also...I'm thinking about replacing the wiring loom completely, I'd
appreciate hearing from someone who has done this in the past. It seems all
my wiring has been patched together with crimp-on connectors and haphazard
color/gauges of wire. My thanks to Thom Fitzpatrick for taking the time to
post the wiring diarams, without your hard work I wouldn't be able to get
this far.

Regarding employment, I've really enjoyed learning what my fellow list
members do for a living..I sell advertising for a trade magazine publisher.
Currently I'm working on a business to business magazine for the meat and
poultry processing industry. I travel through Illinois, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, Iowa and Nebraska. Next week I'm flying to Washington DC to
deliver a speech to an annual meeting of an association of equipment
manufacturers. I'm also deeply involved in develping a new website for meat
processors.
In my spare time, I'm under my 66 camper trying to keep the electrical
demons at bay. My daily driver is a 96 VW Cabrio.
I'm planning on being in Effingham on the 22nd and 23rd. So I hope to meet
some list members and members of the DBG.
I have 7 VW's, only one bus, and it's my favorite.
Sorry to ramble on so long...
