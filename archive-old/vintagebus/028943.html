&gt; Why powdercoat that stuff, it won't match your paint...

I was planning on painting them white, but at those prices, I think I'll be
using the standard paint.  No way I'm going to paint them with the equivalent
of gold plate prices.

So....I guess the question is, what color were the wheels and bumpers of the
'60 double cab when it was new?  Same as the body or something else?
