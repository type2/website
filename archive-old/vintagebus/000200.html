Subject: [VB] Budget Dove blue paintjob ?
Message-ID: &lt;0.4cb36691.2557ac14_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I just got a double door panel for my friend to use  with his furniture store.

Its dove blue, or better said WAS dove blue , most of the paint has faded  or 
burned off.

Since he wants to use it now we  need to do a quicky paint job for the winter.
Just to make it presentable........
then next year we can pull it apart and do it right 
(yes we plan to paint over the dents)

Any cheap paint ideas ?????
