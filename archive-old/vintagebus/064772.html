Subject: Re: [VB] Staying Warm - air vent

Good idea, think I have a bicycle inner tube around...  I like cheap 
solutions to fixing the bus, and then I could get it done this weekend!!!!!   
But I don't quite visulize how this works. 

 I mean, around the flap that opens/closes the vent  are you doubling it over?
If not, the tube is curved so which way does the curve go?
Sorry if these are dunb questions

&lt;&lt; I pulled apart the air vent in the '63 DC, only two screws required a
 vise-grip to remove. The PO had replicated the seals with inner tubes. I had 
a
 26&quot;x1.5&quot; bicycle tube laying around, cut 4 pieces, mitered the corners so 
they
 would overlap and left it doubled up. \====/  Width is perfect. Single
 thickness works great for the panel seal. Use grease on the screw threads 
when
 reassembling, they get rusty.
 
 I also used some silicone caulk in the seams of the vent box to keep the 
water
 from dripping into the cab.
 
 One weird thing. The actuator/handle rod has flat spots. Mine are on the
 opposite side of the lock screws that look like valve adjusters. Do I have a
 RHD control rod?
