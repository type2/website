Subject: Another burnt VW bus!

Hi Volks,
Just in case anyone has been slipping up on replacing thier fuel lines and 
checking the grommet every two or three years due to not knowing or just 
forgetting.
Pat Callaghan Jr. on the Wet Westie list just lost thier 1977 Riviera to fuel 
line fire.  Yes it was a late model bus, but it was thier perfect camper they 
just got.
