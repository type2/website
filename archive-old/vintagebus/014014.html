&gt;Considering trying toinsulate to kill some of the engine 
noise to the cab....

I have had a great deal of success by using a Stinger product
called Thermal RoadKill Pro.  It has a sticky backing, for gluing
under the back deck.  I wrapped the entire cavity with it.  I even
pulled the gas tank and wrapped that cavity as well.  I also got 
a body man to fabricate a fire wall that goes between the engine
and tank, covered the backside (to the tank) with the RoadKill.

I'm not afraid of the insulation being sucked into the fan because
it is very well stuck to the metal surfaces.  It cut my engine noise
problem probably in half.  This is before my inside noise treatment 
and carpet instalation.  I am expecting a 60db-70db drop after treating
the inside and installing the carpet backing.

I found also that Stinger makes a carpet pad that kills roadnoise
almost as good as the best factory stuff.
