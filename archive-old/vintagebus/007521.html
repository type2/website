Subject: Re: [VB] How much oil?
Date: Mon, 7 May 2001 16:27:18 -0700

Ever heard of a Preluber?  This is an electric oil pump which starts the
flow of oil to the engine, coolers and such, before the key is even cranked.

If you had a preluber installed, oil changes are a snap... open the valve
and allow the oil to drain in a container.  To fill, use the normal means,
or another hose to the preluber.

Installed one on the Hummer... don't quite know how I would do such a thing
with my bus.

&gt; Basically, you want everything to be full before the pistons start getting
&gt; whacked by the fuel.  Get everything as full as possible, remove the
&gt; center wire from the distributor cap, and crank the engine until the oil
&gt; light goes out, then crank it for a few seconds more.  Reinstall the wire
&gt; and fire it up!
&gt;
&gt; If you have an option, install the spin-on filter upright and fill the
&gt; filter with oil before installing.  if you put the filter at the same
&gt; level as the oil pump/gallery and run the lines lower than that oil will
&gt; remain in the lines when the filter is removed.

&gt; &gt; I don't know really how much oil I should put in the bus now that there
is a
&gt; &gt; spin-on filter attached to it.  I know to fill up the filter before I
put it
&gt; &gt; on, but then there's a little over four feet of oil-line to fill up,
too.
