&gt; &gt; I scored a FAG rebuild kit at my local shop for $12.00 all the right stuff

&gt; &gt; will find
&gt; &gt; what you need.

Yeah.  I'd like to know the shop too. All the big parts houses cant get
them.

What can be done is to replace the orig master ( 211-611-021 Q) dual
circuit for 67 only with a 211-611-021 AA, which originally fit a 68-70
211 without vacuum assist brake servo. You need an adapter ring thingy
that allows this master to go in. Wolfgang or Wolfsburg West sells em.
Not cheap, but cheaper than the &quot;Q&quot;.  And the &quot;AA&quot; master should be
about $45 retail.

Original &quot;Q&quot; master cylinders are damn hard to find and expensive when
you can.  I recently spent several hours on the phone trying to locate
one  for a customer (or a kit for one) without success. Even the
boutique parts houses were fresh out.
