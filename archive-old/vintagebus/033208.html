&lt;&lt; Sorry about omitting the year bus I have.  My Westy is a 1965.  Thanks! &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
That does more often than not help!  :J)  The one you are looking for is much 
like the post-1968 bus hammock.  the poles for it are round pipe with bent 
clips welded on the ends.  The fabric is a dingy camoflage green and has 
cresent moon shaped pressed steel mounting brackets screwed to the body.  
Matter of fact the only main differance is that the post-1967 hammock has 
poles of equal length and the fabric cut matches them.  In the 1963ish-1967 
hammocks the front pole is shorter than the rear and thus the fabric is cut 
to match these.  You could easily cut a later hammock down and make it 
exactly the same as a pre-1968 bus hammock.
