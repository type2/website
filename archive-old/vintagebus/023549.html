&lt;&lt; I have try to adjust it between the 3 marks. It seems that the best result

choke, it helped a little. The idle got better, but it still stall. &gt;&gt;

Hi Lars,
First you need to make sure that you have the correct carb jets for your size 
engine, type of engine compartment, type of air cleaner, and muffler.  Plus 
make sure all the proper parts and pieces of your engine are in place(IE 
thermostatic bellows and flaps, and all the pre-heated air tubing going to 
the air cleaner.).  Then tune your engine properly and set the timing foer 
the distributor you are using.    Only after this can you hope to get your 
engine to run correctly.  If all of the above is correct then you need to 
adjust your choke to keep the upper butterfly valve in the carb closed 
longer.
