First I want to thank all of those helpful list members who got me this far

..... this wiring stuff is a confusing for a poor simple minded guy like me.


So now I have both brake lights working and the lil' bulbs in the headlight

buckets and both head lights high and low - and a new problem has developed.

Now the rear tail-lights don't work.  The rear signal lights and brake

lights both work fine but the tail lights don't come on when the headlight

switch is pulled out.  It's dark now so I can't fiddle with it but I've

checked the fuses and they appear to be fine though I don't recall them

being that thin - I think I'll change em ... but that can't be the problem -

I wouldn't think.
 -- - - - 
well, look at you wiring diagram and see which fuses operate the taillights.  
use a test light and see if it lights up when you plull the switch.  check 
both sides of the fuses.   This will tell you which sid eof the fusebox the 
problem is on.
................................


And a stereo - how should I wire that.  I currently have it just plugged

into a fuse but what is the right way.  And a cigarette lighter.  I

currently have that just plugged into a fuse but what is the right way for

that.  The cigarette lighter is just this cheapo thing I picked up to plug

my cooler into, I only rarely use it but does keep the drinks cold


TIA

I like to be able to use my stereo w/o the ignition on, so I hook it into the 
always on fuse, on the fused side.  If you want it to shut off when you turn 
the bus of, hook it into the on with power on fuse, the one next to the right 
most one.    
Ditto with cigarrette lighter/accessory plug.
