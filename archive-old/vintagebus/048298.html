Subject: Middle Seat Q's
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Someone a while ago stated the horrible fact that I have a late middle seat.  
I have an early 67 kombi with the full 1/3 fold.  Now I dont know if he was 
right or on crack.  I took the bus from a 71 in which the owner couldnt get 
the seat to fit.  I traded him an icebox for it and it fits mine perfect.  
Was there ever a middle seat such as this one that could be used in both loaf 
and split?  Im quite skeptical of this comment but i need to check into it.  
Anyone with some good shots of a middle seat with out the side kick panel?  
The guy said that the legs are right.  The have a diagonal bar from the back 
to the bottom.  Any ideas?
