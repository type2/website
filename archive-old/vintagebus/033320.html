So what youre saying Everett, Is dont be surprised when you pull up to pomona 
in youre barndoor (bus content). You and youre wife jump out, you wearing a 
poodle skirt doing the humpty dance and her wearing a wife-beater and dickies 
doing the twist? (Note the dichotomy of my 50s vs. 90s styles, schweet!)
