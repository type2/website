Hello 009.
Hello Moneypenny.

Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Anyway, that wasn't completely
pointless.
I've got a question or two about the 009 distributer. I've got one on
both my '60 bug w/stock sp 1600 and on my '67 bus w/stock sp 1600. I
want to check the timing and I've got out the old Muir book. It
specifically, and in great length, says not to use strobe timing lights
but to set the timing statically to the specs given in his pages
according to the number stamped on your engine.
My problem is two-fold. First, my engine numbers don't really coincide
with any given in his book, regardless of model and year. Second, the
guy's at the local bug store are telling me to diregard Muir because the
info he gives doesn't relate to the 009's anyway. They're telling me
that anything running a 009 needs to be set with a strobe at 3500 rpm to
27 degrees BTDC. From there they say to just adjust your idle, should
you need to, by screwing with the idle adjustment on the carb.
Both cars run like a top so I don't think anything is really out of
wack. However I do want to run them at the correct temp and for the best
mileage. Rounding out my dilemma is neither have a temp gauge, and the
bugs speedometer is completely out of commision while the buses speedo
works but not the odometer. This meaning I don't know if they're running
hot or not (nothing really indicates that they are - but I'd like to be
sure) and I can't really tell what sort of mileage I'm getting. The bug
has always seemed to get pretty good mileage just judging from how often
I have to fill it, the bus on the other hand I think could be doing
better.
Well, that's about it. I'll put my engine numbers here in case that
helps. Also, aside from being 12V with alternators, both engines remain
stock. Actually I think the bus came that way, but whatever...
Since I'm writing anyway, I've been using premium gas in both ever since
I got them. This is based on what Muir had to say about the octane
levels of leaded gas that the VW's were originally desingned to run on.
He also comments in the timing section about varying, a few degrees,
your timing based on the octane you run. While I'm gonna' be messing
with it should altitude matter much? I'm in San Antonio (pretty much sea
level) but this next month I am planning on driving the bus from here to
Phoenix on to the Prescott show then to Salt Lake city at which point
I'll head back down through Colorado and New Mexico. Should I plan
anything special with regard to what I've been talking about for the
bus?
I'm just trying to get a handle on all these different variables. Anyone
care to take the reins and put it all together?
Thanks again in advance.
