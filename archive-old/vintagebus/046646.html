 When painting axle tubes, is it wise to stop the paint right where the axle
 boot would begin?  Possibly preventing problems with the axle boot sealing
 to the tube?
 
 Or paint the whole thing, devil-may-care style?
 
 Thanks,

Looks like VW painted it after they put on the axle boots.   But I have 
painted them before installing on the trans, just be careful of the sealing 
surfaces.  I paint a bit further towards the flange than the boots cover, 
that does not cause leaks, but dont paint the flange area.  It does have 
friction, and needs a certain clearance, painting there will mean you end up 
with paint bits in your oil, and remember it will be in oil anyway so will 
not rust.
