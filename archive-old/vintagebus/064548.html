Hi Kevin,
You will just have to spray it with oil and work the pedal back and forth in 
both the around direction and slideways on the shaft to work the oil in 
between.  We have had the same happen to our SC twice and next time will 
[probably fit in a zerk fitting like our 1960 panel has from the factory.
