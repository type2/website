If you do decide to go with the alternator, make sure you get the stand,
too.  It's different than a generator stand.  Also consider that you can
buy a whole &quot;kit&quot; brand new with alternator,stand,pullt,strap and tins for
about $110 or so...

&gt;&gt; Mark,
&gt;&gt;      Answer, YES. The generator is a sort of analog function, going up and
&gt;&gt; down in effectiveness as revs change and load varies.
&gt;&gt; Alternators are more yes/no affairs. they come full on at just off idle and
&gt;&gt; stay there pretty much regardless. This is better, Go get it.

&gt;But if you don't need the additional amperage to run a big dumb thumpin
&gt;stereo, you may want to keep the generator. They last longer. No diodes
&gt;to poop out. (But then with a gen you have a voltage reg to poop out,
&gt;but it is easier to fit in the spare box than an alt) 
&gt;
&gt;I have alternators in each of my vee wees at the moment, and they are ok
&gt;too.
