&gt; I have a Stewert-Warner heater that has been refurbished and works
very
&gt; well. What is the going price for one of these? Thanks

About $15.  Please box it up and send it to me immediately!

Seriously, the price depends upon whether you have the other bits
needed to install the heater in the vehicle (timer switch, exhaust
pipe, ductwork, etc.)  Do you have any of these?
