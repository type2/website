&quot;Clowes, Robert&quot; &lt;topdawg_at_topdawg_dot_net&gt;
I have been thinking about it for awhile and have decided to sell the
panel the motor has been removed but the rest is all there it's clean real
clean I can take more pictures what I was wondering is do you know of any
serious buyers for a 63 panel it's lowered with busboys drop kit in rear,
safaris real nice inside 14 inch bus wheels match painted to the bus. I
would like to get 4500.00 for it without a motor but for a little more I
will install stock 1600 it runs great on the freeway and did sunset pass
going to Jerome in 3rd gear all the way up at 45mph. I'm getting ready to
get another family car for the family and don't get to drive it as much as
I'd like you can see pictures of it _at_
http://www.germanaddiction_dot_com/BUSES/Robert/robertbus_index.htm or give them
my phone number 623-848-6545 after 6pm during the week and anything on the
weekend. it hurts to have to do this but family is more important than
ever...thanks Robert
