Wow, that was insane!  If it's such an easy part with part #s in all these catalogs, pick up the phone and order it from the catalog.

I always expect any part deal I am making to take forever to do the deal, forever to ship, and I know it will get misrouted in shipping and take twice as long.  That way, I am always surprised, &quot;Wow, this came already!&quot; 

I have parts I've been trying to get for over a year, the people keep promising to &quot;dig them out of their shed,&quot; &quot;gotta wait until summer,&quot; etc., no biggie, as long as *I* get them.
