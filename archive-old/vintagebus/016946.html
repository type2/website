These are a Bosch item that was used in several European cars.  This
is one case where you can probably get it cheaper from a Porsche place
than a VW place, as I've heard that &quot;speed shops&quot; (Berg, et al) charge
a premium for these &quot;rare&quot; &quot;hard to find&quot; parts.

The pre-motronic 911's use them.  They work on the principle of a weight
at the end of a spring on the &quot;arm&quot; of the rotor; when the centrifigal
force pulls the weight all the way out, it contacts a metal tab which
ground the rotor, cutting out the spark.  It's quite disconcerting the
first time you hit the limit with one of these - not a very 
graceful way to cut you off, but very effective!

The cut-out speed is stamped on the bottom of the arm.  I've seen them
as low as 4800RPM for vanagon applications, to 7200, which is what I have
on my 911.
