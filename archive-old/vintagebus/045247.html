Subject: Im getting a new bus (I HOPE)
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Looks like I found the bus that I have been wanting!  A 1957 15 window 9 
passenger.  Hoefully I will be getting the deal worked out tomorrow or 
Sunday.  Asking price 4k.  Gonna see what else they can throw in the deal for 
a little more cash.  The plan is to put it back to original using the plate 
#'s.  Research it and restore it.  May take a couple years but I think it 
will be the best thing in the world.

So now first order of buisiness.  Need deluxe rear seat.  Thants about it 
right now.  Ill keep everyone posted and throw up a couple pictures when I 
get them.
