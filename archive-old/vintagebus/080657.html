Subject: Re: Heater boxes

Having driven a bus with and without heater boxes, I much prefer the 
heater boxes. Without heater boxes, the heads seem to cool down rapidly 
when the engine is off - which is excellent in the summer, but terrible 
in cold weather. Total PIA having to wait 3 minutes for the engine to 
warm up every time I stopped - eventhough I had only been in the store 
for 5 minutes. With heater boxes (heavy German boxes) the pipes didn't 
seem to cool down as quickly and the engine warmed up within 30 seconds 
or so.
