Well, finally I am off.
After the major panic of not being able to find my passport.  I now have my 
sh*t together and all is packed.
I will be taking my video/digital camera but not my laptop.
So expect a webpage to appear at the weekend of July 4th.
I leave Monday morning and stop in Washington Dulles, and then fly to 
Frankfurt arriving at 11:25 Am on June 15th.
Ihave reservations for Thurs/Fri and Sat at the Pension Haus Hildegard.

I hope to see all you Volks there and am looking forward to a great time.
