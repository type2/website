Well, Union, OR is the home of the WetWesties list...  There's an incredibly
active VW scene here in the PNW.  Bunches of shows and other events happening
almost weekly.  Many of them on the wet errr, west side of the mountains, but
only a few hours drive away.  Fer instance, Show/gathering of the faithful at
Hood River this weekend.

It's a little more 'redneck' than Monterey, but after a year or so, you get
used to it. (and Kennewick has one of the neatest  oriental restuarants that
I've ever eaten at! (Mongolian Barbeque, I think)  We drive up there (about a
hundred miles) four or five times a year just to eat there.)

Come on up!
