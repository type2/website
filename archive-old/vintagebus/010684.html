&lt;&lt; The 'whirring' sound  occurs when the bus is in neutral and the clutch 
pedal is out, but disappears when the clutch pedal is depressed. Is this 
consistent with 
 the throw-out bearing being offset? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Nope.  That would mean the sound is coming from you tranny input shaft 
bearings.  Meaning at best you need to check your tranny oil level, and fill 
if nessasary or it is time to start saving for a tranny rebuild.   Eric&amp;Barb
