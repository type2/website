&gt;OK.  The electrical socket with lighter for American automobiles are
&gt;about twice the diameter than the Euro ones.

Yep.  The Euro plug has about a 10mm diameter &quot;shank&quot; where the 
outside contacts are, and the center contact is about 5mm diameter
by 7mm long.  The total length that goes into the socket is only
about 20mm.  Many of the auto-electric gadgets I saw in Germany
came with one of these plugs, and a plastic sleeve (like a big
plastic bushing) to go over the narrow shank so it would plug
into a US-style socket -- the plastic bushing also had its own
outside contact to bring it out to the right diameter.

&gt;The early part of 1960s Westies had this Euro socket in the right 
&gt;rear closet above the door with a chromy flip cover for plugging 
&gt;in the Westie hanging lamp.  

This is how I recognized these when I saw them in Germany...somebody
on the list mentioned &quot;that funny little socket for the Westie
hanging lamp&quot;.  

&gt;Also if you look under the dash package tray in any 55 to 67 about 
&gt;two inches to either side of the heater tube there are two factory
&gt;holes for the Euro sockets for ambulance installation!

Cool!  I knew there was a reason I picked up two sockets and two
plugs when I was over there.  :)  The plug is held together by
a screw and bolt, and the socket body is threaded plastic with
a big nut that screws up from the back to hold it.  I'll have to
hook me up a socket in the '64 some day.  (These are generic
aftermarket Euro sockets, not VW ones).

When in Germany step into a &quot;Conrad&quot; store.  Conrad in Germany
is like what Radio Shack in the USA was 30 years ago...when they
were still interested in selling parts instead of cell phones.
They have all kinds of nifty electronic pieces parts...they were
even selling those VW-style &quot;Y&quot; connectors (three male prongs
with the clear plastic box covering) for $0.50 each or so.  Some
of the auto-electric stuff even has VW/Audi part numbers on it...
:)  I don't work for them, I just like their store.
