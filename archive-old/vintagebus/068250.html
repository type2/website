Subject: Castrol and BP

This may or may not be new information, but BP (British Petroleum) bought 
out Castrol.

I know in the past many people had concerns about Castrol because they were 
a branded middle man and actually did not produce any oil products.  Maybe 
under the new ownership this might change?

It was news to me and I just wanted to pass it on.

Take Care,
Adrian Pillow
