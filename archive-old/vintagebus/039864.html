Hey all,

All this talk about carbs prompts me to post the following question, I've 
got a 74 (#AK) DP 1600 with a adapter to fit a Solex 30/31 pict that I think 
is what the stock 1500 SP should have.  The carb is in great shape and seems 
to work well but is it choking my engine at all?  I'm fine with loosing a 
little power for better gas milage and frankly don't want throw down the 
bread for a new carb, however I don't want to be missing out on power I 
could have if my gas milage is not improved.  The bus has been down but as 
best as I can tell I'm getting about 20 mpg.  It seems pretty powerful but 
can be a dog in 4th on a small upgrade that I don't think should affect him 
at 50mph or better.  Thanks in advance...just thought I'd throw this out!
