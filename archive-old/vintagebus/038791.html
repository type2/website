Rented Pleasantville last night and they show a
very nice '58 or earlier single cabin in a side view,
with a TV repair ad/box on the back. Very late in
the movie it is seen again and heard driving off.
It even uses a correct sounding VW engine.

It is set in '58 and they made particular
efforts to be correct and it appears to be proper,
but the front isn't seen.  Don Knotts is driving,
whether that is good or bad is . . . . . .
