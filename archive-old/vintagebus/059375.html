Subject: Re: [VB] Red Barn / KelleyPark FYI

just down the street is the San Jose Fairgrounds......no idea what it costs 
to rent but its big......

the &quot;shine&quot;  of the cool backgrounds of old houses has lost out to the hassle 
of getting in......

I hate to try and make it smaller, I just think it needs a bigger place.....

but then you cannot call it Kelly Park !

no way to keep everyone happy........
