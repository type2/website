Subject: Door seals for dumkopfs

Ya...I probably spelled &quot;dumkopf&quot; wrong....figures!

I am asking if anyone has pics or a good site to go to that shows detail of
the placement, shape, and cuts on the front door seals (with the window
assemblies, if possible).  Ronnie at OldVolks has been way more supportive
and helpful than should be allowed, but I still feel a bit of trepidation
when approaching the front door seal process. (You will be getting another
call from me, Ronnie...)  I got the rear hatch, engine compartment, and
cargo door seals in...closing them in this cold is an adventure in
itself....

Pics would be great if you've got'em....

Oh yes....my latest page: www.sonic_dot_net/~mizamook/Interior1.htm is up and
running.  For those who spend two years and up on a bus, I apologize, but I
want to drive this thing someday!
