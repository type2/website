Subject: Re: Welding newbie has fun

From: VeeWee111_at_aol_dot_com

&gt;We had the same thing happen to us and it tore through on the freeway in LA 
&gt;rush hour traffic driving to Dizzyland or MGM Studios.  Barb suddenly had to 
&gt;shift without a clutch for the first time and did well!

I had the most amazing piece of luck when it happened to me.  I was turning into my driveway and pushed in the clutch to coast to a stop -- and 
that's when it tore thru.

BTW, the tranny and rgb's are back in place and I'm finishing up some final touches this weekend - hope to have the engine in and everything 
organized by Monday!
