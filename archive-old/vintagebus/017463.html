--- Ben Hawley &lt;ben.hawley_at_aquila_dot_com&gt; (probably
originally from Delaware) wrote:
Ar·i·zo·na (²r”¹-z½“n…) Abbr. AZ, Ariz.. A state of
the southwest United States on the Mexican border. It
was admitted as the 48th state in 1912. 
First explored by the Spanish in 1539, the area was
acquired by the United States in 1848 through the
Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Phoenix is the capital
and the largest city. Population, 3,677,985.
--Ar”i·zo“nan or Ar”i·zo“ni·an adj. &amp;  n. 
 Note: The above definition is from the American
Heritage Dictionary. Apparently they used the second
spelling of a descriptive term for someone from
Arizona.

Hahahaha...
Ah, F-orget that ;-) check the publishing location of
the Dictionary. It's probably from some BFE no-count
place like Delaware or New York. The dictionary staff
probably never got further West than Ohio. You can't
trust those shifty-eyed book wormy Waterpumper Vanagon
driving-Yanni listening types any ways. They were
probably frustrated impressionable insecure former
cheerleading wimmen folk who married myopic
Engineering students with personalities of a stale
peanut butter sandwich/buttermilk lunch- just with
intentions of glomming onto their paychecks and moving
to Greenwich, CT or out to Martha's Vineyard. I still
don't buy it...
Go ahead and use that term at will in Phoenix and most
everyone except the Johnny come lately dot com
Californians will be secretly be laughing at you and
forming the words &quot;Tourista Joto&quot; in the inner
sanctums of their minds.
Jim Ellis
Arizonan since 1956
