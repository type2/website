From my conversations with John concerning the hacked up, not worth a dime,
POS, he would surely like to thank the list for all there negative input on
a bus that will never amount to anything, Kudos' to you John, for following
through and finishing what in my opinion will be one of the KOOLEST KUSTOMS
out there. After seeing all the premiered lowered hacks out there it's nice
to see one done, maybe this will be incentive to all others to finish there
buses. If I had the $$$ I would definitely send my DC to him for paint, who
knows I might.

ronnie   if I was only so talented

ps. wait till you see the interior!!!
pps. it would take a lot more then the original $10,000 asking price to buy
it now!

Those shots are just teasers...you haven't seen the really cool stuff.  That
is one awesome ride.  Anyone want to make a bet as to if it makes the cover
of HVW's or not?

&gt; Oh my gawd, the purple primer theft mystery!!!
&gt; Wow! now you have to live with what looks like an
&gt; excellent project. Good for you. ;-)
&gt;
&gt; It's a darned good thing that I was one of the very
&gt; few who were *totally* in favor of the Double Door
&gt; Barndoor Deluxe Panel project. I'm all in favor of
&gt; customizing and doing it your way. F those vintage
&gt; nerds anyways! There is way too much of the cookie
&gt; cutter same old same old.
