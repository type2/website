Subject: trannys, rust and penetrants

ask any of the havasu connection i sell them and use rancho
transmissions myself
have never had a problem and sam the owner is a great guy. i sell the
rebuilt type 2 with a 3.88 r/p for 425.00 exchange or 475.00 outright
the cores have gone up these also have a 12 volt case so no grinding is
necessary.note; these do not come with a bus
nose cone(getting very hard to find)so you will need to use yours

to loosen up rusty nuts and bolts try PB BLASTER it's the best rust
stuff i've ever used
blows the doors off of wd40 etc. ask your local napa for it about 5.00 a
can.

to inhibit rust the 2 products i used for the last 15 years is rust mort
to convert scaly rust
available at most auto paint suppliers and to get rid of surface rust
and to protect the metal i use MIRACHEM 250 look up there web site at
mirachem_dot_com this is a water based organic product that is user friendly
and safe for the environment, this product has more then proven itself
to me after many years of resto's i still see some of my 10 year old
jobs and the protective coating is still there
.
