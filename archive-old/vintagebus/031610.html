I rode around in a double slider, 21 window delux at Bad Camberg and there
has been a DD delux at the last few Pomonas (with the correct middle seat)
and there's a DD Microbus here in Havasu (might see at BBB V) it might be
out of the body shop by then!

Did the factory make a Double Door (sets of doors on both sides of the bus)
23
Window?

or just in someone's hack dream?


Thanks
