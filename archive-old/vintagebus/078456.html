Subject: Re: [VB] 61 Splittie Front Floor Pan

eventually I'll have to do the same thing on my 61 deluxe, with original 
safaris.   40+ years of these  including decades in the PNW, have caused 
interesting rust patterns on the floor, beyond the normal patch areas.   I obtained a 
immaculate front floor for it from a junkyard, that will have to be removed 
from the chunk of bus around it before installing in the bus.    Plus I'll have 
to remove the steering column/hand brake handle, shift stick, etc from the bus 
from installing the floor piece.    I have collected most of the repair pieces 
I need for it, with the exception of the area behind the cargo doors. Anyone 
have one of those for a 61 (flat wheel arch, outie air vents)?

Depending how bad it is you may want to just patch it.

cause they sell only the patch panels at the edge, so look for junkyard buses 
or people w/ junk buses for the center area.

I've got a splittie that needs the whole front floor pan replaced. Anyone
had experience in replacing one? The damaged areas are too large to cut out
and weld in the repair plates you commonly see in catalogs. Any tips?
