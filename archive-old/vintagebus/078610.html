Subject: Fuel Injection Dealer Level Training Manual and help follow up.

Hi Volks- The result of my last endeavor at playing mechanic where my engine
would  lock up at 10 degrees before and 10 degrees was the result of a
broken valve which let go exactly when I turned the engine off for the last
time.  I didn't drop anything in the manifolds when I changed carbs. At
least that gives me a little more faith in my horrible mechanical
ability....

Anyway, I found a copy of V dealer training manual which gives a very basic
explanation of fuel injection and what each component and what it does. This
would be of great value to someone who wants a simplified explanation. If
someone would like to scan it and post it for all to evaluate, let me know
and I will send it to you. It is 8 pages size 5 1/2 inches by 8 1/4 inches.
Let me know. Ted
