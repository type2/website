I installed a WireWorks harness last summer in my '64 DC. A few tips... do it only if you need it. My nose had been crunched and all the front to back wires were pinched, badly repaired and in need of replacement. The whole nose was replaced, so all the wiring had to be disconnected.  Try to do it in one weekend, the same one that you disconnected everything in. My pull/install was separated by 18 months! The instructions will get you close to the correct wiring, it may be easier to follow the color schematic. My T/S and high beam indicators don't work and I followed the directions to the letter. I'll print a 3' wide printout of the schematic when I tackle that problem.
Cut the old harness in the middle, attach both ends to one pull string/rope and pull it from both ends, noting the route.
When you install the new harness, pull a length of trailer or Cat5 (stranded) cable AND another pull string for future guages, speakers, lights, smoke screen devices, etc. Avoid solid conductor phone or network wire, it'll flex and break. 
 With jackstands holding it up higher and a creeper underneath, it's more  guiding the harness than pulling it. I could pull with one hand and guide/push with the other. Didn't take long to feed from back to front. 
Clean all the contacts before you put the shiny new ones on. A bit of fine sandpaper works well. Don't push the contact on until you're sure it belongs there, Bob's brass connnectors have a barb so they're not easy to pull off. Make sure the fusebox is mounted securely before you hook up the battery!  
If you pull extra wires, install a terminal strip at both ends.
