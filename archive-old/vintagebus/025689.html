Doers anyone know where I can insure my bus using stated value
car insurance?
Thomas Burleson

I use Allstate to insure both my fully restored vw's.  I was able to
put  a stated value for my bus and bug.  Although my agent is a close
friend who is also into vw's, but I don't think that made much
difference.  You might have to get an appraisal.  I can't remember if I
had to or not.
