Hey List

Well, the Mango Warrior is runnin' great!  I've got all the transaxle
leaks under control.  It took me three days but i did a tune up etc...
and everything went great with compression at 118 all around but for #3
which was 125.  I figured my gas mileage is about 24 mpg (20 mpg US) but
I can't be sure because my tires are 65's? and i think i need 75's -
right?

I almost got all of my interior back in - but i still have to match the
z-bed fabric to the rest of my bus - hmmmmm.  Problem is my SO isn't so
crazy about caramel brown - I may have to recover both the front seat
and the z-bed in a fabric that matches my original interior yet is other
than caramel vinyl.

I am amazed that the 8-track thing works sooooooo well - wow, find it
for 5 bucks, it hasn't run in 20 years, replace a belt with an elastic
band, clean the heads - that's it - sounds great!  And hey - it'll never
be stolen (fingers crossed)  - yet they'll steal the crappiest cassette
deck around and smash out your windows to get it.  And if ya pay more
than 50 cents for a  cat stevens tape - ya got burned!  My greatest
8-track find may just be Bob Marley's &quot;Babylon By Bus.&quot;   Hmmm, what
does &quot;babylon&quot; symbolize and how do you spell it?

The ol' tin foil bubble stuff goes in easily enough - i stuck it to the
ceiling of my bus with duct tape folded back on itself and placed in
strategic locations - it's stickin' so far - i do have a hard time
believing that insulating  makes much sense but - smarter people
recommend it ..... so i do it.  Hopefully the plastic i put between the
foil and the straightened out panels will keep the panels straight -
we'll see.

The shag carpet is all back in :).  Actually, it is very nice stuff -
very close to mango green i'd say and it is a shortish shag, and 70's.
At first i had it carpet taped to a piece of panel board and glued on
the other side of the panel board was carpet underlay.  It was a square
the I could remove from my bus easily.  Some one else referred to using
glue and velcro to hold a carpet down - that may have worked really well
with the panel board/underlay method but i didn't try it - i just threw
away the panel board and underlay - and used duct tape/carpet  tape to
reinforce the edges of the carpet from underneath - i won't glue it
down. And i may just try the velcro thing.

My rear interior light has been operating on a very intermittent
manner.  It would probably come on 25% of the time.  I just soldered all
of the connections in it  after cleaning em and now ..... it works 100%
of the time.

I'll post some pics of Ulysses the Mango Warrior  as soon as the green
and white, polka dotted curtains are ready.
