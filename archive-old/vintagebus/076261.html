Subject: 15&quot; Rims

Hope y'all had a great Thanksgiving
I am trying to find one more 15&quot; Bus rims fro my son's 66 Splitty.
I found 3 awhile back put new clips on and had them powder-coated
White. The look good with the  chrome hubcaps.Several deals for the
fourth fell through as I had no more money at the time. Someone sent me a
link
to a vendor that had some. I have looked through the archives without any
success.
Musta been a private message.Any one out there know where I can buy 1 15&quot;
Bus rim?
Thanks
Tom
