Went to Oktoberbus this weekend.

Planned to buy a hitch from listee Chris (cybulski1_at_email.msn_dot_com) but would
not fit, as his is a 72 and mine is a 71. Too wide. Anyway, the design is
perfect. Uses the same holes as the rear bumper mounts (no drilling), attaches
to a round bar that hides behind the bumper, then curves around the bumper to
the ball. NO holes in the bumper! Anyone got one like it for a 68-71??

BTW, Chris is &quot;Mr. What a Guy&quot;, and has a beautiful family. Sorry it did not
work out.

Had to leave in the middle of the event to go to my the kid's homcoming
football game. Tootsie was to be crowned the homecoming queen. Thrashed the
clutch cable on the way home, so a 2 hour trip turned into a 5 hour trip and
barely made it there on time. Carry a spare. I drug the new pull-behind camper
I bought for the bus behind the f**d to get back late Saturday night. It was a
hit. Built for a motorcycle, it is very light and sleeps 3 to 4 kids. :-)

Saw many listees, to tired to write a report. Was a great bus event. Someone
write a report! Maybe Marv, as he bought a crewcab on the way to the event.

Peace,

Ric
