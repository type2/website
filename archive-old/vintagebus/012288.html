Everett,

I can trace mine for you.  I actually have two ;0)  The felt runs along the
bottom to stop vibrations.  Mine didn't have any on the top but I bet there
is suppose to be some.  The divider is slid into the runners on the side
and the top and is bolted to the divider behind the seat by 5 10mm bolts
(if I remember correctly.  Hope this helps.

Joy thru air,

Jamie
