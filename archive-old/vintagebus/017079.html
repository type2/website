My '55 westy is the *exact* same way.   And my '60 DD has the vestigial
holes on *both* sides, both on the cargo door closest to the back of the bus,
which means you should probably weld yours up and cover the inside of the bus 
with shag carpet samples so nobody will notice.  

I guess they only put straps to keep you from whacking the front door with
the cargo door.

I have 2 NOS cargo door holders, the ones they used on emergency vehicles,
and have been wondering what to do with them.  I'm thinking of mounting
one on each side, on the &quot;top&quot; door.  Either that or install them both
on one side, which is correct, and then wait around for another set.

Opinions?  

notice.
