&lt;&lt; Guess what? Got the old cable out and finally fished the new cable through
 that little grommet. Then I found out that the square hole in the grease cap
 was rounded so I had to braze it smaller and then file to fit. After all 
that,
 the new cable from Bus Boys doesn't come with an E clip so it just sat there
 in the hole. Didn't matter anyway. After I started down the road the spedo
 wasn't turning anyway, broken spedo. Oh well. Wanted to find out what my
 average speed was to Everett everyday from Kent east hill. Oh well, I keep up
 with traffic.
 
 Ray lookin for a spedo
  &gt;&gt;
did the speedo break or did the end of the cable fall through the square 
hole?  It has to have a clip or cotter pin or something to hold it.

If you dont have an E clip you can wrap some thin wire around th dimple in 
the cable endto hold it from falling through the dust cover.
