Subject: RE: [VB] How To Tell Original Hubcaps?

  OE Vdub in Colorado has NEW genuine VW (domed) hubcaps. On the early
original ones they were 2 piece. I do not know what year this changed to the
one piece. I have both styles and cases of hubcaps and have yet to sort them
out to see. It seems that on old (OG) ones I have the chrome will polish out
real nice and will not be as pitted from rust as old repos. 
  Maybe a good BBB game pick out the og hubcap contest `

&gt; Would like to hear your input and yes am always interested in buying good
&gt; used *original* hubcaps.

Hi Michael,
That is a bit like asking how to tell the differance between gold and fools 
gold without any scientific instruments/tools on hand!  ;-)  The OG ones are

heavier due to being made of thicker steel and the VW emblem is deeper 
pressed and sharper than any repros.  Have seen ones made a few years back 
from Brazil probably manufactured with the original German tooling that were

exactly the same as OG, but had fine wire wheel patterns showing through the

otherwise really nice chroming.  They were about $40.00 each back then 
through Wolfburg Warehouse so you might check with Bill there to see if he 
still can get those.
