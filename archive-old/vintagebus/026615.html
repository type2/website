On a serious note, people who have painted busses chime in.  Paint a two tone
with or with out front doors for best results??   Why did they extend the
chestnut brown down into the wax red that far?  Obviously were going to e-shoot
the red I guess.  Is it easier to over shoot the top color and then come back
and fineline tape the swage line??

I'll ask the board over at Autobodystore_dot_com too, but just thought I'd ask here
too.

Thanks


Steve
