Subject: RE: [VB] Warning

I did this too, reversed an ATM card charge through a dispute by my bank.
For nondelivery, you should be able to accomplish this.



#I too used my atm card and got taken for $1114.00 using Paypal.  I talked
to my bank.  They reversed the electronic transfer!!  I got my money back,
and I never thought I would.  Talk to your #bank, you may get a pleasant
surprise. One note, it has to be done within 60 days of the transaction.#
