I can hardly believe all the really cool fun posts I've received in less
time than it took me to print my orig. post about eBay items :)
So because of a change of heart...I will offer BOTH items, yes I said both
items here on the list first.
I want $500 for the rack
I want $500 for the tent  (incl. orig. bag too)
Is everybody happy now?
