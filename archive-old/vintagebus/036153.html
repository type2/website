oh, I thought everything was groovy.  I set off with a smile on my face this
morning.  Well, maybe not, the power was out so I had no coffee (the more it
rains the more I drink coffee, and the rivers are near flood level the last
day or so), a 60ft cedar fell over last night (luckily not on the house, but I
think the garden is a little worse for it), and the neighbors are jerks.  Any
way, I did set off, in my 65 westy with its no longer rythmically clunking
transaxle, and at a certain point I arrived at Les Shwab to get my tire (going
flat) fixed.    They found a screw in it (my tire was screwed), fixed it and
sent me on my merry way.

At this point the universe decided it was time to flip me the bird.  Well, why
not?

The bus don't start.  dash  lights dim.   Check headlights- none!    Check
battery terminal- its fine.   Wigggle wire on starter- now the lights are on,
wiggle various wires, and finally get a push start.     

At home in the garage I found the rain was so hard it was coming under the
garage door and invading my personal space.    

I tested volts in various places- ig switch, starter terminal, battery, etc
etc and found them all appropriate.  Do the screwdirver thing and it clicks
pitifully, pull the starter lying in the puddle on the floor, test it in a bit
of tranny bell housing, and it murrrrs like it can't quite belch.    Hunt up
the receipt w/forever warranty (2 years old!?!), the old starter I had never
returned as a core, and got a ride to Schmuck's (in a big#ss 4x4 chevy
cruising through the flooded corner by the seasonal lake), who merrily gave me
a nother rebuildt starter and some cash for the core.

bench test the starter- it vrooms, and put that bad boy in the bus.  Now it
clicks.   Electrics are imploding.    Run a jump wire from the starter and to
the battery- no vroom.    End up pulling the motor just for the halibut, and
start pulling the starter, the wire to the ig switch touchs something and
sparks.  WHat!  That is  wierd, it shoul not be hot.   must be a short.  Now
with the wire to the front wrapped up in electrical tape and separate from the
starter, the jump wire works.   Okay- now I will temporarily start it with a
jump wire to the battery.  Motor in and hooked up, I wander round the garage
late at night bumping ino things.   I can't decide if I am religious and god
thinks I am a target, or it's a punishment for something horrible I have done,
perhaps in a past life,    aethiest and consider this random chance.  Maybe I
am a scientist and there is a physical reason and a mechanism to explain it.
Maybe I believe in the stars and didn't reallise my horoscope says don't touch
metal this month.    How abou NewAgey and it is happening to teach me
something that will help me on my path to spiritual enlightenment.   Geeses.
Time to investigate my pile of old VW wire to prepare to get it sorted out.

Maybe my bus really wanted to keep the old garbagey noisey popping out of
reverse tranny, and is mad at me, and we should have a good heart to heart
talk about  letting go.  Think I should think more about that, and go stark
raving mad.   This is Friday, isn't it?  Sort of?   Okay- you guys set up a
betting pool on what will go wrong next.    As it works me like an unwanted
redheaded stepchild.     If anyone is actually reading this drivel.  

Clara
