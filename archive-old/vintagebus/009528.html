Shawn Hunt from Ottumwa, IA was one of the cool Midwestern listees I met at
BNNTA this year in person.  Enroute he accidentally left his gas cap as a
filling station.  It was an original one too!  DOH!   Anyway, I made him a
make shift gas cap out of rag, aersol can cap, and hose clamp.  Well I got
this message from Shawn a few days later:

&gt; Erin........Hey is there any reason I can't use an oil filler cap as a
&gt; gas cap? It fits fine.......I was just wondering

So there you go - you can use an oil filler cap as a gas cap and I wouldn't
be surprised if it worked just as good the other way around...
