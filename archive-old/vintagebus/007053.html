Before I start a few disclaimers. I am not assoc. with John and
Aircooled_dot_net and as most of you know I don't  own a tack, timing light,
dwell meter,  gauges, ect. I do have a static light though and use it alot.
 My engine is a 1776, d/p, 110 cam, mild head work, balanced counter
weighted crank,rods, pistons, ect. pict 34 carb.
 I read the artical in VW Trends a month ago and ordered the SVAD that
replaces the 009. Recieved it in a couple weeks and it sat for another
couple weeks. Installed it the day before we left for KP. Static set timing
and it fired right up. Forgot to check the point gap, assume it was 016.
Drove the bus to work Wed morning and ran it up the hill home. The hill is a
very long slow grade that alot of VW's can't pull in 4th. I advance my
timing till it pings and back it off  and run up the hill a couple times and
set it there. I know this is crazy to a bunch of you and we have been there,
but it has worked for me for over 30 years and 100's of thousands of miles.
Anyway the flat spot on accel. was gone and the bus seemed to run good.
 We left LHC around 5PM Thurs in 100 degree heat. There are 2 big long hills
heading to I40 and the bus ran good up the 1st and pinged a little up the
2nd. Stopped and retarded a little and topped the hill at 55 and headed to
I40. I need to say that my bus was fully loaded inside, full roof rack, and
towing the single wheel trailor full of swap stuff, so had a big load.
 Got to Needles and headed up the 13 mile climb on I40 heading to Barstow.
Bus ran bad up the hill,  no power when I gased it,stopped twice to check
things, all looked good, did the spit on the case and grab the dip stick to
check temp, kept going. Got to top and headed down the next hill and the
next and into Barstow. Bus ran good through the gears but had no top speed.
Think my motor was not putting out enought vacuum to pull advance all the
way.
 Gased in Barstow and got 20.5 MPG, about the same as with the 009.
 Muffler flange broke off out of Barstow and ran over Tehachapi pass and
into Bakersfield without mufflers. Still good at low speeds and not top
speed. Pissed off because Ronnie could out run me. Gased in Bakersfield and
got around 20.5 again.
 Found a VW shop and bought a single muffler header kit and installed it and
pulled the SVAD and put the 009 back in. I had always run a dual muffler
exhaust before this. The single muff was new to me.
 Fired the motor and headed for Pasa Robles on hwy 46. Stopped once to tweek
the timing and hauled ass. I could now run 65 MPH and kick butt on Ronnie.
 Gased in Salinas and got 23 MPG and we ran 65 the whole 200 plus miles.
 Never got worse than 22.5 and got 23.5 once the rest of the trip running 65
MPH.
  I think the problem is with my modified engine. After doing more reading
it looks like this dist. is for stock motors. The only thing I can trace the
extra MPG to is the single muffler and more back pressure.
  Met up with Dave Barnes ( Everrtts brother) at KP and he wanted to know
how the SVAD had run. Told him and decided to give the SVAD to him to test
as he has a bone stock 1600 d/p with a stock pict 34. Mine has modified jets
and tube. Dave will give it the true test that it should get and report back
to the list.
 Sorry for the not to good results, but i am sure it was because of my
modifications. Dave will give it the true test.
 As I said the SVAD worked great at lower rpm and it did eliminate the 009
flat spot all together. Can't wait to here how it works in Daves deluxe.
 I don't think this was a true test for this SVAD and sure it will work
great on a stock engine.
 The biggest thing I learned was how much better the engine ran with a
single exhaust. It got me a 2 to 3 MPG gain as I have been getting around 20
MPG for the last 5000 miles on this engine.
  I think it will get me 25/26 on the trip to Carlsbad the end of the month.
Will be running with no load.
 All for now as we need to wait for Daves report.


 Keep driving your buses ( Ronnie and I drove 1260 miles in the 4 days we
were on the road to KP and back )
