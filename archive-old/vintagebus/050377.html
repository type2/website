&gt;our bus is a 60 right?   the air cleaner hangs to the lefts side of the
&gt;engine compartment and you want the triangle bracket that attach with the
&gt;coil attachment bolts.

Unless you have an Eberspacher heater in which case the air filter 
hangs to the right, and the corresponding bracket setup on that side 
as well. This also involves using a much longer paper hose  from the 
air filter breather to the heat exchanger
