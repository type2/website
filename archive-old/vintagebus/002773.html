I'm in Dallas and there is a company that advertises in the Dallas Morning
News under the &quot;Antique Autos&quot; in the classified ads. I don't know if it is
the same company or not.

When I did it I paid an outfit $200 for the weekend to rent a really big ass
trailer unit (you need at least a 1/2 ton tow vehicle). It is a diesel unit
to power a giant compressor that you dump $35 bags of baking soda. You have
to wear ear protection and a respirator. You hold a nozzle as big as a
firehose about a foot away from the work and BLAST AWAY. It cuts an area
about 8-10&quot; swath. It cuts bondo, rust and paint, but is cool, no heat to
warp the metal and takes it right down to the steel. It will not hurt glass,
chrome or rubber. If you are doing it at home the dust can be a problem, so
they give you a little thing that attaches to the nozzle and dribbles water
from your garden hose. It works just as good but makes &quot;baking soda mud&quot;. It
will not kill the grass at all. It actually adds some ph to the soil.

The two biggest drawbacks are it took 12 bags of soda at $35 each to blast
the bus inside and out. And if you use the water to hold down the dust it
leaves soda mud in the tiniest crevices. It will dissolve when hit with
ordinary vinegar, but it has to be found and removed.

It would be best for a company to provide booths where you could bring in
your work and do it there. It is a little intense for the neighbors.
