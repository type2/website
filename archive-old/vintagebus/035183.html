Subject: RE:  flame from listee

This is a little crazy for just being vocal on a VW mailing list.

Who really cares if the bus owners are hippies or not these days?  We
utilize this list for fun, information, and friendship.  What I consider
part of the vintage bus ownership experience.  Maybe I am naive to think
this way?

Personally I am very fiscally conservative with an overall libertarian view.
I also support social freedoms, but do not agree with most of the
activities.  Basically you should have the freedom of choices, although some
are much more correct than others :)  The only thing I do not like at all is
abortion, adoption is an alternative.  Oh yah I also support all the items
in the Bill of Rights, including the 2nd amendment.

Does the above description make me a hippie?  I do not know.  Does it
matter... No.

I like vintage nazi busses for some reasons and I like the hippie Discover
card style busses too... Yah, even the Cal Look busses.  It is one big happy
family :)
    
To summarize... BE KIND!...  Now I have to get back to working hard to
support the millions of people on Welfare with nicer TVs than me!
