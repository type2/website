Subject: OG windshield seals/rear hatch

HELP ME, I need an original German windshield seal to copy. The seal will be
returned along with a set of NEW GERMAN seals that we are trying to have
made. These seals will be formed (molded) for the left and right sides. The
reason I need an OG one is so the profile can be copied exactly. Any help
would be appreciated.  We are also going to do 1 piece engine lid seals for
67 and earlier buses. Also, for those with 64-67 buses watch for a good deal
soon on the rear hatch seal (GERMAN), a price to low to quote, I will have
these here hopefully by the classic weekend.

thank-you
