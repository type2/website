Subject: RE: [VB] Copper or steel brakelines?

&gt; I've never heard of a modern car having brake lines made of copper!
&gt; Perhaps some antiques.  Copper tends to work-harden with vibration rather
&gt; quickly, so I'd not want to use it.  Stick with steel with an appropriate
&gt; anti-corrosion coating if you are worried about rust.

Thinking about nor have I.  I think the copper lines are just manufactured
by someeone after a quick buck - they are about 20% cheaper than steel lines
and advertised as being corrosion proof.

Thanks
Paul
