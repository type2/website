Subject: RE: [VB] &quot;Slightly Custom&quot;

The reason I have my daily driver SC is because it's the only one around in my
personal travels. It's unique, it's different, and it's me. Vintage dubs
aren't run of the mill look alike that you see everyday and I for one own one
for that reason. It was the same reason I had the ramp side Corvair truck and
the front opening Isetta, or my VolksAir compressor. Except for the purest
among us, unique is unigue.

While it's pushing it a tad, I still think this bus &quot;looks&quot; mildly
custom. The roof is what pushes it for me. But the overall feel of
the bus is mild custom in my opinion. Obviously people will disagree
and I don't want to argue about it, but just wanted to chime in.

I think this is a fine looking bus and would easily be worth the
money for someone looking for something like that. I do agree that
making a custom bus for profit is harder to sell than a stock one.
And many times don't fetch the same price. But I don't think this one
is too far off for what it is. It's a nice bus. With very fine
workmanship.

My opinion for the record.
