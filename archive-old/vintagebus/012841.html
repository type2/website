&gt;&gt;What's the original of the term &quot;church key&quot; anyway?

&gt;&gt;Any info is welcome,

When I was a kid in the 50s &amp; 60s, beer cans were made from fairly
tough steel, and required the kind of opener that punches a small
triangular hole in the top of the can.  Same kind of opener that's
used for large juice cans today.

People called this type of metal opener a &quot;church key&quot;, as a kind of
irreverent slang.  I think that this is probably the origin of the
term being used for the tapered keys that fit in the square holes of
engine lids &amp; gas tank flaps on splittys.

Bill

P.S. --- Those old steel cans were _really_ tough, not at all like the
         flimsy aluminum ones today . . . anyone who could crush a
         beer can with one hand was *strong*!  (non-VW, but it's Friday)
