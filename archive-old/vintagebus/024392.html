Subject: sandblast a bus?

Since a '67 Westy I'm hoping to buy will need paint, what are your thoughts
on prepping for repaint? The original paint is quite faded, but the bus is
totally rust-free and dent-free. I want the flat side panels to be as clean
as possible. My paint shop recommends sandblasting, but I'm nervous about
warping the panels due to the heat of blasting. Is it best to sand the
original finish and apply the new paint over that? Another concern is
excessive paint thickness...  Thanks in advance for your advice!

Regards,
Kris Trexler
