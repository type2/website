&gt; I'm a firm advocate/believer in SS brake lines to replace the OEM
rubber
&gt; lines that often cause problems with age.  Rob Kuhn of the VintagVW
list
&gt; kind of got me turned on to them and I'll never go back to the OEM
ones.

Stainless steel brake lines consist of a stainless steel braided
sheath with a (usually) teflon liner.  The teflon contains the brake
fluid, and the steel protects the teflon.  The lines last as long as
the teflon liner, but there is no way to observe the condition of the
teflon liner until it fails.

The really bad news is that most (not all) of these lines are not DOT
approved for street use.  Most of the manufacturers of these lines are
not anxious to get approval, since the &quot;off-road use only&quot; label on
the packaging shields them from a lot of liability if their product
fails in service.

Picture this:  The stainless steel line fails and you t-bone another
car.  Naturally, they sue you (I'm speaking of the US here, of
course). Normally, your insurance company would take up your defense,
as it it their money at stake.  They send an investigator out to
inspect the wreckage.  They see the shiny stainless brake lines that
you installed and note that they don't have the &quot;DOT&quot; marking that
brake lines are supposed to have.  They then send you a letter quoting
an obscure paragraph in your policy that says that such mods are a
no-no and that your policy is voided.  You're left swinging in the
breeze.

Except in cases of extreme age, I've never heard of a rubber brake
line failing.  I have, however, heard of stainless steel brake lines
being blocked or leaking right out of the box due to poor quality
control.  Just because it is made of a &quot;trick&quot; material doesn't mean
that the part is good.

I wouldn't be in a hurry to put stainless lines on my bus.
