i tried that plasti-dip stuff...not too impressed with it. sometime in the
near future i will try that inner tube solution...or i have heard some have
been successful with sticky back felt.

the plasti-dip stuff seems to &quot;creep&quot; over time, eventually becoming pretty
thin wher you need it most.

as for the rack feet themselves, i have been using some plastic tubing, you
could probably use that or maybe fuel line for something softer.
