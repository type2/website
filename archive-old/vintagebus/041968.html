Woah!  I didn't say that!  My dividing line was the change from rear
engine/rear drive toi front engine/front drive!  Type 3's are vintage VWs
from a mechanical standpoint.

I don't want to make it watercooling either, since there are those
wasserboxer vanagons that are rear engined in the traditional VW format.
