Subject: Front Disc Brake Kit Grease Seals - Unable to Locate

Dear List:

I need your help findingthe proper inner grease seals for the aftermarket 
front disc brake setup on my bus.  A year or so ago I purchased one of those 
German-made front disc brake conversion kits for a 1968 Bus front beam 
(which is attached to my 66 Samba).  I have recently had to do some work on 
this brake system which required me to remove the front inner grease seals 
in the rotors.  I beat up the seals pretty badly and need to replace them, 
but the stock grease seals for a '68 bus do not fit in these rotors.  The 
size of the grease seals in the disc brake kit were 45 x 62 x 8A, which are 
smaller than the stock seals, which I believe are 50 x 64 x 8.

Can you please help me find the correct grease seals for this brake kit?

Sincerely,

Richard Blake
