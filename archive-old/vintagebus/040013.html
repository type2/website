Hello all,

I was wondering if anyone here might have the pedestal for the rear seat of 
my doublecab.  Well, at least it's worth a try to ask.  I saw the one on 
dropgates_dot_com, but I can't spend $500, and anyways, I don't need any of the 
seats themselves.  Even if you have a rusty one you want to sell.......


Thanks,

Alex
