&gt; Could you tell why after you got the old one out?  Rust/corrosion in the
&gt; bushings, or the one in there was never reamed out right, or...?  Just
&gt; curious.

The old bushing was pretty corroded and nasty on the bottom; you can
see that in one of the pix. I initially suspected that someone pounded 
in the bushing without reaming it, but there was no evidence of 
pounding on the pin.
