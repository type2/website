I posted the link cause I was asked to pass it along.
Personally I think its a  bit pricey but to each his own. The guy selling it
is Moe at &quot;transporter garden&quot; in cali. He prolly has alot of parts for it
due to that being his business, but I doubt he took stuff off it before the
selling commenced. never know though. Im sure the price is aimed at the
foreign/rusty market and thats why it hasn't been snapped up by the locals
