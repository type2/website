I agree the above info. Re: the book is very helpful....but....
how much does it weigh, what color is it, and what size print is used and
very importantly what size lettering is used???
:)
Almost sounds like one of those law library deals...16th volume,
unabridged version, ch. 12, sub text 15-a, para 21.7, sec. 1-A in the
re-printed version under title of unknown origin, beginning with
unadulterated headers, footers, and hooters...hooters?
Get me outta here.....
later
