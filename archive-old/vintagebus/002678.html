&gt; &gt; 'Roo Bars - an interesting read even if you don't live side-by-side with
&gt; some of
&gt; &gt; the most exotic animals in the world.

&gt;
&gt; Those of us in the mid-west need those for the deer around here!

Now I'm adding: (because it's friday).

Amen to the &quot;Deer Bars&quot; and add to that, the need for &quot;Raccoon Scoops&quot;
to clean off the heaps of dead coons that would cripple any lowered
midwestern bus.
Raccoons have to be the most ill-equipped animals to ever live near roads.
It's not uncommon to run over two or three at a time even after trying every
evasive maneuver possible to avoid them. They just seem to have a
death-wish.
