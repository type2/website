&gt; ok, if my bus was actually here w/ me, i could check
&gt; this...  (long story!)  i was wondering if the hook
&gt; that holds the front cargo door strap would double for
&gt; the hook that holds the child's cot bar in a so-23?
&gt; the photos i've got LOOK pretty close...  *grins*
&gt;

*very* close, but not exactly. When I got an SO-23 in parts I tried that
and was scolded by my &quot;Westy&quot; friends. I'm sure it would work, but it's
not the same.
