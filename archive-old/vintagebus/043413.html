&gt;My hazard lights dont come on with my 67 westy. The swith light turns on
&gt;but thats all. Should the switch blink on and off? Isit the switch?  or
&gt;the hazard relay, or the dreaded black box?

The light in the switch should blink - it should be on when the turn
signal lights on the front of the Bus are on, and off when the turn
signal lights are off.

There are two wires from the nine prong box to the hazard light switch.
The blue one is the wire for the light in the switch.  The brown one
is grounded by the switch to start the hazard flashers working.

A simple test would be to pull the brown wire off of the hazard
switch and ground it to the vehicle body.  If the hazards start working,
your hazard switch is not working right.  If they don't work, trace
that brown wire to the nine-prong box, &quot;S&quot; terminal.  Use another
piece of wire to jump the &quot;S&quot; terminal to ground.  If your hazards
work then, then the brown wire between the box and the switch is
open.  If they still don't work, the trouble is probably inside the
box.

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
