Subject: Re: [VB] want to undercoat my bus for winter

&gt; undercoat my bus and just apply it with a big paint brush to prevent my
bus from rusting.
------------------
There are some really good roof patching polymer compounds. I'd just warn
you that they are gooey nasty things to work with overhead. They can be
thinned and sprayed.
