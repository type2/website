as for the brakes.... they still work...  just a shutter in the truck when 
applyed... it still tracks straight.
Hi Dave,
Sounds like in your panic the brake drums were turned from round into slight 
ovals.  We have been able to fix this with gentle braking for several weeks 
afterwards.  One can have the drums turned, but there is very little material in 
VW drums in comparison to most USA auto brake drums, and since quality made 
repro drums for buses are nearly impossible to find....
  We have heard the same problem happens to truckers after a long downhill if 
they put on the E-brakes at the bottom of the hill the drums cool into an 
oval!
