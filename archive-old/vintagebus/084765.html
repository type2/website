WESTIES AT WATKINS IV

http://www.limbobus_dot_org/watkins05.htm


We are doing it again this year for the fourth year in a row.  One more
campout before it gets too cold.  Plan to come and join other van owners
for a campout at Watkins Glen State Park NY, Friday September 30th and
Saturday Oct. 1 2005. The State Park is easily accessible from Highway
14 in the town of Watkins Glen NY.  This is part of New York's natural
wonders, the Gorge and the Finger Lakes. 

Any VW van models (not just Westfalias) are welcome to come and
participate in this event. For a unique (&amp; strictly optional) treat on
Sunday Oct. 2nd, in association with the Finger Lakes Region VW Club
www.flrvwc_dot_com we  will  get to drive our vans on the Watkins Glen
International Race Course.  What a hoot!  We have pictures from previous
years to prove it.

Friday activities will focus on finding our camp sites and getting
acquainted. 

Saturday we will plan on taking a hike and discovering Watkins Glen
State Park in its full beauty of the glacier-carved  mile-long gorge. It
has rained in the past 3 years and we still enjoy this hike, but bring
rain gear.  In the afternoon, we can relax at the campsite, drive around
the area, and go wine tasting at the many wineries along Seneca Lake and
other adjacent Finger Lakes. At night time, the park rangers will
probably entertain us with some campground activity and we can retire
swapping tall VW tales and be entertained with some live music around
the campfire.  In past years we all enjoyed some cool door prizes
donated by some of the Vanagon List Vendors. Let's hope they come
through again this year to continue with this tradition. 
As an option for Saturday, the Corning Glass Museum is just down the
road in the town of Corning and well worth the visit.  Plan on spending
a good part of the day there.

SUNDAY: Events will be a to pack up and caravan to the racetrack about 5
miles away (up hill) and join up with FLRVWC members caravaning down
from Rochester along with other VW club members from Syracuse and
Buffalo in their VW cars. We will then be led onto the racetrack for
pictures and do laps for about an hour before enjoying lunch.  Lunch in
the track club house is optional.

This is optional but if you would like to participate in the racetrack
events, and drive your VW van on the track, YOU MUST PRE-REGISTER and
pre-pay - No Day of Event registration will be allowed.  If you want
lunch at the club house you must also prepay and let the cook how many
people will be eating.  (Contact me for the lunch fees - not known as of
8/25)

CAMPING INFORMATION
We are trying to stay as a group in the large loop area called TUSCARORA
VILLAGE or Area F at the Watkins Glen State Park.

This campground loop does not have electricity at the sites.  If you
need electricity in your van, then the only camping area at WGSP with
electricity is in the Mohawk Village loop.  The bathroom in Area F is
located in the center of the big grass area and was all ours last year.
It has nice showers, warm with electricity and clean facilities.

The campground is open for reservations via the web or you can also pay
when you show up.  The problem is finding a site in our group area if
you do not reserve and book online.  Last year I was able to secure the
entire loop for us because this portion had been closed but this year
the park is keeping all the loops open until Columbus Day weekend, so
everything is fair game.

They allow 2 vehicles per site for the same price.

Go to the following web site:

http://www.reserveamerica_dot_com/jsp/commonpage.jsp?goto=/usa/ny/watk/newin
dex.html


Select the TUSCARORA VILLAGE link to see the campsites available.  We
will try to stay on the east side of this loop so from sites 280 to 305.

I have booked my selected site number: 289 in Loop F.  This is where
Frank Condelli draped the Canadian flag last year.

Fees for 2 nights  
Rate: Family   
Camping Fee: $40.00   
Reservation Fee: $9.00   
Total Fee: $49.00
