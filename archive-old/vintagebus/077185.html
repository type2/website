Subject: anyone trtaveling from delaware to MA

Hi guys,

I just saw a great looking roof rack on the samba for my VW, unfortunately
it is in Delmar, MD and I am in Boston...the guy selling it estimates $130
for shipping...not really worth it at that price. SO I was wondering if
anyone is planning any trips in that direction in the near future, and if
they would be willing to carry that along? I would greatly appreciate it and
would be happy to help pay associated gas or oil or beer costs...

thanks
