So no noise when the engine is on but not rolling.  So does it make the sound 
when rolling and no motor?  What part of the bus is whupping?  The left rear? 
Then again, jack up the rear of the bus so your wheel are off the ground 
(please block the front wheels, and have the parking brake off)  and start 
the engine, put it is first and let out the clutch,  The rear wheels should 
now spin.  Any funny noises?   get out and watch-  anything wierd happening?  
  You can also do this with just jacking up the left rear wheel, and just 
that one will spin, unless you have an M 220 (limited slip) tranny.

I wouldn't drive with scary noises.

&lt;&lt; Hmm, what's that sound?
 
 I was driving the 66 at city speeds, everything was dinw, and then &quot;Bang!&quot;
 from the back end, followed by an ominous whuppa-whuppa-whuppa noise.
 Intrigued and terrified and thinking perhaps I'd blown a tyre, I pulled
 over. Everything looked normal.  Start it up, get on my way, and still
 'whuppa-whuppa-whuppa' (I think the 'bang' part was an overture to the
 'whuppas')  I can't figure this one out.  It *sounds* like it's coming from
 the DS rear.  It's not an engine thing (near as I can tell) becasue the
 noise doesn't occur when idling or revving the engine.  Im pretty sure it's
 not a clutch thing, because the cluth catches great, as usual, and all the
 gears engage fine.  I pulled rear drums, and the brakes are fine.  Which
 leaves the question of tranny trouble, BUT: all gears, incl. reverse
 function fine, the van pulls fine, everything is normal but for this noise.
 It seems to clatter a bit more when I put the clutch in whilst driving, but
 this may sound different because the engine's quieter.  Also, the frequency
 of the clattering increases with speed.  There is no tranny fluid leaking, 
BTW.
 
 I have a 66 bus with a DP 1600.  Axle bolts are 36mm, which means it's from
 an earlier vehicle (right?).
 
 Any ideas?  Should I be driving the bus?  The nearest shop I trust for
 diagnosis of this is 60km away in another city, but I'm not too keen to have
 it out even on the back roads.  I would like to get this fixed so I can
 enjoy my bus for what's left of this dismal summer. &gt;&gt;
