Hey all,

Just wanted to add my 2cents on the fire truck being sold by the illustrious
Mr.. Zscoche (or &quot;Princess&quot; as we call him  lol inside joke there).

Last I talked to Kent, he was asking 5,000 for the bus with no engine.
After the engine and brake work, he'll probably be up to around 8,000.

I'm not knocking the bus or anything here....  I've seen it, felt it, smelt
it, sat in it and got a big 'ol woody from it.  Nearly creamed myself
playing with the lights and sirens...   It's a very solid bus, lots of goofy
fire-truck things...  belly pans, high-roof torsion bars, tow hooks, SOLID
bumpers.. this thing is the monster truck of busses.
The fact of the matter here, though is that as it sits it's pretty much just
a red panel.  All of the fire equipment is missing...  hoses, racks, etc. So
anyone considering this bus should keep that in mind.
The sliding door works PERFECTLY though.  It is dented, but not as bad as
Kent will probably lead you to believe.  The nose is perfect, and very
little rust throughout.  The button on the rear hatch doesn't have a lock...
nifty fire-truck thing there...  there is a factory installed bug dome light
over the rear hatch area thats pretty kewl.
So anyway, thats my take on the thing.. to me, I wouldn't even give 5 for it
if were running and driving... if it were TOTALLY complete, that might be
another story...

But thats just my opinion folks...  I'm not trying to bust kents chops here,
he's a good friend of mine, I'm just offering an impartial opinion on the
subject.   I'm sure if you call/e-mail Kent he'll give you the skinny on it.

What to say to somebody who doesn't appreciate your Vintage VW: &quot;In ten
years
my car will still be a classic, your will just be OLD.&quot;

Protect me from the things I want.    Leave now, sleep when you get there.
