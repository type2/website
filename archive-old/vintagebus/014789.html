Hey Again,
I recently picked up three dual port 1600 engines.  One is totally stuck, 
one sticks halfway through the revolution and the other turns freely.  What 
do I need to do to prevent further damage to the freed up one and what can 
be done for the others.  I want to store them for future use.

Thanks,
Boyd Smith
