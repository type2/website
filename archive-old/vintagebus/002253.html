Hey fellow busers:

I just got ahold of 20 pair of front lenses 1962-67

They are beautiful from 10 feeet away, very small flaws if you are picking
them apart.

I showed the mfg a minor defect (that I fixed with a sanding block)

Other than that, they are cheap and they do go on and look good.

I can sell them for $18 ea to the list.

Gimme a holler if I can help.

See you in Pomona Sunday.
