I'm hungry, but I can't be bothered with the expense of food...

Do you have any idea how much a gas heater weighs?  Probably less than
the extra heater-core thingy, plus all the tubing, extra oil, etc.

Unless you have some sort of super-duper racing buggy, where weight is
an absolute premium, just go with the gas heater.  Or, go back to heater
boxes and a less radical exhaust.

Then again, may this message would have been better suited if it had only been
posted to vintagvw, and not x-posted to vintagebus.
