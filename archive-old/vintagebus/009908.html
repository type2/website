Subject: Sandblasting a panel?
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

After calling all around AZ to various sandblasters, i am unable to locate
anyone who will do walnut blasting which i was told by many , to be the ONLY
way to go if i didnt want a panel bus trashed.. But all the blasters are
insisting that they can use silica (somethin about 80 grit) sand on my panel
and not have ANY warpage cause they are just so damn skilled etc etc
So what do I do? are they just bs'ing me? Anyone ever silica blasted a
panel? Got prices from 250 to 400. Anyone have any thoughts on this matter?
