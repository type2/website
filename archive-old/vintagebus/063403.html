&gt;Going to help a buddy change out his blown carbed 1800. He's got a good FI
&gt;short block. Anybody know the best type/way to mount an electric fuel pump?

The directions on a couple of different electric fuel pumps I've installed
want the pump to be close to the tank, although this is not super-critical
on a Bus since the engine and tank are so close together.

If the pump comes with any rubber bushings or grommets for the mounting,
use them.  It will help cut down on the noise transmitted into the
bodywork.  The nice Holley pump I have used had a mounting bracket
exactly like the one for a stock VW ignition coil, except it had rubber
bushings where the mounting screws went.

Try to mount it somewhere where you can get to the back side so you
can use nuts and bolts instead of sheet metal screws.  Use lock washers
or self-locking nuts or even both on these connections.

Try to locate the pump so that the fuel lines in and out don't have to
make any really sharp kinks or bends.

It's always nice to &quot;design for maintenance&quot;, but in my experience,
electric fuel pumps don't fail that often.  If you have to &quot;hide&quot; the
pump a little bit it will probably be OK.

I know it's tempting but don't use one of the mounting bolts for a
ground connection.  Run the ground wire to a nearby separate bolt into
the sheet metal (use a star washer to bite in for a better ground) or
run it all the way back to the battery or some other good ground point.
If you have to extend the wires that come with the pump, use at least
14 gauge stranded wire.

Good luck!
