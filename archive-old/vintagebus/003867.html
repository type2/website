cool - I to have a 60 standard - his birthday is today ;).  Someone once
told me that option code is for large handles on the pop-out windows, or
spoon shaped handles, or ..... something about the handles/levers on the
pop-out windows.


&gt;
&gt; I have a 1960 standard with an mcode of 374.  Anyone know what this one
is?
&gt; Haven't been able to find it in any of the decoders.  Other than  ???  at
&gt; least.
&gt;
&gt; I know what the others are, but this 374 is buggin me.
&gt;

jdd 60 std.
