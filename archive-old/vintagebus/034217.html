there are a lot of stories from this show , but there is a couple i would
like to share now.

In the photos there are pictures of a zebra strip painted westy, This was a
66 walkthrough westy
with 43,000 original miles, new brakes and tires, all this bus needed was a
little TLC, a couple of rockers
and a little body work, the floors were perfect and it was complete and
running. THIS was the auction bus,
the high bid was 1000 dollars and that's what it sold for!!! the high bidder
brought the bid up from 875 because the 
bus was to nice to let go for only 875. After he won the bid he turned
around and sold it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not for a profit, but for a lose to the gentleman who had bid 875 He did
this to help us raise more money for the
Arizona Home for Abused Children. (the LBB charity)

The LBB clubs choice and the Jerry Jess trophy went to Brian! (VTO) He found
a bus (57? double door) put it together,
(in 4 days)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
and drove out solo to BBB IV (350 miles one way) on. expired tags, since
1983? or thereabouts, no mirrors
or drivers seat, he sat on a chair cushion, the engine came out of his bug ,
which is his daily driver and hadn't had a tune-up since Jerome in
September, his fuel line plugged on the way out, so he punched a hole in his
gas tank and ran the fuel line trough it, front pressed bumper was there but
not bolted and 4 miss matched tires, but he made it, Now there is a loyal
BBB follower, he'd make it no matter what and he did. There's more but I'm
sure the stories will get around, like the cop who let him off for expired
tags after he heard his stories. A huge KUDOS for Brian the bus driver of
the new millennium.

NEWS FLASH:::::: just got a phone call, it sounds like Brian (see story
above) made it back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

more stories to come, but I'll wait to see what others have to say.
