Subject: Re: [VB] Removing broken tap from chassis rail

I know that some specialized shops burn out the taps. I do not know how 
portable the machine is. I had a tap burned out 20 years ago but I am 
sure that procedure is still current technology.

My friend Jake has managed to snap a tap in the chassis rail on his 
bus.  He
was tapping it as the thread for the bolt holding on the beam was 
slightly
damaged, but as he was backing the tap out after the second pass it 
snapped
off.  He thinks the tap was slightly off centre as it snapped as he 
didn't
have much room.

The tap is broken off about 5mm deep into the rail and he has tried 
drilling
it from behind with small carbide drills with not much success.

Anyone got any ideas on how to remove it?  You can see down the four 
sides
of the tap - but there is only 1.5mm clearance and I can't think of 
anything
that we could put down each side to assist.  Any ideas???
