Subject: Frydaye Toy

Head's up!  Was strolling through the local department store today and 
happened to meander down the toy aisle.  Hanging with all the kewl Hot 
Wheels cars was this year's Johnny Lightening offering...  Split single 
cab.  In grey and white.  Ain't never seen a single cab toy before....

Keep your eyes open, collectors.

Jim
