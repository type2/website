when i first started to seriously look for a bus, i had my heart set on a 
particular setup. a split window non pop top camper walk through. 
unfortunately buses are slim picking's around me, so i finally settled on my 
'67 Deluxe, which i love. so here i am, 6 mos. later and well into the 
restoration when i drive down the street and see.....that's right, a non pop 
top walk through literally a half a mile from my house. no for sale sign or 
anything, just plenty of hippie stickers and an awful spray can paint job. i 
guess they're new in the area as i have never seen the bus before, and i 
drive down that street often. i plan on stopping by and inquiring, so i'll 
keep you updated.
