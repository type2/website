&gt;Thanks to all of those that sent me emails on the '62 bus. I know
&gt;specific questions will come soon. I do have one about the headlights. I
&gt;know there is a rubber piece that goes inside of the headlight housing,
&gt;but is there one for the outside like is on the taillights?


There is a rubber seal that goes around the lip of the headlight bucket. It
has a &quot;T&quot; cross section and is maybe an eighth of an inch wide and tall.
Stretches around the lip and then the headlight assembly goes on. Make sure
your ground wire is connected and the connection surfaces are clean as most
headlights are probably grounded through the metal lip since the rubber fell
off.
