Subject: pick and pull

Now that Bry's has closed up shop in Seattle ( I see
the site made it on to the King Co. Toxic Cleanup
sheet) I can't seem to find another pick and pull
wrecking yard in the Seattle area.  Does anyone have
any suggestions?  I'm willing to travel a reasonable
distance for a decent yard.
Thanks,
Scott
