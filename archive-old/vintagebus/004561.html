Hello everyone

You don't know me... I'm the proud owner of a '66 walk-through standard =
bus with a Canterbury-Pitt camper conversion (which I gather was a =
rather down-market conversion company here in England). Bearing in mind =
that I go into a cold sweat at the thought of changing a wheel, I may be =
pestering you all with elementary questions in future (I'm planning on =
getting to grips with the mechanical side). You can always tell me to =
shut up if it gets tiresome.

I've got some questions I wonder if anyone has any comments on? How can =
I get hold of Bob Hoover's Sermons CD, of which I've heard such glowing =
reports, and have it sent to me in London? I visited a web site selling =
it, but they only take orders from the US and Canada.

My second question is about the pop-top - it's a bloody great =
square-looking thing that in my view spoils the van at the moment. I was =
wondering if anyone makes a slightly more harmonious-looking roof =
thingie. There are bunk-beds in there at the moment that I don't mind =
getting rid of.

Finally, the thing's done up like an ice-cream van - white and kind of =
shocking blue below the waistline. Now I know the bus (as opposed to the =
Kombi) came in two colours, but would it be considered a crime to =
re-spray it all one colour - I thought a grey-greeny-khaki-ish might be =
rather nice. I could always pretend it's a Kombi and hide the heater in =
the back. But seriously, I don't know if I'm being reckless or taking it =
all too seriously?

Thanks for your patience, and keep up the good work

James
