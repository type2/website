George  and anyone else,

I was trying to come up with a way to test for belt  slippage short of taking
a direct rpm reading of both the crank pulley and  the alternator pulley as
rpm is increased, and then taking the data and  checking the speed ratio of
the two. Since I haven't any other  instrumentation, maybe there is a way by
using a timing light and placing a  mark on the alternator pulley and looking
at how the mark either advances  or retards. The advance or retard should be
consistent spacialy if the  pulley is not slipping, that is the change in
position of the mark should  be constant if the belt is not slipping. For
example, the mark on the  alternator pulley may move a 1/4 turn ahead for
each revolution of the  drive pulley and if slipping it would move a
different increment. Hmmm  things may move too fast to really see what is
going on at 3-4000  rpm.

Any thoughts? It might work. I will try it some time and give  feedback.

This test may be best performed at night when the strobe is  not washed out
by daylight.

Chris



I cant see it working as the alternator pulley turns at a different speed  to 
the crank shaft. A cheap bicycle computer might be used to read the  speed 
that the pulley revolves. Mike
