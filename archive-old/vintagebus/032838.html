Hi John,
We highly doubt the transformer thingy you describe is a resistor/voltage 
drop.  More than likely it is a starter solinoid relay.  Best to remove your 
starter and compare the starter gear to other starters to figure out which it 
is, or better yet remove the engine and count the FW teeth to figure our 
which FW is in there.  Then you need to use a voltmeter to see if all the 
voltage from the battery is getting all the way up to the fuse box, head 
light switch, ignition switch and back to the starter solinoid.  If there is 
any voltage drop any more than half a volt you need to clean and solder 
things up to prevent this dropage from affecting not only the starter, but 
from causing you slow wipers, dim headlights and signal lights!  If there is 
less than half a volt drop through the system you probably need to clean out 
your starter and solder in four new starter brushes.  Often cheapie starter 
rebuilds only install two of these four brushes which makes for less 
longevity of the starter motor.    Eric&amp;Barb
