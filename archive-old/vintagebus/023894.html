Subject: Re: Coments on recent lists.

1: Still think NEATO is the best
 2: It was 121 in Lake Havasu tues, hotter today (wed.) and like Everret
still drive the Binz everyday to and from work.
 3: If the bus ain't stock do what you want ( lowering, chopping, V8ing)
 4: Mark in florida &lt;neato64&gt; jumped on the rader wheel. Will ship to
him after recieving m.o. and told him i would refund m.o. and he could
burn me on the list if he was not happy.
 5: How much did VonBondo pay for his neato B/D camper? Was he one of
the lucky 13?
