Where exactly is the ground wire that attaches to or

my guage not to work.

well it could be anything.  but get a flashlight and your contortioists hat
and look around in front of the motor- past the fan housing- one wire plugs
into the sender, another ground the sender to the body.

 Additionally my high beams don't
want to switch off.  I looked for a dimmer switch on
the floor, after reading my (63-67 Bentley, $70 from
JC whitney after delivery!!!) I guess I don't have
one.  Is there a relay I need to replace or reground?
Slowly but surely I will fix everything up on the 67.

it's on the turn signal stalk for 66/67.   flip it up to switch from high to
low and back.

Also, can I remove the back/closer to front engine tin
w/out dropping the engine.  Ie: remove gas line and
starter bolt plus 2 egine tine screws.  Thanks for
putting up w/my LAMO questions.
