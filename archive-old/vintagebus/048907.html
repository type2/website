Well, I wanted to make a big surprise splash, but with mucho discussion on cupholders, I decided to let the cat out of the bag.

I've been working on a coupla prototypes for bus cupholders now for several months.  I've just finished two different designs and will be fine tuning them over the next day or so.  The designs leave the front of the dash alone, are quick and easy to install, and can be located (within reason) based on each owner's preference.

First blush on cost looks to be quite affordable, under $15.00 each.  I was hoping to be able to make them in original L code colors, but that might not be feasible, especially in terms of cost.

In the meantime, if anyone is interested or has any suggestions, feel free to pmail me.  As soon as I select a design and have concrete costs, I'll post the info and have pictures available.

Robert
