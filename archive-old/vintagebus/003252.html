After having suffered multiple vent wing latch failures, I am looking into
making the bases for the latches from solid stainless steel (not cast).
These would require the re-use of the existing latch handle, spring, spring
washer and button. I have already produced the drawings for the parts and
issued them to my programer to get the ball rolling. We have the CNC
capacity to produce the parts.
I just wanted to get some opinions on the potential market acceptance of
these parts. I won't know what the cost will be until we have programmed and
run some, but they should come out under $20 ea. in small runs.
All opinions welcome, so lets hear it.
