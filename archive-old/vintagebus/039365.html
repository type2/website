Alright, I've given up on the vinyl flooring, this orig stuff has to go the 
underflooring is completely rotted out.  Anybody know a good source for 
vintage vinyl flooring and formica?  My wife wants me to use pergo or some 
other type of wood flooring, anyone done this or seen it?  Would be 
interested in how it looks.  I am sure is contrasts the old paneling.

Bart
