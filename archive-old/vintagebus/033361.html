I am looking for a frame or a set from Oliver Imported Cars which was on 
Shattuck Ave in Berkeley.  Went belly up in the late 60's I am told.  But my 
64 bus used to have one of their plate frames on the back before I got it.  
It said BERKELEY at the top and OLIVER at the bottom.  I have been asking 
around about these for 2 years, no luck.  No VW emblems on these frames...
Thanks,
Dan Morris
