Subject: Re: [VB] VW's new ad

I saw that ad too. This must be why they've been cracking down on
intellectual property rights lately. At first, I thought they were in denial
of their past. But it turns out, they want to use it for promotion, and make
sure no one else is cashing in.

Subject: [VB] VW's new ad


&gt;    This a probably a Friday subject but I'll forget by then, so here I go.
&gt;   I was watching the tube and a new VWoA commercial came on it showed a
&gt; cartoonish bug and a Split Bus. Then went on to showing the new Beetle and
a
&gt; Jetta, then the commercial went on to say Things to Come? and showed a
&gt; silhouette of what looked like a bus!
&gt;    Are they priming us for the NEW Microbus, VWoA does own that name as of
&gt; November 8th 2000
