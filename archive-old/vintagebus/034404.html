Guy harding is presently setting up a 'new' website at

http://www_dot_users.bigpond_dot_com/msn/guyh/

Its still a bit bare bones but seems to progressing
a lot every time I check it.  For the USers, he repros
very nice roof racks and while considerably cheaper
than comparable products in the US,
the cost of freight etc could just about wipe out
the price differential.  Might be well worth checking out
though.
