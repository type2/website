&lt;&lt; Alright... heres the deal..
 brand new mexican motor...won't idle... it'll rev just fine...but will
 not idle....it will idle high IF the stepped choke cam is not fully in
 the &quot;on&quot; position.  If the choke is FULLY open...it will not idle...
 even with the throttle arm all the way down.  If I pump the gas...it
 will rev though...
 I tried 2 different carbs...no help.  The one that is on there I rebuilt
 with a rebuild kit and copius amounts of carb cleaner....replacing both
 diaphrams  ( 34PICT-3 ) &gt;&gt;

I have for some reason had problems with those 34 picts.    seems to me that 
a lot of them will not idle, and the other half will not rev.   

Then again the carb I have had on my bug for 50 K mile (30/31)   had the same 
problem a couple months ago,  got bad outside a VW dealership where I went to 
get some parts (how embarrassing)   took a while to start, then I had to keep 
revving it to keep it runnung to get home, this problem went away when I 
cleaned it out and rebuildt it.   

when I got this motor a few years ago for Bugster to replace the motor that 
was my exes that was in my bug, it had a 34 pict and idle problems, so I used 
an adaptor plate and my 30/31 pict for it.

Anyway, I suggest you get a single port carb and an adaptor plate for the 
motor.
