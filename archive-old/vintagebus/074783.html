  This bent the hell

Looked at the pics, &amp; it appears to moi the hoops/endcaps can be easily
straightened. Try your local blacksmith.
Try  Dropgates_dot_com for rear gates f.s. or it can be fixed, but probably more
$$$ than another rear gate.

  Is the guy who was doing
&gt; the repro hoops still in business?  I sent him an email and got
&gt; no response.

Yep, Derek Gregg in Lancaster, CA. He's not very fast to get back on email,
but he's there &amp; meeting his promise dates from what I hear. New sets are
$400. Very nice also. Ph. 661-946-1303
