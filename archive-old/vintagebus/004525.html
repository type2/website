pop the valve covers for a free look and
clues to what might lurk deeper.
i don't think the rubber seals could be any
good by now, including push rod and crank
seals, and i wouldn't consider running an
engine w/ rust on the exposed internals
not bathed in oil for 22 years. whatever.

you should probably try to free up the rings
as suggested and spin the engine for a full
minute on the starter to get some oil pressure
and lubrication started.  (plugs out ).
let the starter cool and repeat.
