This brings up the question - what causes more wear and tear - my kids or the dog? I don't think I will let any of them in the side tent again:)

Side tents have a high cool factor. I recall one bus event where there were no fewer the 11 Westy side tents set up! On the other hand they are bulky, heavey and spendy. If you are gonna stay put in one camping spot for at least two night then they can be worth it. Especially if you have kids with you. For quick and dirty camping they are a pain in the a$$.


Knowing Meredith and Debbie they will take good of whatever they buy!
