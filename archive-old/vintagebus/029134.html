Subject: ps - oops

oops, sorry, I just checked and calimports doesn't have anything
about this weekend's show on their website.  I just assumed,
since they usually do, and since they're sponsoring it...
Anyway, if you want to know about it, email me.  I don't have the
details right now, but I think there's drag racing and a cruise
on Saturday this year in addition to the usual Sunday show.
Diana
