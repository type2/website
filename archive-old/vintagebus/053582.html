Subject: RE: [VB] need a ride from Phoenix to BBB VI

Casey, you would need to change the departure to the 21st It is a holiday as
the last raffles at BBB VI are on Sunday the 20th around 10-11 am.
  We hold the last raffle AFTER the Boy Scout pancake breakfest and when the
camp sites are clean!!! 
  We try to have everthing rapped up by noon being there are a lot of people
who need to hit the road early.

Subject: [VB] need a ride from Phoenix to BBB VI


to AZ listmembers,
i am seriously planning on flying down from
minneapolis for BBB VI. i found some cheap plane
tickets online and if i can work it out, i'd be
arriving in Phoenix on the 16th sometime mid-day. if
you have more than one bus you want to bring, i'd love
to drive it down/sleep in it for you. there will
probably be two of us along for the ride. we would
need to be back to the airport on the 20th at 9 am or
so. let me know if you can help me help you ;)

p.s. you can AIM me at &quot;dormocasey&quot;
