  Hi all, I need the infamous 5' X 5' baltic birch paneling.  This would be the 'all wood',
3mm (1/8&quot;), stuff.  Archives were great help but I need a source, can't find it locally.  
So I'll be in the Phoenix area in December, to visit the sister-in-law (eeeekkkk!!!!-call 911).
  Please help, with the panels, need address/phone numbers, anywhere near, even Tucson
area!
   T I A
