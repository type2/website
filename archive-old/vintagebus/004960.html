&quot;Yes, but retail POS (point of sale) systems are more &quot;auditable&quot;.
Although
I wonder how many sales go unreported at little mom and pop stores where
they write your
receipt on a generic pad they bought at the dime store.&quot;

More right than you know.  CA's St. Board gets pretty nasty if they think
you're up to something, though.  They can go to your deposits or your
lifestyle to see if sales support it.  Otherwise, they take an industry
standard of taxable sales and charge the proprietor the tax, penalties and
interest.
