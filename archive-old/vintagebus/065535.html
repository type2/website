Subject: safari windows

In my recently acquired van both safari windows had been removed. I 
would like to now put them back in. Does the windshield glass fit the 
frames?

I am missing the wing bolt hardware and the lock tabs that hold the 
twist locks at the bottom of the windshield.

Also needed are stainless steel sheet metal screws to reattach the hinge 
to the bus at the top of the windows.

I'm looking for these hardware items and only find full kits for sale. 
Does anyone know where I can find just parts? Thanks for your ideas in 
advance.
