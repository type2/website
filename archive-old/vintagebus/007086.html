&gt; Incorrect.  Standard procedure for pulling the engine on a bus with a
main/reserve valve is to put the valve in the &quot;half-way&quot; position, which
shuts off all flow (theoretically, you still get a slow drip usually).
&gt;
My off position is off, no drip.  No means no, off means off.  Any other
situation you better check it.
