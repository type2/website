Ya, Rousch? Racing has 6 cars in the race, all the engines were built in the
NASCAR shop, very sweet sounding engines if I must say. I think they were
all flatheads FORD.

It was fun seeing all of these cars and amazing what they do. It was about
110 degree's when they started to arrive and that was at 6pm.

Quite the gathering. I looked at www.greatrace_dot_com and they don't have
Havasu up yet.

ps. My 5 year old daughter won the coloring contest for the race (Havasu
leg) in the 8 and under class. She drew a bus/slug bug picture.

The Great Race regulations are pretty liberal when it comes to powerplants
and drive trains, and it's interesting to see what's under the bonnet of
some of those cars.

They may be pretty old rigs, but they are often amazingly quick off the
line.  Power to weight ratio rules, regardless of the age or relative
crudity of the design and/or engineering.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  The great race has come and gone, a lot of excitment for our town, not
as much as Buses by the Bridge though :~). One of the highlights was seeing
and talking to Bill Collins in his 49 HEB, the only VW in the race and we'll
let him slide being he was running a Porsche 356 engine of course it was of
49 vintage!
