Look at it this way:

Most of us are employed.  If you're not, you maybe
should be looking for a job and not futzing with yout bus.

Minimum wage is ~$6/hr; let's set a base rate of $8/hr

2 hours to futz with a speaker, painting, drying, etc is $16.  If
you need a speaker *that* badly, a new Radio shack one is $6.  99%
of the time you're hooking it up to a sapphire I or early blaupinkt,
which aren't the sanzziest radios out there anyway.  If you have a 
fancy-schamnzy CD player, then what are you doing dinking with the
stock speaker in the first place?

1 hour and a can of brake cleaner will run you about $10.  For $25
you can get a new clutch disk, and save yourself the hassle (more $$)
to pull the engine a second time and replace the clutch disk then.
Think of the fuel mileage improvements with a new clutch!  There's 
some incremental savings right there!  Unless you simply got some
fingerprints or grease on a brand new disk, it's false economy.

I've witnessed someone use an entire can of carb cleaner on a
used fuel pump he was going to stash asway for a rainy day.  Why?

Now if you're in BFE by the side of the road, then it's catch as catch can
get the car on the road any way you can.    Whiz on the dang thing
if that's what it takes.

Support the VW suppliers whenever possible, so they'll keep
making the parts we need!
