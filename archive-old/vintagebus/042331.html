True. Very true.   After you get that valve open, or off, turn the tank
upside down and insert an air line into the tank.  pump air into the tank
(not to pressureize the tank, you mearly want to wash the propane vapors
out) and let it come back ou the same hole.


propane  is heavier then air, so that it would need to be forced .down.
and out.


feel free to clean the tank with your favorite mild clensing solution once
you have the vapors purged.
