&gt; &lt;&lt; Good point, reminds me of the folks that have the the slow CPUs with
&gt; high megahertz ratings. Know anybody like that? =^)

Back in the old days when computers had an LED display on the front
proudly showing the CPU frequency, I figured out that the display was
simply hardwired to display a single number.  My middle of the road 33MHz
computer suddently became a 99MHz screamer!  :) &gt;

&gt; However squirrels are mighty strong for their size, and most especially
&gt; they are fast climbers--it just isn't right, it don't fit, Joe!
&gt;
&gt; I suggest for a rating standard the pulling power of some sort of
&gt; gastropod, probably something like a slug, as they are weak and
&gt; horizontally opposed, and behind them they leave a shiny slick.

I was perusing one of the Riceboy groups a while back and a fellow there
was bemoaning the lack of performance Honda cars.  He had a little chart
of power to weight ratios, with 16 lb/HP being good and 20 lb/HP being
bad.  A little math reveals that my bus is, roughly:

3000lb/50HP=60lb/HP
