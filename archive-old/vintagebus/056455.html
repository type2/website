Subject: [VB] tranny feeling a little loose


&gt;My transaxle isn't in the best shape i know. When i changed my gear oil a
&gt;broken washer fell out! My bus is a 67 deluxe with the orginal sing-axle
&gt;tranny. My question is, i want to take the bus on a trip to floridy some
&gt;time during june. I live in arkansas. it's going to be a long drive. what do
&gt;I need to do to make my tranny reliable enough to get me down to the beach?

a trailer would be better than a dolly in this case !
There are no extra parts in your transaxle.
Something is coming apart, time to disassemble.
