Subject: did i forget something?

hey all
i tried pulling my rear drivers side brake drum on the 62 today to get
to the wheel cylinder.....but no luck.  I took off the axle nut and
cotter pin, and adjusted the shoes so that they were nowhere near
touching the drum lining.  I yanked and yanked to no avail.  Am I
forgetting something here??  It appears as if the axle stub is greased
too....there is a little oozing out.  I kept the wheel on for pulling
power.... (that and the last schmuck who took the wheels off used an
impact wrench!!) do i need to remove the wheel??... or just pull
harder??

thanks
