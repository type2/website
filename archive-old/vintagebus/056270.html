Subject: Re: [VB] WTB Steering Box

I just went through a whole drama about my steering box. Wolfgang gave me
alot of advice and help on stuff to do before I bought theirs. I ended up
opening and finding that it wasn't my problem, but through extensive whining
and phone calling of everyone who would listen, I was assured that Wolfgang
may be the ONLY place to get them rebuilt. All of my sources for old ones
all felt that I was just going to get a 40 year old thing that may not be
better than the one I had.

And if I had to get a new one I could trust that I was getting a good box
from Wolfgang. You might have to bight the bullet.

&gt;
&gt; I gotta replace the steering box on the '58 Single Cab.  Anyone happen to
have a good to excellent used one lying around??  Shipping both ways + $200
for a rebuilt one from Wolfgang isn't really my first choice.
&gt;
&gt; TIA.
