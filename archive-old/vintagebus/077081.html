Subject: Re: [VB] 113 PN ID

i think the number must be wrong. the second group of
numbers, &quot;323&quot; would indicate a transmission part, but
i don't think they don't go that high. my guess is
that it would be &quot;823&quot;, which would make a little more
sense if  it's a rubber seal of some kind. the number
given is not in any of my parts manuals.
 
but i could just be completely insane.

and just because it has a &quot;113&quot; does not it is bug
specific. there are plenty of parts on busses that
start with &quot;113&quot;


a pic would definitely help. 

this sounds like a question for '67 Transporters with
his multitude of parts manuals!

&gt; Well, a part number starting with 113 is for a

&gt; it?

&gt; &gt; Anyone want to ID this for me?
