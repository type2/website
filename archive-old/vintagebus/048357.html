Subject: DIGEST REPOST - POR-15 Tie-Coat Primer comments?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

This is a repost for digest readers only.  If you are a regular subsriber to 
VB list, you already got this clogging up you mail once, so now you get to 
delete it again, sorry.  Thom says some digests may not have gone out 
recently (I didn't get 778, 779, 982, 983, 984 but have read them online at 
http://www.type2_dot_com/vintagebusreflect/)  I am reposting with Thom's 
approval.  
--------------------------------

Has anyone used the POR-15 Tie-Coat primer and would like to comment on his 
or her experience?  I have primed the bottom and some of the inside of my 
project with silver POR-15, and there is no way I can sand all the knooks and 
crannies for topcoating.  This Tie-coat primer is supposed to go over POR-15 
without sanding, and I was wondering if folks have had success with it.  I 
noticed it was polyurethane isocyanate (which is good in my book), but it is 
single component, so I am warry.  I plan to topcoat with Glasurit 22 line.

Here is the info on the Tie-Coat primer:

My Dupont supplier recommends Dupont Prime 'N Seal 2600/2700 to do the same 
thing (stick without sanding the substrate).  This is a non-sanding 
primer-sealer which does not require sanding before topcoating.  

Thoughts appreciated, Tom Good in Vermont
