hello,

i have a rebuilt bosch starter that i thought would
fit into my 1966 tranny, but it is definitely too
large to mount onto the tranny. can anyonetell me what
kind of tranny this starter fits onto by the #'s?

bosch
made in germany
0 001 211 223 (a symbol) 224
(vw and audi symbols) 055 911 023 B


thanks to all for the previous assistance on the 12v
conversion. i couldn't get through this without you.

e.s.
