Subject: RE: [VB] bus (still) does not idle

  An interesting thing that happened to me in the same situation. After
changing every part I could with new I still had the same problem. Took the
engine out to change everything again and upon instalation the main wire to
the coil came apart (the PO spliced it), upon fixing the coil wire the bus
ran perfect. Seems like the coil wasn't getting the full voltage needed to
run right. 

ronnie, just anther thing to check on these old buses

List,

I spent the last few days removing the carb, cleaning it, putting it back
on,
I even replaced the fuel lines ( they were old and nasty) The timing is
correct. The fuel cut-off is working.  Any ideas of where to look next?  the
bus starts and runs as long as you keep your foot on the pedal.  As soon as
you take it off, the bus winds down like you shut the key off.   The engine
in
question is a 1600 DP with a brosol 30/31.  Anyone have any suggestions
before
I give up and take it to the mechanic (I don't really want to.)

-Tom
