although i'm not super big on buying cars on ebay, those interested in a
decent, solid 67 deluxe PORJECT, check this one out.  I WORKED ON THIS BUS.
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND DRIVING IT OUT OF ALBUQUERQUE!  it does run and
drive, but i doubt any work has been done to make it interstate roadworthy,
but i'd ask them if you're seriously interested.  i believe it was
originally white on white. it's a walkthru.  hey, enough of me selling it,
if you're interested, you'll contact the seller
