So grind away the bell housing to make the flywheel fit.  Engine goes in and 
will turn by hand, good sign. But when I electrify the starter (which is a 12 
Volt starter) I get a click and then nothing. The starter is hanging up on the 
flywheel. 
Hi John,
12 volt FW is a 12 volt FW, all with the same outside diameter.  When a 
starter hangs up on a FW it will rotate the engine but not release the FW so thusly 
continuing turning the engine till the battery runs out of energy or until 
something burns out!!  BTDT...  Pull starter and test in another bellhousing 
first.  Did you install a 12 volt starter bushing!?!?  Check, clean, tighten ALL 
electrical connections, ESPECIALLY THE GROUND CABLES.
