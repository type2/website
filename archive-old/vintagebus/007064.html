This is not that unusual. Here in the &quot;arctic Chicagoland area&quot; we don't see
too many splits. Over the last few years I've seen 2, maybe 3 of them (and
I'm not counting mine). But just the other day I took a long drive
south-west to drop my rims to get them sandblasted and here we go!, I
spotted a Bus sitting behind a barn. It was cold as hell but I turned
around, stopped and looked it over from a distance. Unfortunatelly it's a
bay, 1971 but still intact, just waiting to be rescued. I even left a note
for the owner and he called me. Always worth a try, the guy used to work on
ACVW's in the past and still has a stash of parts left. Looks like I'm
meeting the guy next week. They are out there, you just have to be patient.

Good luck!


&gt; when i first started to seriously look for a bus, i had my heart set on a
&gt; particular setup. a split window non pop top camper walk through.
&gt; unfortunately buses are slim picking's around me, so i finally settled on
my
&gt; '67 Deluxe, which i love. so here i am, 6 mos. later and well into the
&gt; restoration when i drive down the street and see.....that's right, a non
pop
&gt; top walk through literally a half a mile from my house. no for sale sign
or
&gt; anything, just plenty of hippie stickers and an awful spray can paint job.
i
&gt; guess they're new in the area as i have never seen the bus before, and i
&gt; drive down that street often. i plan on stopping by and inquiring, so i'll
&gt; keep you updated.
