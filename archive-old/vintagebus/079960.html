Subject: classic insurance

I have my '64 Standard with Hagerty, stated value, no deductible on
collision or comprehensive, state minimums on injury. $137 per year.
Have to have a daily driver with another insurance company, and cannot
drive it to work, otherwise no restrictions on mileage or use. My other
carrier, GEICO, does not cover vehicles over 20 years old.

Fargo, ND
