Hi Aaron,
Hmmmmm, you really should consider running 1600 or slip in 1641 P&amp;Cs with a 
stock 69mm crank with welded on counter wieghts for smoother/quieter engine.  
The bigger ccs for a bus is good, and we have VW photo that shows the 1600 
was at least an option for the bus from about 1965 in some part/s of the 
world.  As always you are the only one who can be guarenteed to really spend 
tons of time blueprinting your engine till it is just right!  p Plus if you 
learn not only how to rebuild or build an engine correctly, but the added 
benefit of knowing how it all works first hand!    Eric&amp;Barb
