&gt; Ok, this 1966 bus thing is new to me. I drag the bus down off the car dolly
&gt; and it sits askew off my driveway. The back brakes are frozen somehow, so I
&gt; crawl under yesterday to back off the star adjustment thingy. #)*&amp;^_at_#%_at_ There
&gt; is no adjustment hole. Is it behind the reduction boxes? How does one get out
&gt; of this catch 22? 

The adjustment is done via a hole in the *drum*; take off the hubcap and
you'll see it.

&gt; I also checked the compression on the old engine. 0/20/0/30. Bummer. Well, I
&gt; will have to convert to 12V sooner or later anyway. What use is the old motor?

A core on a rebuild.

&gt; After I get the newer 1600cc (just incase of core charge or something), I will
&gt; write and give/trade it to the list.

THe engine builder will prolly want the old one, unless it's single relief,
or you're buying a MexiMotor.

While you've got your wallet open, go out and buy a new set of rubber lines for
the brakes, and couple quarts of brake fluid.  Replace thelines, and flush
'em real good.
