Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Full-Flow System Oil Pressure

ok this is easy, you already told us what was wrong!!!!
oil goes in to the remote lines and only a little (Low pressure) comes out

A quick (and dangerous way) is to mount the pressure sender at the &quot;end&quot; 
of the remote lines.
start engine and see what you get. Obviously you cant run engine more 
then 10 seconds
OR if you have a way to pressureize the lines-grease gun-compressor be 
creative.
use compressed air through just as a sort of qualitative test. switch 
filters

I agree with the technical guys I am an engineer too- I worked for over 
10 years as a mechanic for a few on air cooled vw's
Sounds like a simple problem.  The hoses could be too small but not too big.

one time i used a pump/filter one piece unit and it had adequate 
pressure at hwy speed but at idle the light flickered- I gave it away 
and changed to a gene berg cover and full flow filter. taped the oil 
gallery and ran an HP-1 filter worked great
