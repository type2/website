&gt; Joe, you sound like a pro already!  ;-)

Heh.  Thanks.  But I still wonder if the engine I built three years ago is
gonna fly apart on my next trip out of town. :-)

Made a teeny bit of progress tonight due to interruptions (dang kids with
their lives).  Got the axle tube retainers snugged up with three gaskets
each side, smeared with clear silicone.  Had a bit of a scare when one of
the studs turned into the case because the nut was hanging on it, but I
fashioned a grabber by cutting a slit out of a spare nut and clamping it
to the stud with vise-grips (to avoid mangling the threads).  Backed it
out and cleaned it up, reinserted with loctite.

Also tapped in one upper inner bearing and got the other one started, but
it was late and I didn't want to keep the neighbors awake.  Depending on
the quality of tomorrow night's traditional Friday happy hour beerfest at
the local 40+ drafts establishment, I might get as far as closing up the
boxes afterwards.  Don't wanna be torquing and shtaking the inner nutsh if
I'm &lt;hic&gt; burping Spaten Lager fumes, though.
