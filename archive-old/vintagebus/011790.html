THERE ARE CARS, and there are cars-and then there's the Volkswagen!
As one enthusiast described it: &quot;The VW
is not just a car, it's a disease.
And a contagious one at that!&quot;
quoted from my 1955 POPULAR MECHANICS
that just showed up today. must have been lost
an awfull long time.
so if this was happening back in ol 55
it's still happening today, and it's catching
hold of the rastas, piercers, dreads, straits
rednecks,upper-lower middle class. you all get my drift? one planet, one peoples car
