Subject: Re: [VB] 009 distributor

This should get you well on your way, although it is an 010

http://www.glenn-ring_dot_com/010/

does have some good parts# info as well

&gt; Looking for the web page that had a pictorial of how to rebuild the 009
&gt; distributor, or any page that has information on rebuilding one. I also
&gt; can't locate the blow up picture of the parts and part list. Any help
&gt; out there?
