What?.................Mark, check your gas tank for any leaking fuel.  I
think you have been under for too long!

You Wrote:


Hi Bus,  Hey! How did you get that name?     Well my
name is &quot;No Name&quot; after a great black lab dog that
Mark had as a buddy back more than 20 years ago during
his past beach days but do not bring it up to him.You
will get him thinking back to those days when he was
young and in shape.Then he will start drinking cheap
wine and want to sleep in me at the beach....How did
you get your name?

Thank you.
