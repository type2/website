Oh boy, here we go with *that* ball of wax! Yes, there are conversions
that are possible. I've stayed with 67 masters. They work fine, last a
long time, and are repairable. Others will offer different conversions
that prolly work as well. I keep a spare on hand, plus a rebuild kit, but
I'm wierd anyway!
