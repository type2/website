&lt;&lt; No juice to the dash at all, as if there wasn't a battery. With some help 
from a good samaritan, I pushed the bus out of traffic, to a no parking zone, 
and hitched a ride to work.
  I think I must have fired a fuse somewhere but I'm clueless. Any thoughts 
or suggestions on any quick easy fixes would be greatly appreciated. &gt;&gt;
Hi Martin,
There is no single stock fuse that would shut down the entire electrical 
system.  Sounds more like you need to clean the battery cables at the battery 
and starter and inspect them for damage.  If in doubt replace the cables!
