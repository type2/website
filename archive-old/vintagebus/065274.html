Subject: Re: [VB] Pedal push rod rubbers

Yes; they go on from underneath and stay on the pedal shaft.  They
un-seal when you depress the pedal.

&gt; I bought some new push rod rubbers for my pedals - I think they are NOS as the
&gt; have the VW logo and the part number 211 721 387 on them.  I have no idea how
&gt; they should be fitted though?  They are pretty tight on the shaft of the
&gt; rubber, and they appears to be no way to retain them onto the cab floor.
&gt; Therefore I assume that they are fitted underneath as I have the felt glued
&gt; down above.  Is this correct?
