I try to keep stock what is practical and add what is needed, (thanks for
the 9-pin replacement circuit). Since my 67 SC is tooling around with
non-standard windshield wiper blades adapted to the original arms, turn
signal 9-pin modification, and a late model 71 DP engine, the one thing that
remains in common with the rest of the owners is that big smile and wave
when you pass me on the road!

At a near 67 years of age--coming soon on the day the Wright Brothers flew
at Kitty-Hawk, I have spent most of my years with cars--and Lots of them.
My 1st new car was a 1956 Chevy Belair--My 1st New VW was a 1965 Type I.
As you can see it took me a long time to find my way! As a side note the
price including tax was $1870.00 for a sunroof Type I--white
walls -radio--and they Threw in the cocoa mats!!
 Then sometime ago I Graduated to the VW Bus--No doubt one of the most
unique vehicles ever to hit the pavement--and the same goes for the
owner/drivers--The VW bus shows are like no other VW Show,They are really a
&quot;Get Togethers&quot;. Where we come together and meet new friends and expand our
relationships. The bus and its owners are bonded--We really do not care if
you have chrome on your motor or grease--We are just happy to see you with
us, as a Type II owner--
 I truly hope that &quot;Good Feeling&quot; stays with all of us for as long as we
want. It is truly refreshing to be surrounded by Type II owners and never be
concerned if my Type II is &quot;Correct&quot;. My buses are &quot;Correct&quot; for me, and my
enjoyment, for as long as Bessie and Rudolph are with me--And I'm sure the
same feelings are had by the rest of the Type II crowd. Air/cooled or
water/cooled, VW Buses are in a league All By Themselves--and deservedly so.
After all --The Type IIs represent Many Things to Many Volks--
Just--Keep on Truckin--TWWM, uj
