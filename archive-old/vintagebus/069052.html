Subject: Leaning Bus Continued/Shocks, etc..

Hi, All:

I was able to have the bus looked at last week and the mechanic found 
nothing, though he really didn't go in depth. He did find that one of my 
shocks is longer on the back. The fronts are the same. Could this be part of 
my problem? He said he everything else looked great, and my torsion springs 
seemed okay as well. I'm probably going to replace all 4 shocks, but could 
someone tell me what size they are using for a lowered bus such as mine? It 
has been lowered 3.5'' all around w/ spindles and IRS. I'm really bummed 
about this leaning problem.. :(

Incidently, I have posted pictures of my bus on Samba_dot_com. Here's a link to 
the first picture:   &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/index.mv?photo+69981.jpg&quot;&gt;TheSamba_dot_com - VW Gallery photos&lt;/A&gt; 


Enjoy, and thanks in advance for the help...
