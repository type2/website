Subject: Re: [VB] Rear Hatch Pin

The one I need is about 3/4&quot; to 7/8&quot; long from head to tip.  I think 
that's the short one.  Its not the one at the roof line, but the lower 
one.  Do you have one or know where I can get one?  I checked the 
archives but couldn't find a description how to do it.  I'm thinking 
alot of vise grips, a few guys and some steel bars, and a crash helmet.

&gt;&gt;Anyone out there know where I can get a pin for the rear hatch
&gt;&gt;('65/equiv) with that rounded rectangular head on it?  And if there's
&gt;&gt;any tricks for getting those torsion springs back I'd sure like to know....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;There is a long one and a short one.
&gt;Which one do you need?
&gt;I went thru the 'replace the broken spring' fun about 6 months ago. I think I
&gt;wrote about it and it may be in the archives.
