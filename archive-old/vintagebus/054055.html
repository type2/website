Woah!  I hope you mean &quot;generator&quot; and not &quot;alternator&quot;.  Attempts to
polarize an _alternator_ will damage it!

If it's a generator, you're probably hearing the new commutator segments.
Keep an eye on the brushes to make sure that the commutator isn't wearing
them out fast.


&gt; Also looking for advice regarding converting to electronic ignition =96vs=

&gt; points. . ..

Get the alternator fixed first.  I've never seen any need to switch to
electronic ignition, but some swear by it (and others at it).
