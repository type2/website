Subject: Wet behind the ears......

To the Real Bus people                          After
reading the &quot;Jealous&quot; line of emails and a long shot
of apricot brandy chased down by a bottle of (insert
your favorite beer here) I reach behind my ears to
feel the moistness that remains to this day from my
birth into the bus           
world..when?..Oh...yesterday! I have got a long ways
to go to catch you guys...if ever...never! I must say
I am just a newbie(even after 7 years of driving the
same bus) and chances are I will remain one forever.I
can drive'm if someone else can fix'm sort of dude.The
insight into the guts of these beasts from this list
of pros is something else.I really do enjoy reading
your emails and I will now return to my corner in
teach's room and keep my eyes open.....Keep up the
good work you real bus people.
