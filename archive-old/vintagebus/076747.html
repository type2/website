Wouldn't the water get in around the drum first ?? And aren't the bearings

Hi Mark,
At first glance you would think so, but the drum has a groove in it that the 
backing plate sticks into thusly forming a &quot;U&quot; shape the water has to work its 
way around.  With this groove and the spin of the drum the water is 
centrifugally forced outward.  Water invasion into suspension and brake parts happens 
mostly at higher MPH speeds when the wheels splash up water at velocities much 
like come out of a pressure washer.  Up here in rainy Washington state we have 
to pump the link pins full of new grease every 3,000 miles or have them rust 
up very quickly.  BTDT!  Additionally if the front backing plates are not 
sealed to the spindles the slight gap there wicks water directly right onto the 
part of the spindle where the inner wheel bearing seal seats rusting up this 
seating area and tearing up the grease seal.  Problem with the seal itself is two 
fold.  The later seal is designed only to keep grease back in with a single 
ridge and no pump ridges like the FW seals that could have been designed into 
the seal to pump the water outward and the earlier seals are just a felt ring 
in a outer metal collar.  Both are not designed for repeling out water from the 
outside.  As liquids go they are designed just for keeping in the thicker 
grease and most of the brake dust out.
