sheet metal is in and will be ready to ship to those that ordered monday
will post what i have left in stock, call or e-mail with special wants or
needs
will have doglegs,  complete front floors, cargo floors pieces (complete
if you need must call), rear wheel archs early and late and a restock of
floor parts
nose repair panels (lower ), rockers, battery trays and driver side tray and
rear
corners the ones i got look good,  all pieces look great, heavy metal and
almost
looks like powder paint finish on all pieces, a lot better then what i.ve
been getting
&gt;from the u.s. suppliers, worth the extra cost

who's going to bad camberg? it's only 2 1/2 months away, i think i'm going
to rent
a eurovan camper, checked on it and it's only 440.00 for the 5 days i'm
there
cheaper then a car and hotel, plus i'll be camping in a vw, just like going
to a show here
should feel just like home,  will somebody let me use there shower , could
get pretty
ripe after the flight and days of no showers, let all listy's get together
over there and let
them know we come in force

my 65 westy was painted white underneath, my 62 panel primered, my 64
sundial (panel converstion primer) don't remember my 61 single or 66 westy
but will check
and my friends 64 21 window delux sealing wax red underneath, and my 64
koombi
primered

hope this post my last 4 haven't but did grt through to some people, odd i
say
it even pmailed me, (my own post) as have a couple of list members post
has this happened to anyone else?
