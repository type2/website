Subject: Re: [VB] 65 door panels material source
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I ordered the Wolfsburg West repop door panels, kicks
and over head pieces when redoing the 67 Westy a few
years ago. I liked the look and feel of the doorpanels
but not the fit. They seemed to be about 3/8&quot; too
short and narrow on the total dimensions. Would have
worked great excepting the need of the clips for the
65-67.
Clips?: I salvaged as many old bus clips as possible
but was forced out of necessity to use many NOS ;-)
clips that I bought from the head of a nearly defunct
So-cal bus club. Yup! they were too short, have been
told that they are typeIII clips and tended to be a
PITA over the three and one half seasons that the
beast has been on the road. I dont know typeIII at all
so can't confirm.
I intend to bastardize the Westy and buy nylon/plastic
inserts for the holes, cut all of the panels out of
Baltic Birch to match the rest of the interior and
screw them in place. I'm over the VintageNazi thing
and prefer a bus that works and stays together. Take
it from me- the clips are a pain in the ass and will
tend to pop out and allow the expensive but nice repop
panels to warp and tweak due to the moisture. Even in
bone dry Southern Arizona mine eventually got warped.
Headliner and kicks remain nice.
