Subject: fuel gauges...and Paint....

Hello all,

   I was wondering if anyone knew if using an original 6volt fuel gauge on a
12Volt system should work accurately?  Thats what Im running right now,
and cant get the sender and gauge to calibrate perfectly. (full reads &gt; and
empty is actually just before it hits R)   My sender is original as well



For the paint question:  Im going to be blasting and repainting.  I want to
use Dove Blue and was wondering if using the original type of paint versus
matching it with a more modern urethane has any advantages or disadvantages?
Has anyone used a combination of primers and top coats in this color that
they would recommend?  Thanks again!
