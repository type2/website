is the singlecab that Clara &amp; I were trying to buy. The guy has just 
installed a 1600 DP engine. But Lo &amp; behold it has gate bumpers.
It has 25 mm or small bumpers at the back &amp; front &amp; back on the gates, with a 
small 25 mm bumper below at the back. The pictures might show, but I will 
take better ones if you want!
