I have these in stock also, but do not sell them as they are a very bad copy
of an early workshop manual. My supplier told me that these 
are legal copies but are made on a copy machine. It would be better to have
someone make a copy of there's. it would probally be a much cleaner and
legalable copie.

Hi list,
