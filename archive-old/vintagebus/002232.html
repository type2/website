Hello, I have never posted to the list before but thats because I am a
wannabusser. Hopefully  that will change on wednesday when i plan to buy a
67 westy.
      I am only 15 and have dreamed for a long time about owning a bus, and
I have recently started reading 'The Sermons of Bob Hoover&quot; these sermons
have helped me in various ways learn the many responsibilities of owning a
bus, and restoring to as close to stock as I can get it.  I don't feel Mr.
Hoover should be bashed for providing a service that he gives away to so
many people and expects nothing in return.  Well that was my two cents.
Thank You.
Bryan Dean
67 westy(well maybe)
