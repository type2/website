Subject: RE: [VB] gas tank resto  varnish/sludge

I had a tank steam cleaned to preserve the OE paint and make it easier
to do, plus I was scared of sand in the fuel system. The tank was
SOLIDLY filled half way with sheer GOOP, and this worked. Sat with  a
full tank since 1991. I removed the fuel line, and the tank didn't
empty, a stream of goop came out instead. It was so bad I thought the
tank was empty, until WHOOOSH, a bunch of super evil asphalt destroying
quasi gas came out.
Try a local radiator shop for a sever steam bath, cost me 60.00, and
they redcoated it for free. I was a little upset about thye coating,
fearing it would peel and clog, but so far so good. This was ona 72
fasty.

Finally made time to work on getting the 57 on the road. It's been
sitting since 88 when it was driven down to one of the so cal shows and
back and had been parked for an unknown amount of time prior to 88. You
can smell the varnish when you open the tank. fuel resevrve switch was
completely clogged and gummed up to the point that I had to remove it to
drain the tank. Looking at the por-15 kit they claim their chemicals
will clean this out but the hot rod guys I've talked to say nothing will
and I should have it sand blasted inside. Anyone have hands on
experience with cleaning out a tank with 10-15 years of varnish build
up? Using this product or any
other?http://www.por15_dot_com/tankseal_fuelpreserve.html
