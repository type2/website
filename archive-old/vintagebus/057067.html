&gt; Thanks for the advice Matt.  People usually don't buy a fire extinguisher
&gt; for their car until they have already had a fire.

&gt; While we're on the subject, does anyone know if a fire extinguisher needs to
&gt; be recharged or whatever they do to them?  Does the stuff in them go bad?

Dry chemical extinguishers need to be recharged every two or three years.
Take them out of their bracket now and then and give them an inverted
shake to keep the powder loose.
