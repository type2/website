&lt;&lt; So I seem to be missing a hole in my engine tin for the tube that goes from
 my oil bath air cleaner - I'm inclined to just drill a hole, I'd guess its
 roughly 1 inch.  Does this seem right, that is, that my tin could be missing
 a hole?  And is there anything to be concerned about re drilling through the
 tin?
  &gt;

well there are a number of version of rear tins for upright motors, and 
rarely do you somehow get the original case and tin with the car, ACtuallu, 
maybe they didn't even have preheat then, and you probably dont have the 
bastard 40hp motor anyway, (they tended to self destruct).   You are probably 
hoping to find one with a small hole on the left?   I have also used a 67 bug 
tin with two small holes and just blocked of the one I dont want.  Pre heat 
is not so important in the summer, unless you outside temps are wet and 
chilly, so maybe find one at a swap?  

some people do want the 1500 rear tin w/o holes, I e if they are setting up 
the preheat with the tube running through the front tin to the heaterbox, or 
if they are running dual carbs w/o preheat.
