Subject: Re: [VB] hump back seat?

My '61 Flip Seat has a humpback (I prefer to think of
it as scalloped) seat back.  Can't remember if Jon's
was or not, but the build dates on his and mine were
only six days apart.

&gt; Hi Clara,
&gt; If that is Shawn of Tacoma to whom you are refering
&gt; to.  We saw his Flip-seat 
&gt; this last weekend and it has the standard flat
&gt; Flip-seat upper back section.
