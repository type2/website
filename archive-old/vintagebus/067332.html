Subject: re:heaters

was writ:
&quot;Now a SouthWind or Eberspracher is putting out nice dry heat.  You split
the gas line so that you have one for the gas heater and you have to run
your exhaust out also.&quot;

what do you mean you need to run the exhaust out also? DO you mean you need
to exhaust the heater out of the bus? Do you put the heater in the engine
compartment, or inside the bus, and how would you exhaust from either
location?

now back to the procat/black cat option-these things look tippy...do you
guys make some contraption to keep from tipping over? The procat looks a
little nicer designed, but the internet sites i have seen it on do not show
a tank attached to it...
