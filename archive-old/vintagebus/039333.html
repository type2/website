My daughter and I went to the bug-in at ennis, tx early this month and 
camped out at a lake near the racetrack with some vintagevw list members.  
We just happen to meet JP Henrikse who had driven his '61 from Albequrque. 
We had a great time sitting around the campfire and telling stories.  JP 
brought his own firewood on the top of his bus.
I got re-motivated after visiting with JP for a few days and started looking 
for a split window bus.  Last week I went and picked up a '67 kombi that was 
stripped out and plan on making it into a camper.  I had a 69 hardtop westy 
that I had to sell when we moved last year and have been driving my 66 bug.  
I really missed having a camper.

I'm assuming that Bentley is the manual to have. After searching the web 
mostly all I found was &quot;workshop manual 63-67 type 2&quot;.  Is this the best one 
to have? Can I get it anywhere cheaper than $99.95?  Anyone have an old beat 
up copy that they would consider selling for a reasonable price?

Thanks,
Wayne Carlisle
Garland, Texas
