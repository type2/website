Subject: RE: [VB] King Pin rebuild help is needed...

That one looks pretty decent for home made, and looks
well loved.

If anyone is interested, pics of the factory VW tools
are here:

http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~hazetguy/tools

There is a pic of the reamer for the bushings, the
&quot;taker-aparter&quot; tool for pressing them apart (VW460),
and the jig with various spacers (some are factory,
others I had made for various linkpins) for pressing
them back together in alignmentand that is tool
VW461/1.

&gt; It's a bit agricultural but its popped a LOT
&gt; of kingpins. Takes about a minute to make.
