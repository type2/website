When I bought the rack, it was shipped in pieces.  The
aluminum rails were toast.  I couldn't find replacements,
but I did find steel tubes of the right diameter.  Within
a short while, they rusted, and they look like crap.  I'm
sure I'm having galvanic corrosion issues as well, of
which I'm not yet aware.

&gt; why no steel?
