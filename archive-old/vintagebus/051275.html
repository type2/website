&gt; Just out of curiousity, how much further does the reserve take you? Has
&gt; anyone tried to find out the limit? 

Hi Alex,
About 20 miles in our 1960 panel camper conversion.  We have modified the 
fuel tap by cutting off the reserve tube to rid the tank of water trapped in 
it which causes the tank to rust out next to the reserve.  We figure drianing 
the carburetor is alot easier.
