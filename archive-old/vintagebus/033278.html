Subject: 63 truck m codes
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

sorry I lost the original post, but my computer's modem is on strike in sympathy to the 600 WTO protesters still in jail in Seattle, so I am using a friend's which I am unfamilar with,

Anyway, M code 195 afaik is a mystery.  I saw it on a 62 walk through standard.  In the NEATO survey that Dave Easterwood compiled (check NEATO webpage)is was generally found in 62s or 63s, and about half of thevehicles who had is were trucks, but I could havethat number off.

Re the rear axles, trucks did not come with different ones.  But you have the 1500motor/1 ton suspension package.  which mean that your truck came with the option in one year only rear stub axles and drums- the stub axles are longer and the drums wider than 63 regular drums, you use the same brake pads as a 64-67, and still have the 36mm axle nut.  That is, IF you have the original axles on there.

hope this helps

oh, you interior colour is not on the tag, as there is a interior that comes with 63 white commercial vehicles, that grey vinyl seats (forget what kind of piping), grey hardboard panelling, black steering wheel, black knobs at dash, grab handle light grey-more of a white with black ends, light grey vinyl sunvisors, black floor mat
