How about buying ALL the Parts, and then buying the shell as another
part..... ?? Kind of a tough way to go, however if this is going to be a
restoration anyway.....

Good luck.

&gt; Is it in California? If yes, and if it was towed under
&gt; the abatement law then they can only sell parts off
&gt; it. The Calif abatement law specifically says that the
&gt; vehicle can only be parted out and then crushed.
&gt; 
&gt; Other states may have the style of laws on their
&gt; books.
