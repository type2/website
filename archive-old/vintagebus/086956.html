Subject: Re: [VB] Trip report, vapor lock

Tom,

One more piece of info. I don't have a tach, but calculating RPM's with tire 
dia. and gear ratios gives me about 3665 RPM at 70mph. With my old set up, 
standard trans (about 3900 rpm at 70) and a 1600 dp with same carb and an 
extractor exhaust with quiet pack, the oil would turn kinda black over an 
800  mile run.

PS. I am running a 1776 with a weber progressive carb and standard
pea shooter exhaust. Considering going back to the extractor and
quiet pack. Ran 65-70mph all the way, except going up hills. Oil
only turned a light brown. The dog house cooler must be doing a
good job.
What gearing do you have in the tranny?

I have a 63 DC w/ 1776  w/ kadrons/magnaflow exhaust &amp; at those
speeds, I overheat according to my tach/touch the dipstick tests.
