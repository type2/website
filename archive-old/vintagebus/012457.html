Hi all,

Just thought I'd drop by with another fun tidbit of Transporter Trivia
gleaned out of a 1959 Factory Transporter Service manual (with updates to
4/'63).  Man, this stuff's cool!  I bet you're dying with anticipation! 
Let's go, shall we?

&gt;From Chassis No. 652 226 (9th September 1960), the wooden slats on the
loading platform of the pick-up models are secured with Pop rivets. (I
snipped the detailed description of a pop rivet and how they work).  When
carrying out repairs, the slats can be secured with pop rivets if the
special pliers are available or with ordinary galvanized cheese head B Z 
4.8 x 16 mm tapping screws with slots DIN 7971.  When the slats are secured
with screws, a sealing strip must be placed between the slat and body.  A
suitable sealing strip is produced by Messrs. Dekalin, Deutsche
Klebstoffwerke Rodiger und Sohn GmbH., Hanau a. M., Bruchkobeler
Landstrasse 75-87 under the designation Type A 2.

Pretty cool huh?  I believe this has been discussed before, but now we know
exactly when VW switched from screws to rivets on the slats of all
pick-ups.

Oh hell, how about one more about the Single Cab pick-ups?  And away we go!

&gt;From Chassis No. 971 550 (Aug 1962 - beginning of the 1963 model), on
models 261, 263, and 264 the spare wheel is now suspended in the locker
under the platform. 
 
A spare wheel retainer - Part No. 261 801 897 - and support bracket - Part
No. 261 801 895 - prevent the spare wheel from moving and facilitate it's
removal and repositioning.

Service installation of the spare wheel mounting in previous type vehicles
is not possible.

Well, that's probably enough for now.  I've got loads of this stuff to
share.  I'll keep dropping by with more &quot;Anal Transporter Trivia&quot; every now
and then if you want me to.

Ta Ta for now,

Bill Bowman

P.S.   Someone mentioned that the new issue of VW  Trends has event
coverage of the &quot;1998 Busses By the Arch&quot; event I host in it newest issue. 
Can anyone confirm this?  Also, is there a photo of me in a cow suit
anywhere in there? Oh Boy!?  By the way, those planning on joining us for
the &quot;1999 Busses By the Arch&quot; Transporter weekend, I've arranged for an
awesome new, private location at a beautiful Corp of Enginneers group
campground, &quot;bitchen&quot; facilities, HUGE upgrade, right on a huge lake 2
hours from St. Louis.  Details to follow!

P.S.   Can anyone tell me if there is a e-mail list for Type 181 Thing
enthusiasts and provide me privately (off-list) with it's address?  Thanks.
