Ive been told that as an accesory speakers were mounted in the rear corners.
See those little round holes in the corners?
Not sure what truth there is to this but my 60 deluxe had the same set-up.

&lt;&lt; We're about to install a headliner in our '58 23 window, and want to make

Does anyone have information on what the two wires that go to the very back
are for? These go beyond the positive wire for the rear domelight. Thanks.
