I agree!  The people I've helped (with no reservation BTW) had never even heard of the AIRS site!  They had just been handed the print out of people by others along the way.  Two out of the three couldn’t have mechanically helped anyone else on the list since they didn't know a distributor cap from a gas cap.  Let alone have tools or supplies.

It might be a good idea for the Site to carry a message that states that
if you are not on the AIRS list you shouldn't expect to get any assistance
from the AIRS members.
