Subject: Hubcap paint code

Does anyone know what the paint code (name or
anything) for the commercial hubcaps would be? 
Wolfsburg West says L345, but I don't think so,
according to other sources.  I can't find this in the
archives.  It may be the same paint as the interior of
commercial busses, but, again I can't find it. 
Thanks,

JP
