Don't be so sure that it is a hack.  There were factory ordered display busses
that had a VERY large glass window installed in the side of a panel van.  You
need to look closely and look at the codes.

&gt;
&gt; all....we decide to drive around to the back and that one straight panel has
&gt; this huge window like you see on modern full size conversion vans...like 2
&gt; foot wide and 3.5 to 4 ft long.....cut in about 5 tenths past the drivers
&gt; door...man what a hack...this bus was perfect besides that..but oh well, I'll
&gt; check on it anyways.
