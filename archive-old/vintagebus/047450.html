Hi all,

I have to ask this question because the moron mechanic replacing my
transmission
won't bother to.  

I have 1964 Sundial that was converted to 12 volts by PO (still had 6 volt
starter)  I just ordered a rebuilt transmission and am having it installed by
a local guy who used to do VW work years ago.  Anyway he tells me the rebuilt
trans is from a '67 Bug and he had to put in a 12 volt starter because the old
6 volt wouldnt fit in the trans properly.  OK my question:

I would suppose it still had the 6 volt flywheel.  Problem, right?  He says
no, he's done it many times without any trouble.  Then he says it looked like
the flywheel was a 12 volt anyway.  Wait a minute,  LOOKED like a 12 volt
flywheel? Doesn't this decide the clutch size too?  For the starter concern,
he said that if it made me feel better, there was a bushing that allowed one
to use a 6 volt starter with a later transmission.  OK great he'll put it in
for me-but what about the flywheel-clutch thing?  Maybe PO was running a 6
volt starter with a 12 volt flywheel?  No grinding or problems with starting
prior to this though. Then I hear some buses used a 6 volt flywheel that was
the same size as the 12 volt  HELP!

Thanks for your patience,

Jeff
