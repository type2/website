&gt;Looks nice Bob but I'm afraid for your color sand job to get the overspray 
&gt;off the roof.

ahhhh, i wondered if anyone would mention that... my friend has this stuff 
called &quot;Magic Mask&quot;. he applies it through his gun ALL over the areas where 
you DON'T want paint to stick. after it dries (3 minutes) you can spray 
away. its like a film, if you rub it, it curls upp like a boogar. (sp?) when 
finished you hose it off and it turns into soap. then you can wash the car 
off! i didnt have time to wash it off last night, late night... i can barely 
see out the side windows, the're cloudy :)
later,
