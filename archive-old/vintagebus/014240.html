 I believe in the same thing.... Had the B*g for sale
for only $2500.... wont go into what I had in it money
wise, or the trustworthyness of it. The only folks
that did come by were more interested in the Ch*vy
truck or the S/C..... Ive got the double barrel 10
guage out.... let the &quot;Grinch who stole VW's&quot; come by
my house...
 On a lighter note... does anyone have bulb numbers
indexed for a 6V to 12V swap? Gettin ready to do ALL
of em, &amp; instead of takin the bulbs in to tell em &quot;I
need a 12V bulb like this&quot;, I can just give em a
number....
 Thanks,
