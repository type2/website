&gt;Subject: Auburn Hills show  also Effingham iL. May 22
&gt;Date: Sat, 8 May 1999 20:43:42 &gt;
&gt;Hi All.
&gt;I am hoping to go to the Auburn Hills Vintage V W show Friday May 14th. I
&gt;may not leave until early sat may 15 (like 6am) so I get to the show for
&gt;noon.
&gt;I have a few Q? that I was hoping you could help me out with.
&gt;Is there anyone else that is going?  Are you passing by Cambridge Ontario,
&gt;or would I be passing by your house? Do you want to Cara&quot;bus&quot;?
&gt;I am planning to travel the 401 to London On, then the 402 to Sarnia / Port
&gt;Huron MI. Then I-94 to SR-59 to pontiac. 3800_Hamlin_Rd
&gt;If you are, let me now and we can meet somewhere.
&gt;Other's that are going and would like to meet up at the show, get back to
&gt;me about the when,&amp; where, details thanks. If you see my Westy, please drop
&gt;in and say Hello.  http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/74westy.htm
&gt;Is there anyone in the vicinity of the show that would have a place I could
&gt;park my Westfalia Camper Fri and Sat night? or know of a campsite in the
&gt;area? This would be extremely helpful.

&gt;May 22, 1999 Effingham, Illinois on Saturday, 'BUGFEST '99' VOLKSWAGEN
&gt;CELEBRATION
&gt;All the same Q's as above , I will be travelling the 401 to Detroit, I-75
&gt;to Dayton,  I-70 west to Effingham.
&gt;Is there anyone along this route that would like to cara&quot;bus&quot; ?
&gt;I will probably be leaving Cambridge on. about 8 pm fri may 21 and
&gt;travelling the 10 hrs to get to the show for about 7 am sat morning, then I
&gt;would probably campout somewhere close or on the way home.
&gt;Are you passing by Cambridge Ontario, or would I be passing by your house?
&gt;Would you like to ride along, share the gas money......
&gt;If you are, let me now and we can meet somewhere.
&gt;Other's that are going and would like to meet up at the show, get back to
&gt;me about the when,&amp; where, details thanks. If you see my Westy, please drop
&gt;in and say Hello.  http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/74westy.htm
&gt;
&gt;Ps... pass this on to whomever i forgot ...  thanks
