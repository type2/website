Baiting me, Rusty one? I heard you bought new windows when they got dirty. I
know you replace transmissions and engines just because they're due for oil
changes. 8^) Lots of dirty engines, transmissions and windows at the
VanBondo Ranch, I even heard he had a milk crate full of distributors that
need the points set and carbs with dirty fuel filters attached. He got rid
of the Buick cause the ashtray was full...
