If it's NOS, it should be in superb condition, and will be a dull grey color;
it might even have the part number written on it, or a sticker.  Look for signs
of use, such as ovalling in the bolt holes, and marring on the inside from 
the brackets.

&gt; Question for you VW fans. How can I say if the bumper I have is NOS or not?
&gt; Is there any stampings on the inside or perhaps numbers?
