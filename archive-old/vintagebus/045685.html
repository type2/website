 I'm wanting to cut an emergency brake cable. What tool
 can I use to do 
 this?
 
 -----------
 Double check the replacement costs for brake cables
 prior to casually cutting them!!! Big nutter ebrake
 cables can be spendy! You'd think that they should be
 butt cheap but some of them are not.
 Ebrake and clutch cable losening etc? At least try a
 pair of needle nose style vice grips. Call me crazy,
 MAC on me for not seeing who is the orginator of
 inconsequential emails but at least give me the credit
 for trying to prevent you from making mistakes that
 have cost me money in the past...

 Die grind the retaining nut(s) in half and discarding
 them prior to ruining a potentially expensive ecable.
  &gt;&gt;
I'd second that ellis.  Why  not remove the cable rather than cutting it?  

I have gotten ebrake cables out of junkyard buses, especially the 59 and 
earlier kind- as I would rather not pay the $70 a cable
