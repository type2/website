&lt;&lt; First, I drained and refilled the RGB's and tranny.  Now both boxes are 
leaking from what looks like behind the spring plates&gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Dissassemble, inspect all the bearings, and other parts.  Replace the outer 
axle seals.  Then seal the inner plugs against the spring plates with high 
temp silicon sealant.  

&lt;&lt;Secondly, how do I remove clutch arm off the piviot shaft?  Do I need a 
puller?  I removed the circlip but it won't come off.&gt;&gt;
Should come off with the C-clip removed.  If not then it is either rusted on 
due to not being greased well when installed, or someone beat it on and has 
mushroomed the shaft.  Either one probably means cuttin the throw out arm 
inside of the tranny bell housing.

&lt;&lt; While I have it off should I reinforce the arms by welding them up?&gt;&gt;
Most definitely, unless you enjoy removing the engine, and replacing the 
throw out arm often.  
 
&lt;&lt;Thirdly,  Is it good insurance to replace the tranny input shaft seal?  
This bus has been sitting with out a motor for years and has massive amounts 
of dirt in the bell housing.  The shaft and seal seem fine, but I don't want 
to have to take the motor out to fix something I should have done in the 
first place. &gt;&gt;
Probably a good idea to replace it.  How were the axle tube boots?
 
&lt;&lt;Lastly, this 67 does not have back up lights.  Does that mean it is a early 
67?? &gt;&gt;
Probably!  Eric&amp;Barb
