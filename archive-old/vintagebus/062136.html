Subject: July 20th-NW Vintage Meet

If you are making your summer plans...
 
The 21st annual Vintage Meet is Sat July 20th this year.  Again at Shoreline Commmunity College (exit 175 from I-5 in Seattle).  It's $5 a head to get in (think kids 12&amp; under are free), $5 to show a car.
     This is the actual real date, just in case Hot VWs screws up their calender like they did last year.
