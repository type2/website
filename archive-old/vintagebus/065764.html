Subject: If you believe in Santa...DON'T READ!!!

My wife told me there is a 5-pack of &quot;Sponge Bob&quot; matchbox cars with a VW 
Panel bus in it. She said the local Wally World had tons of 'em. 
Unfortunatly for me she accidentily put mine on lay-away along with all the 
other gifts from &quot;Santa&quot;...so I havn't seen it and can't post a picture.

Anyway...thought I'd mention it.
