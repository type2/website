Dave, if it's just the crank shaft pin holes that are ovaled out the
best thing is to echange the crank because they are cheap. The next
thing you can do is to have the crank pin holes deep drilled. This is
not recommended but they do make extended pins for this. I have done it
for hard to replace stroked cranks and dune buggy/sandrail engines and
retorqued to 300 lbs. If it's just your flywheel I'd replace the
flywheel. There is also the option to oversize to the next larger pin,
but this makes the crank an unwanted core in many places.

I pulled the engine and found the flywheel was loose! It wobbled on the
end of the crankshaft &quot;just a little&quot;.  The end play was .009&quot; with all
3 shims installed.

I found that the 4 pins in the end of the crankshaft wiggled just a
little. So I am advised that the crankshaft and flywheel needs to be
replaced. I am disappointed and hope to learn from this situation all
that I can so it won't happen again.

My plan at this point is to replace the flywheel and crankshaft.
Everything else is almost new.

Wishing I could just build an engine that would last 50,000 miles.

Any opinions, reactions, or advice is requested.

Dave
