Subject: Minor question about head work...
Date: Tue, 11 Jan 2000 20:39:10 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a simple question about the work I had done on my heads for my 1776
engine.  First of all, I want to say that I've befriended the machinist who
has been helping me with this project.  He's a super nice guy and I'm
looking forward to the friendship between us.  I would just like some input
from a few more people since this is a first for me...

When I had the heads opened up, the mating surface where the cylinder
touches the head on one head is completely flush whereas the second head has
about a 3 to 4 thousands of an inch step from the original bore to the new
bore.  My question is will this affect the sealing or make any difference
with the mating of the new cylinder to the head?  The machinist set the
depth and did all 4 cylinders the same so there is obviously a slight
difference between the heads and NOT the tooling.  I will be checking my
compression anyway and will be able to compensate if there is a problem but
does anyone think this will hurt anything?  Everything _looks_ good to me
right now but will it work this way?

Thanks!
