Hi list,

I found an article in the library which I found most interesting. It is by
Brian Verbeek and may be found at
http://vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com/library/mainten/qvalve.htm It describes a method
of valve adjustment with which I am unfamiliar. Could Brian or anyone who
has used this method have a crack at explaining it in a little more detail.

Also, when a hydraulic valve conversion is done on a type 1 motor would the
appropriate parts from a type 4 be used or are they type 1 specific
aftermarket bits?

Later

Michael
