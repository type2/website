 Hi Tim,
 The problem with the type 1 front and rear windows is that any water that 
 leaks by the seal to body ends up dripping through the factory zinc primer 
 bath drain holes in the body/window channels.  We found this out years ago 
 after moving back to Washinton state with my 1963 KG that I had found, and 
 restored during my years in the USAF while based in Texas.  Suddenly the 
 floor of the KG was always damp.  Turns out once the water leaks past the 
 seal and down through the primer bath drain holes it works it's way down in 
 front of the door hindge pillars and sits until it either fills up till it 
 seeps out around the lower hindge screws or works it's way into the heater 
 channels, and to the floor inside.  Rotting the type 1 from the inside of 
the 
 heater channels out, and fogging your windshield!  Thus the start of our 
 experience with seals and sealant.     Eric&amp;Barb

I think many people dont realise the difference in humidity in certain areas. 
  I brought a 70 westy from the bay area to W WA , sodl it to a guy here, a 
year later he remarked how he could visably see it rusting ....in a year.

my 69 beetle never leaked water till I moved to Oly.   Suddenly the 
windsheilds fogged up whenever I had the heat on- the defogger had become an 
refogger due to water seeping past the seal and into the heater vents at the 
corner of the windscreen.   The original seals were no longer good.  I pulled 
the windscreen out and there was no rust under neath, not a bubble under the 
paint.   cleaned it up (lots of dirt) and put the new seal on the glass and 
put the glass back in with roofing tar.

People with old buses develop a wierd facination with sealing the bus to keep 
water out, and making the heat work to dry the bus out as much as possible.  
The difference is the wet is constant.   Maybe it will dry up for a week in 
the summer, maybe.   Many other places it dry up between rainy days.   Some 
places there is dry dust on the ground. This is a very hard concept to really 
grasp.  Yes initially it seems simple, but the actuallity is different.  Kind 
of like people who think tall trees dont grow on flat ground, that forests 
are in the mountains.  That is true in some places.  What it means on a day 
to day basis driving an old bus- you think it's normal to have holes in the 
front floor etc.   water getting past the seals and rusting the window ledge 
will happen.  It will not dry out under there.   Once water gets under the 
seal 

it will stay wet under there forever, 

or until the bus is moved to a dry environment.  
and new seals do not seal against rust pits.   tar does help prevent rust.  
It even smells good... mm mm...tar!

I don't know why people are so afraid of roofing tar.  it is not scary.  It 
does not hide under the bed at night waiting to jump out and get you.    It 
is cheap and effective, and easy to clean up- just use wd40 and rags.    I 
expect the people who didn't want to clean up after roofing tar must have 
immaculatly clean engines, so they don't get their hands dirty on the bus 
even doing a tuneup.
