Hey John,

Of course you're right, OCTO is a NEATO chapter. I've gotta say that Dave
is one of the more apolitcal people in the hobby. I'm sure it was an
oversight. In fact I know that he was planning on attending BBB, but can't,
due to unfortunate circumstances.

I agree that BBB is one of the most fun events on the circuit. That's why
I'm making sure to be there this year. It will certainly get coverage in
the SV2s newsletter and hopefully next year the magazines will attend too!

Also, just for the record...SV2s certainly considers itself a national bus
organization too! :)

&gt;organization. And I thought OCTO was a CHAPTER OF NEATO !!! Oh well. Maybe
&gt;this is why BBB and Jerome never get any press as well as the many great bus
&gt;shows each year. We do have a great time though. See all of you I hope at
&gt;BBB this weekend. Just my thoughts, No offence to STV's , soto or octo.
