&gt;Incidently, when trying to get the starter to turn, a voltmeter

&gt;the starter was turned on (but wasn't working), this dropped to
&gt;next to nothing. A guy in a electrical shop told me this
&gt;indicates the starter is bad.

I have to disagree with the this,, assuming that the starter motor isn't
completely stuck and won't turn ,,, then a good , fully charged 6 V battery
should not drop below 4.5 volts for at least 1 minute at room temperature,,
now, those are my figures,, I am not sure of the exact data,,
But what I am trying to say, is *I* think from what you have said,, the
Battery has no Reserve left..bad battery
A lead acid battery has approx 2.4 volts per cell.. that is why a 12 volt
battery is fully charged at 13.8 - 14.4 volts
A 6 volt is the same..2.4v/cell .... it should be 6.9 to 7.2 volts... and
load tested it will not fall much below 5 volts
Road to a solution......
Try and get a charger that has a BOOST output ,, and connect it to the
battery in the Bus,,, and then hit the Key!
If it turns over, it proves the battery has no uumph left in it.
barring that....,, boost the car with a 12 volt battery....YMMV,
If it turns over real fast,, then you know the battery is bad!

I'd like to chime in on the ANSWER to Mark's problem..

Nope, not entirely correct (the part about the cell voltage and the common
&quot;load test&quot;).  The cells will be 2.4v apiece under light operating conditions,
but if a complete (read: zero ohm or &quot;big fat piece of well connected metal)
short is applied to a battery, it will get to damn near 0 volts -- because....
batteries have something called &quot;internal resistance&quot;.  The battery itself
starts acting like a resistor.  Because of this, and assuming that the battery
has a complete (zero ohm) short on it, the cells will never reach 0v but will
come close.  Looking at the assumed shorted out starter, this is far from zero
ohms.  The &quot;dynamic&quot; resistance wil read differently from a static resistance,
i.e. measured cold, without power applied to it - with a standard ohmmeter
(which might in fact read zero ohms).  So the story gets complicated - a
battery that has variable potential (voltage) with the variation depending on
how much of a load you put on it, a shunt (in this case a shorted starter) of
a non-zero ohm value and alas the added variable of heat which changes this
shunt (heated wires gain resistance).

The point being that a strong battery can reach near 0v with a true zero ohm
shunt.  Probably won't reach too near that though, with a bad starter - and
shouldn't with a common load tester (it has resistance and a meter calibrated
to that resistance so that the readings will be of use to the mechanic.)  

But yes, the battery booster test should tell all about that battery oomph.
