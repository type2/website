Hey Kabayo, and list administrators,

May I speak frankly?  I'm also one of those listees who is kinda sick and
tired of reading all of the Ebay posts on this list.  This weakly related
stuff is consuming more and more of our time, making the Vintagebus List a
little less and less valuable all the time.  If we want to know about
what's goin' on over there, all of us can easily go there to look for
ourselves.  This list is about Bus issues and help, and the Ebay stuff is
wasting a lot of our time and the Lists bandwith.  If we're collecting
comments here, I personally wish all the Ebay related sh%t would be
banished.  Let's get back to pure Bus related conversations, not Bus or VW
parts on auction site.

I should shut up now, but I might as well say one more thing.  Other than
the Ebay stuff, I find Kabayo's other posts are of value and usually
entertaining.  But.....  Kabayo, is there any chance you'd please consider
deleting that stupid political header at the end of your messages?  That
truely has absolutely nothing to do with this list, and many of us don't
really appreciate being preached to about non-Bus related, political crap. 
Please consider the rest of us and drop that header in the future.  

Okay, I've finally come out and said it, so thanks for listening and trying
to understand another point of view.
