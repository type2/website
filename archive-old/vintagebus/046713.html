Subject: I love Rancho!!!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


My buddy and I just finished installing my new transmission from Rancho.  I 
ordered it redux box to redux box (Big nut).  It has a 3.44 R&amp;P, welded 3rd &amp; 
4th, and a few other extras.  Yes, I spent a bit of money on it but after the 
maiden voyage I can say it was well worth the expense.  I am extremely 
satisfied thus far.  It is everything I had hoped it would be.  I let my 
buddy drive it and he is planning on ordering the same set up next week.

70mph at 3800 rpm vs. 55mph at 4000 rpm with the old tranny.  8-)  

Updating brakes as well...

I'll post more as time goes by if anyone is interested.
