Subject: Re: [VB] New Steering wheels

Pimppride is ISPWest's handle on e-Baysplit. They have a lot of neat stuff
but, shamefully overpriced. I would price them at other places first.

| I need to do something about my steering wheel.  I see someone on ebay (
| Goes by the name Pimp Pride) selling repros for $189.  Has anybody bought
| one of these, if so, how did you like it?  Mine is not so bad that it
could
| not be repaired, bit that seems to cost more than a new one.  Any
| suggestions ?
