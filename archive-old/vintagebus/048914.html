On a lighter note, I'm getting real close on the cupholders.  I think they're looking pretty cool.  Color choices are black, red and blue.  I was just going to do black thinking the other colors might look kinda sh*tty against bus colors.  Any feedback on this would be appreciated.

Sam (sglw_at_aol_dot_com) has graciously offered his webpage for setting up a pic of the cupholder.  As soon as it's ready I'll post the info.

Robert
