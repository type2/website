I was told that the bearing prices for the reduction boxes were very
expensive and hard to find.  However I easily found FAG bearings locally
for a reasonable price.   Here is what I found:
     #6306 - (3 needed/side) $15 / each
     #6305 - (1 needed/side) $11 / each

These should work for my '59 bus. Right?
