I came across this link,
http://www.sherwin_dot_com/productsservices/default.asp (don't
go to www.Sherwi_dot_com, huge &amp; useless front page) and found
info about paints, general and specific. Somewhere in there
is a list of industrial coatings, the automotive section is
good too. Full specs on all of it in Acrobat reader.

'63 DC is actually in my driveway, fresh RAL2000 paint. Will
post pics soon. Need a passenger side door handle (flip out
type) and seat 'bumpers' for front and back. Also need the
rest of my shipment from the Bus Depot. Hope to complete it
for the SoCal Classic weekend while it's shiny and before it
becomes just a truck.
