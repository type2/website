Subject: Progressive Carb problems

How do I adjust this thing?  I dl'd the manual, but mine looks different.  
It idles way to fast and when you give it some gas is bogs down, so it's 
running to rich right?  Well I can't really see between the shroud and 
carburator anyone have pictures I can reference?  Where is the mixture 
screw?

Also- www.sundial-camper_dot_com is back online
