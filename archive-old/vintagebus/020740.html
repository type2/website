Subject: Polishing Aluminum

I held back on this thread for a day or two...

OK, my experience with polishing aluminum on two
busses and a trailer is that in the end the best
solution is to take your aluminum pieces to a
professional polisher.

A friend of the family does a lot of polishing for the
custom Harley crowd. He has commercial grade high
speed  grinding wheels fitted with various buffing
wheels and uses a series of compounds and cleaning
solutions.
He also used gloves, big time OSHA appropriate eye
goggles and a heavy duty breathing filtering mask to
prevent silicosis or any similar damage to his lungs
while using the high speed equipment and misc.
polishing compounds.

&lt;PROTECT YOUR LUNGS and EYES!&gt;

I spent a zillion hours using steel wool, Mother's
polish, Semi-chrome, Never-dull batting wool, a home
drill and still did not achieve what the pro did in
record time. If your time is worth anything I would go
the pro route. The money spent will allow you to
either accomplish other things or earn the money to
pay for the polishing. Use your head and other talents
unless you have time to burn and the right equipment. 
My thought is that as a project manager of my
hypothetical restoration it is wise to recognize that
I/you cannot be the best source for *ALL* skills. A
good manager will know when to use other craftspersons
and who they are.
Of course, there will be the alpha-doggian type
detractors out there who will disagree trying to prove
that their manhood &lt;sorry, Clara/Lois G.&gt; is bigger
than the other guy and *has* to do everything from
smeltering their own iron ore, refining their own
petroleum products to formulating their own paint.
Give it a rest. You won't be using your manhood to
polish the aluminum. Keep it in your pants while
operating high speed equipment!
If you desire the &quot;chrome&quot; appearance then I say cut
the crap and don't cheap out on such of a potentially
critical step. Look in the phone book under polishing
or seek out opinions from various custom Harley
builders as to who has the best rep in your area.
-------------------
On the other hand, (I've said this before) the super
chrome appearance is not stock for camper windows and
if you are attempting OG &quot;restoration&quot; then great
results might be achieved at home. My window frames
were bent and had reptilian crackle texture to them
due to severe weathering. Personally it made no sense
to me to spend the time and money doing up all other
aspects of the '67camper project and installing messed
up-less than optimum windows. Pro polishing will
eventually dull down slightly and be great. Don't ever
use any lemon based products or mag wheel cleaner on
previously polished aluminum.

Good luck
