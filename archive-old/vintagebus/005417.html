Saturday I went out to Walmart to look for the bus/beetle combo that  has so
far been hard for me to find.  I came home empty handed. :-(

Later I hooked up with Rob via net meeting and we chatted about the elusive
combo.  Kevin Sullivan (mutual friend of ours) had tried one Walmart 4
different times in the morning before he finally found one.  This is due to
backstock and trucks bringing new supplies daily at the 24 hour
installations.

Anyway, I went out again today about 12:30 and it looked like nobody had
even touched the stash - the boxes were left just how I had found them.  Rob
had reminded me to look on the high shelves where they have the &quot;ask clerk
for assistance&quot; tags.  I'm 6'3&quot; so I can reach that stuff without help.  I
saw about 4 or 5 more Road &amp; Track Show Stopper combos but they were simply
repeats except 2.  Once was an orange Dodge Viper with an Orange pickup
towing it.  The very last box I looked at was tipped over on it's back and
barely sticking out.  I took a good look from about 5 feet away and
recognized the roofline of the bus.  BINGO!  I pulled it down by standing on
my toes and snagging it with my index finger.  That was the only one they
had and I have a hunch it was there yesterday too when I was looking for
it - I just didn't look &quot;UP.&quot;

At $13.80 it was a steal - you get 2 die-cast models of vintage VWs with one
being a split-window bus.

Thanks to Rob for the tip and thanks to Rob for emailing me and telling me
he found one and bought it for me.  Does this mean I get to have 2 of them
Rob? :-)

TTYL!
