Also called &quot;electrical contact/parts cleaner&quot;.  Basically spray solvent.  
Test it before using near plastic.  Should be okay on the little turn signal 
switch circuit board, but I would test it anyway.  There are plastic safe 
types, not that there is much plastic on a bus.

The problem I have with this stuff is that it cleans dirt, grease, oil, 
etc... but does little to actually remove the layer of oxidized/tarnished 
copper.  Oxidized metal is not a good conductor as it flunked out of 
hindergarten and won't share its electrons.  Highly technical.

I respectfully decent from Eric and Barb's opinion and I would not use WD-40 
on electrical parts.  It may evaporate, but there is still residue IMHO.  

Never tried this conductive grease (half way down the page):

nor this at bottom of page:

Cool, silver lubricant.
