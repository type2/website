Subject: Bus Sunday in west TX.

Today listmember Jim Share drove from Abilene down to my house 
outside San Angelo in his '67 walk-thru Westy. He hung out all day 
and helped me work out the problem I was having with my engine. Turns 
out the distributor cap was toast. I ended up yanking the whole disty 
out and putting the 009 from my wife's car in. He helped me get it 
timed and now my engine is running good again. I'm gonna try and buy 
a new vaccume advance disty, but at least can keep driving for now.

Travis Pedigo, who lives in San Angelo and drives a '67 bus, came out 
to hang with us a little before Jim had to leave. He hopped right 
into the mess inside that old panel bus I brought home and started 
digging around for buried treasure. I made the mistake of telling him 
he could have anything he wanted from in there. Right after that he 
pulled out some old glass taillight lense from an american car. So I 
told him...&quot;well, maybe not anything&quot;. We compared greens on his and 
Jim's buses and then set out for the road.

We caravanned down the the highway to where Jim turned off and got a 
few honks and waves, along with a lot of attention.

I put some pictures up on our local club web-page here:
http://members2.boardhost_dot_com/cvve/msg/32.html  (make sure to wait 
for both pictures load)

I wanted to tell Jim thanks for the help. I don't get help that much 
living out in the sticks and it was nice. Can't wait to take a trek 
up to Abilene to visit him.

You know, we are trying to get a caravan together for the trip to 
Ennis, TX for the Bug-In on May 7th. The San Angelo guys will drive 
up to Abilene and we'll all drive down I-10 to Ennis. If any of you 
guys want to get in on it, email me. I imagine we'll be driving on 
Saturday and sleeping in Ennis overnight. Should be fun.

Oh yeh. Jim bought my Westy wood slat roof rack. I really hated to 
sell it. But I needed the money for a new welder and I have to say it 
looks a ton better on his bus than it does on mine. Here's a picture 
of it on his bus: http://type2guy.webjump_dot_com/jimshare/


See Ya!
