&gt; I am in Alberta and that does sound interesting.

Hi Mike,
We hope you are not much North of Calgary then!  That way it would not be too 
long of a drive.

 &gt;&gt;When is the show going to be. I saw the date on the internet recently but 
can not 
&gt; remember where.

It is on the 27 of April.  We posted info about the meet on Thom's 
vintagebus_dot_com website in the events area.

 Washinton is also one of my favorite states.&gt; 
&gt; 
One of our's also!  ;-)
Hopefully we will get to see you there.
Keep On VWing,
Eric&amp;Barb
