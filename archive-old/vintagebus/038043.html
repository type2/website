Subject: Rubber Mounts
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

What's the deal these days with the front tranny mounts?  I have gone through 
at least 4 in the last year or so.  I have asked around and a few people have 
stated that they are crap and that the rubber is not bonded to the metal 
properly.  This I thought was true of the ones which I purcased through my 
FLAPS (BAP) here in Phx.  Then I purchased a German one from Ronnie.  The 
mount looked great and the studs were the correct size.  The german ones use 
the normal 15mm nut as the others used a smaller stud making me have to use 
normal 13mm's.  Well that mount broke today.  It seperated at the bond just 
like the others.  A perfectly clean break between the rubber and metal.  I do 
live out in the boonies and the roads are real crappy but I wouldnt believe 
that they are bad enough to cause this, at least not this many times.  So 
right now I have a rubber piece from the middle of one of the old mounts 
placed between the tranny and rear crossmember.  So any ideas?
