Yeah, this happened to a friend of mine who saw a 53 deluxe at the classic a 
couple of years ago. He took some photos and looked at it real good because 
he knew he might be in the market for such a vehicle. Well, when the 
opportunity came, he purchased the vehicle but the poor bus came without a 
lot of the more desirable stuff. And the bitch of it is that when it came 
time to find these sort of parts, the only person who had them for sale was 
you know who, the original seller. Who knows if the owners who do this 
prorate the buses according to the value of certain parts/accessories? It 
should clearly be stated when for sale what is not included, before you start 
to even get happy thoughts in your mind.
