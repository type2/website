...99% of stuff VWOA put on a bus is actually
aftermarket...as these pieces were not manufactured by
VW or an OEM company.  In other words not put on at
the factory or factory aproved so to speak...so really
it is an aftermarket part in the purist sense ;-)

I have seen lots of those truck mirrors nos...made in
USA somewhere as most VWOA stuff was...most of the
VWOA stuff is pretty junky.  I will save that dudes
email as I now of a guy with a couple boxes of NOS
VWOA mirrors and other goofy junk.

VWOA stuff is kinda like comparing a westfalia to a
Sundial (it is friday right! HA HA!!)...there is just
no comparison :-) I can't wait for the non-westy
camper flamers now!!!

VIVA LA WIEDENBRUCK!!!!
