I just returned from the Barrett-Jackson auction.
Beautiful weather and tons of nice looking vehicles
and trophy wives.
Parked the '54 Barnambulator in the VIP lot to hope
and get some attn.

VW related:
I saw a *NASTY* peach and white 1967 21 window go
through the mill. I mean, embarrassingly fugly!
Sellers of the 21 said that they hoped to get &quot;in the
high 20's&quot; prior to the ramp drill. I spotted no less
than 30 major things on that bus that were so off that
they were on another planet. Seller said that anyone
can nit-pick a vehicle if they tried hard enough.
Pffft! I didnt even have to try. Ray Charles and
Stevie Wonder must have detailed it. It was way beyond
foul. Any of us would be hard pressed to pay more than
five grand for it. We'd want to immediately tear it
down and do it right. Two examples were the gaping
hole where the cargo doors were supposed to latch to
the floor. The other example was that the obvious
repop Westy rack was literally held together with
cotter pins!!! Yuck! Not enough bandwidth to catalog
them all.
I have the contact information if anyone wants a total
piece of ****.
Another red and white window bus that was previously
featured in one of the magazines as a Florida Cruiser
with the matching red trailer had signage in the back
deck that stated that it could cruise at 120 MPH. Dual
Kadrons on a 1600 with a stretched return spring and
the coil mounted to the left side horizontal engine
compartment was the &quot;power plant&quot;. Nice work &lt;sarcasm&gt;
on rewelding the divider back into the bus. Looked
like they used galvanized pipe or something. That bus
was nasty as well but not as bad as the other hack
job.

The only bus that I saw that was nice was a Coral
(Sealing wax) and White 1960 or '61 23 window that
looked as if someone who really cared did a really
nice &quot;real&quot; restoration on it. Possibly it was a
Transporter Restoration project a previous year. Not
trying to kiss butt to the Transrest crew but it was
in a league of its own.~ nice and proper.
I'm not totally convinced that the &quot;bottom has dropped
out&quot; of the deluxes but this particular batch of buses
was extremely amatuer except where noted. Don't go
jump off of a bridge-just do your bus right or don't
expect to sell for stupid dollars! Professionally
restored (in the real sense of the term) vehicles will
always be worth something. Properly restored or
maintained buses will do nothing but become more rare.
Do 'em up right and use them for the enjoyment sake. I
agree that stocks would be a wiser investment in
today's market if you are looking at only the short
term return. Stocks can drop like a rock but a nice
bus will still be nice tomorrow.
