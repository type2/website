Subject: Re: [VB] batteries and cold

&gt; where is the mistake in my logic? 
&gt; thanks for clearing this up for me.
-------------------- Clip ---------------------
Seems to be crazy logic in a lot of things.
Keeping your fresh flashlight and camera batteries in the refrigerator
extends their usable life before you put them into service.
By the same token cold reduces the ability for the battery to use its
electrolysis in passing current between the plates. Sort of like mixing
dye in very cold water vs in warm water, the warm water mixes more
thourougly just like making jello.
Batteries could easily be designed to operate in these colder
temperatures and if you start searching Marithom Batteries and other
Aircraft Battery manufacturers you'll see they offer specialized
batteries for cold and extreme cold weather applications.
When metal mechanical parts shrink in cold weather it also burdens the
battery more in the cranking process.
Not very techno.
