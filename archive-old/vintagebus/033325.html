 &gt;Try WW for that, plus the rear tube seal, and make sure to get the plastic 
 bushings.  We have heard that you can install these bushings by pulling the 
 long shift rod all the way forward.  If not then when you eventually remove 
&gt;  the tranny.  Either way grease the heck out of the bushings!   Eric&amp;Barb 



you can replace the front rear bushing (the one on the rear shift rod) w/o pulling the tranny, but not the rear most one.  those rear two look like little badminton birdies. You have to pull the rear shift rod backwards to replace the rear most bushing, so if your tranny is out that is the best time, to take apart the linkage between the front and rear shift rods, pull the rear rod out to the back and replace those two bushings. 
 To pull the rear rod out to the front you must cut the front of the bus off, which you probably don't want to do with your driver.   yes your shifting is much better with all bushings replaced
