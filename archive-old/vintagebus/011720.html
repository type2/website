&gt;&gt;I found a really cool ad from April '67 that showed a bug, 
&gt;&gt;squareback, and a deluxe bus.  The big text is:
&gt;&gt;Small.Medium.Large.  The view is from above and forward.

I have a book that I purchased back in the early 80s from Classic Motorbooks, 
a.k.a. Motorbooks International, which contains two VW ads of interest.  It's a
collection of American magazine ads for automobiles from 1904 until the 70s,
with a lot of discussion as well.  Very interesting if you enjoy more than just
VWs.

They have a 1969 VW ad that is just a photo of the lunar landing module.  The 
caption says, &quot;It's ugly, but it gets you there&quot;, followed by the VW logo.

There's also a 1963 ad that's a 3/4 view of a Samba with the sunroof open, 
taken from the front, a little bit above the roof line.  The main caption says:

        Do You Have the Right Kind of Wife For It?

The text reads:

        Can your wife bake her own bread?
        Can she get a kid's leg stitched and not
     phone you at the office until it's all over?
        Find something to talk about when the
     TV set goes on the blink?
        Does she worry about the Bomb?
        Make your neighbors' children wish
     that she were their mother?
        Will she say, &quot;Yes&quot; to a camping trip
     after 50 straight weeks of cooking?
        Let your daughter keep a pet snake in
     the back yard?
        Invite 13 people to dinner even though
     she only has service for 12?
        Name a cat &quot;Rover&quot;?
        Order escargots?
        Live another year without furniture and
     take a trip to Europe instead?
        Let you give up your job with a smile?
        And mean it?

        Congratulations.

&gt;&gt;The ad from '65 invites people to test drive a bug, door open
&gt;&gt;view from the rear.  I saw another issue with a text only ad.
&gt;&gt;The ones from '71 had no VW ads.

Ah, memories.  Test drive a bug?

I bought my first car in August, 1964.  My dad &amp; I went to the VW dealer in 
Ypsilanti, Michigan to look at beetles.  I really liked the Jade Green one that 
I test drove.  The salesman took us out onto a railroad track outside of town,
and drove down the ties at about 35 mph to demonstrate how tough it was and how
well it handled. 

The price for a new one was a little more than I could afford.  So the salesman
offered to sell me the demo for about two or three hundred dollars less.  But I
got to thinking, &quot;He takes that thing out on the tracks every day for every
customer&quot;, so I declined the offer.

Wound up getting a '61 Volvo 544 that had the head milled for club racing
instead.  My first VW would have to wait another five years.
