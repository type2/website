After receiving no response to my search for the owner of my 1964 Single
Cab from New Mexico I was hoping one of the list members from there
could help me. In South Carolina you can do a Title Search to find out
any and all previous owners that had the vehicle registered in S.C. The
next time one of you is in your friendly DMV could you PLEASE pick me up
a Title Search form and snail mail it to me! That is if N.M. offers this
service. I would be willing to pay for your effort and obviously the
cost of postage. Please pmail me if your going to your DMV soon, or
don't mind doing it on your next trip.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Meredith Murray
