Subject: packing oil pump for easier priming
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.A41.3.96.1000622131844.68084H-100000_at_pdx444.pdx.intel_dot_com&gt;


Well, I just finished getting my new motor put together, and per the
Wilson book packed the oil pump with grease to ease priming.  I've now
read a few things suggesting you should use oil, or petroleum jelly and
not grease as grease won't break down well and could cause problems. 

So... what is the consensus on this? Is using grease going to be a
problem? If so, I'll pull out my pump and clean it out before I start this
thing. If not, I'd like to know, as I'd prefer not to have to pull the
pump off...
