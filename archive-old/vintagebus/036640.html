So,

	As we close in on Bad Camberg, I find myself with a ticket to London
and that's about it.

	I still need to find a room near Camberg unless someone knows that
there are still rooms available in the city.

	PLUS, I'm currently going solo, and would prefer to 'hook-up' with
someone for the duration of the show.

	For those of us fortunate in attending, Can you help me out?  (The
lodging portion is most important, the hanging out is negotiable,)

	Right now,  I wish I had a German friend that I could make to do the
calling for room reservations....

	HELP!
