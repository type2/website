Well,  I don't have any hands on knowledge of getting the tank to fit, but many
years ago,  I had a '71 tank installed in my '67 splitty by Buttera Motors in
Bothell, WA..  That would be 14235 100th Ave NE     425 821-1222.     The tank
was a tight fit, but they got it in and I never had any trouble with it (17
years).  They had to modify the filler and used the 71 tank filler with a rubber
hose adapter to the tank.

I don't have the '67 any more :-(  but if you get stuck, maybe they might be a
source for ya.

&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt;
&gt;     I thought I'd let you all know about the work I'm doing on my bus.  It's
&gt; been marking it's spot on the driveway for quite some time now and lately
&gt; It's been showing signs of blatter control problems ;-)  I'd been waiting
&gt; for a good time to install that new larger gas tank and this would be just
&gt; the excuse I needed.
&gt;
&gt;  .......................................Anyone got any experience making it
&gt; fit better??
