&gt; I have never had any experience with torsion bars. Rumour has it you can
&gt;  &quot;crank them up&quot; to compensate for sagging. Has anyone done this? My 62

&gt; Since it is my first split and I don't see many others it is hard to decide
&gt; what is normal.

Get the book and read it. We have the no-name british service manual
in addition to the Muir. The british manual has a nice explanation
with specs on how to do this. The basic principle to remember is that
there are a different number of splines on each end of the torsion
bar. By moving them different number of splines clockwise and counter
clockwise (for instance, two on the inside and one on the outside),
you can set them quite accurately to within less than a degree
(measured on the spring plate, with the plate pulled out past the
lower bump stop).

We just did this with my truck, a '59 single cab) to very good
effect. You DO want to use a protractor, though, and I can certainly
recommend the electronic ones as being quite effective. Take your time
and measure a lot and you'll do fine.
