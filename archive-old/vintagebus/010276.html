We offer specially outfitted transaxles just for type 4 engine conversions.
These trannys have the best gearing for the torque band and rpm range of a
street driven converted vehicle.

Subject: [BSKA] More T4 2L gearing thoughts.


&gt;After reading what a lot of you had to say about the conversion of a bus to
&gt;IRS, I'm forced to go along with the idea that I've come to believe more
&gt;firmly in after this 1776/Freeway flyer conversion I've done to my bus.
&gt;That is, &quot;Keep it stock.&quot;  Not in a fanatical way mind you but to go with
&gt;what works and what is more easily fixable on the road as you travel.
&gt;
&gt;I think the best bet is to get another freeway flyer transmission built but
&gt;this time with reinforcements to handle the increased torque from the T4
2L.
&gt;This way I'll be keeping the reduction boxes and have all kinds of grunt
&gt;power, even at cruise with a full load, to keep moving.  I want to be able
&gt;to pull a trailer through the mountains and have a load of gear in the bed
&gt;of the truck and not have to worry about my engine working too hard.  A T4
&gt;2L in a splitty with low gearing - wow - how much easier of a life can an
&gt;engine have? :-)
&gt;
&gt;I also want my DC to be my rescue vehicle.  Meaning that if I find an old
VW
&gt;in a field and want to tow it home on a trailer, the DC will be the vehicle
&gt;of choice - not some V8 Chevy truck that makes the VW in tow bow it's head
&gt;in shame and in acknowledgement that yes, the Chevy is the &quot;real&quot; work
&gt;truck.
&gt;
&gt;I will still be able to cruise 70 to 75 if I want and have all kinds of
&gt;power loaded or unloaded.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for all the thoughts everyone.  It helped me make a good and
informed
&gt;decision.
