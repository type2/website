Why not unscrew the thing and take it to a parts washer; yours or a friends?
These resuvors *do* come off. The old metal style has a nut inside and the 
late plastic style has a nut underneath.
It's probably easier if you don't have a belly pan. But i would'nt know, mine 
never has had one and probably never will. Crawl under your bus and while you 
are removing it check your master cylinder fittings and seals /boot to see if 
everything is corrosion and leak proof
