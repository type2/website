Hi Mark,
Do you not mean the fuel pump or distributor base?

&lt;&lt;Hmmm, my first thought is that the seals on the base of the oil cooler are

Sounds like it to me.  If it was the push rod tubes the oil would not make 
it's way both uphill and upstream through the cooling air flow.  At least not 
in large amounts like you indicate.  Eric&amp;Barb
