Subject: Re: [VB] windshield leak

Clara, all,

When the DPO was &quot;fixing&quot; the windscreen ledges in my bus when he owned it, he used some fiberglass shmoo that leaks and looks like ass from the outside.

He was so damn proud of himself for that move, and the do-it-yourself window tint he put all the way around.

I loved telling him about peeling it all off.

All that, and the lowering and crappy car tires and my bus was on the fast train to hooptyville.
Luckily I stepped in in time.

I'm wondering if I'll be able to get the fiberglass off when I go in there.

Also, what about repair?  Is someone selling the metal bits, or will it have to be a shop fab?

Took my kids to La Brea this summer. Totally awesome.

Billy

&gt;Roofing tar is good for your bus,  and it smells &gt;like La Brea Tar Pits. Take your kids to see all the &gt;neat ancient bones there.  from dire wolves and 
&gt;woolley mammoths and critters like that.
