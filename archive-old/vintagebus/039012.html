Subject: 10mm nyloc nut in engine case?
Date: Sun, 13 Dec 1998 11:11:44 -0600

Changed the oil in Zorm's new engine yesterday and found....  a 10mm
nyloc nut and a washer (for a 10mm).  I've been racking my brain trying
to figure out what it's from and just can't resolve it.

The nut apparently used to have the little plastic ring around it
(nyloc, right?) because it has a grove where it should have been.
Neither the nut nor the washer is chewed up at all.  They were found
lying just forward of the strainer in the bottom of the case.

The Engine is from a 74 bug and has 150 miles on it since a complete
rebuild.  The only thing I can think this nut might be from is maybe
something to do with the oil pickup tube.  Anyone know if there is a nut
that secures the thing in a 74 bug case?

I'm relatively certain it wasn't laying around loose in there when I
assembled everything and I can't imagine how it could have gotten into
the engine from the outside since then.

Anybody got any ideas?  I'd really hate to have to disassemble the whole
bloody thing again, but if I have to I have to.

Thanks.
