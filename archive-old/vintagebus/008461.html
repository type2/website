Ronnie,

Seems to me it would be the same resistance drop for each sender. Since we'd
all have to interpolate the results to our own situation, it would not
amount to a hill of beans.

&gt; At this time I have 2 senders, 1 in the pressure relief and the other in
the
&gt; type 3 oil cooler I have on my bus, I also have the VDO dipstick sender
that
&gt; works with thier gauge&gt; This gives me 3 pick-up points to check oil temp.
&gt; Now if I would only get off my A#_at_ and install the gauge, we all know I
&gt; don't like them, but with all the engine veriations I build and use along
&gt; with the trans combo's I am going to start to keep track of all my
readings,
&gt; rpm's, oil temp and pressures. The only thing I was thinking of if I use a
3
&gt; position switch will it change the readings due to the resistance in the
&gt; switck?
