Bob Lessard wanted some info on seals for his
redux gear boxes.

Are these the soft plugs behind the spring plate
for access to the lower inner bearing or the paper
gaskets between the housing halves?

The soft plugs are available, I believe, from BusBoys
and are metal instead of plastic like some that I've
seen.  Use Loctite 518 on the surfaces and after you
install it apply a thin bead of silicone around the plug
between it and the springplate.  This usually works
for me.

The paper gaskets I do not think are available anymore.
I just clean the mating surfaces and apply #518 to it.
Again, works for me and does not leak.
