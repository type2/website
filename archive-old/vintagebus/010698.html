 But im curious, didnt VW change the part numbering system pst barndoor,
 i/e if it was a part for a barndoor as he claims the PN wouldnt be in the
 9 digit format?
  &gt;&gt;

they changed the part number system between june 53 and early 54.  the parts 
on my 53 bus have a different style of part number that tends to begin with 
29.  and is arranged differently.  I really have not cracked the code, and 
would love to find an early parts list. 

changed the rear shocks, and one spare had the 211.xxx.xxx new style number 
on it, while the old ones had the old style number on them.   The one I put 
on my bus do, however, leak out around the arms and there are two little 
puddles of jack oil under them in the garage.  :(
