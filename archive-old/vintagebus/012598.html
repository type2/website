Gerald,
My bet is that you should use *rubber* material to stop the leak.
Huh!? RUBBER!? Whad-da?! everyone asks themselves...

Have you checked the condition of the oil cooler seals or checked for a
infinitely small crack in the case in front of or behind the oilcooler
mounting spot? Call me whacky, call me weird, but I wonder if the oil is
seeping down the side of the case and only appears to be coming out of the
Number 3 cyl. The case that came out of my old '57 single cab ended up with
a crack in this area before it's final demise. Watch your oil level!!!! Kyle
and thousands of other folks will tell you that I am not accused of being a
poolplayer or an engine builder. I could be dead wrong but I'd put $5.00 on
it...

Hi all-
I have a pretty significant oil leak comming from between the number 3
cylinder and the case.  What type of liquid gasket material should I use
to solve the problem?
