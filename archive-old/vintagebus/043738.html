&gt;We just picked up a pack of ten VOA packaged Bosch made spark plugs at a VW 
&gt;Porsche meet near McMinnville Oregon last weekend.  [...]  Does anyone out
&gt;there have the info to what the part # ZVP 121 225 is supposed to fit?

I couldn't find a match for 121 225, but I found an Audi parts site with
ZVP 121 135C (100LS/Fox) and ZVP 121 087S (4000) spark plugs listed.  So
you may want to ask your friendly local Audi-heads about it.  You might
also ask Jim _at_ oldvolkshome_dot_com, he has lots of info about distributors
and maybe he still has a Bosch plug catalog floating around.  Do the
plugs happen to have the Bosch &quot;W...&quot; number on them?  If so they would
be easier to cross-reference.

Good luck!
