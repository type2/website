&gt; the chemical is much more likely to get into nooks and crannies and remove
&gt; rust where blasting or a wire wheel cannot reach.

&gt; the real answer:
&gt; i am lazy and if i can get rid of the rust by spraying on/off a liquid as
&gt; opposed to grinding all day and taking even more skin off my
&gt; knuckles/sandblasting and having sand in my boxers for a week and making a
&gt; mess of my shop... i'll do it.  The rust is so minimal and surface, that i
&gt; think a chemical treatment will do the trick.  Most of the original paint
&gt; is still there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I've learned a technique to blast wheels that takes less than 5 minutes 
&gt;&gt;&gt;per, and I do it out on the lawn, so the sand just ends up sinking thru
&gt;&gt;&gt;the grass and improving drainage!

&gt;&gt;&gt;I used to be a chemical guy, but now I blast.  I think the blasting
&gt;&gt;&gt;leaves me with a much better surface to work with, and the paint sticks
&gt;&gt;&gt;to it like you wouldn't believe!



&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

And now for the best of both worlds...

First sandblast.  Then wipe a layer of the ospho onto the newly blasted
surface.  Then after a few seconds wipe it back off.  This gives the acid just
enough time to make that inert layer ospho is famous for.

If you don't use both, you're not getting it all.

By the way, for areas that recieve a lot of water such as wheel wells, check

The por15 is good, but 95%zinc galvanemetric paint is better because you are
actually setting up an electrolysis reaction.  The web site will explain
everything.  No, they don't know me, I'm just passing along info. 
Here, it would probably be better not to use the ospho so that the
electrically conductive paint will be able to electrically connect with the
metal to be protected.  Don't want an inert layer in there.  Otherwise, use
ospho.

And use por15 on everything you don't galvanize.
