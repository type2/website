Mid 61 they changed the cargo doors fron high hinge to low hinge.
They also changed the front doors at that time.
Inside door &quot;regulators&quot; changed at this time as well.

*snip*

an does any one have a window regulator that notched rail in the front door 
&gt;window channel and are they the same for every year?

&quot;They're all the same.&quot;

thanks thom

So maybe a little &quot;clara&quot;fication is needed

are we all talking about the same thing?

by regulator i didn't mean latch mechanism. I know they go through the glass 
in later years.  I was meaning the thing that they latch into; that notched 
rail.
