I had great luck using INTERCITY Lines a few years back.  I shipped a 911
&gt;from California to Connecticuit.  They have an ad in PANORAMA and can be
reached at 800 221 3936 or www.intercitylines_dot_com.

&gt;
&gt;I have a friend who needs to ship a car from Sacramento to Rochester.
&gt;Any recommendations on companies and general tips and tricks
&gt;would be appreciated.   It's a 1966 convertible bug, in extremely
&gt;nice shape, so it matters how it's treated.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
&gt;
