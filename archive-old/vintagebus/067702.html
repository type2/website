Subject: RE: [VB] z-bed kit

&gt; anyone install a z-bed kit before??
&gt; do you like it?


Just a note, for those looking for a cheaper alternative, that I sell a
European made &quot;do it yourself&quot; rear sofabed kit designed specifically for
the Bus, for $95 with listmember discount (part # 98553).  This is a
hardware/hinge assembly similar to what came in a Westy; you lift the
sofabed up and out and it pulls out even with the rear cargo area.  As with
the Z-bed, the seat/bed itself is not included, just the hardware.  But
unlike the Z-bed (which costs several times the price but uses your stock
bus rear seat), this one is meant to be used with a wood sofabed (as on a
Westy).  You make it out of wood, foam, and the fabric of your choice, then
bolt on the hardware according to the instructions. If you're handy, and can
get the raw materials inexpensively, it's a cheap way to put a Westy style
sofabed in your bus.  (Of course another cheap way is to find a good used
Westy sofabed, if you can.)
