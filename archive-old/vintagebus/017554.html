There's a bus on ebay.
I believe it's a 67 split deluxe walk-thru with a late
model pop! (seller says &quot;factory installed original&quot; -
yeah right)

No rear bumper, engine or interior, and it has a black
steering wheel &amp; column (?)
Looks like the front end and bumper are pretty
straight, and it has a full set of beltline trim,
though.

Currently $1000, reserve not met.
in Michigan.
any daring types out there?
