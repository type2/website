&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;What is best thing to use to remove orloosen up 35 years of build up of 
 dirt and grease that has abundantly caked on? There layers after layers on 
 the front end parts surrounding the wheels and also back wheels too.  &gt;&gt;
  &gt;&gt;

a stick.   with a point .  preferably wood or plastic so it does not scratch 
the paint .  lay some old newspaper underneath.  the paint underneath should 
be in great shape from the protective casing. grease is good.
