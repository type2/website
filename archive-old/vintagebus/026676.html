Subject: Re Battery Dead

Hi All,
Most standard automotive batteries hate being drained flat. It has
something to do with specific gravity in the lead/acid battery fluid and
the plate's willingness to react. That's why they make deep discharge
batteries for thing like trolling motors. These batteries are more
tolerant of long charge discharge cycles but even these won't react well
to 3 months with a discharge load applied. I also have had some luck
recharging batteries in this condition but not much and most of it was
bad. And yes the radio will work without the key.

&lt;&lt; Hi All,
 After letting the 62 sit for a couple weeks,
 I thought I'd better fire it up and take her around the
 block a few times. It's got a fairly new battery (3 mos), but
 it was deader than a doornail. I figured out that I had
 left the radio on the last time I drove it, so It's been 
 suckin juice for about 2 weeks. Now it doesn't want to
 take a charge (6v _at_ 6amp). Is this battery toast??
 Can it be serviced?? Or should I take it back and play 
 dumb? BTW does everyone else's radio stay on when 
 the key is off? Never had a VW with a radio that worked
 so I'm not sure if it is wired right.
