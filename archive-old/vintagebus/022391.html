Subject: Shipping advice for parts &amp; hail damage
Mime-Version: 1.0

I've got a vw body part in a box that's 38 x 16 x 44 inches and weighs only
about 40 lbs.

UPS online says it exceeds maximum size or something. Any suggestions on
who will ship this for a reasonable price? I'm getting $150 for it and it's
going from 76901 zip to 11434 zip. Thanks for any advice.

Bus content: A buddy of mine scored a VERY straight and complete '65
hardtop deluxe. Lots of accessories. Original engine. Runs. No rust, but
needs new paint. Only real problem is some hail damage on the roof. What's
the best way to deal with that? Oh yeh, original VW dealer license plate
frames. Very cool. Especially since there isn't, and hasn't, been a VW
dealer here for quite a while.
