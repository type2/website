We drove 7 hours up and down the desolate wasteland of Central California
yesterday only to come up tired and empty handed.

It would not be so today.

Acting on a lead I got last week, once again fellow listee Tom Mink and I
set out early in the morning on a rescue mission, only this time we hit pay
dirt - literally.

We scored 2 1960 double door panels, which were currently owned by the
*original* owner's grandson; gramps bought them both at the same time on
the same day at the same dealer in SF.  Both dove blue.  License plates are
sequential.  

Buses with provenance.

I also got a 1960 walk-thru panel which I &quot;had&quot; to take as part of the deal.

They worked at a hotel for 22 years - not even registered - until the
current owner got them and turned them into roming domiciles - one for
winter, one for summer.  One of the buses was rear-ended on the freeway by
someone whose cruise control got stuck, and then both were parked.  Luckily
under a pole barn.  They are covered top to bottom with about 1/16&quot; of dust
and lichens.

On the overhead vent panels are the numerals &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; respectively.  

Bus #1 has 52,000 original miles; bus #2 has 73,000 miles.  They are
complete down to the cab divider, block off plate, tool pouch, etc.  No
serious hacks.  All the camper stuff was done without hacking the actual bus.

Bus #1 (4/60, now owned by Tom Mink) has some good quarter panel dents, and
a nice nose.  Bus #2 (11/59) has some nose issues, and bashed cargo doors
on the passenger side.  Some rocker rust on #2, but the front floors on
both buses are decent.

Both buses have rotted out noses all the way across the lower nose.  No
idea why.  Both buses have beautiful belly pans, and Tom's even has a pedal
pan.  Both even had gray painted hubcaps.

Both buses came with logs, detailing every fill up, what station, what
town, how much gas and computed gas mileage, from 1982 when they were put
on California roads for the first time.  Every oil change, the new engine;
mine got a new tranny 8000 miles ago.

Both have home-done rattle-can and brush paint jobs.

Cargo areas of both buses are the most pristine I've seen on a non-restored
bus.

We spent *all* day bringing these things home, from 7:00am to 7:00pm.  A
very, very long day,

Both buses reak of mouse detritus.

The walk-thru panel is the biggest hooptie you ever saw.  Hit super-hard in
the front-left 1/4, they section in a whole front 1/4 of another bus - a
weld seam right down the dash.  Cut wheel wells, windows cut into the
sides.  A few good parts, and that's about it.  I should section the
walk-thru into my new panel :)  Gonna part it and junk it, not much else
that can be done with it.  Big nut tranny in it even.

A bunch of misc NOS and new parts in the buses, like an NOS early ebrake
cable, NOS wiper arms &amp; blades, and lots of tune-up parts.
