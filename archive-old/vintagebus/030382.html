&gt; Hi everybody.
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to get some of DARTHVW's small parts
&gt; re-chromed (door handle, clock trim, OG nose emblem) I
&gt; was wondering if any of you know a source in or near
&gt; Los Angeles (or if there's a really good one elsewhere
&gt; I can ship the stuff I guess).
&gt;

I went to the &quot;Hot Rod Swap Meet&quot; today in Long Beach and came home with the
card of
J.T. Classic Chrome
15320 Proctor Ave
City Of Industry CA 91745
626-369-5994

Can't speak to their business, but their work looked good on the classic bumpers
that they had ready to go.
Asked him about chroming the fresh air vent cover from my Jag and without seeing
it he ball parked $65 to prep and chrome.
