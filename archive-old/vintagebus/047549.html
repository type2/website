&lt;&lt; H Y P O C R I T E.....isnt this the exact same thing as lowering a bus?  If
 you arent happy with your bus at standard height and you lower it, that hurts
 the bus's feelings.  Dont you feel guilty for not liking your bus as VW
 intended it to be?  If someone transplants a roof, there's a very good chance
 a bus came from the factory that way.  We've all seen a factory sunroof
 Kombi's, but there's never been a lowered bus from the factory.   
  &gt;&gt;

im a little confused on the HYPOCRITE comment.whos really being the hypocrite,
the ones who think lowering is good and cutting is bad, or the ones who think
cutting is fine and lowering is bad?or is this just a case of defending people
you like and mocking people you dont like?as for &quot;transplanting&quot; a roof
becuase another bus was built that way doesnt make it a factory option. the
sunroof std/kombis use a sunroof clip, skylites and all, that means you need
to get a real sunroof clip and weld up all the skylites. then put the belly
pans in. all cutting and welding, where as lowering is merely BOLT ON!! easily
REVERSABLE. just pointing out the facts.
