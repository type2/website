Subject: bumpers and seals

Thanks to Ronnie ( I think it was) for his tip on the bumper seals.  I
called around and finally ended up calling a place in Ohio called
Stoudart. (Typing this off the cuff so at least the general info is
correct).  This place mainly deals in porsche parts.  I asked for the
seals off a 356 porsche bumper and BAM!  They had plenty of it in
stock.  I also picked up seals that would fit around the front bow base
and the rear bows base.  The seals fit between the bumper and the bumper
guard. Cut to size.  The seals for the bows was a little to small but
you can stretch them to fit.  It REALLY dressed the bumper up.  I
figured that it would be a shame to bolt the parts together on the
bumper with out some type of seals.  Thanks and you get my vote Ronnie
to stock these parts.
