Subject: Engine..so far, so good....real good!

After having to pull my first DIY rebuilt engine to replace the badly 
head, I was nervous about how it was gonna run. The newly rebuilt 
head looked great. I put it all together, installed it, and it 
started up and ran fine.

I took it for a good 25 mile test drive today. Man...it ran sooooo 
good! When I got back, I went to the back to check heat and see how 
things looked. The engine was plenty cool and the best part was that 
it was running like a &quot;singer&quot;. It really did look and sound like an 
old sewing machine. So smooth and easy. No rocking back and forth or 
anything. Just nice balanced smooth quiet running engine. I didn't 
think it could improve over before, but I guess that head was making 
more of a difference than I had originally thought.

I'm real proud of this rebuild. Though I've been plaqued with little 
problems, they ALL seem to be because of someone else....faulty parts 
or whatever. So I feel good that I did the right stuff myself...and 
it was MY first time!! Makes you think, doesn't it.

See ya!
