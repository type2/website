When I picked up my 59 single cab the PO gave me what was left of the
original bastard 40 engine tin and the shroud with the generator, the
generator has a double pulley!! could this be the drive for the double genny
stand? Also the cylinder tin has humps on it with the cylinder markings on
them 1 2  3 4 are stamped on raised humps, I have never seen this before,
enlighten me.

&lt;&lt; What is the second generator?  Is it a special one?  How about the
pulley?

Hi Kabayo,
We have one of these.  Still looking for the lower pulley for the second 
generator or measurement of or even the size of the pulley belt so we can 
figure out the size of the lower pulley.   Eric&amp;Barb
