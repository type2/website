Subject: P &amp; C's greetings from their epic road trip

Hi list,

P &amp; C safely made it to Flagstaff and will attend Jerome from here. Their 
next stop after Jerome will be Albequerque for Buses and Balloons. Between now 
and then, they will remain busy spotting vintage vehicles for sale on the side 
of the roads. 

Ricky
