&gt; I forget where the idle adjustment is on the type 1 1600DP (74 bug)  Is this 
&gt; the problem?  any ideas?

You need to tell us which carb you are using.

  Also, the &quot;hot start&quot; issue that plagues these older busses, does the &gt; 
&gt; engine turn over but not catch? or is there no juice to turn the starter?

Hot start usually means the engine will only turn over and start reliably 
when cold, when warm/hot it barely turns over and maybe/possibly/perhaps 
start, or not turn over at all.  Almost always this is due to corroded/loose 
electrical connections in the wiring system.
