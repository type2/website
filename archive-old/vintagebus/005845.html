Here's what happens when I get into something:  I was just going to get it
&quot;decent&quot; but now I can't stop.  I must be sick. I do still have plans for a
trip in this bus in the latter part of September!

It wasn't me that cut the spare tire well.....I have plans, though, to turn
the remnants of that and the gas heater slot into spare parts holders...

I have to thank the person what welded in the replacement battery pan!  Good
job!

A piece of info:  The only substance that I have scraped off of this bus
anywhere that has NOT had rust under it is roofing tar!  The metal
underneath was still shiny!  Almost all of the paint and definitely all of
the VW seam sealant has had rust to some degree. Let's hear it for roofing
tar!  (Although it is a real bear to remove!)

I intend to POR-15 the entire engine compartment.   You know that you have
attained success as a business when tour product's name becomes a verb.....

I would love to put in a bigger tank now, but we'll see....

Later on...

Gene
