&gt; &gt; It contains the

&gt; Whoa Scott, dont torch him yet, he may not know that
&gt; its attached itself to his computer, it doesnt  let
&gt; itself be known to the user.... lets be easy till we
&gt; know for sure it was intentional....
&gt; my 0.02 worth...

unfortunately I realized that AFTER I sent it off and then realized the
significance of the word TORCH.  I tried to hit cancel while it was
sending but it was too late.
