&gt; It can be used on either a standard or doghouse shroud.  The dished plate

&gt;
&gt; So where can one get this piece? is it avaliable new, or just used?

I suspect that it is only available used.  The current alternators use the
30A tin and no current vehicles are built with the 38A generators.
