Subject: Lost all Brakes Tonight!

How many people can say that they survived TWO runaway vehicles in the matter of a
few hours?

I was over at the shop where my Jag is and did some work on it this afternoon.
One of the guys was working on his son's Honda and was having a little trouble
with it.  The kid had just dropped an Integra engine in they were trying to tune
it up.  I was taking a break and standing next to the car when John reached in to
start the car and it was in gear, no clutch safety switch!

He was shocked and stood there and watched as it started to drive itself into the
shop.  Me like an idiot, thought I could dive through the open window and grab the
keys or gear shifter.  Just as I about to reach the keys,  my shoulder slammed
into the side of the building and jerked me right out of the car.  All I could do
was watch the car drive under a pick-up.  Don't think I broke anything, but the
shoulder sure hurts like hell now.

I dusted myself off after a while, put my tools away and figured it would be
useless to continue any further work.  I got into the double cab and went home.

2 stop signs away from home, I was slowing down when my foot just dropped to the
floor.  I pumped and nothing happened.  There is a van stopped in front of me!!!!
Quick dive to the right and a grab of the ebrake (its actually adjusted to work)
and stopped about 3&quot; behind but to the right of the minivan.

I slowly nursed it home and my driveway is on a slight incline, so I used the hill
and ebrake to stop in front of the garage.

I went into the house not bothering to check what happened to the brakes, I still
could not believe that what just happened actually did.  It was like some
surrealistic dream or something.

So, after watching the Dodgers beat the Phillies, I got my flashlight and went out
to the double cab to check what gave loose.  I first checked the wheels for signs
of brake fluid - none
I then turned the light on the master cylinder and it was covered in brake fluid.
It looks like the seals just gave loose without warning.

Ready for the final kicker?

Earlier in the day, on my trip over to the shop, I had loaded up all the remaining
parts into the truck to perform the drum to disc brake swap on the double cab
including a BRAND NEW DUAL CIRCUIT MASTER CYLINDER.

Somehow, I have to figure out how to swap a beam, route brake lines and do this
job with one good and one gimpy arm.
