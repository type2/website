&gt; ps. Being E and B, and Clara are at the Vintage meets this weekend, I 
&gt; thought I'd post this to save them the trouble when they get home!

Hi Ronnie,
Aaahh, we knew we could count on you!!!!  Vintage weekend was great!!  Did 
not find anything OMG for our VW collection.  Got too meet lots of new faces to 
old Email names and plenty of old VW friends/fiends we have dealt with face to 
face for the last 15+ years!
