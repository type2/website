Subject: Re: [VB] Trailering Bus

Michael-

I tow my busses on a 6000 pound capacity dual axle trailer.  No 
problem, the trailer is more than up to the task.  I think most dual 
axle trailers will probably be able to handle the load - most axles 
are 3500# capacity.  I have seen U-Haul rental trailers that look 
like they would be easily capable of the task.  The trailer will need 
to have it's own brakes, ideally electrically operated from the tow 
vehicle.  The other important thing (I think) is to have really good 
tiedowns.  I tow with a 2000 Ch**y half ton truck, and it does fine.

&gt;Hi All-
&gt;
&gt;I am going to be renting a trailer to move a 65 bus a good 800 mile 
&gt;and need to get a few spec's on what sort of trailer would be 
&gt;required. So my questions
&gt;
&gt;1. How much does a 65 Bus weigh (this is just a regular van- doesn't 
&gt;have all the camper equipment in it)
&gt;2. How &quot;wide&quot; is the bus (i.e what sort of width would thr trailer have to be)
&gt;3. Finally would a double axle trailer be sufficient or would a tri 
&gt;axle be preferable?
&gt;
&gt;Any other tips for a realtively inexperienced trailer tower would be 
&gt;apprecaited.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;

&gt;Honest to God, I'm telling you the truth, you can do it yourself. For the
&gt;big money you will spend with a pro, you can do a pretty darn nice job in
&gt;your garage. The products these days go on easy and dry in about an hour. If
&gt;I was going to pay for anything, I'd pay for the body work. That's where all
&gt;the time goes.
