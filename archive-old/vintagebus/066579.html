Subject: RE: [VB] Tent question

&gt; I have a '67 deluxe and would like to road trip in it, I was curious if
&gt; anyone on the list has any suggestions for tents that would make a trip
&gt; more enjoyable, I'm not looking for originality just functionality.


We have an inexpensive brand new side tent, complete with sleeping cabin,
for $199.  You can see a picture at http://busdepot_dot_com/tent.JPG .  This is
by far the lowest priced VW specific tent on the market, and is available
exclusively from the Bus Depot.

The tent attaches to the rain gutter (no hardware to install). Like most
modern European tents it does not have a floor, but an included separate
sleeping cabin with floor (a tent within a tent, so to speak) simply clips
inside it, turning half of the tent into its own room with flloor.  The
whole thing packs extremely small for storage and assembles quickly.

For the typical bus owner, who will probably use it maybe 5-10 times a year
at most, this is probably all you need, and at the low price it's easy to
justify buying it.  For those who want something &quot;higher-end,&quot; though, we do
sell a more expensive tent
http://busdepot_dot_com/partsimages/awning2.JPG  -$299; or $399 with sleeping
cabin) as well.  It is made of a heavier, canvas like material, whereas the
cheaper one is nylon like many standalone tents are. While this does give it
a more &quot;substantial feel,&quot; it also makes it much bulkier than the cheaper
one when stored.

Also, I should note that we also have a basic awning, which also attaches to
the rain gutter without the need for permanent modifications or hardware.
It's just $79 and details are at http://199.217.241.240/awning.JPG .
