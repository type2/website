Have a carburetor question

I have just removed dual weber 34's and installing a single carb. A solex
34. I need to know how/where to hook up a couple of things. I have no
current wires for the carb, so I need to set it up. Where does the wire to
the choke come from? Where does the wire to the air bypass come from. Please
help me so I can get this set up correctly.

Thanks

Eric
