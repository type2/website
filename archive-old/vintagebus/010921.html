&lt;&lt; I plan on getting them powder coated, when I can afford it. The brightest

Hi Volks, 
There is also powdercoating high content zinc primer.  Which over a 
galvanized coating would be extra protection.  Some powdercoaters slightly 
sandblast galvanized coatings to give the powdercoating a grip on the zinc 
coating.  Which tends to thin the galvanized coating.  Eric&amp;Barb
