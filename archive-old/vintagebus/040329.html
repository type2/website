Subject:  RE: [VB] More on Propane and VWs

We have run all my water-cooled cars (ya gotta
have a tow vehicle!) that we have owned for the last
seven years on propane only or dual fuel (propane or gas).
Our current 98 F**d sedan is dual fuel.  LP conversion
is so common in Oz that you buy LP through a pump at 
the gas station, just like gas.

I had a bay window type 4 that I put on gas about 8 years ago.  There's
a few minor problems like heating the converter/mixer
to stop it frezing etc etc (down with coolant in a 
water cooled vehicle) but it can be done..

The major problem for VWs on LPG is valve seat recession and wear. Propane
makes valves and seats run damn hot. The type 4 did a set of seats
in about 20,000 kms.

Some say that cars that can run on unleaded (stellited seats) are fine
for LP.  They're better but seats still do wear out a lot faster.  I drive
a reasonable commute and I put three heads in 200,000 miles on our
last water pumper.  All heads were LPG prepared, all burnt seats and had
huge
amounts of valve seat recession when pulled..... 

I did my propaning on vw's before the new 'unleaded suitable' heads
were available.  They may be better, but I think  they're
cut to reduce compression rather
than reflecting any huge increase in valve or seat technology.

I emailed Bob H when he was experimenting and suggested that
valve seat recession and wear would be a major problem and that this could
be eased (but not solved) by injecting an upper cylinder lubricant
through a venturi in a gas only carb......

I still drive on LP in my water pumper commuter.  
It is cheaper in the long run in Oz, even
with the valve seat problem and its a much cleaner fuel than
gas. Not sure I'd ever try and put a VW on LP again.  At least
be prepared for the maintenance...

--So I know Bob Hoover did a study on propane and decided it wasn't feasible
but I must admit with rising gas prices and my workmate friend John's nice
clean oil dipstick after 3 years and 90,000 miles on his Ford V8, I've
thought about it.  With my T4 project that I want to start after my ebay
marathon is overwith,  I just might put this little doodad to use.  It's
easy to add-on and try - easy to remove when you get pissed off because it
doesn't work.  I'm aware of the power loss incurred by burning propane but
after building this 1776 engine, I have a totally newfound respect for a
stock and reliable design.  I've also thought a good place to mount a
propane tank is in the back luggage area in my bus or even on the roofrack.
Putting fins on it to make it look like a missle or simply make it look like
some kind of rocket launcher would be awesome.  And since my friend gets
propane on contract, I would get it cheaper through him for my local travels
vs. metering it out a few pounds at a time.

Just food for thought.
