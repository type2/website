Subject: Re: [VB] Tires, Camping/Road Trip preparedness

well I didn't do the drive in my bus (unfortunatly) becouse my bus is in top
shape unlike my company van .. but driving 75 about 9-10 hours it took 17
this time becouse of my tire troubles..im going to do it again in a week but
from kc-nashville this time il have a accurate time. OH!! and try not to
take the trip on sunday! im live in california and I didn't know that
EVERYONE IN THE SOUTH GOES TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY!!!  and if they don't go to
church they CLOSE EARLY!! I took 24-&gt;57-&gt;70 If I remember correctly? AAA
roadside helps a lot and a cell if you can GET A SIGNAL!!!


SORRY FOR YELLING IM STILL A LITTLE STRESSED FROM THAT TRIP :)
