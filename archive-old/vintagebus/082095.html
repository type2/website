&gt; OK guys be nice I am new again to this vw thing. I
&gt; have bought a bay 68
&gt; truck, it has been sitting at least 15 years. Now
&gt; for the question it&lt;&lt;

You really don't want a bay window truck, they are
useless and completely un-desirable...So just tell me
where you are located and I will swing by right away
(tonight even) and take that thing home and get it out
of your way, I won't even charge you for a towing fee ;^)...
