&gt; So I'm getting the impression that I goofed. 215/75/15 is too large by all
&gt; the replies I'm getting.  But I also see why I ran into this problem.   A)
&gt; there is a legend of too many tire threads on the list, so I didn't ask :)
&gt; B) Archive searches revealed conflicting info as to 165 or 195 being the
&gt; &quot;stock size&quot; for 4.60 x 15&quot; .  I followed the 195 size -- but now believe
&gt; that the metric conversion actually comes out closer to 165 (slightly less
&gt; in fact).  Can someone confirm this?

First of all, the stock bus size is 6.5 inches. 4.6 is the beetle
size.

Here's how I calculate the size:

There's 25.4 mm per inch, so 4.60 inches equals 162 mm. For me that's
close enought to 165 to be real. Now the issue of diamater must be
considered. Tires without the aspect ratio (the 75 in 215/75-15) are
considered to be 80's. Therefore, the height of the sidewall on the
165 will be 80% of 165, or 132mm, or 5.2 inches. Adding this twice to
the diameter of the wheel, 15&quot;, gives us 25.4&quot;. I&quot;m not sure what the
diameter is supposed to be, but I think that's close.

These are admittedly rough calcs for a number of reasons. I'm ignoring
the actual rolling diameter. I'm also ignoring the fact that very
rarely are the 6.4 or 165's from different manufacturers the same
size.

Hope that helps.
