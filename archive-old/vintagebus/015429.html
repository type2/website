I have one of the COSTCO ones.  It's holding up nicely so far.
I didnd't have it anchored, because it's on cement.  We had 50mph
winds one night which lifted it 5 feet off the ground, and that's with it
nestled between the house and 2 6' high fences.  If you were putting it out
in the openm, make sure to clamp it down well.

&gt; A while back there was a discussion about a portable shelter sold by COSTCO. 
&gt;   I am currently looking at purchasing one and wanted to know what others 
&gt; thought of them.   How well do they hold up?  I live north of Detroit and 
&gt; want to know if it would last for year around storage or will this not work? 
&gt;   How well does it anchor to the ground?  How sturdy is it?
