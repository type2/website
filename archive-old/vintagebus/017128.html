The description actually reminded me quite a bit of the evaporative
coolers that were readily available in the fifties.  RMMW's stocking
new ones these days, as well, for something like $450.  I've seen them
on non-VWs also.  Since they're intended for fitting into roll-up
windows, you do have to do some creative adaptation.
