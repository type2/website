Hello Again

&quot;Listee&quot; Jack Maynard

Does the light come on when you are starting the bus, and when you shut
it down? If not, then there is a problem with the light/sender circuit
rather than the oil pressure itself. I've see the wire hang loose and
only sometimes ground against something in the engine compartment,
lighting the light in the gauge momentarily....hopeful it is something
like this, maybe the wire grounding out at a bad spot...because this is
an easier fix...

&quot;My response&quot;
	(Oil Light comes on) No the light comes on usually after I have driven it
down the highway for
awhile. But when I turn it cold in the morning it is not on. The green light
is the oil pressure because at night sometimes my red light glows very
lightly when all the lights are on. I think I will change the oil sensor the
engine only has 9000 miles on it. Thanks for all your help I will buy a
sensor today and see if the fixes it.
