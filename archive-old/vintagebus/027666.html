To the list:

To anyone who thinks I was at all referring to GEORGE LYLE of Canyon Country CA
in my previous posts about my personal experience with a seller of a vehicle,
please note that not now, nor have I ever, referred to GEORGE LYLE of Canyon
Country CA in the context of that story or anything else for that matter.  I
further wish to inform any other GEORGE LYLES of Canyon Country Ca that may
exist, they are not involved either.  In fact, there never was, nor will there
ever, be a GEORGE of any kind mentioned in relation to that story.

For those of you who still think I was accusing someone of something (which
never happened) and need further clarification as to who the story that was
related to me was about you may p-mail me and I'll reveal the BIG mystery.

psssst.....there really is no mystery.

Once again I forget....  subtlety has NO place on the internet!

Have a nice day :-)

Steve
