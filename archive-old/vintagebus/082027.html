Subject: High Country Bus Festival - Envelope Art Contest

(Forwarded for Buddah, please respond to buddahvw (at)
hotmail dot com )

...announcing THE ENVELOPE ART CONTEST for this year's High
Country Bus Festival. 

Each year I try to make the art work for the HCBF shirt
something special. A few years ago I had a bunch of kids
sumit drawings and Teddy Jablonski's picture made it onto
that years shirt. 

BUT WHY LIMIT it only to the kids????????? 

so this year we are having an ENVELOPE ART CONTEST. The
winning design will have their art work printed on this
years HCBF shirt and the winning envelope will also entitle
its artist to one free shirt. 

It is pretty simple, when you mail your T-shirt order to
me, emote your artistic expression on that envelope! 

here are the rules: 
1) ONLY TWO COLORS ALLOWED, we can only afford to print 2
color shirts 
2) nothing that would be offensive, these shirts will be
worn and seen by all 
3) draw on front and back of envelope, both will be printed
from the winning envelope. 
4) no purchase necessary! If you don't want to order a
shirt you can send me an empty envelope 
5) All envelopes are due by JUNE 22,2005 
6) be creative and have fun with it 

here is a link to the T-shirt order form:

mail envelopes to: 
Michael Myers 
HCBF shirts 
2147 Highway 56 
Spartanburg, SC 29202 

that is for now, more details on activities for HCBF to be
posted soon! I am in need of volunteers, so if you would
like to help out, please let me know! Thanks!
