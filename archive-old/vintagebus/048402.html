 A friend of mine is looking at a splitscreen bus that contains the following
 information. I haven't seen the bus, he doesn't know much about them, but
 we've got this - 
 
 23 Type2 /255A prutz 545
 Fargrest NR 235 410 521
 
 I've guessed it's a '65 - anyone?...Bueller?
  &gt;&gt;

this is from the metal tag on the side of the overhead vent?  He should check 
the 2inch by 3inch M code tag behind the passenger seat.

it can be decoded at vintagebus_dot_com
