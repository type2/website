	I'm considering holding an event on a Mississippi River levy (this
levy will not be dry) in the sleepy little town of LeClaire, Iowa (corner of
Mississippi River and I-80). Can probably get a great deal on motel rooms
and it's a terrific location.

	Are there enough Midwest listees to make this a success?

	If it sounds do-able to you please respond.

	If you have any advice about staging such an event, let me know.

	Bill
