I called Radio Shack in San Diego and they no longer carry  #22-129B. 
Too bad as I just bought  the radio mentioned on the list a few weeks
ago.  My bus is still 6 volt and I am having a hard time finding this
(inverter/converter). Does anybody know where I can get one in town? Also
the 12 volt radio works fine but the tape player runs slow.  Is this what
the inverter is for?  Will it hurt to run the radio on 6 volt untill I
get the inverter?                                        											jon
