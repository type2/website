Thank you to all on this list!!!  And now for the results....drum roll 
please....
 
 Connection from alternator to battery was the bandit.  I had checked that 
connection at least a dozen times but I decided to just rewire it to see if 
anything would happen.  Lights totally out now, not even a lttle glow!!
 
Thanks to everyone!  This list just kicks A_at__at_!
