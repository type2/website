Subject: Re: Zorm's still not running right - no power.

I'm running a 009 and my exhaust is really hot as indicated below.  No
matter how I tune
the carb, I can't get a bit of soot to appear in the tailpipes.  My oil
temp is pretty high as well.

It was also suggested to me by the engine builder to put 135s in the
main (I think I have 132.5 or
something like that - 34pic3).  I haven't done that yet but I'm sure I'm
running lean.

I've got two matching scars on my legs in the shape of &quot;O&quot; from brushing
up against the tail pipe
unloading beach chairs.  Actually one is and &quot;O&quot; and the other is a &quot;C&quot;
as I didn't hit the tailpipe squarely.

&gt;Mike,
&gt;It sounds for all the world like it is totally leaned out. What main
jets
&gt;are in the carbs? What venturi's? Emulsion tubes? When you start it
from
&gt;cold, does the exhaust get flamethrower hot almost instantly? Fatten up
the
&gt;mains and see if it helps.
