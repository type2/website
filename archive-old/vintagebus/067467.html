&gt;I'm guessing that out oil reserves are somewhere in the same condition
&gt;with only about 10% remaining after only 100 years.

It's probably hard to know how much oil there was at the beginning of
widespread oil use (late 1800s maybe?).  You can make estimates, but
you also have to account for the fact that the technology has gotten
better.  If the oil companies of 1893 had the technology of 2003, it
would look like the oil reserves were much larger, because they'd be
able to economically extract more of it.

There is some historical US info at
http://www.eia.doe_dot_gov/neic/historic/hpetroleum3.htm , &quot;Annual
Reserves by State&quot;.  On page 17 of the PDF, it shows the U.S. total
crude oil reserves at 31,780 million barrels in 1977 and 22,446
million barrels in 2001.  http://www.eia.doe_dot_gov/emeu/iea/table81.html
has estimates for the whole world at 1.00 to 1.03 trillion barrels.

There's some current info at
http://www.eia.doe_dot_gov/neic/quickfacts/quickoil.html .  It doesn't
really talk about how much of the total we've used, but it does say
that in 2001, the US produced 5.8 million barrels of crude oil a day,
and at 31 Dec 2000, there were proven reserves in the US of 22,045
million barrels.  If we continue to produce oil at the same rate
and don't find any more reserves, we'll use up the U.S. reserve
in 2011 or so.  Also in 2001, we were importing 9.328 million barrels
a day.  If we decided to not import any oil anymore, we'd run through
our reserves by about 2004.

Looking at the whole world,
http://www.eia.doe_dot_gov/pub/international/ieapdf/t02_02.pdf says that
in 2000, total world crude oil production was 68.1 million barrels
per day.  Given that and the world estimate at 1.00-1.03 trillion
barrels, this says that if we don't find any more oil and continue
at the current rate of consumption, the world's oil reserves will be
exhausted in around 2040.

The actual time frame will probably be longer than this.  As the
reserves go down, prices go up, which reduces consumption and provides
incentives for oil companies to spend more money looking for more
reserves.  One extension of this that you sometimes hear is that
&quot;we will never run out of oil&quot; -- because the price will get too high
to keep using it at the same rate we do today.

&gt;The original Japanese and Asian cars arriving in the US in the early 70s
&gt;were small and got good mileage.  It would interesting to see how our
&gt;fuel requirements may have been different if they had remained small.

The latest big report from the US government on vehicle fuel economy is
from 1994 and can be found at http://www.eia.doe_dot_gov/emeu/rtecs/ .  To
your question, one chart says that the average fuel economy of 1977-1979
model year vehicles, residentially owned, was 13.9 mpg.  Economy peaked
in the 1986-1988 model year at 21.7 mpg and was down to 20.5 mpg in
1994-1995.

Bus content?  From the above report, &quot;If all vehicles of model years 1979
and earlier were removed from the residential fleet, the overall fuel
economy would only increase from 19.8 mpg to 21.0 mpg. Any major increase
in future years must therefore derive not from the retirement of older
vehicles but from improvements in technology, and buying patterns of
consumers.&quot;  So tune up your Bus and keep driving it, and think about
economy when you're buying a newer car.  :)  VW's turbodiesels tend to
slot in right below the hybrids when it comes to new-car fuel economy.
