Subject: Tent FS &amp; Westy parts request

Bus folks,

I am putting my red/white striped Sundial/EZ tent up for sale, and would like to give any listees first dibs.

It is complete and in good shape.  All poles are present and roof brackets are included.  There are no tears or split seams.  It is a little dusty from camping use.  There are also a few faded areas--check the archives &lt;tent cleaning&gt; and ask Jim's wife about that =)

Overall it is an excellent tent to use for camping.  It is nice, but not too nice to use.  It should be correct for period EZ and Sundial campers ( i've seen the same on both)

I have some pics available upon request and can bring it to Corona de Tuscon or BYOB/KP.  I am asking $300 OBO.  I really don't want to ship, due to the length of the poles, but will- if necessary (shipping is not included in price).

If you're interested, give me a buzz and let's talk..

On to the other bit...
I am looking for the clothes hanger bar that is in Westy long closets.  It is a small aluminum bar, about 4&quot; long with 2 end cap/mounting brackets.
It mounts to the inner roof of the closet to hang clothes.  The one I have is out of a early bay closet, so I'm not sure if they are all the same.  I am looking for 3 or 4 of them.
Actually all I need are the end caps.
So if anyone has any laying around...drop me a line and let me know.

Later,
Beto
