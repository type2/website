hey, i know some of you have late model campers.  i found a 74 or 75 westy
with a really cool propane refrigerator/stove combo.  it's the size of an
earlier icebox unit and goes in the same location(right inside the sliding
door behind the passenger seat).  are these:  a) hard to find, b) worth the
time to pull out and sell, and/or c) of interest to anyone on the list? 
the refrigerator is the lower part, and the built-in stove is hidden under
a flip-up table-top like lid.  it's definitely westfalia, and has that
darkish wood veneer.  it's super clean and complete.
