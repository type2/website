This is probably the issue. I will go through the fuse box this weekend. The
relay for high beams is probably toast too, as it a 6 volt unit. I need to
get this and install my 9 pin 67 box. The 9 pn 6 v is currently working,
sans er flashers, just a solid light for now. I really suspect bad ground to
drivers taillight, going to make a ground harness for both rears to body
ground for brighter rear lights. Also found a toasted wire to the front
parking lights to attend to, those things are SMALL guage!

&gt;After about 9 months of work, I finally have a stock height bus, running
&gt;pretty well.

Congratulations!

&gt;Electrical demons were not fully exorcised,

Whatever you do, don't forget to pay your exorcist in full and on time.
Otherwise you'll get re-possessed...

&gt;Need to fix ground at drivers rear light, and debugg the dead pass
&gt;headlight, as bulb was good.

The headlight trouble is probably in the fuse box.  There are four fuses
for the headlights in all - low/high beam, left/right bulbs.  If the
fuses are OK, the contacts in the fuse box might be loose.  If you find
a loose contact, Eric&amp;Barb recommend soldering *all* the contacts
together.  Use a heavy soldering iron and rosin-core or solid solder -
DON'T use acid-core solder!
