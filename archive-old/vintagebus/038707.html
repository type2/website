    Alas, the poor Tamale (65 Standard) was savagely attacked by a modern
Detroit beast, resulting in severe damage to the rear bumper, right rear
quarter sheet metal, wheel well and associated metal parts.
    Not having skills or tools for body work, I need to find a body shop
that will lower themselves to work on an old bus. Anyone know of a reputable
body shop in the Albuquerque area, other than Duke City, who will do the
work?
    Thanks, and the Tamale thanks you, too.
