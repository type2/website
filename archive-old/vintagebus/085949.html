Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;the hubcap&quot;...

I think that the hubcap should be tranported any way that gets it to where
it needs to be.  The preferable way will be in a bus, but as long as it is
in the care of a VW person we shouldn't get too picky about minor
transport in a non-VW or even in a non-car.  After all, the hubcap has
been moved some distance by humans without any vehicle!

I would hate it if the hubcap missed being at a distant event simply
because the current holder decided to fly to the show rather than
drive their bus.

George
