Subject: paint

There has been some discussion of paint so I thought I would throw in an 
observation. I had some left over white paint from another job. Actually, 
the parts store sold it to me by mistake and, rather than taking it back, 
I used it to spray one side of my bus because it appears to be a dead on 
math to the pearl white that was on it. The paint is standard &quot;Ford 
white&quot; which is really a creamy white. It seems to be a very, very good 
match and , do to it being a standard color, the price is good on it. 
Good info for those of us on a budget more interested in a good looking 
bus than perfect adherance to specs.
