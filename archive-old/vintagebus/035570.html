To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

In response to Bryan Bledsaw's question about disadvantages to wheel adapters 
I can say I have never had good luck with them. Ten years ago I had a '59 
kombi with adapters and I had one break as I was driving down the freeway.  I 
ended up with the front of my bus hanging off the side of an overpass. It 
took two tow trucks to lift me back onto the road.
