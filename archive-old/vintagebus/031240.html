I'd add the following:

Alternator diode pack

1 intake and 1 exhaust valve

increase the fuel hose from 1m to about 5m (siphon hose!)

Add another disto cap and rotor. (they're small and light.)

An inner tube and a tyre repair boot. (for fixing BIG holes in the tyre!)

Ignition coil

About 20 tin screws (they fit in an amazing number of locations) and a
handful of &quot;fender&quot; washers. 8mm x 1.25 x 30mm bolts.

Accelerator cable clamps (at the carb end) x 2 

Carb kit and replacement jets - fuel filters.

If your carb has the electro-magnetic idle jet, replace it with the
correct fixed jet.

Additional lighting, front and rear (I use an implement (tractor) light
for a backup light.)

A couple of 20-30a automotive toggle switches. One spring loaded to
replace any switches that die on the way.

You might want to browse the 1980 version of the Z4 tech recommendation
at the website mentioned in my previous post.  In particular, page 5
&lt;http://wetwesties.tripod_dot_com/Journeys1/05.htm&gt; and page 16 &lt; 
http://wetwesties.tripod_dot_com/Journeys1/16.htm&gt;

These are parts that I'd add were I heading into the interior of Mexico
for an extended journey.

Jim
