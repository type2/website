Subject: 66 Price Opinions revisited
Mime-Version: 1.0

A couple of days ago I posted a &quot;opinions on 66 Bus&quot; on the type 2 
list.  Since that time I've found the Bus does not have Ambulance Fans.
So here's the info on the Bus and please give me your opinions on the 
price.  66 Kombi with rust in the left outer Rocker,  Some minor rust on 
the right Rocker, one very small hole that can be welded shut.  A dent on 
the right rear quarter.  Other wise the Body is in good shape, no rust or 
other dents.  It does not have wiper motor or a motor.  He originally 
wanted $800 but will take $680 (what he says he has in it).  Is it worth 
the $680.  I've done Body work in the past on a professional level so 
that's not a big deal.  I want a Bus for a daily driver and semi Custom.

Dave
