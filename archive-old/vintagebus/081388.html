Subject: Re: [VB] S.E.S. Fuel Injector

Yeah - I agree with you that putting one of those things on your engine 
would almost certainly shorten engine life.  This guy says he used it for 
racing his 72 beetle.  I haven't actually seen this thing yet but he says 
that it is complete - with velocity stack and solenoid etc... I think I'll 
grab it for the novelty - I was just wondering if anyone knew anything about 
these things.
