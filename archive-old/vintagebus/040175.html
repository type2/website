well....
i dont know EXACTLY what the laws are, but up here in the rust belt, 
inspections seem to be non-existant. i live in cleveland and travel south 
often to camp in WV and me and my friends count how many hillbilly pick-up's 
we see. (sorry kelly ;) kinda like punch buggy with sh#t box trucks. it 
would appear that anything with 4 wheels can drive in that state. Ohio is 
like that too though.
