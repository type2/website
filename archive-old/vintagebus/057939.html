Subject: My new tires and wheels

I finally got my new tires and wheels on my DC. They are great! I spent
all of that time collecting the complete set of date stamped (58) crows
foot  rims and the powder coating filled in most of the date stamps.
Bummer! One other thing is to make sure and check your wheels for
trueness BEFORE powder coating. Two of mine were fairly bent. Although
Les Swchab has never mounted a set of rims for me that they have not
said is bent. I think they are to used to looking at new car rims and
not old VW rims. Anyway the 205/70/15 Pirelli Scorpians look and work
great. They have a load range of 1525 and are almost an inch shorter
than stock. They are about 1 1/2 taller than my 165 SR 15's that came
off so it is a good compromise. My speedo is almost right on. (I checked
it with one of those police radar trucks with the &quot;your speed is&quot; sign
in the back). Hopefully I won't have to go through that again anytime
soon. Oh yeah, the tires were $60 each through Tire Rack.
hope this helps,
Craig
