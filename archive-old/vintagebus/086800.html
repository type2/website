Subject: Flasher problem fixed.

Found the problem with my passenger side flashers.

Original problem was that the flashers stopped working when the headlamps 
were turned on.

The problem was with the two active terminals on the rear tail lamp 
assembly. The contacts had gotten bent and were touching one another 
(battery is over there and I had recharged it recently). When the headlamps 
were on, of course the tail lamp was on thereby preventing the flasher from 
flashing.

Thanks everyone for the support!!

And yes, I thought calling them Flashers would be a bit of fun.

Chris
