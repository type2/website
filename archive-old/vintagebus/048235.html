&lt;&lt; 
 Has anyone had experience installing seatbelts in a pre-67 bus (driver
 quality,
 not for show)? Is this an unpardonable sin? Are there kits available or
 must
 seat belts be adapted from another vehicle? Thanks in advance for the
 help. &gt;&gt;
Hi Pat, 
You can get seat belts from junk yards that may or may not be weakened by time
and other damage.  Better yet new ones from the same company (Hickok seat
belts.) that supplied seat belts to VOA in the 60s by ordering these belts
from VWAC parts shops.  These new seat belts even have the VW badge on the
buckle in the form of a sticker, just like the early belts.  They come in lap
or shoulder belts just like the ones you could get at the dealer when your
pre-1968 VW was sold.  The only complaint we have had with these belts is that
the VW badge sticker does not hold up to wear as well as the original sticker,
to aleviate this problem we cover the stickers with clear packing tape or
clear contact paper.  Since safety is very important, installing seat belts
are not a crime especially when you could have gotten the when your VW was
new.  We highly suggest the shoulder belt to keep you face and dash board from
making a good impression on each other in a accident.  At the very least the
lap belts to keep you and folks from flying around violently when you manuver
you VW suddenly.    Eric &amp; Barb
