hello,

I searched both the archive and the library for an answer to my question but 
was not able to find what i am looking for.

My problem is that i am having a hard time getting grease in the front 
kingpin zerk (the one that holds the brake line mount) and the small 8mm 
zerk on the link pin that points forward also.   I always thought that 
grease was supposed come out somewhere and that was how you knew when to 
stop.  The only place that it releaved pressure was on the gun where the 
hose screws in.
Here are the conditions
New Zerks
Last lubed 800 miles ago. Last time it felt like it took some grease, This 
time not much if any.
New gun
When i first got it it pulled all over the road  mechanics said kingpins 
were in to tight.  They have been getting better as they have had more use.
Many many thanks
