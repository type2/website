Hi Woody,
What are you using to check the starter?  Battery charger or fully charged
battery with jumper cables.  The former has not enough amperage and the
latter has it if fully charged.  You should also take off the forward cover,
clean the crud that results from brush dust out of the starter and inspect
the four brushes to make sure they are longer than the cages they are in.
Some rebuild places only install two brushes and this results in less cost
for them and faster wear on the brushes and a bad starter for you sooner.  To
install new or more brushes you have to solder them with a large high watt
solder iron or a propane powered solder iron.  Eric&amp;Barb
