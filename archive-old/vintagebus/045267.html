&lt;&lt; I'm trying to sort out a mess of wiring under the dash and noticed this 
 little box with many wires protruding from it which looks very corroded. 
 What is this thing called so I can replace it and why don't I see it on 
 any of the wiring diagrams I have been able to find? The bus has been 
 converted to 12V, was this added then?
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Bob,
Sounds like your blinker/emergancy blinker box that is pretty much one year
only.  1966 that would be normally 6 volt and the 1967 that would be 12 volt.
Does it have 9 connections to it?  If so you would be better off getting the
replacement kit for about $50.00 that replaces your box with two inexpensive
flasher relays that are easy to get at most auto part shops and some wiring
instead of your $100.00+ cost for NOS blinker/emergancy flasher box.  Plus get
your windshields new rubber and sealant to prevent more water damage or at the
least tarp the front of your bus for right now.  Eric &amp; Barb
