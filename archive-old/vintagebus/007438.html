Hi,
My fuel pump is original and in the last 200k miles I have
only cleaned the screen twice. Both times it looked fairly
clean before cleaning. The pump has around 307k miles on it.

How long do they normally last?

Chris.

&gt; the other day I was looking at the 1600sp motor in my 65
westy.I noticed that
&gt; the fuel filter had more crud in it than I like, and
proceeded to remove it
&gt; for replacement.   Then fuel started dripping out of the
line from the pump.
&gt; just dripping out under gravity feed from the tank.
