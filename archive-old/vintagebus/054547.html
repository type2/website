Subject: Re: [VB] Re: ..speaking of Pucks

Of course that was their attitude.  They did sell
trailers, too!

JP

&gt; westfalia believes that a trailer and a camper are
&gt; needed in certain cases.  quoting from a 1961
&gt; westfalia owner's manual:  &quot;For VW Camper users who
&gt; wish to travel with large families or more than two
&gt; adults we recommend the Westfalia Caravan
&gt; 'Landstreicher 295-4.'  It is very light and easy to
&gt; tow and accommodates four adults.  The caravan can
&gt; also be fitted with a side tent.&quot;  of course this
&gt; has nothing to do with pucks....
