&gt; Watch out for the Bay market, ouch!!! 70 bay clean, not 
&gt; perfect sold
&gt; for 4400.00 to Japan (took half hour to sell once sign went 
&gt; in window), 1970
&gt; bay, new paint, tires, still needed interior work 3600.00 and 
&gt; of course the
&gt; DC for 8 g's plus!!!! 

Wow send them over to me in South Africa! Bay windows are worth next to
nothing here. Sounds like if I could lure some Japanese gentlemen down here
I could retire on the commissions earned from selling unloved, unwanted bay
window campers and 'NOS'bus/Mercedes truck hadlights.
