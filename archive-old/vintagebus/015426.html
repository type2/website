I just recently purchased a new house and am lacking in storage space for my 
VW vehicles.  So until I get a new barn built I was wondering about portable 
shelters.

A while back there was a discussion about a portable shelter sold by COSTCO. 
  I am currently looking at purchasing one and wanted to know what others 
thought of them.   How well do they hold up?  I live north of Detroit and 
want to know if it would last for year around storage or will this not work? 
  How well does it anchor to the ground?  How sturdy is it?

Thanks for any help you might be able to give.
Mike
