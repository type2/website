As far as I know, it's how VW did it from the factory.  It's how my '61 
single cab was and most anyone else that I've talked to who had any 
experience with Pickups has said the same.  Perhaps this is the work of a PO, 
 but I have seen the pop-rivets in quite a few pickups.  They basically 
pop-riveted the strips from the underside so there wouldn't be any 
inconsistancy in the uper surfaces of the strips for things to hang up on.  
I'm not sure if this was a change from a previous method or not.  Does anyone 
else on the list have any further insight into this question?
