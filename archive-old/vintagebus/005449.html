Subject: Anyone need a baywindow adjustable beam?
Date: Wed, 9 Aug 2000 13:25:28 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I've got a brand new (never been installed and sticker still intact)
adjustable front beam for a baywindow bus.  It's got the bracket for the
power booster and I've got a booster I can throw in with it.  I know this is
not the baywindow list but usually the splitty folks know plenty of others
with bays who might be interested.  Since the beam has sat for a long time,
the needle bearings have fallen out so you'll need the torsion needle
bearings out of an existing beam.  You'll need all your parts from your
existing beam in order to move them over.  This is just the bare adjustable
beam (I believe bus boys calls it an albatross beam.)  I need some cash to
buy a neat add on for my 67 bus so I'm asking
$350 or best offer.  I'm in the Beatrice, NE area.  I will ship for
additional cost of someone wants me to.

Pix availble upon request.  Email is silent_at_beatricene_dot_com

NQ

BTW:  Would anyone who is on the type2 baywindow list please forward this
for me?  Thanks!
