&lt;&lt; What should I put it on with?  Spray bottle, rag, cloth, or pour
 it on and spread it around with a foam brush?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
We just put it on straight from the bottle and you can use any devise for 
application.  Even just your hands if you want them softened to.  Then just 
leave it on for at least 30 minutes before wiping off any excess.  Eric&amp;Barb
