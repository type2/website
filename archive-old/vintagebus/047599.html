&lt;&lt; Since you are recommending the counterweighted crank (and I had always
 concidered one), can you enlighten us with a manufacturer of these that
 is reliable?? &gt;&gt;
Hi Less,
As long as they are just a stock welded CW crank and not a stroker we have 
been buying and using just any good condition used one of these so far.  We 
would love to find out where we could get aload of our STD/STD used 1500/1600 
cranks welded up this way.  Also would like to do the same to used STD/STD 40 
HP, 25/36 HP cranks we have.   Eric&amp;Barb
