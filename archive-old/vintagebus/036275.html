Subject: Sold the 67 Westy!
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Got the phone call today from a guy named Kyle in Wisconsin.  Im selling the 
67 westy to him for $4,700.  He will be coming down here in September but 
unfortunately wont be able to spend the first few days of owning the bus 
camping in it at Jerome :(  He will be in the weekend afterward.  But he is 
interested in driving it from here in Phoenix all the way to his home.  
Loooooong trip I think!  So time to start wrenching on it.  Jeez im bogged 
down now between bodywork on the 57, fixing my motor in the 67 kombi and now 
preparing the westy for a trek across the nation!   I wonder how guys like 
Ronnie do this, gotta give them credit.
