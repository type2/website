check the clutch arm return spring.  If broken it will not spring  the pedal 
promptly  back up, which as you found can leave the clutch dragging.   It is 
on the arm on the tranny, you can reach up there and feel for it.     If it 
it broken you should pul the motor and replace it, which means undoing the 
wingnut from the clutch cable end, undoing the circlip holding the arm on 
(the one the cable goes through) and taking it off, putting the replacement 
spring on, and replacing the arm.  Not too bad a deal.  check the fuel line 
and tranny boots while you are at it, easy to refill the trans when the motor 
is out.    In the meantime, pull the clutch pedal up w/ your toe.

 Also sticky cable and pedal assembly in the front don't help.  Grease the 
front suspension every 3K and apply some grease to the moving parts at the 
pedal and brake cables to keep it smoothly moving.  some years have grease 
point for the front pedals  (my 61 has at least)

OK heres the new problem (it seems to be at the rate of 1 prolbem a week :)
I was driving to work this morning and All of a sudden, I realized that the
clutch seemed to be slipping because the rpm's would go way up when you
released the clutch then it would gradually clutch in and the speed would
increase and rpm's drop.... So ok I think to myselfe That Im going to have
to drop out the engine again and fix the stupid clutch... then I was later
looking at the lever it's self and realize it wasn't returning properly and
you could pull it up and get the clutch to work fine when your driving...
Itook some WD-40 to the bolt holding the lever to the body and had Alisa
work the clutch while I was applying  it, It loosened it up a little but
not nearly as much as I would have liked. it still sticks just enough to
affect the action of the clutch. I want to fix it as soon as I can because
I dont like the thought of burning the clutch all the time! If anybody has
had any experiance in this area I would be extreamly greatful to any
information!
Thanks a lot
