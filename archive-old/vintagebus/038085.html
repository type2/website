Hi Paul,
You can check the straightness yourself.  Jack your bus front end up, after 
loosening one of the tires.  Remove tire, and install your rim to test.  Make 
sure to torque to proper amount to keep rim evenly tensioned.  Then if you 
wheel bearings are adjusted correctly you just spin the rim, and see if it 
wobbles side to side of up, and down.  To increase your accuracy in doing 
this you should put a jack stand so it's top is very close to the rim, and 
use a feeler gauge to see how much wobble there is.  These readings can be 
increased in ease and accuracy by using a dial indicator.   Eric&amp;Barb
