&lt;&lt; I Know that when I cruise my bug with the rack there is a small lose of 
power 
 with it on, almost not noticeable. I have heard of full length racks taking 
a 
 mile per gallon away on a bus. Word of warning I have run my rack on my bug 
 loaded with junk and it does create a BIG wind drag. I mean my bug could not 
 break 55 MPH fully loaded rack, it wasn't the weight just the wind drag.
  &gt;&gt;
 Went with couple friends up to Orcas Island to go camping..  We (3) piled in 
my bug.  since the car was pretty full inside, the roof rack got piled with 
packs and tents etc.  Cause we were leaving the bugster at Anacortes and 
taking the ferry on foot to the island.  Anyway, just to do it, I took 
bugster up to 85mph.  When the speed was pointed out to Jen, she freaked.   
Not that I normally drive that fast, I am really a mellow driver most of the 
time.   

I never could do that with a bus though.  (bus content).  But I don't tend to 
put light stuff on bus roof racks., tends to be metal and heavy, and you can 
feel the load.
