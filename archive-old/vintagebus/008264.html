Subject: Value of a bus

Hello all. I usually never pay mind to these type of questions when I see
them on the type 1 list, and yet I find myself asking the same. I am about
to acquire another bus. Another 65 13 window deluxe. I'm trying to get a
rough idea of the value and I will describe to the best of my ability thus
far. First let me mention that I am in Augusta Ga where splitty busses
aren't very common but you can buy a 70's type 1 for next to nothing. It has
usual bus rust. Doglegs starting to go(some pinholes), area below the
nose/behind the front bumper(what is this called?) is gone, corners aren't
too bad but will need replacing. Rocker panel can be repaired on the drivers
side. Not too bad. Passenger side rear rocker panel? area near the rear tire
has a hole about the size of a baseball. It is 100% complete and original
except for the transmission. It has a NEW aftermarket trans with a different
4rth gear in it. Has one rebuilt redux box. Rebuilt dual port engine(well, I
guess that's not original either). Rebuilt brake system. Some slight surface
rust on the roof above the gutters no more than an inch or two up anywhere.
Original paint.(I believe it is seafoam blue and white) Still has jail bars
in great shape. Has a step below the cargo doors that mounts in the
outrigger points(is this rare?). Has the middle seat(is mine worth $2000
too? lol) and back seat. The only thing I noticed missing is the shifter
knob, but it has the extension piece still. A few of the popout latches are
broke, but I have several laying around. Gret front tires, but back ones are
dryrotted. Still has 6volt and everything except the clock works. Any rough
ideas would be greatly appreciated! Thanks again!
