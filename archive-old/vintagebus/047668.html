Hello everybody,
    Actually the 1st &quot;official&quot; that could be considered a REAL modern style 
mini-van (not a camper like the Scarab)  designed for that multi-purpose we 
all know and love was by Chrysler (not to mention some small company that had 
it but was copied). I believe an executive in 1939 wanted a car built on a 
limo frame for that purpose. He sent it to Hercules Bodyworks who did the 
woodies for them at the time and he didn't like the boxy woodie body look. So 
he opted for the limo style and the custom 1 off design they came up with. I 
guess its that exec snob appeal. But anyway in 1940 he got the car back and 
the folks at Chrysler liked it so much they put it into production as the 
&quot;Town and Country&quot; Check out the National Woodie Club   &lt;A 
HREF=&quot;http://www.nationalwoodieclub_dot_com/&quot;&gt;National Woodie Club - Home Page&lt;/A&gt;
 for more info.  Also does anyone know if  might have a canopy for my 
singlecab in decent shape? PLF isn't taking orders right now (some bus 
content)
