Subject: Re:  [VB] vin# placement

ok ..I think I have a problem,I have a 59 DD panel and just checked 
the vin#'s on the title to the vin#'s on the body
on the &quot;m&quot; code plate  vin matches the title as does the longer 
plate in the engine comp.
but the stamped number in the engine comp does not match!
is this the vin # or a body number like a beetle????
am I screwed???if so I may be parting this thing out!
 -- - - - - 
seeing as no one in WA checks the VIN matches the title unless you bring it 
thrugh the inspectors to bring it into state, dont get your knickers in a 
twist.    does the bus run?  you could ask the PO whats up.

How are the M code plate and the plates to the fire wall held on?  stock, or 
replaced?    Yours has an M code tag?   If it has a body number stamped 
behind the seat it will not match the VIN.   How far off are the numbers?    
Does the M code tag description matche sthe bus?   Does the model code on the 
tag say its a DD or a kombi?  Does the DD actually looks like a 59?
