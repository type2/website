Subject: Re: [VB] Does 60-62 shifter have a bigger ball than 62-67?

Thanks Clara! and all!

I did eventually get the shifter in, but the base plate is wobbly. I  
need to figure out how to insert shorter bolts so that it will be  
tighter. But this is the first time I was able to shift gears in 5  
years, so I'm not picky.  So about that - this was a good weekend for  
me - and so I'm pushing the gears and it is really tight and then not  
tight... uh oh.

I get under the back and I remember that when I was 17 (like 25 years  
ago or so), I put in a standard beetle front trans mount and it put  
enough pressure on the rear coupler to cause the shift rods to  
separate. No problem, time to start pulling the mount so I can jack up  
the trans... And while I'm back there, I might as well pull the engine  
to make the trans move easier. Oh and while I'm back there, might as  
well try to get the bay window gas tank in the right way... Which  
amazingly I had time to do. Planets must have been aligned or  
something - actually my wife was taking a long nap and there was  
nobody to inspect the progress on the house projects. :-)

I need to buy a Hazet deep offset wrench for those engine and trans  
bolts though...

&gt; Hey Conrad,
&gt;
&gt; for the stick shift:
&gt; 211 711 121 gear shift lever up to ch 501 706
&gt; 211 711 121 A  gear shift lever from ch 501 707 up to ch 216 028 111
&gt; 211 711 121 B  gear shift lever from ch  216 028 112
&gt;
&gt; the first version is straight, and the ball has no pin for orientation
&gt; the second and 3rd versions have a bend near the botton. They also  
&gt; have a pin that goes into a slot in the socket, to keep the  
&gt; orientation of the stick right.
&gt; the distance from the ball to the cup that holds the spring is  
&gt; different on versions A compared to B
&gt;
&gt; much better to cut the front shift coupler than either of the shift  
&gt; rods.  I have had good luck with heat and then quenching with a  
&gt; squirt bottle, and only once had to cut the coupler... a lengthwise  
&gt; slice or two allows a fat sccrewdriver to pry it apart ... then I  
&gt; was able to seaparet teh front from rear rods.  But hindsight is 20  
&gt; 20, oh well.
&gt;
&gt; For the forward shift rod:
&gt; 211 711 155 up to ch # 501 706
&gt; 214 711 155 from ch # 501 706 up to 835 087
&gt; 211 711 155 B from ch #  835 087 up to 216 028 111
&gt; 211 711 155 C from ch # 216 028 111
&gt;
&gt; looks like WW made a repro shift rod to use in place of either the B  
&gt; or C originals.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; When installing the shift stick, I do it as a two person job, with  
&gt; one person holding the horizontal rod up from underneath, and the  
&gt; other putting the ball in the socket and putting the bolts in.
&gt; Without a person (or block of wood) holding the shift rod up, it  
&gt; will just sink down out of the way.
&gt;
&gt; use grease for the ball and socket joint.   grease is good.  ;)

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I am finally getting back to putting my (65 bus) shifter assembly  
&gt; back together and keep running into snags - but that's nothing new  
&gt; for me.
&gt;
&gt; I bought a 62-67 shift rod from Wolfsburg West and put it in  
&gt; (because I had to cut up the old one to get it off). I'm sure it is  
&gt; the later one because it has the hole in the front for the '67 shift  
&gt; rod guide pin. When I went to attach the shifter, the ball doesn't  
&gt; fit into the shift rod cup. Is the 60-62 shifter ball bigger than  
&gt; the later shifter?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Conrad
