&gt; Hi all,
&gt; Has anyone heard anything about the Madera show this weekend at the Madera
&gt; Fairgrounds. Is this a good show to go to and would it be worth the two
hour+
&gt; drive from the Bay Area to get there.


Don't know how it is recently, but I went down in November '98. It is a SOTO
show, and was pathetic by any standard. Felt sorry for the guy who drove
down from Washington for the show, I felt like it was a waste of time
driving from Modesto (~75 miles). Very light turnout (fewer than 50
vehicles) and people started leaving almost as soon as they got there.

Live fast, die young, leave a good looking corpse.
Oops, too late!
