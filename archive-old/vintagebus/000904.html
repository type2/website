Hi all those with parts books...

I was disassembling the headlight buckets on my 59 double cab so I can send
the beauty rings in to get re-chromed and I noticed that they are different.
One has a part number 221 941 038B and one has 221 941 037A.  The 038B
bucket is white and the 037A is silver.  The other thing is that one of the
beauty rings has the small hold down screw holes close to the bolt tab and
the other has the small screw holes on the opposite sides of the ring from
one another (one close to the tab and one farther away).

So, whats what???

Thanks

David
