Subject: Re: Bay tank into split - filler neck

&gt;From: &quot;Eric Allred, Aircooled.Net&quot; &lt;eric_at_aircooled_dot_net&gt;

&gt;One thing I had to do with my bay window tank, was the breather line
&gt;that is located on the top of the tank, [...]

On Bays, VW put &quot;traps&quot; up inside the C-pillars for the vent lines.
Just like the trap under your sink, but upside down.  If you have
a bay-window Bentley, look at section 3 page 5.  The vent line goes
from the left side of the fuel tank, way up inside the left C-pillar,
back down, across the back by the engine compartment hinges, way up
inside the right C-pillar, back down, and into the tank.  There is
a fitting in the middle (over the license plate) for a hose that
sucks the fumes into the air cleaner.

Sometimes you can see the traps if you peer into the engine air vent
slots of a Bay.  It looks like the tubing you see on refrigerators
and air conditioners.  You can emulate this yourself by running the
vent line from the tank up into the space above the air vents, then
back down to the connection on the gas filler.  Just make sure any
rubber lines can't get cut on sharp corners on the body.  Todd's
posting is along these lines.

On TU's &quot;Mini Baja&quot; car (off-road, tube chassis, 10 hp Briggs engine),
the gas cap has a vent fitting in the center.  Last year, they just
attached some rubber fuel line to this, snaked it back and forth
several times in hairpin curves above the tank, and then ran the
line down the frame to exhaust under the car.  The hairpin curves
catch any liquid fuel that sloshes up there in fast turns (or
roll-over); the bottom exhaust allows vapors to vent and keeps any
liquid that does sneak through from getting on the hot engine.
