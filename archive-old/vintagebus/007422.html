Subject: Universal Case dipstick adapter needed.

One thing that bugged me about this T3 engine of mine is that the dipstick
convertor came out at a real bad place - real close to the pulley - so close
in fact that I was either going to have to wire the stock dipstick out of
the way or wonder when my Berg oiltemp dipstick would get sucked up into the
belt and pulley.   ME thinks I've have a cheap part.  Does anyone have the
correct convertor or know for a fact of a mailorder place that puts the
dipstick tube in either the bug locale or at least farther away from the
pulley?  I kind of need this piece now so I can put on the tin and the Berg
pulley.

BTW:  Anyone know what an H0 case is from?
