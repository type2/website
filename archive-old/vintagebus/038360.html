&gt;Subject: RE: [RV-T] Getting out of the way

&gt;As you suspect, the details vary. Colorado, California, Orgeon and
&gt;Washington have some explicit, posted laws on the topic.  Language
&gt;varies with CA (who else?) apparently having the most explicit
&gt;verbiage. (I actually saw a party being pulled off in CA for an
&gt;apparent violation of the no-parade law!)  Other states, VT for
&gt;example, have fairly vague laws about obstructing the normal
&gt;movement of traffic.
&gt;
&gt;Despite the heated rhetoric this topic generates, I have never found
&gt;any dependable reference to actual regulations.  Ain't it a shame we
&gt;have to have laws requiring courtesy?

&gt;      ==============================================

Will, my honored and respected friend,

I think I can say without reservation that knowledge of the regulations
(for
California) is right up my alley, since I work daily with those
regulations.
I've taken the liberty to extract the section of the California Vehicle
Code
that applies to drivers going so slow as to cause a problem for those
that
are following.  Granted that this is only the California law, but most
other
states will probably have something similar in their statutes:

&quot;Turning Out of Slow-Moving Vehicles
    21656.   On a two-lane highway where passing is unsafe because of
traffic in the opposite direction or other conditions, a slow-moving
vehicle, including a passenger vehicle, behind which five or more
vehicles
are formed in line, shall turn off the roadway at the nearest place
designated as a turnout by signs erected by the authority having
jurisdiction over the highway, or wherever sufficient area for a safe
turnout exists, in order to permit the vehicles following it to proceed.
As
used in this section a slow-moving vehicle is one which is proceeding at
a
rate of speed less than the normal flow of traffic at the particular
time
and place.
    Amended Ch. 448, Stats. 1965. Effective September 17, 1965. &quot;
