Subject: Re: [VB] '64 westy FS on the samba

Does any one have a website or brochure or something that shows the earlier 
(pre SO-42) kits-  I know there is a flip seat, and a icky white formica, and 
the wood with metal trim etc, but have really only a vague concept   Any one 
have something set out that says which kits were available which years and 
what each kit was?  I have a basket case 59 westy with the wood with metal 
trim, and I don't even know what kit it is.

&gt; n my way over to the samba to chk out the previously mentioned '54 FS in 
&gt;  germany, there's also a pretty rusty subhatch '64 westy in Ohio for sale.  
&gt;  There's a pretty good set of pix with it, this must be the &quot;transition&quot; 
&gt;  interior that was used between the SO-34/5, and SO-42 era, no?  Is this an 
&gt;  SO-33?  I've never seen an example of this type of interior, so I thought 
it 
&gt; 
&gt;  was kinda cool.  it looks to me like this interior shared the icebox, 
cargo 
&gt;  door &quot;bathroom&quot; cabinet, and right side side clothes cabinet with the 
&gt;  flipseat westy, but everything else is pretty one of a kind.  The bed 
&gt;  arrangement doesn't look like it would be that comfy either.
