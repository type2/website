I am definitely a novice when it comes to the world of busses, but I am 
learning new things each day. Tonight I had a bummer experience with my bus, 
'66 deluxe 1600sp. The bus always starts on the first turn, until tonight. 
Nothing not even a click, all with the lights still illuminating the night 
sky. Where should I start? Bad relay, wires to check, ignition? I am open to 
any and all suggestions.

Thank you in advance for any help that can get me on my 500 mile roadtrip 
this weekend without having to push start the poor thing each time.
