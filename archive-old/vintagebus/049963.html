Subject: List Outage, Apologies


I wanted to apologize quickly for the list outage, which was evidently
caused because I didn't pay the domain fee for this cycle. Network
Solutions is supposed to give you plenty of notice before they turn you
off, and I got no notice whatsoever, but we've dealt with Network Solutions
before so we know they are not too reliable--I should have been proactive
about it.

David Raistrick took the opportunity of time with no traffic and rebuilt
the server with a current BSD kernel and updated programs, so all in all we
should be better than before. All hail David, Travis Sarbin of
Digital-Galaxy, and Thom Fitzpatrick--we are very lucky to have several
competent UNIX jocks on our side.


	Who, like me, instead of miles,
	    Would rather count the grins and smiles
	        That come from driving day to day
	            Four wheels beneath a cargo bay.
