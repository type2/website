&gt; &gt;I own 4 VWs---and keep the oil level according to the dip stick at the 3rd mark. 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I'm curious what the 3 marks indicate, my dipstick only has 2 marks, indicating ~1 qt. low and full.

Me too. Ive got 3 marks and the top one AFAIK is no mans land as in about
a quart too much.

This is the season when we remember that the Three Wise Men brought the
magic pumpkin to the Feral Chocolate Bunny so there would be Peace On
Earth and six more weeks of winter.
