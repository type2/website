Derrick is a bit on the high side on pricing, but he has to make a living.
He does have a very well kept yard and some interesting vehicles.  He and
Barb are really nice folks.  Try the swap meets first (or other local
contacts) for the best pricing.  Then if you can't find it, Way-Out
probably has it.
