Subject: re:[VB] Tuesday or Friday?

No it's VanBondo's birthday and 48th Anniversary of the One Millionth Beetle
being produced. Howard owes me a beer.
Forget the 30 day chip and the Atkins diet- it's my birthday!
I get one 16oz Bud and the smallest serving of Chunky Monkey known to
man/beast.
Whoo hoo! (And I'm known as a radical...)
Middle age is more like it.

Fancy vehicles and Fancy lovers are more proned to theft, cause worry and require more maintenance. 
A dependable daily driver in each case may lead to a happier life after the final analysis.
