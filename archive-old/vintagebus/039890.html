Hi List,

I have a friend at work that has a 1970 Camper and is looking for a new 
1600cc dual port motor.   He is really looking for a NEW not REBUILT engine. 
  He purchased the bus about 3 months ago with a rebuildt engine and the 
whole thing is falling apart!  The heads are separating from the block and 
the block itself is coming apart.  Needless to say, he is willing to spend 
the money and get a NEW engine.  To me it seems that he is looking for a new 
from VW mexican motor.   Is something like this available?  Anyone have 
suggestions on where to get a good solid reliable motor?

He was just recently looking at GEX and was going to purchase one from there 
but I just got done talking him out of that.  He has also called Bus Boys 
but they were unable or unwilling to tell him if the engines they sold had 
new heads or rebuilt heads and from what company the engine was rebuilt.

I unfortuanately like used parts and do the economical scavenging to keep my 
busses running, so I don't have any experience in purchasing new motors.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks,
Mike
