Subject: Highway Speeds

Hello all,

My name is Chris, Im new to the type 2 scene but have owned 4 v-dubs before 
by 67' Micro.  Anyway, I am running a stock 1600 in my bus right now an live 
in Northern Cali where there are some hills here and there on the 101.  My 
question is, is it all right to drive 70 mph and sometimes 75 when im going 
down a slight decline?  my engine sounds fine when im going that fast and I 
dont mantain that speed for too long.  another thing is,  i live pretty much 
on a highway, so when i drive its usually &quot;into town&quot; so i usually have to 
get Shirly (thats her name) up to speed (about 60) within about a .25 miles, 
she seems to be able to handle it and most of my miles are highway, but am i 
running her too hard?  Thanks...

Chris
