Subject: 63 to 64 emergency brake cable housing different lengths ?

After the  Big nut trans swap into the '63 the 64-67 E- brake cable housings
are (about 22&quot; long)  to short( 9&quot;or so) to go from the BACK of the backing
plate to the metal tubes on the body.  Does anyone remember if the &lt;63 and
the 64&lt; cable housings are the same length ? Or if the metal tubes on the
body are different lengths toward the back (&lt;63 to 64&lt;)? I want to use the
cable housing with the right ends to keep water out of the tube end and the
backing plate end...    any ideas ?
