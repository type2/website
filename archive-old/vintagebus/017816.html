Whats this?  Ronnie with a &quot;guage&quot; in one of his VWs?  I don't believe it.  Can't be the same guy ;-)

Uh....Ronnie.  Solvang's not this weekend, its the weekend of the 29th-1st.

I think the speed of your new tranny is distorting your memory :-)

Steve 


&lt;I just ordered a
Tach so i can see my rpm's at my speedo indicated speed. This is a very
interesting combo and will report more on it after I drive solo to the
Solvang show this weekend. If anybody wants to see it, come see me at
Solvang.
