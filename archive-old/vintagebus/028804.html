Hey,

Since I've had a few days off, and I finally got the '62 DC all dialed
in and running sweet, I figured I do some work with her like she was
intended for.  I've got her loaded down with brush, bricks and tree
stumps.  The back end wheel  wells are down past the tops of the rims
(15's).  Since today is the 4th, and I won't be able to go to the dump
till tomorrow, will I do any permanent damage leaving the weight in the
bed for a day or so??  Silly question I know, but I don't want to screw
up the torsion springs or anything like that.   Thanks.

Steve
