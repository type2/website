 &gt; Hello,
 &gt; If anyone could tell me where I can get wheel cylinder rebuild kits for
 &gt; my 62 bus, it would be greatly appreciated.
 &gt; I've tried Busdepot, Wolfsburg West, Rocky Mountain, West Coast Metric,
 &gt; and someone at BFY Obsolete Parts is looking around for me as they did
 &gt; not have them either.
 Issaiah,
 
 I did a lot fo research on this, and finally came to the conclusion that
 the same front rebuild kits fit all busses from 55-70.
  &gt;&gt;
I second that.  both 3/55 through 62 and 63 through 67 buses front wheel 
cylinders, though two different types ( 4 if you count left and right as 
well), are both 25.4, according to the parts list.  WHich also lists
 p/n 211 698 411, repair kit for wheel cylinder 25.4 , from ch 20-117 902.

have bought brake rebuild kits for about $2. 

they work good if it is just the seals that are bad.  If it has rust pits, 
they do not work so good, but if you have wheel cyls that are still smooth 
and unpitted inside, great.   I had some cylinders on the left front warp so 
bad  (due to a bad rubber brake hose) that when I was stranded w/o foot 
brakes I ended up getting rebuild kits, new shoes, and sanding the inside of 
the cylinder until the piston fit again..  pretty bad.
