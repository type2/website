&gt; Were there others????  The parts book seems to lack detail in this area.

My 62 has 4.  Two are are forward over the front seat and meet at the short
airbox.  Then there are 2 more that meet in the middle at the overhead
light.  They are not aluminum like the ones in my '65 Westy, but are made
out of the same material as the overhead panels.
