OH !!! So now you are talking to me. Now I have proof that you sold me a van 
with NO paper work after you told me it had the correct title. AND...I said 
from the start that there was no paper work on the buggy. AND...I never 
received the corners that you and Earl promised me.

Damn shame people have to do people wrong...dont ya think?

Now this along with ever email I sent to you and ones you sent to me are in 
my archive. That way folks can see what was said...BOTH ways.

David

OH, and as far as the slander goes, I can email all that notes that I talk 
about above. THEN you will see who is telling the truth and who is doing the 
slander.

All I want is whats fair...The proper title I was TOLD the van had and also 
the nice rear corners off of a '67 bus that were said to be in great shape.

Anyone want proof...email me off list please.

&gt;everything sems to  boggle your mind. You must be a little off in the
&gt;brain.At least thats what most of us on the list think.After all you
&gt;always write some none sence to the list after i write some thing.After
&gt;all you traded my bud a panel with no paper and corners for a buggy with
&gt;no paper, seemed like a fare trade to me.I'm fed up with you imature
&gt;remarks myself.I' sure everyone else is,so quit crying and deal with it!
