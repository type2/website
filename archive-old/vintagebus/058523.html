Subject: Re: [VB] SOTO is Back, eh?

Hey, don't leave out the Buskatiers_dot_com, we have a number of members in
SoCal and Aridzona area!!  'Course we may have skimmed the cream off the
top, we have some really neat people out there.

&gt; 
&gt; I'm seeing rumblings on the 'net that SOTO is back.
&gt; Is it relevant?  How many bus clubs can SoCal support?
&gt; OCTO, NEATO, SV2 (aren't they in SoCal?).   It seemed
&gt; to me to be that OCTO was the be-all/end-all, with
&gt; the backing of the biggest names in da bidness.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have (let's say) 5 bus clubs, and everyone in
&gt; a given geographic area is in each of the clubs, do
&gt; you really have 5 clubs?
&gt; 
&gt; If a bus A leaves Seattle travelling at 105kph, and
&gt; bus B leaves Lake Havasu travelling at 120kph...
&gt; 
&gt; Ramblings of a sleepy systems administrator...
