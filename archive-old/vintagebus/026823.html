Subject: Gauges &amp; Senders...

I was wondering if anyone could possibly solve this one.  I recently
replaced my gas tank and sender.  The sender that they gave me did not
look like the old one.  The old one was a tube with a slider, and the
new one looked like a toilet shut off float.  The people who sold it to
me said it would work fine with my 67.  The old gauge did'nt work either
so I replaced that as well thinking what else is there to fix?  My gas
gauge still does not work.   The weird thing is that when I took the new
sender out along with the new gauge, both the old set (sender + gauge)
and the new set did exactly the same thing.  When both are tested
sending the sender wire to ground, the gauge goes from extreme full to
empty.  When only the ground and the hot lead are wired, it will quickly
jerk to extreme full(both gauges).  When both gauges are tested with
both senders out of the tank, as the floater is moved the gauge will
move only in the opposite direction that it should.  And, neither gauge
will read farther than half full, even though I am moving the sender
from extreme empty to extreme full.  Both gauges range only from half
full (when it should be pointing to empty) and completely empty (when it
should be reading full).  Weird.  Does anyone think that this is my
sender freaking out or the gauge or both?  Is it possible I shorted out
the new gauge?  Are they extremely sensitive?   ahhhh.
