&gt; It is because three shims act as a sort of bearing...basically protecting
&gt; the case. The one in the middle theoretically isolates the one that  is
&gt; against the FW and the one against the case.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Um, no.  You should use exactly three shims...no more, no less.
&gt; &gt; There is a
&gt; &gt; technical reason for using exactly three (I think it has to do with the
&gt; &gt; rotation), but VW clearly states that you should always use three shims.

We all have heard and read about the 3 shims but considering the info that
the same basic engine in a porsche uses one(1) shim, and John Cs? post
about often using 1,2 or even no shims I have to wonder if these urban
legends, these old wives tales as it were were created just to justify the
3 shim dogma? 
I pray to thee shims of the holy trinity. Not 1, nor the counts of 2 nor 4
shall be blessed. Only 3, the sacred # of the shims shall be.
