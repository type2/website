The eyesore equation is usually a local city/town ordinance. I suggest talking to town hall to see if it actually on the books there. The law is usuaally written so that you may not keep an unregistered vehicle on your property (in the open). You may keep it garaged. If you have enough room on your property, you may be able to get a cheap shed or temporary canopy type object to cover over the unregistered bus. Or you could just register it. I have no idea how much either of these cost?
