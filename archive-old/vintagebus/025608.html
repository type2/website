Greetings list:

 Let us look at the 1966 bus middle seat and the 1967 middle seat one
more time.  The  distance between the outer seat rails on the seats have
been measured and my findings conclude that yet another piece of
equipment was solely produced for the 1967 bus.  The distance for the
1966 seat is approx. 43 inches and the distance for the 1967 middle seat
is approximately 38 inches.  The arm rest for the two seats are also
different.  The 66's arm rest connects to the backrest of the seat and
to the top of the seat rail.  The 67's seat rest connects only to the
back of the seat rest.  A couple people have pmailed me with advise and
I would like to thank them for their help.
