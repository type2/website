Question?

While returning from central Oregon last week, (100 + temps) the oil light 
began to glow, this is a 1776, single carb 34pict, has 10 thou balanced with 
a CW.

I pulled over &amp; shut off the engine, I checked the oil sensor wire &amp; wiggled 
it some, the spade connector moved slightly, anyway started it back up &amp; 
heard nothing except a smooth sounding 1776, the light stayed off, I didn't 
mention it but when I spritz water on the pulley &amp; case sizzle...sizzle, way 
to hot. Timing is correct, no obstructions in the fan.

I let things cool about 20 min &amp; took off, Hears the Question If you open the 
heater box's (heat on) will this help to run cooler?  In this instance I 
would say no, as the oil light came on after a short while. When I shut the 
heater box's I think it ran cooler? as the oil light never came on again, 
although the engine was still to hot, I have no gauges, only 35 years of 
driving air cool buses &amp; bug's &amp; I know what hot smells like.

How about some input from the &quot;real&quot; hot place, Ronnie?
