Hi all,

Well, after getting the message about the berg memorial cruise to Denver
this summer, I now have an incentive/deadline to get my double cab back on
the road...

So, does anybody have any recommended plating shops here in the northwest,
I'm actually in north east Oregon but consider Portland, Seattle, Boise,
etc. as reasonable places to take parts to.

I'm also looking for a good powder coater to send the window frames etc. to
that can do the correct Dove Blue color.

Oh, BTW, I'm also looking for a straight rear gate.  I believe that any gate
from '59 to 67 either from a single or double cab will do.

Thanks in advance.

Dave

59 crewcab (current project)
64 bug        (long range goal)
66 bug        (for the kids when they get to high school)
75 scirocco (race car)
93 eurovan  ( ' HER VW ' )
98 beetle    ( ' 1 MO VW ' )

(only two run at the moment... guess which ones!!!)
