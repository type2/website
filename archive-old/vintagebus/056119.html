Subject: Re: [VB] carb jetting - new concept for me ??

Hi there,

Are you sure it's the Bocar?
Some other questions related to high heat situations first....

Is the exhaust pipe color gray or rich black? This will indicate need for
jet changes....
Are all the engine compartment seals in place with no holes in the sheet
metal?
Is the engine timing correct to specs??

Subject: [VB] carb jetting - new concept for me ??


&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I've noticed several mentions of correct carburetor jetting and have to
&gt; admit I'm pretty clueless about it.  I am wondering if perhaps this is the
&gt; source of my persistent overheating (running at around 260+ in summer on
&gt; long (2 hours or more) highway drives at speeds of 50-55mph).
&gt;
&gt; The carb I am using is a Bocar 30 pict-1, sold by Cal Imports as a Solex
but
&gt; I guess it's an aftermarket equivalent???  Straight out of the box about 3
&gt; years ago.  I'm running a 1600 sp engine, 009 distributor.  Anyone have a
&gt; guess as to whether I need to change the jet?  And are we talking about
the
&gt; one behind the float bowl drain plug or???
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Diana
