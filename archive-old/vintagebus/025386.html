Hello, in reference to the logo, bubble head logo, I was making shirts,
and I believe Wolfsburg owns the bubble head guy, and how they can stop
you from using the VW logo, is beyond me.  I think the logo acts as free
advertisement for volkswagen.  My club went to the dealership, and got
their permission, and sponsorship, as they are members too.....
