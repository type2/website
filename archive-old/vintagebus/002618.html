&gt;Hopefully one day I'll make it over there to where you Aridzona
&gt;folks are and meet some of the members of the BIGGEST VW Club in the
&gt;world (isn't that what the article in Hot VW's said?) You guys are
&gt;awesome!!! Keep on bussin!

Hope you do come, make it to Jerome. Had a couple from Florida win the long
distance award this year in their bus. I seriously doubt that the ABC is the
largest VW club in the world, it is a NEATO chapter. That by itself would
make NEATO larger. The ABC may well be the largest VW club in Arizona,
though, and many are listees. Jerry might be a member of the most VW clubs
in the world!!! Has enough patches on his jacket to make another jacket. And
if someone has a bigger bus event that the JEROME JAMBOREE, I don't know
what it is. Buses by the Bridge is making a run at it in January, we'll see
how they do. I'll be there with bells on. Gotta git the Westfailure rigged
to beat the Van Bondo Resto From Hell trophy whore/Hot VW's centerfold in
the best campsite contest. Gonna pit the authentic, detailed, vintage style
against the butchered, obscene, blasphemous, Hawaiian flowerdy shirted and
V8 powered. We'll see if he's got game or not. It's gonna take more than a
Puck trailer, Mr. Van Bondo!!! Better git busy!!!
