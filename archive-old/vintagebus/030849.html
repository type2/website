Subject: Everybus Carabus

Hi Volks,
Well, the time is near!  Ihave been trying to go to Everybus for the
past two years and something has always hindered my plans.  I am going
to make it this year, if I have to walk!  I have been looking at all the
folks that are posted on The Everybus sight.  I do not see why we all
can't meet up along the way if time allows.  I'll be heading to Harpers
Ferry, WV for Thursday night.  Friday, I plan to meet up with Jeff F.
and the Canadian Connection at 10:00 in Round Hill, VA.  The plans are
to meet others in Opal, VA at The Sheetzs on Rt 29.  Lets give Virginia
and North Carolina a wonderful sight to see.  I would love to arrive in
style in a 20 plus carabus.  I know there are already going to be 10.
Try and join us.  Sheetz in Opal, VA between 11:00 and 11:30 on Friday.
Be There!  Anyone bringing the yougins?  My 5 year old daughter is
excited ;0)

Thanks
Jamie Auch
