Hey,

Don't pound on it! You could damage the bearings in the steering gear
box. The hub  is made of aluminum. Once soaked with penetrating oil.
You should lightly heat up the  center with a torch or hot water. The
aluminum will expand more than the steel and help to loosen things up.
Once heated, use a large gear puller. Another way is to drill and tap
a couple of 5/16-18 holes into the flat areas down inside of the hub,
then take a 1/2&quot; thick piece of steel about 2&quot; wide, drill and tap a
1/2-20 hole in the middle, drill 2 clearance holes to match the
5/16-18 holes. Bolt down the steel bar, install a 1/2-20 bolt and
screw it down against a heavy washer on top of the steering column.
This should pop the wheel off. And hey, no damage to the plastic.
