I have USAA and they didn't say anything about ACV to me.  They just told me
that my vehicle in good condition was worth $5,600.  Since I paid $4,400 I
didn't argue.  I will check my policy again and see.  I drive my dblcab
everyday (don't tell anyone just in case :-) They also never noted the
mileage I don't think.  Even if they did who is to say I didn't change the
speedo out?  They do break on occasion.  Insurance agencies are nothing but
organized (unorganized) crime made legal.

&gt; Almost got hit again this weekend and started to think about insurance
&gt; again......
&gt; I just got done searching the archives and wanted some current
&gt; info.  If any
&gt; one has insurance for replacement cost of your bus not ACV.  Please let me
&gt; know the Co. I live in South Carolina so any national co would be
&gt; better for
&gt; me. I do not want antique ins as I DRIVE my bus.  I just want to try and
&gt; replace her if something happens.  My ins co, USAA, refuses to do anything
&gt; other than ACV.  I had a long argument with the lady that Actual
&gt; Cash value
&gt; should be what I would actually have to pay to get one.  Make
&gt; sense to any one
&gt; else.  You try finding a decent '65 21 window deluxe and tell the seller
&gt; you'll pay him blue book for it.  If there are any takers out there let me
&gt; know. I don't mind getting her appraised but USAA didn't even
&gt; want to go for
&gt; that.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry to vent but I just want to protect my baby and the Ins co's
&gt; don't want
&gt; to help.  I tried calling a couple of the numbers from the last time this
&gt; thread came up and they were either for trailer queens or would
&gt; not insure in
&gt; my state.
