Subject: Re: [VB] windshield, ventwing glass prices?

FWIW, the vw splitty glass with the sekurit logo is tempered and hard to 
break.  theses were used everywhere but windsheilds in 67  us buses.   So if 
you were prying rthe lip of the rubber out to push the seal out withhe glass 
that works for the tempered/sekurit glass, but not the laminated windsheilds 
glass.  laminated glass you decided whether you want to save the glass or the 
seal, usually you just cut the old crusty seal.  

the wing window glass would not be worth much sekurit,   windsheilds that are 
not chipped or cracked or deep scratched, especially if they or sigla or 
delog  are worth more.   getting a windsheild cut can be $25 to $65 per piece 
depending on the glass shop, and original glass fits better than repro.  Used 
repro glass I think is worth less than real VW.  $80 a pair used?  $40?   
throw the wing glass in with it?    Of course, if someone were not my buddy, 
I would not let them have my spare original windsheilds, as they do 
occasionally need replacement.  You could call glass shops and find their 
prices on cutting windsheilds.  unless you really want the original logo, do 
realise new glass does not have thousands of scratches that create a haze 
especially at night.

&gt;     I am needing both front windshields and the passenger side vent wing 
&gt;  window for my '67 kombi.  I have a friend who has all the pieces but 
doesn't 
&gt; 
&gt;  know what to ask.  Of course, I want to get them as cheap as possible but 
I 
&gt;  don't want to rip him off.  I searched several of the bus parts websites 
and 
&gt; 
&gt;  didn't see any glass so I was wondering approximately, what these might be 
&gt;  worth.  They are the original VW glass in pretty good condition but one 
&gt;  windshield has a few small bubbles along the edge.  Any input or opinions 
&gt;  would be appreciated.
&gt;     I removed the 6 side windows and rear windows without any problems, but 
&gt;  when I got to the wind shields, I used the same technique, and immediately 
&gt;  cracked the heck out of both of them.  They were very thin un-VW glass.  
Oh 
&gt;  well.  I know there is lots of information on installing them so I'll 
search 
&gt; 
&gt;  the archives for that.
&gt;  
&gt;  thanks,
