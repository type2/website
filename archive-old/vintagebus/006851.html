A customer of long ago walks into my shop this morning and after seeing a
couple of my splits proceeded to tell me this story.

A rich friend of his in the hills of Los Angles had a 58 Binz that he had
purchased 10 years ago for $3000.00 dollars, a couple years of driving it
and the thrill was gone and he parked it. After sitting for 6 or 7 years he
got it back out and started it, thinking of selling it instead of letting it
rot, he had mentioned this to a few friends and family members and the
feeding frenzy began, becoming disenchanted with the way things were going
on the sale of this vehicle he said &quot;the hell with you all&quot; and donated it
to the GOOD WILL or some organization of the same caliber, so if any of you
are in the Pasadena, Cali. area start looking at the Good Will or like
organizations in the area and you might just find this 58 BINZ, this all
took place less then 2 month's ago.
