Subject: More pictures of my trailer

Some have asked, so i have posted 2 more pictures of
my folding trailer on VW planet.  My plan right now is
to get the trailer ready for the road.  I plan to have
a new top made for it that looks like my bus.  If
anyone is at the upcomming OCTO meet, the bus and
trailer will be there.

OCTO is Feb 10, 2002.  New location is Huntington
Beach High School parking lot.  Main &amp; Utica.

Thanks
Matthew
