&quot;It's not for me, I'm asking for a friend&quot; - you've heard that one, right
along with &quot;no dude, I have an eye infection...&quot;

&gt; I'm sure you realize this Thom - but, why not just call your local motor

&gt; across the border - unless, of course, you plan on filling it with B.C. bud
&gt; first.
