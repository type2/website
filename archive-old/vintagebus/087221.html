Subject: Re: [VB] Does 60-62 shifter have a bigger ball than 62-67?

Hey Conrad, 

for the stick shift:
211 711 121 gear shift lever up to ch 501 706
211 711 121 A ?gear shift lever from ch 501 707 up to ch 216 028 111?
211 711 121 B? gear shift lever from?ch? 216 028 112

the first version is straight, and the ball has no pin for orientation
the second and 3rd versions have a bend near the botton. They also have a pin that goes into a slot in the socket, to keep the orientation of the stick right.
the distance from the ball to the cup that holds the spring is different on versions A compared to B

much better to cut the front shift coupler than either of the shift rods.? I have had good luck with heat and then quenching with a squirt bottle, and only once had to cut the coupler... a lengthwise slice or two allows a fat sccrewdriver to pry it apart ... then I was able to seaparet teh front from rear rods.? But hindsight is 20 20, oh well.

For the forward shift rod:
211 711 155 up to ch # 501 706
214 711 155?from ch # 501 706 up to 835 087
211 711 155 B?from ch #? 835 087 up to 216 028 111
211 711 155?C from ch # 216 028 111

looks like WW made a repro shift rod to use in place of?either the B or C originals.


When installing the shift stick, I do it as a two person job, with one person holding the horizontal rod up from underneath, and the other putting the ball in the socket and putting the bolts in.
Without a person (or block of wood) holding the shift rod up, it will just sink down out of the way.

use grease for the ball and socket joint.?? grease is good.? ;)

Hi,?
?
I am finally getting back to putting my (65 bus) shifter assembly back together and keep running into snags - but that's nothing new for me.?
?
I bought a 62-67 shift rod from Wolfsburg West and put it in (because I had to cut up the old one to get it off). I'm sure it is the later one because it has the hole in the front for the '67 shift rod guide pin. When I went to attach the shifter, the ball doesn't fit into the shift rod cup. Is the 60-62 shifter ball bigger than the later shifter??
?
Thanks,?
Conrad?
