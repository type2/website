Subject: Type 2 Shifter Extension?
Message-ID: &lt;ec008bdd.2497d148_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi All,

While at the VW Classic this weekend, we noticed quite a few Type 2's with a 
shifter extention.  It was kind of a bent tube that brought the shifter 
closer to you so that you dont need to lean forward to shift.

Any idea where one of them might be found?

Peggy would be REAL pleased :)
