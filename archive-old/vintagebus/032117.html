&lt;&lt; is it true that I could actually see a slight speed increase from running 
15&quot; rims on the rear? &gt;&gt;
Hi Virge,
Anytime you increase the outside diameter of the rear tires you use the speed 
of the VW increases at the same engine RPMs.  If you increase the size of all 
four tires at the same time the speed will increase but still read the same 
on the speedo due to the same RPM of the engine to the RPM of the tires 
ratio, but traversing more distance due to bigger circumferance per turn of 
the tires.   Eric&amp;Barb
