Ah, thanks for the suggestions, Eric, Barb, and Kevin.  Should have it 
working tonight.

&gt;Hi Kevin,
&gt;Yes you can!  You need to measure with a straight edge the distance from 
&gt;the
&gt;forward end of the pressure plate and the forward surface of the engine 
&gt;case
&gt;where it mates to the tranny.  Then using the same tools measure the rear 
&gt;of
&gt;the bell housing  surface where the engine case mates up to the rear of the
&gt;clutch throw out bearing nearest to the fork that holds it is best.  What 
&gt;you
&gt;want is the measurement of the tranny to be 1/8&quot; (4mm) longer than the
&gt;measurement of the engine/clutch measurement.  This at worse results in a
&gt;clutch cable needing to be adjusted a turn or two!  Not the five to fifteen
&gt;minute adjusting and checking back and forth, up and down!
