Subject: WINDOWS 98 INSTALL TIP

This is a stretch that this is VW related, but I think it is important.
It is related to the support of the list. If I can save a fellow
subscriber a lot of headaches it is worth it. My guess is most of the
subscribers to this list, myself included, use WIN95 to run your
computer. I am going to upgrade to WIN98 when I can get it for a lot
less than $80. I have been a little apprehensive because of some reports
of install problems.  A recent column by Jim Seymour in PC Magazine has
a tip to fix most of the install problems we might encounter. When WIN98
is installing itself a program called the Version Control Manager, VCM,
cleans up any old, outdated or nonstandard drivers by backing up the old
ones and installing Microsoft safe (?), up-to-date drivers. These do not
always work. If you install WIN98 and a peripheral starts acting up -
scanner, sound card, CD, modem here is what you do. Click on
Start/Programs/Accessories/System Tools/System Information/Tools/Version
Conflict Manager.  A small window should open that lists every file the
VCM &quot;updated&quot; during the install.  Just click on the files you want
returned to their original state and you should be back in business.  If
your modem is what stops working .... well let's just say when my
hardrive crashed and I went to rebuild my system and the only driver
that Micron did not include was for the modem, I was not happy.
Enough computer techno stuff, back to much more interesting motorhead
stuff, any questions catch me at - babichrt_at_gte_dot_net
