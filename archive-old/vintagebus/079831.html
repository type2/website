Subject: 61 rear brakes (turning Drums)

Finally got the rear axles nuts off my DC so i can
rebuild the rear brakes.  I have looked in all my
manuals and checked the archives but have not found
the actual diameters that the drums can be at and
still be turned.  Anyone have these?  This is for a
small nut rear end.

Thanks
