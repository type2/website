i am planning on fixing up my bus interior. It is not a Westy interior, it is
an EZ-Camper-in relatively good condition, but i plan on slowly replacing most
of the interior.

As i replace each part I will try to make drawings of it, which I will be
happy to share with anyone interested.

Unfortunately I am not sure when I will get to this, but I should definitely
be starting this summer. I will probably start with the easiest parts
first...and work from there.

If interested p-mail me around June.
