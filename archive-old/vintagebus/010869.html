You know what Oly and making woopie on the beach have
in common don't you??  

Sorry- its an old joke around here.

Next time you come down to see your sister you might
try the Fish Tail brewery and pub just north of downtown.
There are plenty of excellent local and regional breweries
here in the Puget Sound.  Give 'em a try- I know I sure do!
