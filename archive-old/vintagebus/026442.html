&gt; hey guys, I finally found out who was lurking in my town with a
&gt; bus...and they need to sell it fast to get money to tour with.
&gt; and its on the vintage list because...68 and 69 are vintage now...hehe
&gt; (that 30+ years thing ;) and the 71 is a real close call to being
&gt; vintage.

So &quot;vintage&quot; is a rolling concept these days? :) So is is a 80 vanagon
gonna be vintage in 2010? Thom, you're gonna need to update the
vintagebus tech pages to include balljoin replacements? :)
