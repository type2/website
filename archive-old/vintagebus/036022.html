filler neck.  Can I Cold chisel around this thing? I don't know if there is 
gas in there. Should I fill it with water? I would like to try and salvage 
the tank and as many other sheet metal and other parts as possible. &gt;&gt;

Hi Les,
Remove gas tank from bus and then cut off sheet metal!   Eric&amp;Barb
