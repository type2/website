My '60 is $35/yr here in California, and I don't even have to go down to
the courthouse; they insist that you mail in your registration.

Plus, we're getting a significant discount on future registrations, don't
know the exact amount yet.  This last year they mailed checks for the
refund, but that cost millions to do; it was done so certain politicians
could have their name on the letter that came with your check!

&gt; I love Nebraska sometimes.  I just got back from the courthouse and
&gt; purchasing tags for my 67 bus which are good for another year!  $25.00 is
&gt; all it took - no fuss, no muss, and no charge for looking up your
&gt; registration if you forgot to bring your old one in.
