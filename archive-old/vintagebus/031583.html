Subject: Re: [T2] Doormobile, Rivera ?

&lt;&lt;I am very tired of the televised Men on the Street proclaiming that
some
of our freedoms must be abridged to fight terrorism. That itself
terrifies me. We must have more freedom now, not less. Liberty entails
risks, but its contraries ensure disaster.&gt;&gt;

I swore to myself that I would keep my posts to bus topics only, but the
above post compells me to respond. Because I too am concerned about our
freedoms being attacked. The simple truth of it is that, once again,
there were laws on the books that could have been enforced and things
could have been done to prevent this. The job the FBI did before this
incident was nothing less than scandalous. They knew that Americans were
targets and they also had these guys on their &quot;watch list&quot;. What does a
&quot;watch list&quot; mean. . . we are gonna sit back and watch them destroy our
country?! They also knew Osama was training young men. Yet the
immigration service allowed young men from that part of the country to
enter without scrutiny. And followup. The INS reportedly does not even
have a computer system in place to aid in tracking the movements of
immigrants and their status of whether they are still here legally or
illegally. On top of all that, recently the FBI reported that hundreds
(thousands) of its computers, with the info on the hard drives, were
stolen. They dont have GPS tracking units in these computers? If not,
why not? They also had prior reports that the airport security was a
joke. Repeatedly they were told this and made no changes. I know much of
this may seem like twenty/twenty, but they are being paid to anticipate
these things, not to prop their feet up with another jelly donut. Last
year, when my wife scheduled a trip to New York City for us, I was
privately concerned about the possibility of terrorist attacks, as I
have been for a good many years. If it was a concern of mine, it should
also have occured to someone there. But instead of shaking up the
department and demanding accountability; instead of rolling a few heads
in the department, the administration instead makes our liberies a
target. It may be that the wiretap laws need to be changed, but what of
the accountability of our police forces? It is time to end the hero
worship and demand some answers.

As to the important stuff, the bus stuff. I am having trouble seperating
some sheet metal. Where the panel that has the vent meets the back
corner, it seems to be weded on the entire length. I have tried to
seperate with a cold chisel, a hacksaw, a sawzall and even a
screwdriver, all with little success. Any suggestions from listees? I
know someone has done this before.
