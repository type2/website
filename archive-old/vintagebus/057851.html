Subject: Re: [VB] FW: Special Announcement from Volkswagen of America and Canada!

&gt;From: Thom Fitzpatrick &lt;thom_at_calweb_dot_com&gt;
&gt;Someone on RAMVA got a letter from a company called &quot;Continental&quot; asking=

for $XXXX for infringement.  They told them to go to hell. Contintental
cam back with &quot;how about $X-$Y?&quot;  At which point they were told to go to
hell again.  The third time they came back with &quot;make offer&quot;
&gt;
I offer $26,758.49.

I will expect the deposit in my bank account by end of business today.

Thank you for your prompt attention in this important matter.
