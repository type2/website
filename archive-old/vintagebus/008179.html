I drive my bus to work, and since the time change I am making the evening
commute in the dark.  I have noticed that the red light has a very slight
glow.  I have noticed that it tends to go away then I hit sustained higher
RPMs as well (like when I am going 35 MPH in third gear).

Is this 'normal', or is my generator on the way out because it can not
generate enough 'juice' compensate for the headlights/tail lights, etc?
I  ask this because I have never driven a VW of any kind before a few months
ago, and I dont have a (VW) point of reference except for you wonderful
people out there.
Thanks in advance, and have a great holiday weekend!
