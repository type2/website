Been down here since Friday morning.... but been relaxing a bit. I wanted to
post about the trip...

Worst trip I have ever taken... non stop guests of 30 MPH from all
directions... all the way through Washington, Oregon, Northern California
and all of Mojave.  Across the Mojave at 3:00am we had to hold the steering
wheel at 20 degrees to the left and drive on the center line to stay on the
road!  WIND WIND WIND.

No major problems... now have 6000 miles on my bus in only 2 months.  This
was a bus parked for 10 years in Northern California... Thom and Tom in
Sacramento helped me get it on the road in record time....

Along the way... my passenger tires were driving me crazy... had to sleep
after driving every 3 hours due to the stress of non-stop wind fighting.

Found some awesome Bridgestone tires... 185R14 size in 8 ply designed
specifically for VW's!  The Medford Firestone/Bridgestone dealer had 4 in
stock... they were $77 bucks (not even on sale) and the shop was great...
they did free balancing of my other two tires (brand new passengers that I
got with another bus... they were fine for front).  Putting the rear tires
up to 50 PSI made a big difference (the Bridgestones are rated up to 65
PSI... but I didn't have my westy loaded that heavy).

But even with great tires, 40 MPH + winds in the Mojave will kick your Type2
butt!  Tires make a great difference, but a box shaped VW is a box shaped
VW.

I will be here all month... even for Christmas!  Come visit and help clean
up after the fire at Ronnie's garage.  http://www.type2parts_dot_com/
