Hi,

Most likely culprit is the link pins.  If they have been left ungreased
 the bearings within can become *very* rusty and sieze.  Probable effect
of disassembly is destruction of a brown rusted mass meaning that your 
bus will be off the road until you get replacements.  But a replacement
link pin kit for  a post 64 buses are cheap at around US$50?

Many places/books advise that you note how the 8 shims (per link pin) were
arranged (at each end) and replace the same way.  This is not technically
correct and
the shims should be arranged so that you get the correct offset on
the torsion arms (offset is around 8.XXmm - I never have my books here
at work).  The shim stack is actually how you sorta do set your camber
on the front end of a bus...........

&gt;  I have a '66 Westy and after changing the shocks I realized that the 
&gt;  front axle was seized on the drivers side. I havn't taken it to the shop 
&gt;  yet to diagnose, but I have been told king pins (link pins)

&gt; Hi Bob,
&gt; The good news is that you can dissassemble and clean one side of your
&gt; front
&gt; suspension in one day easily.  The problem is that most likely you are
&gt; going
&gt; to have to make a list of parts that will have to be replaced while you
&gt; have
&gt; it apart.  Regrease everything and reassemble it if you need your bus to
&gt; drive
&gt; for the next week or month while you get the new parts in.  &lt;snip&gt;
