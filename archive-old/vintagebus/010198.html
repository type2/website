&gt;I have a front bumper from a 67 for sale . is in great shape and has good
&gt;over riders.
&gt;how bout $100  , located in Franklin NC
&gt;sorry cant ship it
&gt;--------Bryan


By chance is it chrome?  I REALLY need a chrome overrider(but a whole bumper
would work).....I'm hoping I don't have to get a painted one chromed.....
