Please pardon my lack of HTML saavy. I'm no Thom. But
maybe I'll make up with my shutter buggin'.

Here are some links to OCTO pics.

I even tried to put a few comments on the images.

I thought I took more, then I loaded the disc and this

BONUS: I don't know if this was the Eddie contingent
in the Haus, but I snapped a few rare busmullet pics

Apologies in advance if any of you guys have the ape
drape (aka the &quot;7&quot;, the Milwaukee neckwarmer, the
Billy Ray, the &quot;Business in the front, Party in the
back&quot; etc. etc.)
