All this talk of cab dividers has got me riled up.  Does anyone have any

pictures and/or specifications to make one?  Or someone in the Phoenix with

one I could trace?   I hate to try and squeeze a piece of ill-fitting

cardboard up in there at an attempt for a pattern.



Also, someone mentioned some felt strips or something at the top to cut down

on vibrations, could you expound on this?



How do they mount at the bottom/top?
-  - - -
I don't have one or a pattern, but they riginally came with a strip of
material on the top edge where it touches the roof metal and a rubbery wedge
at each upper 'corner'.   There were two reinforcements, mounted vertically,
one each side of the window, identical to the the metal slats on the rear over
the engine hump on a barndoor, as far as I can tell w/o checking the part
number.   You can take parts off your barndoor to make a divider!!!!

mounts to the metal cab partition with those 10mm head bolts- if you look on a
panel partition it has threaded inserts for mounting the divider, while other
models don't (unless I guess if you got a combi ordered with a divider which
may have been possible)

I think there is a channel (haven't looked at a panel recently) it slips into
up at the top.  This may be misinformation.
