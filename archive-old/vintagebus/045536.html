Subject: Re: [VB] City on my butt!

 Ever since my neighbor has been in a position where he
couldn't place phone calls to the police, I haven't had any more complaints
phoned in or any police stop by.

................
ya- that is exactly it- they show up in response to complaints.  I (or 
visiting friends ) have had a couple &quot; abandoned vehicle tickets&quot; on our 
buses at a place I used to live in, cause there were some annoying neighbors 
who called the cops.  I called the police to ask about these ticket thing, 
but the cops wiould not say who called in, but I know who it was, and agree 
it was pissant to hide behind the cops like that-  I went away for a weekend 
with some friends (not in my bus), and returned to find an 'abandoned' ticket 
on my bus - jeez-   another time a friend came over, then we went somewhere 
in my buis, and came back to my house later that day to find a similar ticket 
on his bus!  

The neighbors calling about this was really just a waste of the polices time. 
 These were functioning, registered, driving buses.    They had not been left 
in the same location for weeks or months- they did get moved- they were 
primary transportation.  They were not shiney restored, and evidently were 
not up to the neighbors tastes- but this ticketing was completely BS.  These 
were not abandoned vehicles- it was neighbor harrassment hiding behind the 
police.  

There were no fines- it was the 'abandoned ticket&quot; and the cops return in a 
few days and see if the vehicle is gone or is at least 6 miles were added on 
the odometer.
