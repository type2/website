Well, I finally came upon a pretty clean Splitty in Vermont of all places 
(rest assured--this bus hasn't lived on the east coast for long). I'm not 
picking the bus up until the 20th, so I don't have the M codes yet. VIN is 
236159293. Pictures of the bus are at 
http://albums.photopoint_dot_com/j/AlbumIndex?u=970883&amp;a=9359036

She's a Sundial conversion, at least that's what the little metal plate says. 
Anybody know what's supposed to be inside? This one just has a bed and closet 
to hang clothes. And wow, what a shade of paneling. Do I *have* to keep ot 
stock? :~) BTW, instead of a headliner there is the same paneling up top. Is 
this the way Sundial's came or is this someone's elaboration on the theme?

Oh--one last thing--anybody know where I can get a rear view mirror. I'm 
driving her next Friday and would like a mirror in place! (Bracket is there, 
it's the mirror glass that's gone.)

I'm thrilled with this bus. I'll be posting more as I start exploring and 
tinkering.

congrats on the new bus  :)  

your VIN starts with 236, meaning 2 for type2 (bus), 3 for model kombis, and 
6 for 66 model year.  Kombis are  basic, like a panel van with windows, and 
pretty bare in the back, just grey paint with no panels and a back seat 
(middle seat optional for extra DM).  A lot got made into campers.  Westfalia 
used kombis to turn into campers.  (but westy combis got special treatment of 
paint in the cargo area and white steering wheel etc,  anyone know what the M 
code for that is if any? JC) SO did sundial  and other American companies 
(who also used panels, and cut some windows in).  and they put the paneling 
(included roof panelling) and camper kit in.  Is you panel colour extreme?  I 
thought they wre just a regular sort of finished wood.  nicer than the westy 
formica to look at anyway.
