Subject: RE: [VB] Electric fuel pump

I have on occassions run out of &quot;Universal&quot; cases and have had to use &quot;FI&quot;
cases. I just use the 3 1/2 psi electric pump that mounts where the
mechanical should. On mechanical pump cases you can use the same electric
pump with a block off plate. This combo is sold in lots of VW parts ads in
the mags.

Subject: [VB] Electric fuel pump


I was thinking about using an electric fuel pump in my bus.  I think Cal
Grant had one in his '67 mounted to the left of the engine.  Anyone else
mounted an electric pump in the engine compartment?  Or anywhere else?
