&gt;Not to be too picky but you also left out financing cost.

True.  That analysis just looked at base price and fuel cost.  If you 
really want to add up the complete and total cost to you, everybody
else, and the planet, you have to start with digging the iron ore for
the steel, dredging the sand for the glass, growing and lumbering the
rare South American wheel-bearing tree, etc, and go right through to
when the car is finally scrapped for recoverable materials.

&gt;Also, insurance is going to be higher on a new car and I'm guessing 
&gt;the average Joe doesn't have a diagnostic computer to work on either
&gt;of these critters so figure in the higher repair costs as well.  

The repair costs are higher but you don't have them as often.  Compared
to a new car, a Bus needs *lots* of maintenance, but it's a lot of very
simple things.  Newer cars need much less regular maintenance but when
something breaks, replacing it is either more involved, or you have to
replace a whole assembly instead of just the broken part of it.

For most of the computer-controlled cars from the 1980s through to 1995,
you don't even need a computer to get the trouble codes.  Usually you
could jumper a couple of pins on a connector and get the codes flashed
at you on the &quot;check engine&quot; light or read them with a $10 voltmeter.
With the advent of the OBD-II compliant computers in 1995-1996, some
manufacturers dropped this simple method of code retrieval and some
didn't.  A &quot;real&quot; professional OBD-II scan tool will run you about $500,
but you can get an interface that lets you use your existing PC for
about $100.  People complained when they had to buy tach-dwell meters
and strobe timing lights instead of filing points and tuning by ear;
now those two tools are cheap and standard.

Even with the computers, you still have to understand troubleshooting.
My mom's '89 Olds once lit the MIL and set a trouble code for the
camshaft position sensor.  I read the code with a paper clip, but
before changing out the sensor, I checked over the harness with an
ohm-meter to make sure it wasn't just a broken wire.  When one of
the ignition coils on the distributorless ignition on my '89 Chevy
went out, I got no MIL even after 40 miles of highway driving.  I
knew something was wrong because I had to floor it to do 60 and it
seemed to be using a lot of gas.  Pulling all the plugs revealed
two that weren't firing; tracing the plug wires showed these to
be on the same coil; rigging up a 12 volt test light to the coil
terminals proved that the module was not firing that coil.  When
the computer on that same Chevy failed after 100,000 miles, I got
no MIL and had to troubleshoot it using the factory procedure.  When
I was sure it was faulty, a rebuilt replacement was $100 exchange at
AutoZone, comparable to what a new 34-PICT-3 will run you.

I know I babble a lot about this but it's one of my pet subjects.
If you can read a manual and follow directions, there isn't much
difference between working on a 1951 Bus and a 2001 Eurovan, IMHO.

Since it's way past Friday and there is less Bus content in this
thread all the time, I'll shut up on the list now.  :)
