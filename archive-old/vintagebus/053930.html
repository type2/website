Subject: [VB] theft deterrent (was DC stolen...) 

From: Jason Elm &lt;jelm2_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt; 
While we're all on the subject of car security...
I had a 66 bug in high school, I installed a 60-amp
non-fused pull-out switch in it under the back seat.
------------------
I mention the splitty bus replacement '92 F150 half the time to create flame
bait. This time I'll mention it to say that there is a factory installed theft
prevention device under the dash. Shaped like the handle of an Afro comb, a
piece plugs into a female socket. Remove it or bump with your knee and you will
not be able to start the vehicle. Dont know how many times that I've bumped it
slightly and was momentarily stumped as to why the POS wouldnt start. Readjust
the Afro switch and I'm on my way. Maybe there is a chance that one of these
&quot;helpful&quot; hummers could be fitted into the splitties. They would be stealth as
heck under the dash/above the pkg tray...
