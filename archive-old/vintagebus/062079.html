Subject: RE: [VB] Air backpressure

&gt;Need to balance it too.  Berg does both to the fans they sell that have
been welded.

Steve&lt;

I have always wondered about this... Sure you can have a balanced fan, but
it is worthless unless the pulley and generator is balanced with it.  Just
having the fan balanced is like dynamically balancing a crank without the
flywheel.

Actually I was planning on taking the whole fan/gen/pulley assembly to Jake
Raby to try and balance it anyway :)  I say try because I have not heard of
anyone doing this before...


Take Care,
