&gt;Also, my 67 doesn't use the nylon bushing under the shifter thingee,
&gt;so I just need to get the sprung pin thru the slot, then jam down on
&gt;the shifter, and insert a bolt loosely.

Right.  You have the pin that is fixed to the body and that goes into
the end of the shift rod.  With that pin, your shift rod can't pitch,
yaw, side-to-side, or up-and-down.  It can only roll and move fore-and-aft.
With the earlier design, the shift rod can pitch, yaw, roll, fore-and-aft,
aside-to-side, and up-and-down.  Six degrees of freedom versus two...

&gt;BE SURE to use anti-sieze grease

Does it have to be anti-sieze or will plain old grease work?  I have
both; just curious.

&gt;Did you know that the Craftsman flat 17/19mm ratcheting wrench (using
&gt;the 17mm side) makes getting those two top-of-engine mounting bolts
&gt;off and on a real cinch when you're taking out/installing your engine?

I don't think I had them the last time I pulled an engine but yes, they
would help.  There seem to be plenty of nuts on a VW that are designed
for a wrench - the clearances aren't enough to get a socket+ratchet
over the nut head.  The back bolt on the carb and the fuel pump are
two good examples.  They're also good for non-Bus applications where
you have a bolt too long to use a deep socket on but you still want
the ratchet action.   I have a set of 5 inch and 5 metric of these and
I use them a lot.
