Subject: RE: [VB] Need for speed - limit

... George said ...

Y'know, I have a stock bus which I drive at about 58MPH.  I don't feel
terribly unsafe on freeways and I really don't care if some random trucker
gets upset at having to change lanes to pass me.  They need _something_ to
gripe about or they won't have anything with whichto cuss at each other
over the CB.

I prefer the side roads, but I'm not going to stop using the freeways
because I don't run the speed limit.  The speed limit is a maximum, not
the only speed you can run.


George you are right about the speed limit BUT ...
If I got on the interstates around here where anything under 65MPH is
dangerous, I would be roadkill in the first 5 miles.  It disgusts the hell
out of me when I wind up driving an extra 20% or so (distance-wise) on the
side roads when I am in a 'hurry' to get from point A to point B.
Fortunately, I usually drive for the pleaseure of driving; and the side
roads do in fact make it more fun.
