Subject: [VB] Tranny work and lube question
Message-ID: &lt;20000101042448.77924.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Dad and I removed the transaxle this afternoon and I am preparing to 
disassemble it tomarrow and fix the fourth gear problem.  I have seen the 
recent posts on GL 5 gear lube.  What is a GL rating? Is the fluid of the 
transmission, differential and redux boxes all common fluid or are these 
separate supplies of fluid? What fluid should I put into the boxes and the 
tranny? Bear with me I'm new at all of this... I also want to add how much 
I've learned from this list in the last two weeks and how helpful it has 
been this far. Thank you all for your advice and time. God Bless and Happy 
New Year.

Scott
