Hmmm.....
That was probably the beginning of the Orange county thefts.....
Ive heard that same story more than twice over the last two years.....
Did anyone hear if they recovered the 58 okrasa beetle from lennys shop that 
was stolen a week ago?

&lt;&lt;I received confirmation that this Bus on my site:

http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/photos/standards/bus1.jpg

was stolen approx. 2 years ago.  Owner is from the Bay Area, Bus was stolen 
in L.A..  Yeah, it's a long time ago, but you never know.  Here's the 
description:

Restored '67 Deluxe 21-window - Green/white
Please contact Raul at DJRatedRSJ_at_aol_dot_com (not the owner) if you have any 
info.  It has a distinctive tan-colored pinstripe along the beltline.

Story was the owner was visiting Disneyland down in L.A., he used it quite a 
bit for a day or 2, someone apparently followed him from the grocery store to 
his mom's house, he stopped to pick something up inside and within a few 
minutes, it was gone.

It was the first Bus picture I scanned to put on my site!  

Thanks.
