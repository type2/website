Subject: Re: Dual Carbs need Help

        I have a new set of dual 40 Weber carbs and I am in need of help. I
have been trying to tune these dam things for a couple of weeks off and on
with no luck. The passenger side is pulling more air and than the driver
side and the fuel mixture screws don't seem to change the effect on them
when adjusted except speed the idle up and down depending on adjustment. The
Idle screws are two turns out on the lower linkage connection. I have
checked for leaks with the ole carb spray and no change as well. I also have
a weber carb manual but it is not much help just give the set fuel mixture
screws two turns out and start from there. So this is either very easy
process or I have one of these thing out of the box messed up. I have a
syncrometer to adjust the carbs and they are disconnected from the linkage
when the engine warms up it speeds up and slows down. Which the manual say
is either to a vacume leak or unadjusted carbs. Since is a brand new engine
with only idle time on it. I haven't check the valves yet and the shop sets
the default gap there so I am stumped any help is appreciated.


Please Help,
