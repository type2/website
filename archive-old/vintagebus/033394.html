I have a 63 standard bus and want to lower it.
Can anyone tell me where i can get info on this job.
Stock rear end but front beam is a early model bay window ball joint
unit. Any ideas would be appreciated
- - - - --

first of all....   WHY do you want to lower it?   what do you want out of it?

Other than prefering the stock height for looks, I prefer it for
functionality.    I use my bus to haul stuff.   If you pile a lot of weight
in/on the roof rack of  a lowered bus, the wheels rub.    This has
inrritating noises, smells bad, and can prematurely wear out tires.    A bus
is a work vehicle, it seems to me, at least I tend to work them.   

but-  to do it...


Front-

 you can do it the wrong way, which is taking out some torsion leafs springs.
Do NOT do this!!!!!   It will ride like sh*t, and is unsafe.  It is taking out
the strength of the suspension, and is a really bad idea.    It is cheap, but
DO NOT do it.  It is dangerous.   

You can buy drop spindles or an adjustable front beam.  Wolfgang International
in Redding, Ca.  sells them.    You keep the strength of the suspension, but
the spindles will come out at a different, lower, angle.   
BTW, a ball joint front end rides higher than the king pin front end.

or you can get smaller tires to put on the bus.  Low profile tires on 14&quot; rims
will bolt right on


Back--

you can lower it by turning the spring plates,  (cheapest version)

you can lower it by switching away from reduction gear boxes (using 68 bug
axles or swing axle type 3 axles, and flipping the ring gear),  this makes the
bus higher geared.

or doing the small tire thing.
