Andre- funny you should mention that 8^) ...
the type 1 cooler is 2.5&quot; thick and has six rows of fins.
the type 4 cooler is 3.25 &quot; thick and has eight rows of fins.
i don't have a type 3 cooler handy to measure...
the type 4 cooler is the way to go, but you will have to fabricate
an extended doghouse to do it ( extend the extra  3/4&quot;  to the FIF ).

&gt;My question is this: were there &quot;heavy duty&quot; oil coolers available? I just
&gt;got an oil cooler that I bought on eBarf and it fits perfect on the mount
&gt;and the holes line up perfect but two of the bolts are simply too short!!!
&gt;Original cooler as I remember was a bit thinner. This baby is like 3.25&quot;
&gt;thick, 3.25&quot; wide and about 10&quot; long. Does that sound right?
&gt;
&gt;Help me here solve this puzzle.
