Check the site.  I just finished adding a image upload to the VW Auto sales
section.  This feature has been lacking, and I am sure turned allot of
people off to the site.  It is there now...Enjoy.

When submitting an ad, there is something to be aware of when referring to
the image.  On the general ad submittal, in the &lt;image name&gt; field, the
image name should include any extensions.  (i.e....jpg, .GIF, .bmp).  And of
course the name you submit, must correspond to the file you upload.

Thanks for making this site what it is!
