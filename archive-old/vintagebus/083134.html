Subject: More on balancing....

OK......Hit the %$## send button by mistake........

....This in a small city of 700,000, if you were wondering. My regular
mechanic had a go at this as well in phoning around with no luck. So I will
use the front drum off an early '60s bus as the adapter and see if that
works.

The tire shop that restored my rims and balanced the tires before just did
this 1.5 yrs/6000 miles ago tried.......... 2 out of 3 rims are now &quot;bent&quot;
according to them ......and I beg to differ

So hopefully this drum &quot;adapter&quot; will work out....
