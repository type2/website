&gt; if you look at the vintage bus archives about the supposed danger of
&gt; using plastic filters, you'll find a whole mess of folks with
&gt; similar (non-)experiences.  consensus, as i remember, is that glass
&gt; filters are a waste of money.

There is one thing I would point on the plastic vs glass. The glass
style I use has actual hose barb ends. While I'm not worried about the
plastic ones breaking, I always get a bit fussy when I have to use
connectors for fuel that do not have an intergral barb flair. But I
suspect EVERYONE would at least say, use something.
