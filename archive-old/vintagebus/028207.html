Subject: Parts Book Needed for E-Project

Folks,

I've got some extra capacity in my print shop this summer (too many
school kids that want extra hours) and I was thinking of re-visiting my
parts book project. Seven years ago I used a '63 Bus parts book to
recreate a batch of all color books. I gave them to friends as Christmas
presents, and sold off the rest at a Bulli Brigade show for cost. 

Well, now I'm going to do it again, but this time in PDF format. It will
be more time intensive, but I will be able to duplicate it for the price
of a CD ($1) and stick it on my web site. I've heard of others doing
this, and it was even brandied about on the list a couple years ago. But
progress seems to be slow, so I'm going to put my employees to work. My
goal it to create a text searchable, and heavily bookmarked/hyperlinked
document that works for all buses through 1967.

What I need, is an original parts book with updates through 1967. I'll
purchase it, borrow it, rent it, or whatever....let me know what I can get.

Have Fun,
Jason McDaniel
Houston, Texas
