I can do this one, as I did all this to *my* Titian Red and Beige Grey 67
walk-thru deluxe too.

&gt; PO also removed the rubber material at the base of the

&gt; Also, what is supposed to be on the floor between the seats? 
&gt; Any suggestions? 

Okay, the back panels to the front seats are flat, they do not wrap
around, as it may appear. they just covered the backs as you can see on
the photos at Pete's Page, 4th shot down.

The material which wraps around the bottoms of the seat bases is a
linear-grooved neoprene floor covering obtained from McMaster Carr
catalog, and can easily be cut to fit the shapes required (I had no
problem, just do it sensibly and orderly. The material will help you by
being able to be stuffed into the aluminum rail which wraps around the
seat base - if that's gone, then hmmmmm....

The material between the seats on the walk-thru floor, is a diamond
patterned neoprene floor covering, also 1/8 inch thick as the above other
covering, and is held down by two sheet steel angles with holes for three
screws each, one at the front of the piece, and one at the rear. You can
see the rear one on that photo as well. You do have those pieces I hope.
Otherwise more junk yard visits or machine shop sheet metal bending
exercises. 

I would have to look up the stock numbers for the rubber sheets, but if
the company you work for has an account with McMaster Carr, you should be
able to find a catalog or beg them to send you one. If you need more info,
I can look it up - It's somewhere here, but will take a bit of time. 

Both sheet materials are 1/8 inch thick and the side sheets are v-ribbed
horizontally along their length, and the center sheet on the floor is
diamond patterned embossed, the diamonds are about 3/16 square and repeat
all over the sheet. By diamonds, I mean that they are four-way facetted
shallow pyramids stamped into the rubber for anti-slip applications. 
The V-ribbings are about 1/8 inch across each rib and about 3/32 inch
deep.

You may be able to get these items at a jobber house which does industrial
floor coverings. These materials are used to cover patches of areas which
need to be slip-proofed for safety, such as metal stairs leading up to
scaffolds, elevated exposed walkways, etc.

If you need any more data, I will look up specifics. Pmail me.
