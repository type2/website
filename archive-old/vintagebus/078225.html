Diane,

Once the bad bolt is removed, all four bolts will have to be retorqued in
the correct order and to the correct torque. Be sure to get the correct
hardness rating on that replacement bolt. You'll need a torque wrench, or
you'd better stick around and watch the mechanic torque those bolts, and
do it in the correct order. And the brake line bracket has to go back
under the lockplate for the upper bolt on each side as well. And you
should have lock plates installed to lock down the four bolts.

Lots of details to get this right.
