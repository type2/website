Subject: window rubber?

Asking for recommendations, on where to get the best.... [Yea I know it's a 
relative term.] side window rubber for my double cab.
Want the one for the hole, not the frame.

While taking out the old rubber, I noticed a fair amount of silicon applied 
by the PO
No sign of rust, but this truck came from E. Oregon, very little precipe in 
this region.
&amp; since acquiring it, it's always garaged, earlier thread, spoke of roofing 
tar as a preventive method when installing windows? 

I have used ....WBW.... &amp; have grown accustomed to there above average 
service&amp; good products.

As I said, any other thoughts on this subject?
