&lt;&lt; a friend of mine has a 67 b*g transmission in his bus, recently a rear axle
 seal went out and he lost about a qt and a half of gear oil, with that all
 being fixed now the only way to stay in 4th is to hold it in gear , it
 doesnt take much to hold it but still not right heh anyone have this type of
 problem before ? any ideas ?
  &gt;&gt;

yes, running low on tranny oil can damage your trans.   While a bungee cord 
is a useful temporary device to hold it in 4th, time to think about a rebuild 
trans.   With a  bus 4th gear.
