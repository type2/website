Let's start with the obvious. 1967 model year was the start of twelve volts
and the end of German split screen production so there are some electrical
items to put on the list.  Keep in mind that some items must have been
available to earlier 12v option buses. Items with an asterisk are without a
doubt OYO parts. Items with two asterisks are OYO but no big deal.

Starter
Wiper Motor*
Gas Guage
Fuel Sender
Radio Block-Off Plate*
9 pin 12 volt flasher/emgency relay*

In conjunction with the 12v conversion there are some parts that may be
found on earlier factory 12v conversion buese but are are found on all 67s.

Tranny:ground out for bell for 12v flywheel, gearing is different than all
previous trannies, and maybe that nosecone with the hole for the back up
light switch. It seems 67s got the back up lights somtime begging on Oct 66
which is  a month or two into  67 model year production.

12  volt flywheel,
Various bulbs
Cutoff solenoid for carb? Prolly any 12v Solex part will do as long as it
fits.

Gettin back to OYO parts

Brake Master Cylinder. 1967 model was first year of production for daul
cirut brakes. This I think was done to keep the buese &quot;one tonne&quot; rating,
(There are some early 1967 model year buses that are single circut brakes)
This has been a pricey part but I just bought one from type2parts_dot_com for
$150. Call Ronnie and he wil hook you up. *

Seat beal anchoring points. The was becoming mandatory for all cars sold in
the US although seatbelts were not standard in the rear bus optional at
least in my bus. When I got it it still had all the black plastic caps in
the mounting holes and the cargo floor mat had perfed cutouts in it for the
seat belts to come through but had never been punched out.



Middle Seat has 1967 only spacing on the legs and the side kick panel is OYO
from what I have been told.*

Gas tank has a little hump on top but functionally it appears the same as
all split tanks**

There are crafty ways to get around many of these OYO issues as I have
learned from the list. Check the archives for specifics.

The above list is prolly not complete or accurate but it was more fun to
type this up that start painting the cloest:)
