Saw a clever setup a while ago. The guy turned a set of adapters that lock
to the original spindles with grub screws. These things had the same profile
as the later beetle, and maybe bus?, spindles that take the 'modern' type of
wiper blades. Worked very well and I would suspect that the wiping action
would be more positive due to the extra leverage that the later design has.

I liked it cos returning to stock would take about a minute maybe two.

One could prolly make a set up with a file, a hand drill, a tap and a bit of
time.

Later
