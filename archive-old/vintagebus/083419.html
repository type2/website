Subject: Re: [VB] re:overheating

A search on the Samba gallery will pull up plenty of &quot;off roading&quot; pics with
my old bus. Yes, the engine bay got really dirty, but no more than the other
guys that were on those cruises with me with thier &quot;normal&quot; engine tin.

I may drive a box, but I try to think outside of it. Anything can be
improved upon. ;-)

&gt; Take cooling air from _under_ the bus?  Perhaps, if you only drive on
&gt; smooth paved roads, but what bus will _never_ find a bit of dirt or
&gt; gravel now and then?  There's an excellent reason why the vents are up on
&gt; the side of the vehicle!
&gt;
&gt; I've had my engine bay get filthy from the dust that made its way past
&gt; fresh engine seals.  I'd hate to imagine what it would be like if I gave
&gt; it free entry via the front engine tin!  With that cooling fan, the
&gt; engine bay is like a vacuum cleaner, and your engine also has to
&gt; _breathe_ that air (you, too, if the heater is on!)
