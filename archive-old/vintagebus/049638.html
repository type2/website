Subject: Re: [VB] VB Bus driving music

 Before Thom kills the thread I must put in a vote for The
&gt;Minutemen,&quot;Double Nickels on the Dime&quot; all four sides on one tape. Even
&gt;George Hurley drove a bus when they were making the recored :)


AND he even put the motor running on the record!
Listen and see if George tuned it properly, or if it has any exhaust leaks :)
