&lt;&lt;No, they're flat steel. We'll have to pull them off and look closer for 
marks.&gt;&gt;
Hi Harry,
Well they sure look like ZVW 163 403 (Left) or ZVW 163 404 (Right).  Someone 
on the list found what is most likely the same USA manufacture of diamond 
plate side step for under the cargo doors that mountds in the jack points and 
this step had the manufature name and location on it!  We have the front and 
rear bumpers for our SC made from steel diamond plate, again probably the 
same manufacture.  We are looking for one or two of these diamond plate under 
cago steps for our 1963 SC.
