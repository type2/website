about spacing, on yourpage where you show what the mtag should look like, to
review , it puts the space between the model number and the 4th number on
that line, in my case it says
UP251 2121872
where it should be
UP2512 121872

also by your translation  the top should be blue and the bottom white,
claralw_at_aol_dot_com says the same, but the top is white and the bottom
blue,whats up with that?

also the birthday is march 7 of 65 or 66??



thanks again, jb


&gt; If you go to http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/registry you can enter these into
&gt; a form, which will then return the decodes for you.  I'm at work right
now,
&gt; and they block my site(!), otherwise I'd enter them.
&gt;
&gt; The 07 3 is the date in european format (7th of March)
&gt;
&gt; THe second line is your mcodes; I don't have those memorized
&gt;
&gt; UP is the export code, ie where it came into the US (portland?)
&gt; 2512 is the model code and paint code
&gt; 121872 is your color 12 is the top, 18 is the bottom, 72 is the interior
&gt; 6115484 is your chassis #
&gt;
&gt; Go enter them in the registry, and you'll get more info.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Go out and take another look - you have some of the spacing wrong, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; that's important!
&gt; &gt; sorry i must have spaced out
&gt; &gt; ok heres my corrected
&gt; &gt; m codes, can someone do the translation for me please:
&gt; &gt; 07 3
&gt; &gt; 425 002 081 114 130
