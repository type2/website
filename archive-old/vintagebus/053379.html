Subject: the latest on the Italian transporter

okay, I found a VW mechanic and a local bus-nut just
minutes after posting my question to you all (strange
how that happens, even through total language blocks
and no outward signs...they were together and just
whipped out a stack of photos in the corner
pub....huh? says I.) Anyway, I understood enough to
realize they were willing to help and we'll go to the
local authorities again tomorrow and see what happens
with additional taxes, registration, etc. It should be
interesting. If anyone's got anything further, I'm
listening. Thanks to those who lent their advice and
know-how today...it was great help and hopefully I'll
be able to pull this off.....and I'll let you know.
Incidentally, there is a bus rally in Rome this
weekend. I am trying to sneak a ride with the mechanic
in his '57 deluxe transporter...all original,
including the plates!! I'll try to get some pics to
post.
