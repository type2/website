 Regardless the tube definatly has rust on the inside. I'm wondering what 
 I'm gonna do to clean it out. What to do to prevent the rusty inside of the 
 tube from getting worse. At this point the tube appears to be very much 
 intact. I'd like to keep it that way.

paul_f_at_ntlworld_dot_com (Paul) 's idea of the clutch cable on a drill sound great 
for scarping of old rust inside the tube

oil is a good rust inhibitor.   
though that doesn't make the inside of the tube smooth.
