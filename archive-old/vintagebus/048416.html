Believe me Thom I am as surprised at you that my bus is worth that much. In
this market today and seeing what people are buying for this much, this is
a bargain. I may have sold it short. The mechanicals are done. It has all
new brakes, shocks, newer engine (with new generator,carb etc...). It is a
reliable driver with everything working well. It is a nice looking van like
it is. I took it to a combination Porsche / VW show early this summer and
it was cool to have the Porsche guys, who usually don't even glance at the
VW's, drooling. I agree with you once again on the trailer lights. In
relation to other trailer lights these are really clean, simply a nice
round black bezel, they are cut in how ever (sorry Jack). They are cut
around exactly where the originals were and will not be hard to weld up. I
have the originals. Jack nailed it, I drive this bus all over, the trailer
lights are all ready there and are really bright and who is going to steal
a pair of Wal-Mart trailer lights. If they do it is 30 minutes to go get
another $7.50 set and slap them in. The originals took me two years and I
am embarrassed to say how much to get. I never thought I would sell this
and I honestly get queasy thinking about it. It simply solves a lot of
problems for me right now and I still am left with my 60 Double Cab (which
as twisted as it seems I love more than the Deluxe). I really appreciate
the notes in defense of the myself and the bus and I do not take any
offense in your comments, Thom. Thanks for dealing with this awesome list.

ps - Thanks to Douglas at Transrest_at_aol_dot_com I can post again. It is in a
round about manner. I have to do personal e-mail to vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com.
It is quite annoying but it has been a long time sitting and biting my
tongue because I could not get through. I still don't know what the problem
is with this e-groups list. I have unsubbed and resebbed about 6 times. My
other e-groups list I am on is not a problem it works great.
