Subject: trade my bus for your labor OREGON
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com, type2_at_type2_dot_com

hey its almost friday.
I am looking for folks in the eugene/springfield Oregon area to work on my 
house in exchange for vw stuff. I would prefer folks who do it for a living 
and can provide references, and photos where finish work is involved. I need 
plumbing, dry wall, tile, siding, and maybe later a big ol slab of concrete 
or some black top. have buses and parts. mostly 67 and earlier. If interested 
please p-mail.
thanks
ronnie
