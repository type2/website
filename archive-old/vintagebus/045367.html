&lt;&lt; I'm getting ready to do my first engine build, and was wondering if 
someone could throw me a list of tools I'm going to need. &gt;&gt;
Hi Aaron,
Not know you and how many engines you plan to do here below is a complete 
listing that we can think of.  You can do without alot of these if you have a 
shop do some of the specialized work for you.
Hydralic press
Ring compressor
Tool to install flywheel seal
Spring retainers to hold tappets in place while you put the case halfs 
together.
Engine case boring bar
Head rebuild tools and fixtures.
 0-6&quot; dial caliper.
Dial indicator.
Torque wrench.
Adjustable pushrod to figure the length of push rods needed for proper 
rocker/valve stem geometery.
Pexiglass fixture and a way to measure liquid ccs to cc the head chambers.
Flywheel lock.
Crankshaft pulley puller.
Balance beam, or scale.
Hope that helps, Eric&amp;Barb
