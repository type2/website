Subject: Hard to put into gear

Well, took off the forward shift rod to fix the front bushing.
Practically fell over in hysterics when the coupler just slipped right
apart.  No effort needed.  I was expecting the battle royal with torch,
wax, and all the big guns of battle.  I must of done something right
recently.

Put the new forward bushing in and greased and reinstalled the shifter.
Much better, but still not the source of my main problem with the
shifter.  The problem is tough notch shifting (especially 1st) and an
inability to get it into reverse while the motor is running (grinding).
To reverse I have to start it in reverse.

The clutch peddle has the proper amount play, but the clutch seems to be
not fully disengaging.  There is plenty of thread left on the cable to
adjust more, but then there is no free play left at the pedal.  Could
the cable be stretched??  I've adjusted many a clutch cable but this one
has me stumped.

Thanks!

Steve
