Hi James,
There are LT radial tires that are so whimpy that some of the P tires are 
stronger.  It seems to be wieght rating (About 1525 per tire for bus.) is a 
better way to look for tires.  We have found Trailfinder radials (Michilian? 
SP?) to have a 1595 Lbs. wieght rating for $39.00 at Discount Tire Co. Inc. 
was the only one in the 205/75R15 size to surpass the original bias tire 
wieght rating.  We bought two and so far on the front wheels they have a good 
feel driving on the freeway, even in windy weather.    Eric&amp;Barb
