Hi Joel,
That is the early linkage for non-doghouse fresh air fan shrouds.  VW 
replaced this linkage with a long linkage with only one hole in each end that 
connected two mini linkages that were mounted on each of the flaps.  This 
combo of long linkage and mini links pushed the long linkage to the front to 
clear the front side of the doghouse cooler base/mount.
  About four months ago we helped a friend with his 71 Ghia and found that 
his engine had a totally differant doghouse linkage!  There are no mini links 
just one long one with enough offset to clear the cooler base/mount and the 
two holes in each end for the four shafts on the flaps.

&lt;&lt;  I am thinking if I made a new one with a greater offset (maybe 1 1/4&quot;?) 
it would clear the fan shroud. But what was VW's solution?&gt;&gt;
  The new doghouse linkage we have has a 1.40&quot; offset.

&lt;&lt;  So if my horizontal rod is wrong, is my vertical rod likely to be wrong 
too? How long is the correct one, and where is it bent? &gt;&gt;

The verticle rod for fresh air thermostat system is listed in our pre-1968 
bus parts manual as 211 199 163 A  Connecting rod from Engine No. 627 578.  
This same part is listed in our late 70s type 1 parts manual with the 
doghouse system!
