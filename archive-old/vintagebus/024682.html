Or maybe we should be the ones recognizing... recognizing the fact that
it was a subtle troll on Thom's part :)  &lt;not like he has a sense of
humor or anything... :) &gt; 
	Why am I visualizing militant Deadheads strolling through the
countryside, one hand locked in a permanent peace sign and the other
gripping a worn copy of DeadBase VII...? they're liable to come knocking
any minute now to tell me how screwed up the setlists on my bootlegs are
and what songs they're missing. yikes... 
	not to draw anyone out of the woodwork or anything, but I'm going to go
make sure that the door is locked ;)
