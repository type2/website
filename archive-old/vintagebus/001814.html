Subject: clutch problems - what did i do wrong!
Date: Sun, 1 Oct 2000 21:06:20 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

So I pulled my engine and transaxle and put everything back together with a
new clutch cable.  I thought that the clutch pedal went down way, way, way
to easy but I couldn't see what I did wrong.  The SO stepped on the pedal
while I was underneath and the lever on the side of the transmission case
seem to move through its whole range of motion and I really don't know much
at all about things mechanical ..... so I figured .... it must be OK.  I got
the shift rod all back together and it seems ok.  So I finally got my bus to
start I was very anxious to see how it would run - new bearings in the
reduction boxes, new shocks all around .... blah, blah, blah ,,,, anyway, I
thought I'd go for a drive and .. stepped on the clutch - which went down
way, way, way to easy and my bus went into reverse and stalled! NO Clutch -
Clearly I've screwed up my clutch some how .... but how?


So I spent about 3 hours today trying to get my bus to start .... while I
was off  getting new plugs and points and condenser my SO was reading Muir -
and at some point he says turn the engine and see of gas comes out of the
fuel pump - it didn't - so she pulled off my fuel pump - instead of looking
to see if gas was getting to the fuel pump to begin with she just pulled it
off - problem was the level of gas in the gas tank was very low -I think -
below the point at which it is necessary to pull the reserve knob - could I
have screwed up the reserve valve - I had it off and replaced the cork -
there are only two settings right - regular and reserve - there is no way to
have it completely off - right?

Thanks In Advance
