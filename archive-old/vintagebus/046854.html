I'm just wondering if anyone can decifer the tag that is behind the 
passenger seat. It reads:
 
21 D
-----
build 21st December
.....
425 002 043
- -  - - -
M-codes- 425 is us specs,  etc.
....
UN 2112 383883 6078245
  - --  - --
UN- port N in the US is where it was shipped to 
2112- model code- panel van 
383883- velvet green above&amp;below the beltline, mesh grey (aka salt and pepper)
upholstery
6xxxxxx - a 66 model year bus, (so was buildt winter solstice 65)  the last 6
digits are specific to this bus - the entire vin would be 216078245- see how
the first 3 digits explain type/model/year
 ....
Below the tag is a sticker that reads:
 
SAMTGRUN  L  512
 
There are two little dots over the U, but I dont know how to make them 
on the computer.
 -- - - -
that's Velvet Green in German and the paint code.  The dots are an umlaut
(makes the U sounds different than a plain U).   Some people write it like
&quot;Samtgru:n&quot;on umlaut deficient computers like mine.
 
I thought the NEATO webpage has a list of M codes and how to decipher the tag.
And didn't Thom FitzP put something similar on his webpage?
