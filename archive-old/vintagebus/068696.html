Subject: Re: [VB] dead bus (won't start)

Did you lap the cylinders into the heads when you installed them? If you did, you have burnt valves.
If not, you could try lapping them and trying again.

OTOH, I would go ahead and do a valve job and ring it while I had it apart. Cheap insurance.

So I checked and re-checked everything. All is good. Rockers assy's are on,
valves are adjusted, plugs are in and firing order is correct, everything else
was as before when running.
I get an idea to do a compression check (a friend also suggested this)
Here's the off the wall readings I get.
#1 85lbs
#2 50lbs.
#3 140lbs (seems high for #3 cylinder)
#4 70lbs.

#1 and 2 plugs are fouled out black and reaking of gas
#3 and 4 plugs are brand new looking.
