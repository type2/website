Hi, 

there is a big red wire that goes to the  fat push on connector at the VR 
mounted in the engine compartement (if someone put one there at one time, which 
usually they have).   There are two big push ons on the VR, take a big red wire 
and put a connector on to fit that other big push on, and run that to the + 
on the Alt.

Now take a double male adaptor, and put it on the blue/green wire that run to 
the VR (remove it from the VR) now make a blue wire that attaches to it and 
runs to the other connector on the alt.

Doing the wiring leaving the connections intact makes it easy if you sometime 
want to use a generator.  Chopping wiring will earn you curses from a next 
owner.

Clara
