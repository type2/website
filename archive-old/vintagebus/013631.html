Next I moved up front to clean the terminals and replace the bulbs in the
fried egg turnsignal lights. These, too, also got new seals behind
them.Removing the headlights revealed the little marker bulb on one side has
had it's wires cut. Thank goodness the passenger side light is still hooked up
so I can trace the wires and see where it goes too. Exactly what are these
little bulbs supposed to do? Are they for daytime running lights?

I believe those are you parking lights, you know when you pull the headlight
switch halfway out.

  I put the headlights back in because the buckets are going to require some
thorough blasting a cleaning. The paint is peeling and surface rust has
settled in. I suppose I could por15 them but would the black paint affect the
lighting? Maybe if anything it would act like a mirror? 

I have a similar problem with my buckets. I am not sure what to do yet, but
POR-15 black is not what to do, the reason they are a bright color is to
reflect the light out, black would only absorb most of the light. Chrome would
probably be best, i think mine are an off white and that is the original
color-anyone oout there no a paint code for this or something?
