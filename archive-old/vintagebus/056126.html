 if I'm not mistaken, some of the new cases come without the ridge, which
 means either glue it and pray or a trip to the machinist

 Van Is

&gt; &gt; That's weird. If you were using the original bottle cap steel cam plug,
it
&gt; &gt; shouldn't have fallen out. It has a fairly large ridge around it that
&gt; &gt; mates with a deep ridge in the case.
