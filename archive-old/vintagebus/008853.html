&gt; Folks,
&gt; I have an import ticket for my bus which stated the chassis number as
&gt; 258459, I'm not sure that this is right, as I can't check it against the
&gt; bus (it's in the shop)
&gt; Looking at Thom's FAQ, this would make it a (25) Sondermodell (Special
&gt; Model, 7-seater)
&gt; Manufactured in 1958 (8), the bus has semaphores, weren't these dropped
for
&gt; '58 ?

i make your chassis number a manufactured in april/earlymay 57 - the model
year being different to the manufacture date started in august 57 (model
year58) yours i think is before that no. so a 57 it is then.
semaphores were dropped for the us a lot earlier than for the uk. - we kept
em up till 60.

you may be confusing the chassis number with the mcode plate... where it- if
you have the info.. will tell you what model it is.

&gt; Also, shouldn't the chassis number be 9 digits ?

8 numbers till 55 -
then 6 numbers till 63
then 9. :)

&gt; Yours, confused,

hth

Glynn (can i take my anorak off now?) ;)
