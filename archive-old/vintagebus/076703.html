Subject: Re: [VB] Rubberized Coatings - an Interior Rust Preventative?

I used a non-petroleum based Henry roof patch goop on the inside of my '63 DC. Uses some kind of clay as the binder and is water soluble until it dries. No solvent smell and it doesn't melt in the 110f heat we have here. Leaking gas has washed some of it off the interior near the filler though. Can't verify the rust repelling ability, but it keeps condensed moisture off the inside of the body and soaks up road and wind noise pretty good.
