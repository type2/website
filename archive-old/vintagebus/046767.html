&lt;&lt; I am thinking mebbee bolting  sturdy bars to both front and back bumper
 mounts, and lifting using those. &gt;&gt;
Not a good idea.  With the whole wieght of the bus on one end they would 
bend.  Especially the rear!  We used a pair of not so nice 1966-67 bug rims 
to make a set of roll over bars for our 1961 bug.  Welded two thick curved 
steel tubes to the rims with straight pipes slipped in the top of the curved 
pipes, and then jacked the bug over on one side.  Have seen photos of this 
done in the 1950s or early 60s.  Worked well on our 1961 bug.  Just remember 
to drain the tranny, fuel tank, steering box, and remove the engine, and 
battery to lighten it.   Eric&amp;Barb
