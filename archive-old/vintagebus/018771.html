I would like to remind everyone to check the condition
of their fire extinguisher, fuel lines and clamps on
all their vehicles today. A few minutes can save your
hard work and possibly yourself from going up in
smoke.

Driving down 101 today thru Hospital Curve a Jeep was
on the side of the road with a engine fire. Don't let
this happen to you!
