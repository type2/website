Personally I think 21 window and 23 window are about the same. I don't think
it's so much about rarity of the bus but more like about the &quot;Ultimate&quot; bus.
Most of the guys, gals have their ultimate bus in mind and I can bet
anything you want that a 23 window sunroof DeLuxe would be at the top of
that list.
Me including.

Later,

Andre


&gt; My experience has always been that the later model busses ('64-'67)
&gt; are much more common than the earlier ones. It doesn't make sense,
&gt; like you said, cause of all the years and restorations and such.
