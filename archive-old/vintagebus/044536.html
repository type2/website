I have been drving the 63 snglecab around for the last few weeks and am very
happy with the gas mileage.
Over 500 miles I am getting 27 miles to the gallon.
I still wonder if the mileometer is right but I now have 165 15's on the frnt
instead of the 135 15's that were there.
I think they may be smaller than the original tyres because when I am doing
60-65 everyone is flying ast me on the freeway.
I know it seems too fast but the engine is nice &amp; cool, I am not using oil,
and I do have 205's on the back.
I must take the tachometer from my 70 westy and temporarily add it to the
singlecan to verify that I am not frying my engine.

What is regular gas mileage???
