Subject: cargo floors or belly pans
Message-ID: &lt;a67c672b.247f7b26_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello folks,

	I am planning on taking apart my 23 window to start the body and 
paint work and I just have a couple of questions. I have a couple of holes 
cut in the floor about 4 inches from the cargo doors that I was looking into 
with a flash light to see what the frame looked like......surface rust......I 
want to get it out and was wondering if it would be easier to take the cargo 
floors out and clean and treat or visa versa with the belly pans......I have 
to replace the right side belly pan, rocker, and cargo floor(not much of the 
cargo floor just what the PO cut out).........Looking for any suggestions for 
my plan of attack..........All  help greatly appreciated.........
