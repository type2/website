Subject: postcard from p &amp; c

Well, leaving the Riggen reunion in Glen Rose, Texas we were undecided which way to head. We stayed a couple nights at cousins Ray &amp; Donna's in Granbury, changed out the starter (it was acting up occasionally) and they took us for an early evening cruise in their pontoon boat. So Tuesday morning we decided on west and headed for Philip's cousin's in Lubbock. It was a long day's drive, especially when we waited until the next town to get fuel and there were no services. The last 44 miles were a bit disconcerting but we made the fuel station in Port, TX. Of course as we left the station, having put in 14.6 gallons, the truck sputtered and hiccuped so it looks like we barely made it.

We will be here a day or two? Philip is helping get a car in shape and time for another oil change for us. Then we are looking at heading into north east New Mexico, high in the mountains where it is cooler. We had a few suggested destinations in the area. Plan on making the VW show near Colorado Springs the weekend of 8 August so we have some time to travel.

Time for the newest travel postcards. They are posted at
