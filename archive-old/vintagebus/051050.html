Hi Rich,
What type of filter are you using?  Wix is what we use and we have heard good 
reports about Mann filter.  Most of these two brands use internal relief 
valves.  Fram filters without internal relief vavles do explode as we know 
from experience!  Still would be a good idea to run an oil pressure gauge, 
especially for cold winter morning start ups when the temp is below 50F.
