Subject: Special Texas plates
To: list_at_hvwc_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

For those who were interested here's the link to all the different license 
plates available in Texas.
http://www.dot.state.tx_dot_us/insdtdot/orgchart/vtr/reginfo/spplates/specplat.htm
In most cases it costs an extra $25 to have the specials. Mine is $30. the 
extra money goes to different organizations so if you want to help &quot;keep 
Texas wild&quot; you can. Or if you are &quot;Lone Star Proud&quot; like I am you can show 
it. Or if you think &quot;Texas is like a whole other country&quot; (or something to 
that effect)
Plus you can personalize them for another $40, but you only get 5 letters to 
play with....
Thanks,
