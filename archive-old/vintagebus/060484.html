Subject: Re: [VB] AZ Bus Member in the News! =)

I second everything that Mr. Ellis has said about Jim Burnite.  In fact, Jim 
has made the trip from Yuma to Phoenix to work on the raffle bus just this 
past weekend, the weekend before that, and says he will again next weekend!!!

Thanks Jim!

And thanks to all those who have donated parts and time on this bus!

Jerome Jamboree - September 14/15, 2002, at the Gold King Mine in beautiful 
Jerome, Arizona.  Be there, or miss out!
