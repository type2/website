There is something that is being overlooked here, $$$$

My family's business is sheet metal stamping, and I have always wanted to make
VW parts.  For years I contemplated making the front emblem for splitties.  Our
sheet metal process is fine-blanking which typically holds tolerances of +/-
.0001, yes 1 ten-thousandth of an inch.  This is way too critical for an emblem
and the cost of the die was $12,000.  Needless to say, I waited too long and
others beat me to it.  I can say that without a doubt that my part would've been
so close to the original that you'd have to be a trained expert to spot the
differences.

One of the people that produces the emblem now has offered to sell me his tool
for $8,000.  IMO it's not worth $100 for the junk it produces.

I spent well over $10,500 making all the tooling to produce my safari wiper
shafts.  Some of you have seen them and can attest to the quality of not only
the workmanship, but the material as well - 321 stainless steel (same as 316 in
many respects, will survive 100 years at the bottom of the sea).  I have just
recently broke even on my investment, after 2 years!

Think how much money it would take to manufacture safari windows! I'm guessing
well over $100,000 from start to finish.  Any of you have that kind of cash?
What happens if you spend it and 2 weeks before the production run of 3,000
pairs is done, someone else has flooded the market?

It's a very risky thing to do.  Izzy has a lot of guts, IMO, to undertake the
job and try to compete with the others that already have their name out there.

Keep that in mind when you trash these guys out there trying to do well for us
splitty owners.
