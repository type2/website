I posted this for a non-subscriber on the Type 2 list:

Can anyone translate/identify the application of this Westfalia Hitch?

WESTFALIA-WERK WEIDENBRUCK
Typ # 321 022                (what does this fit??)
Bauj.  1970          (Built in 1970?)
Prufz ~~ F 136               (Tested for what?)
2300KG
Gepr fur 1200KG          (Max. weight?)

It appears to be a hitch for a 1970 something but not necessarily a bus.
It does not fit the later bay bus for sure.  The owner would appreciate
any ID help and may be willing to sell this unit. Please respond to him
about the purchase stuff and maybe P-mail me the ID info?  I'll repost
any results to the Type 2 list.  Thanks a lot.

Owner is Chris &lt;JordanVw_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have seen a couple original westy hitches for bay windows that bolt in
before you put the apron in- across behind the motor (towards the back of the
bus) - the buses that came with them have threaded thingys in there that you
could install.   Baujahr means year of manufacture.
