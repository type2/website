&gt;.........

&gt; If you read your bentley/ muir books, and crawl under the bus, maybe what
the
&gt; mechanic says would make more sense.  read the muir like a novel, like
&gt; someone on the list said.   There are plastic pieces/covers under the axle
tube by
&gt; the fulcrum plate area some people call daisy wheels, that may have been
what
&gt; the mechanic said.  I learned them as Kaiser Spheres.   whatever.
&gt;........
&gt; sounds like you got a bus with typical lack of maintenance and years of
wear.
&gt;  Yes, this all costs a lot to pay someone to fix.

Is this a private conversation , or can any fool just jump in :) ?
Perhaps you should loan the Idiot Book to your mechanic :)
Lot of money ? You have a junk transaxle, and a junk engine.
But if it gets you to the shop and back, what more do you want:) ???
