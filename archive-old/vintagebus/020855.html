Subject: Re: [VB] Owner's manual for '67 Westy

Isn't the Kombi the basis for the Westy?  That would
explain why you had the Kombi manual.

&gt; Thanks for the info. Have the grey two part vinyl
&gt; manual holder w/VW logo on
&gt; the front and the original SO 42 instructions.
&gt; 
&gt; Interesting... because I just found out a friend of
&gt; mine has original
&gt; documentation with his '66 Westy and it comes with
&gt; the Kombi on the cover of
&gt; the manual.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe it doesn't matter which one it has .......

&gt; &gt; Mine came with the orange and white &quot;instruction
&gt; and maintenance manual&quot;
&gt; &gt; booklet, with the deluxe on the front, and an
&gt; instruction manual for the
&gt; &gt; SO-42 model westy, in a grey two part manual
&gt; holder with a small vw logo
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; the front.
