Hello Friends,

I was waiting for someone else to post a trip report, since I didn't get
to the camp-in till Saturday evening. At any rate, I took my 2 teenage
kids with me. There were about 9 buses there and kind of a laid back
crowd. Most everyone there was having too good a time to make a big deal
out of anything, so everyone sort of pitched in on dinner and sat around
having a few beers and talking buses.

As it got dark, we lit up some candles, sat under the Grateful Dead Xmas
tree lights and discussed issues pertaining to NEATO, Peach State
Transporters (the GA chapter of NEATO), and OBR (the NEATO newsletter).
There was no need for a fire, as the weather was perfect.

The next morning, my kids gave me Father's day presents (a pair of baggy
jeans and a very cool shirt), and a couple of us brought out instruments
and played some music. Everyone pitched in on breakfast, we all gathered
at a larger campsite for a group picture, and then individual pictures
were taken of the participants with their respective buses. A few of us
hung around afterwards, playing spades with an unusual deck of cards,
had some watermelon and a beer, then caravanned to the interstate. A
very pleasant weekend, indeed.

I'm not very good with names, so I intentionally left them out so I
wouldn't forget anyone. I guess that's a pretty short trip report, huh?

Now for the part about pictures and buses. I think that our buses are
kind of like our pets in that we tend to resemble them; or at the very
least, the way our buses look reveals a part of our personality. I like
to look at pictures of buses, but I also like to see the people that
drive them. One of the reasons I love buses so much is that I love the
kind of people that own and take care of them. I'm very fortunate in
that I work in a place that sells and services VW's, and I enjoy talking
to the folks as much as I enjoy working on their cars. 

I guess the point is that I'd like to see more people posting pictures
of themselves with their buses on their websites. You don't have to be
Mr. GQ or a model. Your bus doesn't have to be perfect, or even clean!
Some of the coolest people I know are those longhaired,
dirty-fingernailed-from-working-on-their-bus folks driving the old beat
up, primered long-term projects that they know every nut and bolt on. Or
the folks that tear their buses apart at the very seams, getting
everything back in to the shape it was in when it left the factory. Or
the folks that haul around stuff on long trips to help others out, or
make long cross country trips just to see the world. Or the folks that
just live life like it was a party, and their bus is the gracious host
of all their friends' excursions. Or even the folks that customize their
buses, make hotrods out of them and show them off on the strip downtown
to impress the girls (go ahead! Flame me!) When it all comes down to it
folks, we're the reason the buses are still around... Let's see some
pictures of you!
