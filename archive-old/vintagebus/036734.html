there are not any current early complete doglegs for the early(wide lip)
buses as of yet, but i do have a early dogleg skin (made by Scohfield,
in eangland)that you can use on a late (brazilian only) dogleg, these
doglegs
are fair and close in there own right to the originals, all you have to
do
is cut off the outer skin and weld the new outer skin on.

I will have another shippment from england by the end of the month.
the fire we had here on 11/26/99 has put me behind at least a month.
In my next shippment i will have besides the regular sheet metal,
complete cargo floors made by VW of brazil, early dogleg panels, rear
wheel
archs, single cab rockers, and a few surprizes!

ps. new online catalog should be up by BBB IV, we are all looking
forward to 
this. You will have access to my complete inventory by manufacturer,
part needed, year of bus, etc., with online secure ordering, no more
not knowing
what your getting, you will know if the part is german, brazil, mex.
etc.
this will give you options on your purchases.
