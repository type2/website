Subject: Placerville CA VW Show Report
Date: Mon, 20 Jul 1998 10:22:34 -0700

I've been off the list for the past week.
On vacation at a location with no phones,
cellular doesn't work there either.  Nice &amp; low tech,
much like an old VW bus.

On the way to the old cabin, I went through
Placerville, CA (42 miles east of Sacramento).
A nice place in the foothills, a little cooler than
the hot valley.

I attended last years show, and with a load of
kids (they got in free!) went to this years too.

Main reason for going was to get some needed
parts for the '67 HT, connection didn't happen.

We got there real late for a show, as we had to wait
until my daughter's attendance at a friends 
birthday party was no longer required.

Arrived at 2:00 pm or so, most of the swap area was either
gone or closing up shop.  The show area had exactly
ONE bus.  A very nice '63 Deluxe I had seen at the
recent Sacramento shows.  I looked closely at two
items of interest on this 'restored' bus.  My bus lacks
a battery hold down and a splash pan, so I thought
I'd check a 'good' bus for reference.  Disappointed.
This bus was in the same boat as I, it had neither!

There was a nice double door panel and a '61? 
single cab for sale, but didn't write down anything.

Kids got a small trinket each, fortunately no nice
T-shirts, so costs were kept down.

No squarebacks, two notchs, &amp; one fastback.
Many bugs and wetVW's of no interest to me.

May have been some more busses earlier and 
left by the time I got there.

Decent show, still small, low cost ($7) entry.

Probably some deals to be made, but trailing
4 kids (1 from Belarus who spoke no English, &amp; we
speak no Russian) made things difficult to stop
and dig into a pile of stuff.

I wonder what he thought of the whole thing!
He'll go home with a huge tire VW bug with a
pull string motor, how will he explain that!
