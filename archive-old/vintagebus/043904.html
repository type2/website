Hi Volks,
	
Well I did it! Yesterday I finally got my hands on a '62 that I have been
negotiating for about 4 weeks on. The final price for her was $1.00

She was abandend at a fraternity house about 1 block from me. I would see
her every day looking very pitiful, so last month I stopped and commenced
negotiations. Some high points:

- custom paint. She was painted in green and black camoflage with
housepaint applied liberally with brush. About four months ago she got a
repaint of all white (except for the all the windows, which remained in
fashionable black). Custom lettering included &quot;greek week&quot; across the
starboard side, &quot;If you aren't Greek, your a Geek&quot; across the port
roofline and various other phrases and Greek letters all over it. All
paint work was apparently done while inebriated. Any suggestions on
removing THICK paint from glass, hubcaps, etc.?

- lots of empty beer cans in the back

- wide white tire inserts, wheels and tires painted black, then white.

The Frat boys started geting roudy when they saw we wwere taking their
mascot, chanting &quot;don't take the bug, don't take the bug!&quot; I decided to
get out of there quickly. 

Since I live so close I used a tow rope and my friends t*y*ta camry. I
pulled out the drivers side window frame so I could see past the poor
man's limo tint (black paint) on the windshield. The short trip down
the residential street to my home took us past the police station. I could
see myself trying to explain to the cop &quot;but it does have tail 
lights...they're just painted white&quot;

On the way home a flock of kids started crowding around. They whooped and
hollered, following us down the street towards the police station like we
were the ice cream man or something. Not the best thing while your
trying to be inconspicuous! A police cruiser stopped for the parade, but
only to watch in amazement. A policeman walking out to his car did a
double take and gave me a strange look, shaking his head as we passed him.
It was strangely surreal.

The property manager got this horrified look and turned pale enough to 
match the bus, obviously stunned that we would bring this rolling
abomination in as we rolled pass the security gate into the condo complex.
That look alone was well worth the $1 purchase price! She doesn't like me
much anyway since I actually maintain my own vehicle (&quot;Why can't you go to
the Jiffy Lube like everyone else?&quot;)

Anyway, it's safe and sound in the garage (wife can't understand why I
would kick here P*ntiac out of the garage for the busses). If anyone wants
to host some pics of the extraction I could try to get them to you.

Happy Thanksgiving (happy Thursday to those outside the U.S.)
Todd
