Subject: Bently book question

Hi list,
Wanted to thank those that wrote back regarding original bus owners question I
had. I guess their all gone from what I've learned.
Also with regard to the dash repair, I got some good advice. My Japanese navy
friend is out of town for the moment and things are busy as heck
here(something about Iraq and north Korea) so our project is on hold.
Have one request though. Could someone pass me an address/price for the new
bently reprint for the 50 to 60 bus's?
Many thanks,
Mike Turner
