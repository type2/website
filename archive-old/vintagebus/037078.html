Hi Diana,
It shows that your number three cylinder is not as good as the others 
probably due to the fact that this one never seems to get enough cooling air 
and if you do not run a dog house cooler system it fairs even worse.  Next 
thing to do is to drop about a tablespoon of oil into each of the cylinders.  
Turn the engine over twice by hand and then check each again.  If the 
pressure reading goes up 5 or more Lbs. then the rings in that cylinder/s are 
worn the more the pressure increase the more the wear.  If no pressure 
increase in the low cylinder then it probably valve/s that are going bad.
