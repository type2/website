Subject: quandry

Dear All:

I have the opportunity to purchase a 67 westfalia on ebay.  The URL is
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=2488692185&amp;rd=1&amp;sspagename=STRK%3AMEWA%3AIT

I can get this bus for $1350.  The owner has not responded to my e-mails,
but he has a good record as a seller on ebay.

I realize the amount of work required to bring the body/interior up to
snuff, and I rebuilt my 1300 numerous times.  I've got the gas and arc
welding gear, so that's not a problem.

I got rid of my 66 campmobile 15 years ago for $75, blown engine, raggedyass
seats and broken bedframe.  I'm ready to get another bus.

Those of you who know the objective worth of a 67 bus please advise me as to
your opinion...

Thanks in advance...

Jeff Olson
