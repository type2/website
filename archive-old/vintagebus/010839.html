If anyone is interested in a already chopped shorty splitty there is one in 
Burney, CA which is east on 299 from Redding.   Take your first left as enter 
the town by the hotel on the corner.  All the way down or the right.  Sorry I 
dont know the name of the street.  It has been sitting there awhile but 
looked like a roller.  The things are sorta funny looking if you ask 
me.........
