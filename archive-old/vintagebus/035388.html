&lt;&lt; It might be a good idea for the Site to carry a message that states that 
if you are not on the AIRS list you shouldn't expect to get any assistance 
from the AIRS members. &gt;&gt;
Hi George,
We also thought this up today and then shot it down.  The problem with this 
is two fold:
1.  If one was not on the list all one would have to do is claim to be 
somebody on the list, preferably someone from far away so there would be less 
chance of the local listees knowing if it is a real listee or someone else 
using a list name.
2.  Or those whom want to could just join, but punch in a phone number off 
the top of thier head.  Thus AIRS ends up with all sorts of dead end numbers!
  So the AIRS list would have to take up issuing photo IDs and checking 
regularly all the phone numbers to insure they are correct!   Eric&amp;Barb
