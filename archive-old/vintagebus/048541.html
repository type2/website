&gt;that I ordered curtains for my '71 camper van, from PLFVW, on Sept 9th of
&gt;this year.  As of this date I have not received my curtains nor my
&gt;requested refund of $172.


I can't believe all this complaining I am hearing!!  You're acting like
$172 your life's savings!!  This isn't big business here, we are working
with VW people who are generally a bit slower (speed wise that is) than the
rest.

Remember in the western movies the old angry man with a stick beating his
lame horse tring to make it move faster, this is what this situation
reminds me of.  Dawn is having some personal problems at the time, but bad
mouthing her is not going to help.  In time, I hope PLF gets back on track
and continues to put out the type of product it always has.

I always enjoyed VW people because of their kindness and caring nature,
these people whinning and complaining are not true VW people in my book and
we would all be better off if they were not on this list.

Money is not the root of all evel, the LOVE of money is!  Being a teacher,
I have never enjoyed a large income, but what I make suits me fine.

Dawn, if I can help in any way, count me in!!  And when you get back on
your feet, you can be sure I will be ordering some more of your high
quality products.
