Subject: Re: [VB] Paint Cracks

I will admit that I made those same cracks in my do-as-you-learn body work
days. The Cracks are probably caused by the weld on the repair panels not
holding and cracking the thin bondo and the paint. There is no way to fix it
except to grind down everything and repair the weld properly.

I learned all this the very hard way.

&gt; Unfortunately its another PO problem.  It looks as though they used a
filler
&gt; to smooth some metal panels which inturn cracked, cracking the paint as
&gt; well.

&gt;
&gt; Not if you want it to look good. Also, I've never seen a new paint job
crack
&gt; due to inadequate drying. What products were you using and how were they
&gt; applied? Some manufacturers warranty their products if correctly applied.

&gt; &gt; Is there any amount of buffing, waxing, or any other treatment that will
&gt; &gt; cover up cracks in the paint, probably due to inadequate drying between
&gt; &gt; painting?
