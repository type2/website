Subject: Re: [VB] Help with (tranny?) noise

Worn out fulcrum plates and paddle ends of the axle shafts can lead to a 
clunking that seems very much like a broken transmission mount. I think 
oversize fulcrum plates are available.


&gt;So I've been getting a knocking/rattling sound when
&gt;  I disengage the
&gt;  clutch under a load (i.e. when starting up a hill).
