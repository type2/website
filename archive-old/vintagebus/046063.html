&lt;&lt; What I am asking is, would it be OK to get these parts from a VW 
pick-a-part,&gt;&gt;
Hi Rhunes,
Yes that will work.  Better yet carefully pull an entire wiring harness out 
of a totalled bus of about your year.  You will need wiring pieces later!

&lt;&lt; and connect the with the little tube and electrical pliers or will this 
cause shorts? I basically don't have the money for a whole new Harness. &gt;&gt;
NO!  Only soldering and heatshrink are trouble free.
 
&lt;Also there are a few parts I need. Does anyone know where to find a '58 only 
decklid? Any help would be greatly appreciated, or would it be a lot easier 
to just get an early decklid (pre '63)?&gt;&gt;
They are out there, but if all fails having a 59-63 lid around is not a bad 
thing even if you find the correct one later.

&lt;&lt; CAn anybody suggest a place to get the weatherstrippng and all that for 
the front doors, becauseI have all the glass, but no rubber or felt. &gt;&gt;
WW or WCM.  Check the archives for which is best for original look.  

&lt;&lt;And on a side note, is the rear apron on a '58 supposed to have the cutout 
for a tailpipe on the left side. I ask because BFY told me that when I bought 
their muffler, it was the only 36 hp type 2 muffler there is and the pipe 
comes out the right side.&gt;&gt;
According to our APR58 VW bus shop manual yes it is the only one for 36HP.  
If you plan on driving this around much you might want to make your own 
tailpipe to get the exhaust off to the right side into the airstream to 
prevent so much carbon monoxide swirling around in a cloud behind your bus.  
Which can be easily sucked through any of the engine/body, engine lid/body, 
or rear hatch/body seals and into the interior of the bus.
