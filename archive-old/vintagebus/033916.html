Hi Kyle,
Well both are great to show those who have problems excepting that oil turns
so acidic and causes so much damage.  One has a hole about the size of a
american nickel and the other is missing the area that the sump plate attaches
to.  Both show incredible damage on the inside where the oil sat in the case.
Also both were fairly low milage 25 HP engines that we are hoping to save the
lesser damaged one with a little welding.  Have found simular damage in cases
from 1200-1600cc engines.          Eric &amp; Barb
