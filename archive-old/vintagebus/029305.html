Offend Shawn??  I wonder if thats possible?  He's just a schmuck anyways ;-)
By all means...if you've got the loot to restore a bus...go for it!  I hear Lenny
Copp does an excellent job... maybe its been mentioned?  I haven't been following
this thread to closely.  Put up some pictures of the bus if you can...we all love
pictures!

Isaiah

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; I am new to this list and if I have offended anyone, my sincere apologies.

&gt;  &gt; Hello all, I was wondering where I could get a job so I could afford to
&gt;  &gt; spend 15-75k on restoring my bus. Let me know where to send my resume. I
&gt;  &gt; would be willing to relocate to mars for that kind of spending money.
&gt;  &gt; Unless some kind soul out there would like to donate the money to me. In
&gt;  &gt; that case I won't send out my crayon written resume.  Shawn &gt;&gt;
