I have access to an air compressor.... but its more trouble than its worth.
I know there is something seriousely wrong with that cylinder...and it has to
be torn down anyways...so why do the test when its going to tell me something
I already know... something is screwed up in that piston/cylinder.
If it weren't something so serious....i might do that...but as for now...I'm
just going to pull the motor and tear it down.

Can I replace just one piston/cylinder or should I replace all 4?
