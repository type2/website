Hi, Mr Swangstu here, I have not followed this thread
100% but here is what I can toss in so far...

&gt; Ummm, that is interesting. I have seen SO-23 kits up
&gt; to late 1961 that
&gt; utilized the yellow/black plaid combo. Even some of
&gt; the literature I have on
&gt; the &quot;Mosaic&quot; options in the early 60's show the
&gt; yellow/black plaid. Maybe
&gt; Mr. Swangstu knows for sure. 

Yes Ben is correct, The yellow and black plaid and the
Red and Black plaid where available at the same time
between `59-early `61 on the so-23s and Camp Box
interiors.  The different color buses had the
different color interiors.  Example Sealing Wax red
and Beige grey buses had the red and black...the dove
blue and the sea gull gry -palm greenys had the yellow
and black...late so-23s in `61 had a non-plaid
material probably when supplies ran out before the
style change in `61...but that is another thread all
togehther :-)

&gt; Regardless,
&gt; there are some noticeable differences between a 55'
&gt; and a 59-60' kit.

Correct again Ben, There is some significant
differences between a `55 and `59-`60 Kit...it is
close but not a correct `55  kit.

Interesting thread...I have not seen a good westy one
in a while!  I will read the other post on this one
too!
