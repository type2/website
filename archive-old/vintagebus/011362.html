Subject: front splash pan
Date: Mon, 22 Jun 1998 20:07:20 -0500

Isn't it great what you can learn if you pay attention?  There was some
discussion a few days ago on a front splash pan.  I got thinking about my
1960 panel and realized there was no pan up (under?) there.  I assume that
there should be, that area is amazingly clean and rust free.  (I pulled the
van out of a field where it had been standing since 1986 or so.  The guy I
bought it from said the PO died in the midst of working on it ((not an
omen, I hope)).  The story I was given is that the daughter threw the
disassembled engine and assorted parts away, and sold the car.)

Anyway, the question now is, what will fit in my car?  I have access to a
1971 and 1968 in the local junk yard, I am not sure if they have this pan. 
If they do, will it fit, even sort of?  If they will not fit does anyone
know where I can get a pan, it seems kind of important.

Any suggestions will be appreciated.

Thanks
