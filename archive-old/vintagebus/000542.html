&lt;&lt; They were history.  I replaced them.  Are the boots for T2's and T1's 
different?  I told the counter jockey at my local VW parts place for Bus 
boots, but when I went to put them on, they seemed too small at the large 
end.  The axle tube end was fine.&gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Hmm, we have heard that there is a differance in axle tube sizes, but not in 
the axle tube retainer end of the axle boot.  Maybe someone else on the list 
knows more about this!  Hint, hint... :)

&lt;&lt;How about the pivot shaft bushing?  Smaller on a bug tranny?  The one he 
gave me was too small...I reused the old bushing.  &gt;&gt;
Hmm, do you mean the tranny nose cone bushings for the hockey shifting stick? 
 If so they have to be reamed to the proper size, and to keep the two aligned 
inside.   Eric&amp;Barb
