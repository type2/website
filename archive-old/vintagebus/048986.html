Subject: 69 shorten Bus
Message-Id: &lt;s7fdb10b.068_at_iusb_dot_edu&gt;

Drove past a car lot this morning that had a shorten 69 bus for sale. 
($1750.00)
Body needed work and the interior needed some attention.  Not sure of the
size of the motor but it is a single port.  
I send this post for two reasons, What do shorten buses go for, is this
any kind of deal and is there anyone out there wanting me to get more
information on it.  The car lot was closed and I didn't get their number
but I can.
I apologize to any purest out there that want to keep the list strictly
split but this is the only list I belong to.

Kevin
