I have a  feeling there is a check ball in some circuit (just a guess) that

open and letting gas flow out of the bowl.


Hi Steve,
Any other circuit in the carb drains fuel out of the bowl.  The only  way for 
enough fuel to get into the bowl to overflow is through the float  valve.  
Check out the possible problems we previously listed, and put  back on the 30/31.
