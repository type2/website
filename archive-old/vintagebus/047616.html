Hi Everett,
Yes, but like the 1960 KG manual which shows a Bastard 40 HP engine in it 
though as far as we can tell this engine was never installed in production 
Ghias.  How did this happen then?  VW was probably going to use the Bastard 
40 HP engine in the 60 Ghia and just before production of this year started 
VW dumped this engine due to it's major design flaw.  Still this resulted 
with a photo of a Bastard 40 HP engine with KG 1960-69 taillights.
  Since the move from BD to non-BD was so huge a change VW was probably 
beginning to do the planning, producing press dies and testing of the new 
prototype VW bus by 53 or early 54.  Kind of like the KG prototype built in 
1953.  It is the only known KG that came from the Karmann factory with a 
stock 25 HP engine!
