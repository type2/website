&lt;&lt;I was thinking about the overhead vent change that Cameron had described, 
and 
though I cant remember anything on the part above you head, could you mean 
the change for the on off switch on the left side of the vent?    I am still 
not sure exactly where you mean the changes are.

&gt;&gt;

Yes.
Hes refering to the stampings of the entire overhead vent systen.
The flat area with the directional control knob.
Early, somewhere around 57orso they have three parralel lines, the later ones 
have a big flat section with a sqaurish impression.
