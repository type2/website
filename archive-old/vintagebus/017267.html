Subject: main tank size

I recently got the reserve tap working in my 1960 Standard bus, so
I've become more willing to drive closer to the edge of running out
(since then all I have to do is switch tanks and find a gas station).
However, my most recent fill-up (which didn't involve switching tanks)
had me putting in 10.24 US gallons.  How big *is* the main tank?  I'm
worried that the reserve switch is backwards (although I didn't get
sputtering when I experimented with switching over before filling up),
or that the pick up tubes are damaged such that I'm effectively always
on reserve.  It'd be a real bummer to run out, switch to reserve, and
find nothing there....

Thanks.
