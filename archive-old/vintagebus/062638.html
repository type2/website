Subject: H4's

All this talk about the bad H-4s has gotten me worried.  I ordered a set of 
H4 upgrades about a year ago from The Bus Depot, all in preparation for my 
ongoing resto.  Now I am worried that I might have gotten a set of these 
poor-quality lights from India.  How can I tell for sure what lights these 
are (is there something as obvious as &quot;Made in India&quot; on them)?
