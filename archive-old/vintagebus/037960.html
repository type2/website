&gt;In the process of assembling the exhaust I bought and have installed a
bus muffler, silencer and tailpipe.  All well and good.  The mystery is
that the silencer and tail pipe run over to the driver's side of the bus
and then point rearward.  Now, the valance for the '67 has a divot cut
into it that looks like the silencer for this year of bus originally came
straight back from the muffler, like a bug peashooter. I am willing to bet
that the muffler, silencer and tailpipe I bought were really made for a
'68-71 bus with a T1 engine and not a splittie.

Now a bug peashooter does not fit in the hole in my muffler for the
silencer, so if it did look like this, then it was a special peashooter
for the bus only.  Did this exist? does it? or was the '67 muffler special
in having a tube off the muffler that fit a bug peashooter? If so, does
there exist a single outlet (bus) muffler with an outlet that will fit a
bug peashooter?

I am not quite sure what the problem is.  The valance (removble apron piece 
behind  the motor)    should have a  factory notch half circle (one)  as the 
damper  pipe goes rearwards from the muffler under the valance apron, then 
turns  to the side, then  the tailpipe curves back  and also under the bumper 
to vent the exhaust rear wards  .    67 was the same as 40hp .   (in terms of 
pipes, the 40hp muffer does not fit a 1500 or 1600)    The 36hp buses did not 
come with this side piping, and the valance/apron does not have the half 
circle cut out as factory.
It sounds like you described this.    SOmetimes people have put bug mufflers 
on buses and cut an extra hole on the other side.

Secondly, do you really have to remove the engine to adjust the clutch?  I
am only semi-serious on this one, but there is an undercurrent of
seriousness.

no you don't have to.  there is a way to get an arm unde rthere.   can be 
turned easily by hand w/o vice grips on cable if the threads are clean of 
grit/rust, and have been greased.  When you pulled the motor it is a good 
idea to clean the threads and greas eit up and make sure the wingnut turns 
easily by hand.    I lie uner the bus and I think I reach my aarmd over the 
axle tube from in front.  I would have to go do it to figure out how I do it. 
 I thinkI  scoot under from he back and lie under the tranny like I would hug 
it.  (good tranny)   reach right arm forward to clutch cable and wing nut.
