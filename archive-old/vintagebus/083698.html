&gt; razorblade!
&gt; moral of story: if you are a pro who never makes mistakes, use the
&gt; orange goo. otherwise, use permatex and unwaxed dental floss (gonna
&gt; try that one tomorrow).

VW de Mexico uses Hylomar on the case split.  Never hardens, and hasn't
started to leak yet on either of my years-old Meximotors.
