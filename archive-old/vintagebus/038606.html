Thats a generous offer Ken, unfortunately im in the land of rednecks and
shorebillies known as the Eastern Shore of Maryland (Ocean City).  I am
gonna try to look at this on the bright side and take  this oppurtunity to
do some extras on the bus.  Clean and restore the gas tank, put a 12volt
sending unit in it, paint the engine bay, new exhaust and maybe a new carb.
Has anyone put differential rockers in and would they reccomend it?  Im
looking for a few performance add ons without straying from the stock engine
too much.

Emmet
