Subject: New Mexican Bus Miracle!

Over the years, we all have heard of folks taking extremely adventurous trips
in thier VWs. These include the Zebrabus African adventures, cross-continental
trips, Maynard in Mexico, trips up to the farthest Northern reaches of Alaska
as well as traveling at risk to the Southern tip of Tierra del Fuego. As yet, I
have not had the opportunity to do these types of travels.

Every traveler gathers experiences that make excellent campfire tales. 

Here is a story that happened about a month ago near a little town in Southern
New Mexico. 

A buddy of mine was on the way back from the annual RT66 Buses and Balloons
event. Here in the Southwestern USA, there are looong stretches of dark desert
hiways with nothing in between. My friend was tooling along in his splittie
when all of a sudden he heard the painful BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR-k-nock, k-nock,
k-nock sound of a rod bearing going out. Dang! He pulled the bus over to the
side of the hiway. You know the kind that has jacksh** for a shoulder and only
one lane in each direction. The guy had no option but to start walking and
thumbing for a ride as he went. The the storm was so strong he could hardly see
a few feet ahead of him as the headlights of the rare passing car went by. As
you know, these kind of roads are so dark that it is literally impossible to
tell where the road is unless you walk right on the edge and use that as a
guide. Bad weather, bad road and the dark of night in the desert is not
condusive to getting a ride. 

Suddenly he saw a car coming towards him and stop.

The guy without thinking about it got in the car closes the door just to
realize there's nobody behind the wheel. The car started silently and slowly.
the guy looked at the road and saw a curve ahead. The car increased in speed
and continued toward the curve. Being a man of faith, he began to pray and
begged his Lord for his life. He said that he was still in a state of shock
when just before the car hit the curve, a hand appeared thru the window and
moved the wheel.

The guy, paralyzed in terror, watched how the hand appeared every time the car,
which proceded in eerie silence, needed to navigate a curve.

My buddy said that he gathered the strength to get out of the car and ran to
the nearest town. Wet and suffering from shock he stumbled into a cantina and
abreathlessly ordered two shots of El Tesoro tequila. He told his tale to
everybody about the horrible experience he went through. 

A silence enveloped everybody when they realized the guy was crying and wasn't
drunk. All of the bar regulars settled into their routine habits and considered
the tale another mystery of the desert.

About half an hour later two guys walked in the same cantina and one said to
the other. &quot;Look Pepe, that's the a**hole that got in the car when we were
pushing it.&quot;
