Subject: Re: [VB] My new find

Yep, I know who owned it.  Me.  It is a '66 by the way and was always a
Midwest bus.  Jerry G. never saw it let alone owned it.  Also I don't
believe the miles are original either.  I actually owned it twice.  I owned
it, sold it to George Brett of the KC Royals then bought it back from him a
few years later then ended up selling it to the Discover Card people.
Around the KC area it is also known as the Brett Bus.  It is/was a very nice
bus then they airbrushed the hell out of it.  Oh well.  Where can I find
current information on it?

&gt; Hey All,
&gt;     If some of you remember a few years back, Discover Card purchased two
&gt; low mileage buses and had them painted by the Jerry Garcia Foundation to
&gt; then be given away via a sweepstake.Well, I received a call the other day
&gt; from a friend telling me they were for sale locally, so I dropped
everything
&gt; I was doing and went and had  a look at them.Well, I bought them on the
&gt; spot.
&gt;     One is a 59 microbus with 22,000 original miles(still has the 40 horse
&gt; bastard motor)
&gt; and the other is a 65 21 window with 62,000 original miles.Both have  WILD
&gt; graphic paint jobs from bumper to bumper  and are &quot;signed&quot; by Jerry.
&gt;     The reason I'm posting this to the list is, I'm trying to find out the
&gt; origins of the 65 deluxe.I know the 59 came out of Pennsylvania and was
&gt; mango green and sea gull grey and many people were disappointed that
&gt; Discover took such an original, cheery bus to use for the graphic paint
&gt; job.The 65, I was told, was once owned by Jerry Garcia.But I'm unsure of
&gt; this. Does anyone out there know who owned this bus before Discover card
&gt; bought it ?? There is a Missouri Vehicle sticker on the Drivers
windshield.
&gt; I would appreciate any info. !
&gt; I'll have pics up soon.
&gt;
&gt; THANKS,
&gt;
