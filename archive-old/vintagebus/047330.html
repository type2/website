&lt;&lt; One more thing.  I am putting a new P/C set in.  Do I need to have someone
 balance the pistons?  Do I group according to weight??  &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Best to balance them!  the factory only goes so far about balancing.  To do a 
really goo job you need to balance the pistons with wrist pins and connecting 
rods to within a gnat's ass instead of several grams.  The more the parts of 
the engine recipocate are balanced to each other the better.  You really can 
do a darn good job yourself by building a simple balance beam like in the 
Idiot's Guide by John Muir.  On the other hand if you are going to use a CW 
crank you would do well to have the flywheel and clutch pressure plate 
balanced by a shop.  The less out of balanced the less vibration, the less 
vibration the less noise from the engine.  Which results in an engine that 
does not vibrate itself to death and a little more HP to the wheels instead 
of creating noise.  Not to mention the less noise to the interior results in 
the driver to be able to stay more aware of road and vehicle conditions over 
longer periods due to less fatigue from noise pollution.   Eric&amp;Barb
