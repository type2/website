Wouldn't it be cheaper and more bus like to actually buy another beater bus 
while yours is in the shop? And then, you wouldn't have to sit behind the 
computer screen faking a split screen? And then when your bus gets outta the 
shop, you could sell the beater bus.

&lt;&lt; Hey i thought i would throw this out. how about a split window bus 
simulator 
 i would buy it. It would be a real joy for us busless or our  bus is going 
 under a resto guys(and girls). So is it probable? Is it insane? I know some 
 of you are programmers I know this is a friday topic but hey we got to have 
 fun. &quot;(almost pretty fly for a bus guy Kirin Jacobsen)&quot; &gt;&gt;
