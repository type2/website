Hi,

I shipped a door via UPS and it came to around $20.

 I've found quite a few passenger doors for my '65 single
cab. The problem is the cost of shipping such a large/heavy
item. Due to the shipping, I've passed on a few really good
ones. I've found others where the current owner was not
willing to ship. Sooo - are there any New England, Eastern
New York, Northern New Jersey listees with a door they would
like to part with. It would be my pleasure to help you
liberate some of that valuable storage space.
