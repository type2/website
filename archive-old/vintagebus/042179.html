Hey folks.

First, before i even start, let me mention that I am NOT looking for
answers that involve POR or other very snakeoilish innovations.  If that's
all you have to mention, keep it to yourself. :)


So.

I began, rather reluctantly, some exploratory surgery today on the roof
and gutters of my 66....those who have met this bus are probably familiar
with the areas on question.

These are a few years old...the little spots along the gutter are the
areas that were in question...and have only grown worse over the past two
years.


So, being bored, I yanked out the angle grinder and a half dozen various
wire wheels and started at some rust removal....and found..well..what I
was afraid of finding.

First off, the bus has been repainted at some point in its past..a nonvw
red and white vs the original biege grey and titan red.

On the roof, I found a good thick layer of either filler or a high fill
primer.  A bit under 1/8&quot; or so for the most part.  Some areas I even
encountered the original-looking titan red under this!!  So I suppose the
outside of this one was bottom color first. (interior biege grey, of
course.)


Towards the gutters, this trend of thick primer/filler continues..and gets
thicker.  The gutters are actually nearly /full/ of filler.  NOT seam
sealer, which would be expected and understandable.  

anyway.  curiousity bit, so i dug in a few spots that are still smooth and
unbroken by rust.  Under that paint and primer, all of the metal I
encountered is /very/ /very/ pitted.  Sigh.  I guess that explains the
thick coat..sigh. so eventually all of that will have to come off...since
these pits are all slightly rusty.


ANYWAY.

To the point.

Dug out the filler in the seams, only in the areas where it has cracked,
coming out, or just plain rusty..down to to nice gutters below.  Pitted
to.  The seam area doesnt look /to/ bad..but.

This is where I am wondering.

What should be done to this, short of disassembling this seam and
stripping it completely clean and reassembling?

If its rusty on this side, its obviously rusty down in between the
sections of metal..what can be done to prevent this from continuing?  An
acid-type rust removal might get the obvious stuff...but further in?

suggestions?


thanks....david
