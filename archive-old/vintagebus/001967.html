Hi All,

My rear passenger door lock mechanism in my 59 double cab is shot...  The
part that the handle goes through with the square hole in it is wore out and
wobbles around.  The rest of the parts look OK.  The latches I have found
all have the little lock lever on it.  Mine does not.  Does anyone know if I
could get one of these other mechanism and scavenge internal parts from
it???

OR, if someone has one of these, let me know.

TIA.

David
59 double cab.

(and still looking for a front shift rod for a pre vin# 505000 bus)
