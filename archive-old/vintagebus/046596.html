Hi John,
It is on the forward side of the horizontal part of the manifold just left of 
the carb.  You need a small mirror and a flash light to read it or take it 
off the engine.

&lt;&lt;I'm quite interested because my oil bath air cleaner doesn't seem to fit 
right I have to jam it onto the carb and it hits the top of my engine bay - 
so..... I think that there must be a better one for me.  &gt;&gt;
What is the part number of your air cleaner?  Eric&amp;Barb
