Subject: The MAN!

Just have to give a mad shout out to the man Kelly &quot;Metwiz&quot; Brown.  I
ordered some metal parts from him and he sent them off with out even so
much as a penny in hand.  I later got a e-mail that they were on their
way and a total.

The parts came today, and they are nice.  Especially since these are
things (inner B- pillars, and close outs) that NO ONE makes.  I don't
have a press/brake or metal streach/shrinkers, so I'd have had to find
the always rusted out items off a rust free bus...time consuming.
Reasonable prices too.

Kelly even wrote directions on the panels for proper installation as far
as orientation goes.  Lets see WW or AS do that.  Plus he's more than
willing to help via e-mail and you can see the installations he is doing
over the net.  Cool.

Thanks Kelly.
