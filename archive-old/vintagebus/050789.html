Hi Rich and TJ,
First get a wiring diagram of your year and type of VW.  Check all 
connections using the wiring diagram and better yet remove each and reattach 
each on at a time.  This makes sure everything is connected properly and 
helps clean up the connections.  Make sure all the light bulbs are working 
one by one, bulb holders are cleaned of corrosion and will ground to the body 
properly.  For buses made before 1970ish it is important to make a home made 
grounding system going between the tail lights and directly to the battery 
ground strap where it bolts to the body.  Solder the ground wire ends to the 
bulb holder socket if they are steel.  For Euro cast bulb holders the best 
you can do is drill, tap and screw on the ground wires.
  Remove the wire going from the coil to the condensor on the distributor.  
This keeps the points from burning while you have the ignition key on while 
testing the wiring system.  
  Test everything, and if the blinkers work great!  If not you might have a 
bad signal relay or incorrectly wired.  Some after market relays come with 
two or three connections and these often are marked at the connections 
differantly from the stock ones.  Some of these require two of the stocker 
pre-1966 wires to the signal relay to be doubled onto one connection on the 
relay while the other wire slips on the one connection left or one of the two 
connections left!
Hope this all helps, Eric&amp;Barb
