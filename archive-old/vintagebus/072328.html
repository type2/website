Subject: Re: [VB] cell phones cross country

There were areas where our cellphone wouldn't get a signal while we were on 
the road. As a matter of fact mostly while we were in the southwestern states. 
It would've been nice if we had a CB, in case of emergency. If you broke down 
on the road and have no signal on your cell, you could at least ask truck 
drivers over CB to contact the State Trooper or Highway Patrol for a wellbeing 
check. If you can, I'd suggest carrying both cellphone and CB. 

Have fun and good luck on the road.
