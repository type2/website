Jon,

You are describing the Aero Papyrus White interior from a 1966-67 
Sea Blue/Cumulus White Deluxe.  If it is a '66, it may have also 
come with blue floor mats, which are VERY desireable (and semi-rare).

I agree w/Dave.  The 66/67 blue/white interior panels have a shiny light blue
(maybe a tint of green but really I'd called it a light shiny blue) with a
white creamy  as the offset colour.   The como green is a bright ferny green,
with the offset colour being a green hatched marked pattern, exactly the same
pattern as the greyish/tannish interior of the april 61- 64 SWR/BG  buses, but
in a green.   it is definately green.  No doubt about it. 

and yes the 66/67 deluxes came with blue floor mats if they were blue/white,
and tan if they were red/white or green /white (mesh platinum interior)   Bet
someone out there would just love those panels you found. for there 66 or 67
