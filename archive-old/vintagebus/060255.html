 that's what I think but after talking to Ronnie I decided to ship it. At least here I can look it
over, make sure everything is in order. Bus is missing wipers and both mirrors.... other than that
it's all OK.... should be fun to drive it cross country.

Someone told me to stay away from Hurst...... why? I got the best quote from them so far... $775.00


thanks,
