&lt;&lt; Anyway, I poured gas into the car with a small cup thinking that I would at
 least get it to kick over a few times.  Nothing.  This perplexes me since I
 feel that a minimal explosion should have occurred.  Everything else checks
 out fine.    Should pouring gas in the mouth of the carb been enough for an
 explosion or was it a futile attempt with a bad carb?  Any
 comments/suggestions are appreciated.

Hi Todd, 
Filling the fuel tank over at least half full will make the fuel at or higher
than the carb level in 1955-67 buses (Except single cab trucks.), we have
actually removed the fuel pump from between the fuel tank and the carb and
driven home when the fuel pump went out.  Also have in the past taken a old
plastic fuel filter and cut the upper section off this leaves you with a tiny
funnel tha one can add a little fuel to the carb directly to get the engine
going and thusly fast enough to get the fuel pump to suck it's first fuel into
itself.  When a fuel pump has sat for a while it gets dry of fuel and
sometimes needs more RPMs to get the fuel into itself to prime itself.  Of
course it is a good idea to check the fuel pump rod for the right hieght and
possibly clean grease and make sure that the fuel pump is in good shape.
