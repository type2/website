Actually, I haven't really inspected that hole much in the 10 years I've
owned the bus. Spiders kind of give me the creeps, and that time I was under
the bus and looked up to find a huge black widow staring down at me didn't
help. I have quickly reached in there to retrieve something that fell in
(quart of oil, rag, screwdriver) but never really cared to keep my hand in
there for very long :-)

Maybe I'll brave it this weekend and see what I can find. The PO did put a
wooden lid with hinges over the spare tire indent in the left rear corner
(spare was on the nose). It's hidden under the carpet back there. I found a
crusty old pipe in there when I bought it.

&gt; Whats in your hole?

&gt; That is my fear every time I buy a used vehicle.
&gt; Rationale for doing what I call a &quot;roach check&quot;.
