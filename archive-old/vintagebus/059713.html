Subject:  [VB]  difference 36 nut rear brakes vs 36 Big brake option vs 64 and up ?????

Hi I'm looking at my 1963 rear brakes 36 mm nuts, they look just like '64
brakes with the 46 mm nut any other differences I can look for? I was going
to put the '64 trans/ reduction boxes in but IF I already have the big
brakes I'll just have this one rebuilt. I like the gearing it has now . It
came with a 1500 but there was no M code for the big brake option only seat
belt mounting. Lloyd in Eureka, Calif
