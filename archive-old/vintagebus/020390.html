I need to get home.In checking things out on my overheating motor, I've taken out the rear (closest to exhaust) oil relief valve and spring.  When it fell out, I couldn’t see which end (cupped or solid) came out first.  I suspect this is important.  Please help me!  Which end goes in first???BTW I re adjusted the valves but still sounds the same.  Now though, there is a ominous knocking emanating from with in.  I might have killed this thing driving it today...we'll see.  I still have a hundred miles to go too.  Wish me luck.Steve
