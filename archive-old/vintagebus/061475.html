&gt; I am not sure. Any Ideas? I can email a pic.

Looks like an SO-44 but has a strange looking door on the (electric)
fridge, right?  SO-69.  Most often seen in the US under a dormobile-style
top...but available with both the small squarish top and the &quot;common&quot;
pops-forward top.  And possibly in a hardtop, though i've not seen any.
