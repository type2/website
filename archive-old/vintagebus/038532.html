&gt; I was planning to skip BOR anyway, but if Thom would like to lead a group of

&gt; consternation at the gate, not to mention traffic tie-up. Then we could go
&gt; have a nice picnic in a park somewhere shady and cool. Brings out the old

I thought I saw a protest coming.  As Thom is turned away I see listies
jumping out of van &amp; buses holding up banners and signs, Vehicles refusing
to move,  Front page news the next day announcing the alt. event.  Listies
taking a sit down in front of the gate...........

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
