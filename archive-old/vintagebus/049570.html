Subject: 65 nose skin

Well, I am still looking for a decent nose for the s/c... have even emailed
SEVERAL members of this list who mentioned they  were parting out/cutting
up  busses; no response (hey, if ya ain't serious, don't say it!)

SO. Again.

Any one out there have a good nose skin for a 65?
I need it from just above the bumper seam, to just below the turn signals,
side-to-side.

Doesn't have to be perfect, just repairable.  And a reasonable price - the
one I did find, I should just buy the whole bus for the guy's asking price.

Thom, is DBH still providing these skins to your knowledge?
