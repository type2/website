&gt; I think I recall 207/70 - is that correct?

I had an original 6.40 X 15 tire on the front of my bus as a spare when I
bought it. (It now has one of the Peerless specials JP recommends there)
I compared 215 and 205 /75 tires to the original.  The 205s were a little
smaller diameter and the 215s were a little taller.  They were both a
bunch wider.  I bought the 215s for my 58 but I don't recommend them on
the earlier buses as you'll be letting air out of the tires trying to get
them sqeezed in between the drum and the wheewell lip by the side of the
road somewhere. My spare is a 205.
