Subject: Seeking safari windows 

Hello everyone,

Do you know anyone that's trading away their safari windows assembly set
-- My wife actually approved the budget for me to get them! I feel
lucky. But I guess it takes more luck to actually get me one of these. I
have been advised that the repo ones are not necessarily the top choice.
But the original ones are so hard to come by. On the other hand, I
followed a link to the Creative Engineering site and requested info
about their repo, which is said to be the best, 'completely
interchangable' w/ the original style.... No replies after 4 emails in
the past week. Did you get yours from this source Thom? How can I get in
touch w/ them? I know Kelly Park is coming up, but you know how it is w/
family budget funds -- if I don't hurry up to spend it on one thing it'd
be eaten up by some other things. Help my bus get the great assesories
it deserve!

Thanks
Ricky
