&lt;&lt;  Arent the bearings exactly the same as the ones ussed in the bus? (at

configuration will be less than in a reduction box it would seem to me. &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
For the early 1964 and earlier buses they do use the same bearing in the 
outer, and inner side of the stub axle.  The thing is that with a load the 
inertia thrust being transmitted through four bearings instead of only one.  
The other problem is that if one uses a type 1 or 3 axle instead of the 
upper, and lower bus axle.  The type 1 and 3 axle will flex between the outer 
bearing, and the shovel handle when supporting to heavy of a  VW, and/or 
cargo.  This results in the inner race of the type 1 and 3 single wheel 
bearing being tilted in relation to the outer bearing race.  Which in turn 
pinches the ball bearings, and ruins the bearing.  Which in turn also is why 
VW increased the diameter of the splined end of the bus stub axle to avoid 
this problem on the outside end of the later 1964-67 bus stub axle when the 
bus cargo allowance was increased from 3/4 to a full ton!  Which made VW 
throw away the tooling for the about one year M216 suspension!
  The bus lower stub axle being so short of length between the two bearings 
is not going to have this flex problem due to this and the fact that the spur 
gear machined onto the axle strengthens this area even more!   

&lt;&gt;
Likewise!  :) Eric&amp;Barb
