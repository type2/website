I have a 67 Westfalia SO-42 Camper and I was curious as to where I
could get a wiring diagram for the extra electrical components due to
the conversion. Like the wiring from inside the Bus to the external
plug-in jack (120V). I also need a single-port intake manifold, without
a blocked heat riser tube, for this Bus. Does anyone out there have one
for sale, or know where I could get one? Thanks for your help.
