I'm torqued.  Those who know me know it takes a LOT to get me *really*
torqued.   I bent over and ponied up the $350, plus $150 core (c'mon, how
much is a core really worth?) for a brazilian locking column box.  I get
this thing in the mail today, which has some funky &quot;hammerite&quot; finish or
something - looks like stucco, and the threads for the steering wheel are
buggered beyond belief!  If you are going to take $350 (plus $150 core)
the LEAST you can do is run a freakin' die over the threads!

In addition, the item was shipped loose in a big cardboard box packed in
NEWSPAPER!  What the *hell* are these people thinking????
