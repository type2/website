drove two different 66 westys and loved every minute of it, lost the first 
one to rust 
in 95 and managed to find a good owner (read: welder) for the second one a 
few months ago. 
So I need to get rid of some parts because the quarters are getting kind of 
tight
let me know if anyone needs any of this -prices are negotiable and there just 
to let you know where my head is and its up to you to decide whether its up 
my ace:

65 wiper assembly - I'm pretty sure the pins that stick out of the bus need 
replacement,never saw it run never tried using it for that matter, but 
complete
came out of a 6 volt     $7

65 shift rod - beat up but has the ivory knob, boot and spring: $5

66 steering wheel - ivory is still pretty good, despite a 400 mile holiday 
run, 14 hours through a blizzard with a worn out steering box and drag link. 
(only one sobriety test! :-)   $10

66 aforementioned worn out steering box, complete with column, and that
little black bracket $40

66 head light bucket, rusty but complete (lens &amp; trim &amp; bulb too) : $7

66 air cleaner - fair condition, with elbow and carb piece: $15

65-66 interior light housings $2 each

40 hp fan shroud:  good shape   $15

6 volt generators with backing plate $10

66 driver door handle guts, rod, inner handle etc. $10

66 cargo door locking mechanism  $10

65 ashray $5

66 door hinge $5

plus a couple of weird chrome handles, some switches, lemme know and I'll 
check
