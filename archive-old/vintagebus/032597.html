Subject: Re: [VB] 36 hp fan shroud

go with the smoothie. if you look at the one with the indent, does it have
a hole for the choke cable?  chances are, no.  indented ones, from what
i've seen, are stale air 40hp shrouds.

&gt; The cutout is to accomodate a bug air cleaner.

&gt; &gt; I was looking at two fan shrouds last night and wondered which would be
&gt; &gt; correct for a 58....  One had a rectangular ~2x4 inch, 1/8 inch deep
&gt; &gt; indentation at the top facing out, the other did not.... my 58 manual
shows
&gt; &gt; a shroud that is smooth.  Any thoughts?
