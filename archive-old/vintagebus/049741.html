OK Heres what I found a while ago and never looked in to:

I guess I can figure its nothing VW put on there but, Under the bus mounted
on the transaxel is a switch, A pushbutton type switch, it dosent lock on
or off, I tested it on a volt meter, When its pushed it makes a connection
and when released it breaks the switch (on/off) Its pointing towards the
front of the bus On the linkage is a screw (right befor it enters the
transaxel) it almost looks like the switch was activated by that screw
pushing onto it when you shift in  to reverse except, It dosent quite hit
the switch. Anybody heard of such a thing befor? I was thinking it may have
been a dealer option reverse light or mabey a Sundial thing.

Is it even a reverse light switch or somthing totaly diferent?

Thanks for helping!
Chris Poage.
