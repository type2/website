 In the middle of cleaning &amp; vatting a set of 40 IDFs and had a quick
question.... does anyone know the primary settings on the set screws for
startup?
 Engine info- 1976 2000 bus block (cam unknown, but *NOT* made for the
street, (read-radical:)), balanced, blueprinted, heads cc'd &amp; shaved
(unknown compression ratio) I didn't build this engine, but can get more
info if needed...oh yea... running 110 octane purple fuel
 Carb info- 150 mains, 55 idle.(with a bag of mains jets 100-175 to
chose from)
Im not to familiar with Webers... so any info or tips are greatly
appreciated.
 Thanks,
 David Pierce
