Kabayo,
Forgive me for saying this I hate them but JC Whipme has them.

High current converter- Continuous capacities;30.0 watts (2.5 amps) with 5 v
input to 60 watts (5 amps) with 8v input. 81NE3904B  $89.99 ea.

Standard converter- Continuous capacities; 18.0 watts (1.5 amps) with 5V input
to 27.0 watts (2.25 amps) with 8v input  81NE3905R  $59.99

I am not recommending them, but they are out there.  If you get one of them
and they work out let me know as I need to do the same thing to run a CB.  I
could care less about a stereo, would rather listen to the engine.

Peace Brother,
