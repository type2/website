list:
i would like to install a cv rear suspension.
i'm taking a real hard look at that swingaxle,
and it just strikes me as a real silly way of
goin down the road , with your wheels tucked
in under like that.
is there any easy way to pop in a late bus trans
and half-shafts and stub axles, using the original
torsion bars and spring plate mounts, or even
modifying the original spring plates to fit the
late bus parts ?
i would prefer to not mount a beetle trans, i like
the beefier  late bus trans, and quite possibly would
go with the porsche transaxle for another nefarious
purpose which i won't disclose here, but i'm sure some
other listees would also like to explore this modification,
and we would like to use as many stock (i.e.junk yard)
parts as possible. anybody ?
