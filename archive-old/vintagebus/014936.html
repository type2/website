It's a bit of a hassle to pull a drive once installed, but it can be
done.  VW suppliers sell a special tool to do the job.

You might be able to push the drive upward by reaching down through the
fuel pump hole.  I did this while installing the drive in my new
Mexican engine, but the drive wasn't fully seated when I did it. 
Others have removed the spring and driven a wooden dowel into the hole,
using the dowel to pull the drive.

The distributor drive gear teeth have a bit of a twist, so you need to
push the drive down a few degrees counterclockwise from its intended
final position.  The drive will twist to the correct position as it
drops into place.
