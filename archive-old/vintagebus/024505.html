Subject: I found a governor, now what...??

            Yesterday I picked up a complete intake system w/ speed
limiter off a '66-'67 Bus for $25... In looking thru the Bentley '63-'67
reprint it talks about the governor set-up being an M-coded option on
Busses with the 1500 sp engine (which my '63 is) made prior to '65.

    It was my understanding that most Busses came with the speed
limiter...

    At some point a PO of my '63 Standard changed the engine out for an
&quot;H&quot; cased motor. As my Bus is also 12V, they had also bent the manifold
over about 5 degrees so the the stock carb accelerator pump linkage
clears the larger 12V generator.

    My question is...  On the early Busses with 1500 sp and 12V was
there a different diameter generator...??  Bentley says 6V=90mm,
12V=105mm...

    there is no way the stock 28 pict carb fits correctly, unless you
had a governor/speed limiter or a 40-50mm spacer...

    The other question: the new set-up has a 30-pict on it, OE would
have been 28-pict, is there any advantage/disadvanatge to using the
recently rebuild 30..??

        TIA...
