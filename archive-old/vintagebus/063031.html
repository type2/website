Subject: re:hole in heater tube

i think this is the biggest response i have ever seen on the list, you would
think i was talking about which oil to use. just a random gallon of gasoline
thrown on the fire.

i have yet to locate a digital camera-

my theory on the hole-as it seems some other folks have them...it allows the
air to go through the tube...if the tube were too airtight it would be more
difficult for air to go through the tube. kind of like the vw manual
suggestion to open your window a little when you turn the heat on, to aid
air flow.
