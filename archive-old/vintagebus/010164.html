You bet!  Dan Kinsey had a Binz and I cruised with him all over KC in it.
To me, the Binz Double cab is the ultimate bus because I could use it for
parts hauling/rescue missions and since I got to work on the Binz, I'm
totally familiar the underneath of the old beasts.  If the Binz was in good
enough shape, I could be convinced to cash in my driver for one.  Binz's are
really awesome in my book.

I did just get a good lead on a SC in northern TX.  I must admit I withheld
that advertisement from my listing of ads on my website.  It'll do up if I
decide not to buy it.  It's gotta be in good shape (better than my 67)
before I'd consider buying.  My 67 has no frame rot anywhere whatsoever...
