Subject: RE: [VB] Fuel Filter question, re-usable

A layer of strong tape wrapped around the glass helps make it more break
resistant. I use all metal ones though.

I ran one of those fuel filters on my 59 bug years ago.  The glass
broke, and gave me a really neat engine fire while doing 75mph at 9:30
at night.

Nothing a paintjob couldn't fix.  lol
If you run it, just make sure you secure it REALLY well.  You don't want
to chance having that glass break.

&gt; Hey Y'all,
&gt; Happy Friday.  While picking up brakes for my 71 Westy, I saw and
&gt; bought a
re-usable fuel filter made by BugPack.  It's the glass kind with the
replaceable screen inside. My question: Has anyone used these, and if
so, do they leak or clog easily?? Adversely, do they filter finely
enough?
&gt;
&gt;

implements of destruction and
&gt; headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
