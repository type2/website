Thanks to Steven Howell (a saint) who was gracious enough to mail me a
wealth of information on Weber carbs, I found that there is a tiny itsy
bitsy little spring on the choke assembly that holds the fast idle cam up,
or at tension, or something. Not sure yet, but I'm more sure than before
that this is what the problem is. Supposedly a friend of mine had it running
and driving (I was at the store) with rubber bands attached to the fast idle
and choke to keep tension on them, but it never worked when I was there :).
So now hopefully I'm off to see how this tiny little pin or spring or
whatever is supposed to attach to this damned fast idle cam. Thanks, Steven
Howell, and the 40 or so others who helped with suggestions. I should have a
car to drive now. If not, I'm sure I'll come back with more questions.
