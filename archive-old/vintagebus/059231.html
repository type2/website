&gt;
&gt;1) What year was the factory high-roof first available?

From September 1961, which would be a 1962 model.

&gt;2) What is the M-Code for this package?

M 222.

&gt;3) Were many ambulances done in a high-roof package?

No idea.

&gt;4) Were the windows in a high-roof normally positioned against the
&gt;belt-line or the roof? (They were welded over on this one.)

The M-code listing I have says M 222 was only available on models
211, 213, and 214, which are all panel vans.  I don't think you
could get a high-roof with regular Bus side windows in the back.
The '67 parts manual at the doc project backs this up:

&gt;5) How hard is it to find ambulance innards? (Besides &quot;Very VERY&quot;.)

I get the impression that the ambulance package was not sold much,
if at all, outside Europe.  So I don't think there'd be many innards
floating around in the US.
