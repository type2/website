Here's what I've got so far...in order of its usage:   I was assured that
everything would be compatible with all paints sold at that store.  I think
I'll be using a urethane enamel...acrylics are not legal in this area.

*DuPont &quot;Kwik Prep&quot;  2445   &quot;Stabilizes and conditions metal for priming&quot;

*Mar-hyde brand &quot;Ultimate 2k&quot; Primer-Surfacer with the same brand/type
catalyst and Dupont URO Primer-Filler Fast Converter

*DuPont V-27405 Low VOC Prime'n Seal Epoxy Precoat with DuPont 2705S Low VOC
Prime 'n Seal Mid Temp Activator and DuPont 1075S Chroma System Low Temp
Reducer

I spent my time after work today packing up the Craftsman compressor, and
tomorrow I return it and get the 6.5 horse 60 gallon Cable Hausfeld dealie.
I also have had enough of my little garage/shop being a frigging mess so I
stuck more nails in the exposed floor joists to hang stuff from.  So much
for insulation!

I am intending, perhaps, to mangle my current respirator and turn it into a
fresh-air delivery system using a vacuum cleaner and a large amount of
plastic hose.  There would be a delivery hose and an exhaust hose with Gene
in between.  I am not going to spend $1000 for a fresh air system!  I'm
broke as it is....

Thanks, everyone, for all your patience and support!  I can't wait 'til I
can really help someone with my experience and knowledge!  Oh what a
feeling...Volkswagen!

Later,

Gene
