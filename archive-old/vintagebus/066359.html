Subject: RE: [VB] Rust

  I've been using rust converters for over 20 years. I did the whole
undeneith of my 60 DC with Rusr Mort (tm) before painting with sewer
treatment plant gray industrial paint. If the fumes from, well you know,
doesn,t affect the paint I don't think our dry AZ weather will even phase
it.

ps. The paint took 3 days to cure and is rock hard, poor mans Por 15

Subject: [VB] Rust


This a general question. Are there paint-on or spray on paint that cover and
bond to surface rust? I saw a spray in Wal-Mart that claimed to turn surface
rust to a Black primer. Is this for real?? Anyone used this type product?
Thanks
