A timing analyzer is a timing light that allows you to dial in the total advance,
and set your timing at total advance rather than at idle.

&quot;Desired advance&quot; is a function of your distributor. Gotta know what dizzy you
have to figure that out.

Your distributor will achieve full advance at a certain number of RPM's, according
to model. Again, gotta know what your running for a dizzy.

&gt; I have a vacuum advance distributor, i recently learned how to set it
&gt; statically. but i am not sure how to advance it otherwise. It is not a 009
&gt; distributor, that is all i know about it, oh yeah it is a bosch dist., made in
&gt; germany. there are no markings on it as to the model # or type.
&gt; I asssume a timing analyzer is the same as a timing light?...how do you know
&gt; what you 'desired advance' should be? how do you know when your distributor
&gt; has achieved full advance.
