 1. 	I'm getting a short grinding sound upon acceleration after shifting from
 2nd 	to 3rd, and to a lesser degree, 3rd to 4th, just after the shift though,

ideas
 if you have 	any.  Clutch was replaced during trans replacement.&gt;&gt;
 Hi Jeff,
Hmm, check your tranny fluid level.  Due to the 90WT oil thickness it is easy
to push too much into the tranny at once and get a sense that it is full, when
in reality the oil has not settled down into the entire tranny.  This is
especially true if you do not fill the reduction gear boxes first, then the
tranny.  While filling the entire tranny is possible from the single fill plug
you will have to take the time to let the oil settle in everywhere.
 
 &lt;&lt;2.  The gear ratio on this rebuild seems WAY lower (especially 4th)
 	then the previous trans, which I assumed to be original.  I'm told that the
 	rebuild is from a '67 Bus but had a taller 4th gear installed, but it seems
 the 	opposite is true (this thing SCREAMS at 50mph)  My question is: Could a
 	mistake in the clutch / redux. boxes etc. replacement / assembly process
 	cause this, provided the gear ratios are as claimed?  I spoke with the
 	rebuilder and he was puzzled but offered to exchange the trans for another
 	and eat the $200 in shipping.  So now that the $550 I paid the mechanic is
 	blown. I suppose it's time for me to take the big plunge and consider doing
 the 	next replacement myself?  Get a better paying job? I need a drink...  &gt;&gt;
What are the figures of the tranny gearing that you got with the tranny?  We
can help if you have those gear ratios to figure what speed, RPM, with the
tire size you have.  You can do the tranny replacement and we suggest you do,
that way if you have troubles on the road far from home you have a better
chance of getting back.  Unless you marry your mechanic and take him/her with
you on all your trips.  We right now are helping Clara with moral support and
info with putting her reduction gear boxes and axles on her rebuilt tranny
center section.  So do not feel alone and know that you can easily do
everything, except rebuilding your tranny center section.
