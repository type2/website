Subject: Re: [VB] stud repair

John,

They make step-studs of various sizes, that you can enlarge and thread the
worn-out hole for the larger end, Loctite it in good and nice, and have
your regular threaded stud left where you need it.

&gt; guess I could either use some sort of insert or a bigger stud.  I like the
&gt; insert idea but I want to do what's best.
