Subject: one bus home from new mexico, one bus home from arizona

last month jon's shinny bus was left broken down in lake havasu at ronnie's house after our ill-fated attempt to drive to jerome.  after the busses and balloons show in albuquerque, we had planned on driving his blue bus to lake havasu, swap engines and drive the two buses back to california.  instead we had his bus that'd been freshly painted with house paint and a brush trailered like a show car to lake havasu.  jp was going to get the single cab from john howard and it somehow made sense for us to go all together.

after an all day drive (approx. 12 hours) in the cab of jp's '55 chevrolet panel delivery with an average speed of 55 mph, the three of us arrived in lake havasu to unload the house paint trailer queen bus and load up the single cab.  i drove the truck up onto the trailer and it was a little scary especially with four men yelling instructions to me and the truck idling high like it wanted to go for a drive on the freeway.  the truck, by the way, is in great condition and sounded awesome.  it's a testament, i think, to the high quality german engineering that the truck sounded so great and ran the short distance so well after sitting unused for all those years.

i was very glad that the night before i was able to drive the single cab up onto the trailer.  as it turned out jon is much to much a bus snob to allow the likes of me to help with an engine swap so i was relegated to moving the rear bumper and apron away from the work area and then to bring them back when needed.  so i dozed in the trailer queen while jon worked on the black asphalt.  when not dozing i'd get a cool drink out of the cooler and look at the thermostat in ronnie's garage.  at 10am it was 85 degrees in the garage.  jon worked on the asphalt in the sun until about 12:30 or 1 in the afternoon but i didn't feel too sorry for him.

after a shower, a nap and a stop off by ronnie's shop we hit the road about 3:30 and drove as far as mojave.  jon wanted me to drive the shinny bus.  it seems the trailer queen has an engine that'd had a dead rat in number four exhaust valve when jon fist got it and he wasn't so sure the engine would make it back to california.  also the shifting is kind of weird because the shifter is messed up making it easy to grind the gears while attempting second only, in actuality, to be pushing into reverse.  of course i thought those were perfect reasons that i should drive the trailer queen plus i didn't want the responsibility of hosing up the new engine during break-in.  we drove for hours through the desert and i thought it was real pleasant.  jon seemed to think i drove too slow at times as evidenced by his arm motions (&quot;hurry up, come on&quot;) out the bus window but the way i saw it was that the trailer queen and i were grooving together and we weren't interested in his opinions.  of course i know why his blue camper is his favorite bus now.

we hit the road again after spending the night in mojave.  i suggested that we take highway 58 to 101 instead of 58 to 46 to 101 because 58 is flat and straight.  what i discovered is that the portion of 58 i'd been on was as described but the rest of it, the remaining two hours, were actually winding and mountainous.  i received two thumbs down through the bus window from jon during the drive.  the only good thing about jon's taking my poor suggestion was that it put us below in-n-out burgers, which guaranteed an excellent meal and a somewhat happier bus driver.  of course the trailer queen and i were grooving the surprise drive through a beautiful part of california i'd never seen.  jon and i got back to monterey early in the evening feeling pretty road weary and we required a week and a half to recover from a month-long separation, the long drives, parental visits and full email boxes.

we'd like to thank everyone who helped us out.  we'd probably still be stuck without all the help we received.
