Hey Jim
maybe if you did commercials with animals, you'd attract a better class of
cliental. ; )

&gt; Dang! Clowns to the left of me, jokers to my right-here I am stuck here
writing
&gt; to you...
&gt;
&gt; OK, you got me! I am a son of a gun. Yes, sold a bus in pieces to Beto and
took
&gt; two whole days working on Matt's bus. Made him wait in the heat too. This
rat
&gt; bastard is offering to take that bus back just as it was sold in exchange
for
&gt; that truck minus that sorry excuse of a cash deposit that you left. I'd be
&gt; stuck having to resell the bus. It's a gamble with odds to the house. But
&gt; that's the kind of guy that I am. Trying to help out friends and what do I
get?
&gt; Gee whiz.
&gt; Hey, I guess that Beto and Matt are more familiar with going &quot;Down South&quot;
than
&gt; I am... Probably listen to twangy Texas music too! My suggestion is that
Matt
&gt; and Beto carpool to Phoenix and we all discuss the matter over a beer or
&gt; twelve.
&gt; Meet you this weekend at our club house near South Mountain. Be there or
be
&gt; sober.
