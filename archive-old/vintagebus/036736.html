when I did my 65, I got 1/2 gal each B-White and V-Green.    I really should 
have gotten twice as much green, and painted the entire  outside bus green, 
then painted the white over the top of it.   Supposedly gives a slightly diff 
shade.  That is what VW did, anyway.    I didn't get Glasurit, I got PPG, and 
spent a lot on paint and primer and mixers and fixers and cleaners etc etc. 
But the paint still looks good 3 years later.  I had no idea what I was 
doing.  Prep work is the key.   WHo is doing the painting and prep work?    
You can call a local paint shop and ask if they have the brand you want, and 
if they don't who does.
