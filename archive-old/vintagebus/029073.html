Subject: Fw: [VB] Finally getting to the engine... 

Before you pull the engine, grab the bottom pulley and try to push it in
and out. If it moves noticeably and makes a loud &quot;clunk&quot;, then your main
bearings are worn. Check for holes in your exhaust. Noises from the
exhaust can sound like knocking to the inexperienced. Check valve
clearances. Feel around under the cylinders (while engine is running)
for exhaust leaks between cylinders and heads. Do a compression check.

All that looks ok, pull the engine (not as difficult as it sounds). Pull
the fan shroud, intake, side tins. Remove the rocker arms, pull the
heads and cylinders. Keep track of which cylinders went where. Push and
pull the pistons, check for play where they connect to the crankshaft.
By now,  you should have found the source of the knocking.

Make sure you use torque specs when reassembling. If you need more help,
please pmail me.
