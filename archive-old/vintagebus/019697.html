Exactly.  Use the money you save to get on the AAA plus plan - you'll need it!

&gt; One thing that is interesting is that Bruce Anderson recommends dino juice
&gt; for pre '74 Porsche engines(pre 2.7L) due to different seal material in the
&gt; earlier cars.  He recommends 15W-40 winter and 20W-50 summer in dino juice.
&gt; &gt;From my experience with crappy VW aftermarket seals I would tend to agree
&gt; and stay dino juice on these VW type 1 motors.

I tried synthetic in my 911, and it leaked like a seive.  My motor was reasonably dry
before the switch, with only some seepage around the external oil fittings. 
After a week of running Mobil 1, it looked like somoene dunked the entire engine in
a bucket of the stuff, I'm not kidding!   It turned out to me a messy, expensive
experiment.
