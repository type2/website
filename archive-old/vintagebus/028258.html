Subject: Re: [VB] 62 Westy wood - where do you get it

I was able to get correct 5x5 birch panels from a local lumber yard.
Real wood stuff. Call around you might be suprised. One thing I strongly
suggest is to salvage as much of the original paneling as possible. You
will need it for templates to make the replacements. On my 65 nonpoptop
Westy I hade all of the old wood. Rotten but intact enough to lay out
the new pieces. The ceiling panels are not square. I repeat they are not
square. Even after I used original panels for my templates I swore that
I did something wrong. Putting them in was a bitch. I swore they were
going to crack as I bent and curled them. But in the end they popped
into  place with a perfect fit. The driver side panel I made from 2
pieces with the rear seam mostly hidden by the z-bed. The trickiest
parts to make were the rear corners.I could not find thinner birch large
enough to  easily bend to fit the curve. Instead I used the same 1/8 in
wood and thinned about 2/3 of the backside with a sander so it would
bend without breaking. Worked like a charm. Well wourth the effort.
