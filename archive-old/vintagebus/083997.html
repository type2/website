Another  annoyance (for me as a new splittie-owner) is the windshield
wipers...they  do not wipe through my line of sight.  The arms look quire
stubby and  maybe they have been replaced with a substitute in the past, and
the upper  quarter of the windscreen isn't getting swept, which is a good
couple of  inches below my line of sight :(  The blades can't be any longer
with  the current geometry...is this  normal?

Regards,

Drew



Its not uncommon to find beetle wiper arms and blades have been put on to  
splitties. 67 only wiper arm bases are a little longer.  Mike
