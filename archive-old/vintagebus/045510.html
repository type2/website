actually, when the bus and truck bumpers were different, they did have 
different part numbers.   used the same bumper from what mid 1960 on.

 Hi Kyle,
 Yes, but what happens when you install the wrong bumper?  Does the bus/truck 
 fall off of tall cliffs?  Since rims are alot more important to keeping the 
 VW on the road and not suddenly off of it the parts book would have shown it 
 if there was a problem of this magnitude.  Thusly if the crow foot rims was 
 to be a significant reinforcement for trucks and panels only....  Plus so 
far 
 we only have been able to find one non-crow foot rim dated before 1960.  
This 
 would mean that we only can find truck or panel rims?  When more kombis, 
 westies, deluxes were imported to the USA?  Eric&amp;Barb
