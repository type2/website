Subject: '59 Kombi...safari rubber experiment

Today I stopped by the junkyard and grabbed some rubber off of a few 
early 90's mini-vans. My intent is to replace the aftermarket rubber 
I've got that never fit...leaving huge gaps at the corners where it 
didn't even get to the window lip.

I picked up 3 different types so I could experiment and see what fits 
best. all of them have a big squishy hollow tube that's used to make 
the seal. I see these all over mini-vans and...to me...they look 
exactly like what we need for safari's. The gushy rubber sticks out 
more and therefore touches the window at all places. the fact that it 
can be compressed easily and a lot makes it really seal well.

I'll follow-up on how it all works out. The main problem is that I 
didn't pay attention what I pulled them off of or what part of the 
vans. So after I figure what works best, I'll post very detailed 
pictures of the rubber and how it looks installed.

I've got one in right now and can say without a doub t that it will 
for sure work better than what was there.

I paid $5 for 4 big strips that do just about both windows each. If 
things go the way the look like they should, we may have a  better 
way to seal those darn things.

Optimal perfermance would be gained if I would have had the seals 
when I installed the windows. Since I didn't install the little 
adjustment plate like factory safari's have, mine are &quot;set in stone&quot;.

Other minor problem is that the round corners are not molded. But 
because of the squishy affect, it doesn't seem to be that big of a 
deal.

more later......
