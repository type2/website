Hello

Thanx for the quick answers everybody

The fault didn't came right after ajusting the cable, so I think I have a
leak :-(

I'm looking and might came back

Thanx again

Ciao

	Wouldn't hurt to look for oil hanging out at the base of the bell
	housing, or at the very front of the bottom of the engine (front is
	towards the front of the vehicle).  If you've got appreciable oil
	there, and it's not obviously coming from farther back on the
engine,
	then you've probably got a leak you'll need to deal with.  But
playing
	with the cable adjust is by far the easier first step.
