Your Baja trip is one of my favorite stories from the list, and the shift
coupler situation just makes it better. I owe you beer, still haven't
forgotten &quot;Janesville Grey&quot; right?
By the Way...if you can make it through Baja, certainly we should see you
next year in Missouri, right?

&gt; I did 4000 miles with a hose clamp for a shift coupler when I blew mine
&gt; in Guadalajara.
&gt;
&gt; But then, I had no other option..... :)
