I've used the Jupiter tires for nearly 10 years on our Campmobiles.
Excellent combination of price, performance, load rating, and durability.
In the West and Northwest USA they are sold by the Les Schwab chain.

The M+S branded/rated passenger versions are identical to the
Reinforced/C/D/6-ply/8-ply rated tires, except for the heavier construction.
I've had a good relationship with a local Les Schwab store for 15+ years,
and at my request the management has attempted to document the M+S
characteristics of the Reinforced versions.  All the factory paperwork Les
Schwab gets for/with these Reinforced tires states they are, in fact, M+S
tires.  Unfortunately, this is not branded/molded into the tire sidewalls.

M+S on the sidewall is the ONLY &quot;documentation&quot; acceptable to the Washington
State Patrol.  Never mind that in snow and slop your Jupiter-shod bus can
motor right past most other vehicles with &quot;official&quot; M+S tires [including
some WSP cruisers - poor drivers, perhaps?].  If the pass/mountain is
posted, no M+S on the sidewall means a very expensive ticket.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Jupiter and Merit are both &quot;house brands&quot; of Hercules tires.  They are
good tires, available in the proper 185R14 size in load range C or D.  When
I last checked, the C and D tires were not M+S rated, while the
passenger-load tire was.  Same tread pattern too.  It's been a couple of
years, so they might have gotten around to having them certified in the
higher load range.  &lt;&lt;
