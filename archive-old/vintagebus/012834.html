&gt;&gt;A friend of mine and I were talking about how we wanted to build a fast VW,
and thought of something. Is it possible to unhook the fan and
  alternator/generator and run an electric fan? This is for entertainment
  purposes only, :) Don't like the idea of race car engines and 5,000 mile
  rebuilds. But just wondering if its the VW cooling system that works only or

  if you could add a totally different one. Thanks.

Brad, it takes about 7 hp to push a stock fan at highway speeds I believe --
so if you are driving a car with this setup in a &quot;regular&quot; way, i.e. no
special short burst uses like a dragster, you might do better with a stock
type setup as getting a motor that size and considering the electrical losses
converting from rotational energy to electrical energy back to rotational
energy and the fact that it would be spinning unnecessarily fast at idle and
--- AAAAARRRRRRRGH!  What a mess!!!!!  Simplify your life!  Drive a stock bus!
 (Brad, I'm always thinking about neat stuff like that, too!  I just know this
one is, well, something else..)  To answer your question though, yes, of
course you could use this rig, and it would work, too.  Read Mr. Hoovers bits
on engine cooling for additional insight on all of this.  He's done
experiments on cooling that haven't been published anywhere else.  Guaranteed
to inform!
