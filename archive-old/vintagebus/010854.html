I agree that the Classic seemed to have less energy than the
OCTO meet for some reason.  The Classic had a great turn-out
but maybe because all the VW models were there it lacked the
unity of the OCTO meet.  At the Classic even the buses were broken
up for the special display area, the buses in the show, and some
of the club areas, etc.

I think the weekend should be renamed to the NEATO / OCTO weekend
and the Classic should be the secondary event :)
