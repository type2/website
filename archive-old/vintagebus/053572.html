Subject: Re: [VB] Headlight Bucket Rebuilding

I think I know exactly what you are talking about.
Your talking about the kind that has a sorta arrow
that threads onto the adjuster, and the arrow part
goes through a piece of rubber that is attached to the
bucket, and the rubber dries up. There is hope, there
is a different style of bucket that doesn't use the
rubber pieces that dry up and stop working properly.
There is a bucket that has a wire rod/spring that does
all the adjusting. I tried finding a picture of one to
send you, but I couldn't find one, sorry.  
 Good luck
  Mike

&gt; I finally got around to doing something about the
&gt; headlight buckets on my
&gt; '67 last weekend.    I took it apart and realized
&gt; why one keeps looking for
&gt; worms and the other just wanders off to one side;
&gt; most of the &quot;doo-dads&quot;
&gt; that are used to adjust the lamp are shot or in
&gt; pretty bad shape.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the adjusting screw head is striped, the
&gt; spacers that fit on either
&gt; side of the adjusting screws fell apart when I
&gt; touched them, and there
&gt; appears to be be some additional hard plastic/rubber
&gt; pieces that the lamp
&gt; assembly pivots upon that are either missing or are
&gt; in various stages of
&gt; falling apart.
&gt; 
&gt; I have gone out looking for these parts (I would
&gt; think that I am not the
&gt; only one to have this need after about 35 years of
&gt; wear and tear) and have
&gt; had very little luck finding anything in parts
&gt; catalogs I have around the
&gt; house or online.
&gt; 
&gt; I am beginning to think that I may need to Mc Guiver
&gt; a solution.
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, has anybody had any luck in finding
&gt; these parts in either a
&gt; 'misc doo-dad rebuild kit for headlight buckets' or
&gt; as individual
&gt; components??
&gt; 
&gt; If you cant point me to a parts source, I would be
&gt; interested in your Mc
&gt; Guiver approach.  I know I can always go to a
&gt; hardware store and find the
&gt; screws, but I am interested in what you used to
&gt; might have used for that
&gt; plastic pivot piece and possibly the retaining clips
&gt; (mine are in pretty bad
&gt; shape but I can probably get away with what I have).
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks a million times in advance!!
