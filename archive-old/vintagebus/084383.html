&gt; My '87 16v GTI ran at 250F a lot during the AZ summer according to factory

I had an 89 16v GTI. I could hit 240 on a hot day hill climbing, but
I'm sure not as hot as AZ. But I also measured 178 psi compression
test on that motor. Just read quite a few web sites last night on
compression ratios, and they indicate higher CR means higher temps.

&gt; So assuming I understood everything correctly, unless you have a point on
&gt; your engine where the oil is hitting 440F (maybe head temp?), the oil is
not
&gt; breaking down.  440F is a pretty high head temp.

Actually the conventional wisdom I have heard is that as the oil gets
older, it breaks down to it's lowest number, meaning that you can't
procrastinate oil changes on multi grade oils. This has been borne out
in the 62 panel I took to BBB IX. At that time I was running right on
10 psi per 1000 rpm. Now I am overdue for the oil change, and today I
ran about 28 psi at 3200 rpm.
