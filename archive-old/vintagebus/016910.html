:  How about that blue wire, should it be going through the fuse box?

Just about the only thing that isn't fused is the starter.  There is a
separate fuse for each headlight, 8 amps each (can't remember if high
and low beams go through the same fuse or not.  Probably not).  As you
are discovering, there's a reason for there to be fuses - they're much
cheaper and easier to replace than wiring harnesses.

Sounds like some PO put in a random headlight that pulls more than 8
amps, and rather than do the right thing, hacked around it by
bypassing the fuse.  Much like putting a penny in a house fuse box in
concept.

Go to the diagrams section of www.type2_dot_com, find the diagram for your
particular bus, and rewire things the way they should be.
