VW Gods--
       I've had many a run in with &quot;VW Gods&quot; in my 25+ years of living and breathing VW's.  I once called Gene Berg for some daul carb linkage and got a 10 minute  lecture on lubercating said linkage and that if I had followed the manufactors instructions the linkage would have lasted a lifetime.  Not being able to get a word in edgewise the whole time.  Once Mr. Berg ran out of breath, I informed him that I bought the carbs and linkage used and the linkage was shot when I got it, and &quot; that if I had wanted a lecture I could have pissed off my wife and saved the phone charges and for all I care you can blank off!&quot; I then called Scat and was helped by a very helpful saleperson and had my linkage in 3 days.  We were all newbies at one time.  We all started from stupid and worked our way up.  Remember the your first valve adjustment (scary huh?).  No VW God is perfect and they all make mistakes, B. Hoover has yet to discover weld thur primer, G. Berg had lousy phone manners.  The main thing is, no one knows it all and never will!  That's what I love about VW's, to this day I discover and learn new and intersting things.  I bought a Type IV awhile back, the learning continues!  Always get a second opion, and if they tell you to get a Toyota, look for a 3rd!
     Insane Women- I love them!  In fact I married one!  Though I passed my insanity on to her, for when we met she was driving, UGH! a Citation.  But she soon learned to pitch in and was up to her elbows in VW grease before she knew it.  I feel safe knowing that if the wife breaks down she can put her car (she now drives the 412 daily) back on the road.  Learning is learning.  There is no difference in mechanical ability between men and women. Though I do find that women tend to smell better.
      Camp Stool-While bumming around the local recycling center (a great place for VW parts) I stumbled across a camp stool.  I know it's not Wesite.  It  has removeable legs. The legs are attached in pairs, they slid into a slot in the bottom of the stool.  This stool fits very nicely between my front seats, both my Splittie and my BayWindow.  Any ideas??
Peace, Love, and  Tolerance is the key to true Volksness,
