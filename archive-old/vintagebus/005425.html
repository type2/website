Subject: Re: [VB] 1300 cc power options

1300??
It should be a 1500.....originally.

&gt;i have currently purchased a 67 kombi and wanted to know what are the best and
most feasible options for increasing the power of the existing 1300cc
engine....by feasible, i mean without spending a ton of money....

&gt;i was told to put 87mm big bore pistons in it, that they will fit....how much
work does this entail? is it a bolt on installation or will it include taking it
to shops and special tool purchases....?
