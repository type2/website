1.   call the shop and complain they didn't tighten the plugs.   Make them 
fix it. Or at least clean up the mess

2. actually, this is why I do my own work, cause I have had shops not fix 
things (and charge me).  usually I get it right.

3.  check the oil in the center section too, it is connected to the RGBoxes, 
and if it was leaking out the box, could be low in the middle,  Ya check all 
the drain/fill plugs.

4.  sealer I never used on the plugs, and never had it leak out of the 
drain/fill plugs.   You don't need to torque them real hard, what like 18ft 
lbs.
