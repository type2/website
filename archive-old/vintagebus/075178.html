Subject: Advice

I am, sadly, preparing myself mentally to sell my 1962 15-window deluxe but 
am uncertain as to a fair price to ask. It is in need of restoration. It has 
a small amount of through rust on the floor by the cargo doors (garaged 
since I picked it up). It is a walk thru with the correct rear seat but 
later year middle with the correct hold downs. I have deluxe bumpers (round 
unfortunately), nearly all the glass plus one extra corner (missing rear 
window and one wing), rims and jail bars. It has the transaxle (one 
reduction is bad, bearing) and an engine of unknown condition. California 
registered but on inactive status.

I realize pricing is based entirely on what the market will bear but any 
constructive thoughts are appreciated?

Staffan
