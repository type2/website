Subject: RE: [VB] Overriders - Not Overriders

Ya, all US spec buses 59 -67 came with overriders and uprights.  It is part of the N. Am spec code, if not spelled out as 175 on the tag.

People lose bumpers, and overrriders get bent and left off.  
You too, can make a list of things done wrong or forgotten, and be called an anal retentive vintage nazi for it.  

Then again, you can have a very original bus, that has been through the years and has a few losses and/or changes, but is still 95% original, even if the back bumper lost its overriders.

Dunno what the deal with chrome bumpers is.  I think that actually might have been a factory option.   I have a chromed front slash blade w/ overrider and uprights, it may go on my crusty truck, then again I may hock it if someone wants it.   Might prefer to get or make some hurky jungle bumper for the truck.

 Or the &quot;factory&quot; stock ones that are chrome with delux trims.

&gt; What is the deal with overriders on DC's and SC's?
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen pictures of &quot;unrestored&quot; and &quot;original&quot;
&gt; trucks, some have
&gt; overriders front and back, some have them on front
&gt; and not on back, etc, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Were they originally sold with an overrider as an
&gt; option?
