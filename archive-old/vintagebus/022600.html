&gt;The steps as I see it:
&gt;
&gt;Stripping out.  I can do this.  I have done it before and figure 2-3 weeks
&gt;part-time.

Why do you feel you have to strip it out?  You can replace the rockers and
front floors with just about everything in the bus.  If you're in a pinch
for space and time, this is the way to go.  Replace the rockers now, and
maybe the front floors, but unless the cargo floor is absolutely gone,
leave it be for now.

Get it roadable first.  Doesn't sound like you're set up at this time to do
a real resto.

&gt;Engine - The original engine is in the bus.  Rebuilt how many times?  I
&gt;dunno!  Rebuildable?  same answer.  I can certainly handle a standard
&gt;rebuild but I worry about restoration... with a bus of this vintage, I

Go get a rebuilt long block and swap it in.  It can be done within a
weekend, if you don't dawdle.  I've done it from drive-into-the-garage to
test-drive in a single day.  Don't get all anal about &quot;same year block&quot; at
this point

&gt;Other mechanicals... a mystery 'til I get a look under the bus.  As I said
&gt;above, there is nothing beyond my capabilities, tho there are some &quot;bits&quot;
&gt;(master cylinder, etc.) that have me a bit scared on availability.

Don't even mess around here: bite the bullet and buy new brake h/w - lines,
shoes, M/C (sell the house?) and wheel cylinders.  Just do it once and get
it over with.  I also recommend buying the wheel bearings from some place
that will take them back if you don't use 'em, just so you have 'em on
hand.  I'll bet ya a bagel you'll need 'em.

Do the tranny fluid too.  And a clutch and throttle cable while you have the
engine out.

&gt;I thought that the &quot;M-code&quot; plate was located behind the driver's seat...
&gt;looked and saw none.  saw no paint marks, tho that would have indicated
&gt;removal, nor rivet holes.

Look harder - it hsould be there.

&gt;Replacement glass...  Problem?  are good used pieces available or are we
&gt;talking aftermarket-only at a reasonable price?

The aftermarket onces are pricey; a local glass shop should be able to help
you out and cut some for ya.  I might have a spare set if it comes down to
that.

&gt;Other than the Master cylinder and turn signal box, what are the '67 only
&gt;parts?

Wiper motor.

&gt;I don't think this is the deluxe interior... bed/seat in the back and
&gt;seat/cooler cabinet behind the divider with a flip up table between.
&gt;&quot;Spice rack&quot; on the rear double door, tho.  What is it?  SO-wise?

67-only SO-L
