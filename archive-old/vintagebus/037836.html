&gt;If you had &quot;paid&quot; yourself a labor rate commensurate with your experience, I imagine you'd have a lot more invested ;)
&gt; 
I hate it when people do that, like the guy that had a late 50s single cab for sale for $22k but had over $40k invested because he did all the body work.  He was a professional body person who made $30/hr (or maybe it was $40/hr)  I think invested means you outlayed either the $$$$ or you bartered that much, not personal labor.

Otherwise, I calculate I have about $60k into my web site.
