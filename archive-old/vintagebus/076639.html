Subject: Re: [VB] For your info and some questions (a bit long)

Mistakes can happen....

I had a '66 Deluxe that the factory letter said was originally shipped to
Hawaii. Despite the fact it was a European Tourist delivery picked up in
Norway and driven around Europe before being shipped to Canada. I had some
of the bills from the original owner to prove this......... A bit of a
difference......

'67 Westy
'53 Kombi

&gt; However when I wrote to Volkswagen asking about production history of the
car
&gt; their records show a production date
&gt; of 6 February 1963. The delivery date is 11 February 1963 with the point
of
&gt; delivery shown as Portland, Ore. USA
&gt; The difference in those two production dates is confusing to me.
