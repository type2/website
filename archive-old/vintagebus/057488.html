Subject: Converting Tank Size

How do I put a Bay window gas tank into my 1959 double
cab?  This would give me more distance on trips, plus
I can add a fuel gauge without complications.  Any
experience on the list?

My early bay tank holds just a skosh over 15 gallons.

&gt; Anyone know what size tank is standard equipment in
a '58 single cab? 
The PO of mine said he put in a larger tank and I was
thinking Bay 
tanks were 15 gallons.  I ran out of gas the other day
and when I filled up 
I only could put in 15.  Didn't put in that much from
the gas can.  
Anyone know?
