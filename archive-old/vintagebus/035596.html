 &lt;&lt; Anyway the problem is there needs to be a square peg (I think) coming out 
 of the 
  left handle assembly so that the handle can mount then get screwed to the 
 assembly. &gt;&gt;
 Hi Steve &amp; Rachelle,
 If you are talking about the forward cargo door on the passenger side of the 
 bus then you have a non-walk thru exterior panel van handle.  Either you 
need 
 to get a non-panel handle or talk to Gabriel who runs a VW key buiness for 
 the adapter piece he has created for these.  Eric&amp;Barb
 
  &gt;&gt;

I have found adaptors in 60's panel van that were made into campers 
(riviera?)  they were a square peg with a round hole and a longer screw.
