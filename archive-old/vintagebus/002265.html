Subject: Air-Cooling of Oil and Heads

This sorta relates to Sam Gingold's recent post re:  kooling.

I have a question about the external oil-cooler idea.  Bernie Bergman has a
system that uses a thermostat to control a valve and a switch.  This system
apparently retains the use of the stock oil cooler as well.

At warm-up, oil is routed from the pump to the external filter and
back...when temps hit 180, the valve opens, and oil is routed through the
external cooler.  And then, when temps reach 190, the switch triggers an
electric fan which moves heat-laden air away from the external cooler.  This
was my idea, by the way... ; )

Any experience or thoughts about these systems?  I know there are those who
attest that a properly maintained VW  won't overheat, but when you sit in
traffic, your heads are cool (the forced air cools heads nicely), but the
oil always seems to get hotter....more hotter than I'd like, anyway!  Also,
when travelling in rarefied air, there is less of that air there to conduct
heat away from your engine.  Airplanes have to adjust prop pitch and speed
for altitude, why should we think that our air-cooled engines don't have
similar issues?

Now I'll really go sleep....

Gene
