&gt; My question is this:  can I just use a rattle can of paint for the
&gt; finish coat, or do I have to spend the 42 bucks and get POR15's
&gt; finish paint?

If you spray a very light coat of primer over the POR when it is
tacky, you will have a proper base for using your finish paint.
When the POR has cured, you can add more primer or do your finish paint.
You don't need the POR TOP-COAT. THey now have an interface product that
goes on when the POR is dry - no tacky feather-coating needed. It's called
TIE COAT. You can paint over that.  So there you have two options.
