Subject: welding and various bits

Hey all, a lot has gone on since I last posted...  I moved to another
city and got my own shop now! woo hoo! well..not my own..a few buddies
and I rent it.  Woody knows of this shop...Billy... there is a 58 kombi,
a 59 single cab (for sale), a 63 standard (mine), and a 74 standard
there.  Stella the 71 pops up every now and then just to say hi.
Anyways...  Now that the 63 is in the shop I cleaned out all the seats
and stuff that were in it and cleaned up the cargo floor and primed and
painted it...except where it needs welding.  The bus needs both rockers,
and an inner rocker (or strengthening) on the cargo door side.  The
latch piece is gone and replaced with some cheesy bolted down sheet
metal.... so I need that whole area reconstructed.  I need about 6&quot; from
the outside in, and the length from door end to door end.  Anybody make
this section? Thom, do you still have that piece for me??  and where the
bulkead meets the floor..that part is cheesy too.  I need about 3&quot; back
from the bulkhead.  Anybody make that?  I could also use a piece for
along the drivers side wall...about 4&quot; in from the wall....all cargo
floor pieces.  Does anybody make these pieces???  Suprisingly
enough...the frame is perfect.  It even shows through on some of the
rusted out cargo floors and has just light pitting.  I plan on using a
MIG welder for the whole operation...

Any insight?

Thom...why did you ever cut up that hoopty parts bus? It ran..it
drove..thats what counts ;-)  We here Wescaaansanites (best said with a
Wisconsin accent) would love to drive something like that.

anyone have any spare metal lying around that they never used?  who is
best to get metal through?  I plan on making a large (wiring harness and
all seals) order from Wolfsburg West rather soon...do they have it? is
it any good?  Of course I may just end up using stainless like I hope to
do for the rockers 8)

Anyone ever seen John Lago's bus? The 62 i think it is...  The &quot;most
modified at BBTA&quot; I live a couple blocks away from him and he is coming
over to the shop soon to see what we can do about the welding.  I like
his stainless work!

to all who are awaiting stuff from me (bus stuff) I just settled in to
my new home, and am currently looking for a job.  Weather sucked today
(lotsa snow!) so I did not get a chance to go anywhere and ship stuff.
Sorry, but it will be done VERY soon.  Its been hectic.
