Subject: Re: Rear Bumper &quot;Hole&quot; for Westy Tent

&gt;&gt;From all of the campers I've looked at, I've come to the conclusion that
&gt;there is no one correct spot. I really think it was left up to whoever was
&gt;drilling bumper holes that day.

I think that's probably right.  The pic at http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/pitch/p_erect.html (see &quot;Point C&quot;) is probably the closest thing to a spec I've seen.  
You want to be able to reach the 'nut' on the back.  The upright pole from the bumper to the side frame can be adjusted to fine-tune the length.  I used to have one 
of these tents mounted on a 68 Westy and it worked fine even mounted to that.
