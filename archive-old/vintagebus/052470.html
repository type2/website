Subject: Re: [VB] power converters


S,

I have the Airtop 2000 (gasoline version), as I mentioned below.  I mounted 
it underneath the rear seat/bed.  I ran the exhaust out through one existing 
heater channel and use the remaining stock ductwork to translate the heat 
through the cabin and to the windshield.

Hope this helps,

R

So which model Webaster do you have in the Samba?  And where did you mount 
it?

&gt;
&gt;For heat, I use a Webasto AirTop 2000 gas-fired heater in my 66 Samba. The
&gt;unit is about half the size of a loaf of bread (wheat or white!) and
&gt;produces more heat than I an can use at a VERY low amp cost - even when
&gt;first firing up.  I use it as a constant heat source when camping in the
&gt;winter, and it keeps us quite comfortable all night.  You can get the
&gt;specifics on the system at
&gt;
&gt;http://www.webasto-thermo_dot_com/
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I'll give you the basic specs below.  You need to order the gas model
&gt;special, and be prepared for quite a hit to the pocket book.  Unit and
&gt;installation kit run about $1500, but I think it is well worth the money 
&gt;for
&gt;both safety (to see driving, heat when stranded, lots of failsafes in the
&gt;unit) and comfort (real toasty!).
&gt;
&gt;Good luck,

&gt;Casey,
&gt;How much of a strain?
&gt;WAY TOO MUCH.
&gt;The biggest VW alternator that I have seen provides 75 amps.
&gt;That is right around 1000 watts
&gt;1500 watts would require an alternator capable of providing in excess of
&gt;125 amps
&gt;With headlights, you are going to need 30-40 amps to just drive the
&gt;vehicle.
&gt;Add stereo and you're really pushing it.
&gt;You're up to at least a 200 watt alternator.
&gt;
&gt;FYI  Watts = Amps x Volts
&gt;Also, for a long life out of electrical gear, it is best to keep their
&gt;sustained load at or below 80% of their rated value.  (In many places
&gt;that 80% figure is mandated by code).  Leave that extra 20% to handle the
&gt;load peaks.
&gt;
&gt;You may notice that many devices are now being rated at XXX Continuous
&gt;and YYY peak
&gt;1. XXX is putting that 80% value in writing
&gt;2. YYY is peak and many times has a time limit associated with it.
&gt;I have seen equipment burnt to a crisp where it has been continuously run
&gt;just below peak (98%)
&gt;
&gt;This is one of those seasonal topics that hit every year about this
&gt;time.  The colder winter we get, the more inquiries hit the list.
&gt;Electric heating has been beat to death and then some here on the list,
&gt;you might want to browse through the archives for more ideas.
&gt;
&gt;Keep an eye on ebay for a gas heater.  I've heard them called Nuclear
&gt;Sausages and from my experience, they are well worth the name.

&gt; &gt; hi all. you know those 12v to 110 power converters?
&gt; &gt; well, here's my idea. i have a space heater at home
&gt; &gt; that needs 1500 watts to run and it heats my 20 x 14
&gt; &gt; room in about 20 minutes. my current power converter
&gt; &gt; cannot not power this beast. so iwas thinking of
&gt; &gt; getting a power converter that could put out 1500
&gt; &gt; watts. now my question is, will that put too much
&gt; &gt; strain on the battery/generator? would i have to go
&gt; &gt; for an alternator at that point? and if so, what is
&gt; &gt; the cutoff point for what a generator can handle
&gt; &gt; safely? thanks for all your help.
