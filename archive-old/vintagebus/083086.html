Subject: engine install

Hello,
I am attempting to install a 1600 into a '60 DC.  I had it in, however the
starter bolt was not through, and I can not get to it, so I removed the
engine to try again.
Upon the re-install, I did not have the transmission shaft aligned properly
into the pressure plate.  This particular plate has like 9 or 10 &quot;nubs&quot; and
the 3 spring loaded &quot;clamps&quot; on the round....
Anyway, I tweaked the round circle and springs on the clutch side.  They
were whopper jawed... I noticed some slots on the &quot;springs&quot; and got
everything lined up...

I believe I have everything in order, but now the motor will not go in.  It
gets 90% or so...

Any suggestions?  Did I damage the pressure plate?

Make it a Great Day!!
