My '66 came with the yellow/orange and blue tent with striped awning,
internal skeleton and no floor. It came in an orange (yellowish orange) bag,
with a blue tent pole bag. The stakes and ropes are in a white, red and blue
striped bag with a flap that snaps shut.
The tent connects to the bus with a yellow/orange flap connecting to the bus
via rubber rib that fits into metal channel above cargo doors on bus.

&gt; Correct me if im wrong but i thought that 65-67 tents WERE drive away and
&gt; featured a floor.
&gt; Main difference being internal skeleton.

&gt; &gt; Westfalia never offered a floor until 65 I believe.
&gt; &gt; Ask todd s. about that one.
&gt; &gt; Todd, where are you?
&gt;
&gt; AFAIK the first Westy tent with a floor was the &quot;Add-a-Room&quot; or
&gt; &quot;Drive-Away&quot; tent offered for the '68 models.  That tent was also the
&gt; first Westy tent (since at least mid-50's) with an external frame.  In
&gt; fact the two features are probably related.
