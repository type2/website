Just wondering about gas mileage.
On average,is roughly 80-100 miles per tank of gas pretty normal?
I don't fill right up because of that &quot;fill it up too high leaking problem&quot;
but I'd say the tank is about 7/8ths full.
Not hi-way miles, just in town back and forth to work and all that.

Wanted to see if I fall
within the average.
