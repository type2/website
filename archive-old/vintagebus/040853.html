Those look a lot like the mirrors on my '64 truck.  However it's not a
VW truck, it's a Ford.  I have an set of these in the box for use
on my truck, I think they are still available at NAPA.

The bolt goes though a flat metal bar that sticks up from the door.

A friend of my dad's had those mirrors on his 64 camper.  That had to be
20+ years ago.  Kind of a funky camper as I remember, definitely not any
of the common conversions.  I seem to remember them having a really
skinny post on them too, even thinner than OE ones.
