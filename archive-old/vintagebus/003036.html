I believe also the narrow/one way Euro streets and alleys made them more
desirable.

&gt; there were alot more commercial vehicles, as the us had that import tax
&gt; against commercial vehicles
&gt;
&gt; compared to the euro/brits buses, the N AM buses are all pretty standard.
&gt; Many many many more options there.   Probably was easier (cheaper?
quicker?)
&gt; to get custom orders.  .....
