Subject: Rear end swap - '54 Single Cab.

Through a coincidence, I have met someone who is looking for a pair of long
axles for their lowered Bus to exchange for a set of big-nut '66
axles/brakes/etc..  On my '54 Single Cab, which has a Bug tranny and rear
end conversion done by the PO, I just happen to have these items.  I would
prefer to return to the stock reduction box configuration so I wish to do
the swap.  The Bug rear end in there is of the small-nut variety.

Because I still have the complete Barndoor front-end, do I need to be
concerned with the brakes/axles/etc. I use in the rear?  I assume the '66
big-nut brakes are larger.  Will this be problematic?  I know I must change
spring plates as well since the Barndoor ones are still on there.

Also, given a similar year, say '65, does the Bug transmission nose cone
mount differently than a Bus one?  The Single Cab has a custom made mount
for the Bug nosecone (luckily the split-case mount is still fully intact in
I ever go that route).

Thank you.
