Of course, it is a Sapphire IX.

Thanks!!

&gt; Hi Bob,
&gt; It would vastly help to know which make and model of radio you are trying
to
&gt; install!
&gt; Eric&amp;Barb

I am trying to install my original radio in my 67 std bus.  I have the
radio, the mounting plate that is attached to the inside of the dash, and
the outer faceplate, knobs, etc.  What I don't seem to have are the nuts
that attach the radio to the mounting plate.  The way things line up, it
appears the nuts would need to be L shaped, so there is a recessed part of
the nut that protrudes into the mounting plate and grabs the threads on the
radio shafts.  I say this because the threaded portion of the shafts does
not extend beyond the mounting bracket.  Am I correct??  If so, does anyone
have, or know where I can buy a pair of these nuts??  Or am I the nut?

Thanks!!

Bob T
