&gt;Dizzy on workbench I would swear they are at 0.016. Dizzy in car, 
&gt;the little digital dwell / tach thing says right about 0.42. Did
&gt;it again with identical results.

The feeler gauge is in inches but the meter is usually in degrees.
The 0.016 inches is designed to get you in the right &quot;ballpark&quot; to
start with.  The goal is 50 degrees dwell.  It sounds like your meter
is telling you you have 42 degrees dwell which indicates you are pretty
close.  Dwell is the amount of time the points are closed, so if you
need more dwell, it means the points have to spend more time closed,
and therefore need to be closer together.  Try an 0.014 feeler gauge
and see how that measures out.  I haven't set the dwell in my Bus
enough times on this distributor to have a good number, but on my
dad's Bug, somewhere between 0.012 and 0.014 usually ends up giving
me 50 degrees dwell.

&gt;I have one of those VDO tachometers. So maybe my bus isn't really high
&gt;tech free. I bought it a while back thinking it was important for
&gt;something, I forget exactly what. Today I find that while the digital
&gt;meter says I idle at about 850rpm, the VDO says 1200.

Make sure all tachometers involved have the right cylinder setting.
Your digital meter probably has a knob that you can set at 4-6-8;
the VDO probably has a switch or two on the back.

&gt;How fast can I drive my bus?

Clara had a good explanation - it mostly depends on the gearing you
have.  The overall ratio will be somewhere *around* 4:1 to 4.5:1.
I think the procedure for figuring this out goes like: shift into
4th gear, put the back of the Bus up on jack stands, and release the
parking brake.  With the key off, turn the engine with a wrench until
the timing mark is lined up - all you need is a point of reference.
Mark one of the rear tires at &quot;12 o'clock&quot; with chalk or tape.  Then
go back to the engine and start turning it over with the wrench,
counting revolutions and checking the mark on the tire periodically.
When the tire has made one complete revolution, stop turning the
engine - the number of turns you have made tells you the gear ratio.

A new, properly inflated 205/75R15 tire should make 744 revolutions 
in one mile (see http://www.type2_dot_com/library/tires/kabayo.html ).
If you want to cruise at 60 mph, this means those 744 revolutions
happen in one minute.  If your overall gear ratio is 4:1, 744
revolutions at the tire is (744*4) or 2976 revolutions at the
engine.  If your overall ratio is 4.5:1, 744 revolutions at the
tire is (744*4.5) or 3348 revolutions at the engine.  **IF**
(very BIG IF) your Bus is completely stock, your ratio &quot;should&quot;
end up somewhere around 4.26:1, which gives 3171 RPM at 60 MPH. 
Then all you have to decide is what RPM you want to run at and
you have your answer.

Good luck!
