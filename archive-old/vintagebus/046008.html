Hi Andy,
The problem is that in wetter weather these ring pads just get thier 
nuetralizing chemical washed off.  This is doubly so for the pads for under 
the battery.  Then they turn on you by holding water and acid in the area 
which just turns them into enemies of your VW.  Kind of like tonsils gone 
very bad!  Also these pads do not fit the cable ends that bolt directly to 
the starter.
  So when you do that twice a year maintainance use some water and baking 
soda to wipe down the outside and posts of your battery, but keep it away 
from the water filler areas.  You will kill your battery if you let baking 
soda inside the battery.  Then soak the individual battery clamps directly in 
a tin can with water and a couple of tablespoons baking soda solution in it.  
When you see this solution bubble it is cleaning out the acid!  This will do 
far more to keep the battery clamps and the battery itself clean longer than 
some cheap felt rings.  If you love your VW get a battery box to protect your 
VW sheet metal.  You can cut the boxes to only half the hieght of the battery 
and they still work thier magic.
