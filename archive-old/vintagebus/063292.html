&gt;thanks to john at aircooled_dot_net, i have a new toy to play with...
&gt;an air/fuel meter.

Shiny!  Toy toy toy.

&gt;fired it up and danged if the thing wouldn't come off of full rich. i 
&gt;had a 120 main, 55 idle and 135z emulsion in a german 30pict1 that
&gt;rimco had rebushed. dropped the main down to 117.5, and was able to
&gt;get highway speed under load to run at the 2nd or 3rd light off full
&gt;rich, which john says is around 11/1 mixture, and about right.

This is pretty cool, but keep in mind you will never be able to get
it dialed in under every possible condition.  You can shoot for a
good overall average though.

In the Bosch Automotive Handbook there is an interesting little chart
(p. 365 of the 4th edition).  It shows the differences in mixture
between cylinders for fuel injection vs. carburetion; I'm guessing
they are both on some reference engine.  The axes are RPM (1K-5K) and
load (0-100%).  Carburetors do best from about 1500 to 2000 RPM and
20% to 10% load...there is a 2.5% or less variance between the
cylinders.  Carbs suck at low speed and full load: at about 1500 RPM
and 100% load, the chart shows a possible 62% difference between
cylinders.  On the other hand, fuel injection does best at low speed
and full load: at about 2000 RPM and 100% load, the variance is 2.5%.
It doesn't do so well at part load and low speed: at 1500 RPM and 55%
load, the variance is a whopping 12.4%.

&gt;it idles pegged at full rich 90% of the time, and so i know i'm too
&gt;rich there. i suspect it is due to a vacuum leak, and i have the
&gt;mixture screw turned out too far to compensate.

The Brosol (Mexican) 30-PICT-1 on my Bus has a vacuum fitting on the
left side for the distributor.  If you're not using a vac advance
distributor, have you capped this line?
 
&gt;john suggests i spray starter fluid in the engine room &gt;while watching
&gt;the lights&lt; to see what area makes them change; that's a leak candidiate.

I used generic brake cleaner from the FLAPS as starting fluid on my
lawnmower a couple of weekends ago and it seemed to work well.  (The
choke was screwed up; I've since fixed it to not need the fluid.)  In
the Archives, Bob Hoover suggested using WD-40 to find carb leaks - he
claimed it was &quot;mostly kerosene&quot;.
