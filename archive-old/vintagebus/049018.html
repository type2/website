The rough spot on the #4 cyl was RUST! The rings held it to a 2&quot; patch with a little bit wicking up the rings. I've got more money than time, the shop is doing that job, cc'ing the heads and putting in proper barrel shims instead of the current stack of fiber and steel. So if you see my orange/yellow DC passing Karl's 77 green westy on the hills and him passing me on the flats between Fresno and Lake Havasu next week, uh, uh, uh, buy me a beer!

South Africa Meet? Take some pics and upload them to www.thesamba_dot_com, Switzerland and England are represented. Send some videotapes and we'll watch them at Jerome or BBBV! 

Cutting up a bus? What was that famous web site that had pictures (movies!) of a cadaver sectioned every 2 mm? Grey's Anatomy meets Mad's Don Martin (RIP, recently).
