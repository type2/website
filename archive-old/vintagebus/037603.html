&lt;&lt; I thinking of converting my non walkthru deluxe to a walkthru.&gt;&gt;
Hi Eric,
Unless you remove a walkthru section from another bus and weld it in place 
this is npot a good idea.  The bench seat and walkthrus bulkheads are 
designed to reinforce the front door pillars from flexing while driving 
normally and if hit in this area during an accident.  Best instead to find a 
walkthru you can buy and live happily ever after.

&lt;&lt;Just curious if I had 2 front benches could I use the 2 drivers seats to 
make two buckets  for a non walk thru?&gt;&gt;
You could design and alter almost anything as long as it is not too big.  
Heck you could even install a pair of 1970s banana bike seats for each side.
