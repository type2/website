&gt; I look at the dust cap on the outside of the drums.  If it has a nice easy
to
&gt; pry off with a claw hammer lip, then it is the 1 ton suspension (64-67).
If
&gt; it is smooth and therefore tricky to remove the  dust cap covering the
front
&gt; axle nuts, then it is 3/4 ton (63 and earlier)
**SNIP**
Well, here we go then. It's a later type I think since the dust caps were
very easy to remove. I'm not 100% though. I did manage to take the whole
drum, brake system, WC's apart and off for inspection. I'll need new ones.
The old ones are nothing but toast. Whoever sandblasted the bus didn't cover
untouchable parts good and sand is present everywhere. MC has been ordered
from Rocky Mountain already.

&gt; and why are these tie rods bent like that?
&gt; ======================
&gt;
 because someone bent them--oops, get new ones
**SNIP**
tie rods would have to go then. These look like this is the way it's
supposed to be though. Weird.


&gt;  is that e brake cable is rubbing on heater tube? Is it normal?
&gt; =======================
&gt; no- the cables are probably routed wrong.
**SNIP**
another mystery, cable guides look to be intact, the front though has been
replaced - I mean the entire cab has been welded in including the frame
except for the roof. This is a one screwed-up bus. I'm just uncovering more
and more problems everywhere I look. It's all bent out of shape, poor
quality blasting job left some areas not done at all and some over done,
welded-in front with poor very visible weld seams, engine in pieces, tranny
that I can't use for parts, half the bottom rusted out and seven 14&quot; wheels
out of which I'll be able to keep four.
Well?
