Subject: Re: [VB]installing a camper seat

I currently in the process of POR-15 ing my rear floor pan. Inorder to do so 
I have had to remove my interior cabinets, seats you name it. My question to 
the list is I ve noticed that I do not have the lateral screw hold downs. 
What size are these? Is this something that I can find at Home Depot? The 
side of the camper seat has holes in the base sides so that a Bolt wing nut 
can pass thru the closet and the left rear wheel area. You know I think I 
just answered my own question. Bolt, wing nut....
