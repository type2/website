Subject: N.A.D.A. Our Buses Value

   Just got back from MVD to register my 15 window and got the shock of my
life. N.A.D.A. recognizes the real value of our buses now. For those that
don't know N.A.D.A. is like kelley blue book and is what insurance
companies, dealers set the selling and insured values of our buses at.
According to NADA my 15 window is worth 6100 low and 14100 finished, my DC
4525 low and 11950 high, my DD panel 4300 low and 11150 high and my westy
5920 low and 14550 high. So it appears that the Westy camper is the most
valuable of all model buses. All these prices are for 1960 buses and the
book goes back to 1956. They value a 1956 Deluxe at 16400.  All these prices
come from a survey of what has sold, insurance companies , etc.
