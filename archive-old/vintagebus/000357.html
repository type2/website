&lt;&lt; Anyone have any tricks for seating the upper window frame into the door?  
I am having trouble getting the rubber mid seal to seperate so the frame can 
seat to the door. &gt;&gt;
Hi Matthew,
If something will not work try to go about it a differant way.  Put the seal 
loosely on top of the door.  Install the window frame down to about a couple 
of inches above being seated all the way down.  Reach under the seal, and 
window frame to push the seal onto the underside of the frame, and then lower 
seal, and window down (Get your fingers out of there!).  When the seal begins 
to push down onto the door top pull/pry the seal edges to get the seal onto 
the ribs of the sheet metal on top of the door.
