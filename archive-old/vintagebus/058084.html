Subject: Bought some bus parts....

Went to Abilene today and hung out with Jim Share and his baywindow buddy 
Ed M. They took me to a junkyard there with some old busses. Not much left 
on them, but I was able to score the rear-end parts off of a '69 for cheap 
enough. Their gonna be used on my 23-window project. What's great about 
this is that now I don't have to rob them off of that '69 bus I recently 
brought home. I had already stole the front balljoint beam, but replaced it 
with a '59 bus linkpin beam. Kinda looks cool sitting a few inches lower in 
the front and keeps the bus at least functional. So I'm gonna sell it here 
locally and get my money back. Glad I'm not relegating a fairly solid bus 
to parts status. I'll find it a good home and it'll be back on the road 
hopefully.
