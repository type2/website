John,

My 66 Crew cab has two factory looking lights in it.  One above where the
bulkhead is and one over the rear window, both mounted on the ceiling.  They
are both centered and look factory.  Lemme look...

I'm back.  I just removed both of them (since I was going to anyway.)  They
actually have immaculate pearl white paint underneath them, and some
authentic-looking patterns for three holes (2 for screws and one larger one
for the wire to pass through.)  It is the exact same on both of them.

&gt; This reminds me of something I've been wondering about. My crewcab has a
&gt; set of holes over the back window that are obviously mounting holes for
&gt; an interior light. Does anyone have a crewcab that has a light back
&gt; there that looks factory? I haven't seen all that many crewcabs, but
&gt; I've never seen one with a rear interior light.
