Subject: [VB] early bay seats in a 64 Kombi

There is a 64 Kombi in the area for sale sans the middle and rear seat. I
have two nice sets  of early bay seats. One set if from the 69 and the other
from the 72. Will these bolt up to the existing holes (ones made by VW not
by nature) in the cargo floor? Will the rear seat even fit in it or is the
splitty slightly narrower than a bay?

Chris
