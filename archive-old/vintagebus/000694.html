Pardon the blasphemous question here ;-), but has anyone come across any 
&quot;custom&quot; splits with cool/interesting paint schemes. I'm looking for ideas 
for my latest project. 

I'm not looking for anything grotesque or anything that glows in the dark, 
just something cool. Two or three tone combinations.

Now donning my flame retardant full body condom.........
