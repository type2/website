Subject: Re: [VB] Thom's new job

scott told me he wanted the t34 to serve as a &quot;date car.&quot;  i told him that a t34 was definitely a chick magnet as far as i was concerned.  well, if pictures are anything to go by i'd say that a t34 is also a thom-magnet1  my advice to thom and scott is that behavior like that while on a date is probably not the best idea.  acting silly and posturing like that is better saved until trust and respect has been established.  on the positive side, thom seems quite comfortable acting silly with us so must feel pretty trusting of us.  on the other hand, he also seems quite comfortable with extorting large sums of money from poor bus drivers!
