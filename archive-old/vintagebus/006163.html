As I understood it the calendar was applied post mortem to correspond with a
date of a blessed event to some of the more religious folks. Folks weren't
walking around using dates like 400 B. C., you know. At some point in the
ever so distant past it was determined that the calendar would count down
toward the special day and commence upward from there. So yes, the calendar
did begin at 0 and the year 1 began 365 days later, only the folks living in
the year 1 A.D. didn't necessarily know they were at the time. Anyway,
obligatory bus content. If you are counting up there in that weather, you
need to get a gas heater in that bus. One of your fingers fell off...8^)

&gt; figure that from day one of January 0001 till December 31, 2000 it was
2000
&gt; years even. We didn't start this calendar from year 0, we started from
&gt; number 1.
