::  i would like to share with youa story about a type
:: 3 and paint thinner filled water ballons(no joke) a guy just driving his notch
:: one day about the time when schools get out. and he was pelted with the paint
:: thinner filled water ballons.  it totaly ruined the paint.
It sounds as if the balloons had something more than paint thinner in
them 
-- lacquer thinner would soften and ruin lacquer coatings -- which the
type 3 might have had, especially on patches or resprays.  I think VW
used acrylic enamel in the '60s.
-- some type of paint stripper would clobber almost any paint, but
might not stay inside a balloon very long.
-- regular paint thinner might remove wax and make you polish your bus
(guess this is the type 2 content) but wouldn't do much damage unless
you soaked it for a very long time
-- brake fluid?
