I won't even attempt to demean you, Clara.  You are an icon
on this list and not many people know who I am.  But that's
OK.  I've tried to do the right thing for anyone that I've done
business with.  

I'll let the list in on the shot at me.

During the rebuild of my bus over the past two years, I've had
to do most of the parts buying from mail order, Bus Depot, Gene Berg,
CB Performance, Ronnie's Old Volks, and about a 1000 other people who
have provided a service to me.  I spent almost $18,000 so far and still
don't have headliner in.  I've replaced every piece of rubber on the 
bus, every line, every thing I could do, I did.  In 1994, my bus was
in bare metal, with no axels under it or windows in it.

I was 2800 miles away, on the east coast.  I did the entire bus by
phone and VISA.

I asked Ronnie to hand pick the bearings to find the best set 
possible.  It took him a couple of weeks but he did, and he gave me a
fair price and was paid immediately.  I had never met Ronnie but what
he had was fair.  He shipped them to the bus.

Bus Boys did my front beam, shocks, brake lines and a number of other
things as well, more than $1000, over the phone.

Rocky Mountain got about $700 for things associated with brakes, etc.

Rancho Performance got $1400 for trannie.

Ken Pike in Marysville, CA got $8600 for paint and assembly.

AVP in Sacramento got about $600 for engine assembly and balancing. Some 
guy they hired got $180 to rebuild my Kadrons.

I could go on and on but to the point.

In March of 99, I needed some brake leavers for emergency brakes 
because mine were gone.  I was in CA on business and to try to get
the bus on all 4s for the first time in over 6 years. I needed them
right Clara said she had some and would ship them overnight. And it was
a Saturday delivery. So I'm not sure what it would cost but probably
about $10 for overnight and another $10 for Saturday delivery.  Fair 
enough.  I had to leave on the Sunday from CA going back to AL.  I 
wanted to take the bus back with me.  Clara shipped them.  She charged
me $35 for the whole thing.  I guess that was fair enough.  I never got
them.  They weren't delivered on Saturday, I was there all day.  I had
to buy some from a guy here and ship them back to CA a month later. They
cost me about $6 for both and less than $3 to ship UPS.

My builder guy says they never came, and he never signed for them.  I'm
not saying Clara didn't send them, I don't know.  She probably did. I
didn't get them.  They are not on my bus.  They weren't in the shipping
lables or bills when we reconciled or in the spare parts I brought back
with the bus in August.

My wife had a little cancer scare just after the trip out to CA, and I 
had a heart attack.  My focus was on some different things other than 
finding a package that was 2800 miles away.

Clara, I'm sorry.  I guess karma is what you make it.
The check is in the mail

There is one guy I would like to plug and plug big.  Bob Nodvik
at I believe is The Wire Works, found on Thom's web page is one
great guy.  He stands by his product 100% even when we are the 
fools.  Three weeks ago, my parking light curcuit lit up like a 
Christmas tree.  Bob told me what to look for, told me how to keep
it from happening again, and sent me a replacement front harness,
no charge.  Of course, I sent him payment for the replacement, but
he didn't ask for it.

I hope the list understands.  I didn't mean to stiff anybody. Especially
someone like a Goddess.

Anyway, there it is.
