..some folks in this thread has been running quite hi
mph compared to RPM ratios in stock tranny
applications.  These readings seem all over the board.
I am wondering has anyone compare there speedo reading
to 'actual' speed via other means.  This maybe due to
using smaller then stock, radial tires in the place of
correct monsterous height bias plys?  

My speedo is dead on the nose correct with 6:40-15&quot;s
bias plys and is exactly 5 mph too fast with 195-75's.
 We have those neat little police set up MPH stands in
Ohio that warn you of your speed.  Cool for checking
out your actual bus speed!

My `61's rpms are 3600 _at_ 60mph with the bias ply
6:40-15's.  Exactly what my `61 brochure says it
should. With the 195-75 radials I run 3800 at 60 mph
(actual speed) and the speedo reads 65mph.

Never had problems with any overheating...run a 1600
sp with semi-hemi cut berg heads compression is 7:0-1
and use 93-94 octane.

Anyhow, with all the speed and rpm readings flying in
this thread I was curious on how 'correct' the
readings actual are.

&gt; my 67 with a 1600 dual port and extractors cruises
&gt; at 70+on flat ground at 
&gt; half throttle. Temp at &lt;210 in the summer, tach at
&gt; ~4100. WOT on flat sea 
&gt; level is 85+ at 4600+ and after 15 minutes, temp
&gt; rises to 230.
&gt; I usually shift at 4200 +/-
&gt; 30,000 miles on the rebuild (stock parts by
&gt; commercial rebuilder), I use Red 
&gt; Line 20W-50 synthetic oil and change at 3,000.
&gt; Works for me.
