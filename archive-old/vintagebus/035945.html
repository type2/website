Hi Volks,
For repair of enamel or lacquer one can apply touch up paint to small chipped 
areas with the fuzzy end of a paper match you just have ripped out of the 
matchbook.  These chips and scratches are another good reason to make sure to 
get more than enough paint not only to do the VW body, but to have some spare 
to do touch up later.  Eric&amp;Barb
