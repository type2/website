Man Thom, you shouldda come down to So Cal.  We went to the OCTO meet at
Transporter Gardens in Huntington Beach on Sunday.  Noting but busses.  There
had to be at least 50 of them there.  all kinds too, campers, deluxes,
barndoors, single cabs, double cabs, fire wagens, ladder trucks, coachbuilts,
all kindsa crazy stuff including a fancy schamncy spider contraption that had
a whole 64 singlecab shell strapped to it.  you could spin it around 360
degrees and reach almost any part of it.  I'll admit I had my ear ring in my
ear and I did see a few tattoos peeking out under shorts and shirt sleeves,
but all in all it was very nice.  For the most part you would have been very
impressed with the upper class HB appearance of the place and people there. 

The contertible barndoor was even there.  Complete with freshly added vent
trim (shiney reflective tape).  If me and Katie ever get married, we're going
to commission him to be our limo driver and cart us to and from the
church/recption in it.  Seems fitting for a member of the pierced/tattooed
generation of VW lovers these days

There was a VERY nice looking telefunken (sp?) radio there.  I think I
remember you saying you saw one at Kelly Park for $1500, well, you could have
bought 2 of the ones I saw on Sunday for $1500.

as far as your bus goes, We'll trade you a pair of barndoor cargo doors, that
Telefunken radio and a rusty 60 kombi for the 56, how's that sound?

Matt &amp; Katie
60 Kombi
