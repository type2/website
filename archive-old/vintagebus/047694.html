 &gt;&gt;STill haven't got the fronts off, guess it'll be a while.  I do have at
 least one extra curvy thing for the rear shock.  Did you rebuild or replace
 yours, and do you know about getting seals for the arm, cause after after I
 put them in  well I drove it around yeasterday morning and then it dripped
 from thearms jack oil plink plink on the garage floor POS.
 &gt;&gt;
 I have been told that the arm can be removed and the bushing replaced from a
 fellow Barndoor owner but have not seen it done with my own eyes or done it
 myself.  I personally have 2 replacement lever shocks to mount on my Bus.  I
 also have the 2 originals in perfect working order except the original owner
 cut off the arms midway.  Doh!
 ----------------------
do you remember who told you that?  I think I will need to do that.
..............
 I actually only need 2 of the curvy things...  I have 2.
 -------------
which side do you need?  I believe there are lefts and rights
..............
 &gt;&gt;
 re the change of part number systems I figured that they changed late 53 as
 my 6/53 made bus has the old style, while I have seen early 54s with the
 late style system.  So I am surprised you 55 has the 29.xx style.  go
 figure.
 &gt;&gt;
 I'll check my Bus out if there is interest, what parts should I look at?  I
 know the rear cargo door latch and the rear decklid latch have 29A #s.  The
 cargo door handle is 29A too.
 
 It wouldn't surprise me if some parts were overproduced and thus extended
 29A usage into early '55.

------------------
They changed the door keys for 54, does you cargo doors/engine lid T handle 
take the same key as the keys for 55 through 63?  Or the earlier smaller key? 
  I have this info from a VW key book.  hm, could you check on something that 
is not an easily replaced part?   how about the rear axles?   though those 
could have been,  and I dunno anything about the history of your bus.   Do 
your front doors have numbers stamped in them, i think at the side by the 
door hinges?
