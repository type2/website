&gt;The shocks were pretty easy.  I put on KYB GR-2s.  The old shocks were
totally worn out - I could compress them by hand and they would stay comp=
ressed.

Oil shocks compress easy.  If you try and move them in and out and there
is no resistance both ways, they are shot.  Or if they are leaking.

GR-2s are gas so they spring outward.  The cars I used GR-2s on always ha=
d
a worse ride than oil-filled.  Of course, I haven't used gas since I was
living large in a slammed Type 3, so ymmv.
