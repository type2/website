Just wondering.... what exactly would the ticket be for? No windshield, no eye
protection, being too cool?
 Here in TX Ive built a few off/on road buggies with no windshield, the only
requirement is it must have working windshield wipers..... go fig....
 Although wearing eye protection is highly recommended... whether driving with
no windshield, automobile or motorcycle... or just simply using the drill or
grinder in the shop.... I even use osha glasses with a hammer...

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; I was wondering how many of you out there drive with your safari's open and
&gt; have had run-ins with the law about it.  I'm in the SoCal area and I asked a
&gt; CHP officer the other day about it and he said that it was illegal to drive
&gt; with them open and that if they saw me doing it, they'd ticket me.  So I was
&gt; curious if anyone has ever recieved a ticket for an open safari.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Alex
