Subject: '59 Single Cab...friggin' shift rod!!!!

Was out of town Friday and Saturday. Went to Elgin in central TX. Saw 
list member Greg S. and his &quot;new&quot; dove blue truck in a parade there. 
Got back last night so today finally got out and started working on 
pulling the shift rod on my truck again.

Previously I tried to remove the front all steel coupler and the 
heads off of both set screws broke. So on list members' advice I just 
hacked the coupler apart. i was able to shave down the side with a 
reciprocating saw and then could see the hollow part in the middle. 
So I hacked it in half right there.

Front shift rod section came on out no problem. Set it aside and went 
to try and get the main shift rod out. No go. It's obviously stuck 
from rust. So I carefully banged on the it from the front side. It 
moved it in some. As I went to work on it I realized it had just 
broke! It was rusted and weak and a few blows tore it right off.

At the rear the main shift rod doesn't seem to be stuck like at the 
other end. I banged down there with no luck. I went back to the front 
and insterted a pipe and banged some to try and break things loose. 
No go.

Looks like right now I'm gonna be cutting at the very least a section 
out of my shift rod tube. I figured I could start at the front where 
the rod seems to be welded to the tube by rust. My biggest problem is 
that the heater tube is directly under and in the way of the me 
cutting/working/welding the shift rod tube. So that means I gotta cut 
it out too. And nothing is wrong with it. No rust or nothing. So will 
just be cutting for nothing. Sucks.

Don't know how or why the shift rod/tube/couplers were so rusted. 
Other parts under there don't seem to be quite this bad.

I will be needing to replace or somehow modify or make a main shift 
rod. It's for an earlier '59 Single Cab truck. Will one from a 60's 
split bus...say '65-'67 work? I know where some of those are and 
might could get one. Might get lucky and find an earlier one. But 
does anyone else have one?

I figure the section of shift rod tube I pull out can be welded back 
in....or replaced with some properly sized pipe. The heater tube 
section I definatly can weld back in place.

Comments and/or suggestions welcome.

Feel like I opened a can of worms...but the truck wasn't gonna be 
going anywhere without fixing this stuff. Hey Ronnie...where's that 
'58 I traded to you...I want it back...I think I kept the wrong 
truck!!!! Damn semaphores sucked me in!!!!!   ;)
