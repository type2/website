&lt;&lt; 
 I got some wheels and frames I want to prep for paint.
 
 I'm hoping to find an inexpensive place that I can drop off my pieces, have
 them 'dip' it into whatever and have it come back to me ready for primer and
 paint?

Hi Roger,
Wish we could suggest some places in your area, but we are in Washington
state.  Instead we can suggest you check out powder coating shops in your
area.  We are having our small pieces (I.E., rims, belly pans, brake backing
plates, axle tubes. and lots more.) of VW powder coated with the new zinc rich
primer they just came out with about two years ago and having that coated with
a color powder coating over that.  In areas where you want a specific color
that powder coating does not have now, get it zinc primered and colored coated
with powder coating.  Then sand the part lightly with 300 grit sand paper and
have a normal coat of paint applied to get the color you want.  Powder coating
is just about impossible to chip off due to it's plastic composition and the
zinc primer will protect from rust getting under the paint from scratches.
