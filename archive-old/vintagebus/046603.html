Subject: Bug Tranny in Bus?
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

This is being posted for a friend as I would never attempt such an evil mod 
on my busses ;)

He recently purchased a friends 1959 Goettls A/C single cab.  This is an 
early 59 which should have a split case.  He needs to have it ready to drive 
to Jerome as the bus hasn't been on the road in 25 years!

Anyway, he has a spare T1 tranny and is trying to figure out if he can use 
that for the trip.  He already attempted the nose cone swap but it didnt 
match up at all.  He is asking for suggestions and so far someone told him 
(not me) that he couldd swap out the hockey stick and use the t1 nose cone to 
fit it in the bus.  I dont have any clue what would work.

Any suggestions?

Dan Howard
