Looks nice, but wouldn't someone want to paint it to match the rest of the
shifter?

I have one on the '55, and had one on the '56, and concur about the
rotating part, but you get used to it...

note: these are GREAT for tall people - less of a reach to the shifter.

I'd prolly get my butt kicked if I mentioned I've bought originals at swaps
for $5 including the bakelight knob.
