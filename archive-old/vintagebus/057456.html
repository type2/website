Subject: Re: RE: [VB] Flip seat Westy/ M code help

SK might be taken from the name Sikkens, but it doesn't come from &quot;special kolour&quot;. Those two words don't exist in the german language. Special in German is &quot;Sonder&quot; and color is &quot;Farbe&quot;, so a special color would be a sonderfarbe.

&gt; 
&gt; I was also under the impression that SK was for special kolour- i assume the postioning of the tag under the seat has to do with the bulkhead missing as per the norm with an so34/35

&gt; 
&gt; i don't believe that &quot;SK&quot; means sikkens paint. i 
&gt; think it is a german abbreviation for special color combination, for 2 main 
&gt; reasons. first, every bus i have seen that has &quot;SK&quot; has been painted from the 
&gt; factory uniquely in some way that is different from the &quot;normal&quot; way they 
&gt; painted a bus. example: my 61 flipseat (and jp's) everything, including the 
&gt; interior, was the lower body color, and only the OUTSIDE above the beltline was 
&gt; white. this is in contrast to say a standard that would be say blue/white, where 
&gt; the interior would be white.
&gt; 
&gt; second: can you imagine the factory having to 
&gt; change the paint in the spray booths every single time an &quot;SK&quot; bus came 
&gt; through?
&gt; 
&gt; i have an original flipseat paint color brochure 
&gt; which specifies the &quot;SK&quot; combinations/number designations for those 
&gt; particular busses. SK 1023 is specified as (body color)turquoise/(roof color) 
&gt; blue white.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;  Another thing. I looked at Everetts site for the colors 
&gt; and at the pics of
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; the bus again and it appears that the color code SK 1023 is white upper 
&gt; with
&gt; 
&gt; a sky blue? lower. This was determined by the inside of the engine lid 
&gt; and
&gt; 
&gt; doors. Has anyone ever seen this combination before and are Sikkens 
&gt; pait
&gt; 
&gt; colors all special order?
