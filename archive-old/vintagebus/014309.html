I don't think people were knocking his ebaying of stuff - his
first message was clear that he was offering the stuff to the list
beforehand; *that's* what people were knocking...

&gt; I eBay parts all the time.  As does Everett and as
&gt; does Thom...in fact I recall one of them even had a

&gt; has to bid on? (correct me if I am wrong and I may
&gt; be)...anyways I am not knocking that...I just find it
&gt; strange when very active eBayers and knockin some one
&gt; else for doin it?  And who cares whether he pre-posts
