Subject: RE: [VB] should I feel bad or good

Hey, I paid a lot of money for that poster.... MOMA and the like make good
money and make good with advertising with works of art they own.

... and I'm not trying to be a *prick* either.... like I said, I think this
whole thing comes down to courtesy.  If you use an image from the web, get
permission first.

Im not trying to be a prick, but its not like i copied your web page, I
copied an image that you most likely did not ask VWOA permission to use in
the first place .and that is very relavant in ths matter , you your self
have &quot;stolen &quot; that image and are using to sell items. I respect the fact
that you took the time to put it online and that it is available to view,
but dont complain about someone doing what you have done.
