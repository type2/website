Hey List,
   I am cleaning the bottom with a 3M sponge rust and paint stripping brush 
which has a very abasive surface and with little effort removes the paint. 
as for corroless over the rust spots...its not &quot;really a paint&quot; as it is an 
epoxy hardened rust stabilizer. It is ment to be applied to near bare metal 
or brushed rusted surfaces to stop and prevent rust from spreading, the rust 
under the layer of &quot;paint&quot; is chemically converted to a more stable form 
from what the ad and the eastwood representitive I talked to said. It takes 
about two or three days to harden completly, but when it has dried it is 
almost like a baked on finish. This stuff appears to be very hard and 
durable but only time will tell. Personally I really enjoy working with it 
(use a filter on this one guys trust me, its a bad headache) because of the 
thickness and covering ability of the product, it is also very apparent when 
you miss a spot which helps alot. It is safe to be painted over with 
automotive enamels and urethanes, so maybe two is better than one even 
though the ad totes about that is dose not need it. Hope this helps, talk to 
you all later!

-Christian
