Hi Chris,

On the '67 MC -- look, we can debate both ways up and down.  But I still
think a MC lasts a long time if you keep water out of the lines, and having
your bus match the Bentley books has some value.  $150 isn't free, so I can
understand.  A true German MC for the later bus isn't cheap either... the
$150 is for a German ATE -- which is original equipment for VW -- vs. most
people are considering the Brazil parts for the conversion...   I'm no
expert, but I know that you have to look at all the factors.  I'm just happy
that the 1967 is available!

Yep -- I did the pictures of the Church bus.  I think Ronnie has someone
coming this weekend for final review and possible purchase.

On the TMI fabric... I will play with the scanner this weekend.  I don't
know how well it will go.  The texture is part of the issue... you really
have to touch the repro stuff to know if it is what you want.

Ronnie and I are talking about how to cut up little postage-stamp-sized
samples and mail them out.  Is there any interest in this?  We only have
small samples now, but hopefully will get more (the production runs on these
new styles has not yet started).

  Stephen Gutknecht

Speaking of original.....You helped Ronnie get the pics of the Church Bus
up. Are you helping him with the pics of TMIs  fabric?. I am excited that
the Platnum Mesh is being repopped and Ronnie had said something about
getting pics up. The '67 has no fromt door panels and I would like to see
what how the fabric looks.

Thanks
Chris
