&gt;     OK this is the deal, I went down to 5 local FLAPS and NONE of them had 
&gt; any in stock.  About a month ago I went in and it was right there just 
&gt; waiting for me.  So what gives?  Anyone in Arizona know of a for sure source 
&gt; for this stuff?

I just bought 2 gallons at Pep Boys this morning.  First GL-4 I picked up
was 140wt.  8.99 a gallon.  I did fortunately realize I needed 85w-90. 
I know you guys have Pep boys there, but they may not stock it.  I went to
Checker because I remembered going to Checker to get Sta-Lube back in
Denver, but they only had Valvoline and it was GL-5.  Pep Boys had 4
different types of Sta-Lube in gallons.  Might be we should stock up over
here before it's all gone.
I'm looking to use this as break in oil for my 3.88 small nut rancho from
Ronnie.  Then I plan on going to Redline GL-4, but it's about $8/qt.
I'm trusting Jack Maynard's testimonial on this one.:)  
I'm tired of cleaning 42 year old gearoil/dirt off stuff today.
