Totally confused. Full oil filtering, total , half then less etc.

So what is that gadget on my engine? That thing sticking out of the oil pump
with the two nozzels? What kind of filtering is that? I havent installed
that oil thingy yet but I want to know about it. I have two engines with it,
one going into my bus and one that had been in my bus before I owned it. Is
this full oil filtering or half?

Funny, it seems I get engines with this gizmo and that dual this and intake
that, but I always run single port, 30/31 pict, stock and go forever (ok not
forever but about 150,000 miles before I have a big problem). Unlike all the
dead engines I recieve into the yard.
