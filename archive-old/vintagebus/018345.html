It's true the 67 outside is a one-year only.
Earlier years wil work, but will not take the same key
as a 67, so if the goal is to have one key for your
bus you need the 67 lever.

Gabrile, the VW locksmith in Stockton, CA has two (or
at least he did at the OCTO show) He wanted $100 each.
If that;'s what you're willing to pay, he can also key
it to your key.

Never bought from him, but he seems like a staple in
the community (?)

Otherwise be patient and try to get one at a show or
on the list or ebarf etc...
In the meantime you can get a regular one and have the
extra key on your keychain, or do like I do and just
open the passenger door and reach over and back and
unlock the cargo from the inside (definitely not as
cool, but gets the job done).
Another note: if you do get one, make sure the square
shaft which goes through the door is the longer one.
Some are shorter. These are for panels, which had no
inside handle, figuring no passengers back there to
need to open it.

Good luck.

&gt; work.
