Hi, I was looking at a 36hp air cleaner I was selling today and noticed the
part # is 261129611A.  I checked my '58 Bus parts book but only 261129611B
is listed and it is listed as &quot;discontinued.&quot;

I was wondering if anyone had a listing for 261129611A and what it fits.  A
potential buyer wanted to know if it would fit his '59 Ghia.  Looks the same
as the other 36hp to-the-side air cleaners I've seen but I don't want to
sell him the wrong thing if there's some Bus-only difference.

Thanks,
