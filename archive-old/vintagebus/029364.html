Subject: Re: [VB] Petrol blockades

I can't believe anyone is even complaining about the price of gas. In
Europe, perhaps. But I am old enough to remember 33 cents a gallon, and
if you index for inflation, gas is cheaper now than it was way back
then. We really have little to complain about pricewise. Now, taxwise,
that's another storey. . .

By the way. . . some of you guys need to study a little logic.
