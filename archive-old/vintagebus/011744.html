Subject: brakes spec needed./ +hello again

Hi folks.

I've just joined the list - was on the type2 list a while back - now we are
2 eh? cool!

I've got a small question for the congregated bus folk.

thing is i've been passed a set (rear+front) of new brake shoes for a split
- not sure tho what year split -- if they're good for me i'll keep em - but
if they're no use i'll pass them on.

does anyone know what years etc the brakes changed?

the shoes i've recieved are the same diameter but one set is narower 56mm
and 46mm respectively.

i've been told by a second party that they came from an old geezer that was
selling a later (65) split but they were prolly bought for an earlier bus
he had before??? 

i've got a 62 and a 54 so they might be ok but instead of keeping them
forever being no use i'd prefere to pass thm on if they're for a later bus.

from memory the pre 63 front shoes are narrower than post 63?  but are they
the same diameter? 

are the rear and front from a post63 the same width? if so this points to
them being at least pre63.

and are the earlier brakes for the barn door bus the same as the pre63
bus'? or are they totally different again? 

i know, i know, the answer would be to strip down the hubs of the buses and
check but i'm not able to do that right now.

heeeeelllllp!

please!

btw, Ken, i've worn my purple type2_dot_com tshirt out! can't figure why i've
got holes in the belly area tho. :-)
