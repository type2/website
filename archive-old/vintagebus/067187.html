Subject: Re: [VB] Heat Exchangers

i usually drive a bay, so i might be on the wrong track here, but 
isn't the heater system pressurized on later splits to keep the 
exhaust OUT? ie, the air from the fan should blow OUT of all cracks 
and holes in the system, not suck air in. any stinky smells SHOULD be 
either 1) exhaust fumes being sucked into the engine fan in the first 
place (bad engine compartment seals, leaky heat riser, what have you) 
or 2) oil that has dripped into the heater box from the heads burning 
off.  on my bay - which has heat for the first time in 6 years :) - i 
get a smell like popcorn at the movie theatres from a drippy valve 
cover. ick.

if you ARE getting exhaust smells in the car, and the engine 
compartment/bad seals are not the source, it would mean that the 
'j-tube' inside the exchanger has rotted through.
i imagine the older 'stale-air' system invalidtaes this theory.
