I still have the 67-only 2/3-1/3middle seat frame and
rear seat w/ original caramel browmn upholstery for
sale. 
 - - ---  -
caramel?  but thats upholstery for the 8/58-2/61 standards, isn't it?   67 
would have salt and pepper (most commerical, and standard micros) or grey (if 
from an ivory commercial),  the blue/white deluxes had the blue/white 
interior, the green/white and red/white deluxes had the mesh platinum 
interior which turns a sort of coppery colour which is the closest to caramel 
that came original to a 67.   just wondering.   does your rear seat for the 
deluxe bar?   the middle seat has the plasticy rubbery covered bar on top 
like the dash grab handle?  I can't look at web sites right now as my 
computer died just out of warranty and am waiting for the cheap motherboard 
and in the meantime am using a black and white screened laptop so websites 
are blurs.  cant deal with colour.
