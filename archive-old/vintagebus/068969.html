Subject: Newspaper Article:  local VW Bus owners use cooking oil for
  fuel

We had a recent newspaper article mentioning a local couple running their 
bay window bus on used cooking oil.  It only mentioned they were filtering 
it a couple of times to remove the gunk.  Not that I want my bus to smell 
like a fries and try this.  I'm just curious if anyones done it or knows how 
you would.
