&gt;   1.Is it true that a double cab truck has no 'treasure chest' under the 
&gt; bed?  It appears the rear bench would be in the way, but did any years 
&gt; have a small place to stash stuff?

Not like the SC.  There is space under the rear seat and it extends back a 
little more than a foot beyond the rear window, under the bed.  You should 
see the load of stuff I can store under there.

&gt;2. Is there a double cab-specific roof rack available or do dc owners just 
&gt;adapt standard racks?

I've seen mid sized racks out there, but can't tell you where.

&gt;3. What is the deal with the metal around the DC rear window?  kinda looks 
&gt;like 4 triangle stamps in the metal coming to a point.  Is this finding 
&gt;a  factory marking or some custom crap?

Factory marking.  The stamping adds strength to the metal and keeps the 
rear window from wobbling as you zoom down the road.

&gt;4. Are safari windows any better than they were 10 yrs ago? When the 
&gt;repros came out, everyone complained about them cracking if you drive with 
&gt;them even slightly open.  Are there any good ones available today? When 
&gt;closed, is leaking a problem in the rain?

Look out, here comes the safari FART.  Best check the archives for an 
answer on this one.

&gt;5. Does anyone have a nice 58-61 double cab they would like to sell to a 
&gt;good home?

check http://www.thesamba_dot_com   you should find a few there.  I'm keeping mine.
