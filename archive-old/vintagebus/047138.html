 This last week I got a call from this guy who said he was moving, last I
knew, he had a 58. He asked if I could come and make an offer on the remaining
parts. I asked, &quot;remaining?&quot;, he said that he had to move, and had to get rid
of the bus, said he had a neighbor hauled off the rest of the hulk. Well, I
met him and bought the parts, this must have lightened him up, because he told
me where the rest of the bus was. When I got there, the bus was soo
unrecognizable, only thing sticking up was the steering wheel. He is an artist
and tried to cut the roof off and make a platform, (?), that didn't work so he
killed it, he cut off the entire wall, not to save the pieces for anyone, but
to make it easier for the scrap guy. The neighbor told me that the guy thought
his brother was going to help him. This bus looked as if it was floor pan, I
was able to buy the nose which is kind of rough, but it did have weld in
brackets and adjustable plates. I saved the nose and it is now hanging up in
our shop, forever saved! I made arrangments to buy the rolling chassis because
the beam, tranny, steering gear, etc., etc., etc., was still there. The moral
of the story, cutting is not a good idea. He thought it was, and now look. In
over his head.

PS  I knew this bus before he did this, it's like we lost a good friend around
here.
