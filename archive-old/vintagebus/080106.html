Subject: re:more 6V conversion.._dot_used motor

Was asked:
&quot;(funny thing is with fan belt off it didn't rub, but with belt on it did
... go figure)&quot;

I'd imagine this is related to the generator bearings...if they are worn
out-I think you will get the symptom you are describing...better to replace
bearing with engine out-because you need to remove engine to replace
bearings, and if the bearings go-BTDT, it kind of sucks trying to find a 6V
generator.

AS for blowing smoke at start up-if the engine is sitting for a long time I
think that oil would work its way past the rings, and into combustion
chamber-then burn and smoke away...or you also mentioned that the oil level
was pretty high-the extra oil could also burn off.

Just some suggestions....good luck...
