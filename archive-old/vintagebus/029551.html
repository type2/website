Subject: Re: [VB] NOS deluxe grab handle

Could be but actually mine was built in Nov of 57 and to get on another
topic that I don't recall is... is my bus a 58 or 57 model year?
According to Thom's table it is a 57 model year but then I've heard
different from other sources. Wasn't there a time when model years
started in January not August. Not sure what to call it so I've been
saying 57 since it was made in 57. So were when the grab handles
factory?

&gt; &lt;&lt; Hey Jason! Yeah my 57 deluxe had an original handle. They come with the
&gt;  chrome ends. And as far as I know I thought allbusses had chrome ended
&gt;  handles, could be wrong though. They are out there. Check OCTO they are
&gt;  not hard to find. I think we even have a few.

&gt; Hey Cory, 57's didnt come with dash handles. Had to be dealer or owner
&gt; installed, so it aint hard evidence.
