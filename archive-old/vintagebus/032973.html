Hello all,

I'm in the process of converting my 62 SC from 6 to 12 volts....its been a few
years since ive done this.....I can't seem to remember for sure, but isn't a
adapter bushing needed to use the 6 volt starter? By the way, I'm using the
stock tranny, with a 69 1600 engine (12v flywheel).....and the bellhousing has
been clearanced to fit..Thanks in advance....

62 SC
Beto
