&gt; You know the sound is &quot;not right&quot; when you hear it.  The noise goes away at medium to high revs.  I thought it might be a generator bearing but taking the fan belt off made no difference.  The noise was coming from inside the case but didn't sound like rod knock.  It was clear the case needed to be opened up.  
&gt; We found the John Muir Sounds website after the engine had been torn down and fixed.  If you've heard cam rivet noise before you can hear it in the Muir cam noise WAV file.   I wouldn't be able to pick out the rattle noise of the cam I hadn't heard it in a real engine.  I hear it now.
