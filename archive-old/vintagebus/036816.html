I have a 57 panel that I am working on, I bought the bus out of an old VW
shop. The bus had been sitting there for awile, and the roof had gotten some
dents, and where the dents were, water had sat and made some rust pin holes.
Being that it is a panel, and you'll be able to see from the underside of the
roof if any repairs have been made, it made me think. So, here is what is
going to happen, a body guy who works on VWs says he can cut out that section,
and seem it in at the drip rail, and under the inner roof supports. My dents
are the kind you might call &quot;oilcan dents&quot;, they like to pop, up and down. I
thought about cheaper ways to do it, but for about 500.00 beans, I think it's
worth it.
