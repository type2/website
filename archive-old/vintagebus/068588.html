Subject: Leaning Bus..

Hi, All!

Hopefully this is not a silly question, but, I noticed that my bus is leaning 
to one side about an inch or so. I checked the tire pressures in all tires 
and they are right where they should be. Anything else I can look for? It is 
really starting to bother me, and I can't figure out the problem. :)

Thanks as always,
Justyn Shultz
