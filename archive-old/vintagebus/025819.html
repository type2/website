Actually it was a 70s party. My wife and I went as hippies driving our
64 Single Cab. When we got their we realized it was late 70s, Disco
Attire. We however made a big commotion when we arrived in the SC,
everyone came to check it out, WOW, NEAT, GROOVY, ect. Shortly there
after another couple arrived in a 1977 White T Top Corvette hardly any
one went out to see it. After several people got good and LIT, someone
said, lets see how many people we can get into the Volkswagen, so next
thing I know I have around 20 or so Drunk people pilling into the back
of the truck. Everyone loved the old VW and hardly paid attention to the
vette. I know I have a lot less invested in my VW and it was still the
hit of the party, that was Soooooo Coooool.
