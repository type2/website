Joe Fournier dragged home a carcass this weekend and he says Pandora can
have the nose off it (which is in fine shape). She came with a donor nose
but it's a rough square that stops inboard of the headlight buckets, but
she has some body damage that that won't cover, so I'm glad to have a
chance at a more complete nose.

Question for the experienced: if you have your choice, where is the best
line to take the nose? I'll probably do this with an abrasive wheel in a
Skil saw. My neighbor has a Sawzall if that is preferable but when I've
used the wheel in the Skil I've liked it.

Having got the nose, is it best to flange the bus, or try to cut accurately
and butt-weld it instead? Joe has a 110-volt MIG but we don't know what
we're doing.
