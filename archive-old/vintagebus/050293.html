Subject: Intake manifold gaskets

Hello!

At the risk of asking the stupid question of the day (week/month...);

I was about to install the intake manifold on my 1500 SP engine, when I
decided to check Muir to make sure I didn't dork it up.

Muir refers to copper &quot;gaskets&quot; - which I successfully located in my gasket
set.

However, as I looked at the intake port on the head, it appears that there
is a (much flatter) copper seal in there already.  Preliminary poking at it
makes me think it doesn't want to come out very easily.

Before I go nuclear on attempting to remove the existing copper seal
(assuming that it is an old already compressed intake gasket), I thought I
would humble myself before the list and ensure I am not about to remove
something that is supposed to stay!

Thanks

Dave in San Diego
