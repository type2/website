It is a small fan that fits onto the 3&quot; heater channel that goes from the
engine to the defrost/heater vents. You cut out a section and clamp this fan
in and run a switch to the dashboard. It improves the heat flow by about a
million percent. It blows heat even when you are at an idle.

There is a company that sells a kit advertised in Hot VWs that is not wildly
overpriced, but it is available at any good boating store. Just ask for a 3&quot;
inline fan.

&gt; What is &quot; I put in a boat inline fan to boost the heaters (A GREAT
IDEA!!!!) &quot; as Denis Dodson wrote?

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I put in a boat inline fan to boost the heaters (A GREAT IDEA!!!!) and
drove it a week ago in the snow, and I'm installing the AC later this month.
Yakima now makes some tower extensions ($40) that make their raingutter
towers tall enough for the bus and now I carry ladders on top.
&gt; &gt; It makes fun out of driving.
