Hey y'all
Despite the subject I wasn't feeling that way yesterday.   Got the chance to 
spend 2 whole days with my family after working 14 days straight.  Was a 
great weekend, even split/stacked the last of the big red oak in my wood 
drier.  Fixed the light in the cellar stairs (diagnosed it backwards - the 
bulb didn't rattle so it MUST be the switches).  Turned out to be the bulb.  
Even got to drive the kids (&amp; neighbors kids) to school in the Award Winning 
Burrito Express.

Got in trouble for taking the 3 days (1 day transit time to/from the farm).  
Right after that during the drive back to Chuckytowne (just past the place I 
broke down last time) she missed, caught missed.  ^$(*&amp;#!!!  Then she 
started the all too familiar backfire Blamma Blamma pop kerpowie and off to 
the shoulder we coasted.  Hop out, first thing to look at is the points.  
They had closed so that's an easy adjust.

Started right back up.  Good idle.  Ease into gear, let the clutch out, no 
RPMs under load and, that's right, Blamma Blamma pop kerpowie and off to the 
shoulder we coasted again.  Hmm.  The points had a little burn to them, not 
too bad, let's change them out and replace the condenser anyhow.

Open the spare bus locker.  I knew my spare dizzy is in Snoopy's Terra so 
just do the on hand parts.  Found points.  No condenser.  (&amp;*^!!

Did you know that a semi passing you at 80 mph creates sufficient wind to 
blow the little screw that holds your points in the dizzy 5 feet into the 4 
inch tall grass?

About this time the good Mr. Occifer comes by &quot;got trouble?&quot;.  &quot;No Occifer 
Odie, I just stop at random and throw vital distributor parts into the 
weeds&quot; I neglected to say.  I thanked him for stopping and said I figured 
I'd be ok.

Found the little screw 30 minutes later, installed and gapped the points.  
Try again.  This time she wouldn't even idle.  (*&amp;(*!!!

Tested continuity and resistance across the primary side of the coil.  3.6 
ohms, within spec.  But wait, things seem a bit loose.  Just fer fun, take 
the coil bracket off the shroud.  Coil falls in hand.  I say unkind word.

I &quot;happen to&quot; have another coil.  No install until I find a suitable nut for 
the coil mount tensioner (the screw that you tighten to hold the coil in 
place).  Nothing lke it in the spare bus locker.  Nothing under the seats.  
Finally I use the US standard nut on the metric screw, carefully letting 
them deform each other into some semblance of thread.

Bolt into place, hook up all wires, turn key.  Starts into low idle.  Set 
the timing, idle goes where it usually sets.  Put tools and spare bus away.  
Ease into gear and down the road we purr.  2 hours later she quits - like 
someone turned off the switch.  Sure enough, the power wire to the dizzy had 
come off.  Easy fix.

End up taking the calls for work.  Dodge melanin enhanced intelligence 
deprived individuals who are attempting to operate motor vehicles in the 
same spacetime coordinates I am currently occupying. I'm not prejudiced 
though it seems that most of the folks going all f(*kitty down the road have 
this common trait and have way kewel chrome chain liscence plate frames.

Make it to court almost in time (remember the taillights deal?).  Show the 
Mr. Occifer a blown fuse and the ticket gets dismissed.  Calls from work 
keep getting worse.  I have not been in such a foul mood in years.

But wait there's more.

My girlfriend (Ghidorah the 6 year old Iguana) had escaped this weekend from 
her condo.  Found her this afternoon in the back yard with ants crawling out 
her nose and stiff as a board.  Looks like she froze to death.

To top it all off, I'm no longer on 'my time' as far as work's concerned.  I 
just completed 20 years in the Coast Guard and am now on my involuntary 
extension.  Lost a good job and had to unbuy a house because the command I 
work for had to try and play politics and I lost as the result.

So enough whining.  I have questions.  This is the second coil in 3 weeks.  
This time the points had closed a bit.  However, the common element I can 
think of is the tachometer.  A Sunpro 2.5&quot;.  That's the only thing that's 
been hooked up to the coils the whole time.  I removed a Pertronics unit 
thinking that had caused the last failure, returning to the way of the 
points.  Also, you may recall that just before the coil died the last time I 
saw the tach needle oscillating wildly.  Only other thing I can think of is 
the coil holder being loose might cause an erratic ground, causing secondary 
winding failure (no didn't test the secondary windings before I littered).

O gurus of the list, please enlighten me as to where I erred, and guide me 
back to the path of carefree motoring.  Why are my coils failing?

Thank you in advance for your help as always.  May the countenance of Mr. 
Natural beam upon your wanderings.

Mad Uncle Dave
