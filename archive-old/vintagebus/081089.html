Subject: Re: [VB] Crusty Oz twin cab update

Colleagues,

Doe's Rob's work rival Metwiz, or what?  That's a compliment to both. 
Obviously Rob hasn't spent much time in the Pub over the past several
months.  . . .  nor at Rye, nor Torquay Anglesea, Bell's Beach . . . :-(
   (Inside joke)

Rob, do you still have your sweet '58?  Next in line will be the
rag-top barndoor?  Is that it in front of Leo?  It is the right color,
as I recall.  I assume you were able to use the Pig Iron I brought over
for you last year on Leo?

I suppose you'll not stop until every bus in Oz has been restored? 
Best hurry on the mechanicals, as &quot;The south . . . ,&quot; er, &quot;the Yanqui
Dolare shall rise again.&quot;  It is already back up to a buck forty three,
up from a low of a buck twenty three.  

BTW, Qantas sent me an email AD, . . . LA to SYD rt. $599, to Melb. for
a hunnert more!

AND, folks, rob does all this work in a single car garage (width)  It's
long enough to house two busses, which it usually does)  Keep 'em locked
up Rob.

Quiz of the day?  Can the RAAF fly?  Ans:  yep, with this guy working
down under they sure can!  Think what he can do with aluminium alloy!

Best,

Curt
