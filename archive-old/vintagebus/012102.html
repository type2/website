Erin and All;

Last year my wife found herself in a similar situation at a local fast
food joint -- she was driving our 1970 Campmobile.   The woman behind her
became so angry that she rammed the back of our bus with her late model
sedan, setting a nice example for her carload of kids.  The sedan lost,
big time, making the lady even more angry.  Our bus was unscathed.

After the lady calmed down and regained control of her senses she
realized what an ass she'd made of herself.  Then she paid for my wife's
meal.

&gt; So I placed my order and as I drove up to the window, I told the gal,
&quot;I'm also paying for the gentlemen's meal behind me.&quot; - which I did. &lt;
