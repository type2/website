Subject: SW gas heater question.....

Hi all,

I was given a SW gas heater on Saturday (woo hoo!!), but it was in pretty bad
condition. After spending a day on it, going through everything, I went to a
friends house and snagged some parts from some SW gas heaters he had laying
around his yard. I put on a good working ignition, but none of the mechanical
fuel pumps were in working order (the rubber check valves were hardened).
There were a couple of T1 SW gas heaters that did not have mechanical fuel
pumps on them, and one had an electric pump mounted to it that looked
original, although it does not say anything on it stating manufacturer. I
fixed the electric pump (I think it sat full of water for a while) and plumbed
it straight to the burner. The heater fired right up and kicked out some
serious heat, and after figuring out that the electric pump had to be powered
where the coil is so the thermostat would turn it off along with the coil when
it kicked in, it was functioning perfectly.

But, because this is the only first hand experience I have with gas heaters, I
was wondering if it was normal for the exhuast to put out black smoke (just
faint, but it is there). It's not a lot, but you can see it. Is it supposed to
burn perfectly clean, or is this how it is? I'll be installing it next
weekend, and want to make sure that something isn't 'funked' before I go
through the trouble. I assume it's fine, but it never hurts to double check!

TIA
