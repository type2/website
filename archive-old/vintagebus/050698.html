&gt;  Recently I ordered some parts from busdepot_dot_com. It was terrible. They
&gt;sent the wrong stuff(actually screwed up the order so bad it was pathetic)
&gt;and weren't the most coperative with me trying to straighten out the order
&gt;and get what I needed. I need a place that will take care of me and send 
&gt;the
&gt;correct parts out quickly. Don't mind paying the price it takes.
&gt;Thanks
&gt;John
