&lt;&lt;2600-2800 rpm isnt an option for me. with my small nut '66, 3000 rpm has me 
only going 40mph! when i get out after a long run on the highway at about 
55-60, she doesnt seem to be that hot. one time, while fueling up returning 
from the Detroit show, i checked the oil and the dip was pretty f-in hot 
though. i could just barely stand holding it. for a summer driver like me, 
maybe an external would be the ticket. &gt;&gt;
Hi Bob,
Unless you live near the base of some huge mountains like the Alps or Rockies 
and drive up a long steep hill to work and coast down to home your tranny is 
not a good one for traveling especially on todays highways!  Sounds like you 
have a bug tranny or badly rebuilt bus tranny in it or maybe even Mountain 
RGBs on it.  A external oil cooler would be like trying to bail out the 
Titanic with only one pail!
    We used to drive our 1963 SC around at 55 MPH which by ear sounded like 
about 3,000 RPM which we had found to be just right for good MPG and engine 
longevity in bugs and a Ghia that we had got into VWs with.  Then got our 
1960 panel camper conversion for free with a DP engine in the cargo bay with 
a connecting rod sticking out of the top of the case!  Rebuilt a new big bore 
40HP engine for it and then could not get the panel over 45 MPH floored 
though it did not sound we were pushing too high of RPM!  Tached the panel 
and found RPM at 45 MPH was 4,000 RPM or 3,000 RPM at 35 MPH.  So tached our 
SC and found we had been doing 3,800 RPM at 55 MPH!  Boy were we shocked and 
chagrined!  
  Previously to this we had been having all sorts of problems with the SC 
with low oil pressure and high oil temps.  It was not unusual for us to end 
up with oil light flickering more on than off at idle minutes after climbing 
hills!  Plus lousy MPG of 18 or sometimes 19 MPG.  When we dropped our 
cruising speed to 3,000 RPM at 47 MPH MPG shot up to 27 MPG in the SC and 
soon after in the panel when we installed another small nut stocked geared 
1960-63 tranny in our panel.  Both buses now had higher oil pressure and ran 
cooler also!  Previously engines tended to wear out about 40,000 miles or 
less to the point we could not trust them.  From then on our engines tend to 
last 80,000+ miles before they start to show signs of needing rebuilding.  
Valves run cooler do not stretch and thusly we only need to adjust one or two 
 of the eight valves at each tune up!

   Now that we have gone to a 1641SP engine 7.1:1 CR with DR case and 3.875 
R&amp;P with .82 fourth we are getting easily over 24MPG (Long trips we get 
25+MPG).  This results in a huge saving over the miles just in fuel.  We put 
on an average of 20,000 miles on just one bus per year....  Going with just a 
3 MPG increase 18 MPG to 21 MPG over 40,000 miles results in 
40,000 divided by 18 MPG = 2222.222222222 gallons of fuel used.  This means 
at todays price of 1.50 per gallon here in the USA for low grade fuel is 
$3333.33.

40,000 divided by 21 MPG = 1904.761904762 gallons of fuel used.  This means 
at todays price of 1.50 per gallon here in the USA for low grade fuel is 
$2857.14.

Total savings of $476.19

Double the above amount for getting 6 MPG increase (24 instead of 18 MPG) 
over 40,000 miles or just getting a 3 MPG increase (21 instead of 18 MPG) 
over 80,000 miles either way results in savings of $952.38

Double this last figure to get the savings of getting a 6 MPG increase (24 
instead of 18 MPG) over 80,000 miles.  Result is $1904.77!   

Thus since a well rebuilt tranny with some good used parts like gears and 
syncros or almost all new parts tranny should last 200,000+ miles over only 
half this time will pay for the tranny easily, plus most if not all the cost 
for an engine rebuild!  Plus get you up to speed for freeway driving safely 
with the 3.875 R&amp;P freeway flier or at least a 1960-63 stocker 4.125 R&amp;P 
tranny with .82 fourth and your 1964-67 RGBs to get your speed up to about 55 
MPH at 3,000 RPM.  If you or anyone else is interested in freeway tranny info 
we will be glad to Pmail what we have so far.  Eric&amp;Barb
