Does anyone know which of the mail order places sells S&amp;S exhaust 
components?  Does S&amp;S out in Arizona sell directly to consumers?

Exhaust systems are widely advertised in the Hot VWs ads, but they 
never say who makes the parts, and I believe they're usually the 
Taiwanese Bug Pack versions that have a shorter lifespan and are more 
of a pain to install.

thanks,
	Mark
