&lt;&lt; (1) Of those who have fitted later bay tanks has anyone used the bay 
sender and a gauge (what gauge suits?) to get a working fuel gauge with this 
setup?  (no I'm
 not going to hack the dash for the gauge....8-))).  &gt;&gt;
Hi Rob,
We installed a 1968-71 bus tank in our 1963 SC that is running 6 volt system 
and gauge.  Works perfectly so far!
 
&lt;&lt; (2) The bus has a small nut tranny and 36hp motor and the plan is to have 
a 'driver' config and an 'original' config for special occasions.  I could 
fit a big nut tranny and a 1600-1776 single port for the driver config but 
that a lot more work then to go back to the 'original' config (not as easy as 
an engine swap). &gt;&gt;
If you are planning to drive your bus you might be better installing both 
front suspension and RGBs from 1964-67 buses.  20% bigger brakes, bigger 
tougher RGB outer lower bearings and less reduction in the RGBs for higher 
speed.
 
&lt;&lt; Will a later 3.88 bug R&amp;P go in the  tranny reasonably painlessly and work 
with the existing ratios to be nicely driveable with a sought top speed of 60 
mph with the early reduction boxes?  ....opinions sought........  &gt;&gt;
With your pre-late 1962 lower rear wheel wells you will be only able to get 
about 58MPH with the 3.875 R&amp;P, 1964-67 RGBs, .82 fourth, and 205/75R15s 
which are the biggest you can get in there.  Have this same setup (Except for 
215/75R15s on the rear.) in our 1960 panel and love it, but would like to 
keep the higher MPH at 3,000 when we finish installing the cutout rear wheel 
wells and go to the smaller 205s tires.  We probably will be installing a 
3.44 R&amp;P in it and later on in our early 62 flip-seat westie to keep them up 
in the mid 60s MPH at 3,000 RPM.  Then we can just go to smaller tires to 
adjust our top speed at 3,000 RPM down to where we want it.  Plus be able to 
get slightly more room in the rear wheel wells for snow chains! Eric&amp;Barb
