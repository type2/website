Subject: Re: [VB] stuck drum again

Russ,

I would sand the rust off of the brake drum surface with a fine emory, at
least 100 grit, prolly 300. Pitting equals loss of braking surface. You
might consider resurfacing if you can instruct the guy who does it to only
take off minimum to get down below the pitting. Brakes are sensitive to
drum surface quality. Be sure to replace the flex hoses as well. Don't
even bother trying to run the brakes without doing that, unless you know
they are less than 3 years old. I've heard of services that can turn down
overly thick brake shoes.

Your photo looks great. Be sure to grease the adjustment stars where they
go into the cylinder end. And keep everything remorselessly clean til it's
all together. And don't let your greased spindle catch any dust while
fitting the drum back on. I'm starting to sound like the Idiot Manual.

&gt; they're a little pitted and rusty, but still about 50%
&gt; shiny surface...
&gt; it's only stuck on the driver's side.
