Actually, with a vacuum advance distributor, the best
way to adjust timing is with a timing analyzer on
which you can dial in the total desired advance, and
then time the motor in at about 3000 RPM's, or
whatever rate your particular distributor achieves
full advance. I'm weird about timing, though - I
static time, then time at idle, then re-time at full
advance. I know I'm undoing what I did the first time
at each re-adjust, but this method has worked for me
for years, and I'm not about to stop now.
