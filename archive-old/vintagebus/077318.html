Subject: RE: [VB] Boycott Exxon (pretty much no bus content)

I doubt the fisherman and the surrounding residents thought it was a &quot;hoot&quot;. I've surfed in Socal so I know about natural seep age of oil but I doubt that anywhere on the planet 11 million gallons are dropped into the water in such a short amount of time in such a small area. Where that the case the coast's would be lifeless and covered with dead organisms just as Prince William Sound was. 
 It has not fully recovered either. There are a few species of birds and fish that have not fully recovered to pre-spill numbers. 
 I know accidents happen and the crew and Exxon paid them as they should have, the way that crew was run was pathetic. As consumers our biggest &quot;vote&quot; these days especially, is with our wallets. Does not buying gas from Exxon make a difference to them? More than likely not, but I'm &quot;voting&quot; my conscience. 
 It's really no different than my refusal to buy anything new from VW. They are screwing around with what I love so why would I want to help them be successful.
