Subject: shiftrod/coupler - for the record

Hi,

For the record.

Thanks for all your support!

I ended up drilling out the broken (set pin) bolt. The shiftrod coupler 
was
then loose enough to wallop it with a hammer to slide it out of the way.

I tried all sorts of tips on the shiftrod but the shiftrod was stuck
like glue to the rear shiftrod.

I ended up twisting the shiftrod so that I could see the other set pin
hole and used a dremel to slice the shiftrod lengthwise (between the
two holes) and then used the tip of a screwdriver to expand the end of
the shiftrod.

At least I still have the original coupler and can use the two holes to
secure the shiftrod again after I get it welded back up. Messy but it
should work.

NOW I can get back to reaming out the center pin, etc. and get the tools
back to Bus Boys before I get charged the deposit fee.

Conrad
