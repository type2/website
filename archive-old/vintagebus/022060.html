&lt;&lt; Taken from: &quot;`63-`67 Volkswagen Transporter Official VW Workshop Manual ,
Robert
 Bentley, pub.&quot;
 
 `63-`64, 3/4 ton vehicle with 1200 cc engine
 Maximum speed 60 mph _at_ 3620 rpm
 
 `63-`64, 3/4 ton vehicle with 1500 cc engine (optional)
 Maximum speed 65 mph _at_ 3620 rpm
 This bus has identical tranny to the 1200 cc but with 1-26 instead of 1-39
ratio
 reduction boxes
 
 `64 1 ton vehicle with 1500 cc engine (optional)
 At 60 mph 3660 rpm
 Maximum speed 65 mph _at_ 4050 rpm
 
 `66-`67 1 ton with 1500 cc now standard on all models
 At 60 mph 3660 rpm
 Maximum speed 65 mph _at_ 4040 rpm
 
 According to VW, these are all safe and permissible speeds/engine rpm's you
can
 run in your stock bus. Also..If you notice as VW increased the vehicles
engine
 size 1500 cc and load rating to 1 ton, it also adjusted the final drive in
 transmission to actually run the 1500 cc engine at a HIGHER rpm then the
earlier
 3/4 ton vehicles with a optional 1500 cc motor. Seems VW likes the split bus
 engine to run _at_ around 3600 rpms at  top speed.

Hi,
Vw also claimed in thier 1964 bus manual that you could up shift into fourth
gear at 20MPH!!!!!!  If you try this you will find that you will lug the
engine.  The reason VW told some white lies in these two areas, was that they
were trying to keep selling VW buses in the USA.  Back when the speed limits
were 70+MPH and the public was in love with both power and automatic
transmission.  So they fibbed a little on how high a speed you could drive
from 1960 and later, plus they said that one could shift into fourth at 20MPH,
so you could praticly just use only three forward gears making it alot easier
to drive for the person who was not used to a manual transmission.  In the
1950s VW painted not only shift marks on the bus speedo that corresponded to
3,000RPM in the lower gear, but 1,500RPM in the upper gear.  We even have a
dealer circular from 1959 that was a letter to the dealers from VOA stating
that the VW bus should not be driven over 50MPH and that customers should be
informed of this fact.  I would bet that this went over like a lead ballon
with folks that wanted to drive the bus on the freeways that were just being
built in the US in the late 50s and through the 60s.  We have talked to many
old VW mechanics and they agree with our idea of keeping the rev to between
1,500 and 3,000RPM keeps the engine cooler and just about doubles the engine
life and increases the MPG.  Since the bus engine is for the most part a bug
engine.  You might want to ask yourself why VW did not change the gearing in
the bug from 0-15, 15-30, 30-45, and 45-60MPH, again each of these shift
points is at 1,500 &amp; 3,000 and painted on the 1950-60s bug speedos. Instead VW
could have done 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, and then either saving themselfs alot of
money by not installing a fourth gear in the type1 or having a fourth that
would do 60-80MPH at 1,500-3,500RPM on a smaller and lighter VW, with alot
lower cargo wieght allowance.  Eric &amp; Barb     
PS Todd please try a tach on your bus and tell us what the RPMs are at what
MPH and gear please.    Thanks,   EEE&amp;B
