Hi Volks! I've been watching this list for a while and popped in once in
a while. Till now that is. Just got me a bus,,,,,again and it's a 64
again. The first one I had was a DeLuxe but this time I have no idea what
it is. The guy that sold it to me has no clue since he is no VW expert.
It looks like either a Kombi or a panel that was converted. I'll probably
have more info when I decipher the M-codes as long as it still has the
plate. Can you guys look at the pics on my site and tell me what it is?
Is there any way I can replace these crank-up windows with pop-outs? What
about bumpers? So many questions, so little time. Well, I'm glad I got
this bus. Now I have to bring it home. Anyone in my area? I live about 30
miles west of Chicago, between Elgin and Crystal Lake. Thanks Volks
