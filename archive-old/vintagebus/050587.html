Subject: Re: [VB] reduction box sealant

&gt; I am putting the reduction boxes for my bus (big nut) together and I need to know what is the sealant of choice for the reduction box halves(i have the gaskets already). I also need to know what sealant to use for the large freeze plug on the rear (butts up to the spring plate). I use curil for the engine case halves and it doesn't leak- will this work for the rear end as well? I know how bad the tranny fluid smells and only want to do this once. Thanks.

I used Loctite/Permatex Ultra-Grey silicone sealer, in the tube. A thin
coat on both sides of the gasket, a little bit on both surfaces,
especially around the bolt holes, and slap them together. NO leaks.

I also used it the same way on the side gear cover plates. Works great
sealing up the split-boots too.

It was recommended by my engine mechanic, and he insisted that I buy ONLY
the Ultra-Grey, not the Ultra-Blue or Black. NAPA sells it consistently.
