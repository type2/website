Subject: '65 front wheel cylinder connecting brake line

I finally convinced my buddy to get his '65 deluxe going again and am 
really happy to have a local &quot;bus buddy&quot; who I can help with problems 
and vice-versa. Anyway, he is replacing his front brakes completely and 
is a little hung up on the &quot;s&quot; shaped line that connects the wheel 
cylinders. Evidently, He can't get straight brake line pre-flared in the 
appropriate length. He had also mentioned that he has heard of these 
being avilable pre-shaped and ready to bolt on.

My questions to the list are A: Does anyone know where he could get 
these lines new, pre-shaped and ready to bolt on?
B: Does anyone know a source for the proper length straight brake line 
for this job (or a source for custom length lines)?

Your help is appreciated -Jeff
