Subject: Stupid grin

I have had one since finishing the install of my safari's earlier
tonight.  I have had to test drive the crap out of the old girl, and now
I have my radio antennae mounted over the emblem and between the glass
(had to test drive after completing that).  People in this town don't
know what to think, they are all pointing and staring.  I don't have
enough words to express how happy I'm am right now with Clementine's
appearance.  In just two weeks sans job I have accomplished so much, I
will never work full time again, it just wouldn't be fair to her.  Oh
and my wife thinks I'm incredible too (she loves me).
  See I can't even type serious, too happy.

Need to rest, will dream of wind blowing in my face like a big, dumb,
dog.
      Tim Johnson
           and
     Clementine
