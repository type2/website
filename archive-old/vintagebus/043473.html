&gt;i am installing a new generator and voltage regulator,
&gt;after i do this how do i go about &quot;polorizing&quot; them?

Per Muir, install the generator but don't hook up the
regulator yet.  Make sure the generator body is grounded,
either by being mounted in securely or by running a
temporary ground wire from the generator housing to
battery negative.  Then touch a wire from battery
positive to the D+ generator terminal.  Remove this
wire and any temporary ground wire and hook up the
regulator. 

&gt;also i have a 64 kombi vin number 1156209- i think 
&gt;i heard somwhere that the earlier 64's still had the
&gt;pull type handles-being that the 64 was the first year
&gt;for push button type.  is this the case with me?

My '64 Standard, 1 203 065, has pull handles on both
front doors.  It is an early (15 Nov '63) '64.  Yours
is even earlier than mine and probably dates from
around the first of September.  The Doliwa Transporter
book says push button handles started 18 Dec '63 at
1 222 026.

&gt;ps-almost forgot last night while doing a tuneup on my
&gt;super i ran across a spark plug that does not want to
&gt;come out. i am aware of the dreaded stripping of the
&gt;plug so i did not try to turn it. is there somthing i
&gt;could do about this? heat up the head?

I have heard both ways: removing the spark plug while
the engine is warm is either more or less likely to
make it strip.  IMHO the plug will fit more loosely
when the engine is cold so that is a better time to
try, but that may not be correct.

If the engine was other than stone cold when you were
trying, then you might let it get that way and try
again.  While you're waiting, you might put a little
penetrating oil (Liquid Wrench) around the base of
the plug where it screws into the head.  Whatever you
do, not forcing it is a really good idea.

I hope this helps!
