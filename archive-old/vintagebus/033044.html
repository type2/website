&lt;&lt; I'm not sure if earlier shrouds had names, other than &quot;engine cooling tin.

Hi Paul,
Actually they did!  Pre-16DEC62 engine came with stale air heater and shroud 
including fan shroud without the heater hose tubes.  Post-15DEC62 had the 
fresh air heating system and had the air tubes on the rear of the fanshrouds 
from there on.
