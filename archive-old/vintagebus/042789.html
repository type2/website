easy to remove a tire... (dont take my word for this, and you are on your
own as to risks involved...)

1) remove the valve core
2) when tire is flat set it on the ground underneath a heavy object
(car..)
4) take a bumper jack and put the curved side of the baseplate on the tire
so that the curve is very close to the rim...
5) jack up until weight of car breaks bead
6) flip and repeat for other bead
7) take 2 prybars or tire irons and remove tire

thats it...
