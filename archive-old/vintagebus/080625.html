Subject: Re: [VB] Anyone need a tag along trailer?

Here in the midwest we had a tent camper builder by the name of Appleby who
produced trailers in the late 60's to early 70's.  The Appleby trailers were
a few pounds heavier than a motorcycle trailer and a little larger, too big
for a bike, but just right for any VW.  Other than having more space than a
motorcyle trailer is the fact these vintage trailers cost a whole lot less.
A nice vintage trailer will cost less than $500 while most motorcyle
trailers start at that price.

The Appleby's have really caught on around here, we have around 10 in the
group.  I just picked another one up this weekend in Kansas City.  When
unfolded the Appleby's will measure 14 foot by almost 7 foot and will sleep
4 people comfortably.  They weigh empty less than 200 pounds and can be
pulled by any VW or ghia.  For the people who enjoy commercial VW's, having
a tent trailer means you can enjoy camping with the rest of your friends.

&gt; This is not mine.  I was checking out campers on EBay and thought I'd pass
&gt; this along.  Looks like it's be great to tag along behind a Bus, for the
&gt; kids.
