Hey
 Good news, at last it's headed your way.

This is to late for you Dre, but for any one planning
to ship a bus, car or bike, call this company you
won't be sorry. &quot;Bike's Across America&quot; Bob Cooper
915-728-8675.

His driver showed up here the day &amp; time he said he
would,(Called the day before). Loaded up the DC in his
30&quot; inclosed trailer &amp; headed off for the delivery to
NY.
 It arrived there ten days later, a straight
thru,except for a rest stop at his home of two days.
No delays, no sitting over night in some unknown
location waiting for some other driver to pick it up.

Another satisfied customer.
