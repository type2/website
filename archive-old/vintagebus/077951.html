Subject: Another Lazy Mechanic

Spoke with yet another mechanic today.  Supposed to be good.  Turns out he
is also lazy as hell .. says &quot;no problem the broken bolt .. no problem the
slop in the front pivot bushing .. wind the gears out to a higher RMP and
you won't hear the clunk probably.&quot;  GOOD BYE.

The good mechanic will charge me probably $200 to remove the bolt .. but at
least it will be fixed.
