Hello vintagebus,

  I own a 64 bus with a 1600 engine. When i slow down/stop for a traffic
  light after cruising at 50+ mph the engine will stall between 20 -
  30 mph. Roxy always starts right back up using the ignition or
  popping the clutch.

  she runs great. no oil useage. not rough running etc.

  I have tried a few ideas. This weekend I will replace the air and
  fuel filter and check for leaks in hoses. Does anyone have any other
  ideas?

Thanks,

Thomas                          mailto:sixty4_Bulli_at_worldnet.att_dot_net
