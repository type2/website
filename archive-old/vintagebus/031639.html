I'll have to go through my buckets and bins of OLD nuts and bolts. I have 2
buckets (5 gallon and heavy, of OG Porsche (same as VW) already replated
(clear zinc) and a couple more not redone yet. This was about the only AR
thing I found in restoring Porsche's. When final judging in the street
concours was completed in the case of a tie the names on the bolts could be
the tie breaker, then if still a tie, it would get down to having the
correct named bolts on the Generator backing plate and the ones on the sheet
metal, they were different. We figured out that the shrouds were assembled
somewhere different then the rest of the engine as they always had different
named bolts, now that is getting AR.

ronnie again, it's lunch time

Anyone know if spring plate polts were plated black or silver?
I'm thinking black but wanted to double check before I send them out.
Don'tlook at my bus too hard......you might see some surface rust
underneath.

Of course it is, we're talking about classic cars here.  I know a couple
of Model A ford fanatics who not only look for the correct markings but
also for the correct plating.  Having zinc plated bolts where the bolts
should be galvanized means the difference between winning and losing at a
Ford show!

May VWs never get that picky!
