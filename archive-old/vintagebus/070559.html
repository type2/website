Subject: Re: [VB] Progressive

&quot;But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the
same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is
their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide
new Guards for their future security&quot;
-- excerpt from the Declaration of Independence

As long as we allow such abuses such as this, complaints about them are
trival.

Because I gave hayrides to benefit a childrens shelter, Progressive
insurance cancelled me.  May they rot in Hell.  Whenever you are talking to
one of their agents, insurance companies will record EVERY word you say,
often to be used against you.  Cavat Emptor.
