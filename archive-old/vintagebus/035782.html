&lt;&lt;What is defined as a &quot;show car&quot;????




&gt;As has been discussed in this newsgroup a couple weeks ago, there

&gt;are some major changes to the show, including:

&gt;

&gt;    - No modified show classes.

&gt;    - Show cars only will be allowed to enter the park.

&gt;    - All show cars must park with their class.

&gt;    - All show cars must remain parked until after 3pm.

&gt;    - No fires or BBQ's.

&gt;    - No Alcohol.

&gt;    - No pets.
