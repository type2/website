really last night something just reminded me.

Im in a junkyard, middle florida landscape, palmettos,sand, slash pines...
and I find a 59 panel full of parts. I remember looking in and seeing NOS
heat exchangers I remember examining the bullet lights and looking over
the body all straight surface rust and some skimmed and sanded bondo.
Then I remember driving it around the yard the motor was kind of tired and
puttery and it had a bench seat and then I woke up.
I felt kind of nice but a little sad and was wishing I would fall back
asleep.

true. pity me. im sick.
