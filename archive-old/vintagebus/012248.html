Hi Steven;

The carburetor sounds like the Weber that was built and sold for several
years as a replacement for the original equipment Solex 28 and 30 PICT
carburetors.

This carb is no longer available, or I'd be running one of them on my
1970 Campmobile right now.  It's an excellent unit, and I was very
pleased with the one I used for over 200,000 miles on my old '68
Campmobile.

Johnny's Speed and Chrome (now defunct, I believe) was a distributor of
these carbs and also provided a rebuild kit.  Another vendor may still
have the kit, but I was told by a Weber factory rep. that the carb had
been discontinued.

&gt; One thing that I can't figure tho, the carb.  It has a tag riveted to
the top of the float bowl and the only other identifying marks are a &quot;W&quot;
in a couple of areas.  Brazillian?  It's a carb I've never seen before. &lt;
