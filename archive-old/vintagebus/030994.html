Michael,
I've one of these sitting in my basement...I believe it to be a type 3 
rim used with the wide 5 lug pattern. (of course)  I'm not familiar with 
T3s, but isn't that somewhere around 65-66?  It has no hubcap clips, but 
little &quot;bumps&quot; in the rim like a late bus would have, and the hub cap 
just presses on and is held on by the bumps on the rim.
Thats what I think it is...

Isaiah

but instead has three &quot;notches&quot; that would hold a hubcap on.
&gt; The rim is wider than a Beetle rim, and has the same &quot;slots&quot; like a bus
&gt; rim....
&gt; Any ideas??
&gt;
