Subject: Re: [VB] hemp slip on seat covers still available?

the benefit of the hemp/cotton denim seat covers that we make are that you
can take them off and throw them in the washer and clean them, and they
protect new seat upholstery as well as old,
we are only making walkthrough seat covers at this time, unless you want to
stop by mobile, alabama so we can measure your seats,
jb/alabama

&gt; Uhhh, but what would be the benefit of hemp slip on seat covers? Is there
&gt; really a market for that?
