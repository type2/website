Subject: Re: [VB] OT - Thing hard luck story


The first thing to do is gather up all of your receipts.  Then
go out and do 'comps' of similar cars.  The value the insurance
assigns to the car is (supposed to be) of the car *before* the
accident, not the shattered shell.  Find some Thing experts to
back you up on the value. 

When my '59 vert was stolen, I think they had hopes of lowballing
me.  I went in with a stack of receipts, and some ads I'd found
on the 'net for similar cars.  They ended up offering me $6k+,
which was more than I could have got for the car on the open
market, but about what I had into it.  

The most important thing (no pun intended) to you now is documentation.

Insurance companies *love* to lowball VW's for some reason.  They
also love to collect top-dollar premiums beforehand.

Everett can probably dig you up some comps.
