Hi Dave, 

I have a `66 SO-44 westfalia with the optional
dormobile top.  Bought from original owner who
purchased it in Germany while stationed there in the
army in `66.

I don't have the numbers on hand so would have to
check it out at the storage unit in a day or so.

What other info did you need...I do have some pics on
hand too....

&gt; I have a very early 1967 Dormobile (July 5, 1966
&gt; production, 874th '67 
&gt; off the line).  My production plate reads:
&gt; 
&gt; 05 7
&gt; 430 C42 025 108
&gt; UT 2312 523907 7000874
&gt; 
&gt; The bus is essentially a 1 owner bus.  The original
&gt; owner bought it 
&gt; through the tourist delivery program, it was not
&gt; titled in the USA 
&gt; until very early in 1968 (I have the original
&gt; title).  The original 
&gt; owner donated it to the Kidney Foundation, who sold
&gt; it to a used car 
&gt; lot, who sold it to a friend of mine.  The friend
&gt; soon realised it was 
&gt; beyond his abilities and sold it to me.
&gt; 
&gt; Other than the camping interior being gone it is
&gt; fairly unmolested.  
&gt; There are some puzzles though...  The bus has a gas
&gt; heater that 
&gt; appears to be an original installation, yet does not
&gt; appear on the 
&gt; m-code line on the production plate.  Also, from the
&gt; position of the 
&gt; drain hole in the floor of the bus, the camping
&gt; interior was 
&gt; originally a SO-44 interior, not a SO-42 interior as
&gt; the production 
&gt; plate indicates.  The fresh air vent plate is also
&gt; stamped 23-42 as 
&gt; the model, which would indicate a SO-42 interior.
&gt; 
&gt; My guess is the original owners made changes to
&gt; their order after the 
&gt; bus left VWAG and before the Westfalia interior was
&gt; completed at 
&gt; Westfalia Werk.
&gt; 
&gt; What I would be interested in is production plate
&gt; info and bus 
&gt; descriptions from other people with Dormobile camper
&gt; tops and/or SO-44 
&gt; interiors, especially if they were part of the
&gt; Tourist Delivery 
&gt; program.
&gt; 
&gt; If any of you have this info that you could share
&gt; with me, I would be 
&gt; very appreciative.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Dave
