Time to buy a throw out arm.  They are about $15 the last time I did.  
Bentley'l should you how to install it.  Don't lose the circlip!.

In a split case tranny you have to split the case to replace the TO arm.   
Which is tons more work.   But it is also possible to weld an arm back on.

&lt;&lt; After replacing the engine  in my 65 bus and it was running great to BBB 
and 
 around town,  I heard a snap and lost all gears.  Pulled the engine again 
and 
 the clutch release bearing LEVER is broken on one side.  Now there is 
nothing 
 for a new release bearing to snap into....   What can I do?  Is this lever 
 replaceable or am I looking at a new tranny?  I was planning on leaving for 
 Mount Shasta on Wednesday but now.....
