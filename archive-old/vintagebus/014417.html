Subject: [VB] muffler measurements
Message-Id: &lt;199912300154.SAA14692_at_green-dome.village_dot_org&gt;

Could someone who has a relatively new 40hp stale-air-heat muffler go
out and measure the distance between the upper rear mounting studs?
Ideally, it'd be the center-to-center distance.  I'm trying to figure
out whether that muffler will actually fit my setup, which is not
quite stock - it's a 1300 engine, with a mix-n-match of 40hp tin and
1300 tin.  Getting the heat-related bits to all line up is of great
interest....

Thanks much.
