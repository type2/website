&gt;Also, I'm using a generic 2 prong flasher right now. I don't have my
&gt;speedo turn light hooked up. What flasher do I need to hook that up
&gt;properly?

A two-prong flasher should work in your '61.  Connect the speedo light
wire (blue/white stripe) to the same terminal as the black/white/green
wire coming from the turn signal switch.

Starting in about '63, the turn signals were powered from the battery
instead of the ignition, so the hazard lights would work with the key
off.  If you hook up a 2-terminal flasher this way in a '63-'65 Bus,
the pilot light may glow with the key off due to leakage current from
the flasher.  If possible, the simplest solution is to rewire the
pilot light socket so it is connected between the flasher and and
ground, instead of between the flasher and the ignition.

A 3-terminal flasher will also work...the feed goes to X, the lamps go
to L, and the pilot light goes to P.  '63-'65 Buses may have the same
pilot light problem with a 3-terminal, though.

If you've converted to 12 V, an aftermarket #559 four-terminal flasher
will hook up and work just like original.  You can also use the four-
terminal flasher out of a '70-'72 Bus.
