not true,  the brackets were painted while on the bumpers.  
My 58 deluxe has sealing wax red brackets and the splash pans are black.  I 
have had a 57 standard with green brackets and black splash pans, and my 66 
deluxe has white brackets and black splash pans.

&gt;Hi Woody,
&gt;Definitely black.  A semi-gloss would be a good idea, and probably correct!
