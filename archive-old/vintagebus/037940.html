&lt;&lt; So how do you go about retorquing the darn thing to 275 short of beating 
it back on until the holes line up ?  any one else have a better way ?? &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
For pre-1971 buses the torque should only be 217 Ft. Lbs., not 275!  To 
attain 217 Ft. Lbs. you just need to figure your wieght and divide it by 
217Lbs.  In other words if you wiegh only 110 Lbs. you need to stand 2' out 
from the socket on your breaker bar or if you wiegh 217 Lbs. then only 1' out 
from the socket.  Note: We said stand on not jump up and down!    Eric&amp;Barb
