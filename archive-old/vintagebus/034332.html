&lt;&lt; I see that on ebay a guy is selling a screen saver that appears to be
various
 pix he's macked off of VW sites on the net.  &gt;&gt;

Since it is  FRIDAY!!!!!!!!!
Amen Tom! -- Jim tells me I'm crazy, because I search E-Bay almost everyday,
most of the time I find crapola! Like the screen saver dude, This other guy
that constantly posts the same camper cookie jar almost every day ( he must
have a trailer load of them!) not to mention various hotwheels, avon bottles,
etc. Let's not even talk about the guys who post spare parts for sky high
prices as if they had found the holy grail!
Still I have seen some cool stuff.....

A mint complete Hazet toolkit sold for $150...

I saw a good condition 74 camper stool and spare fabric go for $50

and Jim and I bought a '63' camper catalog that has great interior shots,
describes the different kit options and has an absolutely fabulous Tent shot.
By the way if someone promises to host pics on their web site, and not make a
screen saver out of them I will scan the catalog ( about 10 pages) and e-mail
it to you!

Well I am Pmailing you all from San Francisco....(This is begining to sound
like a road trip report) I have sympathy for all list members who live in the
415 area code and are trying to access the internet via AOL. It ain't EASY!
Jim and I are picking up our rental car, which I will Christen LMRC - Late
Model Rental Car. It is a convertible mustang -- certainly not as cool as a VW
but better then an Oldsmobile anything! We will be hoping into LMRC and
driving out to the meet at Pleasanton tommorrow. I will let you know if we
snag anything cool in the swap area. I will probably be asking anyone standing
within 10 feet of a Splittie If I know them from the list so be forewarned!

Later PAM
