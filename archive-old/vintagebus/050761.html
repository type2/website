&gt; Hi Rich,
&gt; You do not mention where you are hammering on it.  Trying to pound it
&gt; straight out does not work!  We have had good luck hitting the part the tie
&gt; rod end goes through.  This momentarly distorts the taper fit that is
&gt; designed to lock the two parts together and pops the tie rod end loose.  This
&gt; should work with the nut loosened or off and only three or four hammer hits.

This can work, but you need a second hammer on the opposite side of the
fitting.  I use a short handled sledge for the stationary hammer and a
hefty ball-peen hammer for the striking hammer.  The axis you strike along
should be perpendicular to the axis of the taper pin.  _Never_ strike the
end of the tapered pin directly!
