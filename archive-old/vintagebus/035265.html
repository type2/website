&lt;&lt; I want to clean the threads and install fresh bolts, without waiting for 
my local nut guy to come up with bolts and have to search for a tap AFTER I 
start the disassembly..  &gt;&gt;
Hi Dave,
The stock bolts are N 10 119 1   Bolt, hex. head M 12X1.5X25 DIN 961 - Spring 
plate mounting from Chassis No. 20 117 902.   
We really advise against using this length of bolt in this application.  
During tranny installations over and over again we ended up with having at 
least one if not two of the stock bolts strip the threads out of the 
reduction boxes when torqued down to stock values.  So now we drill tap and 
retap with a bottoming tap the holes and then install bolts that are about 
40% longer.  Make sure to use Grade 8 or it's Euro equivelant to make sure 
that the bolts are not too soft and stretch or too hard and shatter under the 
stress. 
As for the five speed tranny you would be better off with a freeway flier 
four speed.  Lots less $$ and all stock VW parts.  If you or anyone else are 
interested in the info we have on this tranny we would be happy to Pmail it 
to you.    Eric&amp;Barb
