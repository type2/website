Subject: Re: [VB] humpy 67 gas tank

The tank I pulled out of my '67 (bus is getting body work and paint done) is
the humpy one.  My bus is a Dec. '66 bus, so it's a mid '67.

Andrew
67 Deluxe Bus
75 914 1.8 (for sale)


&gt; I have replaced the tanks in 3 split buses I have
&gt; owned: 2 67's and 1 66, with later bay tanks. [I still
&gt; have the 66 and one of the 67's]
&gt; NONE of the 67's had a bulge in the tank. All were the
&gt; same as the 66, flat on top. One 67 was a very early
&gt; one [July 66], the other is a late one [Feb 27,67].
