This past weekend I installed the windows on my 66 westi with Wolfsburg West rubber.  The rubber seemed to be of good quality and fit very well overall... The only complaint I have is on the passenger front window the rubber curls at the edges a little bit. But even that is nitpicky.

I first soaked the rubber in a bucket of hot soapy water for about 5-10 minutes...  About the time it takes to get the glass really clean with very fine steel wool and windex.  I then carefully set the rubber around the glass and pushed the rubber into its grooves on the glass.  I then rubbed a THIN layer of dish soap on the bus metal window frame.  Then get the rubber/glass assembly and push it into its home.  The window should slide in with ease.  Check the window seating until the dish soap dries and you should be good to go.

Very easy and none of that string hoopla to worry about.

Enjoy,
