An associated problem as recently noted by Bob Hoover
is that the door drains via the hole in the top of the dogleg.
The inlet is a honkin great hole (well comparitively speaking)
while the drains are much smaller.  Thus 'big' stuff (flakes
of rust from the inside of the door, gumnuts, whatever) gets
into the dogleg (often blocking the drains) and can't
get out no matter what you do.

For the non-purist, it is possible to weld in a tube that
goes straight through the dog leg and 'connects' top the inlet
hole at the top.  Thus all the big stuff (and water) passes
straight through rather than accumulating in the dogleg.
Structurally, a welded tube does not compromise
integrity.  

A lot of work?  Not really and after a couple of dog leg replacements
it seems like a minimal amount of work......

Original?  Nope.

&gt; &lt;&lt; There is a little hole at the back rear part of the door, far from the
&gt; hinge
&gt;  and close to the handle, to drain water. The hole lines up with another
&gt; hole
&gt;  in the door frame. That hole goes into the upper rear part of the fron
&gt; wheel
&gt;  well. I have a lake in there. It does not drain out of there. I don't get
&gt; it.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Bob,
&gt; That part of the wheel well is called the &quot;Dog Leg&quot; and in 1955-62 or so
&gt; there
&gt; was only one drain hole in the forward lower part of the dog leg.  In the
&gt; 1962-1967 buses they have two drain holes in the top rear of the dog leg
&gt; and
&gt; the earlier front one.  The rear one looks like it drains into the pillar
&gt; to
&gt; the rear of the door and then on into the rocker panel......
