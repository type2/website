Subject: Re: [missouri_micros] Camping in the Ghetto trip report

Hi all,

Yep!  It was a fun evening with you guys (ya'll cook up a MEAN pork
tenderloin!) but the &quot;Cherokee Lakes campground&quot; has not improved over the
years since we've been there.  Don't worry, there is no chance that we'll be
moving the BNNTA event there anytime soon!  Now, I told you guys that you
could have camped out in our yard that night, but noooooooo...   you wanted
to see the ghetto first hand.  But it was great seeing you all again.

We'll, BNNTA is coming up fast, I hope everyone is ready for the Labor Day
camping ritual.  The Corp of Engineers Rangers say the campground is ready
and they're looking forward to seeing us.  We're doing our last minute
preparations and loading/organization for the event around here.  The
trophies need to be picked up, window stickers too.  Door prizes are
starting to pile up also.  So get your Busses healthy and ready for the
cruise over to Mark Twain Lake.  It'll be fun to see all of the &quot;regulars&quot;,
as well as new Bus fans in just less than two weeks from now.  And as
always, our genuine thanks for your continued support for this old
Bussin'/campin' tradition in the Midwest.  See ya soon!

&quot;Hungry little boy with a runny nose, lays face down as the cold wind blows
in the ghetto&quot;, was the theme a few weekends ago when a few of us buskatiers
went camping _at_ Cherokee Lakes after attending Strausen Fest in St. Louis.

Alex &amp; his Amy, Tom &amp; his Amy, our buddy Daniel &amp; Ashley &amp; me all went to
the car show and festivities of the day. Great German food, bands, crafts
and mid way rides were spread throughout the downtown streets of STL. At the
end of the street between two buildings was the Arch, very cool sight. All
the buskas placed with our buses.

At the end of the day, we met up with Ron in his green '76 westy. Three of
us took the scenic route to our supposed camping destination crossing two
ferry boats, very fun ride. One was the Golden Eagle Ferry which was on the
old BBA cruise route back in the day. Tom &amp; Daniel called to inform us the
park was full, so plan C was in order, since plan B was the park they went
to, because plan A park was full also!!

LIttle did we know, plan C should have been renamed plan G, standing for
GHETTO!

Since we were in the area of Cherokee Lakes campground, the 2nd location of
BBA when it was in STL area, we decided to stay there. BIG mistake, don't
ever go there for any reason. We registered and they told us to pick a spot.
We went around one loop to find abandoned RV's some on blocks, grass grown
around them, nasty. We went to the back area where all of the buses used to
be years ago. It was the tent area and at least did not appear to have
abandoned RV's.. We found a cozy spot in the corner and circled the three
buses. Tom, Amy &amp; Daniel, Ashley decided to go toward home and find a place
instead of back tracking to meet us. Good decision for them due to our
experience as well as Daniel's newly rebuilt engine spun a rod bearing and
was AAA'd home.

We had a great meal that evening, Bill Bowman and Kathryn came out and ate
with us and brought dessert (is this the mass of sand or the food, they
brought food) along. Great fun chatting around the camp fire Alex had made
for us.

Growing tired, we all headed to bed around 1ish ready for shut eye. It seems
our neighbors who were LIVING in the tent a few hundred feet away (complete
with out door micorwave and kitchen) decided to have company over. Their
lovely company shared his car radio with the entire camping loop until just
before day light. Ron said he could hear GREASE playing all night from a
group of girls in back of his bus. Needless to say, we did not have a good
night's sleep and were up around 8ish.  Huumm, Elvis hour was on the oldies
channel followed by Beatle brunch, we all decided to let our tent dwellers
hear some good tunes as the sun rose high into the sky. I hope they really
enjoyed the free music we graciously provided. Ron and I even had the
tambourine and bongos out at one point. Not trying to be mean, just thought
it was a good fair dose of their own medicine.

So, don't even bother stopping off a Cherokee Lakes if in the O'Fallon area.
It's not the same old neighborhood as it used to be. It's like going back to
where you grew up to find the place had became a ghetto. Oh, for those who
can relate to CL campgrounds, the old outside shower was still there. A bit
fallen apart, but still there. Let's hope Lake Leatherwood this weekend will
not offer the same experience.

See you all in Eureka this weekend. Ghetto boy signing out.
