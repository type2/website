Subject: Flywheel/Engine troubles

Hi Gang,

I have a '65 with a 1600 dual Kadrons converted to 12v
&amp; IRS.

Driving out camping the last weekend I noticed my
engine revin' up in 3rd and 4th gear (sometime a bit
in 2nd) without transfering the power.  Odd feeling
when you hit the gas, engine revs but the bus doesn't
really go.  Figured I had some oil doing bad things on
my clutch as everything would catch after a 10 seconds
or so and work fine until I had to shift again. 
Another problem I have had for awhile is starting out
in 1st gear the bus would give quite a shake/shimmy
unless I let it out just right.  I've driven other
busses and haven't had the problem so I know it isn't
just my bad driving.  Got around to a little reading
and figured that my flywheel is probably warped.

Yesterday I yanked the enging, yes the flywheel is
warped and yes there was oil on the clutch.  Pressure
plate and clutch are both still in good shape.  The
flywheel is still attached to the engine (boy aren't
they fun to get off?).  When I push and pull on it
there is about 5 millimeters worth of play.  Is that
normal or should I go through more of a engine rebuild
than just a flywheel replacement?  Maybe I just need
some shims/washers to take out the play when I put a
new flywheel on?  
My other question is about the oil.  Would the oil
sneaking by be caused by the warped flywheel or should
I replace a seal?  Any pointers toward a good resource
for doing that task?  I haven't looked in my Idiots
guide or my Bently yet for this info.

Thanks for your time!
