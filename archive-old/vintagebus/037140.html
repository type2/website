Took a trip to San Diego to check out the junkyards today, found most of the 
buses pretty stripped. Looks like the southern listees have been real busy ; )
Not a total loss,grabbed a stereo for the ch*** out of a car that just came 
in, and a pair of Fiero buckets.
Figured as it was still early, that I might as well head to TJ and grab 
dinner at Tijuanna Tilly's (excellent with Tecate's)
Now this is my first time crossing back across the border in a bus and I 
figured to at least rate a sniff from one of the drug dogs.
Nada, zip, here I am with a white with rust and primer westy stuffed with car 
parts,a big fat Cuban cigar smokin in the ashtray, and a weeks worth of non 
prescription Viagra in my pocket and all I get is 'are you a citizen' &lt;sigh&gt; 
guess it's time for a ponytail.
Bus content, saw 2 splitties and a half dozen bays in a couple of hours
