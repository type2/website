The thing that disgusts me about 'junk' vehicle laws is that they always say
things about being unsitely.  Well, since this is a legal thing, how is
&quot;unsitely&quot; defined?  What if I don't like lawn ornaments, someones flowers,
the color of their roof, the color of their lawn, or the color the leaves on
their tree turn in the fall?  To me, an old car is art and a piece of
history.  Around here, you have to prove the vehicle in question is
operational, licensed, and tagged or put it in an enclosure.  What I do is
go and buy cheapy stockade fence panels and build a quickie enclosure and
all is well.  They used to allow tarping around here but not anymore.  The
cops even think the law is dumb - you can tell it bothers them to have to
harass you for it when just a few houses down sits a house with twice as
many cars in their yard as yours. I simply won't retaliate by calling
someone else in because it reduces me to 'their' level.  I'm better than
that. It's one of those deals where they won't do anything unless someone
phones you in.  I'm just waiting for that elderly crotchety old neighbor man
across the street to kick the bucket.  I'm seriously going to be so happy
when he's gone because he's caused me so much grief and pissoffedness it
ain't funny.  I'm tempted to piss on his gravestone once he's pushing
daisies...

Good luck to you all...
