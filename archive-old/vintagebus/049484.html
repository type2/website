Subject: Re: [VB] Thermostats / heat flaps



&gt;&gt;Some people think that if you remove the flaps then the air does not
&gt;&gt;circulate correctly over the jugs and prevents proper cooling.
&gt;
&gt;I'll say that's horseshit until someone demonstrates it with calibrated
&gt;measurements under controlled conditions.


Then talk to VW, or search the archives for Bob Hoover's TESTING of shrouds
with and witout flaps ... the flaps direct air properly AND make a back
pressure of some kind, tho I don't know why that would be desirable.

Wire the flaps open if you want, but at least put em in.

Once again: WHY would VW piss away $3 of metal in EVERY motor if the money
wasn't necessary? They could easily have designed the shroud to direct air
WITHOUT the flaps and junked em; they didn't, and the shroud must work WITH
the flaps to work properly.
