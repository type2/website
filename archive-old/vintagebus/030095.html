This is my second reply to this, but I feel that I have some good info.  I 
work with a structural engineer and passed on this question.  She replied that 
fiberglass is by far the best way to go.  Higher psi strengths can be reached 
this way and it should be cheaper than laying steel. The reason that we don't 
see more fiberglass in modern day construction is that the codes have not 
caught up with the technology. However, 4 inches is far superior to three 
inches (obviously).  As a matter of fact, 3 inches would not meet code where I 
live.  Hope this helps.  Drew.
