Subject: How to Lower Comperssion ?

My bus is running hot.  No doubt about it.  I'm hitting 220 here.  Hot.

Its not the timing or the carb.  Did a complete tuneup and everything
checked out.

Its a 1641 hydraulic with 34pic3 and stock german bug exhaust with a
009.

I'm beginning to think that perhaps its compression ratio is too high.
I don't know what it is, but its all I can think of.

So the question:  What is the easiest way to lower the compression?

We have no machine shops worth the title in Canada.

Thanks for any tips,
...Markus (and Tardis)
