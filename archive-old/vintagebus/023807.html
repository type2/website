Subject: RE:  help: shudder from a rear wheel

Markus,
You might want to check the torque on the rear hub nuts (those BIG
suckers). My experience with these being loose is a knocking noise,
especially when turning corners, followed by lack of mobility 'cause the
splines are all chewed off the inside of the brake drum.

Just a thought,
pd
&gt; 
&gt; I think that all this talk about bearings and redux boxes lately has
&gt; jinxed me.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm getting a clicking noise accompanied by a vibration from one of my
&gt; rear wheels.
&gt; 
&gt; I can reproduce it by pushing the bus with the engine off.
&gt; 
&gt; I can NOT reproduce it with the wheel in the air.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm hoping this isn't the diff.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any thoughts beside bearings?
&gt;
