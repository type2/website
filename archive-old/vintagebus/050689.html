Subject: RE: [VB] More Q's on Progressive Carb Mount

You are right about the plunger, but when I go to the wrecking yard I pull
the pump, the plunger, and the stand. I consider the three pieces a matched
set!

Vee Dub Knuts,

Ray Heath responded to my question yesterday about mounting space problems
with a Weber progressive.  He said that a '74-79 fuel pump would do the job.
Wouldn't you have to change in inner plunger?  Aren't they different?  I
believe they are longer in the newer pumps, right? 

I almost think it is easier to just buy an electric pump, but my son says
no, because you have to route a pressure relief line back to the tank.  Is
this right?  I had one on my '73 Bug but it broke and my mechanic at the
time just replaced it with a mechanical one.

Best,

Curt
