I think VW didn't really think of these buses being around 30 or more years
later.

Access holes for the belley pans seem like a good idea, in terms of being able
to check for rust etc in the future. A friend who is working on his mom's
double door panels is thinking of doing that.  VW didn't paint in there, which
helps the rust.   I like the idea of the nuts welded in on the pans to bolt a
cover underneath.   It should have drain holes though.

VW dormobiles were made on sunroof combi bodies and have subfloors, but no
storage under there.   Westy campers with the square poptop were made from
regular combis bodies structurally (white paint and dash stuff though) and had
no subfloors.   

I personally would not want to climb under my bus to get stuff out of an under
the floor storage area.
