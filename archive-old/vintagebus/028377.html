Subject: Re: Selling Drakula

No doubt that Bus people are the most Friendly Volk of the hobby--Our problems
are not the example of what the VW Bus Bunch is--to be sure--99.9999% are
cool--but with this cyberspce thing--alot of things can really grow way out of
line--especially thru the use of sending e-mails that cannot be traced---but,
again thru cyberspace sometimes they can!--and what a surprise it is to find out
who is sending you digs , but is not man enough to identify themselves, Magoo
and i are Bus people, and will remain so, and will continue to help when-ever
and where- ever we can--Finding homes for VW Buses is still a lot of fun for
us--we have put together a lot of happy people, that is our reward, keeping
Buses on the road--I'm sure IF Drakula is sold--he will go to a good home--no
matter where it is--and if Drakula is sold--that only opens up another spot in
the garage--
for another VW Bus--and that's what it is all about--remember  TIARFOMB!
and---IILTB, IWFASFI  Enjoy--winner will receive an AridZona Bus Club bus!!
TWWM, uj
