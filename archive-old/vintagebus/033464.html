Subject: Silicon Valley SV2s Campout Aug 17-19

Hey all,

Just wanted to put out the word that the Silicon Valley Chapter of SV2s is 
having their annual campout at Mt. Madonna State Park this August 
17-19th.  Mt. Madonna is located on Hwy 152 at the top of the mountain 
between Highways 1 and 101.  We've got a group campsite reserved for us 
with space for only 7 more buses, so you *need* to RSVP me if you want to 
go.  The first two to reply to me will still fall under our original ten 
(covered by the site fee) and will only be asked for a $15 donation to SV2s 
to help cover the cost of camping.  The five after that should still RSVP 
me, but will have to pay the park $15/night for camping!

I have a flyer up at www.redshift_dot_com/~taylorvw/svt/campout.html with 
pretty much all the information.  If anyone's got questions, please email 
me.  I'll get back to them ASAP.  Come out for a weekend of camping in the 
costal hills with a bunch of other volksfolks!
