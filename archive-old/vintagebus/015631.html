You may be getting sporadic messages from this list; this is normal. 
As the new DNS information trickles out to all the ISP's, the stream of 
messages will grow.

If you've posted to the list in the past few days, and your message was
not bounced, then it's still in limbo on your ISP's mail server.  When 
your ISP's server is able to talk to the list server, your message will
be posted to the list, so you don't need to post again.

***

This is an informational message being sent to all of the subscribers
to the vintagebus and type2 lists, and no reply is necessary.

If you're getting this message, but had previously unsubscribed to
the list, don't fret!  I'm using an archived copy of the list
membership, which you may still be on.  When I update the archive,
you won't get these informational message any more.  Sorry about that...

Thank you for your patience.
