As some of you more experienced (in the Jimi Hendrix sense) list members may recall, there was a thread about the existence of a 'truck' bumper as opposed to a 'bus' bumper. I, and many other listees were of the opinion that this bumper fell into the same category as Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster, much reported but never documented. Well, I am happy to report that I have been to the mountain and seen the creature first hand. This miraculous siting took place at the much overrated International Bus Meet. This was a SOTO event soon to be forgotten by all who attended (even that poor unfortunate who drove all the way from Yakima).  Listee Harry Houck was also present as a witness. Unlike many sitings of the aforementioned ephemera, Harry was in possession of his digital camera and  his wits and snapped a few pictures of the beast before it disappeared into the woods of Washington State (a buyer for the vehicle sporting the rare creature had flown to Madera explicitly for the opportunity). The truck bumper does exist, it is indeed more squared-off than the bus bumper. I was able to do a side-by-side comparison with the bus bumper on Rosie. They ARE different. I hope that Harry will make the digital pictures available soon for general viewing.
