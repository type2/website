Subject: Listee sticker _at_ OCTO

Hey guys...an update

Saw the sample last night ...they look sweet
He will be delivering 50 of them tonite.  So I will have some ready for OCTO.

I'll be there in the 63EZ Camper.....white, roofrack and grey single wheel trailer in tow.  Stop by and check em out.

For the others not going to OCTO or on the other side of the world...I will post to the list on Monday to take care of anyone that wants me to mail some out.

ps; can someone fwd this to the type2 list for me?
