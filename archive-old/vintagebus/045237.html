&lt;&lt; ey,
 you'll have to forgive me if this is a silly question, i havn't ever heard 
 it mentioned, but here goes...
 last week i had the rear engine tin cover and fresh air hoses off and when i 
 was replacing everything i started thinking... in the hot summer months when 
 the heat wont be used, couldn't the fresh air hoses be left off, and the 
 cooler air blowing out th3e fan shroud be used to lower the temp in the 
 engine compartment?? i would think you could even bend the hoses around and 
 direct the air to cool the tops of the heads. if i had a temp gauge i would 
 give it a try and post the results... but i don't. hint... hint...
 thanks for reading...
  &gt;&gt;

actually the fresh air hoses direct the air to cooling the exhaust, which 
does a good function for the cooling of the motor.  the air blown in the fan 
housing does go over and cool the cylinders and heads- where they have fins!  
If you let the fresh air tubes loose, you will find your engine run hotter.
