&lt;&lt; Didn't realize that was Barb with you, should have introduced myself.
Tristan was with me, my girlfriend.  Funny that we both pulled up to Todd's at
the same time, but Todd (written) instructions had said his house was on the
left, leaving us a bit confused when you pulled up to his house :)&gt;&gt;
Hi Steven,
Yes it was a hoot to see you follow us into Todd's place, it was the first
time for us also.
 
 &lt;&lt;Got a kick out of &quot;40HP please pass&quot; spray painted on the back of your bus
:)  Who needs a damn bumper sticker.&gt;&gt;
          Right it really has helped to keep those faster folks happier.  Have
almost caused an accident or two do to laughter of drivers passing us by,
causing them to weave a bit.  Barb did try to cross out 40 HP and update it to
50HP but that particular paint just dissappeared over the next couple of
months.
 
 &lt;&gt;
          You will really need to push and release the brakes on long steep
hills with stop signs/light at the bottom and to keep control with the
pre-1964 brakes.  These same hills we know can just push dthe pedal and stop
without having to plan ahead so darn much.
 
 &lt;&lt;The bushing I'm talking about is the center steering ... I have two or
three inches of play when I turn my steering wheel.  Clara told me the tie-
rods looked new.  I presume I'm talking the same procedure that Thom just
posted pictures about on his '55?  &gt;&gt;
Yes, Thom just posted those photos on the center pin and bushing replacement.
Often the hardest part of this job is removing the stuck square head bolt in
the forward shift linkage so you can get the linkage out of the way.  Next
would be removing the brass bushing which is not that hard.  You can press
them out like Thom did or drill on two sides of each bushing till it colaspses
a bit easily.
