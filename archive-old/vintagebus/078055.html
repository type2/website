Subject: RE: [VB] Battery hold down

Perusing the archives, someone mentioned to definitely not put in one of
those 'battery mats' under the battery that is supposed to absorb acid, ends
up holding in acid and moisture, yikes.  I think I'll make a nice wooden
platform for the battery to sit on, about 1-3/4&quot; to 2&quot; thickness should do
the trick.   That'll get the battery tall enough that the original strap
will hold it down nicely.  I have read of these OG battery covers, must be
one of the rare of the rare items. Never seen one...

Thanks
Gary
