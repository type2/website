I didn't want to post with out letting him know, but there is a person
here that can supply the bearing pullers for the early boxes.  He also
sells Hazet tools if there are any of those you want.  So you know now and
won't have to whine when he tells you, they are about $200.  Made in
Germany.:)  They are a nice tool to have. For information call Jon Furst
at Foreign Aide 505-255-9417 Tues.-Fri.   They can also supply many
air-cooled parts if you need.
