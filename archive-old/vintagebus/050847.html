Subject: Re: [VB] Ellis- coming out Party... (abridged version)

For those of you having trouble deciphering ellis's whining confession, here's the
abridged version.  Be sure to read all the way to the end.

&gt; I, [...] went WATERCOOLED this week.
&gt; [...] This week I chose to sign my name to documents which lock me into
&gt; [...] a mint condition 1997, one owner, Eurovan Winnebago Camper

&gt; [...]I can defend myself and say that it has 63,400 miles on it, [...]has a

&gt; spethial classifieds and encouraged me to make the call. OK! OK! I HOOKED UP
&gt; with the retired Motorola Engineer who was so ANAL about his van that he had
&gt; indoor-outdoor carpeting squares in his driveway under each tire.
&gt; I even made the previous owners cry at time at which I PAID FOR IT!
&gt; They were so broke-up that they asked me to hang back while they drove away-
&gt; claiming that it was the best for both of us...

Me thinks that all that all the rambling was just a pathetic ruse to throw up a
smoke screen and confuse the jury, in an attempt to try and gain acceptance and
approval by said jury for going watercooled.  Now that the truth is out, Jury, what
say you?  Geeze ellis, that catholic school guilt really rags on ya, talk about
extreemes.

BTW Jim, nice score.  I was afraid at first that you bought another F100 or
something of that ilk.
