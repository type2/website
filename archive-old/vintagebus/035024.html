Hi Gene,
Do not back them off!  During the first few weeks the new shoes will wear 
themselfs into the same curve as the drums inner surfaces.  To keep maximum 
surface area contact between brake shoes to brake drums and thus maximum 
braking, you need to keep the brakes adjusted.  When you install new shoes 
you will need to adjust them two or even three times in the first month if 
you bus is a daily driver.   Eric&amp;Barb
