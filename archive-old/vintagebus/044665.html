I live near Tampa, FL, which gets and stays unbelievably hot throughout the 
year. In all 11 Vw's that I have owned, I have used Castrol. At first I was 
using straight 30, but then switched to 20W-50 Part Synthetic as well as 
using PROLONG. I also found a great Product, Hi-Performance Lucas Heavy duty 
oil Stabilizer, the favorite oil supplement of the American Racing Industry, 
Harley Davidson, blah blah blah. I have found this combination to work 
extremely well, for me. 

        Best wishes,
