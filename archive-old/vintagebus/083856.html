&gt; I tested the ignition switch and it only puts out 10
&gt; volts at terminal 50.

&quot;Only&quot;?  IIRC this is on a '60, right?  It should be
putting out about 6 volts.  Either that or some
ne'er-do-well has surrepetitiously installed a 12 V
battery in your Bus...

&gt; This could be the culprit!

Key question: how many volts was it getting in on
terminal 30?  If only 10 volts were coming in, the
problem is upstream of the ignition switch.

There will always be a little bit of a voltage drop
across the ignition switch, maybe on the order of
0.1 to 0.2 V.  But if there's much more than that,
then something is wrong inside there.

&gt; How does the switch come apart, so I can clean it?

I've never had one apart.  I _think_ the metal cover
may be peened / crimped around the base to hold it on
to the plastic base, but I'm not sure.
