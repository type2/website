I fully agree with the build a good engine and your sound problems diminish.

But if you run into tar or have to use it, there is way to remove it. Get a house painters product called WilBond. This is a liquid sander and will remove just about anything even undercoating. It will leave you with a good paintable surface. Just remember to use it outside or with the biggest fan in your garage window that you can find. Maybe a big fan in every window.
