I have been interested in buying an early split window bus and I have come
across a 63' double door.  ( I think that is what you call them.  Cargo doors
on both driver and passenger side)   I am intrigued over the extra set of
doors on the drivers side.  Can someone tell me how rare this is?  I am also
interested in the value of a bus like this.  Let me describe.  I believe the
bus was a cargo van with no windows down the sides, but someone has put 3
camper ( jealousy window style) on each side.  the panel behind the drivers
seat has been cut out and the front seats look like they are out of a late
ghia.  the interior is basically home style wood paneling screwed to the
walls.  On the up side the bus is mostly rust free.  undercarraige is clean
and the &quot;fender areas&quot; look clean too.  One hole in the floor about 3 inches
in diameter.  Any help on Value, rarity, history, and availability of parts
for restoration on this specific bus would be greatly appreciated.  

PS- The bus is in Michagan, if that makes a difference.

well, That double door (yup that's what people call em with the cargo doors
both sides) if kinda nifty.  Tends to be worth a bit more than the regular
style.  But beware, they have a double floor, for reinforcement, and this
helps catch and hold water and rust out.  Look underneath-- there should be
panels welded in under the regular corregated floor.  

Alot of panels were made into campers, either by companies such as Riviera,
Sundial, etc or by individual people.    In the seventies it was unfortunately
common to cut out the cab partition and also cut the wheel wells (not to
mention shag carpet, extra windows, and painting everything root beer brown.)

I would say look behing the pass. seat for the m code tag, but as the
partition is gone, you are out a luck.

Well, it being solid is important, esp in Michigan where I hear cars
disintigrate in about 5 years due to salting the roads.   Partitions can be
replaced.  What do you want to do with a bus?   Sunday drives?  Picnics?
Summer driver?   Camper? Show car?  Something to tinker with on the weekends?
Do you like this one?   Does it have a good vibe?  Will you give it TLC and
accept it's limitations?  Are there many to choose from?
