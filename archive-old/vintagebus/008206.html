Speaking of glass, anyone know how to replace those seals in a popout
window?  I can take those sun's of guns out, but to shove those two pieces
together afterwards is something special.

Looks to me like a kind of press was used to put the pieces together, but
again... I also discovered that two of the two frames removed was rusted
beyond repair.  Hate to see what the other four look like. :(  Guess it
isNOS for me.
