y'know...


My '66 really was infested!  Probably during its years at the junkyard...and

it wasn't bees or B's, but wasps (not WASPS)....


When removing the upper cabinet for insulation putting and rust-killing, I

found a beautiful mud-hive along with the shattered remains of more.  The

good one went immediately into my studio, right next to the cat skull from

the basement, and my miniature ceramic skull, etc...

those mud daubers are real common in this area.   They look like bees or 
wasps but have real long bodys with the sections connected  by what looks 
like thin black wire. They make those mud nests and the larvae are like worms 
 in there.  Ick.   But I don't think they are evil stingers like 
yellowjackers.  

that '66 was only at the Carter boys junkyard a short time.   Before that it 
spent 6 years in a driveway as a &quot;project that they were going to get to 
soon&quot;  .  Have found several buses  in the PNW from BC to Oregon dangerously 
infested with stingers, though.
