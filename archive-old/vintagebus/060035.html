Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Westfalia Interior 66 year model.

I've owned my SO-42 '66 westfalia for almost four years. During that time I
have tried from time to time to get the two lamps mounted between the
windows on the driver's side to come on with no luck.
Tonight when I pulled in the driveway, the light nearest the driver's seat
was on....I haven't been in the bus in three days, and noone else has been
in it either. I wonder what's up?
