&gt; Chris,
&gt;    I put my stereo speakers in the house where there isn't any road noise,
dust, vibration, etc.
&gt;    If you insist on listening to non-bus noise, here's what I've done in
the past. 6x9 speakers in the base of the DC rear seat because a PO had cut
the holes. A bazooka bass speaker behind the seat where the spare tire
didn't fit anymore and two surface mount tweeters in the upper corners above
the A pillars. No PO'd holes? Swap meet wedge enclosures on the rear floor
under the seat.

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Back on the list for a short while. Where do you folks put your stereo
&gt; &gt; speakers? I am soon to install a CD stereo in my bus and I am not sure
where
&gt; &gt; to put the noise makers.
