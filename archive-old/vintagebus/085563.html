Subject: Re: [VB] getting rid of cut-up VW in California ?

          Having the title is good ! Scrap metal prices are high now , maybe
they
 would pay you ? For a few years  people were charged $200 to scrap a
 vehicle... My local yard is really looking for metal ... (Eureka.CA)
 Lloyd
&gt; &gt; But being in the Peoples Republic I was wondering if there were some
weird
&gt; rules that I do not know of concerning scraping a car,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have the title so that not the problem...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for your ideas
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; DAVE
