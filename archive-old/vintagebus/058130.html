Nope.  

Just called them and the lowest they have is a 5400 RPM.  Said they have not
seen a 4500 RPM in a long time, whatever that means?

&gt; For all you T1 lead foots:
&gt;
&gt; 4500RPM cut out.  Limited supply.
&gt;
&gt; Contact this man:
&gt; Gilbert S. Chan
&gt; gschan_at_email_dot_com
&gt; Manila, Philippines
&gt;
&gt; Ships from the Philippines.  But payment is sent to his brother in El
&gt; Segundo, CA.
&gt;
&gt; Kind of odd but it works :)  Seems like a really nice fellow.
&gt;
&gt; For T4 motors John at aircooled_dot_net carries a full line of 5400RPM and up.
