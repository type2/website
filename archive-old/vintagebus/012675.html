I am working on a bus that had the same seat belt through the post job done to it.  They did take the time to put a 3 inch washer on first, so there is (was) a 3 inch diameter by 1/4 inch deep crater from them cranking down on the bolt.  Now that that is fixed it is on to the 3 foot long window hole cut in the side of the bus.
