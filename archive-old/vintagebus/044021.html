They will start going out in tomorrows mail!
That's about 5 days earlier than I thought I'd get them from the printer.
That also means that I will have some copies available for both the Type I
and Type II manuals at the Puyallup Oktobugfest the 17th.
:)
Thanks to all who have shown interest...I feel confident that you'll be
very excited about having one or both of these!
later
