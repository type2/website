Subject: Re: [VB] On Balence


Could you post the brand/name of the tire machine?  Might help to be able to 
ask specifically when looking around...

&gt;I just checked with my local family run tire store in the little town where
&gt;I live in West, Central Ohio.  He has an adaptor that he can use on all
&gt;wheel types including ours.  It is a modern deal that came with his tire
&gt;machine.  It will adjust infinitely to any lug nut pattern and will fit on 
&gt;a
&gt;modern balencing machine.  If we have one in a town of 8000 I bet other 
&gt;tire
&gt;shops do too...I would keep calling until I found one.  I would bet that 
&gt;the
&gt;big &quot;get-em-in-and-out&quot; shops would not have one but the old family run
&gt;independant shops might be more inclined to have something like that.
