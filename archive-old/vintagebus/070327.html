Hi Joe,
Probably alot of the hop is from your extra HP, and only keeping a ginger 
foot on will solve most of that.  At least some can be from shocks and whimpy 
tires not rated for at least 1525 Lbs..
  Our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion came with KYB gas shocks and 
once we got properly rated tires we greatly reduced the sway in corners and 
eleminated the sudden automatic lane switches when encountering side winds 
and when being passed by semis.
  Our 1963 SC still had the OG shocks from the factory and they still worked, 
but were not good enough even after we replaced the bug 1200 Lbs. rated tires 
we were using up till then.  We installed KYB gas adjust shocks which are 
stiffer than the basic KYB gas shocks and this also took care of quite a bit 
of the swaying and automatic lane switching problems.  Now rides like it is 
on rails when loaded, instead of picking up oscillations from cement pavment 
sections at high speeds and swaying up/down front to rear like a ship in high 
waves!
