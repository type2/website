 now that i live in a stink-hole big city, the 70 needs to pass
emissions... and it didn't. here are the results:
HC in PPM - high rpm  :    MAX  500   my bus - 60
at idle :  MAX 500  my bus 852
 CO in %   -  high rpm    :  MAX  4.20  my bus  - .26
at idle : MAX 5.5    my bus  .20

-----------------------------------------------------------------

HC is hydrocarbons: fuel that is burned.
CO is carbon monoxide. Too little CO and the engine misfires because it is too lean, HC goes sky high. Too
much CO and the engine is too rich and the HC goes sky high.

At .20 CO at idle, you are way too lean. You need to get the CO up to 2 to 2.5%, that will bring the HC down.
Either you have a massive vacuum leak or your carb is way screwed up.
