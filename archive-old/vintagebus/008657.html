Hey gang,

I haven't seen it in person but the seller did send me a pair of pics that I
can send to anyone interested.  The rear wheel wells are cut out, and what
the seller describes as a &quot;rollbar in the bed&quot; looks to be one of the hoops
for the canopy.  Also has safari's.  Don't contact me unless you want me to
send you the pics he sent me.  There's contact info in the ad.
