Hi Clara,
The problem is that oil is liquid.  Try putting oil in a glass jar, then pour
in a little water.  Come back later and the water will be on the bottom.  If
oil did such a great job then we could just oil up bare metal and not have
rust in years.  Plus the mess that just a little oil will make of your
windows visability during rains is not pleasant.  We also tried grease in the
seals, silicon sealant, 3M body sealant and a few others that all failed in
less than a year.  Roofing tar has worked with no leakage for over six years
so far.

hm, you have a point there.  but the oiling does make it so easy to slip the
seal on the glass.    Guess it makes sense to use oil all the way around and
roofing tar at the bottom edge and corners, which is what I usually do.   I
use WD-40 and clean rags to clean up oil and roofing tar after a windsheild
job and it works really well, w/o nasty fumes.    Cause of course the stuff
gets on the glass and around elsewhere as well.       Then soapy water and
/or glass cleaner.   Sometimes I even wax the windsheild, which definately
helps rain running off and helps visibility.   If the stuff oozes out later I
just pull out the WD-40 and clean rag and clean it again.
