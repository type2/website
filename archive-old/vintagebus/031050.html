&gt; One more check that I know a lot of people here use.  Could you hold your
&gt; dipstick after a good long drive???  If so, I'd think again about your
&gt; &quot;overheating&quot; problem.


In a Quest for real numbers,, I purchased an infared heat tracer thermometer 
I can take the temps of things like engine sump , and heads, but it is
interesting to see that the block is hotter on the side opposite to the dipstick
the oil galley near the dist is usually the hottest area 
Now,, I wish I wrote down the data!!!

Until now, I have just used it as a comparison test,, when we carabused to
EveryBus, I measured all the engines in the group at a gas stop.. 
Last year we were all about 190 deg F  [ t4 measured at the oil pump ] one was
210 degF and one was 180 degF
and the only T1 engine was about the same

This year, more folks in the test group,, most were about 210 deg F and some
were about 240 degF  and the T1 engine pulling a trailer was about 240 degF

Later I checked Doc Ric as he felt his camper engine was overheating,, His T1
engine was about 245 iirc, and dropped to about 210 while it was running to cool
off in the parking lot..

This is unscientific,, but I have a way to tell if I have overheated or not,,
tooo late for any defensive action that an idiot light / gauge would have given
me.  
But when i think i am loosing performance,, when I stop,, i make a quick temp
check.. compare it to the others with me,, and i can get a perspective.. 

I also use the infared to check live electricity,, looking for hot spots in the
connections etc. up to 16 kV power lines, so the cost of the infared is
justified .. they are on line auctions for about $100us
