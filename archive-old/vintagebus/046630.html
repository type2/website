Ive seen two on ebay in the last six months sell just shy of 400$.
I think one was 380$ and the other was 386$

&gt; A girl in my little farming town just bought a 58 kombi.  The bus is solid
&gt; and complete.  It even has the rear bumper splash pans!  Anyway, I happened
&gt; to notice that she has ambulance fans and after close inspection they were
&gt; indeed and in mint condition to boot!  I told her that they would make a
&gt; perfect addition to the 57 deluxe and she agreed to sell me them.  Now I 
told
&gt; her I'll give her my cover so she still has something there but I could not
&gt; decide on a price.  She knows absolutely nothing about the prices for such
&gt; parts.  I just need to know a low reasnable price that we would both be hapy
&gt; with.  Im not interested in taking advantage of another Bus enthusiast.

I just got a set from VWHoward that were *very* close to mint for $200.00
I can say that I am very happy with them and the price. The only thing  they
needed was some detailing on the knob and some lube on the fans. They are now
working well in my Crew...................................
