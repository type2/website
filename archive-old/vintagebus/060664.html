Subject: Re: [VB] removing axles from splitcase tranny?

Thanks Ronnie (and Jon who pmailed),

I actually want to remove the axles so that I can
fit the original barney reduction boxes - they're
sorta split around the springplate
(like a kubel...).

I must admit I have immediately assumed the axles
would have to be changed cos the barney reduction
boxes look so different ..... 

Can anyone tell me if this is actually the case?
Or are the axles the same in a barn and the 'later'
post 54 splitcase tranny?

Sorry for all the questions - this is the first
barn I've owned and I've never actually worked on one before....
-  I'm a bit short on reference material at the moment too...

Thanks

RobK


&gt;   If I remember right you will have to split the trans and remove the
axles
&gt; and carrier together, There is a set pin that keeps the inner axle
tension
&gt; nut from coming loose. They are a real PITA to work on, thus the high
prices
&gt; from the people that do, I have be quoted from trans shops that will even
&gt; touch anywhere from 400 to 700 dollars LABOR ONLY.
