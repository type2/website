BTW, the carb adapters suck!  You can get them to work nicely but you need
to grind them and polish them to get them to fit and look nice.  The
castings are horrid
&gt;&gt;&gt;

Ive only had 2 of them, both old, never a new one. But the castings are
clean and smooth and they work fine.
There is nothing to them Its hard to see how they would get it done badly.
