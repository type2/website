Hi Guys,

Florida is in the middle of another hurricane, so I've had the whole day to
sit around and watch down pours.  Yesterday, I finally bought myself a MIG
welder to perform various maintenance on the single cab. The first item up
for bid is the cargo door and forward hinge passengers side. The area
holding the forward hinges for both the gate and the door is badly rotted.
Looks like I'll have to fabricate this area cause I haven't seen a
reproduction piece. I'll probably re-enforce the inside edge with angle
steel and then fabricate an outer shell to resemble the original body line.
While watching the rain and trying to keep myself busy, I began plans of my
roof rack using the MIG. When I purchased the welder from Lowe's, I noticed
the conduit used to create many racks.  This is great stuff, as it is
inexpensive and extremely sturdy for aluminum.
My question:
How does one bend the tubing to create perfect arches for corners and
ladders?


Thanks.

Tom
