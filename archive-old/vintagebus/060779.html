Subject: Re: [VB] disc brake kit &amp; update mater cylinder

If you step on the brakes do things fly forward?  They should, with a good 
stock 65 brake system. (warn any passengers first)

I thought the 68-69 front beam fits a split, but the 70/later didn't, though 
you could put the later brakes on the earlier bay beam.  But then you have 
that squishy ball joint ride.

and
 have any suggestions.  I want strong brakes 
 I also wonder if changing  the front beam could improve the handling ?&lt;&lt;
 
 John,
 I think listmember Adrian Pillow from Georgia was going to attempt a beam 
swap
 from a 75 to his 66 about a year and a half ago. Hey Adrian, did you try that
 beam swap?
