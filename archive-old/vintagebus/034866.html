 It was in the 90's, windy, so I went downtown about 5 miles.  When it
 hit 120 deg I checked it and the louvers were open.  It got up to about
 180deg - good operating temp.  It sat downtown at a block party for an
 hour, then it restarted great and I headed for the freeway.  Through
 town the temp headed for 180 again, then 2 miles down the freeway,
 slight down hill, wind behind us, it climbed to 200 deg.
 
 I have not taken it uphill yet, maybe this morning.

this does not sound as though it is overheating.  What temp will it do on 
flat road on the freeway after 20 minutes?   I am happy if my oil temp is 210 
or below.   

Having the thermostat installed WILL make the engine temp climb rapidly to 
about 170 to 180 F, cause that is what it is designed to do.

when going through town my motor does about 80 C (~180F) and on the freeway 
it usually climbs somewhat, depending on outside temp and driving conditions.

In the SW desert, the oil temp tended to stabilise at 100C on the freeway at 
~60mph, unless I was pulling a hill.   If I drove 50-55 it ran a bit cooler   
Hope this is useful for comparison.
