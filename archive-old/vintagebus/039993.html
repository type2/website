OK, this will be my last post on this topic.

&gt;&quot;If VW disappeared in a puff of smoke *today*, what effect could it
&gt;*possibly* have on the vintage VW community, other than being a topic
&gt;for endless debate on this list and other online forums? Let's see:
&gt;
&gt;The drying up of parts sources?  Nope.&quot;

I got a 009 off the shelf from a local dealer 2 summers ago!

&gt;&quot;Sudden disappearance of funding for VW events?  Nope.
&gt;The loss of support for ACVW clubs &amp; websites?  Nope.&quot;

I guess you've never heard of the Toledo Vintage Volkswagen Club's show in 
Auburn Hills, Michigan at Volkswagen of America Headquarters

&gt;&gt;&quot;If anything, it would be a GOOD thing, because then all the VW sites 
&gt;&gt;could flourish unfettered without nastygrams from the law firm of Dewey, 
&gt;&gt;Cheatham and Howe (actually nixon something, but you know...)&quot;

hmmm, we actually agree here... this IS total bullsh#t!

&gt;&gt;&quot;For those with a die-hard loyalty to the brand, and pledge the purchase 
&gt;&gt;of NB's and NM's, there is no more link between your love of vintage VW's 
&gt;&gt;and the new versions than there is between broccoli and marshmallow 
&gt;&gt;sauce.&quot;

you and your analogies, your so clever. BUT, that is COMPLETELY ignorant. 
why do you think it is completely impossible for someone to like water 
cooled VWs as much as air cooled? this is where you fail to realize that 
everyone does not have feelings like you... so what do you do, bash them. i 
like to drive my passat as much as i like to drive my bus. i put 6700 miles 
on my bus last summer (april - september) and loved every one of them. but, 
when Fall comes, i gotta put the bus away. what about simply having loyalty 
to a QUALITY PRODUCT?

&gt;&gt;&quot;The VW loyalists remind of teeny boppers who latch onto the celeb du 
&gt;&gt;jour, ie n-sync, back door boys, britney spearme, etc.&quot;

another rude and demeaning comparison. what do you mean by this? &quot;loyalists&quot; 
who... water cooled loyalists? have you ever even driven a watercooled VW? 
and im not talking about a POS Fox, im talking about a 16 valve GTI or 
Scirocco or ANYTHING with the VR6 or 1.8T? they are fun as hell to drive!

&gt;&gt;&quot;Blind worship with no real inkling what's behind the manufactured facade, 
&gt;&gt;yet they plaster their rooms with posters, buy the tickets, and deck 
&gt;&gt;themselves out with the appropriate licensed merchandise. The VW loyalists 
&gt;&gt;swoon to anything bearing the magic symbol.&quot;

this comment takes the cake... so, what YOUR saying is, people like me are 
like Volkswagen robots? just buying up all the VW s#it we can get our hands 
on, with no common sense to determine anything for ourselves. if we were 
debating this in person and you said that to me, i would punch you right in 
the face!

i like this list and all the diverse people on it. everyone has their own 
opinion and are polite about it. everyone has always been helpful to me. 
BUT, i cant believe you people can continue to listen to thom spew his 
opinionated, hurtful propaganda and not say anything about it. SO, thats why 
i do!! its just like his hippie and hemp ramblings.

thanks for reading,
