 I have to say that the Berg shifters do shift real nice.  They do worry
me though.  The bus ones are a big old handle on a big lever.  It seemed
to me that the shifter was constantly putting some tension on the rod from
the weight.  You would have a better chance of jamming up things with the
longer shifter with a longer throw.  Berg's instructions say absolutely no
power shifting with their shifter.  I don't think most of us mind that.
Anyway I took mine off after a few weeks.  I can't give you any tests to
prove that it puts more stress on things, it's just my gut feeling.  I'll
sell you mine if you want a Berg shifter for 61 up. They are very well
made and they do shift real nice.
