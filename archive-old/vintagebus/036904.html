Hi NQ,
Would be interesting to take a look at some 72 type 4 bus stock carbs.  
Especially the venturi size of them.   We have been wondering about using 
early 40 HP carbs.  Since they were engineered for 1200cc two of them should 
work well on a 2000cc engine.  We think the 34 PICT-4 would be too big, 
unless you are planning on drag race instead of driving long distances.
