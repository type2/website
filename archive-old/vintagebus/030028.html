Subject: looking for a rest stop

ok - it's friday  so ....

We are looking for a friendly driveway/yard in the walking vicinity
(since parking at the convention center is such a zoo $$) of Disneyland
to park our 59 ddr w/t ez camper (bus content).  We are looking at
attending a national square dance at the convention center at the end of
June next year so we were wondering if there was anyone in the area
willing to lend us a camping spot and use of a shower (you would not
want us parked near you if we did not shower after dancing 12 hours a
day).

Willing to trade bus or computer work but will have to negotiate a time
for that as this will be a short stop between family reunions in OK and
OR.  (nothing like a direct route.)

TIA
