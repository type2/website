Sorry about this tire post, as I know the topic is making folks nauseous by
now :-)
and my congrats to NQ for finding those perfect new shoes for his ride...
I've made a pledge to myself that if I can find the right tire for my truck,
I will personally lick the protective coating off the white walls. This will
be my debt of gratitude to the tire gods.

I'm considering the 195 75 14  Bridgestone Dueler A/T 693
http://www.firestonetireandauto_dot_com/at693.htm
&quot;For the adventurous driver searching for a balance between refined highway
driving and off-road performance, the Bridgestone Dueler A/T has it all. The
Dueler A/T lets you conquer both worlds..without compromising the comfort of
a civilized ride. A large, deep (13/32&quot;-16/32&quot;) tread block design serves a
dual purpose-combining all-season highway performance with outstanding
off-road traction. The sleek styling features your choice of raised outline
white letters or serrated black letters.&quot;

They cost approx. $310 for a set of four, delivery included. $77.50 each
These are light truck tires with a weight rating about 1400lbs per tire..

Anyone have these?
Comments?
Like the outlined white letters?
Why does my spell check prefer transsexuals over transaxles?
