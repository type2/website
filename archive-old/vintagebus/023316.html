I just dealt with this on a '59 Bug that was off the books.  I had some
clear black plates to go with it, too, but not a stitch of paperwork.  I
had to take it down to the DMV office and have them verify the VIN number,
and they *would* have let me keep the old plates on the car if I'd had
something, anything showing that they were originally regitered on the car.
 Alas, I didn't, so I had to go with white plates for now (Until I get a
set of YOM plates).  There really seems to be a LOT of variation in how the
DMV handles these old car transactions, but it DOES seem like in your case,
with the right DMV employee, you should be able to keep your original plates.

&gt;AFAIK, you have to put new plates on the car, but _DON'T_ give them your
&gt;old plates!  If you take the old plates in they will want to confiscate
&gt;them (that's what the regs tell them to do), but if you don't have them
&gt;with you (you lost them, right?) they will just give you the new plates.
&gt;Then, after YOM plates are OK'd by the next bill, you will be able to
&gt;switch back.
