Subject: Re: [VB] A piece of busfullness

I have the rubber drain tubes on both battery trays of my 67 DC.  And
when I took out the gas tank to rehab it two years ago, I was surprised
to also find two additional drain tubes (or what was left of them) in
the gas tank compartment.

&gt;    On removing the rear bumper of a 67 Sundial (probally the nicest OG one I
&gt; have ever seen) there was a bracket between the 8 mm bolt and the little 4
&gt; mm bolt holding on the splash pans to the body. In all my years of busdome
&gt; this is the first time I have ever seen this little bracket. Another thing
&gt; that is there that I have never seen is a rubber drain tube on the driver
&gt; side battery? tray. Always learning new bits.
