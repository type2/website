&gt; I don't know if the smallest Lycoming 4 cylinder would be right in line with type 1 since it is 180 hp _at_ 2700 rpm:

Well, that one is the IO-360-M1B.  The &quot;360&quot; is the displacement in cubic
inches, so it is a wee bit larger than a VW.

There are smaller engines such as the Lycoming O-235 (115HP) and
Continental O-200 (100HP).  Other engines are smaller still, but not in
production.  That's why our beloved VW engines find their way onto the
noses of airplanes!
