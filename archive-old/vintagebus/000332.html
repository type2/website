  Heres the deal, on the '62 my wiper blades dont go
 high enough for me. When drivin in the rain w/ the
 wipers on, I have to duck way down to get where I can
 see. (have to duck a little anyways, Im 6'3&quot;)

get stock bus blades, they are longer than bug blades which are often on 
buses.  You see the bug blades are cheaper.  A friend who drove my bus in the 
rain didn't have any complaints about the wipers, just the auto shut off 
headlight when you go over a bump (he's 6'6&quot; and his knee would hit the 
headlight knob)  Maybe you dont have stock wiper arms either hm.  I wonder if 
anyone has pics they can send.
