I'd be more than happy to.  I will email it to you tomorrow.  The pix are at 
my house.  Also do you know the following Binz owners? Scott ?, Tallahassee, 
Fl, Lorn ?, West of Tallahassee, Fl, Kevin at Busbones, Ocala, FL.  Sorry 
I've forgotten their last names.  If you want to contact any of these 
individuals, let me know.  Good Luck! Drive 'Em

&gt;
&gt;I couldn't quite make out the serial number on the Binz photos you had 
&gt;posted
&gt;on the VW Planet.  I was wondering if you could send them too me?  I have a
&gt;Binz and am trying to track all the remaining models out there.
