Oh boy, that's what I want, Ethanol running around in my hot engine
compartment. You should have posted this last week with the fire extinguisher
posts!

Hello everyone,

Recently at work I've been attempting to cool down cadaver tendons to 0
degrees celcius so that we can do tension testing with them.   Turns out
that the tendons get stiffer at that temp, and can support a greater tension
load than they can at room temp.  This has no application in real life, but
it does have an application for the bus list.  Keep reading, I'll get there
I promise.

The tendons are placed inside a jaw like clamp that has serrated edges on
it.  Clamps similar to this have been cooled in other studies using liquid
nitrogen, or liquid carbon dioxide.  Both work very well, but it is
difficult to avoid temperature spikes due to freeze/thaw cycles.  We're
using piezoelectric chips to cool down the clamps, basically the same things
that power the coleman travel chests. The key to making the cold side
coooooooold is to move the heat away from the hot side.  This is typically
accomplished in the coleman coolers with a fan.  We've been using compressed
air passed over a copper heat sink, since we've got wall air in the lab.
Shrouding on the sides of the sink controls where the air flows and helps
make sure we get the most convective heat transfer possible.  Beginning to
see how this relates to the ACVW???

I've been fooling around with different variables, trying to optimize the
cooling and get the temps as low as I can.  Some of those variables include:
air pressure, air flow rate, humidity of the cooling air, temperature of the
cooling air, and most recently the chemical content of the cooling air.  I
found that the most efficient way to cool the thing down was to pass low
pressure cooled air with a high humidity over the fins.  That of course
sounds intuitive.  But the fun stuff started happening when I started
humidifying the air with ethanol rather than water.  That got me thinking...
  I'm envisioning a couple of swamp cooler mats that mount inside the engine
compartment behind the vents.  The ethanol source of your choice is
percolated through the mats with a pump, so that all the air entering the
cooling fan is high in ethanol content.  I'd have to do some math on it, but
from what I've learned with my simple lab system you could probably drop
head temps a bit with such a system.

Whether or not it's worth it, I dunno.  I prolly won't ever build it either
since I don't know if the benefit/bullshit ratio is high enough.  I'd have
to do some math, and some testing in the bus.  But just the thought of
pulling off the road every couple hundred miles at the local liquor store
and picking up a couple bottles &quot;for the bus&quot; struck me as kinda fun.

FWIW,
