No, they're not barndoor.  They're 60&gt; European spec assymetric bus headlights.

And barndoor lights are not barndoor-specific; they're pre-60 european
symmetrical headlights.

US buses had sealed-beam.

I don't know the reasoning behind the switch to assymetrical. And I could be
wrong on the &quot;60&quot; part, but it's pretty close.

There's one other style I've seen, with a curved lensign, and were 
different for the right and left side.

Another note: I've seen a lot of &quot;sets&quot; of these FS, where both lights
are the *same* side, as identified by the lensing and the drain hole.
You can't really use them like that, as you'll have some wacky headlights.  
A couple of the KP vendors had these mis-matched sets, although they displayed 
them as if they were a correct set, to snare the unwary buyer.
