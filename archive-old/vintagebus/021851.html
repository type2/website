&gt;I'm on the everlasting search for a set of 15x6 Fuchs wheels for my bus. I
saw a nice set at a killer price last week at a local shop...went back 2
days later to buy them...they were gone. :-\ $240 for the set. Derrick

At $240 a set I am surprised they lasted 2 hours!  You should have chopped
off your pinky as collateral :)  Assuming they were real Fuchs?

From my experiences they run about $200 each for great condition ones at
good wheel shops.  Street price for used by owner is usually about $500-$600
a set.

I have seen repo Fuchs for much less money and are basically crap compared
to the real ones, but much cheaper and perfectly suitable for bus
driving/use.  The Fuchs were the first forged aluminum wheel on a production
car and are lighter and much much stronger than regular cast aluminum
wheels.  There is a fox head symbol on the back of the real Fuchs, so be
sure to check for this if you are paying for the real thing.  Also the real
Fuchs are anodized aluminum so they have a semi dull look to them even when
clean, the proper way to clean them is with Vaseline jelly.  Apply the
Vaseline and rub it in and let it sit a day and then do it again, it will
look much better but still not shiny.  If they are polished the anodizing is
gone and if they are dull will need re-polished and clear coated...  Very
time consuming or expensive if someone else does it.

A lot of people want to slap these of their busses, but do not realize how
expensive a good set can be to become show quality.  The repos will be much
cheaper, just as functional, and much easier to polish (since it is softer
cast aluminum).   Plus I am sure you know that these will not bolt up to the
VW wide five pattern...?  You will need to drill new drums on all four sides
or get an expensive conversion kit... Maybe even shorten the axles in the
rear?  I do not think the adapter plates will work because the offset is too
far out for a bus and will rub in the rear.

You may also want to consider the phone dial wheels or the cookie cutters.
Both stock Porsche 15&quot;x6&quot;or 5.5&quot; wheels and will fit the same.  These are
cast aluminum and very easy to come by.  I think street by owner for a set
is about $300-$400.  Most Porsche people do not want these wheels in favor
of the Fuchs.

If you are west coast try www.partsheaven_dot_com or east coast
http://www.pap-parts_dot_com/.  Go to www.pelicanparts_dot_com for some great advice
and some classified stuff.

The 15&quot;x5.5&quot; BRM repo wheels just keep looking better and better ;)  Sorry
to be a downer on this, it is just a lot of work.
