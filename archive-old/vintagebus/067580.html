Subject: more heat questions

I got the procat the other day...it works pretty good, considering we are
having having one of the coldest january's in over a hundred years. but it
smelled really bad. And as per suggestions I let it run outside for over an
hour before using it inside. Then I used a whole tank with it,and it still
smelled terrible up until I ran out of gas.

I am thinking back to the stewart warner...How do I know the model I am
looking at is for a bus or a bug...the seller does not know.

this is the info I got
&quot;this a 6 volt gas heater vwoa model zvw 256-201. stewart-warner corp. model
8332&quot;

thanks for any help deciphering this.
