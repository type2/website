Subject: Trailer to PNW from SoCal or nearby?

Hi all,

I am getting ready to purchase a VW in the Seattle area and am wanting
to see if anyone is in a position to bring it south toward LA. Open
trailer, car dolly, whatever. I don't need anything fancy.

I am also not in a rush to get it. It runs and drives, but needs minor
items that are currently preventing me from doing the &quot;fly &amp; drive&quot;
thing.

Thanks in advance,

~Rich
