Man,  Now I've finally seen enough splitts to keep me happy for a good
while.  Drove up to the shows with SV2s a very cool group,  saw the OCTO
show,  got some cute girls to pose in front of my bus for a picture, 
LOST my brakes completely sat. afternoon driving down to Irvine Lake, 
fixed the brake problem,  camped at the lake with 30  or so splitts, 
went to the Classic got some cool parts ( no bikini contest?) ,  and then
cruised home.  While in Irvine this weekend everywhere we drove we seemed
to always have a small following of vintage buses.  Bus people are
cool........  jon    65 Sundial
