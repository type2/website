Subject: Re: [VB] PLF highroof accident 

I agree with the disagree...  I've been driving up and down the I-5 for
30 years, at all hours; I never give it a second thought. I do 62 mph in
the right lane, occasionally passing slower traffic, and this doesn't
count the dozens of times I 've driven from CA to NY over the years. Maybe
I've been lucky, who knows.

&gt; VW's do have less sheet metal in front but that only helps you in a front
&gt; end collision. Also, American and Jap cars only started adding reinforcement
&gt; to side panels in the last few years.
