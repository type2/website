Hey All-

Ran into a problem with my 65 bus the other day. The bus is quite stock =
bus save for 12 volt 1600 DP.

Problem was this- drove bus for about an hour- pulled over to buy gas and =
shut motor off. Upon starting motor up again noticed that starter appeared =
turn over slower than usual (attributed this to my somewhat undercharged =
battery the result of the bus sitting in the garage for too long).

Pulled over again approximately 15-20 minutes later to get a bite to eat. =
When I came out to turn the key over to start the bus up again- NOTHING!. =
No slow turn over, no click, absolutely nothing. However tried wipers, =
lights horn etc etc. they all still work fine however nothing with engine =
turn over.=20

As luck would have it I chose to park across the street from a Canadian =
Tire (kinda like a Pep Boys of the north) which fortunately sells car =
batteries.

I bought the most powerful battery that they sold thinking that the =
battery might be dead and proceeded to lug it back to my car and install. =
With visions of the engine springing to life I returned to the drivers =
seat to start it up and... NOTHING!

Now I am really miffed- I decide to mull over my options and finish my =
lunch. After letting the engine cool down some and approximately 20 =
minutes have elapsed I decide to try again... the engine springs to life =
like there was never a problem ?!?!?!

So to all that are still reading- what do you think the cause of this =
problem is

Door Number 1- old wiring and associated voltage drop from battery to =
ignition and back (pretty sure Muir wrote about his &quot;Ford&quot; fix for this)

Door Number 2- flaky ignition with short?

Door Number 3- issue with starter motor (note that i never actually turned =
motor manually after it cut out- so everything was in the exact same =
position save for the new batter)- the only other variable that changed =
was the expiry of time).

Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated I don't care for a repeat =
performance!
