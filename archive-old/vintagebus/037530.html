&lt;&lt; Hey all,
 
 I'm getting tired of not being able to open the passenger door for my gal 
 when we take a ride in my 63 Camper.  Does anyone make a passenger door 
 handle with a key tumbler, even if it's repro?
  &gt;&gt;
ya- it's called a drivers door handle.    You just put on on the passenger 
side.
