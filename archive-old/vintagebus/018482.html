Subject: generator pulley

well driving down the road today and the generator lights comes on...i am
figuring on having to replace a fan belt....but when i go to look at the
engine-the generator pulley has apparently sheared off. any idea what could
have caused this? Can I just replace the pulley or will i need to put a new
generator in?
It looks like just the pulley towards the fornt of the bus has sheared, the
one towards the rear was still on the shaft securely?
I had the bus towed to a friends garage...but by the time i got there it was
late too dark to work on the bus... i need to wait until friday. hopefullly i
can find a pulley and pop it it pretty easily.

happy thanksgiving everyone...for those of you with campers-ever try turkey
dinner in the bus?
