Subject: [VB] Heating a VW with Oil!
Message-ID: &lt;19991105234433.25995.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

List:

It is almost winter time and I am not looking foreward to driving aroung and 
shivering in my Baja Bug again.

Because of the type of exhaust I am using, I can't use heater boxes. I don't 
want the expese and weight of a gas heater so there seems to be only one 
other choice for warming up the interior.

The hot oil treatment. I was wondering if anyone had installed an oil cooler 
inside their VW and put a fan behind it to heat their Bug. I remember some 
company offering a kit to do this but it seems sorta cheesy.

It seems like a logical idea. It could work like a heater core in one of 
those crazy water cooled cars.
