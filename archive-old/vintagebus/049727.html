Subject: Let Us Raise a Toast

On next weekend the Josh Rogers Memorial Beer Bash and Campout will be held
in Oklahoma.  I will not be able to attend that event due to the distance
and the time it would take to get there.  However I will on next Saturday
evening at 12 midnight EST raise a glass of good beer (there was no bad
beer in Josh's blue eyes) in memory of my good friend and VW colleague.
Josh Rogers was a good fellow and I think if I were dead and gone he would
raise a toast to me.

This year seems to have brought a lot of tragedy to many of the members of
this cyber community.  That is simply how life happens, as cruel as it
seems.  We can only pray for it to affect us in a way that motivates us to
create positive change.

Josh was lost in loves broken dreams when he committed his act of self
demise.  He, I am sure, did not intend to hurt anyone with his selfish
action, but he did.  I must say I was dissappointed with the decision he
made, but I could never be critical of it.  He will live on in my memory as
a man that gave a damn about the fellow standing beside him no matter who
it was.  One can nover question the motive of a man that good to harshly.
You simply have to accept what he did and go on with your life.

I don't know how heavy he felt the night he died, maybe he felt it was his
only choice.  Maybe he felt he had no other course of action.  Love between
man and woman has a way of moving us to do things we would not normally do,
good and bad.

Anyway, next Saturday evening I will raise my glass.  If you would like to
join me please do so.  It doesn't need to be beer per sae.  You could raise
a glass of tea, or coffee, or just plain good water.

Thanks,

Charlie Ford

Its so hard to come by that feeling of peace.....This friend of mine said
&quot;Close your eyes and try a few of these.&quot;  I thought I was flying like a
bird, so far above my sorrow, but when I looked down I was standing on my
knees.
