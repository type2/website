&gt; Can anyone tell me if a late 60's Porsche engine (I don't mean type 4) will

Wouldn't a &quot;late 60's&quot; Porsche engine be a 2.xL 911 engine?  Oh wait, it
could be a 912 - forgot about that.

&gt; I have a 64 bus but I have no good engine (rod through the case). Buying the bus
&gt; cleaned me out so it's on blocks until I save the funds to build myself a top
&gt; quality 1600dp. In the meantime, I would love to drive this bus. I've had no
&gt; luck in scrounging up a VW engine for free, but... yes, an offer of a genuine
&gt; Porsche engine. Who would have guessed? Too bad I don't have a Porsche. Do you
&gt; think I use it until I build an engine that doesn't require $900 parts?

Beware of free gifts.  If someone is *giving* you a 356/912 engine, you may
be in for more expense than if you just bucked up and spent the cash on a good
VW engine.   The 356 engines are MUCH more expensive to fix than the VW ones,
simply because of that magical &quot;P&quot; word.   I know people have run these
engines in buses, but I'm not intimate with the conversion.
