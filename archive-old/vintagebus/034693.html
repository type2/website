&lt;&lt; Bentley Manual calls for 1/2 a U.S. pint. If you fill them to the brim you 
will have gear oil leaking out of your seals and axel boots. &gt;&gt;
Hi Virge,
Yes, and like we said then you fill the center section which in turn fills 
the axle tube and thusly completely fills the reduction boxes.  
 
&lt;&lt;If you dont take my advice and &quot;Go for it&quot; I would like to hear how your 
seals and boots hold up. Let me know. I just did the entire process and my 
RGB are a little loud.&gt;&gt;
Better fill them quick!  We have been doing this for over 250,000 miles of 
bus driving and only had leaks at the axle seals when the bearing gave out or 
when the axle boots cracked open! 
The only way to get a tranny to leak by overfilling is to flood the center 
section too full and this will make the rear tranny input shaft seal leak 
like a sieve.  Eric&amp;Barb
