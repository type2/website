 &gt; Need to ask the list: How do I get this old bushing off. The rubber is 
long 
 &gt; rotted off but that steel bushing is stuborn as hell to get off of there. 
A 
 &gt; friend suggested a hammer and chisel. Is this an area that can take a lot 
of 
 &gt; pounding? hate to bend that stud or worse yet break it off. Please advise.
 
 hello,
 
 I have run into this before myself...
 
 what i have tried...
 
 if the bushing is a &quot;split&quot; type (has a seam in it) drive a chisel into
 that seam and expand it, then the thing will come right off...
 
 Heat it up with a torch, spray it with penetrating oil, and put vise grips
 on it and try to get it moving.  Yank on vise grips to try and twist it,
 or hit vise grips with a hammer to move it off...
  &gt;&gt;
take a grinder and grinder a flat spot on one side.

spray penetrating lube liberally.

attach vise grips and twist.

the heat till hot and squirt water method never hurts.

should come off.

grease the studs when installing new shocks.  grease is good.  your bus loves 
to be greased.   grease grease grease.  this is the grease mantra. grease...

Clara
