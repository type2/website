All,
	I Pmailed Markus Benne suggesting Costco's LT 195/75/14 tires under the
Kirkland label.  They are made by Michelin and are the same tire (I
think?) as the Michelin LTX tires.  They have a 60,000 mile warrenty. 
To buy these tires you must join Costco, $40, and I paid $49 per tire
plus all of the extras costs...  The final cost was less than what I
would have had to pay for the Yokohama Y365s, including the Costco
membership.  I now have about 5,000 miles on the set I put on my '67 and
I am very pleased with them.  They seem to have a very good combination
of sharp handling and smooth ride with decent truck tire performance. 
They are good off road.  They seem to run over rocks and rough stuff
better than the truck tires I have run with the agressive &quot;off road&quot;
tread.  I was surprised by this the first time I took the rig &quot;4
wheeling&quot; on trails I've driven over with the other tires.  
	I wouldn't mind hearing any long term reports on these Costco tires.  I
hope that my early impressions are not just hog wash!
Gary Gibson
