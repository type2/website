Funny I had a contest with my family to find out what was wrong with the cover
everyone except for mom got it after looking the cover up and down many
times...they all thought it was going to be some technical thing about the
pictures I had spotted....no just the month!!!

Jim 

Believe it or not but even the VanBondo family has been unable to locate the
&quot;Novemebr&quot; issue of Spellchecks &amp; HotVWs. Look for a huge yellow Newbeetle
on 2/3rds of the cover and the RFH and pretentious Puck trailer on the lower
1/3.

The month of the issue was incorrectly spelled or should I say mizpelt. I
personally don't think that its worth scanning and posting. Just watch for
it. It'll show up sooner or later.
