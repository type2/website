Subject: Re: [VB] 'go fast' crash box

Hi David,
I looked at pics of the fire bus by the way and I'm
very jealous.
What mystifies me is where you get the $$$s to buy all
these beauties.
Anyhow, my solution is a simple one.
How about just going taller tyres?
I know it may affect the handling a little but then
splits aren't exactly in the Lotus class of road
hugging anyway and if you go with a set of radials on
15&quot; rims for street tyres the tyre walls should be
strong enough to prevent roll-over.
It may cut down your acceleration but you're running
redux boxes so that's not really an issue anyway.
Plus you can leave what must be a very nice crash box
in standard condition and simply change rims if you
don't need the higher speed or are at a show.
If it's only 10 mph you're after then why not at least
try it out.
The other advantage is that you're protecting the
reduction boxes as they do no more revs to gain the
higher speed.
&gt; What's the best way to go faster than 60 mph in a
&gt; pre may 19, 1959 bus?
&gt; It needs to remain stock height, and I'd prefer to
&gt; keep the crash box in
&gt; there.
Just a suggestion.
Keep finding those rare birds for us to drool over.
:o)
