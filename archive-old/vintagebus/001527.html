In general, try to stay away from the Pennsylvania-based motor oils (sorry
all you Pennsylvanians!) and better yet, go for the Texas-based ones.  A
friend of mine who has a shop here in Maryland recommened this, and he has
never been wrong before.  He is also the auto repair consultant for a
locally-produced 1/2 show on Maryland Public Television called MotorWeek.
Castrol is the only oil he recommends that is not Texas-based.
