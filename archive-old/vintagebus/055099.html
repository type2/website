I have had several opinions on trying to pull the alternator =
(converted)
without removing the engine.  Some say yes =96 with care =96 others say =
pull the
engine.  Any thoughts =96 I have read the archives and keep getting
conflicting stories.  If pulling it without removing the engine =96 how =
do you
get the Fan Shroud off?
