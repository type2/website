Subject: 195? Standard Sunroof Questions
Date: Fri, 9 Mar 2001 23:52:07 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Greetings all! I have recently acquired a 195? standard sunroof bus. I have
placed it on the vintage bus auction =
(http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/cgi-bin/auction/addbid.cgi?number=3D1280),
but am really wanting to learn some more about this bus. Being a standard
sunroof, I know it was never officially imported to the states. I still dont
know what year it is. I'd love to trade this thing for a 21 window or D/S
Cab. Mebbe other possibilities as well. It is just a bit more than I can
handle right now. Anyone with some info or interest
please let me know. Thanks in advance!

-Walt
