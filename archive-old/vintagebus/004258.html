Hi,

I just returned from the Octo and Soto meets. Octo was by far the better
attended one. I met several listees and learned a great deal more about type
II's. Bought a few minor parts for when I finally do my restore job. Sorry I
didn't stay for the beer at TJ's across the way.

There were quite a few very nice buses at both meets. The $32,000 bus didn't
look as good as the $$$'s said. Some rust around the wind shield areas. For
that kind of money it oughta be perrrrfecct!!!

Looked for Scott Fraser but didn't find him. Where are youuuuuu.

Chris
