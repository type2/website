There is a modified SP intake manifold with fuel injector ports welded on
the ends. There is a air throttle body that mounts to the carb mount and it
has an anemometer, vac port, and electric choke. Have seen them but not on a
running engine. Anyone have pics of one in a car, I would like to see it.

CIS is an analog fuel injection rig, that is supposed to be awesome with
DP heads. I do not think you can use it with SP. Ted?

!what is CIS.

!I have some relatives in the UK,so if they are available there, i could
get a few and then have them shipped over. but i wouldn't dare, unless
someone had some real life experiment with them.
