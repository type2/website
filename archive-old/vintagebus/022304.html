Crane makes a 6v electronic ignition, optical points for the distr and a
bit more voltage for the coil. Have been using it on our '65 Westy and
semms to work fine. JC Whitney has it for sale ever so often. 

Our '65 has 76,000 miles on it's original, untouched engine. It runs great,
but I know that can only go on for so long. The compression is fine,
doesn't use oil.  What will go first? What should we keep track of to keep
a handle on the engines health? We have a trip to Newfounland and back for
this up-coming summer [CT here], probably about 3000 miles the way we travel.

Any thoughts will be appreciated.

thanks, Jim
