 I've had solenoid trouble before and got a used starter with solenoid on it
 from a dude I know. I only used the solenoid and put it on my old starter
 and replaced the battery cable. Things have been fine for a year but then it
 acted up again, so I performed the John Muir tapping method with great
 success. BUT....... where can I, if anywhere, can I get a new solenoid
 without another starter attached to it?  It's a 12v starter in my '65
 Microbus with a 1600 dp.      Thanks people,

try you local Schmucks/Kragen's/Checkers-  they give you a liftime warranty 
on your starter as long as you have the receipt- cost is about $60  for your  
rebuildt regular 12V VW starter and the joy is that there is a shop in about 
every town so you can buy a starter in Calif and get it replaced years later 
in WA or wherever you live or road trip to.   
Comes with new starter bushing (12v starter to 12v tranny) which you should 
replace at the same time for increased starter life.
