Subject: Re: [VB] HELP! 67 engine lid busted
To: ncbus_at_mindspring_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Sounds like the hinge is busted , not the decklid.   Same hinge is used on 
buses 3/55 through 74 or some, so if there are any earlier bays around you 
can scope a hinge of of , do it.  Impact and hammer to undo the screws (two 
to decklid, to to body per hinge) helps.  Welol, almost crucial actually.

 I went to close the engine lid on the 1967 bus and right hinge pin 
 broke. The left side is looking questionable after struggling to 
 close the lid with one side broken. I need help please! What size 
 roll pin do I need to buy and what is the best way to remove the 
 broken ones and install the new ones. The bus is my only means of 
 transportation. The lid is not quite sealing. The temp her is in the 
 30s and based on the fact that &quot;the heat&quot; is not &quot;the warm&quot; I do not 
 think I will have any cooling problems tomorrow but I want to get 
 this fixed ASAP before the lid falls off on the road or the temp goes 
 back up.
 
 Thanks so much!
