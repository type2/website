Subject: 54 double cab????

Ok I just got off the phone with a friend of mine that restores old Ch*vys.
He had told me about a week ago about this old double cab he ran across in
his travels. I asked him to go out and talk to the owner for me since I am
600 miles away. Frank said that he just got back from looking at and talking
with the owner and was told it is a 1954.  Question did they make them back
then? Frank said it has an old California plate on it with 1961 tabs and
that it looks complete with bumpers and all.
I plan on going down with cash on Sunday to look at it and probably buy it,
but just was curious if it really could be that old, I mean I know they made
barndoor single cabs but I didn't think they made crews.
