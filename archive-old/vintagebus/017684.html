--- Thom Fitzpatrick &lt;thom_at_calweb_dot_com&gt; pondered:
&gt; 
&gt; Well, let's examine my '54:
&gt; 
&gt; * at least 1/3 of nose      - 3%
&gt; * longitudinal frame rains  - (didn't account for
them, maybe somehow incorporated in the rocker %%?) -
3%
&gt; * inner rockers - both sides?  3%
&gt; * doglegs - 9%
&gt; * corners - 9%
&gt; * cargo floor - 9%
&gt; * cab floor - (included in the cargo floor
percentage)
&gt; * 1/4 front bulkhead (also included)
&gt; * engine lid - 2%
&gt; * cargo doors - 5%
&gt; * big driver's side panel - 5%
&gt; * quarter panel behind cargo doors - 2%
&gt; * misc &amp; sundry patches - 4.5%

So lets add it up (keeping in mind that this is for
amusement purposes only)...

3+3+3+9+9+9+2+5+5+2+4.5=54.5%

That's not bad.  You only have to replace a little
over half the metal!  LOL!  

&gt; 
&gt; This doesn't include any &quot;soft parts&quot; such as
&gt; upholster or rubber,
&gt; or mechanical parts such as brakes, shocks, engine,
&gt; etc.
&gt; 

Yeah, I left out the soft parts on purposes...that
isn't included in the rule of nines.  I guess the docs
figure if you have any kind of burn on a lung, kidney
or something else internal, you have bigger
problems...
