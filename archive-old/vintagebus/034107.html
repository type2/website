There is also a BINZ in Tucson, Az. Mike Baily owns it, he bought it a few
months ago out of an ad in a L.A. newspaper, nobody must of saw the ad, the
bus was listed under trucks, not VW and the same person also had a 59 BINZ,
but it wasn't for sale. Also John VW Howard's old BINZ, (probably one of the
most original around)now resides in New Hampshire, so here are 3 more and if
I can think deep enough I think I can remember 2 more that weren't
mentioned.

Dan who runs Competition Engineering in AZ has one too.. supposed to be in
good shape. I was in there when a guy was beggin him to sell it one
time...its not officially for sale....price was high high but he sounded
like he'd part with it at the right $.
...everyone has their price.

hed take your barndoor and your notch for it...how much do you REALLY want
one? :)
