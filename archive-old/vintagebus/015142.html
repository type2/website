i recall tonny larsens' 50 or 51 panel in finland?? or denmark mebbe- anyway
he had to put larger 62-&gt; tailights for safety reasons. kinda shame!

m.

I think they were required to add the larger taillights and turn signals 
in some of the Euro countries.  I think some even had to retro  windshield
squirters!
