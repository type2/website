I think that the trip reports/&quot;what I found&quot;'s give those of us who are
not traveling/stuck in the same place for one reason or another a little
bit of escape from whatever reality we do have, no matter what day of
the week they happen to be posted. If it'll break the monotony of a
Monday, I'm for it.
	These kind people are sharing their experiences, and that is
self-absorbed? Sure, there are *a very few* people here who, if you send
them an e-mail commenting on their trip report, won't even reply, but
there are plenty of others who will.
	And for the utility of the list... try finding another one as useful as
this one is. You won't.
