Michele,

Don't feel bad at all Michele.  Bob is a grown adult and can and will
exercise his rights as a free individual - not as a puppet locked into every
whim of a mailing list.

I have never written to Bob, nor has he ever written to me, nor have I ever
met the man. So I can only form and make my coming comments and opinions on
passive observation of list traffic and personal accounts I have been privy
to. But I do know that post after post from him are full of demeaning and
derogatory remarks about people (newbies in particular) who don't have as
much T2 knowledge as him.  Even Bob's post to this list in response to this
thread contained demeaning remarks to these people!  (he called them all
&quot;little kiddies&quot; if I recall correctly.)

The issue here has never been about Bob's mechanical ability, or the man
himself, only the manner in which he dispenses his advice.  Yet this seems
to be exactly what others in the list have made it out to be...  they're all
acting like we've insulted his dead grandmother or something.

When a person participates in a PUBLIC forum, that person automatically puts
themselves up to the public scrutiny.  whether Bob set out to be put on the
pedestal he has or not, that fact is that the &quot;morale majority&quot; of the list
community has done so for him.  Perhaps that high and mighty position is
what led to this &quot;attitude&quot; of his, I don't know. I am not a clinical
psychologist.  To coin an old phrase though &quot;The higher the pedestal, the
harder you will fall&quot;. (or something like that ;-) If Bob did not like this
position in life, he should have just gotten out of his own accord.  Which,
in fact he has done - an action which in itself speaks volumes of his own
attitude in my opinion.

To those who have supported and defended Bob in such an exuberant and
dedicated manner, I only hope that they have the maturity and the presence
of mind to take a moment and step back to try to view the issue from the
other side of the fence.  The same goes for the Bob-haters as well.  We
cannot afford in such a tight community to get caught up in a lot of
emotional &quot;stone-throwing&quot; just because a few have expressed an opinion
which conflicts with that of the &quot;morale majority&quot; of the list community.
We should in embrace all these opinions together.  It is our diversity of
knowledge, attitudes and people which makes this list so strong.

It's not important whether Bob is an ass-hole or not.  It's only important
that that is the perception of himself he has given certain listees.
Everyone has been getting so bent out of shape about a faction of the list
making assumptions about Bob's personality and attitude, and yet this is
EXACTLY what Bob himself is doing to &quot;newbies&quot; and others when he replies in
his abrasive, harsh and demeaning manner!  And the saddest part here is that
these are the people most of all that we would want to put our &quot;best foot
forward&quot; too, these will be the people who will be carrying our passion for
this hobby into the next century, passing it on to further generations.   I
is so easy to see, in my mind anyway, how a newbie to the hobby can perceive
of a person like Bob in a Muir/Porsche god-like manner.  And imagine how
that person feels when he/she is replied to in such a demeaning and/or
derogatory manner?  How  many of us out there have ever had an idol like
that, only to finally approach them and be told in so many words &quot;get outta
my face kid&quot;?  it is a VERY depressing and belittling experience.  I would
not be surprised at all by the numbers of would-be enthusiasts who may have
lost the taste for our hobby because of attitudes like this.   THAT in my
mind is a worse crime than all the flames and hate mail flying around
combined!

It truly is sad though, to see such a tremendous resource that Bob has given
all of us pulled from the public forum.  But that is Bob's right and we must
respect that- no matter what his motivation may be.  There are however
plenty of other useful and informative resources out there for us to
explore, so there is no use crying over spilled milk.  We will survive, the
list will survive, as will our busses.

But alas, it has been decreed that we take out discussion off-list.  As well
it should be I suppose.  We all know who each other are ;-) and can p-mail
till out fingers are bruised.  I AM READY I EXCLAIM!!  lol

I hope Thom doesn't spank me too hard for CC'ing this to the list ;-)
