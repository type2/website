&lt;&lt; Last night I was working a bit more on my front beam and I was going 
through
 the trays of bolts to find the four 12mm x 50mm (17mm hex head) bolts that
 secure the link pins to the torsion arms.  I ended up finding 3 Rasche and 2
 Dorn bolts.... The Rasche had the hole for the cotter pin and the Dorn did
 not.  Hmmm I thought, maybe my chrome guy lost one of the Rasche bolts and
 the two Dorn go some place else.  
==========
when adjusting link pins I have noticed that some bolts had cotter pin holes, 
and some didn't.  But seeing as everything was fairly dirty, and I didn't 
look, I don't know what markings they had.  Just noticed the cotter poin or 
not.  but I realised I dont have to take the cotter pin out, just undo the 
nut a bit so the link pin will turn.
