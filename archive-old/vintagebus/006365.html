&lt;&lt;Hey all...I hate to do this, but with the unexpected notice in the mail
about the shop getting torn down in under 3 months now...I have to do it
as I have no place else to go with it. My 63 is up for grabs&gt;&gt;

I was going to p-mail Isaiah on this then it occurred to me that there are probably a lot of you who might be able to benefit from this.

I'm a contractor and so have a lot of things that I can't keep in town. Things like trailers, scaffolding, ladders, lumber, all that contractor crap. Well I also have a bunch of VW projects in waiting as well. All of this needs to be stored. I rent space from a farmer, they always have a place dedicated to their equipment and are usually grateful for a little more cash. I get unlimited outdoor storage for $15.00 a month. I pay the man once a year, he by being there watches over my things, I have unlimited access to my stuff and I get to write off the expense. Now I know this arrangement would not be practical for everyone and it is outdoor storage. But this might spark some ideas for someone in need. 

Now Isaiah, you probably have more time, energy and money invested in your '63 than you will appreciate by selling it since few are interested in picking up someone else's project in mid stream. Maybe you could find another location for your project until you can get it somewhere to finish it.

Good luck,

Rick
