&lt;&lt; Thanks for your reply, The play is right, left like driver side and 
passager side.  I have read a  little about adjustment for the box but not 
much, is this needed? is it 
 easy? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Your steering box sound dangerous, and needs either to be rebuilt or 
replaced.  Adjusting is easy, but will only take play out of the radial 
movement.    Eric&amp;Barb
