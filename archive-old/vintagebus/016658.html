Look  people
i mean volkswagen people or people that are really into volkswagens are some 
of the nicest people around. Here we are virtually sending hate mail to each 
other cut the mud slinging i think Kabayo got the message. I mean geez if 
this keeps up we should serouisly shut down the list the admin didn't start 
up this great thing for hate mail i may be only 13 but i do know whats wrong 
and whats right. The whole point of this list is for bus people to help each 
other and to not take any ones side but Kabayo might have helped someone 
find something for there bus. Just my 2 cents
