I saw this ad in our local paper (Oxnard, CA):  67 VW Westfalia Camper w/
roof rack &amp; full tent. Not running, $3000.00  (805)642-8609 (WKF537).

I called and spoke with the seller.  He said it didn't have an engine in it,
it's a bench,  pop-top,  and 1/3 roof rack.  He said he thought the trans
was good but couldn't guarantee it.
