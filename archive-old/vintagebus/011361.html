Subject: Ginger's jalousie windows- an R&amp;R tip
Cc: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Ginger was commenting on cleaning up/repairing her camper windows. 

&quot;And replaced the seals on one jalousie window, boy was that more work than
I expected. The metal looked good once I scraped off the concrete like glue
used on the inner aluminum frame.  Only four more to go!

VanBondo suspects that the &quot;concrete like glue&quot; was a rock hard vesion of
the &quot;putty tape&quot; that is readily available at any RV or trailer sales and
supplier. The putty is exaclty like the window sash putty that was/is used
in older style home window frames. The putty tape comes in a roll with a
crepe paper liner. It is produced in a consistant thickness and width. The
crepe keeps it from sticking together while rolled up like a roll of tape.
(I think that I have made that clear enough...)
It is real cheap and definitely in need of being replaced. It is the real
seal between the weather and the interior of your bus. The grey rubber
outter seal is technically a &quot;dust seal.&quot;

Check with your hardware supplier or professional paint supplier. I think
that there might be a chance that some form of mineral spirits, paint
thinner etc. **In a well ventilated area away from flames** might help to
soften the petrified putty. Check with a professional for advice.  

It sounds like Ginger is making great progress on the bus. You go Girl! =)
Hopefully, we can introduce ourselves at the Seattle meet in July.
