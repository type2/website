Subject: Re: [VB] New Member, but I got here as fast as I could...

John,

Welcome to the active list.  Good luck with the new home etc.  I am located 
in NJ and know of a sweet single cab for sale in North Jersey.  It looks to 
be a 65 or 66.  It sits on a highway with a for sale sign on it and I pass it 
everyday.  It is owned by a guy that owned a foreign part store in the area 
and went out of business (so I imagine he is selling because he needs the 
cash).  I would love to have it, but I would have to get a new wife first.  
It looks in very good condition except that he did some funky work on the 
drop gates.  If you have any interest let me know and I will check it out for 
you.
