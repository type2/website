Subject: switch to synthetic?

on the topic of switching to synthetic, I am contemplating switching my
engine oil over to synthetic, based on list discussions, talking with many
people, and some research. what my research, and discussions have not shown
me is:

any info on the oil blends(these are half synthetic/have dino juice)

what the steps involved are for switching your engine from regular oil to
synthetic. If this info on switchig oil types is accurate, then that would
mean needing to pull the engine, to get at all the seals that are exposed to
the oil, right?

Really any rubber seals. They get a set to the oil and a switch distrubes
this. It is like mixing chemicals. you can mix 2 with no proble but add a
3rd and you get a reaction. Same with syn and petro oils. if you mix the two
together your oil will turn to goo. They just don't mix and the rubber is
porous so it takes in both and the reaction is that the rubber goes south.
Gets soft and leaks. because seals get a set to an oil and if you change
that it is gonna leak.
