Hey Volks

This item just made the South African press, have any az listees seen this?:

Report reads that 25 years ago Marge and Gene Fehr of Phoenix had their red
VW Microbus stolen. They recently got a call from Phoenix police to say
they had recovered the bus. Story was accompanied by a pic of the Fehrs
with a model deluxe splittie &quot;which was all they thought they had left of
their bus&quot;.
