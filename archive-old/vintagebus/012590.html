&gt;&gt; Many thanks to those who responded with backfiring suggestions, most
&gt;of
&gt;&gt; which involved timing, crossed plug wires, or the valve train.  No
&gt;&gt; crossed wires, and the timing is dead on (static).  Tonite I'll
&gt;check
&gt;&gt; the valve train.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But I'm wondering if I need to tear this thing down and look closer,
&gt;for
&gt;&gt; two reasons:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1) on reassembly, my dizzy drive shaft notch didn't line up like the
&gt;&gt; books say at TDC.  It was off by about 20degrees counterclockwise.
&gt;I've
&gt;&gt; tried puzzling out the geometry in my head and it *seems* like this
&gt;is
&gt;&gt; not a problem, but to get timing right at present, the notch on the
&gt;&gt; dizzy rim points sorta towards #1 cyl.  But it's the relationship
&gt;&gt; between dizzy cam and #1 plug wire that matters, right?
&gt;
&gt;As long as the rotor points to the correct cylinder at TDC between
&gt;compression and power for that cylinder AND the points have just
&gt;opened,
&gt;the position of the drive gear is irrelevent.
&gt;

to the friendly and knowledgeable list members,

this brings to mind a question,
the #3 cyl is retarded 4 degrees on type I/ II upright engines and not on
type IV (am i right?)
is this in the dizzy cam or the cap?
if you do the old switch-a-roo on the plug wires the wrong cylinder gets
the retard yah?
if you do pull out the dizzy drive gear, be careful when you put it back
in.
 the crank gear is soft metal and can be buggered up like our hero did on
one occasion.
