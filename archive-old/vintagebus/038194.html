&lt;&lt; how would you go about doing this? i am in the process of stripping my 64 
for 
 paint and it does make a lot of sence to take the parcel tray out to work on 
 all the electrical because working in really tight spaces is no fun. &gt;&gt;
Hi Phil,
To completely remove the package tray out of the bus remove mounting 
fasteners, dissconnect the speedo cable from the left front axle bearing 
cover and pull the speedo cable out of the spindle, up into the front 
interior of the bus.
