I went out shopping for a welding machine today and I think I have made up
my mind but I wanted to through it out to y'all and see what you say.  It's
a Millermatic 185.  I decided to go with something that is probably a little
more than I need since I'm a man and that's the way I think.  Also my Dad,
god bless him, told me last night that he would buy me a welder for my
birthday / Christmas.  He placed a $1000 limit which should buy a damn good
welder for home use.  I am limited to house hold juice so I can't get wild.
I didn't see any Lincolns that really compared to the Miller.  I'm sure they
exist but the shop I was at didn't have any.  Any of y'all have good or bad
things to say about Miller?  Thanks!
