Hi Christen

I am not sure they are westy tumblers (cups)
If you send them to me via U.P.S. collect, I will appraise them for you ...O
K ?   ;-)

&gt;I think I may have found a set of early westy aluminum cups.  I found a set
&gt;of the small shot glasses.  There are six of them, in various colors, and
&gt;they are marked &quot;Made In Germany&quot; on the bottom.
&gt;
&gt;Are these westy cups?
&gt;
&gt;Also, anyone know what these puppies are worth, if they are westy cups?
&gt;These are NOS still wrapped in tissue paper.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Christen Christian
&gt;
