&gt; I'm getting a little ticked off when people start demanding that I lower
&gt; my price without ever have driven or had first hand view of my vehicles.

I think they're blown away by that baywindow dash in the splitty!  :)

I guess it's a matter of negotiating technique.  It seems the hard-core
hagglers (like those people who intend to resell the vehicle, not keep it
for themselves) like to hit hard and fast.  If they can't make a dent in
you, then their future profit is lessened and the deal isn't worth their
time.  At least you're done with them quickly.

I had a deal once where the buyer negotiated a price and I went through
all the paperwork only to have the buyer announce at the last moment that
they couldn't get the last $200 of the agreed upon price and would I
absorb the difference?  Needless to say I was not going for that, but
apparently enough people do to make the ploy worthwhile.  I took the car
home and they called again offering $100 less than the agreed-on price.
Again I said no.  A week later they finally came up with the full amount
and I let them have the car.  I regretted it later on, since they didn't
transfer the title, ran up a bunch of parking tickets, and then resold the
car.  I had collection agencies calling trying to collect on the tickets,
but luckily I had done my part of the paperwork and the notice of sale was
on file with the state, a fact conveniently overlooked by the collection
agency.

Sometimes it's better to not make the sale!  :)
