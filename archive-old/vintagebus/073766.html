Subject: Re: [VB] So basically ..

Congratulations on getting your bus away from those boneheads. I hope 
you didn't leave very much money behind. I'm also glad to see that the 
brace is made using threaded rod. It might not be too much trouble to 
get it out of there. From what I've been reading about this shop, I was 
expecting a welded angle iron monstrosity that would have to be cut out 
with a torch.

Now, what about the case? Is it the same one you had before or is it a 
different one? Is there still a huge oil leak? Any clunking sounds?

Contact the local bus owners on the AIRS list.

I think the worst is behind you now.

&gt; all my money on this beast and trade away my 71.  Maybe if I buy some
&gt; insurance and the bus has an accident I can recover my loss.  But seriously -
&gt; if it is as bad as I think it must be, there is NO WAY I would sell it to
&gt; someone else.  Just suck it up and take the loss.
