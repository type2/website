Subject: 60 Era Panel RHD

Gang,

I saw a 60s Era Panel RHD in town today, how rare are this type of bus?  It
needs a nose and read wheel well metal, paint, seats, body work...  I left a
note for the owner, however I am wondering if this is something special or
very ordinary.  Does anyone on the list have one for sale that is in better
shape.

-Wayne
