Hello list,


Has anyone out there in listland been able to find the thin vinyl (.020&quot;) 
covering material used to recover the visible sides of the kick panels 
and door panels. My 67 deluxe had 'platinum' vinyl, a slightly metallic 
light bronze color, along with the salt and pepper middle area on the 
door panels. I seek the platinum or some similar colored vinyl covering 
with the same thickness (0.020&quot;), as anything thicker won't  allow the 
kick panels to fit properly into the lower flanges and still get around 
the headlights. I am using the Wolfsburg West panels and don't want to 
settle for the grey finish they come with. 

Thanks,

ca;
