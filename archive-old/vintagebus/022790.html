Subject: Opinions: oil cooler-stand oil filter
Mime-Version: 1.0


I'm getting ready to have an engine built for the 60.  Sorry NQ, but I'd
rather pay someone else to go thru the hassle...

Anyway, I was thinking of putting one of those (I think they're called)
&quot;factory filters&quot; on it, which is this do-dad which goes (replaces?) on the
doghouse oil cooler mount.  I've heard good things about them on RAMVA, but
I thought I'd ask here.

I think I'd also like to put on one of those extra oil sumps.  I had one on
the '56, and it didn't seem to do any harm, and I like the idea of a little
more oil to spread the wear across.   I already know they don't do jack for
additional cooling.
