&gt;Is removing the dash really as easy as it appears?  It would certainly make
&gt;it a lot easier to paint.  It really could use a quality coat.&gt;&gt;
&gt;Yes, it is.  The only problem is you have to dissconnect the speedo cable at
&gt;the wheel, and pull it up into the front seat area.


What are we talking about when we say 'dash'?  The dashboard is welded to
the body shell, isn't it?  The shelf BELOW the dash is held in by screws.
