Subject: On the road again!...well, almost

I had rebuilt the 1600cc DP engine that came with my '59 Kombi about 
3000 miles ago. I had the heads rebuilt instead of buying new ones. 
One of 'em didn't hang and I had to pull the engine at 3000 miles, 
tear it down and pull the head. I sent it back to the rebuilder and 
got it back this past week. I put the engine back together and 
installed it into my bus this weekend. Started it up and it ran like 
a champ. 1 mile test drive had it running and feeling great. The true 
test will be if I can start driving it into work next week. That's 50 
miles a day on the engine...most on a highway.

Now to the &quot;IF&quot;. The generator on this engine is a new bosch unit 
purchased at rebuild time. Same with regulator. 3000 miles on each. 
Worked great in the past. Now when I started the engine, the 
generator light comes on and stays on. I checked my wires and 
everything seems to be right. I changed the fan belt, and also pulled 
a shim to tighten it a little. No apparant change in the light. Also 
doesn't seem to change at higher RPM's. The whole engine has pretty 
much been sitting unused for about 3 months...including generator. 
Any ideas or suggestions?

Oh yeah, another thing. i finally found a way that works for me to 
install that upper engine mounting screw that always was a b*tch! 
It's the one up there by the clutch cable and arm. I've got the wing 
nut on my clutch, 1600cc DP doghouse engine WITH the heat boxes 
installed. So it's pretty tight up there. I got the screw started by 
laying down under the engine sideways...with my head on the drivers 
side and my feet to the passenger side. I reached up with my left arm 
and easily start the screw. After going finger tight as far as I 
could, I grabbed my cheap little air impact wrench. I fished it up in 
there and sure enough it could reach the head of the screw. I pulled 
the trigger and that thing was in a few seconds. Wow. I've spent many 
hours over many times installing this screw and trying to figure easy 
ways to do it. Now I've got the mounting part of the engine install 
down to a science. With a little more work on making my wiring and 
such &quot;quick connects&quot; and labeling, I should be able to yank and 
re-install without too much sweat.

FYI: I've had this engine out 2 times now since I rebuilt it. Once 
for the clutch and once for this head. All within 3000 miles.

The little test drive got my blood pumping again and the cooler 
weather here (lower 90's and down) had made me really want to start 
driving my bus again. Unfortunatly this generator thing is picking 
the scab at that sore spot I've got from having trouble with so many 
little things.  So send my some ideas and hopefully it'll be 
something little.

See ya.

p.s. i brought home a '72 Westy this weekend...along with 2 partly 
disassembled T4 engines....a 1700 and a 1800. I traded some used 
furniture and a TV for this bus. There was one of those aluminum side 
steps in there as well. I've wanted one of those for a long time. 
Unfortunatly one of the mounting brackets is broken. It's the on the 
right as you face the step. Anyone got a good one on a bent up old 
step they can get rid of? Thanks.
