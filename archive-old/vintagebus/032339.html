If you are going to build up a motor past a stock engine I recommend using 
duel port heads as they have better air flow and they are know to have 
higher performance not just higher torque.  Most shops will not build past 
a 1600 with out using DP heads.  Simply they are designed to add power.  I 
have NEVER had a single head crack on me.  My advice is keep up on regular 
maints. and this will not be a problem.  Also if you buy after market DP 
heads get them from a known house like MOFOCO or GENE BERG, not VW house of 
wreckers.
My 2 cents.
If you disagree, please don't waste my time with Idle replies!  We all have 
different opinions, no flames necessary.
Also have them install case savers for the studs...

&gt;Ok here goes.  I have to build an engine.  I've got a dual port AE cased
&gt;1600 as a core.  Honestly I'm not a fan of dual ports because they are
&gt;known to crack and I need torque not peak RPMs.  I'm thinking along the
&gt;lines of a 1776 single port.
