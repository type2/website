&lt;&lt; Should I suck it up and do it correct with correct lights or should I just 
put on the small lights?&gt;&gt;
Hi Lincoln,
Well of course it is your bus!  But if you want a opinion then we would say 
that you would do well to return the body to stock as much as possible.

&lt;&lt; Also, about the location of the lights.  When I look at some of this era 
taillights I find that some are kinda lower and some are kinda higher as far 
as position on the back. &gt;&gt;
That is probably because of the pre-over rider bumpers years, and the later 
years that had overriders.  After all it would have been a automotive Foe Pah 
(SP?) for VW to allow the tail lights to have been covered by the 1958 and 
newer reinforced bumpers with over riders!  Eric&amp;Barb
