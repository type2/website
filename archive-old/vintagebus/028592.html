Subject: engine bay colors

Hey there guys and gals..
While the motor is out of the 62...I thought I'd take the opportunity to
clean all of the crud out of the engine compartment.  The gas tank is
turquoise, and the rest is black.  Is this the common color
configuration?  What determined what color the gas tank was painted?
Are all engine bays painted black?  I borrowed a pressure washer and
some environmentally friendly degreaser.  Can I spray out the engine
compartment with this?  I don't want to have the degreaser wreck any of
the paint...and I will read all of the applications for use before
hand....  Has anyone else done this before?  How does it turn out?  I'll
tape off the voltage regulator to keep it dry...

Another license plate possibility which I am really liking... (just
thought of it) is DRIVEIT ....yeahhhhh... :)
