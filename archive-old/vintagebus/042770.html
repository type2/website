Hello again folks...

On this note, a friend of mine has seen in a junkyard here in the US
something really cool.  I want to make one... can anyone here tell me how?

IRS reduction boxes!

He said that the bus had what looked like bug IRS trailing arms, but
reduction boxes were bolted on.

The reduction boxes instead of having swing axles coming out of them had
flanges for CV joints.

I dunno why but i like this idea... you get the ground clearance of a bus
tranny, but the tucking under rear wheel thing goes away... so if you want
to jack up the bus (i have an off road baja splitty planned in my
mind) you can do so without making the rear suspension geometry
unstable... (the best you can do with an IRS conversion with Type 4 CV's
is stock height... no taller.)

Anyone seen this or ever heard of it? it almost sounds like either
a) something someone made or b) something that came from brazil..

any ideas on how to come up with a setup like that would be
appreciated. (my friend wants the one in the junkyard..)

take care,

Steve
