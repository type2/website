I added some pictures from the &quot;Southwest Bug-In 9&quot; in Phoenix, AZ this
weekend to my site.  Not much to see but a couple new Buses came out that
usually only see service in the owner's back yards...

Not much of a swap this time, my sole purchase was a decent but mismatched
set of solid stale-air heater boxes for $2.

One guy had a couple 60s factory VW manuals on display, including an early
60s Bus parts book.  He had just found them in the storage room of a Phoenix
VW dealership, so the good stuff is still out there...
