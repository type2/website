Was working on the 67 pop top westy and it ate up a wheel bearing.  Outside 
one on drivers side.  The inner ring on the bearing decided to become one 
with the spindle.  I've been working on cutting it off but then my grinder 
broke.  So now im at my house with no grinder and that damn bearing ain't 
coming off!  My brother was hoing to take it to BBBIV which would be his 
FIRST bus event.  Just trying to find someone in Phoenix who would be willing 
to come over and help if possible.  I'm desperate!
