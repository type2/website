On the driver's side, the trick is to get the special nut that gets
embedded in the case, so you screw the bolt in from underneat.
If you can find a long-enough allen bolt, you're in phat city.

On the passenger side, it shouldn't be an issue.  If I can get my hands
in there, anyone can...

Also, I weld a tab onto the bolt head, so it doesn't spin.  There's
special  half-moon heads, but I find that most of the time they 
aren't large enuf.

&gt; I was surprised again yesterday by how hard it is to get the nuts on the 
&gt; upper engine bolts in a Type 2.  In fact, I'm still at it this morning.  I 
&gt; think if I can jam a socket and extension in front of the driver's side bolt, 
&gt; I may be able to wiggle the nut down past the doghouse shroud and get the 
&gt; damned thing started.  I'm still not sure what I'll do to secure the 
&gt; right-side bolt.  Anyone have any real good ideas on this subject?
