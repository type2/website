To: &lt;vanagon_at_vanagon_dot_com&gt;, &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;, &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;
Subject: New E-mail Address
Message-ID: &lt;000101be80f2$6cc76380$1f498dd1_at_the-bus-depot&gt;

I am growing inceasingly dissatisfied with my local ISP, Netcarrier, and am
looking toward making a change. To this end, I have set up a permanent
personal e-mail account,
	busdepot_at_email_dot_com
which will remain constant on an ongoing basis.  Please use this, not
ron_at_netcarrier_dot_com, when e-mailing me directly, as I am not sure how much
longer ron_at_netcarrier_dot_com will exist.  This new address is for e-mail
intended for me personally, rather than for The Bus Depot as a whole.


IMPORTANT - The Bus Depot's main e-mail address remains
	sales_at_busdepot_dot_com
This is the address for general Bus Depot inquiries, price quotes, orders,
questions about your order, product questions, etc.  So if your e-mail is
for The Bus Depot in general and does not require my personal attention,
please continue to send it to sales_at_busdepot_dot_com.


So in a nutshell...
  sales_at_busdepot_dot_com   for most Bus Depot inquiries
  busdepot_at_email_dot_com   to reach me personally


Thanks,
Ron Salmon
