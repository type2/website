I've got a question, is the fuel petcock different on a single cab then a
regular bus?? these would be the one with the reserve lever on them. I have
a bunch of new (not NOS) fuel petcocks and when I went to install one on my
side loader the lever would be in the wrong position. The cable would have
to be pulled out for the on position and pushed in for the reserve. I have
installed these on buses without a problem and checked all the OG ones I
have and they were all the same. None of my other single cabs have these on
them (all replaced by PO's), so I have nothing to compare to.

TIA  ronnie

ps. the side loader is just about ready for the road, changed all
fluids,shift coupler, all new brakes and bearings (rgb's), greased everthing
I could grease, Claraized every moving part
new German master and cylinders, shoes, seals etc. New cables and bowden
tube and am ready to roll. The PO's told me they had redone all the brakes,
but that must have been when they put the new tires on over 20 years ago, as
I needed to redo them all again, but all is good, so off to MVD for plates
and tags and my new daily driver will be on the road, original 40 HP and
all. No need for speed.
