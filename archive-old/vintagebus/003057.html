Subject: RE: [VB] APB 59 double cab parts

Terry,

The little rubber buffers are about an inch in diameter and 1/4 - 3/8 inch
thick.  They have a pointed nub on the back side that pops through the hole
in the sheet metal and holds it in place... i.e. there is no screw.  They're
a pain to get out in one piece from above.  If you have access to the
underframe, they easily push out.  There should be six of them if my memory
is working correctly.

You say you 'think' you have a 59... what's the vin#?

It looks like they were there, &amp; have been removed it appears there were at
least 4 of them, is that correct? The areas has been filled with
silicone? Were they bolted from under neath, or screwed in from the top?
