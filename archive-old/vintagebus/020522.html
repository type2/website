To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Thank you for your input. It makes sense now that I
know the steps involved. I called up a wheel polishing
place in phx and gave me a quote of $75/wheel. I'm
just gonna go that route instead and take care of
them. Only reason I was thinking chrome is because of
the maintance factor. The guy at the shop said I
wouldn't need to clear cloat the wheels, but should I
do it anyways? I don't want the luster to fade away in
a few months. What should I use to prolong the shine?
Thanks!
