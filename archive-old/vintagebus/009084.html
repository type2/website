&gt;$1500.00 or Best Offer
&gt;
&gt;Did anyone else see this ad on Everett's page??
&gt;Gotta be a joke.............................

Probably a fake, note the &quot;Vandelet Industries&quot; reference.  If the email
comes back rejected, I will be deleting it.

Went to Pomona today, dang, never saw so many 21 and 23-windows for sale at
once, everybody must need money to fill up their y2k 55 gallon drums of
drinking water.  :)  There was a scary 23-window for $3500, I've never seen
a roof that rusty before, I'm pretty sure there was more empty space than
roofline left.

There seemed to be an abnormal # of Bus crank-start pieces for sale too,
coincidence?
