California SUCKS for tags.  The DMV here insist on everyone who has a truck
to be registered as a commercial vehicle.  My 63 doublecab was costing me
over $50 a year.  Now it's sporting a personalized Florida tag reading &quot;MR
VW&quot;.  It's a good thing to be in the military.  This allows us to avoid
stupid laws...like state income tax.

I think TX is probably one of the worst. It cost me around $50 I believe.
No income tax here, so they get you on registration, tobacco, gas, and
property. I think if I do the &quot;classic&quot; tags they're pretty cheap...and you
don't have to get you VW inspected anymore. Of course there are
restrictions to having that tag. Only supposed to drive to shows and events.
