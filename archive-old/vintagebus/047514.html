Subject: Parting out - '64 Kombi KCMO
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


The '64 Kombi in my driveway is going under the knife tomorrow.  Tight front 
end, big nut reduction boxes, good steering box, pop outs, various sheet 
metal, etc.  Email me with wants if you need anything or for more details.  
Sheet metal gets hauled off Friday.

Bus is just east of Kansas City, Missouri.  Will ship parts anywhere.

-Dan
