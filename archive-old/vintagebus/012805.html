Hi,

I am cross -posting this to vintagebus because it relates to single port
engines. To be specific it is the original stock 1600 that came in the '69
bus

After a good old fashioned engine yanking, John pointed out to me that I am
missing the vital pieces of cooling tin that surround the heat risers as
they come thru the tin. DOH!

A quick check of catalogs reveals no source of after market or repro parts
so I am coming you with a request for the needed parts. I need one (or is it
two pieced really) for each side of the engine or if you know of a source
let me know.



Thanks
Chris
