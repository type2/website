Hi!!

Im not a veteran in bidding over Ebay, but ive found few pieces interesting
at good price for my split 1960!!

Then i won a bid before christmas it was:

Dear autohaus and mleard,
Congratulations - this auction successfully ended
Item Title :  VW Bus Bullet Seals 1955 to 1961 (Item# 520262952)
	Final Price : $10.50
	Auction Ended At : Dec-13-00 13:31:15 PST
	Total number of bids : 8
	Seller User ID : autohaus


Then since when i email they alway say it will look next saturday for the
shipping price ( he, im in Canda, not a too complicated international
shipping)
..and yesterdays i found:

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/aw-cgi/ebayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=540954721&amp;
r=0&amp;t=0

the same bullet for sale with same annoucement, did the guy thought the
price wasnt enough high and put it back on ebay ??
What could i do, i need this i just throw out with blasting one of mine, the
corrosion was too high...   then i look in catalog and only find seals, not
the metal tube going with it !!

Any advice or idea will be interesting!!

PS- Do you think shipping to Canada is such an hassle ??
