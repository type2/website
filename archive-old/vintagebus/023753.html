Subject: Roof Rack for sale

I recently, last night, bought a 72 camper.  I now have 2 busses, a 70
and a 72.  I will be selling the 70 soon.  I now have a roof rack that
will not fit on my camper.

I have an 8' rack.  It is in great condition, all metal and no rust.  It
has all the eye bolts on the rack, however, it has only one clamp.  I'm
sure You can make some pretty easy. I know it fit on my microbus, I'm
not sure how far back or forward years it'll fit.  I'm sure someone else
knows better than I.

So I'm looking to sell it.  I'm asking $200 for it.  I live in
Edgewater, MD, just outside Annapolis.

I'd imaging it would be appropriate to send all inquires to me not the
lists.
