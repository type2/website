Subject: 2-tone interior panel supplier?? Front seat FS.
Message-ID: &lt;375DE6A9.92ED3E1F_at_mcn_dot_org&gt;

Hi all-

I need a complete set of 2 tone panels for the wifes '67.
Who else but sewfine makes 2 tone panes.  All the catalogs I
have just have the ordinary vinyl with ordinary colors.  I
need oatmeal tweed inside and maroon regal velour
top/bottom.

Also, I need a supplier for front seat covers.  Same problem
as above.  I need oatmeal tweed (top) and tan vinyl
(sides).  It is a 1/3 2/3 front bench.  It is to match a set
of seats I recently got.  The front seat of the set I bought
is a full solid bench from a 60? deluxe.  She wants to keep
the folding set it came with, besides, it doest fit the same
brackets (of course.....)  It is newly re-upholstered in the
colors and fabric described above.  It is for sale if anyone
needs it.
