Subject: Re: [VB] Was Bus Engines, Now More Cooling

Way I see it is, increasing displacement and power, doesn't necessarily mean
you must have more cooling.

If you're still using stock 040 heads, you have the same cooling 'capacity'
as a stock motor.  If it takes 35hp to chug your bus down the road at 45mph
(i don't know what it really takes, i'm just saying), then it doesn't matter
if your engine makes peak power of 150hp, or 48hp, you're only using 35
ponies.  Now if you use those 150 ponies climbing a hill, while you're
loaded down, then yes, you will run hotter if you don't increase the cooling
capacity.

There are a lot of factors like cam, CR, etc, that will affect the running
temp, but if the only difference between two motors is displacement,
(everything else the same), then the difference in temperature if both
motors have the same load on them, would  be very small if any at all.
Just my opinion though.
:-)

Something I did to my bus to make it run cooler on the freeway, was to
remove the front tin (nearest the trans) to allow more air into the engine
bay, and make this mod to the doghouse:
http://www.geocities_dot_com/eaallred2/doghousemod.html
so that the hot air coming out of the doghouse does not get sucked back into
the fan.  Two hoses from that exit out back away from the intake.  I also
made sure to have the tins that go between the case and the heaterboxes in
place to help make sure hot air off the heads and cylinders didn't waft back
up to the fan.

This mod was good for 15 degrees off the oil temp on the highway.  Only a
few degrees cooler around town.  I firmly believe that the stock louvers of
a splitty bus are not enough for a doghoused motor while spinning over 3500
rpms on the freeway.  I can now hold 3700-3800 rpm for hundreds of miles and
not run too hot.

Bad part is, the engine bay doesn't look stock with the two extra hoses
going down through the rear tin, but then again, a DP motor in there doesn't
either.
