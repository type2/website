 Rich Yost has an original one ( with new canvas) in green and white. Rich
and his son Richie camped in it when we went the the Seatle show last year.
Easy up and down. Water proof to. I have a few pictures of it from the trip.
Maybe he will bring it to Kelly park, depends on which bus he wants to
bring. He also had it at BBB3  two years ago. No one seemed to notice then.
I have a couple original VW dealer post cards that show this setup on a
camper in the showroom in red and white.

John howard.
