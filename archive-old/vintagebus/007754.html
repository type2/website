&gt; OK kyle (westfailure) it's time to step up to the
&gt; plate and make those dang window tracks you told
&gt; me about and look robert davis needs some, i'll bet
&gt; he's got those tailights you need or some other goodies,
&gt; see i'm setting up a trade for you, also i could use 2 sets.

Damn. Well allright, let me get some materials together and I'll tool up and
take a run at it. Prolly will take a couple of weeks or so. If you got a bus
to run them on I'll send them up to you, Ronnie. I have the windows from the
61 to pattern from, but it's still yard-art so I can't beta-test the little
dears.
