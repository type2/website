Hey all,
Today I brought my '65 Kombi (Gumbi) to it's new home next to my parents
home in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.  The day started out uneventful enough.  I
was down in Moscow, Idaho (where the bus was) and I was going to drive it
the 83 miles it was from Moscow to Cd'A.  I had a friend come along for
the trip, just in case something was to go wrong.  Well, something did go
wrong.  About ten miles out of Moscow, Gumbi got a little hot.  Well,
maybe a lot hot!  It's good to have friends!  I hitched a ride all the way
back to Cd'A with my buddy.  The bus died on a straight strip of Hwy 95
with hardly any shouler, so it was almost hanging into the oncoming
traffic.  I knew I had to get it off that road before the end of the day.
I got on the horn and rounded up a car carrying trailor, and at about
6:00pm me and another buddy (the first buddy was tired of messing with
that VW s$%t) headed back down to Moscow.  The trip was pretty uneventful,
except for the rare pleasure of seeing a bull going to town on another
cow.  Anyway, we dropped the trailor on a side road up from the bus.  We
then got the bus running again by pull starting it with the truck and I
just drove it onto the trailor.  We jumped in the truck and kept our eyes
open for any more cows doing the dirty deed.  Pulled into Cd'A at about
8:00 and it was still light out and everything.  Me and my buddy push
stared it so I could show my folks that the thing actually did move under
its own power.  They were very impressed to say the least!
