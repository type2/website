&lt;&lt; Would you have any ideas as to why oil would be pushed up and out the 
dipstick tube? Its a '70 T-3 engine &lt;Snip&gt; (Done up as a type 1). Its not 
over full and we have had the car for about 3 years now. Its not a daily 
driver because we only take it out on the weekends or nice days.&gt;&gt;
Hi David,
First check that both of your valve cover gaskets are not drooping from the 
top of the cover.  If one droops enough to allow air inside this will 
increase air pressure in the crankcase.  Next it would be a good idea to 
check you compression.  If too low the escaping gasses around the rings could 
push oil up and out.  Of course this probably means time for an engine 
rebuild.  Are you running the thermostatic bellow flap system?  Have you 
checked your carburetor jets to make sure your rings have not been washed 
away due to too much fuel?
 
&lt;&lt;It has an aftermarket oil filler neck with the hose going up to the 
aftermarket paper air filter. That hose is clear.&gt;&gt;
We have never liked those paper air cleaners.  If you have the stock oil bath 
air cleaner sitting around you might be better off trying it on and see if 
that changes anything.
 
 &lt;&lt;Someone suggested to check the oil strainer. I will do that next I 
suppose. &gt;&gt;
If you mean the strainer in the bottom of the sump, it should have nothing to 
do with this problem of yours.   Eric&amp;Barb
