Need a bus to go with the parter?

I just heard that a '58 double door panel is FS in Placerville, CA.  
Don't have many details, but that's never stopped me before!  
So here's what I know (I'll get a phone number tomorrow):
'58 Double Door Panel, original, all there, bench seat
trashed, (unknown if rear seats there) rust along roof drip rail,
some in front floor, and along front (teller of tale not descriptive
and I can't translate his hand movements into words). 
Selling for $1800 (probably take $1500)
