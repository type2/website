&gt; In college, we did numerous dyno tests on vehicles and it really

&gt; 
&gt; The first important factor in keeping your heads cool is your fuel
octane
&gt; rating.  Even though most VW's will burn lower octane gas (cheap
stuff) if
&gt; you really want to extend your engine life and let it run a bit
cooler, run
&gt; the good stuff!!  Higher octane means slower burning in the
cylinders, this
&gt; not only lowers head temps, but also increases efficiency as well.  
This is true if your engine is detonating, but if it is not, then
lower octane gas works as well as the more expensive stuff.  As long
as the flame front proceeds across the combustion chamber in an
orderly fashion the head temps will stay low.  I also don't see any
connection between lower flame front speeds and increased efficiency. 
If you slowed the flame front too much, you would lower the cylinder
pressures and therefore the work extracted from the combustion gases. 
At normal flame front speeds, I don't think that you will see any
difference between regular and premium unless detonation is taking
place.

&gt; Around
&gt; this part of the woods, we have Amoco stations that have a 92 octane
gas
&gt; that is CLEAR.  The Amoco gas has been refined a bit more and a
number of
&gt; the floating particles that give gas a yellow color have been
removed.  By
&gt; running the clear stuff, your carb will run cleaner longer and you
will
&gt; develop less carbon in the heads.

May I point out that camping fuel is called &quot;white gas&quot; because it is
also clear and you wouldn't want to run that stuff in your engine!

The color in gasoline is caused by dyes, not by the refining process. 
Gasoline is dyed to aid identification and to increase customer
appeal. Back in the days when leaded gasoline was king, a red color
indicated that &quot;ethyl&quot; had been added to the fuel.

&gt; If you want really cool burning fuel,
&gt; try alcohol!  Alcohol has a very high octane rating and will not
carbon up
&gt; the heads.  Some race cars use it with great success.

Alcohol is great stuff, but it has about half the heat value of
gasoline, so your mileage will drop accordingly.

engine in college.
