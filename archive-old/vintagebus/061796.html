Subject: doglegs

Okay folks... Let's just suppose that I found a '59 or so 19 window. 
Let's further suppose that there's *no* rust in the doglegs.  Supposing 
that someone wanted such a thing, where would one cut to remove them? 
And, what would a fair price be for them?  (Rust free, passenger side a 
bit bent at the rear...)

Jim
