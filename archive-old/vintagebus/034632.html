&lt;&lt; I though about drilling it out. (need a BIG bit which might be costly)&gt;&gt;
Hi Richard,
You could get a 1/8&quot; cobalt drill bit and drill a line of holes across it.  
Then using a chisel you could crush it slightly and then turn it out.

&lt;&lt;Maybe drill a hole in it and tap it, double nut it and pull out?(wishful 
thinking?)&gt;&gt;
Probaly wishfull thinking.  This would work if you could first tighten the 
plug a quarter turn, but since it is a taper fit this would probably crack 
the reduction box.

&lt;&lt;Do what I do to get door screws out and weld a bolt to it? (Are the plugs 
steel?)&gt;&gt;
That could work.  Both the box and plug are steel.&gt;&gt;

 &lt;&lt;Replace the reduction box half? (messy and a lot of work) &gt;&gt;
Messy, yes, but not a lot of work.  That way you could work the plug out in 
nicer easier conditions in the workshop.  Plus you should be completely 
dissassembling the brake system and this would mean the brake drum would be 
off anyway.

    Above all do not use an easy out in this or any place where the threaded 
fastener is obviously stuck and thusly broken off due to corrosion.  
Easy-outs are good only in places where you know the threaded fastener is not 
frozen in place.
