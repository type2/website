Personally, I prefer mechanical methods.  All of my manifolds have an
access holes drilled in a place that allows straight access to the portion
under the carb.  I made a rotary scraper from a length of 1/8 welding rod
that does a pretty good job of cleaning the entire ID of the heat riser.

so, what do you use to plug the access hole you drilled?
..........
The problem with using a old speedo cable to snake through the heat riser
is that it doesn't clean the entire ID of the tube.  It'll ream a small
hole, but that hole will close back up pretty quickly.

right, that's why I use a clutch cable rather than a speedo cable.    A 
clutch cable it thicker, and made of many strands twisted together.  If you 
cut these strands so they are diff lengths, and bend them out a bit (like 
feathering its hair, okay)   it will eat away chunks off carbon off the 
inside of the heat riser, not just drill a small hole.   And turn the drill 
backwards, becaus eof the way the cable is twisted together.    

But Maybe I just dont feel like drilling and plugging holes.
