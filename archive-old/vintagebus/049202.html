Paul:

Another little trick that I've had success with in terms of getting the frames apart, which I would say is the hardest part to restoring a pop-out frame, is this:

Obviously remove the outer frame seal, or what's left of it.  Take a torch and heat up the screw heads.  Don't get them glowing, just heat them up a bit.  Then take a thin slotted screwdriver and lightly tap the screw head.  This usually breaks it free immediately.  Clara's suggestion of penetrating oil and tapping is also good, but does sometimes take several days and doesn't necessarliy always work depending on how crusty that area is.  Of course, my method doesn't always work either.

If you do end up needing to drill out the screws be very careful and really take your time.  The good news is if you do get off center a little you can always use a larger screw, 4mm, when you put them back together and no one is the wiser but you.

Robert
