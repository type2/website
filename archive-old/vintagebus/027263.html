Isaiah,

And once, I walked into a Trak Auto and bought a fuel cap for my VW
with my last $5. It was vacuum formed to cardboard and had my year and
model on it. Walked outside and tried to put it on and it wouldnt fit.
Went back inside, told the manager and he informed me that my beetle was
not the year I said it was. I informed him that I bought it NEW and he
didnt know what he was talking about. He refused to give my money back.
And this was when I was a poor college student, was working two jobs to
pay for my education myself and $5 was like a hundred to me. As you can
tell, I still havent gotten over it.

Lucky for me, a few miles later, I found the correct one lying in the
middle of the road!!!

Les
