List:

Like most things on my bus, the subhatch had been dismantled by the time I took ownership of it.  Thus, no record of how it is supposed to be mounted.

I have the new veneer panel, both hold downs and the prop installed.  What I don't know is what washers, grommets, spacers, etc. go on both the exterior roof side and interior side of the 4 hinge bolt studs.  Can any subhatch Westy owner out there give me a detailed description of the EXACT order of what goes when and where when mounting the hatch?  This would probably only be feasible if you've disassembled your hatch fairly recently.  For some reason I remember reading a post by someone a few months  ago that lead me to believe there are more metal and rubber washers up there than one would expect.

As always, TIA!

Robert
