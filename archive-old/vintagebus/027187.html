&gt; What they didn't do, for no obvious reason other than it might have
&gt; made things slightly more difficult for their photographically-
&gt; challenged camera man, was show *how* they'd attached the starter to
&gt; the engine.  For the whole shot, the camera was looking straight at
&gt; the back of the engine, from down near the floor, so you couldn't see
&gt; anything on the other side of the main shroud.

Ah...that would be the directors fault...if there was one!

Sorry. Just a camera man...oh I mean videographer's touchiness showing through.
