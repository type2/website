Subject: brake light progress

Well I guess I'm making progress on my lighting problems - I've got the lil'
bulbs in the front working and 1 brake light - but my passenger side brake
light doesn't work!  When the light switch is on all the lights work until I
step on the brakes - then the driver side brake light lights up and the
passenger side goes out - hmmmm.  Oh yeah, I don't have my license plate
light hooked up but I think I just need to connect the wire to the passenger
side tail light.
