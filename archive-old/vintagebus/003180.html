Subject: Fw: bleeding brakes

         Well today I was installing a new brake switch on my 57.I switched
 switches fast so as to not allow too much air into the system.I got the
wife
 out there to help bleed the brakes.This is one job on a car my wife has
 gotten very proficient at . Anyway, we start bleeding the brakes and I'm
 noticing a huge amount of air in the lines.I have flushed almost two quarts
 thru the system when I stop and realize something is wrong!
 Now the brakes were working fine before this, so what has changed ? I had
 all bleeder valves tight, except the far rear I started at.I kept the
 reservoir filled ! No leaks anywhere.I kept the hose submerged in the
 fluid.I thought about this for a while and came to the conclusion that the
 master cylinder plunger must have traveled farther in the mc than it had in
 a while, and hit some corrosion in the cylinder which f 'd up the
 the plunger and now shes sucking air ?! Does this sound right ?
     I guess this is better to happren on jack stands than on the boulevard
!
 Thanks for any thoughts !
