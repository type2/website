Howdy volks,

I was just reading Don J's post about his &quot;quick fix&quot; on the '66 that
has been off the road for two years, and how he was going to sell it to
work on a DC project.

Then it occured to me, like a jolt of inspiration, so-to-speak.  It
would be interesting to take a random sampling of this list and have
them &quot;shrinked out.&quot;  That is, given a full psycological profile by a
clinician. 

I bet you anything we are collectively in better mental health than a
random sampling of the general population.  Why?  'Cos we have a hobby
that we all love.  It is a great stress reliever, time occupier, and
provider of a general sense of enjoyment and satisfaction.  

Not that frustration never sets in.  

Any shrinks in the house, amateur or otherwise?

Best,

Curt'66 Kombi w/ '63 23 window rag top, DD
