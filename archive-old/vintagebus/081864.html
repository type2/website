&gt;&gt;  Hey VeeWee
From the best i can come up with it has to  be a 40 hp, an &quot;x&quot; as the last
digit usually refers to a 40 hp part. Could  be an early bastard forty.

Hi Bryan,
Doubt that is an official factory engine number for a Bastard  40HP engine.  
Especially since our parts books show that letter  designations before the 
engine # did not start till AUG65.  Having an &quot;X&quot;  at the end we have never seen 
on an engine ID number.
