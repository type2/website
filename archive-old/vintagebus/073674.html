Subject: Ribbed bus headlight lenses...

I am heading out the door to the Bow Wow Bug Bash in Bellevue WA and dug
out a set of ribbed european bus headlight lenses with really good
housings. I don't have a clue how much to ask? I also think someone was
making a cheap version of these, how do you tell the real from the
imitation? These have Hella stamped in the glass.
thanks for any quick answers,
Craig
ps - I also have a 40 horse bus aircleaner that I have been trying to
set a good price on.
