----- Original Message ----- 

&gt; &gt; I am having trouble with the idea that your oil gets  hot, but your
&gt;  heads don't appear to be getting hot.

This happens because oil temp primarily derives from engine speed, while
head temps come from engine load. There is very little connection between
the two that relates them to eachother.

It is somewhat common on a bus that is driving down the road at 4000rpm to
have the heads running cool as a cucumber while oil temps climb. This is the
only time I recommend an external oil cooler. You can get over 150 degree
oil temps by just spining a cam against the lifters with VW spring pressures
(just the cam/lifter friction alone). HD springs raise the oil temps too.

Cooling the oil does not affect the head temps, and cooling the heads does
very little for oil temps.
