Subject: Re: [VB] Petronix

I have a bunch of the 79 Cal/80-93 Cal Vanagon dizzys. The hard part to find
is the harness between the module and the dizzy.....
I see by you sig that you have buses with type1 engines. I would NOT use the
Vanagon electronic ignition set-up in a type1 engine. You would be in the
neighborhood of 38 to 43 degrees total advance. Way too much for a type1.
But if you want, I can send you more info on the swap. I have been putting
them in every 2.0L type4 engine I play with for the past 7 years....


&gt; ...Still thinking about the Vanagon dizzy swap if I can find one.  The
&gt; Rabbit and other VW sedan cars with the inline-4 do not use a dizzy that
&gt; will work due to the lower drive gear is different.
