i was scanning in some OLD hot vws articles tonight (they are going
to another listee w/ more storage space than i) and was amazed at all
the lil tidbits contained therein. ferinstanz.... the X on solex jets
indicates DIRECTION of gas flow!  'X' means the gas flows from the
jet head to the threads, and should be used in carbs w/ jet
carriers... no x means thread to head, no carrier. the little circle
around the jet face means .75 thread pitch; without is .80 and is
REALLY early.

fun stuff.

course, then there are the advertisement claims, like the one for the
WHIRR FAN... what looks like the lid from popeye's spinach can stuck
to the generator pulley! the idea is to cool the engine compartment
(and remove fingers) by stirring up the air in there because &quot;the
louvers in your deck lid are for heat to escape, NOT to let air in!&quot;
in light of our scoops discussion, i thought that was a pretty good
howler.
