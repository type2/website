This bus is still for sale.  I posted it before with some folks
interested..but I involuntarily went off-line for a short while after
that ...I am back on and now have pictures of the bus I can email to
interested parties.  

`62 VW Westfalia SO-33 Camper, factory hatch top.._dot_complete westy 
interior with all wood cabinets and ice box. Bus is not running but has
a 40hp with it.  I picked it up as an unfinished restoration...The body
is very rusty....ie. rockers, floors, doglegs and corners...the frame is
very solid.  The body of the bus is quite rough but savable, but
probably best as an excellent candidate for a transplant into a cleaner
bus.  I will be cutting up the body in the next week or so if I have no
interest by then and will be selling of the rest..ie. the complete
interior, other parts ect...  The bus has all new brake wheel cylinders,
hoses and lines, and a drag link about $300+ worth of new parts alone. 
I want $400 for the entire bus.  Email for pictures. Any and all trades
for VW items or old Schwinn Bikes or items are considered.

Todd S
