Subject: Re: [VB] Single cab authenticity
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19991226103913.00c0ceb0_at_pop_dot_calweb_dot_com&gt;

&gt;1.  bed slats--According to Meredith's &quot;Original VW Bus,&quot; pickups came with 
&gt;wooden bed slats.  My bed has no holes where these would be screwed down.  
&gt;Were the slats optional, only on certain years, what?

I've seen them both ways - maybe it was an option?  Most trucks I've seen
don't have them.

&gt;2.  bumpers--Did my single cab come with the plain strips, or were there 
&gt;overriders and towel bars (it is a US model)?  Did chrome bumpers ever
appear 
&gt;on trucks?  Regards repops, are there varying qualities as in beetles, or
are 
&gt;they all about the same?  Are original bumpers much more desirable?

You should have bows and overriders for a US model.  There are brazilian
bumpers out there, but I'm told there are some significant differences from
original.  I don't know of any repops.  Chrome bumpers would have been a
dealer thing, and I doubt anyone would ever have ordered a *truck* with them.

&gt;3.  I want safari windshields.  What should I know, like original vs. 
&gt;reproduction value and quality; more than one manufacturer?; also do I have 
&gt;to modify the wipers to use these windshields?

Authenticity costs money - how authentic do you want to be?  There are four
safari reproers that I know of; bus boys, wolfgang, izzies and creative
engineering.  Bus boys and wolfgang are just about identical, but are
nowhere near the originals, and use modified ventwing latches.  Izzy's look
closer to stock, and are a good compromise.  CE's safaris are supposed to
be the bomb, but they're also close to the price of the originals,
especially once you get them shipped over from England, where they're made.

&gt;4.  Tires--I just gotta have radial whitewalls.  From what I read, they 
&gt;should be 14&quot;.  Smaller sizes are hard to find, so how big a tire can I use 
&gt;(on stock steel wheels) without modifying anything?

Depends - are you going for the wide whitewall look, or just correct small
whitewalls?  THe normal ones aren't hard to find.  To get wide whites, you
have to go to coker tire
