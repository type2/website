&gt;I have this gizmo  that looks like a flasher that is wired up near the 
&gt;starter what is this?
 
you have a relay, this is to assist starter solenoid insofar as the
current path from battery to ignition switch ( and thru the tiny
switch contacts) and back to the starter must travel quite far
and through small gauge wire to pull in the solenoid and engage
the starter. the relay is wired to use the circuit for a signal path
to engage the relay, while the work is performed by additional 
shorter heavy gauge wire making a more direct path from the 
battery to the starter through the relay.
