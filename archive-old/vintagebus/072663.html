&gt; What better to keep the dashboard dry (safari) than a splitty towel.  I
&gt; posted this because I recently came across these and my wife bought some
&gt; for the big trip that starts (kinda) on friday.  Here is the link
&gt; http://www.rei_dot_com/online/store/ProductDisplay?storeId=8000&amp;catalogId=40000008000&amp;productId=47575410&amp;parent_category_rn=4500614

I was gonna say &quot;there's a hoopy frood who really knows where his towel is at&quot;
but I saw nothing split-like in that link, so I won't.
