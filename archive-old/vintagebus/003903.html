This morning I got up early and picked up my friend Shawn.  We headed out to
the bank for moolah and went to McDonald's for breakfast.  Due to a newbie
clerk's error, I went back and reclaimed my 70 cents I was overcharged. :-)
Then, it was time for business.  We donned our home-skillet caps (a big
white rag taped around our heads), face shields, shop aprons, socks with the
tips cut out to protect our arms, and double layers of rubber gloves.  We
were going to POR15 the entire front underside of the bus...and we
succeeded.  My sock protectors slipped down and so I got POR15 all over my
arms.  Then my face shield got in they way and I took it off.  My face is
now speckled and to top it all off, my home skillet cap fell off and I stuck
my head right into some POR15.  I didn't know it until I got home and ran my
fingers through my mane and they came out black.  Good thing I've got dark
hair.  I washed my scalp raw and then ruined a comb getting the hairs
straightened out.  Oh well, it'll wear off but next time  I'll get a
surgeon's cap and wear long sleeves.  I'll look like a dirty little boy
until this wears off though. :-)

Anyway, it took 2 guys from 9:30 until about 1:30 including clean up time to
do this job.  It's everything from the front bumper back to just behind the
axle tube cutout in the frame.  There are a lot of nooks and crannies but I
didn't get them all - most of them but just couldn't reach some areas.  I
actually ended up finger painting some areas that the brush wouldn't reach.

This afternoon I'll be working on that steering box and o-ring situation.

Thanks for reading...
