I made the Baywindow swap and I love the extra 5 gallons of fuel.  No one
but you will know that it's there.  If your making the swap I would go with
a baywindow tank.  A; it's &quot;still&quot; a VW part (better than aftermarket) B; it
holds extra fuel.  Just my opinion.

I will be needing a new tank for my '67 pretty soon.  What do you guys think
of the aftermarket ones?  I've heard that '67 is a single-year tank...yet
RMM carries one tank that fits the whole 55-67 range.
And no, I would rather not get one from a bay window!
Thanks,
