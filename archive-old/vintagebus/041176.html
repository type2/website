Hey Wes ,
    I just went thru this same problem with my Throw out in my panel.What I
found to be the problem was the surface of the casing for the bearing was a
little too wide where it fits into the forks, not allowing the throw out to
fully seat in the grooves in the forks.I took a small file and filed down
the surface of the casing where in comes in contact with the forks and the
throw out finally fit all the way into the forks and was centered and
swiveled like it should.
        Good Luck,


                 woody

&gt; I'm replacing the throw out on my van, and it just doesn't look right
after
&gt; I install it.  The spindle coming out of the transmission does not pass
&gt; directly through the center of the bearing.  It passes about a half inch
&gt; above the center of the ring...is this normal?  The number on the throwout
&gt; is EM 3159 140 037 from Sachs, and I'm installing it into a '70 Beetle
&gt; transmission number 113 301 183F.
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;
