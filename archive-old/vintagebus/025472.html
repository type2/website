Bryan,

My bus is not a show queen, nor will it ever be. I'm not preserving my
bus for a museum. I take care of it and enjoy it every day, and it will
probably die when I do. It's my daily driver, my hobby and my identity.
I've had to fix just about everything on it, from drivetrain to front
steering, electrical, body, you name it.

It's primer grey, got 15&quot; chrome wheels and big tires, an ugly black
homemade roof rack, a steelyerface on the front, and safaris. It's got a
complete, good westy interior in it, along with a wooden bead curtain
behind the front seats, and a pretty good stereo setup (needs new radio,
though!). It starts lots of conversations, attracts the attention of
lots of girls. It's not your father's Oldsm*bile!

I keep my safaris open pretty much all summer. For ventilation and
style, they can't be beat. If you've never ridden in a bus with safaris
wide open around a campground or show or around town with the stereo
playing and the wind blowing your hair back and a pair of dark
sunglasses on, watching everyone craning their necks to get a look at
you (including the girls!), then you might not understand. 

Yes, safaris are a lot of trouble. Yes, I do concern myself with rust.
Yes, I've gone thru a couple of stereos. Are they worth it? YES!
