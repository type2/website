Subject: Oil Filtration Question
Date: Tue, 1 May 2001 08:10:21 -0700

Hello!

I have been informed lately that I have to use a special oil pump and cannot
use my stock exhaust if I want to put a spin-on type oil filter on my
engines.  Is there a way to get around this?

Any suggestions?  I'm just running 1600's and I feel that a filter would
lengthen their lives.....

TIA
Gene
