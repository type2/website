No, this isn't a lesson in Eudora enhancment or a new fangled twist on tin
(you UNIX nuts remember that don't you?).  This is actually a simply way to
make your own thread cleaner.

When I POR15'd the brake drums for the 66 bus, I let the POR15 run down into
the threads for the lug bolts.  Don't ever let POR15 nor powdercoating ever
get on threads if you can help it - it must be cleaned before inserting the
bolt or you will strip threads.

When I asked the local guru for a tap to clean the threads with, he said he
didn't have one.  I didn't have $40 for a tap either so what was I to do?

Well you ever notice the slot ground in the sides of self tapping bolt or
screws?  I'm talking about that line that starts at the tip of the bolt and
runs partway up the side - perpendicular to the threads.  I have a 1 gallon
pail of assorted lugs so I found one that fit my bus.  Then I took the die
grinder and ground a nice slot up the side of the lug.  Next I took a
hacksaw and cleaned up the space between the threads.  PERFECT!

I started with a ratchet/socket and a can of 3 in 1 oil.  On the first hole,
I went about halfway before the bolt refused to go any further with mild
force.  I backed it out and there was so much gunk in the gap in the bolt,
it looked like it had threads!  The POR15 took the shape of the it!!!  I did
this on all 10 lug holes on the rear drums.  The worst hole took 5 to 6
passes to clean and the easist was one pass (all the way in and out.)  I
kept digging the gunk out of the bolt and everything cleand up great!

I even installed the tires and lowered the bus off the jackstands for a
minute so I could tighten and 'cotter-key' the axle nuts.  250 foot pounds
each later, the rear axle nuts were torked up.  Aside from painting the gas
tank, that was my evening...
