Funny? yes but what else can you do to stop these from leaking? a couple of
tubes of silicone would do it but then you wouldn't be able to open these
&quot;Safaris&quot;. There is no proper way to seal them, even factory ones. There is
no way to drain all that water since there is no room to install anything
except for big, ugly gutters and downspouts. Now, wait a minute, these
downspouts would have to drain somewhere too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, oh forget it. I
hope it's still Friday in CA so I can just get away with this.

Sorry, had to do it since personally I think that it's almost impossible to
seal these widows completely.

&gt; All the responses are crazy or being funny.  I still maintain that
replacing

can
&gt; just find a waterproof container for my registration and insurance card...
