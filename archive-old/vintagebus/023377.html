    Due to problems with the City of Tempe we are being forced to find a new 
location and date.  This causes problems as I am sure some may show up at the 
original location.  For this I am sorry.  If you feel you need to vent your 
frustration feel free to call the city and let them know.  I have.

    The new location as of today is looking like North Mountain Park.  The 
time will remain the same at 4:00 PM and the date will be pushed back to 
Saturday, May 20th.
I will keep everyone informed of any and all changes as they occur.  This 
date will remain the final date!!  Trying to squeeze this in before it gets 
too hot is becoming increasingly hard.

    This is my first time and I am now learning what troubles there are when 
putting on even the smallest event.  Thanks to 'Uncle' Jerry though for the 
help thus far. 

    Again I am sorry for any problems that this may cause and look foreword 
to seeing everyone there.

Drive Your VW.
