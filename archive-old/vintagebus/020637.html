The search &quot;porn and robert davis&quot; didnt' turn up anything, luckily!

Some of these strings become popular because they were the topic if discussion in one
forum or another; for instance, when RD uploads new pix of his bus, he posts to the list
and includes the URL http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/cgi-bin/gallery-search.cgi?string=robert+davis

It feeds on itself, because when other people see the most-recent list, they're curious about
this robert davis fellow, and click on it.

To see pix of aliens being smuggled in a single cab, crammed into the under-bed compartment,
go here: http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/cgi-bin/gallery-search.cgi?string=la+migra

&gt; thom's search engine on his web site reports the 35 most recent searches.  the most searched for word is &quot;porn&quot; at 4262 searches.  second highest is &quot;girl&quot; at 3156.  third is &quot;23 window&quot; at 3075.  draw your own conclusions.  this girl drives a commercial type 2 and enjoys a kind of porn few can appreciate.
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, what i found interesting is that the words &quot;robert davis&quot; were searched for 1616 times and &quot;national geographic&quot; 634 times.  i was surprised to see the phrases &quot;cal looker after the big resto&quot; (574 times) and &quot;pile of the month&quot; (832 times) with such high search numbers.  i wonder if i would work this into a library conference presentation on search engines and people's interests?  probably.
