I recently did the brakes in my 58 singlecab.....while the wheel cylinders 
are a little bit more $$ than a 66, I believe the 66-67 master cylinder is 
big $$$$.

My 58 prices......
German master cylinder 88$
Front wheel cylinders 28$ each times 4
Rear wheel cylinders, german,  26$ each times 2.
Brake hoses, german, 12$ each times four.
Brake pads, USA, 40$ four wheels.
Turning brake drums, 7$ each times four.

So theres about 300$ in parts alone.
Took me a day start to finish.

&lt;&lt;Hello I've been lurking for a while enjoying all the postings and I have

finally decided to get around to fixing up my 66 deluxe hardtop. Some of the

things like tune ups and replacing seats and trim I plan on doing myself but

I wanted a mechanic to redo the brakes. They are in need of new flex hoses

and slave cylinders. I took it to one guy and he told me it could cost up to

$700 to &quot;do the job right&quot; and that seemed on the steep side to me. Just

wondering if someone knew of a good mechanic in S.E. New Mexico and how much

something like this ought to cost.


Thanks
