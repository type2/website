A wood craftsman like Davis would look at the photos
and 'scipher it out in a Santa Barbara minute.

I think that item is the deluxe super custom Westfalia
toilet bucket for people who can crouch down really
small while doing their business. That kind of covers
the portapotty topic that I missed while camping with
several pre-seven year olds. I can't wait to get back
to work to get a vacation...

Question:
&quot;Shouldn't a porta-potty more accurately be called a
Porta-pooty?&quot;
Why do they call it a porta-potty when it would be
used mostly by the pooty-ownin' crowd? The bus fellas
that I know would just as soon pull over and open the
cargo doors to 90 degrees so traffic won't see and
drop trow while hangin on to the rocker panels... I
mean that's what makes I-10 the drive that we love so
well.
