Subject: EZ UP Canopy parts&gt; Who needed parts?

I dont pay as much attn to the threads as I used to.

There was a recent thread on one of the lists regarding where to obtain parts
for the EZ-UP style canopies.

This morning I rescued a canopy frame from the side of the road. NO canvas or
canopy top, some structure damage but main legs and many of the criss-cross
parts are still fine. Most/all of the grommets and hardware is available.

Available as a &quot;kind deed- friend in need&quot; sort of a deal. You need some of
this then perhaps I can help. Otherwise I will keep the hardware and main
chitlins for when my canopies get FUBAR.

Ronnie and or Kyle T have first dibs if needed by powerline damage.

Please advise.
-Ellis
