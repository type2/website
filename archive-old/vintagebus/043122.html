The only thing I noticed differently Eric in the parts required for the
M215 and the M216 that were any different than all the others listed were
the driven gear tooth numbers and the fact that only those two options
showed in parenthese the fact about mountain gearing.  The later redux
boxes speak of no special M option....
I don't follow what you're saying I guess.  
You say &quot;just like the later only a 24% reduction&quot;...so you really mean
exactly the same only different?  Huh?
Thanks, but now you have to give me even more info.

&gt; especially mountainous terrains. Right? &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Steven,
&gt; Actually they are geared just like the late 1964-67 standard reduction boxes 
&gt; with a 24% reduction.  Not at all like the mountain gears.   Eric&amp;Barb
