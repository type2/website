I don't know if the alloys are all that different.  One thing about HO cases
is that if they've been used in a bus all their life they are probably
getting pretty used up.  If a case hasn't been abused it can be ok no matter
what kind.
The A cases are two different alloys.  The AS-41 was used up until the fuel
injected beetles came out so in 75 I think they went to the AS-21 (AK?)
cases.  These are supposed to be alot stronger than the earlier AE cases
made out of AS-41.  If you get ahold of an AS21 case in good condition that
would make a great bus engine IMHO.  When they went to 8mm studs they went
to case savers I think?  If you have an H case that is good, go ahead and
use it.  Only H case I ever had had cracks in the bearing webs so you can
figure it saw some abuse.  The nice thing about VWs is you can keep
recycling things a long time until they are really used up, so I'd say never
throw away a case if it's good, whatever the designation.

-&gt;and.............
&gt;someone said that H cases suck.   No they dont suck.   They are great when
&gt;used, but they do not stand abuse as much as the later alloy used in the A
&gt;cases.  B cases are H cases with the bigger oil passages, BTW.   If you
&gt;overheat you H case the studs may pull out.   They don't if you don't.
(Or
&gt;the DPO).  Yes, an  A case is sturdier.  But Not all have factory installed
&gt;case savers, either, just certain ones (is it the AKs).    Yes, I would
prefer
&gt;an A  case, and that what I have in my 61.       I have driven many a mile
in
&gt;a H case, and proud.
