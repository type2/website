Subject: RE: [VB] Daily Driver Poll

From  late march to November  My kombi is pretty much my only car.  At one 
point I was putting 800 miles a week on it.  I do not think that anyone 
would drive an old VW on our winter roads if they liked not seeing the road 
through the holes in their newly rusted out floors.  The road commission 
literally puts over an inch of standing salt on the roads. Because if they 
do not use their alotted amount of salt this year they can't get more salt 
the next year even if they need it,  (typical gov't inefficiency)

You still have to drive home  through the same shit from the carwash, after 
washing it off!
