Subject: What type of early camper is this??!!
Date: Sat, 18 Jul 1998 17:21:51 -0700

&gt;It has a submarine hatch.  The interior is all white (and I mean ALL white)
&gt;formica which is what makes me think it is not a westy based on what I have
&gt;seen in the past. 

The www.type2_dot_com Type 2 Technical Resource Library has descriptions and
some pictures of the different camper interiors.  There is a picture of an
S034 white interior &quot;flipseat&quot; westy.

The S034 and S035's are rare enough that there is still some discussion
about the differences between the two.  

If you get a chance,  move the cab bench seat out of the way and take a look
at the m-code plate.  It is mounted under the cab seat on the passenger
side.

The camper may also have a model number plate in the engine compartment.
The plate would be on the passenger side near where the battery power cable
goes through a grommet to the starter.  The model number may have a dashed
extension that indicates the westy interior.  Something like &quot;23-34&quot;.
