Hello All,
 Ive been outside lookin at the '62 single cab till
the sun went down..... Hate this time change:) My
question to yall is, how do you think it should be
done? I mean when I look at a bus... the two tone
really looks good, set off the beautiful lines that VW
put in em. But not sure if two tone would look good on
a truck... colors are illrelavent at this point. Im
not a stock freak, so no flames please. just your
honest opinion on two toning a truck:)
Later

Is it true that cannibals don't eat clowns because they taste funny?
