Subject: The *original* 66 rear end.

Well tonight I tore apart the rear end of Daisy the 66 bus and as I
suspected.  It was totally original.  Every bearing was German and
everything looked great as a bus rear with only 99,000 original miles
should.  It's almost a shame that I had to take it all apart for the tranny
swap because you don't get any more original than this.

The axles and fulcrum plates as well as the side gears looked wonderful!
Ronnie at type2parts_dot_com told me a bus with that low of miles should have
good looking innards. Even the original color bands on the axles were
intact.  I simply pulled the snap ring out and moved the whole apparatus out
of one tranny and into the new one.  Compared to my old fulcrum plates and
axles, it's night and day difference - these things look great.

Anyway, if anyone is interested, I'm willing to sell the redux boxes with
ALL bearings in great shape (original German and as a side note, the stub
shafts barely wobbled when I took them apart - bearings are top notch with
no scoring or anything like that!),
original tranny (still works - the bus was only parked because it didn't
have a functional engine) but only minus a few parts.  I get to keep the
nosecone, axles, sidegears, fulcrum plates, etc., but I can toss in some
worn axles, fulcrum plates, and side gears to make a functional rearend with
no guarantee on the life of the parts.  The reason I'd like to sell all
these parts is so that I can get my new brake stuff.  (need the money)
Email me at silent_at_beatricene_dot_com if you are interested in this stuff.

To continue, I test fitted my 67 redux boxes to the tranny and man it's
gonna look nice.  The ability to cruise a little faster will be great as
well.  Ronnie tells me that the o-ring used on later swingaxle trannies is
NLA and suggested that I use permatex in this area.  I'd sure like to find
the o-rings though.  I measured with the calipers tonight and got this for a
measurement (slightly undersized I'm sure because I couldn't get the
calipers right where I needed them.):

Diameter 4.81&quot;/122.19mm
Thickness: .10&quot;/2.55mm

I'm gonna see if some industrial place has anything close - I doubt it but
it'll be fun looking.  One more thing that I noticed is different between my
old and new redux boxes is the way the bump stop mount on the axle tube
affixes to the redux box.  The older one uses 2 bolts and the 67 uses one -
a very minor change of course but VW must have had a pretty good reason for
this (saving money maybe?)

Guess that's it for now folks - thanks for reading!
