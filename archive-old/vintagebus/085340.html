Subject: Re: [VB] cleaning gauge faces..

Hi,

My gage has the same problem. I asked one of the guys that does the speedo 
restoration and he said to live with it. Once you open the front bezel by 
prying up the chrome ring, it doesn't go back very nicely.

Anyone have  better information?

Chris

 Hi!  Anyone know how to clean the inside glass face of a fuel gauge
 without damaging it???  The dust has collected on it and won't leave!!
