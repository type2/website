Subject: Insurance insights-Stated Amount policies

Regarding the &quot;Stated Amount&quot; insurance policies, VanBondo sez:

I had the '67 RFH appraised by Dan Lawson, owner, operator of Competition
Engineering, Tempe, AZ. CE is an established spot which does pro vintage
restos among other services all the time. There are other local VW
enthusiasts who offer appraisal services. Check with your insurance carrier
as to what they accept as a &quot;qualified appraiser.&quot; Check with as many
sources as you feel comfortable but make sure that the insurance carrier
recognizes the appraiser's validity. Make sure that the person(s) doing the
appraising is/are thorough and have knowledge of *current* market values. 

My State Farm agency advised that I have copies of all of the reciepts etc.,
as Craig Sauls mentioned, plus a formal written appraisal that has been
completed by a professional/qualified appraiser.

I also video taped the crap outta the bus. Every angle inside and out, top
and bottom. Interior details, engine details. All with a voice over of the
various detailed aspects that I knew about the bus~that others might
overlook. Have the time stamp flying on the video. Send all copies to the
Insurance rep and specifically request a policy for &quot;stated amount coverage&quot;
at the appraisal price. Dont forget the tent and other vintage items that
you might carry with you on long runs and campouts.

The concept of &quot;Antique Vehicle&quot; insurance pops up on the email list(s) when
a thread like this comes around. This coverage is very cheap but places
strict restrictions on the usage of the vehicle. In this type of policy,
coverage only is in force if the vehicle is in transport or in transit
(being driven) to and from the event or is secured at your home/main storage
base. If you stop off at Sister Sue's or the local Rip 'n' Split Market for
a quart of milk you might encounter a hassle from the insurance company.

We use our buses on a daily grind so the antique thing is out for us. As
always CYA and check with your local insurance provider.

Recently, a friend from NorCal asked about this very subject. I suggested
that she take her purple pride and pleasure to Gary LaVere at 
LaVere's VW Restoration, 3503 Pacheco Blvd. (New address as of 5/1/98)
Martinez, California 94553 (San Francisco Bay area)
Website:  http://www.vwrestorations_dot_com  
email:    &lt;glavere_at_vwrestorations_dot_com&gt;
Located in NORCAL, 20 miles east of Oakland near the Benicia Bridge off of
Hwy 680.
