Volks,

I have been trying to get hold of a Dr. Joe at 'All Bugs' for more
information on what is reputed to be a robust Type II tow bar.  I've called
(602)997-7345 many times in the past few weeks and left more than enough
messages.

Sure would appreciate a web link, email address or even post office address
if you have one.  You'll be helping out a GA listee (Andrew Whitlock) as
well as me, if we can work out the details.

Thanks,
Doug Lloyd
