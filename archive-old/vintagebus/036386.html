I have a question that I keep hearing mixed messages about! 
Here is goes, 
I am 15 years old. I DO have a job, but I don't get a lot of money. About $50 bucks a week. 
I have a 1967 Volkswagen Kombi. The body is straight, but it needs a few things.
ALL the rubber, ALL the doorpanels, the headliner, the carpet and seat appulstry. As you probably know, $50 bucks a week will not suffice.
So almost everybody had been telling me &quot;don't buy from JC Whitney, only buy quality stuff.&quot; I have also heard that &quot;JC Whitney is great, always ontime!&quot;
But most people want me to buy from the really expensive people, they say it is better quality. Now I want to have a nice car! Is there a healthy meet you in the middle for this situation? What about bus depot? They have good prices.
Anyway, please respond and give me your thoughts.

-Gabe
