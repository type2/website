Subject: RE: [VB] pressed bumper questions

&gt;hi, can somebody please educate me about the differences between pressed=

rear bumpers, like barndoor / post barndoor, or are all of them the same?=

&gt;
The rear is the same.  The front has the license plate area a little bit
smaller (longer ribs) on pre-March, '56 Buses.

It should fit fine.

Not sure about your brackets, I think mine hit the bumper everywhere.  It=
's
hard to tell if they are just a little tweaked unless you have something
to compare against.

Everett
