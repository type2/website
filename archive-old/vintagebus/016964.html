Ok.  A few more details, please:

- what fuse does the stereo tap off of (the one that heats up, some
  other one, taps off before the fuse box, ...)
- does the heating up occur with: everything off, key on &amp; everything
  else off, key off &amp; headlights on, key off &amp; brake lights on, key
  off &amp; stereo on, key
  off &amp; headlights on &amp; brake lights on, key on &amp; headlights on, key
  on &amp; brake lights on &amp; stereo on, ....  Basically, what combinations
  of things get the wires to heat up?  You'll probably need a helper
  for this one

The odds are good that the insulation on some wire's worn through.  We
just have to isolate it down to what area that wire's in.  Ideally, it
only happens when some particular thing is on.  If it happens when
nothing except the key is on, that tells us a lot, too.

Also, please let us know the chassis number of your bus, so the
correct diagram can be referenced.  Just for double-checking said
correctness, how many fuses do you have, and which end does the main
power come in at (door-side or center-side, top or bottom) when
viewing the fuse box in its normal position?
