Subject: Tranny locks up in reverse?

I have a small nut tranny that will only *sometimes* lockup the wheels after you start going in
reverse. Especially if you start out in reverse for a bit then push the clutch pedal, thats when i
really notice it, the rear wheels sometime voilently lockup the second you push the pedal down. I
drove that bus for years with no problems, but I rarely went in reverse. Never any problems in any
other gears. Just started driving it again so it reminded me of the problem. Is it just a bad center
section or could it be something else? If it is a bad center section, what exactly causes that
symptom?

thanks for any input
