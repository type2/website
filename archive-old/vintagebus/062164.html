Subject: Re: [VB] Restoring front beam and greasing it!

&gt; &gt; First I will start with the greasing part as thats easy - when I grease 
&gt; &gt; should I first be wiping off the excess grease that is pushed out of the

&gt; &gt; seal or should I wipe it off after filling them up?
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; Kind of depends on wether you or the DPO greased the front beam, link
pins, 
&gt; and king pins at least every 3,000 miles or six months which ever came
first.

I don't think he did - one of the king pins had to be adjusted for its
yearly test however since I have owned it I have greased it twice - when I
got it and then after 1250 miles.
 
&gt;  Make sure to have the front of the bus jacked up till the front tires are

&gt; just off the ground to allow grease to push into several of the king pins
&gt;   If not done then the grease is going to be old (Making it thin and
soupy.), 
&gt; dirty, and possibly water filled.  If so you will have to pump grease and 
&gt; keep wiping up the nasty old stuff till new grease flows out.

I think there is still some nasty stuff there so I will have to do that.

&gt; &gt; I am considering removing my front beam to restore it, as the floor
above it 
&gt; &gt; needs cleaning up as the cover plate is missing and if the beam is off
then 
&gt; &gt; it will make the job easier.
&gt; &gt; What is involved in restoring the beam, should I just sandblast it and
get 
&gt; &gt; it painted or powdercoated?  Are there any bushes that I should replace 
&gt; &gt; whilst it is off?  Is there anything else I should consider replacing at

&gt; &gt; the front end whilst I do it?

&gt; If you are going to sandblast, paint or better yet get it powder coated 
&gt; depends a bit on which year front beam you have.  It will have to be 
&gt; completely dissassembled and degreased.  Check your VW bus shop manual for

&gt; your year front beam for more info.  

My bus is a 66 and I have the Bentley manual - does this have details on
whats involved (haven't got it with me).
Powdercoating is as easy for me to get done as painting so I will go that
route - I expect the complete dissassembly and degreasing won't be that easy
though.

&gt; As for replacing, it mostly depends on 
&gt; what is bent or worn out.  Do make sure the front beam is straight before 
&gt; restoring it and replace all rubber seals while it is apart.  

How do I ensure that the beam is straight - is this a procedure in Bentley
(I know I should of looked before I asked).
Another point is how do I keep the bus in the air to remove the beam.  My
bus seems pretty solid - but I wouldn't want to use the jacking points as
they are definately replacements.  To raise the front I normally use the
beam so I am going to have to find something else - could I use the chassis
rails along with wood to spread the load and axle stands?

Thanks for your help
Paul
