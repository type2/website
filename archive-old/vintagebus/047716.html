Hi Aaron,
Does he mean the slider glass for the front doors?

&lt;&lt;With this, only the later 66 and 67 doors will fit but be different in 
there mechanics (Door handles and the such).  Is that right?&gt;&gt;
As we know it the NOV63 to AUG67 doors are the same, and if the slider glass 
was different the whole frame unbolts from the top of the door.

&lt;&lt;If so how do I recognize these from the earlier doors?  If the door handles 
are different for the 65, how do I recognize them? &gt;&gt;
The only difference is that the up to NOV63 the exterior door handles flip 
out ward to open the door.  From there on until AUG67 the exterior door 
handles have push buttons to release the the door latch.  The only other 
difference we know of is that the key pattern changed from the &quot;T&quot; key 
pattern used from Nov63 to about AUG66 and for the 1967 production year there 
was a one year only set of locks using the key pattern that was used on into 
the late model buses.    Eric&amp;Barb
