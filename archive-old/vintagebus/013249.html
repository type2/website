I have a faint memory of an antenna that consisted of a fairly thin 
strand of copper wire wound on a length of nylon line, making it fairly 
easy to set up the antenna at night, and to real it in when making camp. 
But I didn't see such a thing at Radio Shack.  Does anyone know where to 
get one?

Mark
