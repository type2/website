To add my 2 cents to the discussion:
At recent energy fairs (Midwest Renewable Energy Fair,
Amherst,  Wis) there have been some bicycle-style
genereators, using bicycle frames to provide a
suporting structure for a pedal power generating
system, and they were using newly rebuilt 12 volt VW
generators  from upright engines.  They were set up so
that interested spectators could get on  and pedal,
and they were hooked up to a panel of different light
bulbs that could be switched  to vary the load.  They
worked quite well, and were effective in demonstrating
how much work is involved in producing electricity in
usable amounts.
There might be links to similar kinds of pedal powered
generators at Home Power (http://www.homepower_dot_com).
My personal choice for supplying small amounts of
power at a camp site, etc., would be a solar panel or
two, instead of a stand-alone genereator with engine,
with possible connections to the vehicle to use it's
charging system to recharge a battery if it isn't
sunny enough.
Of course, this is also my preferred way of providing
power at home, along with wind-powered generating
systems, which require more maintenance, but are lots
cooler to watch.
