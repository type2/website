Subject: Picture of Mark without Ol'No Name

Hi Real Bus People   Working on the seats for Ol'No
Name what a mess.The cover on the drivers side are
gone just pieces hanging on the seat frame.That
horsehair padding for the back piece has a German
looking white sticker on it...just cant make out the
wording.                                  I dont have
a digital camera so it is not easy for me to get a
broken bus and me on the site soooooo.Just incase you
wonder what this old man looks like try this link    
http://community.webtv_dot_net/DakineYaMan/MarkmissingOlNoName
                                                      
                   Maybe it will work I dont know...I
put a high number on the counter(not high enough) to
see if you just might get your bus year when and if
you take a look.It's me on my bike...hair pulled back
and my mustache is missing but it's me.Great just what
you wanted!!!...I was out of state on a ride(with
boots) and went to see if that insurance man with a
camera would take a picture for the folks back home.  
            Ol'No Name is in the driveway needing a
new engine and other things but I am working on her
little by little....Got most of the rust slowed down
with a rust converter,rattle can stuff....well sorry
about the lack of bus stuff.

Mark and his under-repair...by me...poor thing..67 Deluxe walk thru 13 window Ol'No Name in San Luis Obispo,Calif...7 miles to the ocean! Sea-Ya (:}
