Subject: Another goody...parts number help please....

Scored what looks like a brand new rear bus drum for '63-'67. The box has 
no identifiers other than this part number:

211 501 615 G

I can't find any brand or country of origin or anything on the box or 
actual drum.

Here's some pictures of it: http://www.type2guy_dot_com/temp/drum/

Any info appreciated.

p.s. Anyone who wants to buy it email me an offer. Don't ask me how 
much...just email what it's worth to you. Otherwise I'll just stick it on 
eBay. Would rather just sell outright here and avoid that.
