&gt;If we are talking about rarity, what about the 15 window?
&gt;
I wouldn't use the term &quot;rare,&quot; unless we are talking about a ribbed bumper
walkthrough 15-window, of which I have seen 3 real ones and a few fakes.

I submit to you the following order:
15-window Deluxe
23-window Deluxe
21-window Deluxe
13-window Deluxe

Walkthroughs are more desirable and less prevalent.
