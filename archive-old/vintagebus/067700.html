&lt;&lt; If we are discussing rear hatch hinge covers......
 Then if I remember correctly, my old 65 Sundial had
hinge covers on 
it, and 
it was a walkthrough panel camper conversion.
 At least there were large remnants of dried out hinge
covers in it.

My 67 Sundial which is converted from a 13 window bus
has hinge covers.
