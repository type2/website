&gt; &gt;As gas prices inch upwords I was just toying with the idea of replacing my
&gt; &gt;daily driver F**d with something cheaper (gas-wise). Passatt would be nice -
&gt; &gt;if it would have TDI in it..
&gt; 
&gt; If a Jetta is too small, then this may not work, but if you want mileage
&gt; and reasonable room, do like I did and go buy a Toyota Prius.  I get
&gt; about 42-46 highway and about 44-48 city.

Before you get carried away on this concept, do a bit of math.  It takes a
lot of miles to reach the breakeven cost point where the fuel savings
equal the cost premium of the vehicle.  My students did a cost comparison
of the Honda hybrid versus a Honda Civic using EPA mileage numbers.  At $2
a gallon, the breakeven
point was 700,000+ miles.  To get a breakeven point of 100,000 miles the
cost of fuel would have to go up to $12 a gallon.

Better to restore a bus, and with the money you saved from not buying a
new car take a few trips around the world!
