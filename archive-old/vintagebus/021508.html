 My fiancee and I recently purchased a '66 split window.  Since then we have
been trying to sort through the many models of the bus.  My question is
actually pretty easy.  We havn't been able to figure out what the differences
between a combie and a microbus is.  We've seen pictures of both, and they
look fairly similar.  
 
  &gt;&gt;
two ways to find out-

look above your head- if it has a headlkiner it is a microbus, if it has
paneling above the drivers head it is a combis.  Neither left there\?   look
at the sides of the overhead air vent- little clip claws- these are for the
headliner its a microbus- a horizontal channel in threre- it's for the panel
to slide into- a kombi

also- look atthe side of the fresh air vent for the aluminium tag- it will say
type 2X  somehwere on it.

a type 21 is a panel
type 22 a micro
type 23 a kombi
types 24/25 are deluxe micros
type 26 is a truck
type 27 is an ambulance.
type 28 standard micro with sliding sunroof


go nuts!

then you can explore the M code tag for more info- such as options and
origianl colours
.........
also- what I forgot to mention before.  you are talking commercial vehicles vs
passenger vehicle here- commercial are types 21, 23, 26, 27- and also have all
the heat going to the front- while passenger type 2s have heat in front and
coming out under the rear seat-
