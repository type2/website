&gt;Yes! I knew it!
&gt;
&gt;Now where does one find them! ;-)


I saw an NOS ribbed truck rear bumper at the SOTO meet the VW Classic
weekend. Guy was asking $600.00. Also asking $600 for the brackets. Only
sold as the set he said. That makes, let's see, too fricking much money for
a bumper! I also know a feller what has a slash style truck bumper, but if
he were to sell it to any of you before me, there would be a small killing.
Not a big one, understand, just a small one. They are around in the arid
southwest. Just so as you all know what you missed, the 58 single cab that
was the object of the parting out thread that went nuts a week or so ago had
a very straight ribbed rear truck bumper on it complete with truck splash
pans. One ding. The whole truck sold for less than some people think the
front and rear bumpers would have been worth. The world is somehow a nicer
place just knowing this, isn't it?
