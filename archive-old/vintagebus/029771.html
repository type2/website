Subject: What went on upper rear interior? (was re: Interior door panel Q)
References: &lt;200011011839.KAA34783_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

&gt; If you're talking about the (approx.) 3 foot long, 10&quot;
&gt; high panels beneath the windows (non-walk through, so
&gt; no spare tire back there), yes, same material as the
&gt; top of the door panels (at least it's so on my mesh
&gt; grey interior) no beading stapled to the top, though.

This relates to a Q I've been meaning to ask.  (1965 bench-front
standard, 3 windows along the side, mesh grey interior.)  What covered
the &quot;fourth side window&quot; area on these busses, behind the back seat and
above the beltline?  Vinyl perf headliner material, like what's glued to
the metal surrounding the side windows?  Any backing?  

Mine's bare (and no panels in the area below the beltline there, either
-- which sounds like it would have been this grey hardboard/masonite
stuff).
