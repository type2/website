Just got back the B.C. for my panel bus from germany today. Seems they show
it as right hand. Does this mean right hand drive? If so looks like someone
converted mine from left to right. Sure this is wrong, so will send another
$20 and have search done again. Check out the Jerome Jam story by UJ in the
latest VW Trends. VWHoward is in there and so is cousin Willie.

I know this is early but, Tacos by LBB's Friday night at Jerome X. Also any
listies coming from So Cal or Northwest who want to break up the drive, you
are invited to stay at my house in LHC Thurs night and join the caravan from
Havasu to Jerome early Friday morning. We will arive at Jerome around noon
and all will be put to work setting up the site before the beer and tacos
flow. L:et me know
