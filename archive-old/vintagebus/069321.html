Subject: Sub hatch in 1965?

I was told by a guy that he has a 1965 sub-hatch? I thought '65 Westies were So42/44's. Here is what he said:

thanks for the info...the bus it is on is a 65 westy sub hatch...when they made the switch to the pop top mid 65 they went to the bid top drive-away style tents.

Wouldn't the change to the pop-top have been made mid '64 for the '65 model year? My bus was made in 4-65 ( if I remember correctly) and is a pop top with late rear bumper!

Sean

 


To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other.
