&lt;&lt; I wanted advice if this was worth it or if a portable propane heater would

with $5 j tubes from a swap

Hi John,
In the long run it is both cost effective and much safer to just install a 
good set of heat exchangers on your engine!  Then if you still feel the need 
of a boost of heat now and then or when you go well below 40F outside you 
could get a properly designed gas Eberspaker or South Wind gas heater.  Talk 
to Robert Keezer of WarmerWagen_at_aol_dot_com about getting one he has gone through 
already.
