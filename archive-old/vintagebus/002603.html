Subject: Pennies under the floor

When I pulled the interior out my new 65 EZ Camper, I found a pint glass
full of change, and some ohter little medallions.  Most are so full of crud
and oxidation that i Couln't make head or tails out of them.  I poured some
stop n' shop cola into the glass, and am now waiting for results.  I vaguely
remember a summer camp trick where you put an old penny in a glass, the dude
poured something in (Alka Seltzer?) and a while later, you had a shiny
penny.  Any thoughts or rememberances?  The earliest one I've found so far
was a 1967 Denver, screwed into the floor under the mat between the front
seats.  This kind of stuff gets my wife interested our &quot;fifth car!!!&quot;
