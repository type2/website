Subject: Identifying a genuine sundial conversion

Hello VB list...

I recently bought a '63 bus. I am hoping someone can tell me if there is 
a way to positively identify a Sundial conversion.
I'm not sure if this conversion was done by sundial or a hack by a 
previous owner. The bus definitely started its life
as a panel and the cuts for the windows are not the cleanest. I've heard 
that the sundial wasn't the cleanest camper conversion.
There is nothing left of the interior behind the front seats.

I'm almost 100% sure that the windows on this bus are from a sundial.  I 
appreciate any help.


The pics can be seen at:

Thanks!
