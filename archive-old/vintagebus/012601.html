hey all,
Removed the damn thing!
i found the hot lead for the turn switch... the last one i checked,
the black with green and white DNA chain on it :) ran a line from my
new fuse panel to this wire. the wires from the switch and the turn
signal itself come together and go to the hella relay (one pair for
left, one pair for right). i separated them and put on either terminal
of a 99¢ 12V relay. voila turn signals! i won't have hazards or
brights though, oh well. the PO put in a flip toggle switch working
the headlights, i ran a wire to the other wires on the tails, voila
tail lights. now i just have to get the brake lights working, ran out
of wire, i'll try that tomorrow.

Thanks to all who responded!!
anyone want to email me the correct way to wire the factory headlight
switch?
