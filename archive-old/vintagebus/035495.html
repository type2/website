 I'm STILL trying to sort out the tranny differences.  Here is what I think I
 have figured out...  This is a quiz, can someone confirm the answers?
 
 Small Nut / Large Nut has NOTHING to do with Transmission!  Although people
 say &quot;small nut tranny&quot; they are really talking about the Axles / Reduction
 boxes.   --- Correct?
 
 The center section is the &quot;split case&quot; part -- Correct?  Is the change from
 &quot;split case&quot; to &quot;tunnel&quot; the same as the Reduction box change?  Or am I
 confused on center sections (yes) ?
 
 Small Nut is '63 and down, Large Nut is '64 - '67.  Small nut has smaller
 brakes and uses 1.39 ratio reduction boxes.  Large nut has 1.26 ratio.
 
 You can put the center section of a '64 - '67 on a '63 and down?  What the
 heck is the difference, if any?
 
 There are differences in how the front (FIF) of the tranny mounts to the
 body and connects to the shifter linkage?  Can anyone summarize these
 differences (relative to year to year)?
 
 ============== &gt;&gt;
here we go-
50-mid 53
crash box tranny- center section has a split case and no synchros- reduction
gear boxes are 36mm and barndoor only w/ 1.40 redux

mid 53- end of barndoor in 55
split case center section with synchros in 2nd 3rd 4th,  the reduction gear
boxes are 36mm nut and barndoor only w/ 1.40 redux

55-mid 59 (used till end of 36hp buses)
center section is split case with syncros 2nd 3rd 4th (same as later barndoor)
but the reduction boxes have changed to the post BD type w/36mm nuts and the
1.39 reduction gearing

mid 59 through 63  
center section is tunnel case with ? 4.12 r&amp;p (i have heard differnt things
about this) reduction gear boxes are 36mm with 1.39 reduction gearing

64-67
center section is tunnel case w ?4.375? r&amp;p (I have heard different things,
and it may be different for 67and or 66 than the 64/65) 
reduction boxes are bigger nuts with 1.26 reduction gearing.

split case trannys, whether crash box or the syncronised version have the same
nose cone.  This is different than the nose cone of the tuncase tranny.   A
split case tranny is split done the center from front to back as it sits in
the bus- just like the engine case   If it has a row of bolts holding the two
halves together it is split case.   These require a full and complete stop to
go into first and reverse because of the lack o synchros.  Never drove a
crashbox, but hear it is a chore.  Anyway, to put a tunnel case tranny in a
split case tranny bus, you need an adaptor plate, as where the nose cone bolts
up it is different. Tunnel cases are a tunnel, with a gear section that bolts
on the nose end- two tunnels.  It is the same as a bug, has bug part numbers
on most of the bits, but the ring gear is swung around.  

axles- you can swap axles and the r.gear boxes (RGBs) from center section to
center section.  what is on there may, or may not, be original. but small nut
tranny is generall 63 and earlier, and big nuit 64-67,   Later trannys tend to
be geared higher.  The RGBs have gearing and definately affect the gearing of
the bus.   Barndoor RGBs bolt on differently than the post BDs types, as they
improved the system there.   FWIW, BD spring plates are a shoddy design and
tend to wear out- barndoor drivers check them for play and clunkage!  You can
bolt either small nut or big nut post barndoor RGB into your post barndoor
bus.
yes- the 59-63 brakes are smaller than the 64-67 brakes, and your front
suspension should match, for safer braking esp in emergency situations.

To go faster, you want a higher final drive (3.88 is higher than 4.12 is
higher than 4,.37)  the actual gears can be different too.  Then you want 1.26
RGB rather than the 1.39s.

To climb the hills, you want lower gearing, say a 4.37 with 1.39RGBs and you
get a top speed of about 50mph ish

hope this helps some
