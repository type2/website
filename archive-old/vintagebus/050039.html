Subject: Re: [VB] Manifold Destiny

&gt;The set up you are looking for is from early type 3. There was a year
&gt;possibly two (makes 'em hard to find) prior to the injection that had dual
&gt;Solex.

'66 and possibly '65 had the dual carbs (on U.S. models) on single port
heads.  '67 Type 3's had the first use of the dual port heads, still using
the dual Solexes.  '68 was the debut of the much hated electronic fuel
injection, featuring a cumputer w/out any chips, but with lots and lots of
transistors...
