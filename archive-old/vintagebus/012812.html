hey, I have a 67 deluxe and I am having problem with first and second gear
along with reverse.  It is incredibly hard to find first and at a stopped
position you have to use way to much force to get it in gear.  Although, if
you are moving at 5 mph, then it slides into first with no problem.  Second
is just very rough and you hear a loudish click when it finally gets in
gear.  Reverse is bad too because every time I try and put it in reverse, it
screeches and sounds like crap, like the grooves are still spinning.  And if
I try to force it into reverse sometimes it kicks it out of gear.  Third and
fourth are like a dream compare to these three, so if anyone has any
helpfull advice, I would love to hear from you.   Thanks for your time,
peace out
mark
