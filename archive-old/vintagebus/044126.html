&gt; This is hopefully an easy question, but I could not find an answer in the archives.

Does an early bay Z-bed fit into a split?  
-----------------------------------------
Yes, A splittie is a bit wider on the inside so you can put a bay bed and cabinet in and there will be a little gap on the sides to lose things in :)Bay cargo area seats will fit as well. If you have a deluxe split with the heat log under the rear seat you will have to cut the bottom of the bed out. 
----------------
I think the interior code should be SO-44, the most common one, with the clothes cabinet next to the Z-bed with the yellow vinyl covers.  If I understand correctly the SO-44 ran from 65 to at least 72.
---------------------------------------------------------------
It is SO42 for the splits(1964? to 1967) and SO69 for the the bays. The laminate material is the same until 1972 model years when it changes to a darker color. The fabric changes from vinyl to some form of Herculon in 1973 but it similarly colored.1974 and 1975 Westys are a departure and 1976 to 1979 are totally different. I would love to shove a 1976 and up Wesry interioir into a split and see if it fits.

There are other splitscreen Westy interiors including SO32,33,44. Chech the type 2 Library for details.Other bay include SO67.

PS.  I have no idea who this Mirvis character is,

This must have been before my time or I was having a delete button day :) I checked the archives and did not find the rant that was mentioned. I did find a lot of praise the business practices of the Mirvis character and then suddenly nothing.
