Okay, I did a dumb thing. 

The little black bakelite tip on my turn signal assembly was always
coming loose, so I gave it a good turn the other day. As you may guess,
the end of it broke off right where the threading stops. 

I saved the piece that cracked off and was wondering if it could be
repaired? Are replacements growing on trees? Do I hit the elusive
boneyard?

Thanks, ~Rich
