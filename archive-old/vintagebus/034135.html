I stock 2 different brands of oil pressure switchs, AUMA and HELLA, both
made in Mexico, I have had very little trouble with these, Hella being the
most problems, I have had German Hella and found these to be repackaged
Mexican switchs for a lot more money. Porsche 356 pre A (used 36 hp block)
had an oil pressure switch that you were able to calibrate, but if and when
you find these they are pricey, check out Ebay 356 Porsche, I always seem to
find some good deals on crossover parts there.

When my 1600 SP engine was rebuilt a couple of years back we went through 6
[six!] defective oil pressure senders before finally getting a good one
[number 7].

Every single one was a German part, new in the box.

&gt;&gt;  I put a NOS screw-terminal oil pressure switch in my Bus and now the
light comes on after driving on the freeway for a while.  The oil is fresh,
Bus just tuned and valves adjusted, dipstick is actually cool (for once),
drives normally.  Weird, I think I got a bum switch...  &lt;&lt;
