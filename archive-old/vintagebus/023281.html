No, he has a big box of them and is selling them one by one.  I know Larry
personally, and he's a nice guy.

It's a good idea before bidding on something to check the completed
auctions and see if any similar items have sold recently, and for what
amounts.

Shipping to Canada is only a pain insomuch as the extra customs form you
have to fill out, and then wait forever for it to get there.  I sent a
small package to another Canadian listmember, and it took over 2 months to
get there.  It would have been faster to deliver it myself...
