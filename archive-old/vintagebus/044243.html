&gt; &lt;&lt; If the clutch is properly adjusted, you won't need any clips at all, once
&gt; hte
&gt; motor is installed -- there shouldn't be enough room 'twixt TO bearing and
&gt; pressure plate to allow it to fall off...   &gt;&gt;


&gt;
&gt; Also having
&gt; the bearing in contact with the pressure plate constantly will wear out the
&gt; bearing prematurely.  This is why VW had the bearing adjusted to keep it
1/8&quot;
&gt; away from the pressure plate and strongly advised against resting your foot
&gt; on
&gt; the clutch pedal.    Eric &amp; Barb


I would think in the pre '71 models that the bearing is always in constant
contact with the pressure plate, even if it is just the top or bottom edge --
just touching, not under any pressure.  Unless the bearing is magically
balanced, it will tilt forward and backward, bringing one edge in contact. 
This may be one reason VW decided to add the cost and complication of the tube
mount to later transmissions -- the pedal release will now draw the TO bearing
away from the PP evenly so there is no touching.
