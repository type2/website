Weve been having this conversation at the PAVanagon list.  Apparently this
brand of heater is specifically designed for closed space and has its own
oxygen sensor.  http://www.mrheater_dot_com/buddy2.htm

$100 or so allegedly at Home Depot and those kinda places.  Uses 1 lb 
propane bottles.  Only drawback seems to be that it uses one up in 3-6
hours.  It also has the potential of turning your bus into a sauna.  Hot
rocks and water ladle not included.

Guys, I know (Knew) a guy who died by using a catalytic heater in his VW
bus. If
you want to use one that is not vented, DON'T! Especially if you have one of
those rare, well sealed busses.....

&gt; Low oxygen and carbon monoxide alarms/detectors would still be a very good
&gt; idea for backup protection.
