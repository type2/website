&gt; &lt;&lt;Type 4 is the way to go for more power and retain reliability. Search
&gt;
&gt; When this type 4 engine discussion first came up, I emailed the grand
&gt; guru Bob Hoover to find out what he thought. One dooood on the list had
&gt; already done the conversion and had glowing revues that it was the best
&gt; thing since sliced bread. And it sounded so nice, all that power and
&gt; reliability. But then Bob Hoover threw his big ole monkey wrench into
&gt; the gears. He said that due to the increased torque that the
&gt; transmission would not hold up unless modifications where made to it.
&gt; Low and behold, a few weeks later the same dooood posted that his
&gt; transmission now had a crack in it. So Bob was right again.

Well.... since you be pointing the finger at this dooood, let me tell the
whole story but in short form.

1. I plunked down $300 deposit to a now defuct listee for a BUILT up trans
that never showed up, nor did my money ever materialize.
(http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/toddhill.html )
2. City threatened with removal of my DC
3. I threw in a condition unknown, stock 74 thing transaxle and drove it
with the 2L type IV.
4. I got one year on the trans (not a few weeks) before 1st gear broke.
5. Having the city off my back, I pulled the trans and sent it down to
Rancho Performance for the proper rebuild/buildup as originally planned.
(details easily found in the archives)
6. 12K miles later, I'm still glowing and eating sliced bread every day.
:-))

gotta go jump into the DC and blast off to school.

Scott
