I just took pictures of my original mirrors on the '59 Westy, and they have 
the VW symbol, the part number, and are followed by another symbol that I 
can't quite make out.

Look at the pics at the following site:

onearth_dot_com/images/mirror.jpg

and

onearth_dot_com/images/mirsym.jpg

Hope this helps.
