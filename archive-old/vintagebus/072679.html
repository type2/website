&gt; What better to keep the dashboard dry (safari) than a splitty towel.  I
&gt; posted this because I recently came across these and my wife bought some
&gt; for the big trip that starts (kinda) on friday. 

oh thank you thank you . i saw one fo these at the campout here this weekend in a vanagon! but it
is really cool and i knew it came from rei so you just saved my the search. i am on my way !!!

and the more you use them the more they absorb. great for those leaky non safari window too!!!
