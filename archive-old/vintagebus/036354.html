Hi,listee:
   Just bought a 66 westy.  It comes without the interior lights, what-not spice rack and has one broken cabinet handle.  If anyone happen to have spare ones or know where can I find them, please let me know. Thanks.
                                                                       Michael
p.s. I am also looking for the correct side tent and roof rack for it.  
     Thanks.
