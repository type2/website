&gt;  Any way, after installing the new volt reg. the gen. light was not on so I
&gt;  took off down the highway only to have the voltage reg. fry my new 
generator
&gt;  in a matter of 5 miles.Melted all the wax (? ) off the windings.

I had a generator melt when I put an switched motors, the motor I put in had 
a gen, the one I took out had an alt.  The gen was the one that was in there 
before the alt and in the meantime I guess it had gon ebad sitting in the 
engine compartment caus eit killed my generator .  POS.
