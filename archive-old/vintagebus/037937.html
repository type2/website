I've been using latex rubber gloves (like surgeons use or like rectal
examiners use (streeeeeeeeeeetch - SNAP!) and I can get them at a pretty
good price bulk.  I can get a plastic bucket of 300 of them for $32.50 and I
really love these things - no more scrubbing my skin to a raw pulp.  The
only thing is these aren't really powdered well inside like the nice Stanley
brand are so I put in my own baby powder and it does the trick.  If I save
anyone from the pain of greasy hands and the resultant rawhide, lemme know
and I can hook you up.
