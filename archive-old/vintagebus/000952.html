Yes! You could even make &quot;better&quot; ones with newer materials and of different
sizes, such as these:

And while you're at it, how about some of those sliding curtains for the
front windows and behind the front seats :-)

&gt; Even if it wasn't a perfect repro, it's one of those things that's very
&gt; functional.  Even people with originals tents could benefit - I'd rather
&gt; put the wear and tear on a repop tent than my $1000 original!  Make it
&gt; fit the stock mounts!
