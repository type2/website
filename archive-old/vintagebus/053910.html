&gt; You folks that have order parts from Bus Depot; How long does it usually
&gt; take to have an order completed?  I ordered 11 items on or around 17 Sept
01
&gt; and as of today I've only received 3 of the items.  I had to call to get
the
&gt; magazine sent ahead.  I was told then the order should be completed in 2
&gt; weeks, well that was 3 weeks ago.  During that time the Jackpoint came in.
&gt; Is this normal?  I'm starting to think the savings isn't worth the wait.
A
&gt; month to a month and a half would have been understandable.
&gt;
