Subject: Re: steering wheel colors

Hi,

Generally, deluxes were pearl white (but not necessarily) and deliveries
were black. I have never seen any other original colors. Not sure if
interior color dictated wheel color.

Maybe someone else on the list knows.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I was told that black steering wheels belonged to commercial vans, that
&gt; sounds right. But did all Deluxes come ONLY with ivory wheels? What
&gt; about gray wheels - were they were pickups?
&gt;
&gt; How do you know what the correct color was for your bus? Should a
&gt; certain interior color dictate what color wheel you got?
&gt;
&gt; Where there any other colors? I thought I saw a cocoa color one once.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Conrad
