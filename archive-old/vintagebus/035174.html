 exactly is it...what are the symptoms, causes and cure? &gt;&gt;

Hi Kevin,
This is where the humidity of the outside air not only condenses but freezes 
from the gasolene being sprayed into the air flow into the engine.  This 
results in a build up of ice just under the carb in the top of the manifold 
and will not go away with even the most open and clear heat riser system 
because it is too far and high up from the heat riser tubing where it 
contacts the intake manifold.  This results in an engine that acts 
(Chokes/coughs.) like it is not getting enough gas when it actually needs 
more air!  For stocker 25, 36 and very early 40 HP engines this carb icing is 
just a fact of life.  For the later 40 HP engine and all other following 
(Except for the huge optional Mcode air cleaner for bus.) there is a 
preheated air supply tube from the cooling air around one of the rear 
cylinders to the air cleaner.  These later air cleaners have a flap system to 
allow this hot air to be sucked into the carb at idle to deice the upper part 
of the manifold.  When the engine is in upper RPMs above idle this flap 
closes.   The flap must be allowed to open in temp of below 70 F and the 
lower the outside temps and the higher the humidity the more important this 
is.  Avove 70 F it can be hooked open to help keep cooler air going into the 
engine.
