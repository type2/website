&gt;Is this ever gonna end. I must be in HELL there's no other explanation.
&gt;Any body experts out there that know when enough is enough ???

Only you can decide when enough is enough, but you are in that twighlight
of dimishing returns.  In fact, to fix a small ding, you may disrupt a
larger section!

I have a friend going thru this right now with a '66 convertible ghia.
It's now in filling primer, and he keeps finding &quot;surprises&quot; that a normal,
non-anal-retentive person wouldn't see.  Right now the plan is to lay on
another coat of filling primer, block it with 320, then 400, then paint.
Guess who's going to paint it :)
