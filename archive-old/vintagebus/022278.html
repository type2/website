In Texas, if they didn't come in the vehicle, you don't have to have 'em.

It's funny, we've got that seatbelt law here for cars that came with 'em,
but a lot of the Sheriff's in the smaller towns absolutely WILL NOT pull
you over for no seatbelt. They told me that &quot;they'd never get re-elected&quot;
if they did that. And my company does Risk Management for these guys!
