the o-ring may blend in to the flywheel.  you should pry the old one out
with a screwdriver.  this is a critical sealing surface.  not replacing it
may cause leaks.
YOU MUST ALWAYS HAVE 3 SHIMS FOR END PLAY ADJUSTMENT. sounds like something
is not right if you have &quot;.005&quot; and 2 shims.
240 will work, i just hope you may have put a drop of loctite on it to help.



&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; Update: The engine is out of the 71 and I saw that the front seal was
&gt; leaking. Off with the flywheel to replace but could not see any evidence
of
&gt; an &quot;o&quot; ring, or the gasket between the crank and flywheel. I put it back
&gt; together with a new front seal and no gasket the same way it came apart.
Did
&gt; I mess up?
&gt; 
&gt; The end play the way I did it was .005&quot;. This is without the gasket and
only
&gt; the two shims that were there.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I torqued to 240 per Muir, but read 253 in Bentley tonight. Is that
a
&gt; big deal?
