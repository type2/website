Subject: Re: [VB] Swing axle rear lowering kit.By WOLFGANG

Mike,
  This is a great way to get rid of heat in your bus, altho it is alot less 
expensive to put in a type 3 swing axle. Then you dont have to flip the ring 
gear. I would go down to the junk yard and pick one up some place between 
150.00 and 200.00. make shure its complete with backing plates and drums. 
Take it down to your local shop and have it checked out. Also you will have 
to lower the front to keep it even. WolfGang has the drop spindles to do that.
   
   the only down fall you may have is getting your 5 hole rims to fit the 4 
hole drums, i used a kit from Comp. Engenering  or you could find some drums 
that might match up, good luck. If you decide to get the kit you will have to 
take your tranny apart and flip the ring gear find some bug backing plates 
and drums. While still using the drop spindles for the front.

   If you want to see how my bus runs just let me know ill be happy to help 
any way i can.
