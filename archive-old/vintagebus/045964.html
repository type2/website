there are lots of 911 powered buses, most are bay windows because its 
easier.......

then there is the &quot;mystery&quot; double cab that has one in it, owner is a nice 
guy (who still has my towbar)

not a big problem to do, but 911 motor parts are expensive and setting the 
timing is a job only for the experts.......

ohh if anyone wants a mid 70s pop top Westy with a 911 motor in it let me 
know, there is one in Orange county I know of.........
