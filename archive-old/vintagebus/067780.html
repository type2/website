Hi Stan,
Some old friends of our's (Susan and Rick Crandel who now are divorced) who 
were big in the world of early westies and loved driving them with 1776 SP 
engines were always burning out PPs constantly.  Finally got Rick to try out 
the nine spring 200mm PP and all thier slipping clutch troubles went 
completely away.
