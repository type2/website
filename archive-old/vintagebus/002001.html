My stock canvas is sort of a tan color (&quot;camel&quot; is the official name I
think). Pretty neutral.  Definately not bright yellow (although custom
colors are available at a higher price). It has three zippered screens and
is quite heavy duty.  Made of a thicker material than stock, appears at
first glance to be more porous but does not leak even in very heavy rain.
Looks like it would probably last much longer than the thinner stock stuff,
in my opinion.  This is the same canvas that West Coast Metric, Rocky
Mountain Motorworks, and others sell, but for less money. (There are really
only a couple of actual poptop canvas manufacturers, resold by lots of
people. The main difference is how much they are marking it up.)  I'm not
writing from the shop right now so I can't look up the exact price, but it's
on the website; about $150 if my memory is correct.  It's made to order but
usually takes only a day to make, so delivery is pretty quick.

&gt; The original pop top canvas is hashed on my 66.  I am looking for a
&gt; replacement and have noticed many vendors.  I have seen replacements but
&gt; don't care for the bright yellow color.  Any feedback on who might carry
&gt; a more &quot;natural&quot; looking color?
