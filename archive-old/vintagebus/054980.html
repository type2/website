Thanks for the info. After making sure the backup lights were grounded =
properly; and power was going thru the fuse from the coil; it turned out =
the switch was bad. I hadn't noticed before, but one of my backup light =
housings has a factory ground spade connection attached to it. Knew the =
VW engineers had done this to later '68-'71 taillights, but didn't know =
till now that they also did this for the backup lights!
