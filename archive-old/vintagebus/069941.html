&gt; The clevis-pin hole in the plate that the pedal end of the clutch cable 
&gt; hooks to had wallowed out to within a millimeter or so of breaking through,

&gt; that to me 25 years ago).

Hi Joe,
We had the same thing happen to us and it tore through on the freeway in LA 
rush hour traffic driving to Dizzyland or MGM Studios.  Barb suddenly had to 
shift without a clutch for the first time and did well!
  Congrats on your new welding repair, it will be the first of many we are 
sure of!
