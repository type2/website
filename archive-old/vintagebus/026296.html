&gt; The tank probably isn't as

&gt; a party, invite all neighborhood kids to smooth over relationships with

&gt; with the leftover tank!

&gt; whaddaya'll think?

No offense, but I think you're crazy to trust one of those thin walled throw
away helium tanks to 100-110 psi a pressure blaster runs at.  I'd want some
substantial structure in my tank.  BTW, read the warning stamped on the
outside of that party tank.  If I remember correctly, it states something
about re-pressurizing the tank or using it for other purposes.  I'm sure its
mostly for legal liability, but like I said I wouldn't take any chances with
my health.  Its your life though.

Good luck.

Steve
