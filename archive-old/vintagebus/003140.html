&gt; &gt;&gt;Just curious. Why do you have to go to a &quot;VW&quot; shop to get body work
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Because most of the *normal* body shops either want to do collision stuff
&gt; only or think that i am dumb as hell for wanting to spend money on a
&gt; &quot;furrin&quot; car.  (I live in Michigan the last american iron stronghold.)

I understand that most body shops don't want to get into restoration work.
However, the description of the work you have to be done doesn't fall into
that category.

As far as body shops not wanting to work on &quot;furrin&quot; cars, such places are
shooting themselves in the foot. Well over half of the cars on the road
today are not Detroit made.

Check some local welding shops to get the welding done, they will be cheaper
than letting a body shop do the metal work. After the new parts are welded
on, apply a good 2 component primer to protect the work.
