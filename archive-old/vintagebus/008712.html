&gt;pulled on the pulley it kinda went thunk.  As in, moved.  But the clutch and
&gt;pressure plate were off, does that matter?  And in any case, I'll be getting
&gt;new main bearings, so would that take care of the problem?

main bearing endplay is measured with the flywheel on. Was it ?

&gt;One thing I am wondering about, in the idiot book it says when you take the
&gt;distributor drive gear out that there's a spring with it.  I saw no spring.
&gt;What's the deal?

 The spring thingy looks kinda like the one on a ball-point pen, it fits
 under the distributor, it provides tension to keep that gear
 from bouncing  around and giving uneven timing. if you lost it down in the
 case, it will be there,along with the washers from under the drive gear if
 they don't come out with it.
