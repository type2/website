I am trying to get some paint for my bus, but I think the closest Glasurit
dealer is about an hour away.

There are a few other automotive paint dealers in teh area-PPG and Sherwin
Williams.

Anyone have any experience with these paints, is Glasurit worth the drive?

I used PPG on my 65 westy, and was very pleased.  They even have colour 
mixing codes, if you bring the L number, though the Bluewhite is too green 
and needs more white than their mix.
