Subject: Compressors and Sandblasting

With father's day coming up, I'm thinking about upgrading my air
compressor. Right now I've got one of the infamous Sears Craftsmen 5hp 25
gallon oiless ones. I've already had to replace the piston and some other
parts on it which was WAYYY too expensive. And...it doesn't give me much
time during sandblasting before I have to wait on it. So...what SCFM should
I need to do blasting. I realize the bigger the better. I see a 7hp, 60
Gallon Oil-Lube that'll do 9.7 scfm _at_ 90 psi. 3 year warranty for $399.
That's at Lowe's. What do you think? Anyone spot anything better on sale
for the money?
