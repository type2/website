I'm on digest mode, so if this has already been cleared up please ignore.

From: &quot;Ted Finesman&quot; &lt;tedebare_at_one_dot_net&gt;

&gt;He's got to be kidding- thought I would send this for your information
&gt;before I tell him no. (that's being polite in my opinion) If any of you
&gt;think that this is a good idea, please let me know. Ted

WTF?  I'm baffled at this response.  I've _never_ felt like Ron was grubbing money or trying to milk the list, which is the only objection I can think of.  In fact it would be 
an honorable move if ALL the vendors who participate in this list and probably benefit from it did something similar.  For that matter, I don't even think it's up to the list 
admins if someone wants to be a collection agent for donations.  You're gonna turn money DOWN?  When donated by people who made the choice to donate it through 
a third party with no overhead?!?

Too bad Ted's response burned Ron badly enough to rescind the offer, but who can blame him?  Due to inherent laziness I haven't sent in my contribution yet, but stuff 
like this makes me wonder if I should.  Sheesh.  If I was Ron I'd consider dropping the listmember discount.  Not in retaliation, but because the list is in effect saying it 
wants no association with him.

Perhaps a word of explanation as to what was so bad about Ron's idea?  Or was this just a slip of the Send function that was supposed to have been resolved before it 
came to the list?
