Subject: Re: Side steps?  where do I look?


&gt;Which one of those bus side steps are you looking for?  The front door steps
&gt;that are just mounted there, or the ones that fold out, or the cargo step that
&gt;mounts in the jack points (Aluminuim, or the diamond plate steel ones?), or
&gt;the one that mounts under the bus and with a push of it's pedal the step pops
&gt;out from under the forward cargo door?

There is a fifth kind that came on EZ-Campers, fixed diamond plate steel
bolted to the outriggers.
