Subject: Polishing Aluminum

&lt;&lt;I am restoring a 66 Deluxe and all the aluminum
beltline trim looks all dull and crappy.  I was
thinking that I would try to polish this myself but I
have no experience in this&gt;&gt;

Don,t know if this is the correct way to go about it, but I am using the
following method with Wsety Jalousie windws with very good results. I am
using steel wool. I reorted to it because the finish was soooooo bad.
They are coming out real nice. When I paint the bus, I will pull them
again and polish em up probably with semichrome polish (in all good
motorcycle shops) and spray them with a coat of clear from a spray bomb
to prevent them from tarnishing.

The screws holding in the windows had rusted and were staining the
window. Went to the hardware staor and got a box of stainless for $3.43
that is enough to do all the windows. I was wondering if the original
screws were stainless and just rusted after fourty years of exposure. Or
was westfalia just too cheap to spend a couple bucks more per vehicle.

The other thing I noticed was the Pop rivets are rusting too. Are
stainless pop rivets available?
