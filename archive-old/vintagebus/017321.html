Subject: cylinder head temp sensors

I have a cylinder head temp guage and a sender on each side of the engine. 
The senders seem not to be working. One worked for a while and has now 
stopped too. These senders sit under the washers on my #2 amd #4 spark 
plugs. They have two wires from each to the guage. Does anyone know where I 
can get two new ones? Or maybe how these work so I can fix the two I have? 
None of my catalogs sell them. As far as I've seen anyway. Thanks

Scott
