I have actually seen a '64 with wooden rocker panels. Seems the dude
just
cut out the rust holed metal and liquid nails(ed) the wood to the body.
Used his
sander, smoothed, and painted and no one knew the better until.....

&gt;How about shooting the Rocker full of expandable foam shapeing the foam
then
&gt;plowing bondo over the mutant metal and foam (will still hold a
magnet).
&gt;Really its a beautiful thing. From my own experince you should leave as
many
&gt;surprise's for the next owner as possible.
