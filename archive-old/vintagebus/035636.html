Douglas,  Please don't take my question as a challenge.  NOT meant that way, 
I've not seen any prior postings on jetting the &quot;34&quot;.  If someone could send 
me that web site you referred to I'd appreciate it greatly.  Again, I'm sorry 
if I sounded &quot;Challenging&quot;--just trying to learn and get my 1600 running 
better.
Paul
