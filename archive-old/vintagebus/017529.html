Does anyone know of a product that works at making
that old yellowed (but in 
good condition, mind you)headliner turn white again?&gt;&gt;

Hey Andy, I'm not positive on the exact proccess, but
when I had my headliner put in by a shop, they had to
do something different about my sun visors.  Instead
of messing with the visors, they told me that they
re-dyed them instead.  They turned the original crusty
uggly vinyl visors into a pair of bright white visors
that look like new, and match the new TMI vinyl
headliner that went in.  So you may want to look into
having it dyed. Worked for me! How exactly did they
dye it back to white? I have no idea. Bleach?  Maybe
try calling up your local upolstry house and ask them
how this is done.  Hope this helps!
