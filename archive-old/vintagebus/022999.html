Folks,

As the ebay madness continues to escalate, the stakes are getting higher
and higher.  People are getting crazy money for just about anything.  This
brings me to my occasional rant:  Do your homework so you know what the
hell you're buying or selling.  And how much it should be worth.

The VW community is a very small one.  The internet is making it smaller.
As with any specialized community, everything hinges on a person's
reputation.  All it takes is one or two instances of burning or getting
burned, and *everyone* is going to know about it.  If you don't believe me,
take a peek back thru the archives for April and May.

Buyers:  do your homework before bidding on an item.  If it's listed as
NOS, ask the seller what evidence they have to support that.  I have done
this on several occasions, both at swaps and on ebay, and the replies have
been anywhere from a complete provenance of the item, to deafening silence,
and I've even been told to stick it in my ear.   Guess which auctions I bid
on?  Don't be afraid to ask questions, even though eBay's interface for
getting a person's email address is kind of a pain.  If there is any doubt,
don't bid.  Ask the list - within an hour you will have an *excellent*
assessment of the item.  Don't worry about showing your hand - Kabayo is
doing that for you :)  If you don't feel comfy doing that, try emailing one
of the more knowledgable people for Clara-fication.

It's better to let an item slip by than have your money taken.  There are
very few items that come up on ebay that won't come up again in a short
while.  If someone lists something as &quot;possibly NOS&quot;, 99 times out of 100
it's not.   If the person has the savvy to undestand what NOS is, and what
conditions an item would have to meet to be NOS, then they would KNOW if it
was NOS or not.  They're trying to work that element of doubt in their favor.

For instance, if a particular individual had asked the list about how to
tell if a case was NOS or not, and about the lack of an engine #, he would
have had at least an email from Eric&amp;Barb and Clara telling him that there
were engines without numbers, and how to check the bearing cuts.   

Go take a look at, and bookmark, the online catalogs of Wolfsburg West and
Rocky Mountain Motor Works.  You'd be surprised how much vintage stuff is
available thru them, and how much stuff is reproed that you didn't know
about.  I've learned this the hard way on too many occasions!   Why would
someone bid $500+ for a set of 36hp pistons and cylinders, when you can get
them mail-order for $299?

If you're missing a part on your bus, and that part comes up on ebay, find
a pic of an original one to make sure what you're bidding on is really for
your bus.  There's some crossover stuff out there, that is dirt cheep in
one world, and an arm and a leg in our world.

Sellers: perform due diligence to make sure what you're selling is really
what you think you're selling.  If you have doubts about the authenticity
of something you wish to sell, please ask someone.  Don't just turn an item
if you found you got burned and burn the next guy.  

If you have an item that is in less than stellar condition, don't plaster
it with rattle-can in an attempt to squeeze a few more dollars out of it.
Sure, it looks good in the pix, but when the guy gets it in his hot little
hands, the jig is up.   If you feel the need to re-paint an item, be
up-front and mention it.  By the same token, bead-blasting something does
not magically turn it into NOS.  I've seen so many pathetically
bead-blasted parts in the past few months.  Even some of the big-name
vendors from SoCal had used bits with bead scars and big price tags.  I'd
rather have a slightly crusty original piece than something thrashed up to
make it pretty.  

I've also seen gross misrepresentations of items on ebay, usually claiming
a part is barndoor when it's not, and when I've informed the seller
therewith, I either get silence, a brief &quot;thanks&quot;, or told to stick it.  I
have yet to see a seller change the auction text to reflect the information.

Knowledge is power, and money.  Do your homework.
