Was writ:
&gt;I have found a bus an hour form me, a 79 claiming to have a 1600 dp in it,
and a 4 sp,&lt;

Yes, there is a conversion kit available to put a type 1 in a type 4 bus.
There should be no changes to the transmission or engine compartment.

The bay-window transmission is held up by a hanger system that does not
&quot;dump&quot; the transmission on the ground when the engine is removed like the
early type 1 bay-window busses.  The transmission engine mounting bolt
pattern is the same and can be swapped very easily with no modification.
The sheatmetal is the limiting factor in the swapping of the type 1 to type
4 motors.

Granted the '79 bus will have taller gear ratios to make use of the 2.0L
power where the type 1 motor may struggle...  Might want to switch
transmissions to an early bay unit that was matched for a type 1 motor...
Then again someone may have already done that for you?  Check the
transmission number to tell where it may have come from.


Begin Rant&gt;
I cannot understand the fear of the type4 motor?  It is very very similar to
the type 1 except for the FI stuff (which can easily be yanked off for
carbs).  Hopefully in a few weeks I will have a 1.8 type 4 motor torn down
and ready for re-assembly to maybe go in the '66...  Still need to get the
Joe Calli book for the el-cheapo conversion....  Carbs may be an issue also,
might scavenge junkyard for the correct 34 DSCITCSSDSDRFDTG  whatever stuff
for the original carbs (complicated looking things though). 
&lt;End Rant.
