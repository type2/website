Izzy's and Creative Engineering both have the correct-looking frames.
I have a set of the CE safaris on my '60 panel, and am happy with them
so far.  The Izzy's windows look nice, but I haven't installed them
personally.  The advantage of Izzy's is that he's stateside - CE is in England.

&gt; them.
