&lt;&lt; I know of a nice,dry '54 ambulance/camper that
nobody seems to want to buy, but I'll bet everyone
would bitch like crazy if it went overseas. 

some one else said:
That bus already went overseas, whats the big deal
happening again???
-------------------------------
Um, excuse me! *that bus* came over seas from it's
European home to Arizona USA and is still for sale at
that location in extremely nice shape. What it is- is
a bitchen bus. Everyone has an opinion about it but
few opinion holders have actually seen it, driven it,
worked on it, or camped in it. I really wish that I
could afford to hang on to it. Serious negotiations
for serious potential buyers.
I have no qualms about sending it further West, Far
East or anywhere else. All potential buyers treated
equally with respect, honor and dignity.
