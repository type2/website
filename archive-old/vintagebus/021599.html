Thanks everyone for the help,
I finally found out what the problem was.
Interestingly enough was that the number 1 spark plug wire was bad and not 
hardly getting enough spark to make ignite the gas. Hence not enough power 
coming under throttle because not enough spark.
I did try taking the carb apart and checking for dirt and nothing. 
Surprisingly with the 34 pict-3 and the 009 I seem to be one of the only 
people on the road with no flat spot.
But, as John Howard has already tested the aircooled_dot_com 009 w/vacuum I will 
be ordering it soon also. Seems to me that an increase of 4-5 mpg it will pay 
itself off in soon enough time.

Thanks again and see everyone at Kelly Park
