Subject: Re: Carb Plug

This is kind of embarassing to admit but I had one of those plugs blow out
on my 74 Thing. I used a dime and some JB weld. I drove it that way for a
year before I sold the car. No cracks or anything, it held up perfect.
Hope this helps and if you find a 30/31 in a pile with a dime it may be mine.
