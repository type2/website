Subject: RE: [VB] early front turn signals

&gt;Oval bug and bus are the same, Ghia are different. I have Hella repo's in
&gt;clear and orange, I also have cheap repop's at a lot less cost.

I took the thing apart...  NO parts numbers on it at all!  Not on the
reflector, the gasket or the housing. Plastic lens reads
HELLAK2718 ~ A2286 if that helps.
