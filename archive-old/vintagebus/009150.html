&gt;, I have welded adjusters to my bug and it was
&gt; painfull , dont want to make it to my bus , is there a easierway to do it
&gt; than welding adjusters for bus-balljoint

Pain?  I did this with the '69 beam that I put on my '60 DC.  With the beam
out on the ground, it was VERY easy.  I imagine that if the beam is
installed, it would  be a PIA.  At this point, the adjusters are most likely
your best option.
