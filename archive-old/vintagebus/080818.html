Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Noise with Load

Tom,

Yup! I've considered that as well, but I can't figure out what would be
affected so dramatically by temperature. I can't decide if it's engine
related, or the tranny/rear end. I have a tentative appointment to have
the tranny overhauled, though its only got 20,000 miles on it since a
total rebuild by a trusted specialist. That's gonna cost me a ton of
money, way over 1000, but I can't see how its the engine though. Engine
seems to run great, compression all cylinders is high, FW tight, new
clutch stuff, good power, not overheating,

I changed the tranny oil 6 recently - it was among the first things I did.

&gt; One thought is that the problem is temperature related:  after driving
&gt; Otherwise: quick sanity check question: have you checked/changed your
&gt; tranny oil lately?
