I sent this earlier and it bounced back because of too much
quoting.  I've trimmed it a bit, but Jack has already responded
and the response may not make sense without my original post.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just noticed my chassis number is 216.000.001.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am I to infer that this is the first one built for the 1966 model year??
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is registered as a 1965.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Wow. What does the m-code tag say about production date...August 1, 1965
&gt; &gt; &gt; by any chance?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As a matter of fact, yes it does. Did it once belong to you??

&gt;  And jack again:

&gt; Why yes, it is my long lost bus gertrude, who was stolen from me 15
&gt; years ago! Please return her as soon as possible. I'll send out the $100
&gt; reward post haste.


&gt; Actually, it makes sense that it was made on august 1 if it is actually
&gt; the first 66 bus. VW changed model year on august 1.  I would say it is
&gt; indeed the first 1966 bus.  Congrats. Cool factor jumps way up on this
&gt; one. I have the 170,320th bus made in 1965, not nearly as cool as the
&gt; first in 1966.

Someone is pulling someone's leg here or we've all fallen victim
to another urban legend.  The August 1 date is a myth perpetrated
by VW.  I have Production Plate (M-Code tag) information on 1965
and 1966 model year buses showing the following:

1965 Model - Chassis 174,001 - June 29 - Tuesday
1965 Model - Chassis 174,370 - July 1 - Thursday

1966 Model - Chassis 000,363 - July 6 - Tuesday
1966 Model - Chassis 000,454 - July 7 - Wednesday

It may very well have been that new models were &quot;available&quot; on
August 1, but they were making them in July.

Lester, if 216.000.001 is within your reach, please pass along
the Production Plate information to us for posterity.  And, Jack,
yours was made between June 22 and June 29 probably the 23rd or
24th.  Having your Production Plate information would help too.
