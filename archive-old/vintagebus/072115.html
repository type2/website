Subject: Re: [VB] Quick VIN question

they started the 9 digit vin that tells model and year in 65, in 57 it was 
just what number bus was made.   This confuses my insurance company when I reel 
off a 6 digit VIN for my 61, but whatever.

m code plates have a date in the form of day month (year sometimes).  so 01 9 
 is the 1st of September.  In the USA they write that 9/1, but in Europe it's 
1/9.

If the bus is a 67 it should have a push button engine lid, a gas flap that 
takes no church key, and have the larger stock radio hole.     It should have 
the VIN in the engine compartment, on the M code plate behind the pass seat, 
and on the right side of the fresh air vent.  It should match all 3 places.   

Don't assume anything, but it probably is 12V.  The tranny may, or may not, 
be original.   measure yr flywheel and the bellhousing and make sure the 
correct one is larger. Check bulbs, under the pretense of cleaning contacts.

I just picked up a bus (no title) that the PO thought
was a 64.
However, upon receiving the bus, I see the VIN number
starts with &quot;227&quot;. This can only mean that the bus is
a 57,67,or 77, right? (A 67 in this case).
And assuming that the bus is indeed a 67 (the M-code
plate begins with &quot;01 9&quot; indicating it was built
January 9, 1967, correct?? So should I assume from
this code information that the tranny and all the
electricals in this bus are set up for a 12 Volt system.
