Subject: RE: [VB] 60-67, 68-72 floor matts

Yes they all have the hatch (egg crate) we were very aware of the
differences. The 1960's era (early) was copied from an NOS mat that I have
(going to Robert Davis) that came with my late 59 single cab I once owned.
It isn't even cut to go around the steering column, actually there are no
slits in it, but does have the OG VW partnumber and markings.

I will let people with late model buses deal with the high beam switch hole
and the bigger hole for the e-brake boot (what's that?)

&gt;     I just got the word and I will have the samples this weekend for NEW 
&gt; BUS
&gt;  FLOORMATS.
&gt;     I will have late 59 (forward shifter) to 67 floormats and also 1968 to
&gt;  1973 floormats.
&gt;     The samples will available for Viewing at Jerome and the container is
&gt;  going to arrive at the end of September.
&gt;     All the molds for the mats were made off of NOS parts that I supplied
to
&gt;  the manufaturer and are EXACT copies of the originals. For all you Bay
bus
&gt;  owners this should make you happy as these mats haven't been avaiable for
&gt;  years!
&gt;  
er- Ronnie, there were three different shape floor mats used from ch 501 xxx

(forward shifter) through 67,

the earlier kind has a slit for the ebrake handle, which used a metal cover 
for the ebrake cable ends, not the rubber ugly boot thing

then they went to the oval hole, when they introduced the ugly rubber boot 
(1962 model year?)

then they stuck the high beam on the turn sig switch, rather than the floor.

but it is great you are getting nice repros.  These have the hatch pattern 
underneath?
