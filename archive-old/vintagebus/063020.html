Subject: Technical Service Bulletin

I was just cruising aut*z*ne_dot_com and saw they actually had some neat stuff
on their site. you can enter which vehicles you have then search for parts
and get technical specs on your specific vehicle(ie timing, dwell,
gap...maybe more that is all i looked at first)

Anyway they have this section called technical service bulletins-which they
say are bulletins published by the manufacturer that supersede the service
manuals. They listed two for my '65 bus:

Electrical Contact Enhancer   979404   dated 11/01/94
Avoiding Unnecessary Battery replacement    279310    dated 7/15/93

has anyone heard of these things? or have any ideas how to get the service
bulletins.
