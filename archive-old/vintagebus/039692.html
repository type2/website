Okay... I have seen the ads and read a little about the full circle cranks 
(as in Berg).  However, what does the list think of these in terms of real 
world experience versus the use of the std counter balanced ones?  Is the 
Full Circle truly an improvement for a daily driver vehicle in terms of 
longevity and smooth running or is it strictly a wahoo performance item and 
to be avoided?  My son (Christian the new list member) and I have been 
discussing this for our bus engines and would be interested in other 
thoughts.  We are not out to build a quarter mile burner but want to balance 
power and longevity in an 1835 with a single carb.

Keep it clean troops.
