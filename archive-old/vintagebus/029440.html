Subject: keeping track...

Late last night I was reading some posts on the list, and some replies
from listees and I got to thinking....  As I look at some of the more
*mature* bus owners, it seems they have hundreds of incredible stories
to tell.  Every once in a while, while I'm visiting with a buser here in
town (owned his 62 bus since 66) he will bring out this little scrap
book he has made up over the years.  Its wonderful to see these
pictures, and hear the stories that go along with them.  Many of them, I
wish I could have lived myself.  But hey...thats not possible...as he
bought his bus 17 years before I even came into existence.  I've always
liked hearing stories from the past, history....if you will.  So, upon
suggestion from a listee, I went out and bought myself a little
journal-sized notebook.  This I will take along with me to campouts, and
on trips mostly...but I may even include other significant
events....with my bus(es) mainly.  I'll also have a little maintenance
list in the front of it...  I plan to include things like who I meet,
some stories they tell, mileage, where I went, what roads I took, photos
if possible, if anything went wrong on the trip....things of this
nature.  I think that I'll enjoy reading my &quot;scrap book&quot; in 20-30 or
more years, even more than I enjoy reading others'.  These old
Volkswagens put us in some interesting situations....and I'd like to
have a little more than a thought to remember them by.  Hey, maybe some
17 year old kid would love to hear these stories when i reach my *prime*
;-)

Just thought I'd share...

Now, I'm off to wrench on 3 buses today... my 62 (fitting my custom carb
spacer...another post) and my friend's 58 (sealing up a redux box in
trade for some parts) and a 69 (generator replacement in trade for some
parts)....

life is good.... take it easy boys and girls.
