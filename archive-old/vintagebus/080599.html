Subject: ...Engine Question...

Hey everybody,

My friend is in the middle of aquiring a '69 bus With no engine... We just 
saw a '62 beetle engine for sale in the paper and was wondering:

-Could we drop it in the bus with no major modifications?

I've gotten mixed responses by asking my friends, but I though for the most 
part it would be no problem....

Engine specs:

1200cc 40 hp engine
6 volt generator
36Hp type fan shroud

thanks again guys!

-Aaron
