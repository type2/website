Subject: repop safaris

well,

thought i'd add my $0.02 on this...

I think that since safari's arent really to ideal for rain i'll probably
skip em as it rains here a lot.  If neither one seals out the water well,
then i'd say its a wash wether one buys originals or not.  (i know some
say the originals leak less, but less doesnt cut it in MHO... it either
leaks or doesnt.)

Now, i KNOW there must be some way to seal em up well... i mean all kinds
of cars and boats have windows that seal perfectly fine, why should a bus
windshield be any different?  It is possible to seal a window that opens
and closes, its just that nobody has figured out how to do it on a
safari... _yet_!

Maybe i'll try different seals from other brands of car (everywhere ed
o'donnell used a golf door seal on his safari, yes just one, on his mutant
bus.)

Perhaps their is a marine weatherstrip they use on hatches that would be
ideal...

there has to be some way to get em to work right... repop or original.

hmm, maybe i'll buy a set just so i can figure out how to make em not
leak, heh. If anyone wants to donate some, i promise to research like
crazy. ;)

peas,

Steve
