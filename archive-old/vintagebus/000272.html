Subject: [VB] POPOUT frames NEEDED
Message-ID: &lt;0.60abb2c3.2557818e_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Help!
I need a few NICE rust free popout frames.
Glass not important. 
I can take them apart myself.
Also need a passenger side vent wing frame and a drivers side vent ving scoop.
These are for my 1957 frankenstein bus.
Any help and/or leads apreciated.
Regards, Greg
