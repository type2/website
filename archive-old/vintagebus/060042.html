Subject: Re: [VB] Cracked tranny fix????

JB Weld will probably fix the leak but, if the crack is in a critical section (like where the
carrier bearing for the differential mounts), he could damage other internal parts in the
transmission by continuing to drive it.

If it was mine I would go ahead and repair it now.

Today he woke up to a
puddle of gl4. There is a hairline crack on the center section. Does
anybody here know of a way to patch the crack?
