In a message dated 98-08-19 01:03:32 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt;  All the other cylinders have what look like remnants of the same
 thing, but the #4 has full webbing.  I seem to recall reading somewhere (the
 sermons?, damn can't go there) that this web should be removed, is this the
 case? 
 Which leads me to my next question.  On the case, there is no identifying
 number under the generator tower, instead there is a stamping on the top of
 the case next to the split.  The stamping is next to a VW trademark with the
 number T0150810.  What kind of case is this and should I be worried about
 poor quality? &gt;&gt;
Hi Terry &amp; Sunshine,
We use a screwdriver and hammer to punch out the flashing on the cylinders.
Also you should check your heads for the same.  We just bought 4 new heads
from brazil and they all had alot of flash in the front, rear and down the
center.  For the front and rear ends we used a circular saw with a used
carbide blade for wood to clean out the flash there, took about 2 minutes for
each head.  Then files and drill bits to rid the flash in the center passage.
As for your case it sounds like it was a type 3 engine in it's previous life.
If you are not looking to drag race with this engine and it is used German and
in good condition as is it should work well.    Eric &amp; Barb
