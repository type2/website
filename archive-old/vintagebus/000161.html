&lt;&lt; wondering how you guys would get rid of and prevent the light surface rust 
that has attacked the frame and the  springs. This would be a PITA to hand 
sand off!
 Would you  recommend sandblasting? acid dip? POR-15? &gt;&gt;
Hi Pete,
You might want to look in your area for a zinc plating shop.  They charge by 
the wieght, and you might want to have other things done at the same time to 
help reach thier minimuim wieght requirement.  To plate the steel they first 
have to acid dip the parts so this will both take care of the rust, and 
prevent any in the future.

&lt;&lt;Would you reccomend getting it professionally  installed by an 
auto-upholstery guy, or Do it myself?&gt;&gt;
If the upholstery is properly made, you can install it.  Especially if you 
take off the old material you should take notes to install the new by.
