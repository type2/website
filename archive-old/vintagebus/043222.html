A long long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, 'they' (VW dealers, FLAPS)
used to sell a hard-rubber imitation 'end-of-tranny-shaft' specifically
for alignment of the disk when installing the pressure plate. I have had
one for 25 years.  Guess times have changed.  Mine stays in the tool box,
wrapped in cellophane til needed.
