get an engineering firm to modify my reduction boxes by milling the case and
replacing the gears with 2 the same size give a 1:1 redux box W/O any height
loss etc.

==================================================

the answer! anything is possible if you've got money, picked up a street
rodder magazine lately??

lets see you'd need a design engineer or at the very least a tooling
engineers capability for 8-16  hours, but could easily go 40hrs at 200
dollars an hours or at least what I charge,  4 - 6 hours programming a CNC
Mill at 80 bucks and hours then probably less than 16 hours for actual
machine work at 65 an hour, assuming we could use prefab (off the shelf
gears) ok what be the total if my shop quoted it? $3120 minimum estimate for
the first one could easily be as high as $9520 if we'd have to design a
custom gear set-up , much cheaper for the 2nd and third, I could be wrong
and this could be a bolt on conversion after a little work with your angle
grinder, i doubt it! my advice is to quit worrying about it and just get
used to driving slow, or sell your bus and buy a Toyota, or better yet give
Todd hill 900 bucks and have him build you a transmission.
