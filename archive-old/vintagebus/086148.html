Subject: Looking for Gordon Ray in North Carolina

David Cook is looking for help.

 From David Cook

I'm sure most of you will remember back at the
beginning of December I helped a guy who had contacted
me through the AIRS list.  He was driving a '67 bus he
had purchased somewhere in Colorado back to North
Carolina but broke down near Manhattan, KS.

To catch you up:

After a weekend of work, we thought he was back on his
way, however he broke down again 30 minutes down the
road.

He decided he did not have enough time off from work
to delay getting back to North Carolina.  So, I took
him to a car rental place and he rented a car and
drove home.  The bus was left at the rest area on the
highway, and I towed it back to my place in Manhattan
the next day.

At that point, the plan was that I'd repair the bus
and drive it to him sometime this spring.

A couple days later, he called me and said he had
talked to the guys he purchased the bus from in
Colorado.  They had told him that they needed to get
to NC for a wedding.  The new plan was that they were
going to come out here, put a new engine in the and
drive it to him.  They were supposed to contact me to
arrange this, but I haven't heard anything from them
either.

The last time I heard from his was the first week of
December.  His bus has sat in my driveway since then.

I lost his phone number.  I thought I had it saved in
a voicemail on my phone, but I guess it simply was
automatically deleted at some point.

I do have his address, however a search of
whitepages_dot_com reveals no Gordon Ray.  Tonight I
called all the Ray listings (hoping to find a
relative) and everyone I talked to had no idea who he
was.  (I did leave 3 answering machine messages, we'll
see what happens.)

I sent a card to the address he gave me two to three
weeks ago explaning that I hadn't heard from him and
that I didn't have his number.  Of course I gave my
address and number.  I have heard nothing from him by
this.

So, what I'm hoping for is to find someone who might
know who Gordon is and how to get ahold of him.  I'm
kind of hoping that the guys in Colorado still have a
number and someone knows them or they will see this
message.

I'm going to post this in a couple of the forums on
thesamba_dot_com, the Buskatiers list, and the Common Gear
yahoogroup but if you are a member of another
aircooled VW list, I'd appreciate if you'd forward it
along.

Thanks,

David Cook
