Hi Glynn,
Go with the 1965 unit.  Replacing the hockey stick is easy.  Hopefully it has 
the later 4.125 R&amp;P, and 24% reduction boxes.  Instead of the 1960-63 4.375 
R&amp;P, and 28% reduction boxes.  Though before installing the 1965 tranny you 
really should install a late 1964-67 front suspension to keep the braking 
bias correct to prevent doing spins down the road when the pavement is slick 
while panic stopping.  Plus installing the later braking system will increase 
your stopping power by about 20%, and it will feel more like 50%.   Eric&amp;Barb
