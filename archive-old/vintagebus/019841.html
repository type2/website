This is a common problem - people underestimate the weight of
the frames and glass assemblies.  On my '60 DD I did the *exact* 
same thing, and I *knew* better!  Anyway, you can okie adjust
'em by lifting them up hard and (ahem) adjusting.  There's a lot
of pliability in the hinge and connection area.    It's for
this exact reason that I'm doing all the nose work on the barndoor
with the windows installed.

YMMV - no warranty express or implied!

&gt; 
&gt; My question is: The doors seem to be sagging a bit in the rear - 
&gt; which of course I didn't notice before the bus was painted. I was 
&gt; considering installing a washer or two on the inside of the lower 
&gt; door hinge, in hopes of regaining the proper alignment for the door. 
&gt; Anybody done this?  Will it work?  Better ideas?
