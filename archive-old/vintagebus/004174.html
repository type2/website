Hi,

Our 1967 dexluxe came from the factory with all the seatbelt mounting points
. The bolt holes in the cargo are still have the original plastic plugs in
them. The fromt had belts installed, I presume, at the dealership as that
was the minimun requirment at the time. The belts are a coppery bronzey
cooler that matches  the &quot;platimum mesh&quot; interior.

I have a more or less complete set of belts for our dearly departed 1969 bus
that I want to use for now. Since the 1967 bus did not come with the bolts I
attempted to use the bolts from the 1969 bus and also some form the 1972
bus. They seem really tight. In fact in the range of holes for the middle
seat. the bolt hole all the way on the drivers side will not accept a bolt
at all but it does have threads.

Now to the point. What size are the bolts supposed to be?. I suspect that
holes (nuts welded on the underside)   are just cruddy from years of
non-use. I could clean them with a tap but I dont want to bugger them up by
guessing at the wrong size.

PS The cargo floor mat had perfed areas that could be cut out for the
seatbelts to emerge from. These were unmolested when I got the bus.Seat
belts must not have been a concern for the POs.

PSS when I was a very small child, Our family had a 1963 Kombi. Dad often
had the middle sear out. My brother sister and I often road around in the
bus seated at a kids size picnic table that Dad put in. I wonder what the
jail time would be for trying to get away with that today :) I now have my
own kids and have to resist the urge to let them wonder around the bus while
we are under way.
