hey all
the 63 I got not too long ago was made March 5 I believe...4 or 5 days
after they started pressing the engine vents outward instead of inward.
It has a small nut trans.  Should it have 15&quot; rims?
the small nut trans's from 55 on should have 15&quot; rims right?
I have 3 - 15&quot; rims...I just need one more.

I was thinking about *trying* to find some 16&quot; rims and then putting
lower profile tires on for a bit better handling along with a sway away
bar and a camber compensator....
but trying to find &quot;spare&quot; barndoor rims could really be more of a
hassle than its worth.

I thought they changed everything (rear hatch, rims, trans, door handles
etc) for the 64's.

Isaiah
-71 weekender - Stella - just got an oil change
-63 standard - with 10 or so 14&quot; rims..but only 3 - 15&quot;ers
