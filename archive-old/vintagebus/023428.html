Interesting discussion from the VintageVW list.  Thought the engine volks
might like the info.

Anyone ever seen this special oil screen sump he has?  I presume this would
be good

Someone want to send this along to Hoover for comment? I think this is a
great set of photos and discussion point.  Not to tear the guy down
unnecessarily, I appreciate he took the time to share what he knows...

&gt; Here's another neat page showing a VW engine in an aircraft.  This time
&gt; with URL.
&gt;

    i wish i had that airplane!  :-)  but i sure wouldn't want to be flying
with an engine built like he did...

    his mistakes included lapping the jugs into the heads, putting a filter
on the suction side of the oil pump, use of assembly lube, and not honing
the jugs with a proper cylinder hone. the reason he had wear on the valve
stems was because someone didn't grind the keepers slightly so they locked
on the valve.

    the latter problem is understandable, since it's factory procedure to
let the valves rotate in the keepers. however, gene berg has found that the
stems last far longer if the keepers are locked. in fact, clyde told me that
every single head that leaves the shop, stock or hi-po, has locked keepers.
there has been no problem with valve life because of this change, so it's a
recommended procedure for all type 1 vw engines.
