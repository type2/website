Subject: Reduction Box Bolt Question

While Sunshine's reduction box is at the machine shop getting the easy out
EDM'ed out and inserts put in, I decided to check the other side to make
sure all was well.  All the bolts came out without breaking, even though the
front one needed to be reversed a little at the end of each turn to keep it
from chattering.

I then ran a tap into the holes and threaded the new bolts in.  Since I was
doing one at a time, I didn't have to deal with the spring plate and it sure
was wonderful being able to thread those bolts in by hand.  The new bolts
are about 1/4&quot; longer than the old ones, but after running in the tap to
clear the rust at the bottom of the hole, the longer bolts had no problem
bottoming out.

Now the question, I believe I remember someone (Clara?) saying to grease the
bolts when I put them in.  I was wondering what the preferred grease is.  I
am planning on using the silver anti-sieze stuff unless someone recommends
otherwise.

I thank you and Sunshine the '64 Westy thanks you,
terry
