&gt; This may seem like a weird question, but I have no
&gt; point of reference and I
&gt; need your help.
&gt; 
&gt; I went to the gas station to fill up the bus after
&gt; driving it around town
&gt; for the past 2 weeks to work (a 5 mile comute).   It
&gt; took 8 gallons to go
&gt; just under 200 miles; that would be around 25MPG. 
&gt; Is that good, bad or
&gt; sorta OK.  I have a 1500cc single port engine that I
&gt; just rebuilt (the first
&gt; tank of gas to go thru the new engine

Thats pretty good if ya ask me.... it ought to start
gettin better after a while after the engine is thru
its breakin period... 

(I suspect the fuel mixture is a bit rich
&gt; but haven't had time to
&gt; make that adjustment yet).

Only way to check fersure is an analyzer.... But its
always better to be to rich than to be to lean. Ive
got a new carb on the B*g, well 6 months old.... seems
I had to adjust it 4 or 5 time... not because it was
set wrong, but because IT was breakin in to (?)
Any similar experiences with a carb acting like it was
&quot;breakin in&quot;?
