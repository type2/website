Subject: looking for 48's or 44's for my type 4 motor

well figured it couldn't hurt to ask but I am building a 2.5 liter type
4 motor for my 66 single cab and am looking for some carbs. A set of 48
dells with type 4 manifolds and linkage would be my first choice then a
set of 48 IDA Webbers would be my next choice. 44's would be as small as
I would want to go on this project. Anyway anyone have a nice used setup
they want to pawn off? I will be at Puyallup this weekend if you want to
arrange to meet.
Additionally anyone put an upright type 4 in a truck before? It looks
like the 911 fan shroud is going to be maybe 1/3 inch two tall.  
Thanks
Shawn
