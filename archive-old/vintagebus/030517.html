Well, you are certainly talking about a niche market.  The very generic and
American slanted motor shows like Hot Rod TV, Horsepower TV, Shade tree
mechanic (which is Crank and Chrome now),  My Classic Car, and one other very
poorly produced restoration show on Speed Vision are about all you have now.
I'm not sure you'd get enough money to produce a series from just bodywork
advertisers.  Your looking at about 5k to 7K a show, and I'd bet that the
network (which ever one that might be) would want at least 7 shows to start
with.

Nice idea though.  I love to shoot it if someone wants to put up the money.

&gt; Hey Kelly,

&gt; If this were a perfect world I would have you doing a TV show for PBS kind
&gt; of like Norm Abram's &quot;New Yankee Workshop&quot;. Or that lame-o Steve Thomas'
&gt; &quot;This Old House.&quot; It would be really cool to look in on Saturday afternoon
&gt; and watch as you fabricate and install replacement parts for an old bus
&gt; cargo floor, or that job you recently did replacing the entire nose. Each TV
&gt; season you could do an entire bus project start to finish. I'm sure we'd
&gt; have bus owners lined up around the block to have their projects chosen. And
&gt; like &quot;This Old House&quot; the aftermarket suppliers could chip in with parts and
&gt; advice to get their names in front of the show's viewers.
&gt; I don't suppose there's enough of an audience to make this interesting to a
&gt; PBS producer but I'd watch faithfully.
