Hey all,

    This last weekend I spent a few hours parting ut a 67 Deluxe I had
found... It was mighty ROUGH... Well I got a hold of the owner and he
said I could have the g-damn thing if I wanted it. It was o his property
and the people who lived there before picked and left.... He said the
place had been sittig empty for a couple of years and he wanted to clear
the place out... So I offered him some money for some parts but he said
I could have what I wanted. It would be less &quot;junk&quot; for him to haul
away.. So Itook him up on the offer and went hunting.. The bus must of
had a tree decide to fall on it at some point becase the roof was
smashed up big time.. Bt inside were parts o'pleanty.. I scored a set of
front doors with glass in rel good shape and another set of front door
glass assy. These are the ones I'm curious about. One of them has a
bracket on the outside towards the top I'm guessing for a mirror and the
other one just has holes where the bracket used to be... Theseare
different from the ones on my 60 and unlike the others I've noticed.. Is
here anything special about these... They still have the Sekurit glass
and just need cleaned up.. I plan on using one of the sets for my bus as
mine are cracked and not looking too good.... I was just wondering what
they came off of. All in all it was a pretty good score. I got a
american spec bumper and a set of pop-outs and all kinds of little
stuff. Not tooo bad for a total investment of 0 dollars...Well thanks in
advance for the info.

Shawn
