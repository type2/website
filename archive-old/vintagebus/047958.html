Hi Steve,
Good list of procedures for double clutching, but here is some fleshing out 
of them.

&lt;&lt; 1. Clutch in
 2. shift into neutral
 3. clutch out
 4. tap accelerator&gt;&gt;
#4 is only quickly done to throw the input shaft and it's gears on it up 
above the RPMs of the pinion shaft that is always connected to the rear 
wheels rolling on the road while the VW is in motion.  Then while you do 
procedures #4 &amp; 5 the input shaft will start to drop in RPMs and hopefully 
you engage the gears at close enough RPMs to prevent clattering or grinding 
the syncos or gears.  This causes less strain and stress on the syncos and in 
non-syncro trannies is essential for all down shifting.

&lt;&lt; 5. clutch in
 6. shift into desired gear  &gt;&gt;
These two moves are done rather quickly when downshifting.  Take too long and 
the input shaft looses all too much momentum of RPMs to match the pinion 
shaft.  On the other hand RPM the inputshaft way up too high of RPM and shift 
in to quickly will result in clattering or grinding of the syncros and/or 
gears. 

If you are running a non-syncro, damaged syncro tranny or perhaps even a good 
condition tranny in cold weather and are up shifting it is a good idea to 
wait a second with the clutch pedal depressed.  This allows the input shaft 
to slow down enough to match the pinion low RPMs before shifting into the 
next gear up.

These two double clutching methods are needed when the clutch cable fails 
suddenly.  It is wise for the VW novice to practice shifting without a clutch 
before it is ever needed.  Check out the Idiot's Manual for more info on this 
procedure.
  
Barb had to suddenly shift without a clutch cable in LA during rush hour 
traffic on our way to the MGM studios when the pin hole in bracket that hold 
the forward end of the clutch cable wore through.  She had practiced just a 
few minutes years before and because of this was able to keep us from getting 
stalled on an area of very busy roadway that we had little chance of getting 
to the shoulder to switch seats so I could take over.    Eric&amp;Barb
