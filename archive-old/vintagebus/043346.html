&gt;I'm looking for some good ideas that are quick, simple, cosmetically
&gt;appealing, and undamanging to the engine tin.  I have the hot air intake,
&gt;heater duct, and heat riser holes that I need to plug in my rear tin.

You can get a hole plug at the hardware store which is basically a
rubber donut, two steel washers, and a bolt through the works.  As you
tighten the bolt, the rubber squeezes out and makes the seal.  If you
can get one big enough, the rubber should seal against the tin edge
without messing the finish...a spray of black hi-temp paint on the
steel washers beforehand might even make it look nice.

Other idea...get various sizes of foam drink cups, cut off the bottoms,
and shove the cut-off bottoms into the holes.  These may not hold as
well, but it's cheap to try.  You might paint them, but some kinds of
paint &quot;eat&quot; foam.

How about a cork or rubber stopper?

There is a company called Caplugs (www_dot_caplugs_dot_com) that makes plastic
plugs in a variety of sizes and materials.  Many older GM products have
them to seal up sheet metal holes (like the hole in the door on the
Ch_at_vy where the window wiring harness would go in an _at_lds).  Their
Web site offers free samples of sizes you select.  I've never dealt
with them; I just know they exist.

Good luck!
