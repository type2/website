&gt; Hoping someone could identify this beast for me. I've been sitting on this 
&gt; for a while and have decided to get rid of it. If you've seen these sell or 
&gt; just have an opinion, I would appreciate an Idea of how much to ask for this 
&gt; thing. last run in 94 when po's got too old to use it. also if you have any 
&gt; idea what company(s?) was doing this to buses that would be great to know 
&gt; too.
