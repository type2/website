Subject: My Teen soon to be Bus Driver

I've been holding this from the list till Friday, so...
Thought I'd fill in the bus list on the drivers training lessons going on.
My 15yr old daughter is as anxious as a cat on a hot plate to get her license.
Wants to spend her 16th birthday at the DMV.  So... its drivers training in the
'60 double cab.  Since she can't get her permit until Jan., she has to be
content with shifting gears as we drive around town.  At first it was VCAS
(voice command auto shift), but not she has it down where she pays attention to
traffic flow, sound of the engine and the clutch and is making shifts right on
time.  Caught her a couple times looking out the window and we both had a good
laugh.  &quot;woops, I was supposed to shift there, wasn't I&quot;.  Reinforces the need
to stay focused.  We'll be hitting the parking lots next and that should be some
fun.   If she ends up spending most of her driving in the DC the next 6+ months,
we figure that she'll use it for the driving test.  Can't wait to see the look
on the examiner's face as she pulls up to the testing lane in the DC.

Anybody learn how to drive in a bus?

Scott
