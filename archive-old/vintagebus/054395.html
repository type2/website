Subject: Re:  camshaft selection

&gt;&gt;Also what is the best timing offset?  They seem to 
come in +2, +1, 0, -1, and -2 formats.  I am thinking
that 0 is the best choice  or would something more
aggressive be better like +2?

I thought that had to do with cam bearings and the
size of the cam.  Seems like Muir addressed this...
