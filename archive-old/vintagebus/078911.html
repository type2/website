Subject: Door window frames painted

So .... I pulled out my windows out of my doors and sandblasted the frames and
primed em with epoxy primer - and because I wanted primer in all of the groves
etc.. I had runs like a ... well - lots of runs.  So I sanded em down and
primed again and painted, and because I wanted paint in all of the little
groves etc.. I had runs like a ... well - lots more runs .. so sanded em out
and painted and sanded out more runs and finally today I painted two last
light coats - I only noticed one small run and I'm gonna leave it.  Now its
time to put em back together.  Anyone know of any sort of procedure for doing
this?  I'm replacing my old glass with newer glass because - a) the old glass
was pretty bad with bubbles and cracks and stuff and b) they really didn't
slide all that well (I think I had the wrong window felt) and c) the latches
were broken.  I think I'm replacing sigla with sekruit?

Anyway - these frames look nice and I want to put them together in the best
possible way so I don't scratch em up etc.. I'd like to find some sort of
procedure for doing it.

Also - what size screws do I need for screwing the little bendy piece that
holds the latch thingy to the window frame?  Is it possible to get stainless
steel screws?

Also - what size screws do I need for putting my pop-outs together - I think
there are 4 per pop-out?

Also - what size screws do I need for putting the pop-outs back on to the
hinge thing on the window?

TIA
