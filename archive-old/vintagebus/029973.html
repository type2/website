Subject: thick oil?  F*rd...
References: &lt;37.d1a7904.2752d9dd_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Well... for what its worth... I have been running 20W-50 in my 71 (1600SP) up
until about 4 days ago when I changed it to 10W40.  I run thicker oil as my rings
are going...and my oil pressure isn't the greatest I'd imagine... I've started it
with 20W-50 in it in 10 degree weather and haven't had a problem...but I let it
warm up for a good 5-10 minutes before I take off in the morning.  While I was up
in northern WI hunting this last week... I was at my uncles (whos shop I used --
heated! woo hoo!!) and did a lot of work on the bus.  I had to go a ways to get
some parts... plus we had to go another 30 miles to get a part for one of his
F*rd trucks....anyways... I picked up some more oil then...and I saw a bottle of
&quot;76&quot; oil...you remember...the big orange ball with the 76 in it?  I've a few of
their stocking hats...pens...oil now...and some other bits...I've been trying to
find a 76 station for a while now to pick up some more antenna balls...but they
are nowhere to be found around here anymore. :-(
So anyways.... I guess what I'm trying to say is that some engines can run thick
oil all year round...some can't... really depends on a lot of different
things.... most of which I haven't had to deal with *yet*.

by the way... is anyone into old Ford Econoline trucks/vans??  I'm looking at
buying a '65 truck...and will need a passengers side king pin and eventually a
tailgate (this tail gate is rusty) for it...  if anyone could lead me to some
good places on the net...or share some stories/experiences/tech with me...that'd
be great!

&gt; is this the general consensus of the list? I often wonder lately what of the
&gt; modern oils is the most appropriate. I dont expect every one to agree, just
&gt; want to get a general feeling.
