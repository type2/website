Hi Jerry,
Another VW friend has died. Please read the whole set of correspondences.
The last one explains the death.
Tom Laney was so supportive of me when Bill died. He'd heard about it all
from your network.
Am doing better...planning on going to BBB in the Vanagon. Put Melvan up for
sale in n/l only till March then will put on Samba if not sold.
Hope all's well with you both.
Janet

Oh Jo,

I know what you're going through...I felt that way the first month and more.
Now I'm feeling better about things...The girls and I scattered Bills ashes
in Evergreen at our old house where we raised our family. It lifted a veil
for me and I'm feeling like I can think clearer (tho' that's not necessarily
true either!!!) But I have made the decision to seek legal counsel to find
out if negligence was involved in Bill's treatment.
I can't believe he was driving the baja. He'd just won a trophy for it at
D&amp;D's. I'm selling Bill's cars and parts also. The 4 car garage he's waited
for all his life will be practically empty by the time things are gone.
I feel so bad for you...such life changes...are you sure you want to come
out here when your support system is there? Altho' starting over here may be
good for you. The job market here is the pits if you're white, female,
educated, unless you speak Spanish. This is what my friends say. What do you
do?
Have my sister coming from Florida for the weekend, so better start
cleaning...
Keep me informed. When you come to LC, please call me and we'll get
together. Planning on going to Lake Havasu for Buses by the Bridge on Jan 11
and getting back about the 21.
Take care...my thoughts, prayers, and meditations center on you right now.
I'm sending this whole correspondence to Jerry Jess so you may get more
emails from VW folks who have been so supportive of me. Take care beautiful
lady...you're heart may never be filled in the same way as with Tom, but you
will get feeling back.
Love...hugs, etc...
Janet

  Hi Girl,

  I started this letter days ago, when it first came in, and I seemed not to
be able to finish it...I kept saving it as a Draft...but tonight will be it!

  What I wrote before:
  Services were Friday. (that was the 26th I think)... His boys and I went
to Las cruces on Sat Morning.  They worked to take things they wanted out of
his two storage units for 2 1/2 days.   Tommy, who lives in boulder took the
BSA and Triumph and 4 VW motors and generator and more things like that. He
rented a 14' UHaul.  Adam, who lives in Houston, drove the '61 Ford Pickup,
put the BMW motorcycle on the pickup, and then rented a good size UHaul and
took the pinball machine, Hot Wheels cars, tool boxes and I forget what all
else....

  They left at 3 pm on Wed (the Wed. after the services).  I didn't have it
in me to leave and drive that day.  I left Thurs Morning...but couldn't make
it all the way...I got so tired about 7 PM and stopped.  The next day I went
to the crash site and also took pictures of the car ('64 beetle baja).  It
was horrific.  But, I clearly understand that Tom is not coming home, which
I believe I still was waiting for...except he can come by spirit...and I
have asked him to do that.

  Today:

  Here it is today...I think it is the 8th.  I am working 3/4 days...but
have no heart for it and am struggling with it...need to finish something up
tonight and running out of steam.

  I cannot get it into my mind that I can't talk to Tom and have him talk
back...that I will not get to see him again.  I have felt his spirit but he
doesn't seem to get to stay.  And I feel empty when I feel his spirit has
moved on somewhere.  I mean, what do spirits do that keep them so busy that
they can't stay???

  This is way too long term.  And my mind moves from thought to thought,
many of which I don't want to have. Those are filled with guilt and
unhappiness with me and the world and people that I have been hurt by...gosh
this is horrible!  Night is, as with others, the worse.

  I am having to move because we had just sold the house and that was why
Tom was coming to spend a week...he was going to get his cars started and
moved and even sold...I have no heart to pack and move, but closing is Dec.
31.  I guess I need to sell the VW Splitty and the VW Mini-T and yet I seem
to have no energy to do that...maybe tomorrow!

  I have rented Tom's apt. for another Month and I will rent it for January
as well...I think I will come in January and stay a couple of weeks...look
around NM for where I might want to come and live...I will be leaving a
large support system here, but I don't want to live here...I was suppose to
move to NM when the house closed...I think it is a plan that I need to go
forth with...

  I will, after getting settled, move mom...but I will miss my son...I'll be
so far away!!  He lives about 2 1/2 hours from me now and we see each other
several times a month...

  Actually I feel very lost...Tom and I had several plans of action all of
which were going to be enjoyable together...

  I hate this and just want Tom to come home...

  And with that, how are you doing?

  Hugs, Jo

    Oh my God Jo...
    I just got home from a T-day visit to my family in Colorado...Oh my
God...I can't believe this...
    I don't know where you are now...in TX or NM. Please call me if you are
here or anywhere and we'll talk...505-527-5605.
    Oh my God...I can't stop saying that. Needless to say my heart goes out
to you...Whatever I can do for you let me know. His words were so wonderful
for me when Bill died. Obviously I know what you're going through and you
should be greatful that he died without suffering. I feel so bad for
you...but you'll get better in time...awful to say so soon, but it it has
worked for me.
    Please contact me soon. If you in town I can meet you on Sunday...I'm at
Farmers Market tomorrow and then I have errands but could meet you in the
evening or late afternoon...leave a message on the machine.
    Oh, Jo...My thoughts and prayers will be with you till we talk.
    Janet

      Hello Janet,

      My Tom was killed yesterday on his way here for Thanksgiving from Las
Cruces.  A 17 year old in a jeep veered into his lane and hit him head on.
I was told he died immediately.  I learned of this last night at 11:30 pm,
but he died at 6 pm.  I can't think...I had something else I was going to
say...   Oh, I had just put the house in contract and he was coming to help
get things ready for me to go to New Mexico.

      This is soooooo wrong...we had been through so much...we were doing so
well with a future and had come to a level of acceptance and understanding
with each other...God I loved him...and I just want him to come home.

      Jo
