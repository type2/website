&gt;Ebay stuff is a Friday topic, thanks.

I thought it was legit to ask about a possible purchase item? But that we
weren't going to post every little nut and bolt that we find...this list IS
pro-information, no?

So, let me ask a different, possibly unrelated question. Does anyone know
anything about a 52 bus in Montclair, CA that's for sale? I've only seen
one picture, but was wondering if anyone had seen it in person.
