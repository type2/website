&gt;Today checked the valve settings. All but three were .006. The others were
&gt;.008
&gt;Thats good! ?


More play is better then tightening.......

&gt;Compression was 105 110 105 110
&gt;Sounds good.

Compression of 100 is going bad. Your readings are not good. I would suggest 
looking at muir and trying the oil in the spark plug holes trick and 
figuring out what the problem is. Or am I wrong is 110 good?
You guys let me know. My 1600 I sold had solid 140 all way round. Thats what 
I have come to expect from a used GOOD engine.
