Subject: 019 dizzy

Hello, All...
   I seem to remember a thread some time ago about the 019 distributor,
but I can't seem to find it in the archives.(hmmm, maybe I'm going
nuts?)
   Anyway, what is the general consensus of the 019 (as I am now a
proud(?) owner of one), compared to a stock vacuum and others such
as an 009?
Thanks!
