Hi all,

Well it's official, yesterday I regestered my YOM license plates.  The look
on their faces when I puled out a pair of brand new 1956 plates with a &quot;57
sticker.  The local DMV was a flurry.  It took almost 2 hours to process
because no one had a clue as to what to do.  They pulled out books and
procedure manuals and played on the computer.  Finally they took my $35 and
gave me a temp. sticker.  B14150.

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
