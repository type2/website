hi all,

Last night i worked on my 61 some more, i was going to pull the engine to
check the clutch to flywheel bolts, but decided they were fine and not the
problem. (i tightened em well, just didnt whip out the beam torque
wrench..)

It sounded like there was an awful lot of valve clatter when i was running
it the first time so i decided to recheck the valves now that i know which
is #1 and which is #3. and you wont believe this...

EVERY SINGLE VALVE WAS AT 1/8 INCH LASH!!!

I think the awful raket i heard was a rocker hitting the valve cover, i
mean man were these things off...  I re-set them all to the proper
position and that was quite an improvement ill say... My guess is that the
oil was gummy and the lifters were stuck in their bores, so from turning
the engine bedfore adjusting they were all stuck at max lift.  When i ran
it with fresh oil, they went back in place and increased the lash to a
ridiculous ammount, im surprised it ran at all to be honest. Either that
or i totally screwed up the adjustment the first time.. hehe.

Since the battery was dead and my girlfriend (Hi Corie) had the jumper
cables i set to doing other things while i waited.  I replaced the axle
seal on the drivers side stub axle. refilled the RGB and topped off the
center section. Safety wired the shifter couler nuts.  Greased the front
end (after bout a hundred miles or so im going to adjust the linkpins, i
wanted to get em moving again before i adjust em...)

Put on the rear apron, fixed the return spring on the carb, then... the
big one...

Took the bus down off the jackstands and torqued up the stub axle nuts and
the wheel lug nuts... so it was sitting on all fours...  wow that looked
cool, i'd begun to think splittes should be a foot taller than they are...

When i went inside to get an aircleaner and the hubcaps my girlfriend
showed up.

We took the jumper cables and the bus started right up, and it ran as
smoooth as silk after some twiddling of the 34 pict 3, the quad monza
exhaust even sounded pretty good to me :) (plus it looks so funky on there
im sure that will get me points in the beater category at the junebug
jamboree )

We went to drive it and the clutch wasnt adjusted, so i crawled under and
did that...

We bundled up because it was cold out, and the bus has no windshields and
took off around the block.  Wow what fun, my first drive in my first
splitty. (well, christine the 67 from hell was technically my first, but
it was almost too far gone to be even called a bus. And it had no chance
of ever driving again really..) It died at the top of the hill near my
house, on our second round the block trip, but we rolled it back down the
hill, got some more gas/jump started it and put it back in the garage.  I
think the problem was as simple as a worn out positive battery cable and
some hinky wiring on the generator... I will dig into that tonight and put
in the windshields probably.

We did make it around the block once though, i must say it was exciting as
heck, driving a split feels way different than driving my 71, but i like
it...  the open windshields was fun, i may have to look into the safari
thing a bit more... But much to do first before i get to that...

the shifting was way messed up... smooth as silk but hard to find gears,
and they seemed awfully close together, and the reverse lockout wasnt
working.  I may have installed that silly plate under the shifter
backwards, but i dont think so.  It works, but you have to know the bus
and where the gears are or you wouldnt be able to drive it too well..

Trying to go into first it feels like you are hitting a brick wall, but if
you go halfway between where first and fourth should be, there is first...

Trying to grab second you'll get reverse unless you aim right. Im hoping i
didnt bend something trying to unstick that front coupler with my big ass
hammer...

So, thats my story and im sticking to it.  Hope y'all have enjoyed my
progress reports as much as i've enjoyed writing em... Hopefully i'll be
so busy driving my bus in a few weeks that the progress reporrts will
dwindle a bit, but until then i will keep everyone informed (probably more
infomed than you want to be but how i do love to write about busses...)

take care,

Steve
