Subject: help!daily driver head stud stripped

Hey, I noted a exhaust leak between #2cylinder and head and just checked the 
bolt torque.  Results:none, I thought it must have really loosened up, but 
after 2 turns I started to wonder and sure enough the stud was coming out of 
the case.  Any ideas what to do?  This is my only way to work, and I'll 
gladly buy a stock engine if I need to to buy some time to get this one 
fixed.  Anyone in WA got one for sale?  A long block would even do just 
fine.  I doubt I could find a business open on the fourth to supply a part 
that day.  Thanks for the help and Happy driving--Chet
