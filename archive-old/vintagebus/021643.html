Subject: Re: truck drivers on my road trip :(

I usually take one of the busses to San Diego a couple times a year.  usually 
in the 67 kombi with the 1600sp and stock tranny.  All the times that I have 
been out on th road I have had very good luck with th truckers.  Most of the 
bus friends I have either are or were truckers at one time.  There has even 
been some close calls in which I owe the truckers for saving my life.

Theres always a bad seed but overall truckers are in the same boat as us and 
they dont want any problems.  It kinda fun with a radio too, listening to the 
comments aout your bus and/or your girlfriend in the passenger seat ;)
