Subject: [VB] Engine conversion mileage?

I posted this on the type2 and vanagon lists, but for some reason missed
vintagebus.  Duh.  Anyway, it's relevant here, too.

A question for any of you who've converted your bus to a non-vw engine:

I've been considering a Subaru conversion in my hypothetical bus project (I
say hypothetical because my project bus is 2000 miles away, and I might just
have to get another since it's not in great shape and the title's a mess
anyway).  I've searched the type2 and vanagon archives, and have found no
mention of the fuel consumption with such a conversion.

What sort of mileage do you see with your converted bus?  Provide specs
(What year is is?  Westy? Syncro?  Do you drive fast or slow?  Highway or
city?  Mountains?  What's the weather like?), and I'll post a summary of the
answers I receive...

TIA!
