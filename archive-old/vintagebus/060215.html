'It is in the town next to you' WHERE??



&gt; Hi all,
&gt; A friend of mine, not on the list, has a 65 Dormobile for 
&gt; sale. As far as  I can tell, it has all the correct pieces, the seats 
&gt; have been reupholstered, no engine at present. The front floors need 
&gt; renewing, the rear cargo area are pretty good and the drivers side 
&gt; rocker needs replacement. If you have any interest I would be willing 
&gt; to go and check things for you, no digital camera, as it is in the 
&gt; next town to me. He is asking $750/BO. Email me offlist and I can 
&gt; check/pass your name along.
&gt; Mike - 67 Deluxe
