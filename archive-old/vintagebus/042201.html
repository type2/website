Adrian
there was a bit of misinfo in your post.
Hall Effect in the dizzy is referring to a magnetic triggering device
which points arent but a pertronix is. 
The CDI differs in that the initial charge is generated by an oscillator
circuit and stored in a capacitor (like a photo flash).
Voltage in this case approx 500.
In a conventional system the primary is charged by 12v triggered by the
points closure and the primary coil windings.
As speed increases a conventional system has difficulty keeping up with
the charge/discharge cycle and spark efficiency suffers.
The CDI does not suffer from this, and also generates a more robust spark
at all RPMs. Easier starts and better fuel efficiency are to be expected.
If you keep conventional points they will not be subject to electrial wear
ie arcing or burning and maint will be reduced.
A pertronix or other electronic points replacement will also eliminate
dwell adjustments and are more tolerant (in my experience) of disributor
wear and will eliminate the entire points maint cycle.
I once roughly calculated that the cost of a pertronix over its warranty
period of 18 months is similar to a daily driven busses points cost over
that same period. Ive had the same unit in for better than 2x that so it
has been a cost savings device as well.
CDI and Points repl modules are 2 seperate items.
CDI replaces nothing but does give a performance increase.
Points modules replace er...points (and condenser) 
Reduced maint and hopefully increased reliability will result.
Together they make a relatively modern ignition system upgrade with many
of the advantages.
