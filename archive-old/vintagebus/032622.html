foreign aide in albuquerque (1-800-658-5712) does good trannies.  the
builder, bob, has been doing them since '63 (vw factory trained) and can do
a good one for you.  he replaces anything that looks bad and puts new
bearings (mainshaft, pinion )in regardless, and all new synchros, too. 
he'll also update to later innards for strength.  call them for more
details.  they may not have one in stock, but can do one for you in a
couple of days.  talk directly to bob if you can to tell him exactly what
you're looking for and he'll tell you exactly what he does.  just please be
aware that bob works in the back and may not have prices available to him,
or a ton of time to spend on the phone.  also, please specify it is for a
bus.


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; Anyway, I'm looking for opinions as to whether or not I should replace it
&gt; before we leave or just bungee-cord the stick for the trip home. Called a
&gt; few shops in SoCal and they do not stock bus transaxles. Can anyone
&gt; recommend a good trans rebuilder; one that replaces all relevant parts and
&gt; not just the sychros?
