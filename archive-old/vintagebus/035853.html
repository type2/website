&gt;&quot;So...how may slats are on a westy roof rack&quot;
&gt;
&gt;looking out the window here from work i count 13, made mine out of redwood
&gt;

I have 15 slats on mine, and the slats are 53 inches long, not 48.
Of course, I have never seen another wood slat rack like mine.  I suspect 
that most racks are the 13 slat 48 inch varieity.
Does anyone know if the 58 and earlier racks had the same brass tags as the 
late model westy wood slat racks?
