My friends, 

I went out today in the company of John Anderson (the original voice of
reality - &quot;Junk, Steve, it's junk!&quot;) and took along my digital camera.  I
have put 27 (actually, 28) color glossy pictures of the bus at the
following URL:

http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/67bus

there are thumbnails and some day, who knows...I might even write some
html :-)

The question I gotta ask myself (and do ask you) is &quot;Is this a heart
breaker or is it a do-able project?&quot;  Please take a look and let me know
what you think.  

Some of the pictures did not come out as well as I would have liked and in
review, I did not take some that I should have.  The bits not pictured, or
pictured poorly include:

rust:
the doors are all pretty toasty at the bottom;
the rocker at the double door is gone, but the damagedoes not extend in
too much;
there is ~6&quot; of the passenger windshield bottom flange that will be pretty
bad;
the front floor on the driver's side has a lot of surface rust.  I fear
what will happen when it gets sandblasted (can you say &quot;swiss cheese&quot;?)

plate1.JPG and plate2.JPG show the stats on it...

VIN = 237003067 

build date 08 '67

M-codes: 425 ?
         A42 SO-42 Westy
         025 lap belt anchors
         103 heavy duty shocks

other  - UK -  US, any idea what port?? (betting Baltimore :-)
         2312 body type - kombi shell, but what does the &quot;2&quot; mean?
         523907 paint codes? These numbers don't match anything on 
	 the NEATO page :-( I am betting white was the
         original color.  Nothing in the door jambs says different.
         7003067 - all the VIN's match :-)

                           H Steven Dolan
