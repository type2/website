Subject: Re: Question about Belly Pans?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Greetings-
   I wholeheartedly agree with Clara regarding the removal of belly pans.  You
need to evaluate the need for such a task first.  Do you have rust in your
floors, the belly pans, or both?  Is it surface rust or eaten through?  If it
is eaten through, can it be patched in a few places and grinded down to look
original?
   The reason I ask these questions is that I hate to see someone tackle belly
pans if not needed.  There are no after-market pans that have the same depth
of drain insets that the original factory pans have.  I did unfortunately have
to replace mine this past year.  While Das Bulli Haus has nice reproductions
that fit very well,  they still do not look exactly like factory.   
   The removal of the pans is a very painful task.  We were forced to use a
combination of cutting wheels and air powered chisels.  This was while we were
laying on our backs!  (Not all of us are as fortunate as Charlie Hamill to
have a rotisserie in our shop.)  You must then spend hours grinding down the
old welds and prepping the surface to accept new welds.  The rewelding of new
pans is even worse, as the combination of clamping pans and grinding down new
welds proves to be very painful on the neck and arms.
     I do not personally see how a person can remove the complete pan off of
the framerail without damaging it.  There are 4 sections which include the
left and right side and a front and rear center section.  These are very well
secured to the framerail, outriggers and inner rockers.  I suppose that you
could use a cutoff wheel to remove only the center portion of the belly pan
between the mounting points.  But, repositioning the sections to stay while
&quot;butt-welding&quot; will prove even more challenging.
   I will argue the point that you &quot;can&quot; drive the bus after removing the
belly pans.  This is provided you are careful not to damage any of the rest of
the structure.  If the outriggers, rockers, and frame are reasonably solid,
then it will be the same supporting structure as in a Kombi, etc.  Just to be
safe, you will need to properly support the bus in the event you find rust in
the outriggers, etc.  This will prevent the body from sagging should you be
forced to replace any of the main supporting structure.

Hope This Helps!
Scott
