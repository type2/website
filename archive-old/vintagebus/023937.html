Subject: Thing Rims on bus?

I noticed that thing rims have a different offset than bus rims.

The Thing rims move the tire further out from the axel.
I was wondering if putting thing rims on the rear of the bus would
increase the stability in crosswinds
or if there is a compellilng reason not to do this.  Looks like they
would fit.

Thanks,
...Markus
