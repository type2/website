Subject: Re: [VB] thinking of selling my bus- anyone have regrets?

'64 Deluxe
Rusty, slow, watertight, utterly reliable.
Big regrets on selling it when getting married.
Wish I still had this slow beast.

'67 Deluxe
Speedy, little rust, utterly undependable, broke every time I drove it 
any distance
Hated this bus, couldn't wait to sell it.

'66 Standard
Root beer brown, read shag carpeting, no engine.
Sold it when convinced by spouse to do so.
Regret it to this day, even during the selling process
I thought about going back on the deal, but didn't.
Big time regret selling this solid bus.

'67 hardtop deluxe
spent lots to get it, lots to fix it, everytime I touched
it I found something major wrong, so I stopped looking,
and sold it before I found out more
Needed to sell this money pit.

'76 Camper, great bus, totally reliable, but rolled it
in black ice, major bummer.

'80 Vanagon had it for 14 years, but it started to
wear out and become expensive to maintain.

Bottom line, if you have a bus that is basically
reliable, keep it. If you don't know enough about it
to tell, ask for some help here to figure what's wrong and
what it'll take to get it there. Looks are minor compared
to functional reliability.

Jeff - no more busses, sigh
