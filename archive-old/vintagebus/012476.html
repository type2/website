Texas 

our hero droned on

Texas

Texas forever 
west Texas on and on and on
there is an adjective so bleak, so vacuous as to describe it and it is
that noun; TEXAS

Oh there were moments like El paso, with the second biggest mexican flag
he'd ever seen
waving over the boarder. Were the hills were covered with shacks like
zits on a prom
dates face. Yes Mexico had shown him its backside but the rest of the day
was filled with the dread Texas. 
The weather looked like all outdoors  bigger than his island sky; where
on top of Mt.
Ka'ala it's green spires pulled the vast blue to him and covered his
heart like a
comforter.When he was eight miles out on the big blue ocean the Waianae
range was like tent poles holding it up over the Nanakuli, Waianae and
his beloved Makaha valleys. But not this sky...
No, this sky was the hand of the just God that at any moment  would
billow and foment
and thunderously blast him into the dust from whence he came. 
As he crawled like a roach across the launch pad of a saturn five rocket
well aware that the count down might end before he crossed, he saw a man
more foolish than even he. A hitch hiker on the road to no ware.
Once in the cab of the bus that freak preceded to tell him all about how
he rebuilt &quot; with a friend&quot; a sooped up vw engine and other pearls of 
wisdom. 
Our hero let him of at the next overpass seventy five miles down the
road.
