listees,

   if your thinking of rebuilding your bus tranny i highly recommend i.t.s . 
I just recently put my order in with Pat and he has gven me the best service. 
I.T.S has also the best price ive have seen
i was originaly  going to purchase from rancho performance transaxles but 
then some one told me its, so i gave them a call they quoted me almost 200.00 
less than rancho, and since i live in san jose
and they are in the san diego area Pat has agreed to meet me on a 
saturday(which they are no open)
so i can get it AND he will also give me a tour of his shop.so i highly 
recomend i.t.s.
