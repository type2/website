 &lt;&lt; yes VW did change the design of the axles slightly, some have the ball, 
 some 
  dont.  However, this change was not at the split case/tunnel change, and if 
 you read your Bentley in the axle section it does say they are 
 interchangable.  its one of those changes I doubt they changed the part 
 number for. &gt;&gt;
 Hi Volks,
 1963 to 67 VW bus Shop Manual Section H-5, near the top of page 3 states:
 From April 1964, Chassi No. 1285367, the rear axle shafts and differential 
 side gears are paired together again.  At the same time, the spring and ball 
 in the axle shaft flange was discontinued.  The fitting clearance between 
the 
 flange if the axle shaft (Measured across the ball-shaped faces) and the 
 inside diameter if the side gear is 0.03-0.01mm (.001-.004 in.).
 Eric&amp;Barb &gt;&gt;

right-  did you check what the parts lists says about the axle shafts?  I 
don't have my parts list handy.  
 Have you swapped the crown/side gears around on the axle shafts?   The ones 
VW implies should not be swapped.  Should I throw away a good axle shaft if 
the paired crown gear is bad? What do you do if that crown gear is cracked or 
fubar?  I have swapped these bits around and it works.   ya check the pieces 
are not too tight, but really the difficult part is finding the pieces that 
are not excessively worn.  And often when searching for parts to replace the 
worn ones I either cannot or would rather not use, the pieces I find are not 
tidily kept together in sets, but I find an axle here, a pair there, some 
crown gears and fulcrum plates out of a bug (much less worn)  some bits at a 
swap, some bits at a shop. (Imagine going into a shop and asking for a crown 
gear and wanting the paired axle with it.  They would laugh or tell you to go 
tear apart a tranny, some bits from a friend, theres enough in the end.   
Then  (make sure you dont mismatch fulcrum plates) fit it all together and 
get out the feeler guage....  

I guess what I meant by they used the same axle shafts was not to say they 
were exactly the same all the way through, but that they are functionally 
interchangable.  And that you can keep the same axles/RGBoxes from a split 
case trans and swap them to a tunnel case. I am sorry if I was confusing
