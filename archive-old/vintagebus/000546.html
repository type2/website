I've also had the same problem when some of the braided line last years, and 
some of the same stuff last a few months.  I wonder if it is old stock? 
When MTBE first came out it wreaked havoc with the older cars.  Not just 
lines but fuel pumps and carbs too. When the story broke the local news 
interviewed hot rodders and showed footage of a bus on fire. ouch. 
 Unocal 76 gas does not have MTBE in it, so I try to patronize them as often 
as possible. They have a sticker on the pump with their proclamation. 
As was mentioned always use clamps, and inspect your fuel system for leaks 
regularly!
