&gt; &lt;&lt; anyway, the engine's in and running ok. the top end feels great but it
&gt; seems
&gt;  to lack the ooomph i thought it would have on hills and such. i dunno,
never
&gt;  had a new engine before. maybe it'll be better after break in?

&gt; Hi Have you checked to make sure that the carb jets are correct for your
size
&gt; engine, plus year and type of VW?   Eric &amp; Barb
  
I would think along the same lines as the purchaser of the engine. Turn key
is turn key!! A vendor selling a 1600 &quot;should&quot; have the carb jetted for the
1600 irregardless of the vehicle the purchaser is putting it into, duh!

Gary (who's thinking of taking his superbly running 1600 and putting it
into his 62 crewcab but thinks he'll have to rejet the carb) &gt;G&lt;
