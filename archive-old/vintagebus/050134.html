Subject: Re: 6V -&gt; 12V Wipers, it's ALMOST there


&gt;If you can, use the ORIGINAL switch!  6V switches wire up about the same
&gt;and don't mind 12v at all.

I should have been more clear. The 12V wiper motors have two speeds,
including one that is actually capable of keeping up with the rain, which
is absent on the 6V. I want the new switch because without it I'd lose the
two-speed capacity.
