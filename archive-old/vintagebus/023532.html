&lt;&lt; I believe that my engine number is 5080310 - which, I think, makes it an 
engine from a 61 beetle.  My bus is a 60 std.  I believe that the p&amp;c's are 
bigger than stock.  Maybe my engine is 1400, or 1500 on what was originally a 
40 hp.  But I could be wrong on all of the above. &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
And/or they could have installed the later 69mm crankshaft.  Which means you 
could have a 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600 in there just to mention the more 
likely possibilities!  Is it fresh air or stale air heating?  What is the 
part number on the intake manifold?   Eric&amp;Barb
