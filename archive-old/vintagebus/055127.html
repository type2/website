&gt; AL (Having never seen a one piece one :) )

I've seen one, but immediately replaced it with a 2-piece tin.

&gt; Hi Al,
&gt; Not quite!  There were at least two versions of this passenger side under
&gt; tin
&gt; used in 1300, 1500, and 1600.  The one piece that made it more of a pain to
&gt; install/adjust the thermostat and the two piece that allowed the rear third
&gt; of the tin to be removed to work on the thermostat.  If you used the latter
&gt; make sure to used bolts to attach the two pieces together.  Engine tin
&gt; screws
&gt; which were stock there do not allow enough torque and loosen resulting in
&gt; loss of this rear tin piece!   Eric&amp;Barb

I've never had a problem with these screws loosening any more than the
reat of the tin.  I just take a big screwdriver and tighten everything up
every 10K or so.

There are a few places where hex bolts should be used in place of cheese
head screws to facilitate removal.  These are the ends of the fan shroud,
to attach the little heat riser seals to the breastplate, and where the
fan shroud attaches to the Hoover bit.  In all these cases, the hex head
screws are easier to remove than cheese head screws becauase direct access
to these screws is blocked by other parts.
