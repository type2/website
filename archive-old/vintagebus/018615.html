I recently bought a bunch of stuff from Alan Schofield; he makes the
stuff DBH was selling.

Wolfgang is a West Coast distributor for him; don't know who distributes
the stuff in other parts of the country.  Go to their website -
http://www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk/ - and submit an info request, and they'll
tell you where to get stuff stateside.  They let me buy my stuff direct due
to the large amount I was ordering (more than some of you have paid for your buses!)

&gt; recommendations on who is providing quality panels these days?
