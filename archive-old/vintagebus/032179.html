&gt;a tire with a 25&quot; diameter has about a 78 inch circumference, which is
&gt;about 6.5 feet, which is a fair bit more than 1/800th of a mile....so
&gt;you gotta spin it roughly 800 times to click over a mile.

&gt;From what I have seen elsewhere (not on VW) I am pretty sure the
speedo cable does not run that fast but has a much reduced rpm relative to
the tire rotation ...or not so on VW?
In any case the parts that make up the odo drive are probably pretty dry
and I wouldnt subject them to such a highspeed procedure.
