Subject: Re: [VB] More bad manners

&lt;&lt;Sending (at least) four airplanes on a suicide mission to kill
thousands of unsuspecting citizens and cause mass chaos does not send
the
message &quot;Hey, let get together and chat about our differences.&quot;&gt;&gt;

Thanks Dan, for that beautiful analysis. Believe it or not, there are a
few on the list who, like Jerry Falwell, think it is all our fault.
These people can rationalize it for any number of different ways, but
when asked to explain themselves in Pmail, simply shut up, because deep
down in side they know their idiotic positions to be indefensible. Logic
and reason means nothing to these people and makes them in many ways
similar to the Talibad (spelling intentional).

Jerry Falwell even suggested that perhaps Israel had financed the
attack. Can You imagine the unmitigated gall of that asshole. He will
surely burn in hell.
