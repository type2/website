&gt; Any idea how much increase engine temp this is responsible for if missing?

Hi Scott,
Like Clara says it ones of those things that adds up.  Also it depends on the 
outside temp and RPMs you are going to push!  We do know you get a 20F degree 
drop by just adding in the front engine tin in 70ishF weather _at_ 3,000 RPM!
