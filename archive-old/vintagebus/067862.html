Subject: Re: [VB] Towing with a Freeway Flyer

I'm wondering, how many have taken the attention to the powerplant only,
leaving stock gearing and building a high torque, RPM capable monster
(balanced CW nickies, big displacement, high $$ rods, etc?) for even
more pulling power and withstanding tons of R's to drive too fast?
Beefing the center section sound feasible here also. Myself, I'll be
driving slow... :)
AL

 I have replaced my small nut with a big
&gt; nut reduction boxes to give me a little better top end on my '60.  I have
&gt; researched all the different ways to get a higher top speed (freeway flyers,
&gt; IRS, lowered swing axel) and to me, it doesn't seem like it's worth the time
&gt; and money to do it.   I've towed&gt; my Love Bug (similar to a scamp) with a 1970 with a 1600cc to Everybus.  It
&gt; was a little tough on the long climbs.  I am having a 1904cc built  for
&gt; torque not for speed, in order to pull The Love Bug.
