Vintagebusers:

Just updated our club's webpage to include a trip report by a member who
recently visited South Africa to check out the VW scene there, and a
club trip to nearby Puyallup, Washington show and swap meet.

Both are written, for once, by someone other trhan me! You may
appreciate this as much as I do.

Both these reports may shed some light upon listee Ty Hodges, although
neither are written by him either. You may want to check it out soon, as
Ty may make me take it down.
