Subject: Re: [VB] 241 walk through  / WAS slider deluxes /was front seat
  area? 

i do have 081, but so do  a lot of the 251's in the vb registry. the vb
registry shows 40 other buses with the 241/081 combo. so maybe  the 241 is
really more of an indicator for the full width middle seat then?  i don't have
any issues of the obr.

  hmm, your bus has m 080 or m 081, right?
    there is a code for full width middle seat for walkthroughs, I forget
which it is.
  NEATO did an M code survey a few years back,   I seem to remember that VW
didn't always do the mcodes the same way... and that one bus had about 3
(more?) codes for being a walkthrough.   If you didn't get that OBR, I could
go dig it up.  I think Dave Easterwood was handling the M code info.   He
might be able to tell you how many buses in the survey had that combo.

    this is something that i've been wondering about. the 241's are always
    refered to as bench seat or 9 seater buses, even in factory literature
that
    i've seen. my 64 deluxe is a walk through with the 241 model number. BUT
it
    did have a full width middle seat, making it an 8 seater. the bus also
has
    m427 that is unkown. anyone else have a 241 walk through deluxe? or a 22
    walk through standard?
