Subject: Re: [VB] AGAIN an aluminum case update

I would be very interested in aircooled_dot_net's
list of known defects of the new aluminum
type 1 cases. There seems to be considerable
confusion regarding this, and the frequency
in which they appear.
My first inquiry  regarding the cases was at
the # 5000 mark, and I was told the only
verified defect was a problem with packaging
and breakage in shipment, and some minor
cleaning issues.
It now appears that some defects have been resolved
only to be replaced by several significant others.
Checking a case for defects is one thing.
( Finding them is quite another :)

Aircooled_dot_net has an interesting sales pitch.
They offer a WARRANTY for $50 to cover defects,
and &quot;will not refund in-house machining options
without it&quot;. Evidently, having a case machined by
a trained professional is not enough to guarantee
the case you haven't seen yet does not contain
any known defects. It also does not cover shipping costs.
I assume the warranty is also not refundable when you
discover the obvious defect and use it to secure
the refund, and not purchasing the warranty will guarantee
NO refund of an obviously defective case.
Does this make any sense ?
What is the time limit of this warranty period ?

What are the statistical odds of anyone getting
a defective case WITHOUT your warranty plan ?
What are the statictical odds of anyone getting
TWO defective cases WITH your warranty plan :) ?!

&gt;We at Aircooled.Net have not sold a single Aluminum case
&gt; without letting the customer know about problems that have become common
&gt; with these cases. Almost all cases we sell end up being first sent to a
&gt; machine shop to be worked on, then passed onto the customer. Usually if we
&gt; sell an aluminum case to a customer without it going through the machine
&gt; shop first, it is to a reputable engine builder that can perform the
machine
&gt; work themselves, or someone that has a local machine shop close to them
that
&gt; they prefer.
&gt;
&gt; We still do not feel the aluminum engine cases are to a point that someone
&gt; can simply buy it, and slap together an engine without any checks done to
&gt; the case. Mag cases are ususally what we recommend to people unless they
are
&gt; running a HUGE power plant anyway.
&gt;
&gt; Like I have said before, the aluminum cases are fantastic, BUT only after
&gt; all the gremlins are 'tweaked' out of them.  :-)
