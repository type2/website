&gt; thanks list &gt;&gt;

You'll have to disconnect the motor at the bellhousing to disconnect it from 
the transmision, and you'll most likely have to take off the rear apron and 
remove the bolts on the rear engine carrier while supporting the motor and 
sliding it backward with a jack, so the pilot shaft in the transmission can 
clear the flywheel on the motor, and if you have a transmission with the rear 
upper carrier above the bell housing, you'll have to disconnect those two 
bolts - plus you would need two jacks instead of just one.....and most 
importantly there's no benefit to just leaving the motor supported by the 
jack in the engine compartment and working around it - it would actually be 
hazardous. the answer to your question is '&quot;NO. Take the motor out then the 
transmission. and replace in reverse order. Hope this helps.
