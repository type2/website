&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I will sell the bus for $800.00.
&gt; 
&gt; I know I could get a lot more than that by parting
&gt; it out..
&gt; (empi steps, jail bars, trim, seats, clock, corner
&gt; glass, bumper...etc. 
&gt; etc.)
&gt; I love the bus and do not want to part it out...have
&gt; to move to San Diego 
&gt; (NAVY)...
&gt; 
&gt; The first persone to make a deposit of $400.00 in my
&gt; pay-pal acount gets it.
