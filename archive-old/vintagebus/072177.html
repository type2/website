&gt; I jump out (at a safe distance from the 70+ MPH traffic) and open the 
&gt; engine lid to find a lot of oil had blown out of the hole on the passenger side of 
&gt; the fan
&gt; housing (pictured here:

Hi Greg,
That is not good!  Best guess is your oil cooler has a leak or the seals to 
it.  Remove cooler, have cooler pressure checked and cleaned, and replace oil 
cooler seals.  As for getting it so hot, more than likely you have damaged some 
of the main/rod bearings.

&gt; The engine was hot, real hot.  I tried to check the oil, but since a lot of 
&gt; it
&gt; was dripping out onto the muffler and that dipstick was just short of 
&gt; glowing,
&gt; I thought I should let it cool a little while.  After a few minutes (10) I
&gt; still had to use a rag to grab the dipstick.  I seemed to have too much oil
&gt; still.  Perhaps I put to much in and the excess blew out the top???

Was the bus on flat ground?  If the nose was uphill the oil would be tipped 
to the rear inside the sump.  Never bother to check oil till at least ten 
minutes after running and we prefer 15 minutes so as to insure the oil in the 
cooler and passages has drained completely.

&gt;   One of the guys that stopped by was in a caravan of about 5 VW's from the 
&gt; Woodburn show and offered up a thought that the oil somehow had expanded 
&gt; after it heated up, thus making it seem like there was more.  Any thoughts on 
&gt; that?

It is not going to do that!

&gt; The next day, I dig in.  I pulled the engine myself (not bad for my second
&gt; time doing it) and stripped the fan housing off to find the Oil Cooler in 
&gt; the
&gt; doghouse (FYI... '74 DP engine).  It was pretty nasty.  The grates were full
&gt; of crud, so it could be that the air wasn't flowing through very well.  I
&gt; pressure washed it (blocking off the holes first) and it came out pretty 
&gt; good.
&gt; I cleaned up everything else I could find while I had it open.

Remove the rest of the engine tin and heater boxes, down to a long block and 
retorque all the case and then head fasteners!  Because it over heated these 
need to be retoqued and who knows when it was retorqued last.

  I then went to &gt; put the fan housing (with generator/fan) back onto the 
&gt; engine.  I can get the driver's side on well
&gt; (http://community.webshots_dot_com/photo/75454343/75455106dBpwwB) and the flap
&gt; pulley mechanism moves freely.  The passenger side though is an issue.  
&gt; First
&gt; of all, the flap pulley mechanism does not move freely.  It moves, but not
&gt; very well.  Something might be blocking it.  Any thoughts on how to seat th
&gt; is
&gt; properly?  Here is the picture...

Sounds like you have the rod for the thermostic flaps in the wrong hole or 
jammed.  Also check that the curved arm that hold the top of this rod has a 
popsicle stick width of space between it and the flap it is riveted to.

&gt; Last question and I will call it quits for this e-mail (thanks for hanging 
&gt; in there on this one...).  There is a wire to the backside of the flywheel 
&gt; housing.  I can't tell what it goes to (again... this is a '74 DP engine from a 
&gt; bug).  Here are some pictures:

&gt; What the heck is this?  Do I need it?  How do I wire it?

Just leave it!  It is a fuel injection sensor.
