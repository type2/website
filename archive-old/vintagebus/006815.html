If you are useing Nason get a couple gallons extra, you'll need it in a year
when the paint chips, peels and fades out.  On my 67 Sudial it took a quart
to paint below the beltline (this was before reducing) and a gallon to do
the roof, down to beltline and interior, I used PPG's low end OMNI, the
sundial has been gone for a couple of years now, but I still have my DD
which I used the same paint, great paint for a resale vehical, but I will
never use it again on a bus I want to keep, it holds up OK but I am not
really happy with the strength of the paint. When I paint the 59 single I am
going to use PPG DELSTAR 3 times the money, but will pay off in the long
run, this information was told to me by my PPG supplier, OMNI is a great
selling product but it is low end and will show in the long run. If useing
Nason, step up and have your paint supplier move you up to a better Quality
Sherwin Williams paint (Nason is their budget line)

ps.  if Dupont still made Centari I would use it. 15 year old paint jobs on
Porsche's I did still look awesome, but of course most of these are garage
whores.

So I'm thinking that it would be good to spend my birthday (today) going to
town and ordering the paint for our bus(+1) and getting a sandblaster.  (The
$100 sandblaster would be good to have...I'd use it on tougher areas as
paint removal, and the bumpers I'd also use it on would cost $25 each to
dip.....).  Please let me know if I should definitely not use it for
paint/rust removal on panels...?

How much paint should I get?  I have no problem getting extra of the L87
Pearl White, as I'll need enough for two buses anyway, but I don't know how
to figure the amount of Sea Blue that I'll need for the under-the-beltline
exterior only on our '66.  I'm using Nason single-stage catalyzed urethane,
by the way.

Thanks,

Gene
