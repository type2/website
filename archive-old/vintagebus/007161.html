Subject: Hail on NQ

&gt; The weather states tornadoes and hail in Beatrice. I hope NQ used one of
&gt; those checks to pay his property insurance!  He must be in the basement

Yes indeed Kevin, we had some golf ball sized hail tonight.  On a dare, my
sister ran outside in her bare feet in the rain, hail, and mud and fetched
one which we now have in the freezer as trophy/testament to the weather.

3 tornado warnings in an hour.  Strong rotation but as of now, no touchdowns
reported.  It sure could have though - that was some mean looking stuff.  Ah
Nebraska - gotta love it.

ObVW:  The VWs are fine - matches the other little rock chips and dents that
are already there.
