Subject: '59 Kombi DP 1600cc engine assembly

I'm in the process of assembling my DP1600cc engine to put back in my 
'59 Kombi. This is my first engine overhaul.

I'm adjusting the valves and get to the #3 Exhaust valve. The problem 
is that even with the adjusting screw backed off all the way, there 
is no space between the rocker arm and the valve. I rotated the crank 
a little both ways to make sure the valve spring was all the way 
extended. It was and the problem is always there.

Any ideas or suggestions appreciated.
