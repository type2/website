This might lead to a sweligant solution to the earlier poster asking about charging 6 and 12 volt batteries. If the correct pulley size could be determined and attached, perhaps a good 6 volt generator could supply power to the 6 volt battery while the 12-volt generator did it's thing.

Well, it's a thought. :) Joe
