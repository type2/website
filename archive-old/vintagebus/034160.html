The mirros on E bay in my opinion are the same repo's I sell for 18 dollars
a piece
I just looked at 10 of the repops and the emblem (VW stamping) al have
complete circles around them, whoever mentioned the incomplete circle just
happened to have one with a poor stamping.

NOW the difference!!! On the repops the VW part numbers all run together and
on the original, as per the picture posted by JP, each set of 3 numbers has
a space between them, other wise it would be hard to tell. I saw a couple of
people at Pomona selling the repops as NOS, but did see 1 person who did
have a NOS pair for 75 each in the original package, whats going to happen
when someone starts repoping the original boxes?

Now a little storie. Back in the mid 60's and early 70's my mother owned a
box company, one of her biggest customers was V o A in cal, she sold them
all the boxes that they repackaged parts in, as a lot of parts came over in
pallet boxes and were put in there individual boxes here in the states, If I
only knew then what I know today, I used to delivery emergancy orders there,
would drive in and there would be 1000's of new Porsche and VW engines in
crates just sitting in the yard, used to cruise the warehouse, row after row
of VW and Porsche parts, now if I could only find where my mother stashed
all the leftover boxes and the cool stuff V o A use to give her, Somewhere
in compton, that's where her warehouse was.

I just took pictures of my original mirrors on the '59 Westy, and they have 
the VW symbol, the part number, and are followed by another symbol that I 
can't quite make out.

Look at the pics at the following site:

and

Hope this helps.
