Subject: Bus tee-shirts
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I've looked at every website and catalog and magazine
I could find, and haven't found what I want yet.
I'd like to find a nice tee shirt with a realistic
splitty double cab on it--no cartoonish
caricatures--and I'd prefer it to be a colored shirt
so as not to show grease so soon. Of course, ideally
it would be a Pearl White 1965 truck, but I'm not
&lt;that&gt; fussy.
Anyone know of a source of something like this?

Thanks

Jim (in Wis)
65 double cab
75 bus
