Subject: Re: Heater Tube and Gas heaters

If heat is your primary concern and you need to replace the tube I have a
BA-6 Gas heater for sale that mounts inline with your heating tube. These
things are the holy grail when it comes to heating a bus. First off they
produce approximately twice the BTU's as a BN-4 and since they are inline
they also defrost your windows, unlike a regular bus style. additionally
they have extra safety features that didn't come on the earlier ones. I
originally purchased mine to install in between the floor and belly pan of
my Samba but never did, I paid $400 for it years ago, and then another
$150.00 in replacement parts for it. It has never been installed in a bus
since I have owned it. If someone on the list wants it I will sell it for
the original $400.00 plus shipping. if not I will list it for sale to the
masses for more.
Secondly I have a near NOS SW under dash I may consider selling as well. I
bought it NOS about 4-5 years ago, shipped it to Colorado for service and
then installed it in a DD bus I had for awhile. It was installed for approx
4 months. This one I would need at least $500 for as I have close to twice
that in to it.
