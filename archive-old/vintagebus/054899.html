Subject: Re: [VB] Binz w/left-hand door??

Its not a Binz. Its a 60 DC model 267 owned by Peter Reichler from sweden 



&gt;That door is not a Binz door...at least not and early Binz door.  Maybe
&gt;someone is trying to make there own?  Maybe a four door Barndoor Binz?
&gt;Assuming that all the black and white photos are the &quot;Binz&quot;, the bulkhead
&gt;didn't look right
&gt;-Dan

&gt;It looks like a normal Double Cab to me.  It's probably just a LHD,
&gt;left-hand door model from Sweden or a similar area...
