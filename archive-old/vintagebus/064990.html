Subject: Re: [VB] RE: [T2] Snake oil or real product

Oil drains because there are four slots around the perimeter of the
strainer, but there is little flow through this region.
--------------------------
All I can say is find somebody breaking in a new engine and give it a
try. 
You'll be surprised at the amount of material you collect between the
aluminum strainer plate and the steel plate.
In an ideal test you'd be installing a new steel strainer plate each time
and holding about ten of them, wash all ten at the same time and I'll bet
you get a tablespoon or more of magnetic particles.
