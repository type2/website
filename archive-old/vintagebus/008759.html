&lt;&lt;i think the &quot;loose drain plug&quot; story is probably on an urban legends
website somewhere... though i am sure this happens from time to time, it is
still a classic paranoia-inducing tale.&gt;&gt;
&gt;
Sounds like an urban legend except for the fact that I knew someone in
Norcal with a GTI that this happened to.  Blew his engine at 60 mph on the
freeway with no recourse.  I didn't understand why Jiffy Lube (slander!)
didn't pay for a new engine but I didn't push the issue with him.

&gt; How about a loose oil filler cap.
&gt;
This happened to my wife, we noticed it after driving 7 hours, stopped for
gas and a little smoke started coming out.  Luckily it was in her POS '83
Accord so the hood basically covered the oil fill hole the entire time and
the oil loss and cleanup was quite minor.

No Bus content.  ;p
