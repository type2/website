Subject: Door Panels
Message-ID: &lt;36F9AA71.598FC79_at_sacto_dot_org&gt;

Hi Folks,
          I have the desire to replace my door and kick panels on my 63
Single Cab, I currently have a set of new appolstered ones in gray I was
going to use be I have decided to go stock,  I need to know if someone
knows of a company who is making repros of the correct materials?  I
guess I could just strip the panels and paint them gray.  I know this
subject was covered a bit ago so please pmail me with your responses to
keep the bandwidth freedup.  I'd like to thank all those super folks out
there who are always able to help those of us who are less adept at
VW's.

Peace,
Nathan
N. Highlands, Ca.
