Subject: HFBC trip report (long)

HCBF was one of the best bus events that I have ever attended. It would take
volumes to tell of all the good times I had there. Here are some of the
highlights.

Left at 8:15 am and met Jason of FasterLaster fame on I40 after a beautiful
morning drive up Jelico Mt..  He knew the way so I followed in what turned
out to be a very beautiful back road trip. Time passed, I don't know what
time I got  there. Said hello to people I knew, met a lot of nice people,
and slept like a baby.

Woke up Friday to beautiful weather, clean mountain air, and the excitement
of what I knew was coming.
Spent the day walking and talking and just laying around, welcoming people
that I knew, and meeting new ones. All the time, I was checking out buses,
talking buses, and generally having a day of relaxing. The cherries came out
at night and then it was Saturday.

Saturday was great. Weather was beautiful. The activities were better than
any event I have ever been at. Mark Dearing, of Salem Import Service fame,
gave a really informative and entertaining teck talked about VW engines and
gave some great tips on how to get home if you run into trouble on the road.
Lynn &amp; J spent most of the afternoon showing the kids how to tye-dye shirts.
I even did one myself.  Saturday night's raffle yielded $141.00 for the
type2.list (thanks to all who bought tickets) and the split-the-pot rally
got $92.00 for the FMBC. The band started, the cherries came out, I walked
and talked, and then it was Sunday.

Got up, packed up, and was on my way back to reality at about 8:00. Some of
you that know me, know that I am no good with directions. Got lost somewhere
on 105 or some other rd. and all of a sudden there was a Shell station.
Asked directions, a local tried to tell me to go here and turn left, then
turn right there,til the guy behind the counter said&quot;why not take the scenic
route,all two lane and kind of twisty, but no turns&quot; and I was on 321.  I
don't know which 321 I was on, but I had the most beautiful 2 hr. ride to
Johnson City. I was spiritual. Got home at 6:30 pm after only getting lost
two more times.

Goldie ran perfectly there, and thanks to Mad Uncle Dave Jersey, much better
on the way home, thanks to him showing me how to balance my carbs quickly
and perfectly. But then, that's how VW people are!!!!
