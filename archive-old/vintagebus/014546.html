Subject: Re: [VB] flasher burn out and 12-volt Wiper motor
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Shawn &amp; Chris,
Shawn take out the 6 volt flasher relay and resistor, then install a 12 volt 
relay.  The only really usefull place for a resistor/s is for the wiper motor 
or ambulance fan.  If one does install a 6 volt motor like these in a 12 volt 
converted VW one must check the voltage with the electric motor running to be 
about 6 volts with the engine not running.  We have found it often takes two 
if not more resistors to do the volt droppage properly!  As for your other 
wiring problems it is best you just sit down with wiring diagrams in hand and 
take a day or two to compleatly go through you wiring.  While you are doing 
this clean all the connections and apply silicon grease to keep the corrosion 
away.
  Chris you can use a post-1967 VW 12 wiper motor, but 6 volt bus units are 
very easy to find.  So using a set of resistors to drop the voltage and a 6 
volt motor results in a system that is alot easier to find replacement parts 
for if something goes wrong on the road and just bolt in without 
modification.  Resistors are availible out of wrecked later water cooled VWs 
from the heater blowers which use a resistor when switch to low speed.   If 
you do use the later 12 volt motor you have to pound a dimple in at least one 
of the tubes that defrost the windshield.  Think it was from a late 70s type 
1 and you have to do some modifications to the motor arm.  You can find the 
info for the late 12 volt motor in the archives.  Eric&amp;&amp;Barb
