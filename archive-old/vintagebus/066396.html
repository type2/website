  During the program in which they talked on the BMW's they said there are
more BMW's new and old in the U S then Europe, thus the aftermarket/repo
parts effort.

Funny, just the opposite is true in the fatherland.  At a recent BMW CCA
meeting, a member related how they recently took a trip to Germany and the
BMW factory museum was *pathetic* compared to the VW museum...

I live not to far from the BMW plant in South Carolina.
They have a museum with everything from Pre-war race cars, motorcycles,
aircraft motors to art cars. just awesome. The pride in the old cars and the
past of BMW is everywhere.Check it out at : http://bmwzentrum_dot_com/

there is also a BMW website that has a search engine to see what happened in
BMW history on a certain date, it also has gobs of info on their vintage
cars and links to other sites.
