Subject: Carb Ice-ing

Hey Y'all,
I have an engine in a 68 Karmann Ghia (sorry bus
lists, but I'll include the mandatory bus content
toward the end of this email ;^) with a 1500 SP and a
30pict2 carb.  On the carb, I turn the mixture screw
ALL the way in and it does not change the idle much,
same thing when I turn it all the way out. I just
rebuilt the carb with new gaskets, accelarator pump
diaphram, needle valve, etc. and I also dipped the
carb body over night in carb cleaner and there is no
change.  I have also noticed that in 50 degree
weather, while the car is idling, that the intake
manifold is ice-ing up just below the carb. Frost
forms on the outside of the manifold. So, I am
thinking that I have 1) A bad carb because the
adjustments make no diiference in idle speed AND
2)Blocked heat riser tubes on the manifold resulting
in the ice-ing problem...Does that sound about right
to you all?? Is there another possibility??
Now for the mandatory bus content, can I use a 30pict1
carb off of a Bus engine on the KG engine with no
problems? Both are found on 1500 SP engines.

Peace, John Baker
