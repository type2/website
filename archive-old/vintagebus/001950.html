Hey Isaiah, I know what you're talking about here.  I'm 6'2&quot; tall, 300 lbs.,
size 13 shoe.  Getting in the bus it taking it's toll on the already torn up
front seat.  I have to put my right leg in first with the toes pointed
towards the passenger side.  Then it takes me 2 hops to get me arse where it
should be.  I then draw in my left leg and shut the door.  Getting out, I
open the door, put my left foot out the door, and then grab the door and
frame (by where it latches), and kind of &quot;fall&quot; out - I guess that is the
proper term - a controlled fall.  It's quite a sight I'm sure but a small
price to pay for having a splittie. :-)
