Subject: newbie questions for a 65

This bounced back to me so sorry if it comes twice.
Hi all,
I am a newbie to splits, have had my bay for years.  I just bought my 65 21
window from the original owner.  It was originally purchased in Berlin in 65
and has been shipped across the Atlantic several times.  It mostly was used on
vacations but was stored where it was started every month.  I normally
wouldn't believe this but I bought the bus a couple weeks ago and he just told
me the following tonite.  The 72,000 miles on the odometer is original and the
engine has never been rebuilt.  Still 6 volt and all. to see a couple pics
check out http://www.geocities_dot_com/Baja/Ravine/2474/Terra.html

Compression readings this weekend were 150, 155,150,and 157.

Now for the questions.  Since the engine has never been rebuilt I am guessing
the heads have not been replaced.  Therefore they were made for regular gas.
Does this mean I have to run super?  I have gotten from the type2 list over
the years if it doesn't knock you can use a lower grade.

Second question.  If the battery ever does go dead how would you jump it?  Not
too many other 6 volters around.

The 1500 engine has a governor on it.  What would be the speed it would stop
me at if it is still hooked up and functioning?  I can get to 60 so far.

The passenger door and cargo doors can only be locked from the inside but they
both have a cylinder on the outside.  Is something wrong here?

The sunroof is hard to open on the tracks.  What would be the best thing to
lube the tracks with?

Thanks in advance
