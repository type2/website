&gt; The screw that goes through your lense and reflector should be the only

Hi Sean,
No the screws do not!  For late 1958 model on through the 1970s the screws 
pass through a rubber seal completely insulated from the bus body.  Instead 
VW designed a tiny spearpoint kind of tip on all taillight bulbholders to 
pass through a special made hole in the taillight seal and puncture through 
the paint into the metal of the body to ground each taillight.  From about 
1970 VW finally just put in a grounding wire system in all buses.  We run a 
ground wire between any pre-1970 bus taillights and onto the battery ground 
stap on the body to do this right!!!  Resulting in brighter taillights that 
do not flicker in combination with each other when signaling either way!!!!
  We installed a grounding wire system in an original 80,000 mile restored 
1958 Westie done by Charlie Hamil.  The owner was shocked to see the 
differance in signal/taillight brightness and only one signal flashing 
instead of both flickering in even the bright morning daylight.
