&gt; I originally built this engine for a bug; sold the bug-kept the engine. I
&gt; didn't like the 4.37 R&amp;P so I tried the 3.88 thinking I had the torque to
&gt; take advantage of the taller gearing at freeway speeds and 13-16 mpg is
the
&gt; result. It looks great on paper, until you actually get to experience it
&gt; first hand.  I think a well-built 2 liter with dual carbs might make a
&gt; better choice for a 'Freeway Flyer', but I'm not going there.
&gt;

I agree. Rosie ('63 Crewcab) has a 2110 with dual Weber 40IDFs, a 3.88 R&amp;P
and .82 fourth gear. She runs great, plenty of power (even uphill!) and I'm
getting about 21mpg on the highway (speeds of 70-80 mph). The taller gearing
is great, but you need the horsepower to pull it. Remember that a Westy is a
pretty heavy load and this also figures into the equation on the negative
side.
