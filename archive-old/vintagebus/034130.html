Again we get into the situation of which Mexican muffler did you get?
Mexican parts are just like German etc. there are numerous manufacturers.
Just like New VW heads, there are 2 manufacturers in Mexico and 3 in Brazil,
which one do you want? Some are junk and the others are OK and then there's
the good ones. What I am trying to do on my online catalog is represent the
product for what it is, give you the options, tell you the options and try
to direct you to the correct part, Almost every bus part listed in my
catalog has been used either by me or a local customer or friend, I do put
the cheap parts on, just to see how they install and how long they last, My
buses are driven year round and go through many product testing phases,
which helps me judge the quality and the longevity of the product, If you
are ever on the west coast look for 1 of my buses at any VW show, sometimes
2 as I will have a friend drive 1 of them for me.

&lt;&lt; I also have OEM Mexican
 bus mufflers, these are the ones used on all the 1600 loafs in Mexico,
which
 will work on all 1500/1600 split buses, and fit a lot better then the
 Brazilian. &gt;&gt;

The Mexican mufflers aren't much better than Brazilian ones.  The one I 
bought didn't come close to fitting.  I finally trashed it and bought a 
German muffler.
