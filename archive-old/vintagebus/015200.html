She's right - unbroken originals have set land speed records for
walking away - even decent-but-cracked ones have walked.

My solution for the '60 is/will be to put longer screws and a nut
on the inside.  I bought a set of the plastic repro ones to
try and reduce the chances of them getting cracked. We'll see how they
hold up...
