Hello all!
I have an original Westy roof rack complete with all it's parts 
including the original wood and metal Westfalia ID tags/labels.
It's in as close to new as an original Westy roof rack can 
get.  It's from a 63 Westy so it's got 13 wood slats not the 
earlier 15.  It was in storage in the attic of a garage since
the late 1960's.  Any idea what something like this would be worth?
