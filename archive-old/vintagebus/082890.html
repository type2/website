Subject: Friday bragging rights

Greasy volks:

I had to wait until Friday, this is a Friday topic.  Wot to do, wot to
do!  I love my bus, but muh luvly doesn't particularly.  They ain't the
most comfy thangs to climb in and out of, they are loud, smelly and cold
in the winter.  The latter is especially true for MSB, as I took the
heater boxes out and the Eberspacher isn't rebuilt yet.  So what is a
guy to do for transportation with the better half, especially in the
winter?

I have a '90 Lexus, but it has a 2.5 litre V-6 and sucks gas like a
hungry Arab:  so I gifted it to the daughter in college!  The '92
Lincoln  wasn't any better.  I just trashed that early Hummer prototype
to the hay baler yard because of a bad computer and the 3.8's propensity
to blow head gaskets. Great engineering job F*rd did on that one.  Can
you imagine, trashing a car with only 97K on it?  Yep, they only make
'em in Amerika.  

SOOOOOOO, my son Bry, who works in the afternoons at Clegg's All-Auto
here in Provo,  . . . got a line last Nov. on a '91 Tercel.  I wasn't
that interested until I saw her.  She was in very good condition
interior and exterior, just in need of a paint job and a new front
plastic bumper.  The engine wuz &quot;blown.&quot;  She has 167,000 miles on her. 
So I splurged two hunnert and bought her.  Then we got a Japanese
Exchange 30,000 mile long block for $595 and swapped her out. 
Unfortunately I had a bad dizzy and it took all month in Jan. to figure
out what the problem was, new injectors, new fuel filter, new
plugs/wires, new O2 sensor, etc., etc.  A $50 used dizzy out of Japanese
Auto Wrecking in Lehi did the trick.  

With the knu dissy emissions-wise, she passed with an Oh-2 reading of
105, with 200 being the max allowed.  I took her up to SLC for a 72 mile
rt Shunday afternoon drive to see some friends:  1.6 gals!  Then we went
down to Cedar City, south on I-15 about 250 miles.  I had two bikes
hanging out over the rear bumper and only got 30 mpg on the way down,
but with one bike on the way back, she jumped up to 37 mpg.

The ironic thing about this little gem is that she has a 1500cc, 94 hp
engine.  Lots more efficient than the flat four, but still pretty
&quot;gutless.&quot;  Even so, we went between 70 and 75 mph all the way except
through the hills at Scipio, between Beaver/Fillmore and Fillmore/Cedar
City.  Plenty peppy around town.  Oh, and she's got a 5 speed manual
gear box.

So, now I got the two cars requisite for happiness:  My Sweet Bus and
the '91 Tercel.  Couldn't be happier.  Both run like a top.  Now, which
one do I take for the spring bike rides to Moab in three weeks and 
along the Couer d'Alene Trail in late May?  

PLV,

Curt
