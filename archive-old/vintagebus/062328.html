Subject: RE: [VB] blowing hot air

With the heaters closed, extra air is vented out of the top of the heat
exchanger stove pipe through those little holes, or slots on later busses.
The hot air around the heat exchanger is dead air for the most part, venting
slower than the exiting air past the heads, but enough to get the hot air
away from the pressed on aluminum fin heat radiators inside the exchanger
tin preventing overheating in that area.

&gt; Dumb question. What is the difference between the air hoses leaking and

&gt; with correctly fitting hoses?

Wild guesses:  1.  Instead of useless air being blown where you don't
need it, when you have the &quot;heat&quot; on you are bringing air away from
the engine compartment, which contributes to cooling.

2.  You do not do this when the ambient temperatures are high, so
perhaps it is less a problem in the winter?

3.  The heat exchangers should still keep the pressure high inside
the shroud; this might not be the case with open hoses.


Again, these are only my uneducated guesses.
