As I recall earlier in this discussion, someone mentioned that if you look
at the area of open space in the side vents and compare it to the area in
the scoops, that there is no way to get as much air throught the smaller
opening of the scoop.  Made sense to me.  Having said that, I ran scoops
on my 67 Westfalia back in the 70s-80s and it ran nice.  I had two rapid
cools hanging on it and had removed the original cooler.  Always ran nice
and cool from Texas to everystate in the Rocky Mountains.  I think the gas
was better for VWs back then though.
