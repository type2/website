Subject: re; reasonable trucking

i've posted this before but will do again
SHART TRANSPORTS
1-800   556-0059
1-520    855-9734
i have used this transport company before and he is fair priced
and does a good job.
he brought a 21 window from the north  east coast to havasu, az. for
$1000.00
and the bus was also fully loaded with parts.
if it rolls he will move it, also if you have a couple of pallets of
parts he will haul it also
hard to find a trucking company like him. if you aren't in a hurry he
will give a reduced rate to fill his truck if in the area, he does a lot
of cross countries and north cal,(he was
the guy i was going to have pick up the single cab from you clara)
so write down his number and save it
