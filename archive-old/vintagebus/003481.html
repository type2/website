I had the stuck drum syndrome on the rear of my 67 bus.  Don't feel alone
Isaiah - it happens to all of us.  My last axle nut removal actually ended
up removing threads from the axle because the innards were rusted so
dag-blasted tight.

I started by removing the axle nut which really hasn't been much of a
problem for me since I invested in a 3/4 drive metric socket set from Harbor
Freight.  I just put the cheater on and jump on it.  Sometimes I jump so
hard I actually spin the tire which necessitates taking off the tire and
using bar stock on tightened lugnuts to keep the drum from spinning.  This
last time (referencing the trashed threads...) I should have stopped every
turn and cooled the nut with WD40 because you create so much heat when you
remove rusty fasteners, they start to weld themselves together and it
totally ruins the threads.  I've actually seen fasteners start coming off
and then due to the threads stripping from the &quot;welding action&quot;, they just
sit there and spin because there are no more threads to ride on.

Next I took my wheel puller pulling on a 5 to 4 lug adaptor and I totally
bent the daylights out of the adaptor so trash that idea.  I got the torch
and emptied a whole can of WD40 on the drum/axle with repetitive heat and
dousing with the WD.  Then I drilled a little hole in the drum in order to
get more of the solvent down in where it counts.  Someone suggested
PBBlaster available from NAPA and it did seem to help but no matter what, I
couldn't get the drum off.  I ended up using a 3 jaw wheel puller that
pulled right on the lugs.  You bolted the jaws to the drum and then torqued
her up.  I ended up torquing the wheel puller until I thought something was
going to break.  Next my grandfather had me take his 10 pound sledge and hit
the center shaft on the wheel puller and finally the drum started to slowly
creep off.  It finally came off a can of WD40, half a can of PBBlaster, and
2 days later.

As a little side note - Dan Kinsey just happens to have this same wheel
puller and I got the number off from it.  It's a Cornwell PU826 made in USA
brand with an extra little thing that fits on the tightener which lets you
hit it with a hammer much like an axle nut whacker.  If anyone can help me
locate this company, I need to buy 2 more jaws so I can get a good solid
pull all the way around these stuck drums I have to occasionally pull.  This
puller is made to pull drums be cause of how the jaws have holes with which
to anchor it to the drum by.
