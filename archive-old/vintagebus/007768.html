well, although it's not Friday anymore let me sound my opinion. To me, it
looks like you're setting high reserve to avoid any type of conflicts but
actually you're creating them. People bidding on your Bus not reaching the
reserve might walk away as well without explanation. You're talking about
bad bidders...... how would you want to buy anything from a seller like you?

I just had a long negotiating war with a guy selling a Bus. A few months ago
we agreed on a price, I sent in my deposit and was ready to go pick the
bus up when he called me trying to back-out of the deal. Reason? someone
told him he can get more money for it. He simply said that he's gonna send
my deposit back. After two months of waiting and calling him a few times (he
had cash problems) I finally decided to have a serious talk with him. I
simply told him that because he's keeping my deposit I'll come over and
pick-up the Bus. He didn't want to agree but when I offered him more money
he agreed. I thought that once you agree on something, especially when you
set the price it's not really &quot;nice&quot; to turn around later asking for more. I
guess that's why he never returned my money. In the meantime I sold some of
my parts I had gathered for the Bus because I was disappointed. What I'm
trying to say is that no matter how hard you try you'll always find deadbeat
sellers and buyers. If you wanted to sell your Bus right you should list it
on Type2 classified site or list it on Vintagebus auction and forget about
everything else.


My opinion though,,,,, (putting my flame suit on)

&gt; Umm, how can you complain about &quot;deadbeat&quot; bidders when you intentionally
&gt; run an auction in which you don't intend to sell the goods unless someone
&gt; bids a ridiculously high amount?  Isn't that being a &quot;deadbeat seller&quot;?
&gt;
&gt; To me, this seems to be a competition for the moral low ground with your
&gt; Georgia friend!  :)
