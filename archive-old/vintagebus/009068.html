Is that the table top one? if so thats a joke. No hookup to vaccuum out the
dust, Sand blows out of the top likes its not even attached, sand blows out
of all the seams, air attachment leaked as well. 2 tubes of silicant sealer
later, still leaks sand out of the seams..have to use it ouside with a
respirator and its still unbearable and messy..may as well have bought just
a pickup-line and a bag of sand. Never seen the sears ones, but i assume
theyre better. You get what you pay for.

&gt;I saw an ad with harbor freights $129 sand blaster on sale for $89 and was
&gt;wondering if any one on the list(s) had used them and what they thought
about
&gt;them. haven't had much luck in the past with HF air tools in the past.
