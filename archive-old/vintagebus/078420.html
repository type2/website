Subject: Re: [VB] bbbrake adjustments

Hi Tom,
Any brake job that replaces the brake shoes will if daily driven, have to be 
adjusted two or three times in the first month due to the shoes wearing into 
the circumferance of the drums.  Take two empty cans, that one just fits inside 
the other to get a visual idea of a newly installed shoe.  With the inner can 
pushed over inside they touch only in a small area.  Failure to adjust the 
new brakes and even keep adjusted old brakes results in only the edges of the 
shoes nearest the slave cylinders touching when braking!
