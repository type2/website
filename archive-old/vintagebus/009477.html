Winnipeg hey!
Did ya join the list recently?  Is your bus the white one with the pop top?
Did I meet you one night last fall in front of the court house?  Did you
tell me once that you got the body of your bus done in Brandon?  Did you
ever meet the guy off of route 90 with the green or torqois bus? Should have
a Winnipeg type II chapter of NEATO!
