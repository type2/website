&gt; hey all...
&gt; got a wild hair up my bottom today and decided to pull my motor and
&gt; replace the pushrod tubes/seals as they were making a nasty oil leak...
&gt;
&gt; thought i'd write a litle something about it just in case anyone
&gt; cares...

I feel your pain Isaiah,
Last night I reinstalled the rear crossmember, tonight I'll be reinstalling
the bumper and then my weekend engine pull will be history. I had to pull
the engine and then loosen the bolts that hold the transmission in place in
order to install my new shift coupler. No amount of wiggling, prying,
grinding, greasing or cussing would grant me enough clearance to slide the
new coupler in between those two rods.
Finally I realized that I had spend more time trying to fix it without
pulling the engine than an engine pull would normally take.  The frustration
level was rising pretty quickly too. On Saturday morning I just came to the
realization that pulling the engine would be the only way out of this.
Once the engine was out and the transmission was loose, it took two minutes
to fit and secure the new coupler. I had to resist the normal urges to
replace half a dozen different things once the engine was out, putting those
things off until winter and until I have a few dollars for maintenance.
The engine is in, no unusual problems were encountered, except that I
crimped the throttle cable and had to loosen the engine bolts a second time
to free the cable.
I even drove the bumperless bus to work this morning as a preliminary test
before taking it to Crystal Lake for the Anderson Show this weekend.
I guess I learned a pretty good lesson in all of this; don't waste time
trying to do things the easy way. Thanks again for your help on the roadside
a couple of weeks ago.
John Flowers
