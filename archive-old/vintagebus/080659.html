Subject: Rear overhead A/C unit

OK, not in a great hurry to find one, but I thought I'd get the word out in
case someone finds one over the coming swap-meet season. Does anyone know
where I can get an rear overhead A/C unit? Apparently, my
former-California-Sundial had one and I'd like to replace it, just for
aesthetics, really. I have become accustomed to driving without A/C, but the
lines are still back there and the wood headliner doesn't cover that
section, so I'd like to replace the A/C instead of the wood.

If you see one, get the seller's contact info and let me know, please.

Thanks!!!
Chris
