Very true Kyle. I too saw the bus and it truly wasn't as bad as some of the
people out here must be imagining. Someone has mentioned pride in their
bus, well if Brian doesn't have pride, then I don't know who does.
As Ronnie pointed out, he did what he had to do when he was on the road.
And speaking of the road, this wasn't a rush-hour freeway. On my way home
in the middle of the day I don't think I passed more than 20 cars until I
got closer to civilization, at which time he would have been home.
I'm sure people are burning out on this thread, but I wanted to voice a
vote that it wasn't the travesty that many listees think it was.
