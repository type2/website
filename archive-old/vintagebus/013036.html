Everett,

I was wondering that myself while sitting on the couch memorizing my wiring diagrams.  I thought that maybe it was a diameter in mm or something, but that still didn't add up completely.  I would love to know the origins of those numbers as well.  For now I know how thick a tail light wire and brake light wire are so I just compare to those.  

You mention buying wire at the store.  You aren't going to do the whole harness in red wire like the PO of every bus I have ever bought, are you?  I was thinking of doing Roberts panel in all dove blue wiring.  Wouldn't that be a snazzy car show eye catcher and a pain for any future owner.  Actually, I just rebuilt the original harness with the original color of wire and it looks great and works great.

Richard
