Mike,

You wrote:

&gt; Who has changed compression by using shims under cylinders?  Any
&gt; problems with this method later? I have been told that the shims can
&gt; &quot;burn out&quot;

I have shims at the base of each of my cylinders to lower 
compression. Don't know what thickness they are. From memory they 
appear to be a tad under 1/8&quot;.

The shims have been in place for around 10,000 miles and no problem 
so far. This is in a type I engine with 90.5 barrels (1776).

Maybe the 'burn out' was for rings located between the barrels and 
the heads, if that was ever done. 

&gt; Who has changed compression by removing metal from the top of the
&gt; pistons? Problms?
&gt; 

Not had any experience of this. Personally, I would need a bit of 
convincing to go this way. Sort of doesn't seem right to be skimming 
the tops off pistons.



Ian
