Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for Show Single Cab, what is it going to cost?

Hiya SCVW,

The man you want to see is Lenny Copp at West Coast Classics in Fullerton, 
California.  Check out his website at http://www.classicvws_dot_com/index1.htm  
He can produce exactly what you are looking for.....a perfect, brand new, 
right off the assembly line, ready for any show, Single Cab.  The man is 
meticulous in his perfection of detail.  I've been to his shop and it's like 
walking back in to 1957, or 1951, or 1970, or.........well, you get the idea. 
 
Hope your wife is OK with you spending $20,000 to $30,000, because that's 
what they're going for.
