Subject: RE: [VB] Wheel Straightening advice

Well, I decided to bite the bullet and head over to Mag Masters. I dropped 
two of them off last week and should be getting them this Tuesday or 
Wednesday. $130 for the pair is good compared to what I've heard about 
Sprintstars, etc., so I'm not going to complain. :)

&gt;You might try Stockton Wheel (also in CA)... search on Google_dot_com for their
&gt;number.
&gt;
&gt;FWIW, I had some og empi two piece GT five spoke wheels welded and polished
&gt;by mag masters... they did a great job but didn't clean the back sides of
&gt;the wheels as I ask them (twice I asked actually both in writing and
&gt;verbally)... go figure.  You can see their work on my page:
&gt;http://www.dsquared-dev_dot_com/davem/wheels.htm
&gt;
&gt;If I recall, six wheels ran me right around $500.
