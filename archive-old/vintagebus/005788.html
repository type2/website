We used to have at least one MB diesel car towed into the dealership a week
that had a full tank of gasoline....
18-19 gallons of gas and a gallon of diesel. I had a Fiat 128SL that I would
put this 'dieseline' in. Most of the time the car ran ok except: very hard
to start cold, no acceleration cold, and smoke. Once my car wouldn't even
run around the block. The last time I put a tank in, car ran fine for almost
the whole tank. Then I drove down the freeway and smoke came out everywhere!
I pulled over and it looked like the car was on fire. When I opened the
hood, engine oil was coming out of every opening. The oil level was above
the cylinder head/cam and coming out the oil cap. What happened: diesel
won't burn in a gas engine. It just pushed past the rings and filled the
crankcase, raising the oil level. Needless to say, I no longer use
'dieseline' no matter how clear the gas looks.
