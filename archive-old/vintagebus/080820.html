Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Noise with Load (fwd)

I'm posting this to the list in case anyone has any further comments or
suggestions. Gary and I have been discussing this issue privately
off-list...

Gary,

Due to the fact that the tranny has never shown any signs of leakage, I
neglected to check the oil level for two years - the tranny has always
appeared bone dry everywhere. When the noise first started in 2002, I was
on my way from Florida to NY on the I-95, when it first began, though
there were brief strange knocking noises whenever I would deaccelarate on
the offramp for refueling, after three hour stretches of driving on the
way east from CA to FL on that trip.

When I arrived in LI, NY, I ripped
into every area of the rear end, trying to find a cause for the
intermittent knocking. All bolts were tight, tranny mounts were new,
tranny bolts tight, no cracks or damage to body or frame. I disassembled
both torsion bars and spring plates looking for problems. Finally, out of
desparation, I checked the oil level - there were 35 oz missing, out of 85
oz capacity. I filled it up, and since I needed to drive back to CA, I
just left and did it - April 03. There were no further noises on the trip
back. The noises started again in April 2004, on 45 mile trips from San
Jose (Cupertino) up to San Francisco. At exactly the 31 mile point on the
way up to SF, the knocking would start. The first time, I pulled off the
road and just sat there for ten minutes.

When I recalled that neither
engine nor shifting had been affected during the knocking, I decided to
continue on, at a lower speed. The knocking stayed in the background
intermittently for the rest of the trip, never as loud as at first. I did
the trip back down to San Jose at 47 mph with no problems. I repeated the
trip two more times with exactly the same results in the coming months.
When I moved up here to SF last month, I drove it at 45 all the way, so it
would make it. There were no noises on that trip. I've driven it around
town many times on local errands, to keep the engine running and the
battery charged and there are no unusual symptoms, the engine has full
response and power and the tranny shifts fine and quiet, nothing unusual,
no noise in idle, no apparent rumbling bearings, etc. It's a huge mystery
and quite unnerving for me.

I've always gone first class on the bus to try and avoid situations
like this, but this one's got me tied up. Plus, I'm not working right now,
or for the next long while, and so one thousand dollars plus just to see
if the tranny might be bad is just plain crazy. If I have the thing
overhauled and there isn't anything wrong, then I don't know what else to
do - this noise thing started coming on several years ago, very rarely and
just for a couple seconds, but now, the thing is downright scary once it
starts. I'm tempted to get it going, and let it go til something breaks -
at least then it should be obvious what the problem was. There are no
obvious cracks in the frame or any welds, and I think the tires and wheels
are not candidates, as the tires are low mileage, and the rims havent been
stressed. It'd be great if I could find an experienced VW bus freak in the
area who'd listen to it, but there aren't any people on the list here in
SF. A couple guys in San Jose, but they aren't VW experts. Someone like
Veewee would be really useful right now. My engine dude lives down in
SoCal, too far to bring up here just to listen.

The oil light and pressure are normal in any condition - engine's
apparently running well. There's still that funny 'ringing' sound at
around 2000 rpms that has been there since last year, but the engine's got
tons of power and compression, and the valves, plugs and endplay are
spot-on. Doesn't seem to overheat either. Really strange, and I can't go
anywhere outside the city with it like this. just the trip up from San
Jose last month when I moved up here was hair-raising. I did 45 mph in the
right lane all the way (50 mi) up here. The noise starts at or above 55,
after about 30 miles of highway travel. It drives around town just fine,
but that's all just short errands. SF is a small town.

Yeah, it's frustrating, and this is the first time in 32 years I can't
diagnose a bus problem.
