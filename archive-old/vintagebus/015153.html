Can't speak from experience but, it sounds like there could be something to 
it. I can't speak for the combustion chemistry but any time you are 
increasing power you sacrifice something. The hydroboost thing is a perfect 
example you may get more power when the gas is realeased but the energy 
consumed makeing the gases is more than what you gained in power. In essence 
you are storing energy at a less than 100%efficiency and releasing it all at 
once for more power.

Moral of the story... you may be able with this fan to get short bursts of 
power at little cost because the time when it's not &quot;boosting&quot; offsets the 
lost energy. Using it for continuous power increase, however, could only 
pull down the efficiency of the engine.

I know &quot;serious answer for a half serious question&quot; but honestly when do I 
really get to show what all the long nights in College have taught me.

One of the gadgets is what he described as an 'electric supercharger'. The 
concept looked pretty simple. It consisted of some sort of spacey looking 
steel fan housing plumbed into the air inlet where the air cleaner would 
normally go. The air cleaner was a special one that fitted between the 'fan' 
and inlet manifold/throttle body.

He claimed that the installation of this device had resuled in a noticeable
increase in power delivery(it has not yet been dyno'd though). He also
explained that when it was switched off normal low pressure airflow was 
resumed through some kind of bypass arrangement.

Now for the question. Is this something like that kooky 
'hydroboost'thingwhere the electrical energy needed to convert water to 
hydrogen and oxygen exceeds the extra engine  power output gained by 
plumbing the gas into the inlet?
OR
Does it sound like there might be something to it?
It would be nice to flip a switch and cruise up those steep hills like 
afreight train.
