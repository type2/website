&lt;&lt;Hey, if there is one thing the rustybus is, it would be safe.  The brakes 
work awsome (just asked the guy that nearly rear ended me the other day when 
I stopped) and except for the recent sticking clutch from last weekend the 
clutch has never given me a lick of problems.  And which of your buses has 3 
point lap/shoulder belts in it?  Well?

And the amazingly safe and well maintained rustybus
