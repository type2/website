Subject: Quick intro...

I confess...I have been lurking for months.

Now I will be polite and Introduce myself.

I am in Reno, Nevada.

I have had Busses since high school.  Starting with a '66 Baja Westy in  '88
and then a very clean '67 21 Window (with custom camper) in '89.

I sold all when I got married in '92 (Wife loved busses, just needed
different vehicle). 

Recently ran across some deals I &quot;couldn't pass up&quot;.  Now I have a '60 23
window, 63 SC, 64 SC, '70 deluxe.  All of those years w/o a bus seem to have
piled up and caused some kind of psychotic backlash whereby I now have 4
bussed one of which runs.  I am in heaven!

Now seems to the time to post a retroactive &quot;thanks&quot; to all for great bus
content in the last few months.

End intro.
