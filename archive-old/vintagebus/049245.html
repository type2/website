My junkyard '66 camper, probably a RoadRunner, has 3 wheels with 10 holes in the &quot;outtie&quot; part of the rim. Bug wheels? I put a pic up on www.vintagebus_dot_com under Various Parts Pictures, or do a search on &quot;wheels&quot;. 

Went out Sat. to harvest some wheel wells with the 3rd harbor freight cordless sawzall. Firsthad a bad battery charger, the third stopped after a few seconds of cutting. #4 cut many feet of nose and hinges, no problem until I get 3 inches into a nice wheel well. Then it stopped. Full battery,blade moves by hand, nomotor.I'm looking for a small generator to power an AC saw now. 

Congratulations on the SC find, Thom. It's amazing to find any VW trucks inCh*vy and F*rd country. My suggestion? Keep it rough and use it as a parts hauler. In dove blue, you'll be incognito for sure. Four tail lights? Doesn't the West Coast Metric single cab have dual early tail lights?
