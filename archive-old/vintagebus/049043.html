In light of the evidence posted, and the apocraphal stories not posted, all accidents are close to home. That's where we do the most driving. When we and the opposition are in unfamiliar territory, we pay attention to the Usual Nonsense going on.  Yeah, it's the usual drive to-work-listen-to-the-local-morningjerks, or it's We're Driving To Our Vacation Destination! Which has the adrenilin? Which has the rewards of lower risks? Yep... get on the road and go.
