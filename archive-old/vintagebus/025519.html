Chuck,
We really should come up with a name, though. The Bus Pilot Asociation
in Boise ( I am a far-living member) probably doesn't want the
confusion...

How Bout &quot;Bus Drivers Safety Net&quot;
or 
&quot;Hippy Gas Fund&quot;
or 
&quot;Three Cylinders and a Prayer&quot;
or
&quot;Aircooled Interstate Rescue Squadron&quot; AIRS
hey , thats a good one, we could have t-shirts that say 
&quot;When you put it in the road, your puttin' on AIRS&quot;

Hell, I think we could have more fun naming the thing than actually
helping out any broke down bus drivers.
