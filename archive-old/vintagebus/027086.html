Subject: re: 1776 w/ oilbath

NQ,

My oil bath only has one horn. It came from a '67 Dormobile (which would
have had a 1500 SP, pict 30 carb). Even though I'm still using a 34
carb, I figure with the added displacement, I should be pulling more air
thru it. That's why I asked...

Fisher Buggies drilled the jets on this carb specifically for this
engine. They are as follows: 

Idle .010 over (.020)
Pump .010 over (.030)
Main .005 over (.055)
