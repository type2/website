&gt; Had to do this at the VW Classic last year. The old generator
&gt; seized a
&gt; bearing while we were in line to get in. Removed belt and ran engine
&gt; only to
&gt; move. After we got in our parts swap area Ronnie went around and
&gt; found a new
&gt; generator and I asked afew people if they had ever removed the gen.
&gt; with the
&gt; motor in, one guy had and gave me some ideas. Had the old one out in
&gt; 30 mins
&gt; and new one in in another 30 mins. Motor was a 1600 duel port
&gt; doghouse.
&gt; Heres the steps:
&gt; 
&gt;  Disconnect the battery and generator wires
&gt;  Remove air cleaner
&gt;  Remove carb, intake man, end castings

If it's still connected, disconnect the thermostat below the right
cylinders.  Remove the rear portion of the tin under the cylinders to
expose the thermostat.  Unscrew the bolt holding the bellows to the
bracket, and unscrew the bellows from the pushrod.

You also have to remove the screw from the &quot;Hoover bit&quot; on the front
side of the shroud (if it is present, feel on the back of the doghouse)
and you will probably have to remove the two air duct pieces that lead
to the front tin.

If you've done this once, you'll learn to replace the cheese head
screws on the ends of the fan shroud and on the Hoover bit with
hex-head bolts. 

&gt;  Raise Cooling shroud and support with screwdrivers
&gt;  Remove generator stand
&gt;  Remove Generator
&gt;  Install in reverse order

When I did this on my '71 quite a long time ago, I don't remember
having to remove the manifold or generator stand.  This may be because
of differences between the buses or my faulty memory.
