You have a bad sending unit. Only fix is to remove the tank and replace it. I
tried to stop it on my 66, but it was futile. And no, replacing the gauge will
not help.

&gt; Just got my bus on the road in the last couple of weeks after being stored
&gt; in the garage for the winter. Great to be driving it again!!
&gt;
&gt; However, the needle of the gas gauge will read properly one minute and now
&gt; bounce back and forth for 30 seconds at a time. Is it the ground wire?? Sign
&gt; of gauge failure???........... It is not related to bumps in the road and
&gt; had been working properly the last five years......
