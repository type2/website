Subject: Master Cylinder math - very geeky

I'm glad this master cylinder thread came up. I did the conversion a couple of years ago to the 72 cylinder on my bus and noticed that the pedal effort was higher. It isn't enough to bother me too much, but my wife doesn't like it at all. I think I'll probably switch to the '67 cylinder because I want her to be able to stop the bus in a hurry if she needs to. The dual circuits won't help me at all if the bus doesn't stop in time.

As far as the percent difference in effort. Now that the diameters have been posted by Eric and Barb, we can figure that out. If you don't like geeky math stuff just hit delete now. 8^)

Since all we want to do is compare the two cylinders, we don't need to know how much pressure it takes to stop the bus. The cylinder just makes a certain number of pounds/square inch. More square inches means more pounds required for the same braking power. 100 pounds per 1 sq inch is the same as 200 pounds per 2 sq inch and the same as 400 pounds per 4 sq inch. The square inches are the square inches of cross section area of the master cylinder. The equation for the area is pi times the radius squared or
pi times the diameter squared divided by 4, (same thing). Since the area is determined by the square of the radius or diameter, small changes in diameter make large changes in area and therefore in the pedal effort.

Let's just do the math before this gets any worse:

67 &amp; earlier: 22.2 mm dia.  22.2^2*pi/4 = 387.08 mm^2
72 &amp; later: 23.81 mm dia.  23.81^2*pi/4 = 445.25 mm^2

percent increase from stock effort:
(445.25-387.08)/387.08*100 = 15 percent

That seems about right to me using my uncalibrated leg. I probably do have to push about 15 percent harder on the brakes to get the bus stopped.

Hope you enjoyed geeking out with me.
