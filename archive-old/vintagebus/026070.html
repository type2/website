&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I went through the archives and found a lot of information that said it
&gt; was good to get its value appraised, but I only found one recommendation
&gt; in Arizona.  Has anyone else had there baby appraised in AZ by a VW
&gt; friendly soul?  Any recommendations would be great.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

What part of the world are you in?
Around my area, there are two shops that will do an appraisal for you:
L-5 Vee Dub in Salem, Oregon, and Always Vee Dub in Portland. 
L-5 does it free for customers, but his appraisal is a bit on the loose
side. Ashley at Always VW is Portland charges $50 and does a very
thorough job, with professinal looking results. He also claims to have
some certified qualifications in auto appraisal (cant remember the
details), and is certainly qualified in vw, having run his shop for 20
or so years. 

Phone numbers an or addresses supplied via p-mail to teh interested.

I would check with local vw shops.

Uncle Jerry Jess does it as well, in Phoenix. Another very qualified
individual who could certainly provide anyone on figures for comperable
vehicle sales numbers if any cheap-skate insurance company wanted to rip
you off....
