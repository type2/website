Subject: RE: [VB] Forged or not

The quality of the cast CW cranks or the welded CW cranks are good enough to
outlast a rebuild for a daily driver. If you were building a street machine
with occasional trips into the 7000rpm are I'd say, sure, spend the extra
bucks on forgings, crank and piston. But if you want a good running
dependable daily driver, go with the cast and welded CW cranks. IMHO

In my opinion, If you are planning on building a motor
spend what you can on quality parts and skimp on
nothing that is absolutely necessary. That said, go
for the forged crank and pistons. It would be shame to
build a cheaper motor and get little use out of rather
than spending a little more and getting a great
reliable motor. The difference in building a cheap
stocker and a quality one isn't too bad. I did the
quality one and have over 40k trouble free miles.
 I have a 1600 SP in my '65 Westfalia. It's has a
stock cam, counterweighted crank and is fully
balanced. 30 pic carb, 010, solid shafts with swivel
feet adjusters in a dual relief case that is cooled by
a stock 71 doghouse cooler and I added a 1.5 quart
sump. It is all I have ever needed and I have no
complaints! OK it's not fast but so what,it's a bus
and i'm slowly putting together parts for a 1776 or
1700!
