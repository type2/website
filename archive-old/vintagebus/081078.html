Subject: Wolfsburg West Truck Corners

I picked up an unused set of replacement truck corners at the swap 
meet in Ennis this past weekend. They are Wolfsburg West and I got 
them for CHEAP!!!

Anyway, holding them up to my '59 truck I'm seeing they're not right 
in shape. I guess there were different corner shapes? And these fit 
later trucks?

Anyone have experience with them?
