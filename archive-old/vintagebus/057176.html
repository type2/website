Subject: RE: [VB] Grrr,  Westfakia!

I know where the confusion comes from. Cause it is
factory two tone and the fact that it does not have
the jealousy windows, right? Early westy's got regular
popouts, and some westy's were made out of standards,
not just kombis.

&gt; I am not familiar with this bus personally so who
&gt; knows its life story...
&gt; But in its present form I feel that it is a stretch
&gt; to call it a Westi.
&gt; 
&gt; The rant is actually a generalization from what I
&gt; have been seeing
&gt; advertised lately.  I have nothing for or against
&gt; the example bus.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A little rant here.  If your bus is not a REAL
&gt; Westfalia then do not claim
&gt; &gt; it to be one.  This ad is so darn wrong about even
&gt; coming close to being a
&gt; &gt; real westfalia it is not even funny.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ...you'll have to explain this one to me.  What
&gt; exactly about this
&gt; submarine hatch Westy isnt a Westy?  True enough it
&gt; doesnt have any real
&gt; views of the camper interior...but judging from the
&gt; roof and the view in
&gt; the rear hatch of the cabinets, I'd at least assume
&gt; it has westy parts on
&gt; it...
&gt; 
&gt; Or do you know something more about this particular
&gt; bus that we dont, that
&gt; isnt explained in the ad?
