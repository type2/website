So some unknown reason, I had lunch at a Rubio's Baja Grill (aka a
fish taco place) a while back and got a large drink.  These come in
plastic reusable cups and advertise a particular soft drink vendor.
The artwork features a hammock suspended from the backs of two
vehicles: one his a generic 4x4, and the other bears a striking
resemblance to a splittie.  Admittedly, some artistic license was
taken (and probably should be suspended), but that's the only way I
can interpret the windows, top-half-only rear hatch, and bumper
shape.  Still haven't figured out what look like horizontal air vents
where the engine lid should be, though....
