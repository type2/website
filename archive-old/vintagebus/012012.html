Subject: Drip Edge Rust/Automotive painting
Mime-Version: 1.0

I am trying to contain some minor rust on my bus, The bus has it's original paint job, which is in relatively good condition.  
On the drip there is some rust beginning to occur, for some reason the water doesn't seem to flow out of there smoothly.  And now that there is some rust, the bumps in the paint are keeping it from draining properly.

I am wary of painting, for a few reasons:I have seen too many bad paint jobs, I can't afford to repaint the whole bus(and have it done well) although I am not sure how much it would cost, I imagine it to be very expensive, the bus currently has more than a few dents and dings.  

Instead of painting the whole bus I am thinking of just scraping the drip edge down with one of those toothbrush wire brushes, and then a couple coats of corroless, then a top coat of a color complementary to the whole bus(which is pearl white), basicalle creatign a stripe around the top of the bus.

PS:Any one know where to get pearl white paint. I recently scraped the front floorboards downdown and put two coats of corroless, and am thinking of painting over these with some pearl whit, or perhaps a different complementery color.

Any reccomedations on auto paint manufacturers.

Thanks for answers to any of the above.
