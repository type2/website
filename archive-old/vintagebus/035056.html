 Last night was the local Peachstate Transporters bus club meeting.  I rode
 with my buddy who has a '71 bay westi with a 1600 with 30PICT-3 carb and 009
 dizzy.  It ran like crap!  I built the motor for him so I know it is good,
 but that stinking 009 was killing him.  I think it makes a huge difference
 in drivability to add a vacuum dizzy.  That stock dizzy will make the motor
 'feel' like 10 more HP.  Okay the motor is a hack because he did not spring$
 for many new parts, but it is still strong...  Not my best work but it runs.
 Hey Bob, I did fart in the bus a couple times too ;)  LOL
 
 Also on temps run a VDO gauge and see what you are running before spending
 the time on an external cooler.  Here are the general Porsche numbers (356,
 914, and 911):
 176-210 running cool
 220 Normal 
 230 Warm
 240 Hot
 250 Too Hot
  &gt;&gt;
but this is not a porsche....   But you are saying that 220 is normal? in a 
upright ACVW- I though oil degrades about 225-230.  In fact I've seen a 
difference in consistancy after it's run that hot.     I thought 176-210 was 
ideal, if it was below that after it had warmed up it would be too cool.
