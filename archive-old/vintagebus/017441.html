I'm new here, as I just got my bus two weeks ago (67
21-window) although I had a 66 bug in the 80's, and
the deluxe is my comeback.

Anyway, there was a guy at the long Beach SOTO show
two weeks ago selling one of these original end
kick-panels, and he had a bunch of repro trims (the
ribbed aluminum part) milled based on the original. I
don't remember what he wanted for the orig. but I
remember thinking it was a lot.

I was going to ask everyone what they thought of ebay,
whether it's a value or not. I live in Southern
California, so I guess I'm in a pretty good area for
swap parts and stuff. 

I've bought and sold collectibles on ebay for three
years, my take is this: It only takes 2 people to make
something sell for an outrageous price: the high
bidder, and bidder #2. If two people want something
bad enough you're going to pay for it. I've learned
through experience if you wait long enough, you will
find that thing again (on ebay or somewhere else),
usually for less. 
So, if you have the dough and are impatient, ebay is
for you. The rare parts are the ones that always go
through the roof. (i.e. this end panel will beat the
pants off a decent used pop-out latch any day,
relatively speaking).
I guess ebay is good for the folks in rural areas.

Have I said anything anyone doesn't already know? If
not, sorry. I guess I was just wondering if anyone
thinks ebay is a good place to shop for old stuff, I
saw a washer bottle going for $80 and thought that was
a lot.
