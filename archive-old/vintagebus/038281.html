I exprimented with my cracked cap(I have a new spare luckily) and was able
to get it to seal and function perfectly well. I soaked the craked cap in
glycerine for a day or so and then wiped it clean with spirits. I turned it
upside down and poured in some casting latex and then pushed in a bottle cap
that was a loose fit. The  bottle cap displaced the latex so that it made a
skin about 2mm thick inside the cap. It works fine but I have never fitted
the thing due to the space it takes up.

BTW a friend of mine did a lot of latex casting and he said that a complete
latex replacement would not be impossible to make.
