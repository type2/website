i just had a weird thing happen to me today.i took yurtle out today for a 
short cruise to put some gas in it and run it.and when i was returning i got 
a strong smell of gas.so i shut the bus down and pulled of the road,open the 
engine lid.and the fuel line came out of the carb. i am talking about the 
lil brass looking line that your rubber line hoos up to.i pused it back into 
the carb and it seemed to pop back in.is this a common problem on a 34 pict 
3 carb?and if so is there a way to stop it without changing the carb?thanx 
for anyhelp i dont need to be driving a fire bomb with my to lil ones with 
me.

thanx
mike(64 11 window walk thru)aka yurtle
