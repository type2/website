    I'll add here that it is *very* important to get it cut &amp; aligned properly.
The '66 Westy I hacked was done in a bad way (my fault)... and turned out to be
a big headache... hack begetting hack and so on.
    Luckily I had enough spare shifter stuff to get it roadworthy again...
    Even then I have to wonder if it has the right hockey stick in it. It was
exhibiting some of the same symptoms as Ellis's bus, less after a little
geometry-tweaking.
    Scat makes a little weld-on thingy that lets you adjust the length of the
shift rod and the angle between the socket up front and the set screw dimple in
the back... I have never used one of them, though... would require tranny
removal I think, to get all aligned properly for the weld.
    I am thinking of a shift-by-wire system... sensor box under the shifter,
different signals for each gear, built-in interlock system, 'lectric servo box
on nosecone... hm. something for the MEs to chew on. For the right price it
would eliminate the shift geometry problems of most vws, as well as the
midengine apps and so on... and it'd sell, too...

ah well... happy monday.

&gt;  If you don't have the luxury of a free fix like Ellis here is a easy cheap
&gt; way that will only take about 15 mins. to fix and no pulling the eng. and
&gt; trans.  With trans in neutral, and shifter removed, cut shift rod about 15&quot;
&gt; behind shifter socket and twist shift rod left and right until you find its
&gt; middle of play, then have a friend hold the shifter socket from above in the
&gt; center of the hole in floor pan and weld shift rod back together. If you
&gt; have ever shortened or lengthened a buggy shifter this is the same way they
&gt; are done. I did this on the Binz and after many thousands of miles it is
&gt; still shifting great, so says Ross the new owner. Any ??? email me.
