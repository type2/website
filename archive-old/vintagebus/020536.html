Subject: Very short trip report
To: vintagebus &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hi All  Zeopole L ,has checked out but I am
staying....Short trip report...Sleeping with Ol'No
Name...Took the bus to the beach just to spend the
night.Parked on a short curved jetty at Port
beach.Well the cops chased me out there.It was getting
dark and the generator light was starting to flicker
on at low rmp's(my engine is pulling overtime before
she kisses me goodbye..low compression) so I was
running without headlights...it was not that dark
yet...The local sheriff was trolling around me at
Avila beach then followed me to Port...then passed me
off to the Highway Patrol who in turn passed me to the
Harbor Patrol....None of them got close enough to take
a bite out of me.They just sat over there and waited
for me to pull out.Guess what...I'm staying the night
...dont need any headlights in the a.m.....so that set
me back 20 bucks for camping there...better than a
ticket(or accident).Not a bad spot...the dolphins came
by...within 30 feet of me to say Hi! and all the other
little jetty critters nibbled on my toes looking for
something to eat.It was nice to put Ol'No Name to use
as a roof over my head and a safe haven for this old
man to rest.And &quot;No Name&quot; started in the a.m. and got
me home....I've got to be better to that old
bus...What a great Buddy when ya need one.
