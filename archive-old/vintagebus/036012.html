&lt;&lt; Hi Volks,
 As some of you out there know VW had a spare tire gas can for the type 1 
(15&quot; 
 and 16&quot; sized cans.) and another for the type 2.  Of the type 2 spare tire 
 gas can one fit the 14&quot; and another for the 15&quot;.  One of these also fit in 
 the Thing spare tire.  Because of the differant shape of the type 2 rims of 
 14&quot; and 15&quot; the type 1 spare tire gas cans will not fit.
   Last month a member of our local VW bus club (Cascade Kombis) brought out 
 for show and tell a brand new bus spare tire gas can he had just gotten from 
 Europe through a certain auction site (To remain nameless here!) for $180.00 
 plus shipping.  Unfortunitly this club member had seemed to think he had 
 bought a NOS VW part.  Not so!  The original type 2 spare tire gas can had a 
 VW with circle around it about 2&quot; diameter embossed in the face of the can 
 that is visable when it is installed in the spare tire.  This new tank has 
 all the original markings, but no VW symbol.  Upon close inspection we could 
 tell where the VW symbol was originally on the stamping forms and had been 
 ground off leaving a blank flat round area on these new tanks.  So please 
 keep in mind that these apparently are being remade.  While these new ones 
 are still a great item to have, do not to pay top dollar.  Most likely the 
 market will be flooded soon with these.   Eric&amp;Barb

I have seen the vw stamped ones and the ones without the stamping for years. 
Prolly like hazet tool kits, some stamped, some not.
  Mike
