&lt;&lt; i think i am going to stick with the empi muffler, just because this bus 
will be a camping/road tripping vehicle and it will probably be in those 
higher rpm's quite a bit.&gt;&gt;
Just expect to replace/rebuild the engine alot sooner!  Probably about every 
30,000 miles average.  Plus getting MPG figures lower than 20.  Which means 
lots of $ down the tank over the miles.
 
&lt;&lt; as far as the carbs go, i have knowledge and experience with single carbs. 
i don't really consider myself a newbie anymore. i already bought them when i 
bought the motor, so i think i'll stick with them. i don't know much about 
dual carb setup, but that's kind of why i bought them. so i could learn more 
about them. plus, i have all you wonderful people to help me with any 
questions along the way. i also have a guy
 locally helping me out. so i figure, i'm young. i might as well  learn while 
i still can.&gt;&gt;
Sounds good!  Hopefully you will keep learning even when you are old and 
gray!  We still are learning something new all the time about VWs. :)
 
&lt;&lt;now, i think the rods and heads are already balanced because it's a new 
engine. i may be wrong, but i hope they are.&gt;&gt;
Calling a factory engine balanced is a little like someone near and dear to 
you telling you that they are just a little pregnant!  
Wieght differance between connecting rods new 5 grams, when repairing 10 
grams.
The same as above for pistons!  This means you could have the heaviest rod 
and piston opposite from the lightest set.  Adding up to 10 grams differance. 
 On a tire an ounce ends up being 20 Lbs. at highway speeds.  Then the 
stocker crank is pounds (max. 12 cmg = 10.4 in. Lbs.) out of balance and due 
to this wants to turn itself into a &quot;U&quot; at high RPMs.  Which in turn vibrates 
the engine and shifts the engine case web over #2 main bearing eventually 
causing a space to be made between the case halfs and lowering of oil 
pressure at this bearing and the two rod bearing at either side.
  i don't really have to clean anything. it's never been used!&gt;&gt;
Make sure to take a good look at the head fins.  Our new Brazilian heads had 
about 50% of them clogged up with casting flash from the factory!  Think that 
would have been good for cooling?

&lt;&lt; i am getting the bigger fan shroud.  and i thought about a c/w crankshaft, 
but that might but something i do later on down the road. and a tach?  who 
needs a tach? &gt;&gt;
Anybody who runs a bus does for just a fifteen minute drive!  So far we only 
know of one person (Clara) who seems to be able to sense when thier bus is 
doing 3,000 RPM in third and especially fourth gear!  Our panel came with a 
tranny that would not allow the engine to push the bus over 45 MPH.  Turned 
out that fourth hit 3,000 RPM at 35 MPH!  Which is probably why the DP engine 
that came with the bus in the cargo bay had a hole in the top of it that one 
could reach into.  It was probably doing 5,500 at 55 MPH.  Eric&amp;Barb
