Hi List,

I have a 1961 Kombi and a 1966 Deluxe that I am looking to trade.  These are 
both project vehicles, but restorable.  Both are almost complete!   I am 
looking for a complete running split window bus (any model) that is solid 
and runs good.  I had my heart set on restoring both the 61 and 66 but have 
not been able to (too many projects around the house!).

If anyone is interested in a possible trade for these 2 vehicles for a 
running solid split please let me know.  I am going to be taking digital 
pictures this weekend and will be able to send them to you next week.

Anyway, I live in Michigan about 35 minutes from Flint.

Please let me know if you are interested or have any questions.
Thanks,
Michael Lynch
