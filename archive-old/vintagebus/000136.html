Hi Jon &amp; Steven,
First always make sure that your clutch disc is thicker than 7mm, using a 
open ended wrench to measure.  Definitely &quot;Brakleen&quot; by CRC in an areosol can 
does the degresing job.  Just put down some newpapers to catch the drippings, 
and suspend the disc/brake shoes in a way to prevent your skin from getting 
in contact with this chemical, and outside for fresh air for your lungs.  A 
little goes a long way.  If you get it on you it strips out your skin oil, 
and soon after the skin peels off painfully!  Cost for two cans of this is 
about $6.00 at costco.   Eric&amp;Barb
