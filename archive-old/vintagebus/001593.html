For the body purpose, do you think using Por-15 Tie Coat is a better way to
prime the body than an epoxy primer ??

Can we say that a good resto project that implies long lasting rust-free
body and nice lookin paint job could be to:

-use Por-15 rust preventive for the underbody and frame;
-use Por-15 TieCoat as primer for the body part then apply the (whatever)
paint

??

If you can afford it, I would try the Tie-Coat stuff.  I used the Dupont
Prime-n-Seal, and although I have yet to test it on the road for
durability,
I have two comments.  That stuff is NASTY!  You MUST wear supplied air
while
using it, it seems to be concentrated evil.  Also, you have to spray
your
topcoat within 12 hours of spraying the primer/sealer, else you've got
to
scuff it before topcoating.  That can be an issue, but not too bad of
one.

I am a sucker for good advertizing, and if the Tie-Coat/POR-15
combination
is as tough as they say it is, (or even half), then I would go with
that...You'd &quot;never&quot; have to go below your topcoat to refinish or
repair!
&quot;Impervious to rust&quot; and all that....

Speaking of rust, anyone got an opinion on whether to use &quot;One Step&quot; or
Rust
Mort in rockers, doglegs, gates, etc. to kill and prevent more rust?
I'm
gonna get one of those wands to squirt the stuff in with....&quot;One Step&quot;
is
about $100/gallon.....

&gt; Has anyone used the POR-15 Tie-Coat primer and would like to comment
on
his
&gt; or her experience?  I have primed the bottom and some of the inside of
my
&gt; project with silver POR-15, and there is no way I can sand all the
knooks
and
&gt; crannies for topcoating.  This Tie-coat primer is supposed to go over
POR-15
&gt; without sanding, and I was wondering if folks have had success with
it.  I
&gt; noticed it was polyurethane isocyanate (which is good in my book), but
it
is
&gt; single component, so I am warry.  I plan to topcoat with Glasurit 22
line.
&gt;
&gt; Here is the info on the Tie-Coat primer:
&gt; http://www.por15_dot_com/faqs/faqtieco.html
&gt;
&gt; My Dupont supplier recommends Dupont Prime 'N Seal 2600/2700 to do the
same
&gt; thing (stick without sanding the substrate).  This is a non-sanding
&gt; primer-sealer which does not require sanding before topcoating.
