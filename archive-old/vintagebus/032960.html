this is one topic of debate that I have not found any documentation on exact 
dates.    

For quite a while I was under the impression that 59 through 65 had slanted 
front and rear, the 66/67s had pointy front and rear.

Then I heard a rumour that 65s had pointy rears and slanty fronts.  

More of these rumours passed around, and also anecdotes from people who had 
slanty front and back on their very original 65s

As rear bumpers are often subject to change after the original purchase, this 
is hard to document the truth of.    When I found the 54 combi  I used to 
own, it had a primer 56-58 front bumper on it that was in primo condition.   
Looks like the PO had gone to VW and bought a new bumper someday, and put it 
on w/o paniting it.   I guess the stampd bumpers would have come primer 
because they were painted to match the bus, but wouldn't a new  sturdy bumper 
come painted as they all tended to be that Silver White?   So how would you 
know.   We switched that bumper for one from a 58 that was the correct dove 
blue/white, looked nicer as it matched, but it may confuse someone down the 
line who may think it was the original bumper, when the mid 56 and earlier 
bumpers are slightly different than the late 56-58 ones.   

ONe day, however,  I did find a picture of a westy in official VW literature 
that had pointy rear and slanty front.  So at least some buses came that way 
new.

Perhap, however, early 65s were slanty front and rear, then the later 65s got 
points in the back, and in 66 they went to pointy both bumpers.  This is the 
theory I am favoring currently.   

My 65 westy sports the front bumper it came to me with, which I believe to be 
original because of the tent bracket on it.  It had no rear bumper, I found a 
$15 ugly bumper  (slanty) at a local junkyard, then  after it became a 
painted shiny bus and people kept giving me crap about the ugly bumpers, I 
found a really nice pointy rear bumper, and put that on the westy, and the 
ugly slanty rear  (with cut outs for bug muffler)got rattle canned white and 
put on the 59 truck, which had a 40hp with a bug muffler on it.   Whether or 
not the point or slant came on my 65 I do not know, but I put a nice bumper 
on there, except it came off a deluxe and has holes for the trim.  SO, it has 
a pointy rear and a slanty front.
