 &gt; that sounds like a great idea. does the vapor barrier go between the body

I'd do it anyway, and tuck the bottom o fthe plastic into the doors. this 
makes the water drips through the door out the bottom of the door

other wise the water runs down the inside of the panel, and drips between the 
panel and th bottom of the door , into the cab.
