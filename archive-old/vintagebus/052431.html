Subject: Re: [VB] side pop outs needed

Hello,
I've had good results with Dave Palmer's Creative Engineering repop Pop-out
frames.  I also got my Safari Window kit from him, and it's far superior to any
kits out there on the market.  Any of Dave's Safari or Pop-out parts are
interchangeable with the originals.  I bought mine direct from Dave's shop in
England, but I believe that Ronnie _at_ Oldvolks carries a lot of Creative
Engineering stuff.

It goes without saying that the original part is always best.  I can't tell you
how many original Pop-out frames I went through, just trying to find some that I
could get those #$*&amp;_at_$# tiny little screws out of.  They must have automatically
rusted the minute the Bus was driven off the showroom floor.  Short of NOS, I vote
for Creative Engineering stuff.  You can log on to Dave's website at
www.creative-engineering_dot_com.

Good luck,
Edr

&gt; Unless they threw away the jigs they had and started from scratch,
&gt; the repop popouts are nowhere near as good as the originals.  I'd
&gt; bought a pair for my '55, and found that no two corners had the
&gt; same radius, and none had the same radius as the original.  They'll
&gt; work only because the popouts are not a tight fit into the window
&gt; opening.

&gt; &gt; As for your question, you can buy new, virgin popout frames from Wolfgang
&gt; &gt; International.  I have bought a few from them myself, and they are every bit
&gt; &gt; as good as the originals.
