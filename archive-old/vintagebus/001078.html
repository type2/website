I've had the same problem with forgetting how to put that plate under the
shifter back in, resulting in the same things you're describing. It takes a
little visualizing how things work up there, from above and below, but once
it's in right, you'll know it!

&gt; the shifting was way messed up... smooth as silk but hard to find gears,
&gt; and they seemed awfully close together, and the reverse lockout wasnt
&gt; working.  I may have installed that silly plate under the shifter
&gt; backwards, but i dont think so.  It works, but you have to know the bus
&gt; and where the gears are or you wouldnt be able to drive it too well..
&gt;
&gt; Trying to go into first it feels like you are hitting a brick wall, but if
&gt; you go halfway between where first and fourth should be, there is first...
&gt;
&gt; Trying to grab second you'll get reverse unless you aim right. Im hoping i
&gt; didnt bend something trying to unstick that front coupler with my big ass
&gt; hammer...
