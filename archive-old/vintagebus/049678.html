Subject: Re: [VB] kick panel templates

&gt;would anyone be willing to tape together some paper and trace their kick
&gt;panels, then fold it up and send it to me?

A few years back, a Listee sent me some of these plans (volksnut, you
wanted a 'local paper or some such' as payment... wouldn't insult you w/
the local excuse for a paper, but I hope I remembered to send you
SOMETHING).

Is there a way to scan these and put them online in our docs project?
I'm not sure if they make a scanner that big, or how to make them so they
get to your computer in an accurate way, but if Thom, Matt et al will tell
me what to do and how, I'll get crackin'.
