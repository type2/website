&gt; Steve, the thin wrenches are called &quot;tappet&quot; wrenches as that was their
&gt; original purpose.  Don't know if Craftsman sells them, but I'll bet Mac
&gt; Tools or Snap On would.  I go with Mac if I can't find it a Sears, Mac has
&gt; great quality, but you won't pay Snap On prices.

How about an obstruction wrench to get at the back carburator nut on type
1 engines?  Anyone find a good one?

I'm currently using a flanged nut with a 12mm hex from a Honda
motorcycle, but it is still tough to remove.
