Subject: RE: [VB] Dual circuit upgrade

  That's what I always felt. But by the time you buy the Brazilian 72 and
later master, the conversion spacer and a proportion valve, you'd be close
to the cost of a 67 master anyway.

Ronnie    all statements are for the amusement of those that read it, just
my opinion.

I guess it's time to go to my friends shop and have them calculate the
different pressures and how they come on. They do this on the off road cars
and have the formulas needed to do this. Again, it will take HARD numbers to
end the mystery, not just I did this, you did this, he did this theory.

On another note, the later master conversion was dreamed up as a replacement
for the then UNAVAILABLE 67 only master (thus using the 72 and later so the
reservoir would fit) and not as a duel circuit replacement for any bus, it
just progressed that way.

  On another, another note. When I did my friends 64 deluxe, we tried many
different masters on it trying to find a safe alternative to the 67 only.
This included 3 different type 1 masters. A 64 Porsche master and the 72 and
later bus, we even installed the antilock piston kits and proportioning
valves to try to get good smooth even braking. Our test track consisted of
hauling ass up and down the alley behind my shop and locking up the brakes.
This how we discovered what really happens. The antilock pistons did work
with the 72 master but had a slight spongy feeling in a panic. The 68 and up
bug worked but no matter how we adjusted and bleed the brakes the pedal was
real soft and with the antilock kit would go to the floor. After a few days
of doing this we installed a 67 only master ($250.00 dollars NOS) at that
time and had all braking problems solved.

Wouldn't a proportioning valve be required to balance the brakes
correctly with a different MC?

Tried the bug conversion and it works but makes for a real spongy pedal.
The best bet in my OPINION is to step up and buy the 67 master. CORRECT
part for a early bus. I am still not sold on putting a disc brake master
on a drum brake car. It doesn't work on dune buggys or bajas, so I still
can't figure out how it can work properly on a 4 drum brakle bus. On the
buggys it locks up the front brakes prematurely. The reason it doesn't
on the bus is probaly due to the weight, but what happens in a panic
stop on a slick road?

ronnie   just my opinion

my life is worth $175.00 dollars

Thanks for the info.  What about using a 19.0mm Bug MC?  Should give
increased pressure at the brake pads?

&gt;
&gt; &gt; According to the RMMW catalog, admittedly not as accurate as Bently
etc.,
&gt; &gt; the 50-67(66?) bus MC has a 22.2mm bore.  Both the 211 611 021Q for
'68-'69
&gt; &gt; bus and the 211 611 021J for a '70 bus also have a 22.2mm bore and
&gt; &gt; are non-servo units.  Has anyone tried either of these?  The local
&gt; &gt; shop
doesn't
&gt; &gt; carry these in stock so I could not physically compare to see if the

&gt; &gt; mounting is the same.  If someone could look at them and let me know
which
&gt; &gt; looks to be the best match I would be willing to try it out and
&gt; &gt; report.
&gt;
&gt; You cannot use the 68-70 masters because you cannot get a reservoir
&gt; with a screw cap to fit them. The two holes are farther apart then the

&gt; 67 and 72+ masters. 68-70 is [if memory serves me] 100mm. All the
&gt; others, including
VW,
&gt; Mercedes, Volvo, are 85mm center-to-center.
&gt; Unless you used the upper reservoir, tube, and lower reservoir from 68

&gt; [one-year-only set-up] or 69/70.....
