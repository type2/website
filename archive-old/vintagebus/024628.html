Hi Kevin.  The screw should be up on the stairs of the thingy when it's
cold.  As the dealy on the brown boxlike dweeb warms up, the stairs on
the thingy trun around until the screw on the whatsit rests on the
halfmoon object.  The idle should then be at 'normal'.  Open the lid
when the whole deal's cold, manually blip the thingy a couple times to
simulate giving it gas before starting.  Start 'er up.  You should have
a high idle again, that slows as she warms up.
