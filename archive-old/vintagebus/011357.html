&gt;  Rather than perpetual motion, I'd like to cite the law of
&quot;Conservation of
&gt; Energy&quot; . . . 
&gt; 
&gt;  The only energy being applied to the shaft is the torque wrench 
&gt; that reads say 50 ft-lbs . .
&gt; 
&gt; So if there is any angular deflection, it has to be using some of that
&gt; 50 ft-lb as energy . . . 
&gt; 
&gt; Since you can't get more than you put in, less than 50 ft-lb will 
&gt; reach the nut . . .

Ahh, now I see the confusion!  I go round this one with my students
every year!

The difficulty is mistaking ft-lb of torque for ft-lb of work (energy).
Despite having the same unit, they are not the same thing!

In work, the force is applied parallel to the direction of motion, so
if you apply force F pounds and move an object X feet you will do FX
foot-pounds of work.  In this situation, the object has to move to
have work done on it.

In torque, the force is applied perpendicular to the lever arm.  If
you apply force F pounds to a lever arm of L feet you will create a
torque of FL foot-pounds.  Note that motion is not needed in this
situation and no work need be done.  Torque is therefore the
rotational analog of linear force.

In a static (non-moving) situation, the torque on one end of a shaft
has to be equal and opposite to the torque on the other end of the
shaft, regardless of the spring effect of the shaft.
  
You can prove this to yourself by taking any sort of shaft and
attempting to apply a torque to one end without a corresponding torque
on the other.  In any case, the shaft will start to rotate.  If
someone holds the other end of the shaft, they will feel the torque
you apply, as long as you apply it slowly as you would with a torque
wrench.

The situation where you use an impact wrench with an extension is not
static, as the torque is being rapidly applied and released.  In this
case, the spring effect of the extension is important and will reduce
the available torque.  Essentially, the angular range through which
the impact wrench can apply a torque is limited, and if the extension
twists it can absorb the angular motion of the wrench before it is
transferred to the fastener.

Ok, now I'm going to get a beer and let my brain cool off....  :)
