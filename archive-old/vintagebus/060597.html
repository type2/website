Hi Bob,
Since heads were and are made interchangeable from side to side of the engine 
this tin in the fins of the heads are slotted in all 1,2, &amp; 3 heads.  Yes, it 
appears to make the cooling air flow go through the lower fins of the heads 
and missing them would cause hot spots on the lower part of the heads akin to 
missing the deflector tins under the cylinders.
