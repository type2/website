&lt;&lt; My rear wheel brake bleeder valve is sheared off. Any recommendations? Can 
I just use an easy out and replace the valve or is it gonna have to be 
machined out. Can I still bleed the rest of the system and adjust the 
spindles on them all.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Virge,
Never ever use an easy out in a fastener that has been broken off due to 
being corroded in!  Easy outs are hardened so when you break one off there is 
no way to drill it out of the way!  Instead you have to spend hours of time 
grinding away on one with dental bits you have begged/bought off your local 
dentist.
  The places to use an Easy out is where the fastener has been sheared off, 
and the remaining piece inside the hole can be moved.  Even then it is wise 
to only use an Easy out after you drilled all the way through the piece of 
fastener, and can get to the other end of the fastener with a hammer, and 
punch.  That way if you break off the Easy out you can reach around to punch 
out the broken piece of Easy out.
   As to your problem, and other times one runs into broken off, frozen 
fasteners you need to just have to drill out the piece.  Since in your case 
there is a centered hole drilled in already you can just drill it to the 
proper tap size.  If it had not drilled centered hole you would center punch, 
and then drill a small hole.  Then work up in drill sizes till the hole is 
just a size below the tap size.  If it ends up out of center then you can use 
the center punch to hammer over, and collapse the cresent shaped piece of 
steel in there.  If you are good (Or Lucky!), and get it centered you can go 
to the correct drill size, and tap out the remains.  When using a tap to 
remove the pieces of the fastener, and make sure to remove the tap often to 
metal chips out or the tap can easily get broken off in there.  A steel nail 
with a strong magnet works well to attract the chips out!  If you do break 
off a tap, and you were smart to use a good HSS (High Speed Steel) tap you 
can shatter it into removable pieces with a hammer, and punch like a piece of 
candy cane!     Eric&amp;Barb
