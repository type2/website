Subject: Re: [VB] VW Authorized Dealership Inspection

  This is not a bus but what happened to me and taking someone to court.
 
  I had the air fixed (ha ha) in my wifes van, it lasted 2 days, took it back and they fixed it again, lasted 2 more days, took it back the 3rd time and they fixed it again, lasted less then 4 hours.
 
  Threatened a court action unless they either fixed it properly or refunded my money. Their answer was we have allready lost as much money as you so O'Well
 
  I then sold the van (to a friend/mechanic) who fixed the air with a 10 dollar part in 5 minutes!!!!!
 
  I was really pissed as this whole air thing had cost me over 3000 dollars over 3 years and my wife still didn't have good A/C till I bought her a new car!!!
 
  I proceeded to take the last repair shop to court, never did the judge ask if I had it repaired anywhere else, if I even still had it or anything else.
 
  All the judge cared about was if I had given them the chance to fix it (which I did) and that I refused to take it back to them again. The judge did ask them if I brought it back would they fix it. They said yes and I said no.
 
 After 10 minutes of thought the judge ordered them to refund ALL of monies paid. They proceeded to write me a check on the spot (which bounced the first time threw the bank)
 
  The burden of proof is on you and generally you will only recieve money paid to them back and NOTHING for your time and/or other shops looking at it.
 
  Don't waste your time and energy getting quotes, just go after what you paid and then take it to a compentent shop and have it fixed right
