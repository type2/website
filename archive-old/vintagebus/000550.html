 Yesterday I yoinked the gas tank out of the 66 and did the old chain on a
 wire trick.  I'm sure I pissed off a few neighbors with my wild thrashing of
 the tank and the loud noise it produced.  Anyway, after a few blasts with
 the powerwasher inside and out, I felt I had the tank cleaned out well
 enough that I wouldn't be sucking mouse turds into my carbs.
 
 By day's end, I worked it over with the wire wheel in the drill and
 slathered on a liberal amount of POR15.  It wasn't until I sat on the john
 and started reading some chioce vw mags from months gone by, that I
 realized, &quot;Hey, I don't have a sending unit.&quot;  I've got a fuel guage in the
 dash but why don't I have a hole in the top of the tank?  Was this an option
 in 66?  I wonder if I can do the modification and add a sending unit because
 I'll be damned if I'm going to drive around blindly with no idea what my
 fuel level is.  I thought maybe I would have a reserve tap somewhere if
 someone adapted an earlier tank but I don't even have this.  Nothing more
 than a tank, fuel filling tube, cap, and a spiggot to let the fuel out.
 
 What gives?  What can I do?  (seriously)  Have any of you encountered this
 on an old bus tank before?  Is this aftermarket b.s.?  If I can add a
 sender, is there anyone out there who would like to sell me a 67 sending
 unit and guage?  Thanks again for the help!

it is likely someone retrofitted a tank from a 61 or earlier, which would not 
have had a guage/sender.   even if you have a sender, you may stilljoin the 
ranks of those who don't have a working guage.      new senders are 
available, i think about 37.50   don't know why I think that.   new stock 
guages are not availble asaik, though vdo does make a guage that fits in the 
dash, but different face.
