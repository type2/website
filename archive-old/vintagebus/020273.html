Well, let's see if I can get this into some sort of lucid order:

--Many AOL subscribers report that they are not getting all the list
messages, in fact AOL seems to be losing a significant fraction of the
mail. We've done extensive checking on this and we're certain the
messages are disappearing after they are accepted for delivery by AOL.
If this is a problem that vexes you, you can read all the list mail from
the web reflector. But:

--The web reflector has been down along with the rest of the type2_dot_com
web site for several days. Right now we're parked on this guy's DSL
connection while we raise funds to get back into the real server farm.
Nobody quite knows why it's broken, it's upstream from us, believe me
we're working on it as best we can. There is a cobbled-together
workaround-- the reflectors can be accessed here:

	http://www.type2_dot_com:60/~type2reflect/
	http://www.type2_dot_com:60/~splittyreflect/
	
--Please give money. This whole gig has been an unreliable mess ever
since we had to pull it out of digital-galaxy. It's like camping out on
your aunt's Hide-a-Bed in her living room. We need to go home.
