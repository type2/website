This is so location-specific, it's painful.  Call the city's &quot;building
permits&quot; or &quot;building inspection&quot; department and ask.  They're usually
pretty good about giving advice, if you go down with some plans (at
least that's been the case whenever I've done anything along those
lines).

:  * What's the best way to attach it to the sideof the house?

That'd depend a lot on what the house looks like there, if you want
the roofs connected, and stuff like that.

:  * Anyone done this before, and can offer suggestions?

For starters, make sure your landlord goes along with the idea....

Get a copy of your local building code.  This is probably some version
of the Universal Building Code, with local modifications.  The
inspection people mentioned above can tell you where to get the local
version.

Having said all that, I'm afraid I have to point out that this is only
very vaguely on topic for this list....
