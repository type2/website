Subject: RE: [VB] Turn signal switch part 2

My switch on my 67 SC was loose as a goose also. The black cloth tape did
the trick for me too. I had just replaced the 9-pin turn signal box with
Matts circuit and then the return clicker started binding first in one
direction and then in the other. Sometimes I would have left turn signals,
then other times only right. It can be VERY danderous using both hands to
get your turn signal lever up or down. Also, my hi-beam part of the switch
went bad. Looking for another 67 switch, anyone have one for sale?

I had the same problem, although not as extreme. My switch had a *bit*
of play in it, which I was able to take up with some tape. I used black
2&quot; cloth tape and it blends with both the switch housing and the column.

Well, I've got my switch rebuilt and looking nice...we'll see how well
it operates.  My next question is, how does it clamp to the steering
column, is the a bushing of some kind that goes between the switch and
the column? When I screw both halves together around the steering
column, it's too big to stay up, it just flops down to the brace.  What
gives?
