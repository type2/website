Subject: Texas Trip and missing sub-hatch camper
To: Bus List &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

I just got back from a trip to Texas for the Amarillo
VW club's tour to Palo Duro Canyon.  Drove my '61
Flipseat Westy w/ singlewheel trailer, and had a good
time.  It's a very pretty canyon (second in area to
the Grand Canyon, I'm told).  My travelmate was Angela
Stell (the prettiest MC of southwestern shows at
Busses and Balloons every year
(onearth_dot_com/2001show)).  She won Best-of-Show with
her 1969 Bug.

All of which is beside the point.  After pulling some
cactus spines out of Angela's derriere early today, we
went off in search of a reported sub-hatch camper in
eastern New Mexico, and found where it had been in San
Jon (on I-40) where it had broken down and was for
sale.  However, it was gone!  Damn!!  If anyone has a
lead or info on this bus, I will trade you the info on
a '66 Standard we also found today!  Only missed it by
a week!

Thanks for any help.
