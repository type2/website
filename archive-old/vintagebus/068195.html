Subject: Re: [VB] Can you tell from the pics?

You're right, they are round. Looked kind of square to me at first but I stand corrected. I saw the mirror too but couldn't make it out though it looked lower than the one in my '70. I think I should have went to an ophthalmologist rather than the parts store!
