&quot;He wants the elusive car show dee-lucks kit. MX code 1002....&quot;

all i've got to say is DONT DO IT!  ITS NOT WORTH IT!  I bought my bus in
running, driving, ugly but solid condition.  I immediately dove in to the
&quot;show quality&quot; restoration.  I have spent a bit over 10,000 and have never had
the opportunity to drive my bus in the 2 years I have owned it.  I would have
to say that I TOTALLY MISSED THE POINT.  MX Code 1002 is one to avoid.

regretful and indebtful,
dan
