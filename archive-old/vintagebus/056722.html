Subject: opening semaphores

--part1_13f.d408644.29f73c2b_boundary

I need to open my semaphores on my 59 so I can change the bulbs to 12 volt. 
Is there a way to open them?  I have tried pulling them up, they come to a 
point and then get stiff and I don't want to force them open.  I got some 
advice from a good list member, but the wise man gets wiser by asking more 
questions...
