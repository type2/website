Hi Jon,
Went down and saw my buddy today to show him how nice it looked when clean
and he said that it actually came that way back in the early seventies and
to his knowledge you could only get them like that for a vw bus.  Steven
Howell says he saw one in a bug in the seventies.  By the way not a speck
of chrome on it.  Thanks anyway.

Erik
