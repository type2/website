Subject: Pressed bumper and brackets

I just picked up a pressed bumper and  brackets (no splash pans)
as part of trade. I don't need either and I have a guy that wants
to buy just the brackets. I'm wondering if I should sell them
together (bumper and brackets) or separate. Does anyone on the
list need just a bumper? What's a fair price to ask for the
brackets? bumper?

Thanks,
Greg
