&gt;you can check this easily at idle, since the ONLY varable 
&gt;then is when you move the timing pickup from #1 wire to #3- 
&gt;and see the retard easily.  Oddly, I've seen this retard built 

You're right.  I didn't think that one through properly.  The retard is
on the lobe, not the advance mechanism so it would be just as obvious at
idle or even statically.
