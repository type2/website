Eric &amp; Barb -

Removing the beam to do this operation seems like too much work!  I had my
buddy replace the swing lever shaft bushing w./ the beam in the car.  I did
not perform the operation, but I did watch.  Seems like it required pulling
the swing lever, and SL_Shaft.  Drive out the old bushings.  Make a puller
out of all-thread to pull the first of the new bushings threw the orifice.
Reset the puller, and pull the second of the bushings. Get your reamer, and
ream away.  Reassemble.

This is done, of course with the bus on jack stands.

Linkage stays intact, and the operation takes under an hour. - K

&gt;&gt;Certainly not!  All you have to do is jack up the front of the bus.
Remove
&gt;&gt;the flex brake lines and then unbolt the front end from the body.  This
will
&gt;&gt;allow the front beam to suddenly to drop down and bend the heck out of the
&gt;&gt;front shift linkage, and in turn allow the beam to be slid sideways to be
&gt;&gt;worked on.  Of course doing this will require you to repair or replace the
&gt;&gt;front linkage......
