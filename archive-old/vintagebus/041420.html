&gt; That is, if you use an external cooler, to have a thermostat X in it.  

I have a t-stat on one of my buses with a 72 plate cooler on it.  The
maker of the thermostat (perma-cool) states that there is always some flow
through the cooler though to prevent air gaps etc.  It may make sense to
just put a loop on the cooler side of the thermostat in the winter.  I
haven't checked it out yet.  Mine kicks in at 180 degrees F.  It seems to
be holding the temps down to 205 or so, but the engine is big and burning
rich and still breaking in. Running a bug transmission I'm afraid.  Maybe
I'll buy some Chevy adapters and cut the wheelwells and put some truck
tires on.:) 

&gt; about these things,   though I haven't seen anyone post their oil temps who 
&gt; lives and drives in the SW desert.  
My 58 runs 230-235 sometimes out in the heat.  This is a dual port, 7:1 CR
with either the splitcase tranny or the new 3.88 small nut.  Readings are
taken by pulling over, running around back and sticking a thermocouple
down the dipstick tube.  Reading from Fluke digital thermometer.  Oh, it
has doghouse and large crank pulley.  I've been thinking of getting one of
those Porsche fan pulleys.
