well,

I wont go off on the whole need thing again... but if you are looking for
a 59+ truck bumper they are one year only... (60 and up had a regular bus
bumper) But 68-71 bay bumpers and splittie bumpers have the same profile i
think, you could weld your ends onto a more readily available bay bumper
center.

If you need a stamped one, good luck to you.

take care.
