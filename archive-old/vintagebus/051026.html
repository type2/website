  The problem you might encounter is clearance on the second pipe unless
your valance has been cut for pee shooters allready. The same reason a zoom
tube won't fit

Ya I don't think any exaust peice should be attatched to the bumper. This
idea is based on custom tail pipes only. I don't think they'll even be long
enough to need to be braced.

&gt; Hmm, my original muffler on my truck has one clamp around the tailpipe
&gt; extension and it bolts to the bumper bracket at the body. If you look at
the
&gt; breakdown of the parts for the transporter muffler it will show that
&gt; bracket. Nowhere did I say anything clamped to the bumper, just exteded
out
&gt; to the end of the bumper so the exaust was diverted away from the vehicle.
&gt; Look in your Bently manual. Or there is a picture at busdepot_dot_com

&gt;
&gt; Hate to bother you guys because I missed out on part of this thread.
What's
&gt; this about support straps to the bumper?  Sounds like a problem.  The
bumper
&gt; doesn't vibrate in sync with the engine, therefore, something is going to
&gt; eventually shear.
&gt;
&gt; The stock bus muffler has a support bracket that connects the tail pipe to
&gt; the end of the muffler expansion chamber.  The bugpack has a strap that
&gt; clamps the muffler body to the header I think.  I've never seen anything
&gt; that clamps the muffler to the bumper that lasts for long.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;Support straps against vibration and extension to at least the end of the
&gt; &gt;bumper. If it works, I'll order a set.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I've decided to attempt to have custom exaust tips fashioned for my stock
&gt; &gt;bug muffler. Each tip will be ported off to each side. I think that a
stock
&gt; &gt;bus muffler will have too much back pressure for my 1641cc. Two reasons:
&gt; (1)
&gt; &gt;only one tailpipe as opposed to two, increasing back pressure (2) the
stock
&gt; &gt;bus tip narrows at the end, causing even more back pressure. Anyone have
&gt; any
&gt; &gt;thoughts on this idea?

&gt; &gt;&gt; just spend the 100 bucks and get a real complete bus exhaust from bus
&gt; &gt;&gt; depot. ive run all sorts and there is really nothing as good in a bus
as
&gt; &gt;&gt; the real thing.
