Subject: RE:re;lower compression, main jets, transport

Ronnie and The List,

FWIW: I don't claim to be the foremost expert on engine building, but
what I've read and discussed with builders leads me to beleive that
shimming the bottom to increase deck height is a better strategy. There
is much less pressure in the crankase than in the cylinder, so it seems
logical that you would want to minimize the mating surfaces in the head.

I do retorque my engine occasionally (never methodically) and have
gotten from 20k to 85k miles on my engines, but I'm still learning how
to do them right. I've built 3 from the ground up (2 of these are still
going), 2 I've had the bottom end built for me... these failed with the
fewest miles. BTW: all my engines have spent all or part of their life
in Type2s... and I drive 'em hard!

I also don't think 7000 miles is enough to judge an engine... good or
bad. 5 or 10 times that number will be a better indicator of what worked
and what didn't. 

Mebbe' I'm right, mebbe' not, I'll learn more soon. I need to build 2
more engines in the near future- stock 1600 SP or DP for the commuter
Bug and something big for the '65 Bus... was going for 1776cc Type1, but
Barb &amp; Eric have me thinking about Type4 upright :}

Hope this is useful dribble and not just regular dribble.

&gt; 1,  when i build a motor and find that my compression is to high, or not
&gt; enough deck height, i install copper cylinder head gaskets instead of
&gt; shimming under the barrels,
&gt; 1 i find that i won't have oil leaks under cylinders due to having an
&gt; extra surface to seal, 2 i find that the heads have less of a chance of
&gt; coming loose due to hot and cold
&gt; variations.and what ever else causes that. my JEROME motor has over 7000
&gt; trouble
&gt; free miles on it even after driving to JEROME and back with an oil temp
-SNIP TO END-
