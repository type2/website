&gt;As with most of the single choke Dells and Solex carbs I've had, they
&gt;suffer from the same thing, vacuum leak at the float bowl. This occurs
&gt;after a year or more when the float bowl gasket starts drying out and
&gt;becoming hard. While yet soft, the gasket fills the imperfections.

Is there any kind of goo that can be put on the gasket or used in place
of the gasket to fix this?  Or is it too difficult to get a layer of
goo that will seal without also being too thick?  Also, the sealant
would mean that you would probably trash the gasket if you took it
apart, which might cause problems for roadside fixing.  I'm pretty sure
that the stock Solex air horn gaskets go on dry.

The DPO's solution to this problem on my car was to crank the air horn
screws down harder, eventually warping it.  When assembled with no
gasket, I could get an .006&quot; feeler gauge in the gap.  I lapped it down
to better than .002&quot; with a piece of glass and some valve grinding
compound.

&gt;The Solex carbs are not to bad to rework, there isn't anything sticking
&gt;up around the mating surfaces.

On my Solex/Bocar 30 PICT 1, there was some stuff sticking up but it
was all removable - accelerator pump discharge tube, a little brass
jet with a check ball under it, etc.
