&lt;&lt; why do you folks bolt the side step on? theft?
 
 I won't mention where my bus is, but my side step is just held on with with
 something like a hitch pin...I used stainless steel, but they rusted pretty
 quickly, but they are still fairly easy to take on and off.
  &gt;&gt;
mine came with two brackets that hold it on. basically a piece of flat metal 
with a pin welded on it. pin goes through hole driled in bottom of jack point 
in to the step and then a screw through the bracket into the jack point to 
hold it all together.
