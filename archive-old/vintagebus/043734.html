Subject: Re: [VB] (early?) double cab rear seat hold down

&gt;Well, off line, I've been talking with Steve Harris (62 DC) and John Yost
&gt;(two 65 DCs).  It seems that John's 65 double cabs have no hold downs on 
&gt;the floor for the rear seat pedestal.  Steve's 62 has both.  My 59 has
&gt;the mounts for the carriage bolt head on the floor.  Anyone else care to
&gt;add to this discussion as per what year it might have changed?

Per the online '67 parts manual, the seat bench (thing you sit on) 
changed part numbers at 1 270 003 in 3/64, as did the reinforcement
(I think it's at the top rear of the pedestal; see the diagram).  The
pedestal itself just has one part number listed, 265 801 903 C, but
with the 'C' there may have been three previous versions, superseded
to the C version when that parts manual was printed.  Links are...

I hope this helps!
