O K, I got the big ol' 1914 all smoothed out, got the 3.88 gears. Now that I
have enough power to handle it, I would like to go to a tire taller, but not
wider than the 165 R 15's. This is on the 63 double cab.
I saw one at the Springfield show with 205's. Too wide, couldn't get your
finger between the tire &amp; the wheel well. When the body goes up &amp; the wheel
comes down and does its toe in thing, I know there will be no clearance.
