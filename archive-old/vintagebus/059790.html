Subject: Re: [VB] chicago area vw shops

Can't recommend anyone that I know off but you might have some luck if you get in touch with the guy
that has a shop on Pulaski in Chicago..... between Addison and Irving on the north side of the
street. He knows his ACVW's. Also there is a shop on Milwaukee Ave. just south of Belmont but I have
never dealt with these guys.

Other than that.... see what others have to say.

| Hi everyone,
|     Does anyone have a lead on a vw shop in the area?  I've checked out
| several  body shops and &quot;supposed&quot; vw shops and they are confused as to what
| a 57 singlecab even looks like. I've heard more than 1 time that vw did not
| make them, but what do you expect from a cut and weld insurance is our best
| customer shop!  I have everything ready to go for reassembly but just need
| someone with the body skills to put the pieces in the &quot;correct&quot; places so I
| can add the parts and get it on the road before winter.
|                                                                  Steve 57
