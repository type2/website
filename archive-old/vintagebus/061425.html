Subject: Re: [VB] VIN Woes

Sweet jesus on toast, could they be any dumber?  There are a LOT of cars
running around that were made before the VIN was standardized in what, '83?

I thought CA was bad, but they look like rocket scientists compared to CO.
Actually, with the state of the economy, they probably *were* rocket scientists.
A guy I worked with who did unix support had a masters in aeronautical engineering...

&gt; When I was getting my plates here in CO for my 66 Samba which was purchased 
&gt; in CA with a HI title, I had a hell of a time getting even a temporary tag 
&gt; because 1) the VIN did not have enough digits, and the DMV computer would 
&gt; not accept it, 2) the previous title in HI said the bus was white and 
&gt; purple, and the DMV person thought the purple was really more of a dark 
&gt; blue, and that I was therefore trying to commit some sort of fraud.  These 
&gt; &quot;discrepencies&quot; kept me in a legal loop for about two months.
