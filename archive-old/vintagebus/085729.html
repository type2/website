Subject: More google map fun

If you put &quot;N Cornelia Ave &amp; W Normal Ave, Fresno, CA 93722&quot; in www.maps.google_dot_com you'll find one of the largest collections of ACVW's in Fresno. It's the third lot north east of the Cornelia &amp; Normal intersection, Dennis Sullivan's place. He isn't on the list, but you might have seen his chopped black split bug at shows in this area.
