&gt; My bus would rip in two before this thing broke.  It mounts to the same

&gt; receiver is attached.

Hi Tim,
More than likely you will have a chunk of your bus rip off from that hitch.  
The area you have it bolted to is only sheet metal and will soon fatigue from 
pulling that kind of load.  You really need to U-bolt the hitch to the rear 
torsion bar tubes to have enough strength!!!
