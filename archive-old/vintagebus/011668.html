Hey all,

One of the coolest things I run into while maintaining the &quot;Reference
Library&quot; at www.type2_dot_com, is when people send me  images.   My favorite is
old Vw Camper brochures.  

Recently,       fellow listee, George De La Rosa, sent me some scans out of
a UK printed magazine (circa 1962) with articles concerning a few camper
conversion companies of the time.  Many of them were not Vw but look very
similar.  Some of the Vw converters include Devon and Dormobile.  I have
posted the pages on the Dormo at: 
http://ourworld_dot_compuserve_dot_com/homepages/JJRodgers1/dormobile.html and will
get the Devon stuff up soon.

All of the online brochures for Vw converted campers are listed at:
http://ourworld_dot_compuserve_dot_com/homepages/jjrodgers1/library/camper.htm
Please take a look at the ones I have found and if you know of any others
or have some at home that you would like to share with us....let me know!

PS:  If anyone is interested in the entire article to see how the Vw vans
compared to simalar UK vehicles of the time, pmail me for a ZIP of the
images.
