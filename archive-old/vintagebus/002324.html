Subject: oil pressure switch
Date: Sat, 4 Nov 2000 14:36:44 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

My oil light on my '70 bus w/1600 dp isn't coming on.  I removed the wire &amp;
touched it to the case and the light came on.  Ahhh, the oil pressure
switch.  The FLAPS has the Mexican Hella version which seems quite a bit
cheesier (and lighter) than the German Bosch one I took out.  I installed
the new one &amp; it didn't work either.  So the questions I pose, (before I
drive down to the FLAPS to get another Mexican Hella) Are these Mexican ones
inferior? and/or is it odd for a new one out of the box not to work? and/or
is there something I'm missing here?

Thanks for your help!
