Actually, that is where I tried to get mine mixed up.  They said that they didn't have the formula but the said that there was some new water based (?) paint coming out and they would be able to mix that up but were not converted to that system yet.  They said that the formula they had used discontinued toners or something.  They pointed me to the Library of Paints in Phoenix to get the new stuff mixed up.  Ellis, do you have a sample of the paint you had mixed or any other info we might be able to bring into the store to tip them off that they have mixed this stuff up before?  Want to check out the Library of Paint?    Any more ideas?
