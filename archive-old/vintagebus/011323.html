&lt;&lt; My question is this; does anybody have any suggestions of where to buy
 interior panels for a 1967 walkthrough bus? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jim,
It kind of depends on what type of walk thru you have.  For instance panel van
only had gray painted panels in the front or delux which had them everywhere
and they are the vinyl covered panels with aluminuim strips.
