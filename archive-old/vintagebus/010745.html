Ok, I found these at a garage sale:

And the guy told me that they were from a 1965 VW Bug, however I am a Kombi
guy and no nothing about bugs, except for the fact that they look like a
couple of lights from my old 1975 bug.  Can someone tell me what year range
they are so I can find the right bug owner for them.  I know this isn't the
bug list however most people on this list qualify a VW geniuses.  Also, if
anyone wants them let me know.
