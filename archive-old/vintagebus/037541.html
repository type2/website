The transaxle in the 67 kombi started giving me problem about 2 months ago.  
Mostly just noise and a little heat.  I figured that this was due to a trip 
to San Diego and back.  I changed the oil when I got home and notice a 
minimal amount of shavings at the plugs.  Nothing really too serious I 
thought.  I knew that the tranny was getting old and have been trying to save 
up for a complete rebuild.

I noticed today that the clunking noise coming from the tranny just seemed to 
grow more and more audible when driving around.  When I push the clutch it 
goes away but in neutral or driving it makes quite a racket.  I checked to 
see how much oil was left and found that it was full.  So the levels right 
and I change it on time.  I pull out the two drain plugs and WHAT THE???  
Suckers were just covered in shavings, the largest being about the size of a 
small fingernail clipping.  

So I figure that this sucker is toasted and ready to give up the ghost.  Sure 
is going to suck not having the money for the rebuild yet and this bus being 
my only transportation :(  So does anyone have any pointers on steps that I 
can take to help it work for just a little longer?  Any ideas as to what 
possibly happened?
