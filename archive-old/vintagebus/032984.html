In a message dated 98-08-04 13:18:32 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; you can lower it by switching away from reduction gear boxes (using 68 bug
 axles or swing axle type 3 axles, and flipping the ring gear),  this makes
the
 bus higher geared. &gt;&gt;
This also reduces the amount of bearings that support the bus and it's pay
load.  Thusly you have to expect a increase in repairing and replacing rear
wheel bearings.  We found that changes in the rear of a 1970 bus made for
replacing the rear bearing about 30,000 miles instead of every 100,000+ miles.
All due to installing big american rims with corvette sized wide tires and the
rims that had to use adapters to fit.  The adapters and wider wheels caused a
increase of leverage against the bearings which lead to short bearing life.
Changing small things can lead to big problems.
