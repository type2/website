Subject: Re: Door Panel Patterns??

Hi Dave,
I have some patterns for a '67 I made from posterboard and then used them to 
cut out some baltic birch door panels. I could trace them on some butcher 
paper or something, fold them up and send them to you. They are close but 
not perfect. Also, they don't have the markings for the normal door clips 
since I just used screws. I also have templates for kick panels that I made 
(not perfect) and the overhead drivers compartment panels that I traced off 
some aftermarket ones.

Again, these aren't perfect but they are close enough in my opinion. If you 
want them, just email me your address and I'll mail them to you.

&gt;
&gt;Anyone have a set of door panels they'd be willing to make me some patterns
&gt;of?  A course I'll pay for the material shipping and whatever is a 
&gt;reasonable
&gt;fee.  Of the 2 other Splitwindows here locally neither have door panels on
&gt;them.  I'm getting close to needing to make some but have none to copy.
