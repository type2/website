Subject: Re: [VB] SC Siting

My daughter also spotted what could be the same splitty SC, possibly 
pearl white (she said it appeared to be the same color as my pearl white 
DC), on US 15 north of Leesburg VA a couple days ago.  (We live in that 
area.)  She was so excited, she called me at work right away to tell 
me--she had never seen any other VW truck on the road besides mine.

If you're commuting on US 15 through Lucketts you're passing about 1/2 
mile from my location--one of the few known splitties of any type in 
northern Virginia.  (My neighbor up the road said his son is moving into 
the area with a splitty Dormobile camper, I'll have to keep an eye out 
for him...)

&gt; I was pulled over on the side letting my '67 freedom camper (white, VA 
&gt; plates) cool down for a minute or 5 after the long run down I-68/I-70.
&gt; 
&gt; Waves were exchanged.  Was it anybody on the list?
&gt; 
&gt; So good to be back in a bus...
