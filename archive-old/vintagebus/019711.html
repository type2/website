Just as long as it wasn't up to it's belly in mud, they should be fine.  Of course, you
hve no idea what shape things were in before it was parked.  You can do a lotta damage in 30k.

&gt; Friend of mine found a '66 bus with about 30K original miles.  Been sitting 
&gt; outside for several years.  Pretty rusty but has a lot of good parts.  I'm 
&gt; mainly interested in the mechanical parts.  Anyone have any insight as to how 
&gt; the trans, reduction gears, steering box, etc, might be after sitting outside 
&gt; for a couple decades?
