&gt;also if i were to lower the suspension on a '65 splitty and wanted t&gt;o
&gt;resell
&gt;it would i lose resale value

Simon,
I dont know about te English, but the Australians have evolved into 2
distinct markets. The restorers and the modified or boutique market. The bus
you modify nicely here and do right is worth about the same as a restore at
the moment. This will not be so in a few years. If you are into investment
dont cut or burn your bus, run it stock-ish and able to be made  truly stock
in a short time. (eg. putting the old 40 hp motor back and the old wheels
on.) The other market will be there awhile, but flavour of the month will
change leaving the modified worth a lot less.
