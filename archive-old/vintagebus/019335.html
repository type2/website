This has been going on for almost 4 months now.  Any
suggestions? 

JD,
At risk of being a smart ass, I'd say that it's been
going on for *way* longer than 4 months. Past that
point I can not help. Good luck and contact my main
man Mr. Moe Moore at moe_at_cyclegarden_dot_com for info on a
real club with genuinely nice and knowledgable people.
I'll pay your OCTO dues for you because I'm that kind
of a guy. (not to mention that they have no dues)
Best wishes,
Jim Ellis
Phoenix, AZ
