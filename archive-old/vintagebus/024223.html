Subject: 56 parts

well im back from north battleford sasketchawan - about 10 hours drive
each way - got the roof section i needed the support brackets and even
the vw emblm from a 56 - it seems heavier than the one on my 59/60 - and
is in much better shape - traded away my spare bumper c/w overriders and
brackets but i needed some roof so what can ya do - meet a cool guy
there who should have his 60 panel van primed and almost ready for paint
by now - ran into a snow storm in SE Sask - kinda sucked at 2:00 am but
- i made it

the donar bus was a 56 panel i think - vin was 178 ??? - felt a little
bad taking most of the roof but .... such is life - anyway the bus had
mint rear signal lights and some sort of back up light mounted  above
the signal lights - on the drivers side - the signal lights had a vw
markings but the back up light(?) was marked hella - bus had quite a few
good parts left  - ill pass on any interested emails - i told him about
this list but im not sure he'll join - but the help ive recieved here -
well hard to imagine living with out it

well i hope to glue my roof section on soon - the majority of body guys
seem to think my plan is a good one - that is replace the roof supports
in my bus - use the duratex (sp) to glue the roof down on the top of my
bus - grind out my rain gutters and weld the new section into my rain
gutters - i here the duratex stuff is amazing - kinda like epoxy - but i
do hate to buy the silly gun you apply the stuff with - a $70.00
caulking gun just seems like a rip off

looks like ill soon be ready for another run at the safety inspection -
ive got the high beam indicator working - the heater cables and flexy
thingy - ive tightened the link pins - but i figured farming out the
idler/swing arm lever bushings was probably best since a special tool is
required to ream the new bushings

anyway thanks to everyone - specially the advice about loosening the
nuts on the link pin  - greasing - then tightening - that i think is the
answer - got em much tighter
