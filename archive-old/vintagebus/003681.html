&gt;The engine was running perfectly fine before the knocking
&gt;began. And it really seems to be fine still. So I thought I'd go at it
&gt;looking to find and fix the knock.

that sound like a good idea, and i would take a good look at the
connecting rods and the crankshaft and their bearings, and possibly
the case...and the oil pump and the oil cooler and the pistons and the
cylinders and the cylinder heads and  the camshaft and the lifters and
the carb and the alternator and the wiring and the crusty rusty old sheet
metal and the rusty old muffler and the clutch and the flywheel and the
gland nut and the crank seals and the pushrods and their tubes and their
seals and  the rest of it....hope this helps 8^)
