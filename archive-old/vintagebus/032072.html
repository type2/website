&lt;&lt; Well gang, I finally had my turn at having the plug in a 30/31 PICT give
 out.  Mine is totally gone.  I started for work this morning and the van
 suddenly started popping and missing, no power.  I pulled over and it would
 rev to about 3000 no problem.  I opened the engine compartment and, the plug
 was gone.  Having to get towork FAST, I put 3 lyers of duct tape over it and
 made the trip.
 
 NOW WHAT??????????
 I don't know what is involved in fixing it.  Help.
  &gt;&gt;
take a dime or penny, or similar sized non US coin, and file it down so it 
will fit the hole, but not fall into the carb.  Pennies are easier to file.  
Make sure the size adjusted coin is clean and grease free, and the carb is 
too.  Mix up some JB weld and attach coin to carb, I like to get artsy and 
leave part of the coin visible as a coin.  Let set before driving.  The one 
in my bug had been in there like this for a few years.
