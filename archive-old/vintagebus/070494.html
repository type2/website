Subject: GL-4 question for yahs!

listees,

It has just occured to me, this question:

If the gear oil that goes into the reduction boxes stays in the boxes and
doesn't migrate to the center section, and the reduction boxes don't have
sensitive brass parts, can't we use GL-5 rated gear oil in the boxes in a
pinch?
