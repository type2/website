On top of all of those options, why don't you try using aluminum filler? Made
of real aluminum, and polymers. Sands smooth, bonds like only a metal can and
takes paint like a pro!

&gt; S/C... Then put in the 2lb slidehammer &amp; started
&gt; pullin dents. Not bad ones, most could be got at by
&gt; pullin the interior panels, but a few couldnt be got
&gt; at that way:( Anyway all of em tapped out real nice,
&gt; ALL of em:)
&gt;  Now the Question (always a question, right?) What is
&gt; the best way to fill in the small holes that Ive put
&gt; in it? Been told everything from bondo (not), to lead,
&gt; to Dyna Glass. Anyone know the best way to fill em for
&gt; the long run. Its not gonna be done cheesy. Got a wire
&gt; fed welder, torches with brazin capibilities, ect...
&gt; Whatever it takes.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; David
