Ok, I'll give you that.  Don't forget that they are also _easier_ to clog, 
given the miriad little places for fuel to go (more precise metering).  My
solution is to keep a clean fuel supply.  I dunno, works for me.  This to me
doesn't say POS carb, it says it perhaps needs more care in receiving a clean
supply of fuel.  Try running some rust-laden fuel through a modern fuel
injected car and you get the same result.

&gt; You are welcome to rebuild one of the 34s I have that is clogged, and prove 
&gt; me wrong.  I would like to know a way to get them to clean properly.

I have not been able to clean one out myself one time when I clogged one in 
my '74 b*g.  And I did take it &quot;completely&quot; apart -- so I thought.  There was
an old mechanic around here who was a friend of mine (he has since retired) 
and I brought the ailing carb to him.  I left it with him overnight as it was
late.  He said the reason they were difficult to clean was the check-ball in
the accelerator pump (and I think one other?).  He took these out, cleaned in
there, put it back, and the carb functioned perfectly after that.  I tried to
figure out how he did that later, and he is gone now, so I don't know how to
do that.  But that seems to be the solution.  I would also like to know.  At
that point, I would be happy to clean out your 34s for you if you like.
