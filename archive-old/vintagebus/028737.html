List,

Spent the morning in line at the State Patrol office getting a VIN
inspection on the new bus. If you want to check out some nice rides this
is the place to be. We were in line with a 1930's rod complete with a
blower sticking up through the hood and a couple of clean custom
Harley's. Can you say &quot;billet aluminum&quot;?

The patrolman that did the inspection was pretty knowledgeable about the
bus and volkswagens in general. Besides, who's going to argue with a guy
pack'in a semi-auto under his belt. He had to tell us about the bus he
use to own that caught fire and burned. Then he had the story about the
lady that came in a while back with a '63 single cab. Seems she was
convinced that it was a much earlier model. But when he checked the ID
plate, it was from a late model bug!

The '65 has gone through all the checks so far, and comes up clean. The
next step is filing all the paperwork with the state and waiting for a
new title to be issued. I've updated my site with some more pics and
info on getting a title (in Colorado) when it's lost or missing.

Now for the real bus question. I'm parting out my bent '65 std and need
the cab floor for repairs in the deluxe. Short of just cutting the whole
front off the bus, has anybody removed this floor intact or is it better
to take it out in sections? The deluxe has rust damage running from side
to side, so I really need the whole floor. The front beam is out of the
bus so access top and bottom isn't a problem. Where to cut on the rear
and sides of the floor is pretty obvious. What about along the front?
Suggestions anybody?

Thanks,

Doug Heitkamp
