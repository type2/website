Hi Christian,

WOW!!!

To help in your preparations, you might want to peruse VW Werke's
Technical Recommendation Z4, Journeys Under Difficult Conditions.  You
can find the 1984 edition at
&lt;http://members.tripod_dot_com/~wetwesties/index1.html&gt;.  I also have the
1960 edition scanned, but not set up and online yet.  You don't say what
you're planning to take, so if you are planning on using a pre-loaf bus,
let me know and I'll get the earlier edition together.
