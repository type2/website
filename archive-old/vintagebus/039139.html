Subject: [VB] request for 12V sticker scan
Message-Id: &lt;DB6D4373CBCA3D11785200807C33DA2C_at_rustybus.ireland_dot_com&gt;

Hello list,

I am looking for a scan of the 12V sticker with the lightning bolt that came on the dash of 12 V buses, preferably in .jpg form.  I know I have seen pictures of it on the web but now that I need it I can't find it.  If anyone has a scan I could borrow I would appreciate it.  I hope to have it tonight so I hope some resourceful listees can help me out :)

Hope there is enough bus content in there to keep Everett and Thom from making too many interesting comments about my request :)  

Thanks,
Richard
