&gt;The reduction boxes in a bus are fed through a ~5:1 reduction in the 
&gt;ring gear, resulting in a 5-fold increase in torque.

You're right.  I wasn't thinking clearly.

&gt;Yes, but the thrust loading [for an RGB in an airplane] maxes out at at 
&gt;two or three hundred pounds at most, and is a nice steady force.

Right again.  I was confusing lift and weight with thrust and drag.
The thrust loading is just overcoming the drag of the plane, which
I somehow suspect is rather less than that of a Bus.  :)

&gt;I know the bearings are good for these RPMs (similar bearings are used
&gt;in motorcycle engines) and as long as the gears remain happy everything
&gt;should hang together.

About the only other thing I can think of is lubricant choice...you
want the high-pressure lubricant for the gears, but I would also think
in an airplane that it would tend to be a little colder than on a Bus.
Something like 70 or 80 weight might work a little better than the 90
weight oil usually used.
