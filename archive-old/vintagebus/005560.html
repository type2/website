Hell I've towed the raffle bus faster than that. Buried the needle on the
way to the Classic during some road games with some young tweakers in a
Hyundai. Imagine their surprise, got hole-shotted by not one but two split
busses. The limo is showing about 2200 on the tach at 80, and I've had it at
4 grand. I figure it is well into triple digits, EWAG (educated wild-assed
guess) says 130 or so. The world sure looks different at that speed through
a divided windscreen. Been faster in the orange car, but it feels completely
different in the Westfailure. That long wheelbase really shines above 80,
steady as a rock and the steering is almost precise. You could drive at that
speed all day, county mounties permitting. Lost a u-joint on the return trip
from the Chirco show in Tucson last weekend. Had to limp it home at 80ish,
took near to an hour and a half to go a little over 100 miles. Vibration too
bad at lower speeds, crosswinds too bad for higher. Gotta put her in the air
tomorrow, she don't normally break like that. The Westfailure has a Chevy
tranny and a Ford rearend. It was the Ford u-joint that failed, natch. 8^)

&gt; 86.9 MPH (gps confirmed) on the flats, no wind, no down hill between
fresno &amp;
&gt; bakersfield
&gt;
&gt; I had room to go faster with the engine, but the needle was wrapped around
to
&gt; zero and thought that would be a good point to stop the madness.  Once I
get the
&gt; right size tires on the front, the zero mark should be a few mph higher.
