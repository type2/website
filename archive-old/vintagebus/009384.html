Craig - this is good stuff!  Thanks for the info on the carb jettng.   I've
had that annoying whistle ever since I converted from stock heads to the CB
Eliminator heads and could never figure out what the heck was going on so I
just tolerated it.  The part about using an F7 emulsion tube however is
interesting as it is in direct conflict with what the Weber jetting guide
suggests.  See:
http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/bustech/weber/webertech.htm

I've noticed that when people use a smaller (F7) emulsion tube, then their
jetting sizes go up quite a bit.  When the F11's are used, then the jetting
sizes drop so it's always interesting to see what combinations people settle
on to get their engines to do what they want.

Anyway, ever since I went with the 110 cam and CB heads, the combination has
been far from satisfactory and I'm going to go back to the design that I
really enjoyed and that was use of stock heads except this time, they are
Gene Berg stock DP heads.  Also, I'm dropping the cam size to a Scat C25
(Engle 100 clone) and of course going to smaller jets.  I'm tempted to pull
out the CB venturi mod kit and put the stock ones back in.  I've found out
that port velocity through the carbs and into the heads makes a BIG
difference on where the power comes on at and with all this open-ness on my
current engine, the low end torque is gone.  I need that torque for my
freeway flyer/tall tire combo.

I've learned that when I go with my '62, I'm gonna use a beefed up stock 67
geared trans with tall tires.  This in conjuntion with a T4 2L engine should
give me the stump pulling torque that I need.

Thanks for posting this info.  I hope that people that are interested in
dual carbs take this info and hang on to it because it's the real world
experience posts that make jetting a lot easier game to play.

The only bit of info we were missing is what you altitude was.  It's great
to put the corrolation of jetting and altitude together.

Thanks!

NQ
