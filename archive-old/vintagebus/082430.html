Hi John,
You need to remove the alternator, pulley, and fan.  Then take  them to a 
place that can balance rotating parts.
  We had the same problem when buying a NEW Brazilian made  generator.  When 
we polarized it on the workshop table.  The  generator after coming up to 
speed shook side to side.  We installed it  only to find the whole bus shook with 
the unbalanced generator.  So pulled  out a good used OG generator and after 
installing that had no vibration.
