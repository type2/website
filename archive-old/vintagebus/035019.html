&lt;&lt; Or should I make some cuts into the wood and get some extra
 airflow going in the rear of the Bus? &gt;&gt;

I am just begining the restore on my '58 Westy, and I am LOOKING for wood to 
replace the old stuff that's in very poor condition.  Don't cut the wood!  
That's what makes those interiors so awesome, IMHO.
