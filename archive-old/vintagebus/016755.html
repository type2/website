Subject: acid etch primer Q
Date: Mon, 19 Jun 2000 20:23:10 GMT

Hello Everyone,

Quick bodywork question, I am stripping off the paint from my bus using the 
old wire wheel, and I am planning on putting acid etch primer down against 
the metal, and then building up further layers of primer with less expensive 
non-urethane primer.  Is there a problem with spraying areas with body 
filler with acid-etch?  i.e. does the primer acid-etch any of the filler?  
I'm just using regular bondo filler, if that matters, and we are just 
talking about thin skim coats of bondo here, no creative sculpture of 
structural members or huge dents filled in with the stuff.

Thanks!
