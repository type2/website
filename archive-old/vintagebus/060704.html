&gt; thanks!  i just meant, is 1.8:1 what it is supposed to be stock?  for some

&gt; sure why i thought that.   joshua 

Hi Joshua,
Depends of what year engine!  According to Progressive Refinments.
19MAY59 Now: Ratio of crankshaft pulley/fan drive 1 : 1.75
Formerly: 1 : 2

27JAN61 Now: ratio 1.75 : 1
  Formerly: 1.8 : 1

We have seen figures somewhere for 1.6:1 and 2:1 later, but can not find them 
now.  Also all during this the number of fan blades increased and width 
changed.
