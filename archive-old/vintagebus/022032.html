&lt;&lt; Are the front brake master cylinders interchangeable pre and post 63?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Christian,
Yes, though we suggest using either the $250.00 only 1967 MC, or the $50.00 
1971 and later MC, both are dual circuit.  Which means that you end up having 
half of your brakes if a wheel (slave) cylinder, flex hose, or even metal 
line goes bad you still will have half your brakes to land with rather than 
to just crash.   Eric&amp;Barb
