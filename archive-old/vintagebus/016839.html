Last time I had this happening, I had the wiring for the instrument
cluster confused and had to spend a few hours with the diagrams
understanding how it really works.  The generator bulb actually
grounds through the wire to the regulator (which is connected to the
regulator's output wire and isolated from the battery), and gets
positive voltage from the ignition (which is effectively directly from
the battery).  When the regulator's putting out the same voltage as
the battery, no light.  If it's putting out less than the battery, you
get a light - the brightness directly relates to how different the
regulator's output is from the battery.

Now, if you mess with the cluster's wiring, and arrange that one side
of the indicator light should be going to actual ground and the other
to the regulator, you've set it up so that the light is measuring the
total voltage that the regulator is putting out - dark at no voltage,
bright at full voltage.  This is exactly opposite how it is supposed
to work, and gives you exactly the symptoms you're seeing.
