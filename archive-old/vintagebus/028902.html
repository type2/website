Turnout seemed a bit light to me.  I didn't come home with much.  I gave
most of my money to Ronnie for some new door rubber.  BTW what pieces go
where?  What side face out?  There seems to be 4 pieces for each front door.

Who was it that was looking for Kadron single port manifolds?  There was a
guy (who I personally will not deal with) that had a set of carbs and SP
manifolds for $100.  The coolest bus was the '63 double door deluxe with the
correct double folding middle seat!  Very cool bus....not for sale though.
Even Ronnie said he was impressed...and he hates deluxes ;-)
