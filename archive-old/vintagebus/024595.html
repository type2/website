&gt;Too bad you did'nt make it to the 1st annunal OCTO (NEATO chapter in OC

&gt;Cal.).  There was someone there with NOS interior panels.  If I
remember
&gt;correctly, the guy had some como green ones.   Anybody that went, know
&gt;who that was?   The guy was driving a blue hightop bay window bus.

&gt;ya- that guy- I don't know his name but met him in Jerome- kinda an
older
&gt;hippy guy.

You guys are describing Randy from San Luis Obisbo, if having a long
shaggy/straggly beard qualifies him as an &quot;older hippy guy&quot;.   I have
confirmed that he was the one at OCTO with the nos como green interior
panels.  I saw him at Pomona today and and as of 7:10 pm PST he is not
home yet from Pomona.  Let me know if you need to talk to him and I'll
pass along the message for you.
