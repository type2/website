Hi NQ,
Hmm, if memory serves right Porshe 356 engines used bigger valves witout the 
dual springs!  
 
&lt;&lt;As for valve geometry &lt;Snip&gt;Is there a tool, guage, homemade reference 
gizmo that I can use to check this? &gt;&gt;
Get a large (0-1.&quot;) dial indicator with a magnetic base or make a base that 
be bolted/clamped on the head somewhere.  Then measure the throw at the 
adjusting screws.  Then get each one by one to the halfway point and check 
for the adjusting screws to be parallel to the valve stem and at the same 
time slightly off center to promote rotation of the valve.  
  As for you oil blowby past the forward side of the crankshaft pulley did 
you use a stock pulley with clean good oil slinger grooves.  If so you 
probably need to vent the valve covers!  Be carefull not to shim the fuel 
pump out of whack.
