&gt;But does the power wire from the #56 terminal still send power to the
&gt;lights along with the relay? and will this cause an issue when running
&gt;power to the relays for the lights.

No and no.  The dimmer switch/relay only powers the coils of the relays,
which is around 0.2 amp.  The high current for the lights, 8 to 10 amps
or more, all comes from the new wires you are running.

One way to think of a relay is a plain old push-button switch with an
electric finger to push it for you.  Terminals 30 and 87 are the switch
contacts.  Terminals 85 and 86 are for the electric finger.  The finger
is only mechanically connected to the switch, not electrically.  The
juice you supply to the finger and the juice switched by the switch
are two separate things.

&gt;Can I just buy any 4 prong dimmer switch to use, since mine was a big
&gt;barrel looking thing with 5 or 6 hook ups.

Earlier Buses had a floor-stomp dimmer with three wires.  Later ones
had a relay with 4 prongs (usually) under the dash that was wired to
a contact on the turn signal switch - when you pulled up on the turn
signal lever, the contact switched the relay.  Do you not have either
of these things in your Bus now?

If you're talking about the headlight switch on the dash that you pull
out -- first click running lights, second click headlights -- you have
to keep that in the circuit to run the tail lights, dash lights, etc.
If you have to, you can replace it with a generic headlight switch from
the FLAPS, but your &quot;city lights&quot; in the headlight rims will stay on
all the time and you won't be able to dim the dash lights.
