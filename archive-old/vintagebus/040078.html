I have a glass pack, aka extractor exhaust and was wondering if anyone had 
experience with how changing over to a standard exhaust would affect my gas 
mileage if at all. This is on a 1600 DP, 34pict 3 (I think) Thoughts?  I'm 
working on getting better mileage since we're facing the possibility of 
rising gas prices.

Thanks,
Scott
