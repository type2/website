The list is good :)
The only extreme rarity would be the guided press-in tool, IMHO.
But that is doable... we can fab that, with a little help from the machine
shop. better, stronger, faster....
I have yet to press out the link pin needle bearing bushings from the
kingpin assembly of the '64 front end I'm working on, though, so the OD of
those bushings is yet unknown to me... I'll probably just measure the ID of
the bushing recess and start from there, making 460 and 461 as I go.
Whenever &lt;sigh&gt; this happens, I'll post as to my cost/methods.

&gt;To do a king pin job right you need:
&gt;
&gt;hydraulic press and adaptors
&gt;guided reamer (pre 63)
&gt;guided press in tool, probably rarely used in US due to low quality of
&gt;overall workmanship (63 - 67)
&gt;2 bushings
&gt;2 kingpins (1 lower, 1 upper)
&gt;1 thrust washer
&gt;usually 1 new or used distance piece (4 sizes available, depending on
&gt;individual requirement)
&gt;1 press in cap
&gt;
&gt;I hope I did not forget anything. This is all for 1 side.
