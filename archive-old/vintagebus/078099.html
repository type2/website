Subject: Disc brakes for buses

   This is a heads up for all you split bus owners. I am working with CB
performance on the development of front and rear disc brake kits for our
beloved early buses. To help expedite the development on this I need all of
you to either e-mail or call CB and tell them to get this done. The more
they hear from bus owners the sooner it will get done. They are also
developing their own NEW lowered spindle.
   Another item I am checking fit on for them is factory link pin disc
brakes and beams, these are used units out of Brazil that will be
recondioned.

Thanks to CB for stepping up and taking care of us bus people
