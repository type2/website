''pull back and towards me''??
Reverse is = hold shifter between 1st + 2nd, push down on knob, move shifter
left, move shifter in same direction as 2nd/4th.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It seems impossible to find reverse on my bus, all forward gears work
fine,
&gt; but I feel no ramp or exist into familiar reverse. I pull back and towards
&gt; me, but I feel like I'm hitting second. Rocking from a standstill confirms
&gt; this. This seems to have happend overnight.....?
