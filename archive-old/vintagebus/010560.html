Hi Mike,
Sounds like your idle circuit in the carb body is clogged or the idle jet/s 
are too small or you need to reset your fuel/air mixture screw.  Clean the 
heck out of the carb and reset the air/fuel mixture screw.  If that does not 
do the trick then P-mail us your engine's parameters (Type and model of air 
cleaner, muffler, distributor, carb.) and we can give you an approximate 
jettings for the carb.   Eric&amp;Barb
