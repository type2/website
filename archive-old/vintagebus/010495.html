 Porsche stepped in and started a vintage parts program in

&gt; Stoddard Imports to
&gt; funnel this program through.
&gt; 
&gt; I have heard  rumors that VW is in the process of creating a similar
&gt; program, this would be awesome, it would insure the quality 
&gt; and fit of a lot
&gt; of repo parts and hopefully weed out a lot of the crap out there.

Porsche has even offered a factory restoration service since the late
seventies - just one of the reasons that their customers are among the most
brand loyal in the world.

Merc guarantees the availability of factory parts for any model made after
about '46. These parts are expensive but they are the real thing. This is
one of the services that they offer that have also earned them an extremely
loyal customer base. A mate of mine restored a '69 merc a few years back and
got all of the required parts from his local dealer. It was expensive but it
all fit and worked right the first. The car is his daily driver and is
utterly reliable.

I think VW would do well to start a factory approved parts program. The
parts would be beyond the reach of most teenage bug drivers but would
certainly appeal to people like me who take a long term view of the
ownership of my buses.

End of pet diatribe
