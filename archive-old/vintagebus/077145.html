Subject: [VB] Stranded bus and owners due to bad tranny in Montery CA!!!

&gt; Hi everyone. Maureen, and I are traveling through Monterey Ca, and lost all 
&gt; the gears in our tranny. We have a place to stay with friends, but need a 
&gt; tranny to get back to Canada for Christmas. We are driving a '65 bus converted to 
&gt; I.R.S. 

the folks that broke down in monterey are back on the road with their bus.  apparently one of the rear brake hubs was stripped out.  since irs and disc brakes are a little out of our current reality, we recommended several shops in the area.  the bus, a panel converted camper, was ready to drive and stop again friday.  jon said that the bus had a nice original paint dash.  he also liked the &quot;it's not a car, it's a volkwagen&quot; plate repair with pop rivets on one of the rockers.  ;-)

cheers,
Rachel, Monterey CA			http://home.csumb_dot_edu/~holl1802/pig.html
In a new car, you're just going somewhere;                                
in a Volkswagen you ARE somewhere. -Stormy Henderson's Dad
