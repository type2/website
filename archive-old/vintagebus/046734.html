&lt;&lt; You post makes me wonder how VW addresed the wiper motor in pre 67 buses
 that had the 12v option. Just curious:) &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
VW made a 12 volt motor that one could not tell the differance from the 6 
volt model except for an ink 12 volt stamp on its gear housing.  We found one 
of these once NOS and sold it to someone who needed it worse than us.
