In the case of an accident, the egg effect wouldn't work anymore.  Like if
you take an egg, and squeeze it with your two fingers on opposite sides of
the egg to see how firm it is; then you smash one end of it, and do the same
squeeze, it will be considerably weaker.

&gt; But this is exactly what i'm talking about. I've never seen anything
&gt; factual. Only what people theorize. Theories can lead to a lot of false
&gt; information. The bus should keep its shape just fine with the roof and the
&gt; floor. It's the egg effect.
