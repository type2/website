Subject: Re: Media vs. Sandlasting

Hi,

I'll throw my 2c in here.

You need special equipment.

Soda Blasting equipment is only available for rent in large  
metropolitan areas. The D/FW area, for example, has only a couple for  
rent right now. I'm sure Houston has one as well, but I was not able  
to locate one. I live in between those two metros (Austin). The other  
thing is that you will kill any soil in or around the blasting area  
due to the bicarbonate media.

The better method, in my opinion, is dry ice blasting. The media,  
obviously, dissipates on contact. The media is almost as course as  
soda blasting, but not as course - and no metal warping due to no  
heat build-up. Unfortunately, I do not know where you can rent this  
type of equipment - but you may be able to locate a service that uses  
this equipment in a large metro area.

Conrad

&gt;
&gt; Wow, you're the second ones who have mentioned soda blasting.  I  
&gt; had never
&gt; heard of it?  Is it a lot more work or difficult than sand?  Is it  
&gt; easy
&gt; enough to get a hold of?  Most importantly, is there any special  
&gt; equipment
&gt; that has to be used with it.  Can it be substituted for grit with the
&gt; sandblaster?
&gt;
&gt; Aloha, J.D.
