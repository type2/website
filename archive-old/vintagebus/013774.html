Subject: [VB] tie rods, fuel guage, clutch adjust nut...

Were workin on a 62 SC....
I searched the archives... didnt come up with
anything. So..... On the tie rods, why were there two
types, adjustable &amp; non? Witch one is the best? I have
2 front ends off early T1s (late '50, early '60) in
good shape (both are adjustable), will the tie rods
interchange? I realize we'll have to do some mods, but
will they fit in the knuckle corectly? 
 On the fuel guage, the sender is 6 volt, as is the
guage. The truck has been converted to 12V. Do I need
to run a resistor to drop the V to 6-8V or will it be
alright. (not gonna hook it up till I know fersure the
Magic Smoke wont be let out with 12V:)
 Clutch adjust... this will be an easy one:) The PO
took off the adjuster on the cable _at_ the trans, it now
sports a 13mm nut w/ a big washer. Did the adjuster
originally look like all T1s with the wing nut look?
Ive been drivin it around, but this friday its gettin
put up on blocks and the serious work begins.
Thanks
