Subject: parking my bus


list-
since i have owned my bus it has been a daily driver, but the time has come 
when i have to part with her for about a year. my wife and i are going back 
to chicago fo another year of school and last years winter and salt weren't 
too kind tothe bus. so we aregoing to be leaving it in washington for a 
year. what should i do to it? i will be back for christmas so i can start 
her up then, but i was wondering if i should do anything special so that 
when i come home for good the bus won't have any problems due to inactivity. 
thank you in advance for your years of experience and advice.
kind regards,
thomas
