Jim, Don't be afraid to ask stupid questions...just search the archives first (www.type2_dot_com) and don't flame someone on the list if they write you a p-mail (personal mail) telling you that your question is stupid...or you should drive a Toyota...or that you have boogers in your nose. Keep flames in p-mail and everything will be fine. If someone flames you publicly, resist the temptation (as best you can) to retaliate publicly. Everything will be fine.

Now, on to your problem: I converted my '64 to 12-volts and I found that some of the relays didn't have a 12-volt counter part...or at least I couldn't find one. The flasher and headlight relays come to mind. I couldn't find a 12-volt flasher or headlight relay that had the same internal 'wiring'/functionality. This meant that I would have to re-wire the bus to the new flasher/headlight relay combination and I'm not bright enough to do that...so I used the old 6-volt relays. Going on 5 months now; still working fine.

I do know that you'll need a 6-volt wiper motor or a voltage drop; that motor will fry itself if you try to run 12-volts into it.

You should be okay, I think, for your switches.

Smoking headlights: 
YOU CAN'T ASSUME THAT THE PO DID A COMPLETE JOB CONVERTING TO 6 VOLTS!!!! POs are insidious people, by their very nature. They are all hacks. ;) except for those of &gt;us&lt; who sell our buses (; Anyway, I'd check the bulbs first. Are they 6-volt bulbs? They'll run hot if they are, and burn out or catch fire or summon Pele, the Hawaiian volcano god. Check them. Fix them. Check all your bulbs for 12 volt markings ***especially those little internal bulbs like overhead and dash indicator bulbs!!!*** You *will* burn up your little plastic covers if you run 6 volt bulbs inside the bus. You may also think your warning lights aren't going off when they are really just blown! And then your engine will fry and you will cry. If you find they're 12-volt bulbs, check for shorts and/or bare wires in or just before the connection to the light. Make sure the ground wire is tight and has a clean connection.

&gt;1966 westy that sat in the woods for a long long time.This bus was apparently
&gt;converted to 12 volt by some PO. I know this because the tranny had been
&gt;grinded
&gt;out and it had a 12 volt voltage regulator.

Like I said, they're all hacks. Don't ASSuME he did it right. You may even be running a 6-volt starter. As long as he used the *right* flywheel, that may be better than a 12-volt starter (IMHO). The flywheel on a 12-volt bus usually has 132 teeth. The bendix of the starter must match those teeth patterns. There were a couple years, though, when there was a 109-tooth flywheel available for the bus ('65 and '66, I think). The 6-volt flywheels match up to these. So...if you have a 6-volt starter and a 109-tooth bus flywheel, you're cool--except that your solenoid on the starter doesn't like 12 volts; it'll work for a while, but one day it will die. Fortunately, you can pull the solenoid from a 12-volt starter and match it right up. Then again, you may have a 12-volt starter/flywheel combination already. Here are the variables you'll have to mix and match. The trick is to get a pair in 12-volts:

109 teeth + 200 mm diameter flywheel; 6-volt starter w/12-volt solenoid.

132 teeth + 200 mm diameter flywheel; 12-volt starter

There's also a smaller flywheel out there, but for some reason, I think these aren't good to use on buses...or can't be used, or something. I don't know. Someone smarter needs to address this. I figured it all out one time by reading up in &quot;How to rebuild your aircooled VW engine&quot; or &quot;How to hotrod your vw engine&quot; but I solved my problem and then forgot the details.

As for the starter, the most important thing I'd suggest short-term is to disconnect the coil wire, and crank the starter for about 10 seconds; then go under and feel your wires at the starter.._dot_careful now, they may fry your fingertips. IF THEY'RE HOT, you have a bad connection between the battery and the starter or a serious short. This will cause hard cranking, especially in the winter/cold, and it can cause your wires to fry in place, catch fire, burn the bus, etc. 

&gt;I'm also can't get my turn signals, horn,and brake light to work. The  PO
&gt;drove it after converting to 12volt.But it Still has all  6 volt signal
&gt;relays, etc. 

In addition to checking for correct bulbs, check for corroded connections. You probably have corrosion at most of your connections; these need to be filed/scraped/cleaned/whatever so that they make the connection again. I simply scrape mine off, but a lot of people are anal about it and dip them in coconut butter or some wild concoction that cleans them off and turns them to solid gold. The point is, the corrosion will block the flow of electricity. If your bus had water dripping into the dash (and even if it didn't), you may have some corrosion at switches too. Disconnect your battery when you're working on these. Only work on one at a time. You'll know why the first time you arc a hot wire to the dash or get confused and can't figure out whether that green wire goes here or there.

&gt;Should I change all of the  6 volt stuff out or can I
&gt;use a voltage drop to make them work.

Somewhere in the archives (www.type2_dot_com) there are lists of what needs to be changed and what doesn't. Try searhing on &quot;conversion&quot;. Also, you may or may not get your gas gauge to work. After sitting in the woods a long time, there's a good chance the sending unit is stuck in place; there's also a good chance that the old 6-volt gauge is in there. According to Bus Guru Clara Williams, some of these work on 12-volt and some don't. You'll just have to try and see.

&gt;All the wires are hooked up according to the 66 wiring diagram and i could not
&gt;find any wrong connections or
&gt;faulty fuses.

Might also check for grounds/shorts. My favorite trick is to pull the positive side of the battery off and just touch it to the post. Do it at night. If there's a spark/arc, then there's a short somewhere in your bus. This isn't necessarily true if you have a radio with a clock or any accessories that are on all the time. You have to disable those for this trick to work.

Congratulations on your new bus. Have fun! Don't forget to check and replace and clamp ALL your fuel lines and check that all the fittings into the carb and fuel pump are tight. And for crying out loud, make sure you don't have boogers hanging out your nose!

Joe
