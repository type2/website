Subject: RE: [VB] FW: Double Cab Canvas


They will not deal
&gt; again with VW
&gt; People. --That is their choice not mine--Two VW
People DID
&gt; give this company Two bad checks.  Thus all dealings
&gt; with VW People were
&gt; ended by this Company--That was their decision not
&gt; mine.

I wonder what happened to the two canopys they made,
that they didn't sell? They had to sell them to some
sort of VW people. They should use telecheck for now
on, for verifying those sort of transactions.
 Mike
