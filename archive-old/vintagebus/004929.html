Incase anyone is interested,
   Hot Wheels has put out yet another variation of their VW Bus. This on is
purple and black and  comes with an Interactive CD ROM. I got mine yesterday
at 'Toys R Us'. It is a little pricey at $37.26 with tax. They had a few of
them but I only got one. They also had a couple of the white Bus with the
Car Designer CD ROM for about $20.00. I could get one for someone if they
can't find it.
  I'm looking for one of the Thunderbird Busses if any one has one. I also
have a couple of the others to trade for.
