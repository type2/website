Subject: Safari instal question

    I finally got around to installing my OG Safaris in the flip seat. Now I
have a question before I proceed. When installing the window slider brackets
to the body do you cut the seal to go around them or does the seal go
underneith, somebody out there must have a set of safaris installed would
could answer the question, only 5 days to have 2 buses ready for Jerome,

TIA  ronnie

ps. OG Safaris are the best with CE a close second. I tried the early set I
have first and the gap at the bottom of the window is way more then with the
late set. I have a clean 4mm approx. gap on all 3 sides.
