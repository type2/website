Subject: Part Numbers

Hello to all,
As some of you know by now, I have been struggling to identify who did
the conversion on my '67 Bus.  I think it was Sundial, and I have gotten
many, many opinions on this.

At any rate, my son and I were tearing out what there is of my Camper
interior, getting it ready for paint, when we found a sticker on the
back of one of the panels.  Its a 1&quot; X 4&quot; sticker with several boxes,
printed with information.  The numbers and info are:

Part Number:  211 845 122 A
Qty:  2
Pkg Slip #:  132729
Ord. No.:  00M1761
Whse Location:  ED028D2
Dealer No:  426032
Destination:  Weather St.
Dealer Location:  426032

While I realize that this is a Volkswagen part sticker, the dealer info
interests me.  Does anyone have a record of Dealer #'s from 1967?  Can
anyone identify the part #, or anything else about any of these numbers?

Any assistance would be appreciated in getting me a little closer to
solving this mystery.

Thank you all,
Ed Richardson
67 Sundial (?)
66 Sedan
63 Ragtop
