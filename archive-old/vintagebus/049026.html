The 1776 motor in my '63 DC lost power and developed a rod knock on the first mountains on the way to Lake Havasu last Friday. Kinda glad it happened there, only 10 mi. from my parent's ranch in Arvin. So Karl and I stashed it there and went on to the campout. Decided to tow it back with his 77 Westy. A brake booster on a bay beam won't let a towbar (thanks Uncle Jerry) mount centered, so I rode in the truck keeping it crabbed to the right while Karl did his best to scare the snot out of me with the fishtailing... in the rain... at night... on a truck saturated freeway. As memorable as Fat Tire ale, just more terrifying.
So tonight, got a lot done...
Took the towbar off the truck, pushed it into the street. 
Adjusted the front beam of the EV Thing  and moved it out of the repair bay
Pushed the DC into the driveway, by myself, neighbor wasn't around. 
Pulled the engine and took stuff off until it was light enough to lift into the stand. 
Pulled the heads and surprise, #2 cylinder's rings seized or something, breaking the upper part of the piston. It hammered some metal into the head, but not too bad. The cyl slid right off. 
The cyls were honed and new rings installed a week ago! Maybe the #2 rod bearing seized, causing the damage. Crank turns, but not real easy. 
Didn't have time to split the case. Will drop a super magnet into the oil bucket to see how much crap got circulated. I picked up a remote oil filter at L.Havasu to install. So it's fun with cranks this weekend.
