Well,
I wouldn't count out BaySplits  just yet...  They make more than just split
window noses...  Thom...did you touch it at all? or knock on it?  maybe some of
it is fiberglas?  I've seen pics of a bunch of brazilian buses...but none like
this....but, by no means does it mean it isn't possible.

&gt; Well Ronnie - what about the narrow hatch, round tail lights, and skylights?
&gt; I don't think this would be a baysplit - more a brazilian in nature I would
&gt; say.  Who knows though - with good body men these days, you can expect to
&gt; find anything...
