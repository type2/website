Subject: Re: [VB] bay beam under a split

yes, you can put a 68-69 bay beam under your split.   It makes it ride a 
little taller (this had been done to a 59 truck I had). So I meant to put 15&quot; rims 
on teh back and 14&quot;s on the front.   It had ball joint instead of king pins.  
 Some people like that

Personally I like the king pin ride.

 It had bigger front brakes than the original 59 style, also bigger than the 
64-67 style.  same front cylinders as 64-67, just bigger shoes/ drums.
evidently you can put later/ disc brake spindles on the beam and get disc 
brakes.

I've heard of people putting an early bay beam under their split... what is 
the benefit of that? Better ride or something?
