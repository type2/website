Ok, I got the trailing arms out.  Managed to slightly munge the ends on one
side, but I think it's recoverable.

I took Ronnie's suggestion and removed the movable side, then tried
pounding thru the other way.  It was moving a little, but not much.  So I
put a 1/8&quot; socket over the torsion bar, used my monster 3-arm puller, and
pushed the torsion bar thru.  The last couple inches were still difficult,
but I got it out.

Now that I have them out, what now?  I don't have the parts to rebuild them
properly.  I'm thinking I should clean them all up, re-grease them, and put
it all back together.  A lot less chance of munging or losing parts that
way!
