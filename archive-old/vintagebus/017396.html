Ok, I went and actually looked at my two engines.  The 1600 does not
give any appearance of a washer, crush or otherwise, between the oil
pressure switch and the case.  There is a slight gap there, though.
The 1300 does have some kind of washer, but it also has a piece of
copper tubing that extends out a couple of inches, and then does a
right-angle turn up.  The switch screws into the vertical part of the
tube.  It's not clear if this is a stock setup or not.
