Subject: Re: [VB] upper  engine bolt.  aaargh

&gt; I'd go into my technique of gluing the bolt in there as I do, but what
&gt; the hey..


iffen it has the doghouse cooler, it can be a mother to get a nut in there.
Its probably worth the time to drop the engine and JB weld a nut on the
backside of the case. I did this on the type 3 conversion I just did, took
one look at the missing insert and said no way to that, JB welded a nut to
the case, snugged it down with a bolt, and let it dry overnight, instant
case insert. Now it'll take a minute to get that bolt back in.
