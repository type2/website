Subject: Transaxle tech, what do I have in my bus right now?

Just rolled in from Vegas, had to return Tristan (my girl) to the airport...
Clara went out on the same flight back to Seattle.

This is now about the 4th time I've taken this trip, so I was getting pretty
bored.  Last week when coming from Vegas to Havasu I had Clara in the bus
with me, the issue of my tranny and plans to replace it came up.  We got
into a discussion about how you could tell what you had in their now... and
she told me to compare the RPM at various speeds.

So today to follow-up... I took my RPM gauge out of the parcel and held it
in my hand with the GPS sitting on the speedo cluster.

  --- I used a GPS device that I have a lot of experience with, so expect
the MPH figures to be VERY ACCURATE.
  --- The rear tires are 185R14 brand new tread and pumped up at 50PSI.
  --- I have a 1967 Westy with large nut redux boxes (1.25 ratio, right?)
  --- The RPM gauge is a 1 year old Suntac that I hooked-up.  Who knows if
it is correct.  Seems right at idle... if the numbers don't jive, let's take
a closer look at it :)
  --- I spent at least 30 seconds at that exact speed and RPM to make sure
that the GPS was right on and that I was getting as close as possible on the
numbers.

Here is what I found:

  ==== 4th Gear ====

   2500 RPM I was going 40MPH
   3100 RPM I was going 50MPH
   3700 RPM I was going 60MPH
   4000 RPM I was going 65MPH

  ==== 3rd Gear ====
   2500 RPM I was going 28.5MPH
   2650 RPM I was going 30MPH
   3100 RPM I was going 35MPH
   3575 RPM I was going 40MPH
   4000 RPM I was going 47MPH

So, does this mean I have a bug tranny?  What is the 4th gear and R&amp;P ratio?

Thanks.
