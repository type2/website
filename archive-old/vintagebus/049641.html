Subject: year plate trivia

Some of you may remember that there was some confusion amongst the list on
my truck's m-plate: while the numerals on the upper left are stamped &quot;06  4
&quot; (meaning, supposedly, April of 64), the id # is xx5148182, and Vw sent me
a birth certificate reading MAY 5-11 of 65. We best guessed that Hans had
slipped up at the end of a long day stamping plates, and had put a 4
instead of 5 in the year spot. OR Siftung was wrong!

Well, I was ogling Michael Moore's Kombi FS, and his birth cert gives us
xx5143678, and a build date of April 28-30, 65... so my truck IS an early
May, 65.

Two things of note: they were turning out nearly 4000 busses a week in 65,
and that it took LONGER to make the pickup (even allowing May 7 and 8 being
a weekend).

Ah, meaningless trivia :)
