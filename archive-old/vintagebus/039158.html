Hi all'


Now it's time to vent! Those bloody panelbeaters left a whole bunch of
little surprises for me in my bus. On inspecting the shell carefully I
compiled a two page list of faults. These ranged from slightly
irritating to #$%_at_(+|infuriating. The worst of the lot was that the load
bed and rear cabfloor area were sprayed without doing any prepping, they
didn't even go as far as removing scale rust in theses two areas. Too
many other things to mention but those two are the worst.

What I found weird was that the shell looked like it had been worked on
by two sepperate sets of panel men. The major part of the job, that is
the pure metalwork of fabbing new panels, welding them in and
straightening the body had been done beautifully. There isn't a ripple
on the flanks and the flat panels are like mirrors.

But then when it got to the interior it looks as though the first set of
panel men were replaced by a group of apprentice road marking painters
&gt;from a home for crack addicts with Attention Deficit Disorder. The
interior has been resprayed without so much as a light sanding first,
much less a coat of primer. Apart from the rust on the floor there are
also places where little piles of paint dust have been sprayed over.

All I can imagine is that the owner felt at a point that he had
underquoted and decided that it was time to get the bus out of his shop
and cut his losses. I guess he probably phoned the panelman and told him
to finish the &quot;damn thing today&quot;.

This resulted in me going in this morning and putting a rocket up the
owner. He appologised a lot and said that I could bring it back and my
list of faults would be rectified.

I am so disapointed that I feel like going on a drinking spree and then
shooting some panelbeaters but I guess that would be rude.

All I can do is hope that the owner decides to honour our agreement and
do the job right. His company has a good reputation as far as beetle
restos are concerned and I hope that the idea of an extremely unhappy
and vocal customer will convince him to do the job properly regardless
of any mistake he may have made as far as the quote was concerned. BTW I
was charged a bit less to resto the shell than he sells a complete resto
70's beetle for so it wasn't cheap.

Sorry about the vent!
