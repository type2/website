&gt; Well, the tranny case on my 65 has the notch, and with the doghouse etc I

&gt; put a wrench or socket on it.

that sounds like a good idea, I will do that.

&gt; I guess Take a good flashlight in the engine compartement and...um. Double 
&gt; check that you have the insert in the case.  Some engines don't.    So if 
&gt; there's a nut undo it with yr 17mm.  Can be tricky if you have  doghouse, but 
&gt; you can reach it.  awkwardly.

I am able to worm my way around the doghouse &amp; see the insert,
complete with scars from a wrench. So it is definately the insert.

&gt; If yours does have the case insert, the DPO must have tightened the bolt down 
&gt; somehow.  So get under there with the tools and undo it, or just cut the 
&gt; d*%nbolt off.

yea, somehow. I would love to take a monkey wrench to the side of his
head right now. :) Andy suggested that there is actually enough
clearance in the notch for the bolt to rotate. I'm going to try it
again after work tonite now that I am rested up. but if not I guess I
will have to cut it off.

Oh and speaking of previous owners. The bolts that hold on my drivers
side gearbox on are wheel lug bolts! The ones with the taper shoulder.
Unfortunately 2 of the bolts on that side will not hold the spec
torque so I will have to do some sort of thread insert.
