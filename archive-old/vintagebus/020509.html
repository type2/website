According to Vintage Vacations (trailer collector)
website, the Aristocrat line was started by Irv Peach
in 1956. Could this trailer be a 1960?  A quick phone
call to the current owner confirms her understanding
that it is indeed a &quot;50's&quot; vintage. Very nice lady...
I found no photo examples to which I could refer.
Perhaps the current owner could post a photo ad on
VWPlanet under the &quot;Other&quot; category. Good luck with
the sale. I'm sure it's cute enough and will fit
someones' needs.
