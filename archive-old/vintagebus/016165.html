    I have a '66 Standard in need of new rocker panels and other body
work in the DC, N. Va. area.  Do you know of a reputable place where I
can take my bus for this work?  I have had many a bad experience with
so-called VW specialists around the area.  Also, what can I expect to
pay for replacing both rockers?  Any info would be greatly appreciated!
