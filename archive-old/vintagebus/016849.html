Are you talking about true galvanizing (hot dipped), or
so-called'electro-galvanizing' (zinc plating)?
True galvanizing can warp stamped parts, due to the intense heat involved,
but the rust protection is outstanding.

Zinc electroplating is definitely second best, but cheaper and easier.
Most new cars with gavlanized steel body parts are only electroplated, some
on one side only.

Actually I didn't have any of the parts truly hot-dipped galvanized, except my
side step. I had this spray on zinc coating, high pressure. I was told that it
should last almost as long as the hot dip. Hot dip, i was told, would last
probably over 40 years.

The guy in charge recommended against the hot dip, because he was worried some
of the parts might warp.
