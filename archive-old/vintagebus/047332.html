&lt;&lt; If you use steel line in a place where it flexes it will fail. &gt;&gt;
Hi George,
This is very true of Okrasa VWAC kits. The fuel outlet from the fuel pump was 
connected by a very shot section of flex line to an all steel fuel line to 
the carbs.  This steel fuel line T-eed above the fuel pump and went to each 
carb where each end was bolted to the carbs directly.  All too often this 
steel fuel line broke near the T on the way to the carbs due to just the 
vibration of the engine.   Eric&amp;Barb
