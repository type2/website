I have the wire tray
I have the little plastic shelf w/ the drain hose
I have a hose that runs through the floor

I took mine all apart last summer
removed the door
removed all the little screws that hold the plastic tub we call an ice box, 
removed the seal

drove down to the appliance store

bought two big cans of refridgerator spray foam, used 1.

but the thing back togther
filled all the nooks and cranies with the expanding spray foam

replaced the door and the seal
replaced the drain hose
replaced the water tank and hose

now it will keep a block of ice for three days
keeps beer cold, keeps our food cold
keeps the fish i catch cold
drains fast and doesn't drip water on the things below, but then again i drive slow
the moral, your ice box can be made into a good ice chest if you just take a little time.
i have no room for an extra ice chest, now that i am more than 1.
