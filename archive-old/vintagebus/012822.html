&lt;was said&gt;
Driving with a spare clutch cable and some simple tools and grease is a
better skill to have.
&lt;&gt;

In my case it wasn't a simple clutch cable... it was a broken cross shaft that holds the throw out bearing.  Not quite so simple to fix on a Sunday night after 5:00 PM when you have to be at work the next afternoon in another state.  I have swapped engines on the side of the road on a trip in less time than it takes most people to change a tire, but you have to have the parts and I didn't have a clutch, bearing and cross shaft in this particular instance.

Richard (just a friendly word in my own defense ;)
