Subject: Wheel Straightening advice

I called Mag Masters (Santa Ana, CA) today and they quoted me $65/ea. to 
straighten &amp; true my 15&quot; wheels. $325 for a set of 5 sounds like I'm buying 
them all over again... :(

I might not do all of them, depending on the condition, but does this seem 
realistic?
