Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

Well,

My '62 EZ is road ready, I drive it around my neighborhood all of the time, 
but I have not received the registration and plates yet. That is not a Boo 
Hoo. It would be a true Boo Hoo if I got pulled over and got my baby 
impounded! If I had the plates this new 1600SP would have miles on it, even 
though I only work 5 miles from my home!

Daily Driver in Waiting,
Joshua

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;all this &quot;bus sighting&quot;  &quot;stuff&quot; (to put it
&gt;politely) leads me to ask the following question/take the following
&gt;poll:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;how many of you actually DRIVE your bus
&gt;DAILY?!?!?!? (i will also accept any air-cooled vw in place of &quot;bus&quot;). NOT 
&gt;a
&gt;honda, ford, chevy, whatever, but a BUS (or air cooled vw)?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;no lame &quot;boo-hoo, i have to drive on the freeway&quot;
&gt;excuse. i do too--every day. i go 60-65 and people pass me.
&gt;
&gt;no &quot;boo-hoo, it's too cold&quot; wuss-out. i drove my
&gt;busses every day in cold pennsylvania winters for years--it's called making 
&gt;the
&gt;heat work well and learning to drive with gloves and a hat. i also learned 
&gt;to go
&gt;to the car wash somewhat regularly to wash the salt off, and my busses 
&gt;didn't
&gt;rust out.
&gt;
&gt;no &quot;boo-hoo, but i have to drive &quot;X&quot; amount of
&gt;miles every day&quot; whining. i drive my bus about 50 miles a day.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;i don't even own any other kind of car, so what
&gt;else WOULD i drive?!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;i'm just curious.
