are pics of a bay dormobile that was FS at PIR last July.  It actually 
doesn't have the wide bed that I have seen in the splitty SO-44s.  I don't know if 
it was replaced or not. If I wanted a bay camper I'd have got it.

Hi Andy,
Yes, our mistake, too early in the morning!  Hmm, that might be why we could 
not find 1968 and later SO-44s!
Thanks,
Eric&amp;Barb
