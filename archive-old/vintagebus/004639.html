Hi Everyone,

A Volkswagen buddy came over and showed me how to adjust the master cylinder
push rod.. Brake pedal is now ok, will replace the return spring soon.
Thanks for the part# Clara. My friend and I took the truck for it's first
adventure tonight. We had a blast, jamming to the ole' Am Radio, bumpers and
other oddities squeaking like all get out..yee haw.  I love this truck, I
don't mind that its a bit rough. He's got alot of character and I'm able to
throw my tools and stuff in the back with out worrying about scratching
pretty paint (kinda a Dove Blue primer now).
I named the single cab &quot;Super Sonic&quot;, though I call him &quot;Sonic&quot; for short.
I had a long talk with him last night and I sure we're gonna be pals.
So what's my question? Where are all the info #'s on this truck? There is
one to the right behind the engine on the fire wall, but I have yet to find
any others. Do I not have an &quot;M&quot; plate? Where is the chassis #?
Thanks for the help.

sincerely,


Tom
1955 Single Cab &quot;Super Sonic&quot;
