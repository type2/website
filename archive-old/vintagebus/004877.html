&gt; Well I see I am in the minority on this one.  But..... Doesn't Vintage
mean
&gt; 25 + years?

i agree with this to a point. (i'll explain a bit more in a mo)

&gt; We are all bus brothers and sisters, people with splits are not any better
&gt; than people that drive bays.

i wish this wouldnt keep coming up. -suggestions like this create bad vibes
between the good bus folk in this world - i dont think anyone anywhere
thinks they are better than another for owning something older.

what i do think tho - is that there are one hell of a lot more bays than
splits. the problem with full integration is then actually finding the much
swamped older stuff. i dunno if i explained that right - it'd be like
finding a certain rice crispy in the box.
as things are theres a definite place to go. what the bays need is something
of their own, beetles their own and so forth.
anyone who drives both or wants to find something from one to fit to another
or such like can easilly do so.

that 4 pence i put in to the pot.
