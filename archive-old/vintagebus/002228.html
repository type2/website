Subject: more windshield woes

it figures. I have replaced nearly every piece of rubber on my 21 =
window. I had neglected to do the windsheilds for sometime. But the days =
or driving with wet knees and a soaked floor needed to come to an end. I =
anxiously awaited the seals along with my other parts for making the bus =
roadworthy for my 1800 mile journey to oregon. After struggling with the =
driver side for 20 min and realizing I had the seal on backwards, I =
cursed and carefully approaced the passenger side. I cut off the old =
seal and put a little pressure from the back to get the window out. and =
CRrrrrak. more cursing. idle threats to sell the bus, and pacing =
followed.  not the kind of thing i needed after a long day of bad work. =
And so here my bus sits. jacked up 3 feet off the ground with the engine =
sitting behind it, cause im waiting to helicoil the head. the trannie =
still in it, cause i dont have a 46mm 1/2 socket to drop it and change =
the mounts and input seal. and now a broken windsheild.=20

So. does anyone out there have a replacement passenger side window? id =
rather not pay the 160+ for the set. Im on a tight budget as I am moving =
in under a month, and it seems every time I try to fix something I find =
something else wrong.

any help wouldbe greatly appreciated. im tired of calling RMMW. I think =
they are getting suspicious. =20

I will sing and dance for parts.=20
(the singing may be sub-par, but dancing is unique)

sigh.=20
