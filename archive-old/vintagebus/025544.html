      What this means is your light/signal switch is dying, Get a new one
before you lose your headlights entirely.

&gt; Hi,

&gt; In an effort to make owning a bus more fun, VW engineered in some time
&gt; delayed features into my bus. The latest feature is make its appearance is
&gt; &quot;hi-signals.&quot; This is an exciting new feature where upon fully engaging the
&gt; right turn signal the high beams come on. On the lucky occasions when the
&gt; self canceling feature works this phenomenon reverses itself. This feature
&gt; is not dependent on the headlights being switched on.
