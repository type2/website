Subject: upper  engine bolt.  aaargh

Well, when I put the motor back in my 65, I forgot to start the engine 
bolt above the clutch arm before putting the motor in.  I figured, 
stepping on the clutch would move the arm enough to get it in there.  
It won't.  Is there a trick to getting that engine bolt through without 
pulling the motor?  I do 100% of this work alone, and most of the time 
out in the cold.  Any ideas?

Thanks

Don J
65 EZ, (one engine bolt away from driving around for the first time in 
3 years )
