Subject: [VB] Friday - My white board


Earlier this week, a friend of our family and his wife were over for dinner
when he noticed that I had scrawled something about doing something on the
street behind Castle Boutique (sex shop) on the white board by our phone.
 It had been on the board for about 2 weeks but for some reason my wife
never saw it.

I get home from work and my wife and the 2 of them ask me &quot;What are you
doing at the Castle Boutique?   Of course, I'm like &quot;Huh? What are you
talking
about?&quot;   And my wife says &quot;You have a note on the board about going to
the Castle Boutique to look at something.&quot;  So, of course, I laugh and reply
&quot;You know everything on that board is Volkswagen stuff, someone told me
there's a '67 Westy at somebody's house on the street behind it.&quot;

Woah, I dodged that bullet...  ;)
