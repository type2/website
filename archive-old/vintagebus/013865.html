Was Wrote....
 I have a very early 1967 Dormobile (July 5, 1966
production, 874th off the line).  My production plate
reads:&gt;&gt; 05 7
Hmmm.... this presents a question:How many buses didVW
build in one day??

Then---
My 67 Standard was built on 05 7 also. It is #000625.
If you subtractthis
from yours, 874, that means at least 250
werebuilt/assembled on July5th?
--------end
quote------------------------------------However....
My early 67 which shows  06 7 on the tag, and is
serial #0000559, soo, how does this fit into the
equation?
