Subject: The First Real Drive

Just a note of my excitement. I got to take the bus out for a descent drive 
tonight. 15miles.  This is the first real drive since last July when I 
bought this thing.  It was a dream come true.  My Dad next to me we cruised 
up to 60 and listened to the glass pack roar.  Still plenty of body work to 
do but I'm happy to just have it road worthy finally. Thanks for everyones 
advice and replys over the last few months.  Your wisdom has been priceless. 
Louise (the bus) and I are traveling out to South Dakota for two months 
starting in mid June. Lot's of work to be ready for that but not a bit of it 
unenjoyable.  Again thanks for the help and for listening to my joy and 
elation.  Thanks for the parts and all that too.

Scott
