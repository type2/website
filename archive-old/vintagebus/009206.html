Last night my good ol' Mom helped me with the covering of my parcel tray in
about $4.00 worth of store-bought denim.  As big as I am, my old overalls
just didn't supply enough material for the project.  I used a bunch of spray
glue and some help and I now have a nice denim covered parcel tray in the
bus.  It looks absolutely awesome!

As soon as I get my fuel guage from RMMW and my clock back from Eric and
Barb, the dash area is gonna look really neat!
