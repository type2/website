&gt; Great advice!  It really is the ticket for improving longevity, to

&gt; Stainless Steel muffler and do the jet coat, no tellin how long these
&gt; components will last.

My engine mechanic finally did what he had been dreaming and threatening
to do for years - which is to take apart a heater box shell and duplicate
it in stainless sheet, and reweld it. He was happily bragging about it
last week over the phone. We both did the Jet Hot thing during my
restoration to our extractors. 

Mufflers are expendeble, its the heater boxes which are the problem. 

By the way - to the list ----

the cost of doing an extractor at Jet Hot in 1995 was $165 plus return
shipping.
