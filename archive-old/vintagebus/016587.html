By &quot;GRB&quot; do you mean &quot;RGB&quot;?  yes, there's a seal, but that might not be your
problem.  MOre likely it's the axle seal that's gone bad.  You need to 
remove all the brakes and stuff to get to it.  Before you do, buy 4 rear
wheel seal kits for your bus.  I always buy 4 because it takes me a couple
seals to get one on without it leaking :(
