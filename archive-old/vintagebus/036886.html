I saw one at pomona a year ago. Beat up, original paint. Price was 150$
I posted an ad for one a few months back on vw planet.
Got three responses, all were 150$ but somehow they all wanted to trade for 
them.
I couldnt come up with anything to trade.
Hope I find one eventually.

Has a little peddle that you push and it &quot;retracts&quot; out from under the bus.
Also optional for standards, deluxes, westys, whatever.
Am I insane thinking I was going to find one for around 200$ is very nice
condition?

I've seen them for $150 over the past few years, working but needing resto.

My friend has one that was $50 (approx.) but they had to cut it open and
re-weld it to get it operational.

I know where one is right now, attached to a Bus, but I don't feel like
driving 20 hours to see if it's for sale.  :)
