The roof rack is the best place for it.  Don't worry about venting the
can, as they are made to be sealed at fairly high temps.  It isn't going
to get any hotter on your rack than it would in the back of a gardener's
pickup, sitting on a black plastic bedliner.

Don't forget to tie it down securely!  Don't fill it to the brim, leave
a quart or two of expansion space in each can.

&gt; I've got one of those plastic, 2 gallon gas cans that I'm gonna fill up and

&gt; thinking that the roof rack will be the best place to carry it while full.
&gt; But should I worry about venting it at all since it's in the sun?
