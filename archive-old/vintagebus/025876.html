It could be worth the $700.  

What I would do is- hm okay- rust in outer rockers- are the outriggers and 
jack points in good shape?  front floor?  Where are you- where I live all the 
buses have rust in front floor and rockers unless repaired.   Often in 
outriggers as well.   A dent in the corner- sounds easy to strghten.   Holes 
cut in dash?   interior okay?  seat comfy?   steering decent?   Have tranny, 
no motor.  Any interior,or just front seats?   Missing any other parts that 
wiper motor and engine?    How long has it sat?     ANy idea of the tranny 
being good or bad?

BTW, I went to the DOL to transfer title the other day and now in this state 
you pay excise tax not on what you paid for the vehicle, but what the book 
says it is worth.    And this book says a splitty kombi in parts condition is 
worth $550.    In primo condition it's worth $15,500.   This book even lists 
Hebmullers.

Ambulance fans are rare.   dont feel bad your bus does not have them.

A couple of days ago I posted a &quot;opinions on 66 Bus&quot; on the type 2 
list.  Since that time I've found the Bus does not have Ambulance Fans.
So here's the info on the Bus and please give me your opinions on the 
price.  66 Kombi with rust in the left outer Rocker,  Some minor rust on 
the right Rocker, one very small hole that can be welded shut.  A dent on 
the right rear quarter.  Other wise the Body is in good shape, no rust or 
other dents.  It does not have wiper motor or a motor.  He originally 
wanted $800 but will take $680 (what he says he has in it).  Is it worth 
the $680.  I've done Body work in the past on a professional level so 
that's not a big deal.  I want a Bus for a daily driver and semi Custom.
