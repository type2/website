Subject: Innovative Garage Ideas!! And  tension on the list

Hey volks
Due to my limited garage space i would like a tool bench or at least a tool 
bench on wheels with shelfs and stuff to put tools. So one of my ideas was 
to have a 2ft by 4 ft box with a vise on one end. Also this is my Rant 
section. Volks Volkswagen people are some of the best people around. They 
car about others and are nicer and less &quot;Violent&quot; Lets keep it that way! 
After that Ebay Hell issue that came up the list has been tense. Take a 
chill pill and cool your Jets!!. Just lay off it if your upset or mad about 
something. &quot;Make peace not war&quot; And that was said by people who used our 
precious buses before you were around.
So take care of the Volksies and have fun with this madness.
