Don't bother with an auto parts store, go to an auto body supply store
(they're in the yellow pages).  They will do a lot better for you in
matching and mixing auto paints.  However, for the old VW colors you
want have to settle for a single stage paint like acrylic enamel unless
you're ready to pay big bucks for real Glasurit.

&gt; Ok, I've been talking to the local parts people and I've come to the
&gt; conclusion that most of them are idiots.  Can someone please help me. I'm
&gt; looking for a cross reference for the following paint codes into a base coat
&gt; clear coat system:
&gt; 
&gt; L380 Turquoise/L289 Blue white
&gt; L325 Mouse grey/L87 Pearl white
&gt; 
&gt; The only thing I've been able to drag out of them is that L380=8040 in
&gt; DuPont and L289=8033 in DuPont, but they said they cannot mix that kind of
&gt; paint anymore, and can't find a cross in a base-coat clear-coat system.
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone help me out?
