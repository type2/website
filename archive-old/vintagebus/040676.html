ADVICE, LEAVE THE BUS WHERE IT IS AND DON'T BUY IT IF YOU ARE THINKING OF
PUTTING IN ANYTHING OTHER THAT A 4C AIR COOLED ENGINE.
GO BUY A DODGE.
I didn't mind the thigh master post, but come on this is the &quot;vintage bus&quot;
list,
not the V-8 list.
HAPPY NEW YEARS!!!!!!!!

&lt;&lt; I remember reading on the RAMVA newsgroup a while back that someone  was

doing a tv show that shows how to install a vortec(i think) V-6 into a

bus(can't remember if splitty, bay..). I know the show was supposed to air

in January and I believe it was a 9 hour job. That is something you might

want to look at if you are considering that route. Hope this helps!

Subject: [VB] what to power my splitty with.



&gt; I am curious as to what would be the best option to power my splitty with.

I

&gt; haven't bought it yet, but the one I am getting has no engine and is a 62,

I

&gt; think. I Thought may be one of those fancy bored and stroked crate motors

&gt; you see in the VW magazines with the fancy Porsche fan. I am curious about

&gt; other options too.  I do have a little 2.8 liter GM v6in my back yard. I

&gt; have seen a bay window with a Toyota in it and I have seen a pic of a

Subaru

&gt; engine in one. Any advice?

&gt;

&gt; Thanks,

&gt;
