Hey Volks

Spotted this custom camper on one of my recent travels (I wasn't in my
Dormobile). This guy's bus really is his home ... and he always has covered
parking ;-)

This bus is apparently well known in Grahamstown and seems to be in use as
a touring camper. I bet he takes corners slowly, and note the custom hinged
doors made from the former slider ...
