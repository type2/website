Subject: Re:  [VB] Installing the ventwing &amp; latch - rivets?
To: jclark_at_supernet_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Joe, those are regular pop rivets, you may as well just go gt some pop 
rivets.
- - -  - - -
Bus Depot sells N 013 736 3-5, Rivet Set, To Install Vent Wing Latch, 5
pcs, 52-78 Beetle Sedan, 53-79 Bus -- has anyone ordered this part?  

I'm trying to figure the count: 2 rivets to hold the latch, 2 to hold
the tin raingutter piece, and one on the upper pivot?

Howdaheck does one install these rivets?  All I've ever used are
pop-rivets.

Thanks,
Joe
