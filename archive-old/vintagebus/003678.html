Both brackets (door and one with pin) on my '67 Westy match the interior Perl White. Don't know if this is original, but sure appears to be, as the paint is worn and chipped in places just like the rest of the interior.

&gt; &gt; What was the original color of the cargo door check strap mounting bracket
&gt; &gt; that screws into the cargo door?  Black?  Color of the lower portion of the
&gt; &gt; Bus?  Different for early Westies?  I'm at that point with the Westy and
&gt; &gt; inquiring minds need to know.
&gt; 
&gt; Just looked at my '67 Westy (feel's so good to say that) and the bracket on
&gt; the door is black and the strap is green, both worn and faded and orginal.
&gt; The inside bracket with the removable pin is the color of the interior.
