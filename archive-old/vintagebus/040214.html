On that note, I'll chime in.

No one (I know of) makes a rear safari for the '66/'67 rear window.  There
is too little demand and too high a cost for tooling.  I asked Wolfgang
about it, but unless there were some demand, they wouldn't produce them.
(Not to say, I can pay a higher cost for just one.) It appears that the rear
'66/'67 truck windows are larger than the previous and I think (uncertain)
that they are slightly different than the later ('68 up) trucks.

I know that Wolfgang makes a rear truck window safari (smaller type) for the
pre '66 truck windows but I am not sure of Bus Boys does.

I wanted to use mine so I could take longer items into the back of the
doublecab truck.  Just think.  With a front and a rear safari, I could slip
in 12'+ 2x4 from the lumber yard.....

So... if I can find a lot more people wanting the '66/'67 rear truck safari,
I might be able to persuade Wolfgang to start producing them.

I think there might already be rear safaris for trux; I know
Roger Nang came all the way up to Sacramento to hack the
rear window frame out of a junkyard single cab so he can give it
to a safari manufacturer as a template.  He explicitly needed
a '66/'67 window, 'cause they're different.

&gt; This would make sense on a bus but has anyone tried it on a Double Cab or
&gt; Single Cab. It seems you would be far enough away from the exhaust to not
&gt; be an issue? I love the idea of more ventilation but only if it can
