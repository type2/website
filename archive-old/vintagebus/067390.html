Subject: Re: [VB] Anybody have a good heater?

Let's see how much guff I get for this! Personally I
would leave your motor alone or go to a 1776cc. It's
nice to have the extra torque and all that but there
are sacrifices you have to make.
 First of all in order to reap the benefits of that
motor you HAVE to redo the transaxle, put in a taller
4th or remove the RDB all together.   
 Secondly, that motor will be much louder than the
stocker you have know. You have to run a header on a
motor that size with at least a 1 1/2 pipe, if you
don't touch the heads, bigger if shouldo. You shoul
hear my friends bug. 2275cc, dual 48IDA's and 1 3/4
exhaust. WOW! It doesn't sound like that big of a deal
but if you drive long distances a lot, it could get on
your nerves. It did mine.    
 There are other variables too, but money and time
being the most important. The bigger the motor, the
more it will cost. I am sure you have heard &quot;speed
costs; how fast do yoAhant to go?&quot;. Ahh, and time.
Tune-ups and maintenance are also &quot;enjoyed&quot; more often
with the ownership of a big motor even though they
generally do not last as long as a stock motor. 
 It's a personal choice though, so the decision is
yours. I just wanted to offer you my opinion.
