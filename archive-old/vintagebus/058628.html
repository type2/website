&gt;
&gt;This is the best response to this issue I have seen on the list.How about 
&gt;the vintagebus_dot_com VoA Sucks panel?
&gt;
&gt;I and other friends will be there getting the message out in our own 
&gt;twisted ways and where better to do it then their own front yard.
&gt;
&gt;There are also some VoA folks that are vintage people that are venting 
&gt;their frustrations at the office.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hey All,
&gt;I feel kind of responsible for starting this thread with my off hand remark 
&gt;that said &quot;if you want to boycott VWoA's actions, then blow off their show 
&gt;and come to ours&quot; so I feel like I want to add another 2 cents and a 
&gt;possible CONSTRUCTIVE plan of action.  I received a letter from the 
&gt;secretary of MVVC in response to my initial post, this letter was also sent 
&gt;to the lists.  I'm sure most of you have seen this by now.  The secretary 
&gt;said they were not happy with VW's recent actions either but they are still 
&gt;having their show there due to committments even though they don't agree 
&gt;with them, etc. etc., etc.
&gt;So to members of the air cooled community and to the MVVC I want to propose 
&gt;this plan of action:  I assume there will be vendor space for rent at this 
&gt;show, correct or no?  If so, I suggest we take donations to rent a vendor 
&gt;space(I'll be the first to give!!) and recruit some volunteers to staff it. 
&gt;  Instead of selling stuff, The volunteers would be responsible for 
&gt;informing and handing out information and literature about what all VWoA 
&gt;has done to the air cooled community and the small businesses surrounding 
&gt;this hobby.  VWoA should be given no prior knowledge of this happening, and 
&gt;the MVVC could claim &quot;no previous knowledge&quot; to cover their own a$$es.  The 
&gt;large media presence at this show would be the key.  I would have to think 
&gt;that it would make national headlines when the press picks up a 
&gt;&quot;demonstration&quot; against VWoA at the show held at their headquarters! So 
&gt;everyone wins, MVVC and the charities they support get their share, and we 
&gt;all get the message out to a larger !
&gt;po!
&gt;pulation.
&gt;So, do we have any old hippies out there who have just been dying for a 
&gt;good old fashioned demonstration who would like to head this up??
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Peace, John Baker
