Subject: Cleaning glass &amp; Water from the Sky

&lt;&lt;(a friend) asked you about cleaning glass and you said to use cleansing
powder.  Is that true? &gt;&gt;

Dear Somebody (and the folks on the Mailing List),

Possibly.  I've used 'Bon-Ami' and other forms of NON-ABRASIVE cleansing
powder to clean glass, paint and machined surfaces.  (Actually, it's still an
abrasive, just a very fine one -- it polishes rather than abrades.)

But before you start 'cleaning glass' you need to know what's making it dirty
:-)

Wash your windows with a mild detergent, just as you would the windows of
your home.  Most 'dirty windows' are due to an oily colloid, like smoke or
fumes from engines... or cooking or stoves or...  whatever.  Break the grip
of the oil, the glass rinses clean.

If you have some form of solid material stuck to the glass you need to figure
out what it is.  Plain water works just fine for splatted bugs or droppings
&gt;from birds &amp; bees.  (Yep.  Even bees gotta take a dump now &amp; then.  To keep
their hive clean, they spread the wealth via air-mail.)  Here again, a bit of
detergent in the water will help -- a drop or two of liquid detergent makes a
quart of water 'wetter'.

If the solid material is tar or paint you might be better off removing it
mechanically rather than using a solvent or detergent.  They sell scrapers
for this but a razor blade has worked fine for the past hundred years.  And
still does :-)

Water, detergent, a razor blade and a little alcohol will take care of 99% of
your glass-cleaning problems.  The other 1% are usually chemical residues
which have bonded to the glass.  Vinegar, which is a dilute acid, will
usually take care of any chemical that bonds to glass but you have to be
careful of your paint and the seals around the windows.  It's not a good idea
to get dilute acid under the seals.  Given enough time, it will cause rust.
This is where some form of POLISHING COMPOUND comes in.

If you want to win prizes at a car show, you would of had all your window
panes polished with cerium oxide or jeweler's rouge before they were
installed to give them that diamond-like finish.  But cerium oxide (or other
glass polish) can be used to remove minor pits, scratches and even some
chemical deposits.  (If you do much traveling in the desert southwest, you'll
know what I mean.)  If you get a little overspray on the glass, after
scraping off the bulk of it it's standard practice to use some form of
polishing compound to remove what the razor leaves behind.

'Bon-Ami', the old-fashioned stuff, used to brag that it made a fine glass
polish, containing no 'harsh abrasives', meaning it didn't have powdered
glass, sand or carborundum... stuff found in some very popular kitchen
cleaners.   Inexpensive and universally available, it the automechanic's
choice of 'glass polish' for more than fifty years.  But times change.
Modern household scouring powders often contain stuff you don't want any
where near your bus.  (Or your sink, for that matter.)

So read the label.  Unless it says it's suitable for polishing glass, don't
use it.

My wife says the local store no longer carries 'Bon-Ami' which is a shame --
I use it to scrub cylinders and stuff.  She brought me home some other stuff.
 (She don't let me go to the store alone any more :-)  But I can still buy
diatomatious earth and precipitated chalk and jeweler's rouge, which is
actually an ultra-refined form of iron oxide.  So I guess I'll be able to
manage.  But cerium oxide is a lot neater than jeweler's rouge -- use
jeweler's rouge, everything turns red including you, the bus, the neighbor's
cat...

You can buy cerium oxide from optical supply houses... and from J. C.
Whitney.  Whitney sells it as part of a glass-polishing kit, but they don't
put much of it in the kit.  Buy it from an optical outfit, you can get a
couple of pounds for the same price Whitney gets for a couple of ounces.
Buses got lotsa windows.

Of course, the best thing you can do for your windows -- especially the ones
in front -- is to take them out now and then.  Polish them up good, flat on
the bench.  And put them back in with a new seal... after you've cleaned up
the rust you'll find under the old one.

Is Clara still on the Mailing List?  If she is, ask her.  She lives where it
rains.  And I know she knows the trick about filling the void with with tar
or sealant because we talked about it one time.  The stock VW windshield seal
leaves a small void right down against the rim the seal locks over.  Water
gets in there and, given time, eventually causes rust.  Once you get rid of
the rust, the best way to keep it from coming back is to deal with the cause,
which calls for filling up little void.  Ask Clara, she'll tell you how.
(Rains all the time up where she lives.  Rains down here (southern
California), we all just skid off the road, lay there looking at it, water
coming right outta the sky :-)

PS -- Since this is the second message this week about cleaning windows I'll
assume you folks are having a contest or something :-)
