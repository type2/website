Subject: Popout window seals; USING youre popouts!?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I just changed the popout window seals in my 57 bus.
Am I EVER going to be able to use my popouts AGAIN!!!????
Any suggestions for making them open/close correctly.
Right now they are so tight I think Im gonna break the spoon latch off!
