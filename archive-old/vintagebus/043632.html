&gt;I just brought my new '66 Standard home last night, My first splittie!!!

Congratulations, and welcome!

&gt;Anyway, after finally getting it started, and letting it run for a few 
&gt;minutes, there was a big oil puddle under the center rear(toward the front
&gt;of the bus) of the engine.

The only thing I have to add to the good responses you've already gotten
is that front is front - the flywheel end of the engine is the front of
the engine and the crankshaft pulley end is the rear.  It helps to keep
everyone on the same page.

Check out vintagebus_dot_com for good tech articles and an archive of
recent messages (a more complete one is in the works).  There are also
*color* wiring diagrams for your splitty (and your bay-window, and your
Super Beetle.)  While at vintagebus_dot_com put your serial number and 
M-codes (from the plate on the wall behind the front passenger seat)
into the Registry for all kinds of interesting info on your Bus.

Since you have 2 other VWs you probably have the Muir &quot;Idiot&quot; manual 
already, which will help with the '66.  The definitive manual for your
Bus is the '63-'67 &quot;Bentley&quot; manual, a reprint of the factory manual.
It's available from the usual suspects, including some of the fine
folks on the list.  Also, check out the Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation
Project at http://home.cwru_dot_edu/~agw4/docs.htm .  The main item here
is a completely scanned copy of a '58-'67 Bus parts manual!

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
