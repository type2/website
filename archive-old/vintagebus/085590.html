Subject: Re: [VB] LED bulbs

Has anyone done the &quot;engineering&quot; (LOL) on the tailights for the pre-'62 bus
taillights?

My friend has a set of LED replacement 1157 bulbs in his Vanagon Syncro and
they are fantastic!  Very bright and with the lack of heat, much better for
the lenses.  I will eventually buy a set of those for my Syncro.

The 62-71 buses have bad enough taillight illumination, but the pre '62
buses are plain unsafe on the roads.  I drool over the LED lights that the
MTA buses use, if only they were bus-sized!  Every time I see a lighting
catalogue, that is the first thing I look for.

&gt; DON'T PUT LED REPLACEMENT &quot;BULBS&quot; IN YOUR EXTERIOR LIGHTS.
&gt; Yes, I know there are production cars with exterior LED lighting.  In
&gt; this case, the LED/reflector/lens assemblies have been ENGINEERED FROM
&gt; THE GROUND UP to work together and produce the correct light output at
&gt; all viewing angles, input voltages, etc.  Slapping an LED-cluster lamp
&gt; in a reflector that wasn't designed for it does not count as
&gt; &quot;engineering&quot;.
