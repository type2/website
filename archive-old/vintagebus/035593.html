if you go to http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/ and look under
barndoors....Everett has a copy of his letter from Wolfsburg in the section
about his 54 single. His letter lists 8 m-codes for that bus alone. There
were lots of m-codes used through all the years. Its not as simple as &quot;do I
have double doors?&quot; its more like &quot;did I have a special air cleaner?&quot;  &quot;was
I supposed to have the tilt canvas?&quot; ...all used in the process of an
authentic restoration.
 --  -- 
yeah- that letter confirmed that the air cleaner I had was right for my bus, 
not from a later one- the oil bath version was standard not till 54, and the 
one I had is nice and evidently orginal to the bus, and also confirmed the 
engine had the right # on it.    I had a mere 3 m-codes.

Also the engine # thing-  some places used to register cars with the engine 
#, for a vw that gets a engine transplant  but later someone buys the bus and 
the title number is nowhere on the car this can be a real problem.  So 
official documentation of that engine number (the number on the title) being 
with that particular car (by the vin) can be really useful to get the VIN on 
the title to sort out paperwork.  A friend of mine is going through this with 
a bus he bought from a state that used to register vehicles to the engine 
number, and to get a title in his state he has to jump through these hoops to 
get the paperwork sorted.
