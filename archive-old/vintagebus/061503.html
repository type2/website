&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; My name is Joan and I'm a legal assistant at a law firm in Texas. I saw
this list and was wondering if Type 2 is a registered trademark with VW.

I doubt it because there are a lot of things out there called &quot;type 2&quot;.
Do a Google search on the string &quot;Type 2&quot; and you'll get over a million
hits  Even VW doesn't have enough lawyers for this fight!

VW never used the phrase &quot;type 2&quot; to identify its vehicles to the public,
so no confusion can result from other people using the same term.
