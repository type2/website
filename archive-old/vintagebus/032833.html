I've been getting the final kinks out of my '67 westy and am working on
my &quot;rebuilt&quot; steering box. I can get it pretty tight but the box seems
to be stiff when turning left, that is it drags and stays when I turn
the wheel left but is smooth and returns to center when turning right.

In one of my manuals it describes adjusting both by the screw and also
by shims on the lower cover, where the horn wire comes out.

Any one know of a source for the shims and gaskets for this cover?

A good steering gear box should be adjusted with the wheels pointing forward,
jack it up off the ground.  Tighten the adjustment sscrew in till it drags a
bit in the center, then back it off just a hair so it just barely doesn't
drag.   From what I read in the WV workshop manual (which is now available
from Bently) it says the tightest part should be in the middle.   Who rebuildt
it?   Give them feedback.   Hope this helps.   That VW workshop manual is
great for specifics on the splitty.   Yes, engine and brake type stuff is
covered by many manuals, but body and steering stuff is done so much better in
this book.  Bently and VW did a great service by reprinting it for public
availability.  Take advantage of the information.
