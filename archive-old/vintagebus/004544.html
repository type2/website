&gt; The first is ownership.  Who &quot;owns&quot; the content that we all provide?  I
&gt; would think that the closest claim would have to be the guys that keep us
&gt; running on a daily basis.  But since this archive is an agreagate
collection
&gt; of litterally hundreds of individuals, what claim would there be to that
&gt; ownership unless everybody who contributed over the years knew up-front
that
&gt; they waived the ownership of their post by joining in the first place; the
&gt; infamous &quot;fine print&quot;.
&gt;

That is also a question I had. Don't you have to claim ownership for a
copyright to be valid? Is something you write owned by you if you don't
apply for a copyright?

&gt; The second would be liability (the part that lawyers salivate over).
&gt; Assuming that &quot;ownership&quot; could be pinned down to an individual, are they
&gt; responsible; financially and otherwise; for bad advice given?  As an
example
&gt; I have a problem concerning my engine loosing oil.  Billy-Bob (in a post
&gt; found in the archive) says not to worry about it and my engine blows up.
&gt; Would the &quot;owner&quot; of the archive be responsible for replacing my engine
(and
&gt; the zillions of dollars in pain and suffering that a lawyer could try to
&gt; get)??
&gt;

Good point. What jury would award damages to someone who posted a message
and had it republished without permission?

Any other opinions? BTW, I think the childish, smart-ass responses are
particularly helpful.
