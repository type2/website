Subject: Exper. w/ speedometer repair shops?

Hey folks.

Has anyone had any experience with any of these speedometer repair shops?
The odo on the '66 stopped working last monday (or sometime between the
fillup prior and monday...).  I've been inside enough of'm to know I'd
rather not do it myself this time.

I've talked to three shops, all in cali.

Palo Alto Speedometer
North Hollywood Speedometer
United Speedometer Service (riverside)

Does anyone have any experience with these guys?  They all sounded
perfectly willing to work on a bus speedo, and sound like they know what
they're doing.  Rough price guestimates range from 125-145$.

Any other recommendations are welcome.  (..and if they're in Florida
that's even better!:)

thanks.

...david
