Buying parts is probably one of the most important aspects of bus
ownership - without buying parts, you wouldn't have much of a bus to drive.
If these were Plymouth Neons or some such new car, where one could
tango into the dealer and buy brand new _____, then yes, it would be a waste
of bandwidth.

The most important thing you need when buying parts is *knowledge* - it's 
more important than the greenbacks, pounds, yen, ___ that you buy
said parts with.  Ebay and swap meet vendors (with rare exceptions, like E&amp;B)
are not going to provide this knowledge, as it's counter to their goals.
I've been sold the completely wrong, expensive, part MANY times by
unscrupulous vendors.  I've probably taken it bending over more than some 
convicts.  Like $100 for &quot;bus&quot; reflectors that probably came off of a
bicycle or something.  

I've seen the words &quot;NOS,&quot; &quot;rare&quot; &quot;HTF&quot; and my fave &quot;rarest of 
the rare&quot; - misused so many times I hardly notice any more.

Benders (sic) love to hype their goods to the unknowing, to make a fast
buck, and ebay is a breeding ground for such types.  If we expect to keep 
our buses on the road, and remain solvent at the same time, we need to 
know how to weed through the bullsh*t.  This list is one of the few 
resources to that end.

Hey, I get burned out on trip reports, but I just move on to the next
message.  As long as the discussion is civil, and VW-related, people
can rattle off about whatever they want.

&gt; This list produces a lot of traffic with just real VW stuff. Is it really
&gt; necessary to comment on every single little bus part for sale? If someone
&gt; buys it, it was worth it to them.  Why ponder it and every sale to death? I
&gt; am begining to think we need a vintage things for sale list. I guess from
&gt; here it seems to get old fast.  Jim
