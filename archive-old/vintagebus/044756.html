Subject: 66 21 window for sale (free delivery)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi. My name is Kerry Cooper, I'm new to the list. ( 3 year ABC member) 
I live in Albuquerque. I've just bought a 62 DD WT Panel. I'll be driving out 
to tow it home from San Francisco bay area with in 10 days. I must sell my 66 
Deluxe 21W walk thru and thought that maybe someone along the way 
(Northern California, Northern Arizona) might need a 21W for $2,500.00 
delivered for freaking free. What a great deal if I do say so my self.
The bus can be viewed at Everett's cool &quot;VWPLANET&quot; site. click on type II 
photo ads.
Comes with both deluxe bumpers, front seats, (no Middle seat),good rear seat, 
no interior panels, nice head liner, no broken glass, deluxe cargo mat, 
Deluxe clock &amp; speedo, complete top assembly with a brand new canvas top(not 
installed), extra deluxe cargo doors, extra deluxe hatch, correct interior 
door handles (all 4) complete set of out side trim including lower rocker 
trim.
 no gobs of bondo or signs of major impact. Fair tires on 15&quot; rims_dot_complete 
jail bars.
The 21W is in need of rust repair, Rockers, battery pan, cargo sill, 
outriggers, jacking points,L&amp;R 1/4 cab floor, Frame rails are solid. Body 
good, no rust any place on top or around any windows The bus does run and 
drive pretty damn good. all doors are tight with no loose or broken hinges, 
has all ouside door handles. Pretty much complete. 1600sp with correct air 
cleaner. 
So if anybody knows of somebody looking for a bus like this then Email me or 
you can call 1-505-345-9362 But act fast because  I doubt it'll last the week 
end.

Thanks 
Kerry
