&gt; Hi all
&gt; I hope this isn't stretching the issue, but I am
&gt; looking for lawn chairs to
&gt; carry in My VW Bus!
&gt; Would anyone have seen the Chairs that fold into a
&gt; carry bag, specifically,
&gt; they are the TRIANGLE shaped ones that have arm
&gt; rests, with Beer holders,,
&gt; also they have a foot rest,  and as they are
&gt; triangular, the top is a head
&gt; rest. 

I got sumthin similar at the Army-Navy store... Has a
carry case &amp; all:)
