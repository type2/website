I'm also interested in the '63 mounts too.  If someone knows this info,
please post it public so we can get it in the archives.

Anyone know the part number for the 65 Bus transmission mounts ?  I called a
local shop and they told me it was 113301263 and made a statement that it
was the same as the bugs.....I'm a little weary.
