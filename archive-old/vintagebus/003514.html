Clara Writ:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
there is one point on which I disagree - she herself does not become insane-
it is more than the fellas who become &quot;freaked and generally miffed at the
world in general&quot; are the ones who become insane.   She walks (drives the
bus)
around, enjoying life and fahrfurgnugen (sp?), throwing off rays which may
cause insanity in others who are susceptable to such things....
particularly
people who refuse to see things that are right in front of them.       They
should get over it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, I would have to disagree with that one, at least on the basis of the
majority of cases. (I am sure there are those of us out there of the male
persuasion that ARE rather intimidated by women into Busses/Cars in
general).  In the case of my own personal experience and those of my
associates this could not be further from the truth.  Give me a Kewl woman
who will be out there adjusting valves and swappin' motors over any
super-model type any day of the week!

What I am talkin' here is not insanity in relation to busses or VW or any
other car matters, I'm just sayin that they can be quite insane in general
&quot;psycho bitch&quot; (pardon my French) type of ways.

While these insane types can be very polite and friendly, and VW
knowledgeable, there are just certain qualities which seem to emerge when
the boyfriend/girlfriend relationship begins.

There is no doubt all us guys ARE insane.. we have to be just to be in this
hobby!  You have to admit, most bus drivers dance to the beat of not just a
different drum, but an entirely different band!  What I am pondering here is
the quality of women who go insane AFTER their introduction in to busses.

Protect me from the things I want.    Leave now, sleep when you get there.
