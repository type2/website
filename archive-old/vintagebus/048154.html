&quot;I saw 2 different kinds of deluxe coathooks. One kind
was sort of pointy on the ends, and another more
rounded on the ends. Which is early and which is late?
What year did they switch?&quot;

The more rounded one is Barndoor thru 58 ish,the other one is 59 ish
thru 61 maybe 62.....I think

I second what Mark said, and just add that the metal coat hooks were used 
until the end of the 63 model year


and the question abut grab handles was confusing, not sure what was asked,, 
and for what year bus
