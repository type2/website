Got another tip about a couple of 1958 standards that have been parked
outside a house that looks like it should be condemned.
I was bored on Sunday so my roommate and I decided to head south (location
not disclosed on purpose, he he) to see if this tip would pan out.  We
drove around for about 20 minutes until I spotted 2 buses overgrown in the
backyard of what I guess you'd call a house.  As I walked up to the rear
of the buses the first thing I noticed was that both rear bumpers were
missing (of course) and that only one of them had an engine.  The
interesting thing about the engine was that it was VERY clean, and it
didn't have the exhaust on it and the exhaust ports were spotless!  You
guessed it, never been fired!  My guess is that the owner built and
installed the motor and then became very ill or maybe even died.  There
was even an NOS muffler on the front seat.
As I walked around to the front of the buses, my hopes diminished as I
realized that the buses were actually '59s or '60s (don't get me wrong, a
'59 or '60 would be cool too).  Both buses had front bumpers and all the
glass, most of the handles and most of the interior.  The bus with the
motor had a descent &quot;60's&quot; interior with shag carpet and sparkley blue
vinyl on the seats and could be a driver pretty darn easily, but the other
bus is beyond help with a bashed roof and rear end.  
I still need rear wheel wells for my '57, so I thought the beat-up bus
would be a perfect donor.  There is also many other good parts that can
lend themselves to other projects.  Anyway, I'll get some pics up if I can
close a deal with the lady. 
BTW, there were also countless bug fenders, motor parts, trannys, and even
an OLD Ghia up on the roof of one of the sheds on the property.
