Subject: Where is Mr.VW now?

I spent the better part of the afternoon trying to figure out how to present
some pictures that Mr.VW sent me and decided the slide show format would
work best.  It takes a hell of a lot longer to generate the html but the
rewards are far greater.  For your enjoyment I have  about 30 photos in
slideshow format detailing Jeremy's latest project and a little info about
what he is doing now.  Please enjoy yourself by going to:

I've crossposted this to the vintagebus group as well as many of us remember
him while he was on the list.  I know I'll never forget his daily postings
and seeing that Mr.VW-authored message come over the list. :-)

Enjoy!
