Subject: Re:  bolt pattern for drums and discs
Message-ID: &lt;55740c52.2458d978_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Does anyone know what year the bolt pattern changed for the drums and discs
post '67?  I am thinking of changing the front brakes on Fritz to discs and
keep the rear stock.  I just spoke to a very knowledgable VW mechanic who
 -- -  - -
the bolt pattern changed when they switched from drum to disc brakes.   If
you put disc brakes on the front it will take the later style rims.   You can
get adaptors so you can use the wide 5 pattern , though.   The idea of
redrilling rims sounds a little unsafe to me.
