&lt;&lt; Hi,
 I have a '66 Westy and after changing the shocks I realized that the 
 front axle was seized on the drivers side. I havn't taken it to the shop 
 yet to diagnose, but I have been told king pins (link pins) and/or 
 torsion bars may cause this. Can I free this up myself or is this a 
 major pain in the . . .
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Bob,
The good news is that you can dissassemble and clean one side of your front
suspension in one day easily.  The problem is that most likely you are going
to have to make a list of parts that will have to be replaced while you have
it apart.  Regrease everything and reassemble it if you need your bus to drive
for the next week or month while you get the new parts in.  Also buy the
Bentley reprint of the pre-1968 bus VW shop manual will help you now and in
the future to keep VWing safely.   Eric &amp; Barb
