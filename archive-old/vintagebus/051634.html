Subject: Re: [VB] noisy heater &amp; BBB VI

I picked up a set of these from Ronnie a month or two ago.   Been working 
great for me!   I had to trim about 1/2&quot; off mine to get them to fit.

And regarding BBB VI,  I would like to thank Ronnie, VWHoward , the London 
Bridge Bullis, and anyone else involved for another excellent show! My 
daughter and I had the best time, and i actually broke my dry spell in the 
raffle.

Later,
Beto &lt;--------that's the correct spelling  =)
