Subject: RE: [VB] OT - Thing hard luck story

I attribute this thriftiness to my wife... Who beats me senseless every time
I bring up the topic of dumping money into the 911 ;)  

I think we can all relate to this story.  If I were single, oh man, I cannot
even imagine how much I would be spending on car stuff!

Luckily she likes the 911 and lets me play with it.

Your willpower is to be envied!   I'm always &quot;upgrading&quot; and/or
subsequenlty breaking one piece or another.

&gt; I probably have a whopping $300 in it over two years.  Granted it is not a
&gt; DD...  I would like to dump a lot of money into it though :)
