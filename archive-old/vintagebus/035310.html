Hi Rick,
True, but also we just needed to get some shelters up now, rather than later. 
 We have been thinking of modifying these shelters, but the only steel 
material we would use would be zinc plated to prevent corrosion problems.  
Which if you weld means one has to wear a resperator to keep the zinc fumes 
from damaging your lungs.  Has anyone used one of these to do this sort of 
work?  We will check with our local welding supply shop about this.      
Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb
