&quot;...This is an issue of particular interest to me, for two reasons.  Like
all Type 2 camper owners I'm always interested in supplemental heat sources
that can be used to extend the camping season....&quot;

I've often wondered if it would be possible to utilize the external
electrical outlet on westys to run a BN4 or similar heater.  Anyone ever
contemplated tying a gas heater into this power source to run while the
vehicle is parked?
Just a thought.
Mike
