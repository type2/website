&lt;&lt; So i guess i just put these on the wire going btn my wiper switch and my 
wiper
 motor, or should they go between the fuse box and the switch, or does it 
just not
 matter (so long as they are not between the wiper motor and the wiper - 
jk)?&gt;&gt;
Hi Jdd,
Correct, either way will work.  Though for those who are running the 
solinoidmechanical clock they then like to install the resistor in front of 
the wiper switch.  That way they can run the positive wire to the clock from 
the resistor to drop the voltage to the clock just a little.
  
&lt;&lt;So i guess ill remove my package try and take all of the wiper assemply 
right out.&gt;&gt;
For 1955-65 bus you really do not need to remove the package tray to remove 
the wiper motor.  If you really need just a tad more room you can just loosen 
the right side of the package tray.  We find though that the wiper motor can 
be uninstalled, moved over to the far right of the package tray, and with 
just a slight pull down on the package tray the motor will slide out.

&lt;&lt;Ive been playing around with the thing a lot.  Besides the noise the 
passenger side arm thingy that goes from the motor to the wiper keeps popping 
off, so i re-orient the bend in the arm thing and it'll work fine when i test 
it then as soon as it rains the arm pops off.&gt;&gt;
You may just need a new used passenger linkage.  It should be straight 
though, not curved, and that may be your trouble.  
  Before we cleaned, and regreased the wiper motor we has to shout over it to 
be heard in our panel.  Now we can speak at a normal level, and be heard 
clearly.
  While you have the wiper motor out make sure to take off the cover held on 
like a valve cover.  Clean all of the dust out of this armature area, and 
look for any signs of the armature rubbing against the insides of the field 
coils.  Running the 6 volt wiper on 12 volts results in too much torque for 
the wiper.  Causing the bearing bore that the armature rides in to wear to 
one side.  Result is that soon the armature locks up against the field coils, 
and burns out because it can no longer turn.
