Subject: Any list members in Corpus Christi area?


Hello, All...
   I have a request from a good friend of mine who is stationed
in Corpus Christi doing Uncle Sam's business...He just bought 
a very nice VW 411 and is wanting to find a reputable shop that
he can take it to for service/repairs while he is there. Any help
would be greatly appreciated as this is his first VW(!) and he
wants to keep it in good shape.
   (He told me that he called the VW dealer there and talked
to the parts guy...  he said he knew he was in trouble when
he said 411 and there was silence on the other end of the line.)
   
   Bus content...   bought a sandblasting pot and I am going to
try my hand at blasting window frame areas...wish me luck...

Many Thanks!
