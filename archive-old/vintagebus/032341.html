Actually you are incorrect!!!!  Gas vapor + flame = boom!  I have welded on 
a topped off tank before with out any problem.  Or you can remove it and 
have it scrubbed and dried (Process takes the better part of a day!).  When 
its clean and you can no longer smell gas.  There shouldn't be a problem.
