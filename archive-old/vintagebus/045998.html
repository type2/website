===============================
When I first started driving my 65 westy, I too was plugging up filters like 
no tomorrow.  I ran one before the fuel pump, and then one between the pump 
and carb.   I changed them almost daily.  I had to clean the carb twice, and 
the pump once.    I would get severe hesitation problems, and even have to 
disconnect the fuel line from tank to pump, and blow through it towards the 
tank to dislodge the crud a couple times so the engine would get fuel and I 
could get from point A to point B

The source of this all was little bits of crap in the tank.  I had previously 
taken the tank out and dumped stuff  (mostly rust) out of it, as the bus had 
been sitting for at least three years when I got it.   

The solution to this was to sew a chunk of a speaker magnet in a little bag, 
attach it to a wire clothes hanger, and hang it down the fill pipe into the 
tank, the the top end hooked so it did not disappear down the tank neck.   
Instantly the filters stopped filling with particles, and more importantly 
the horrible hesitations went away.   I would take the magnet out at the gas 
station, and hang it from the roof rack.  By the time I was done filling and 
paying, the cloth bag would be dry, I would knock the rust particles off and 
put it back in the tank.   By a month of round town daily driving it was 
clean (I dont remember exactly how long). 

this is one of those easy, cheap, and low input solutions that people really 
dislike.   I have seen people pshaw this concept in favor of buying a new gas 
tank, which is a much more expensive, and labor intensive solution.

To satisfy this latter group of people, I will now offer this special 
magnetic gas tank rust remover at a temporary low low price of $299.95 plus 
shipping and handling.  Instant results.  Call now.  Don't wait.  It slices.  
It dices.  Look at that tomato!!!  Use only as directed.  Not intended for 
children under the age of 3.  Offer expires soon.
