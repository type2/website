 can you explain a little more clearly how you insulated your floor, and kept
 water out...i just replaced the original floor in my ez camper.
 not the metal pan just the linoleum type stuff that was mounted to masonite. 
 I put a slightly larger piece of flooring in last august, it already got
 soaked, and warped. I used masonite that was hardened on both sides instead 
of
 just one. I am doing this again, but don't feel like having to replace it
 every 6 months....
 
 suggestions please?

Hi Kevin;
Before installing the &quot;sub-floor&quot; use an oil based primer to coat it, be sure 
to coat the edges. Coat it twice, after it dries install it &amp; then on the 
door edge apply silicon sealer, smooth that out. Install floor of choice.
