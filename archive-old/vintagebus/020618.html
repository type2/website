I was asked by a friend about the box in this photo:

http://onearth_dot_com/images/westybox.jpg

Does anyone know what it is?  This is a RHD model, so
I believe that the cabinet on the right is a cooler,
or is this one also? in addition?

Yet another thing of which I know nothing.  Do you
think that when we learn everything, we no longer have
need for this mortal coil?

Thanks in advance,

JP
