does anyone have knowledge of the difference between
&quot;asphalt roof tar&quot; and &quot;plastic roof tar &quot; ?
i&quot;ve quizzed local roofing suppliers as to this and not
received a difinitive answer. is it simply a  confusing
label problem, or is there a different mixture/base ?
local opinion has it that the &quot;asphalt&quot; mixture is more 
watery, while the &quot;plastic&quot; mixture (label indicates
asphalt petroleum, but not specific ingredients) is
thicker- label also indicates superior adhesion wet/dry
application over conventional &quot;asphalt&quot; product.

as regards vw glass sealant, has anyone considered
conventional professional auto-glass urethane sealant ?
there is a gooey tube and also a  &quot;rope&quot; bead in varius
diameters, and  many more products specifically 
designed for these kind of problems .
