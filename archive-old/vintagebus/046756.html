&lt;&lt; today's problem tho is the unavailability of paint - it appears that it is
 not possible for me to obtain mango green and sea gull grey in canada - (i
 must confess to not being completely excited about mango green anyway) -
 but if anyway knows of where i could order it from in the US please let me
 know. &gt;&gt;
Hi, 
You can find parts of your bus with clean unsun faded piant to have a paint
shop match the colors.  Mango green &amp; Sea Gull grey are a great looking
colors.  We have a 1963 KG with the Ruby red and black original color paint
that it came with from the factory.  Seems everybody paints thier KGs this
color and sometimes we wish that our was not the original colors that it
was/is due to this.  For every once in awhile we see a stock colored VW that
was not the most common paint and really enjoy seeing something different.
