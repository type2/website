As always every first Wednesday (Unless a major Holiday or right next to one.)
of the month this club meets at the Round Table Pizzia Parlor just South of
the Northgate Mall in N. Seattle starting about 7 PM.  Hope to see you local
bus volks there.  If not this time then mark this event on each month of your
calender to give yourself a reminder for the future.  Eric &amp; Barb
