Theoretically possible (think about how centrifugal-advance

Yes.  Starters tend to either experience infant mortality (usually
just after being put in, as yours' seems to have done), or lasting
quite a while before anything goes wrong.  Poorly-done rebuilds often
result in the infant mortality case occurring.  Can you turn the
starter by hand?  How much side-to-side movement is there in the
shaft?  I've seen a lot more bad rebuilds than good ones, which is why
I always buy new ones.  It's just not worth the hassle otherwise....

That, or the engine's seized.  You've shown that's not the case, so
bad starter is the correct diagnosis.

In which case, they aren't honoring their warranty, and you take them
to small claims court.  If they don't show up, you win by default.

I would call this a &quot;warning sign&quot;.

What oil does at very low movement rates is vastly different from what
it does at high rates.  Unless it's tens of degrees below freezing,
you'd probably never notice drag from thick oil when turning the
engine over by hand.  The starter, trying to spin things at several
hundred rpm, will notice it a *lot*.  However, at 90 degrees
(presumably Fahrenheit), assuming the engine itself was at that
temperature (it's in the shade, after all), there won't be any
oil-thickness issues.  Well, I suppose if the oil's *really* dirty....

The solenoid actually pulls a fair amount of power.  That's why using
a booster relay helps, since it provides the power straight to the
solenoid.  It's possible to lose enough power due to the solenoid that
there's not enough left to operate the starter itself.  Doesn't sound
like that's the problem in this case, though.

I'd suggest double-checking that the gear on the starter is the right
one for the flywheel you've got (did the teeth on your rebuilt starter
get chewed up?), and getting your money back for the bad starter.
Then, buy a new one, and go from there.
