Well gang, I finally had my turn at having the plug in a 30/31 PICT give
out.  Mine is totally gone.  I started for work this morning and the van
suddenly started popping and missing, no power.  I pulled over and it would
rev to about 3000 no problem.  I opened the engine compartment and, the plug
was gone.  Having to get towork FAST, I put 3 lyers of duct tape over it and
made the trip.

NOW WHAT??????????
I don't know what is involved in fixing it.  Help.
