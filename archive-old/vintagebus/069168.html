&gt;Talk of Snap-on and Mac.  I don't doubt they are superior tools to
&gt;Craftsman.  BUT, for the hobbyist, it isn't practical to buy them.

Snap-On has an online store on their site.  I haven't used it, but it
seems to be fully operational.

&gt;BUT, if you happen to get a salesman and buy some tools, how do you
&gt;get broken ones replaced?

As far as I know the salesmen handle the warranty exchanges.  I'd
assume that if you're a professional mechanic and you break something,
a call to the salesman gets you a replacement pretty fast.  That's part
of what you're paying for when you spend the bucks for &quot;pro&quot; tools.

Standard disclaimer: I don't work for any tool company.  I have mostly
Craftsman tools, with some Snap-on, Mac, Proto tools that I inherited
from my grandfather.  I've broken a few Craftsman tools, but I haven't
managed to break any of the &quot;pro&quot; tools yet.
