Dylan;

How about turning them on the bars &amp; seats,
using adjustable straps to secure to the side gates.

Could work, any other idea's??


I've considered attaching fork mounts to some
heavy-duty magnets and
sticking them to the bed, but I can see lots of
potential problems with
that. Has anyone on the list carried bikes in unusual
or creative ways 
that
might be of interest?

Any input is greatly appreciated!
