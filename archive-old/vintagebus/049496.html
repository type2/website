Subject: Texas Trip and missing sub-hatch camper

&gt;I just got back from a trip to Texas for the Amarillo
&gt;VW club's tour to Palo Duro Canyon.

you mean i missed this by 2 days????    after i asked the list about going
to palo duro that week,  after i stopped in donny's bug shop (sic) in
amarillo last tuesday and NO ONE mentioned a vw club tour either time???

oh well - hope you had fun! we were eaten alive by cedar flies, deer flies,
horse flies, and 3 flies i couldn't find in my insect books   :P

i'll type up a trip report when i have time.

saw THREE busses in 2000 miles, and one of those was in a junkyard off 87 -
maybe ya'll were out at the canyon already  :)
