Subject: I stink at bondo

Yes, I have to admit it out loud.  I know the &quot;B&quot; word  has alot of
negative connotations, but when used, for the right purpose, it works
for me (a little dent on a nice flat surface).  I just can't get the
bottom of the Big V on the nose of my '65 to look right.  I took the
entire nose down to bare metal, and found a fair  amount of previous
filler in a few spots.  I have been able to get passable results on the
other areas by myself,  but the bottom section of the V is killing me.
The myriad of small dents from the previous fix I found after grinding
out all the filler are not deep, but I just can't get it right.  I need
to call in some help. I guess I'll begin putting out feelers within
family and friends for some kind of &quot;hired gun bondo artist&quot;.  Bus not
driveable, so how much do you think one of these outlaws should get for
coming out to finish this for me?  As of right now, I know of noone I
can think of to do it, so it will probably be a friend of a friend type
deal.  I hate to even consider this option, but if it took someone an
hour and a case of premium beer, I'm all for it at this point.  Once the
nose is done, bus is ready for priming.
