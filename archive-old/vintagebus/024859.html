Dear Eric and Barb,
I forgot to include in my post that I applied primer to the inside of my
bus, before I applied the rubberized undercoat. I thought about using
tar paper, but I found this
process better. It's been about 2 years and no rust no fuss. I guess if
you take care of the
rust before you apply    any   rustproofing preventitive measures you'll
be better off.

Cannon
