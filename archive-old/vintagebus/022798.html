Subject: 1965 Westy for sale
Mime-Version: 1.0

Please pass this on to your friends....we have bought a '68 Land ROver
battlefield ambulance to become our camper, so our beloved bus has to go.

1965 Westy, big top side tent, Roof rack, childs cot, 81,000 miles, third
owner, comes with the original engine we took out, it ran great, correct
serial number per VW. We did a month to Newfoundland and felt the need to
upgrade, so it now has a brnad new AS41 full-flow case, new long reach
SF-45 headed, Dp 1776, Strictly Foreign, dual Solex CW dowel-pinned crank
engine.

We changed the bus to 12v, halogen headlights, new radio, oil temp,
pressure and volt  guages. oil cooler and oil thermostat, new 27x8.5-14
tires all around, original paint, the camper has never been driven in the
winter. 

I would go anywhere in this bus. We did a 3500 mile camping trip this
summer to newfoundland, it is a joy to drive. We just decided we needed $wd
for our next trip north. The engine has sbeen run on nothing but Mobil 1
since break-in. Compufire ign. 

We are looking to get $9000. And we and the bus are in Connecticut.
thanks, Jim and Ann
