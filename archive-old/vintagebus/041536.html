&gt; Well, I'm looking at some of the 'new' Mexican engines, GEX seems decent:
&gt; Hyd lifters,unleaded heads,etc with 12/12 warranty for 1,199. Mofoco has
&gt; 'new' Mexican 1600DP for 1,350. Strictly Foreign has a new 1600DP for 1,259
&gt; with a 24/24 warranty and no core charge . These all sound pretty good,
&gt; warranty on the SF engine looks tempting. Seems like it would be wiser  to
&gt; go for the new engine since the prices aren't all that far apart. So... any
&gt; suggestions?

If GEX was the last VW supplier on earth, I'd buy a F*rd.

I've purchased two new Mexican engines from Ronnie at Old Volks Home.  I
only have 1000 miles on one and 300 on the other, but the engines came
exactly as advertised, packed in factory boxes and strapped to a pallet.
His prices are in line with the ones you've quoted.
