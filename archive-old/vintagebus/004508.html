Hey Jimski in Reno

When I changed the gear oil in my '65 camper I, because of water
contamination, I refilled the gearbox with diesel fuel.  Lifting one of the
rear tires off the ground, I put the car in gear and let the tire spin for
5-10 min. to dissolve all sludge type goo.  Then I drained the box and
refilled with 90wt. gear oil.  My tranny is really worn, but that procedure
did smooth out some of the shifting.  Thats my experience changing gear oil.
