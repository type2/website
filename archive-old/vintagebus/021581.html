&lt;&lt; I think for my bus I disagree! with the heater box, some part of the

and actually get a hold of the wing nut. I can touch it. But I can't get to 
it like the nut is disigned to be used. &gt;&gt;
Hi Rex,
Rereading the part above of your email it sounds like you are trying to reach 
straight up to the clutch cable nut.  Better to go about this by laying just 
in front of the right rear tire and putting your left arm just forward of and 
over the left axle tube and then back between the heater flex tube and the 
tranny center section to the nut.  Just went out and checked this info under 
our 63 SC with big bore 40 HP engine and doghouse cooler!  Turned two half 
turns in under a second.  Eric&amp;Barb
