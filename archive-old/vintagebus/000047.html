Hi Jon,
It would work if you have a machinists grinding table to do it right, or if 
you have someone with a lathe make a fixture to bolt the dead MC to it.  Then 
cut off the rest perfectly straight.  As for doing it by hand it can be done, 
but it would just take so long, and you would need the proper measuring 
tools.  Any tilt to it would result in wearing out the new MC sooner by 
pushing it's pistons slightly sideways.   Eric&amp;Barb
