Hi all,

Had a nice time out at Pomona. Lots o vendors. Some good
parts, some bad. The usual stuff. Got a couple of leads on a
passenger door for my 64. Eric said he has several and Jim
from TJ says he has a good one. Ronnie says he may have one
too. Looks like a trip to Phx. Bought some POR-15 to try
out. Will report later. Tried Ras-O-Nil for rust clean up
and corrosion protection. Left a piece of steel after
treatment in a dish of salt water for a week before any rust
became visible. Not too bad. May use it as a base coat when
I strip parts of the bus.

All for now.
Chris
