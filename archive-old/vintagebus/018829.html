&gt;I also have what looks like an old bosch 6 volt
&gt;coil wired into my wiring.   What is it there 
&gt;for (is it a booster for the old wiring?)

Is your bus 12 volt now?  It probably would have
been 6 volt originally.  If so, someone may have
wired that coil in series with the &quot;real&quot; 6v coil
(on the fan shroud) so they could keep running a
6v coil.  In other words, they ran two 6v coils in
series on 12v.  The only problem is that the added
one would tend to spark a little too when the main
one fires.

Here's another idea.  Do you have any anonymous
toggle or push-button switches in the cab?  An old
hot-rod trick was to wire a switch on the dash to
a second coil.  This coil fed one spark plug that
was installed near the tip of the exhaust pipe.
You jetted your carb to run rich (or put the choke
on) and hit the button...FWOOOOOSH an exhaust
flamethrower!  Don't try this at home, kids!
Anyway, you might connect a test light across the
two small terminals and have somebody in the cab
turn on the ignition and operate any unknown switches -
if one of the switches turns the light off and on
that may be what you have.

If you're sure it's a coil (a cylinder about 2.5&quot;
(6.5cm) by 6&quot; (15cm) with two small connections and
one big insulated &quot;tower&quot; in the center) then those
are the only two things I can think of.  If it looks
about like that but doesn't have the center big
connection, it might be a big capacitor (condenser),
perhaps added to support a stereo (only likely if
your bus is 12v) or in a misguided attempt to filter
generator whine out of the radio (6v or 12v).  What
markings are on this thing?
