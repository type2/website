&gt;   i gathered from bob maglioti's reply he was talking of 62-71 style (amber
&gt; topped and all). sure would be cool to have euro-styled small glass
&gt; assemblies. (hmmmmm....thinking....how to make them.....)
&gt;

Excuse my ignorance here, but wouldn't a &quot;Euro&quot; '59 have semaphores thus making no difference in the
tail light (dual filament) but rather a different turn signal switch (3 wire instead of 6 wire)
since there would be no turn signals to cancel when the brakes were used???
