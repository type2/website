I'm wondering if it's possible to put a late-model bus (68-79) rear seat in
my '59 Kombi? Has anyone ever done this? If I need to make modifications,
what are they? Curious 'cause I don't have a rear seat &amp; Loafs are much
more common around my parts.

the bottom half bolts in the same post barndoor splits and bays 55-79.    The
legs are slightly different though, but they will interchange.    

The back of the middle seat from an earier bay will fit a splitty.  The ones
that have the tab with the 10mm head bolts holding them work.  The ones with
the flip down clip things won't attach.  So find one that bolts in and you
won't have any annoying modification to do.   And the next owner, or you later
,with like it.  I know the 77 top part of the  rear seat won't fit, but I
don't know when the change is.
