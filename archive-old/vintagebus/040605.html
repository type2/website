So, if your traveling down the road and you see a bus broke down on the side
of the road are you going to stop and ask if they are a list member?  If
their not are you going to leave them?  I have had my information on the
AIRs list since it's conception and I have had one couple call me.  If I had
not been there to help them they would have been screwed.  They were not
list members but they were very nice people.  Maybe they will become list
members because I helped them maybe they won't but I feel that what comes
around goes around both good and bad.  I'm kind of an ass sometimes so the
more good I can do to offset the bad the better.  Sorry for the rant but I
like to keep things in perspective.

Ive edited my data to remove my telephone# from my listing. I
know someone could still look up so its a small protest.
Anyone who thinks the intent of AIRS was to create a public help line is
wrong. I KNOW because I was there. I will gladly entertain any listee and
if I see someone post an intention to travel to my area I will send them a
personal invitation along with my phone#.
Others, well they can email me and if I am able to, I will help.
I encourage everyone who signed up for AIRS to consider the
ramafications.
