Subject: Re: [VB] Type 4 oil cooler in a doghouse

Hi Arnaud,
Well, anything could be used to modify the shroud including chewing gum,  but 
welding is the only reliable way to go.  Try this website for some  images of 
the shrouds we modify:
_http://hometown.aol_dot_com/veewee111/index.html_ 
(http://hometown.aol_dot_com/veewee111/index.html) 
 
As you can see we add material to the dog house cooler housing on the  shroud 
and make the exhaust shell taper down so its outlet is still stock  size.  
Additionally adding length to the L-shaped cooler bracket and one  must weld the 
right side of the fan inlet or the inner/outer sheet metal  tends to spring 
apart leaving a gap when the shroud is cut up!!
