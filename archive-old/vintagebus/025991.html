The top speed of a T2 is what ever you get with WOT.

The air intake is a restriction and limits the amount of air
available for combustion and thus the power the engine can
put out.

VWs are made to run at WOT all day.

If you are overheating on a good engine, try uping your fuel
octain.

&gt; Howdy Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I have focused considerable time in the last 12 months on issue of engine
&gt; temperatures and highway/freeway cursing in a Split-window vintage VW bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I have experimented with two vehicles primarily, one is a 1963 with smaller
&gt; reduction boxes and now a 1967 with the larger reduction boxes.  The 1963 is
&gt; a Double Cab with associated light weight and the 1967 is a full Westy
&gt; package... considerably more weight.
&gt; 
&gt; In general, I really don't feel that the list presents LOW TOP SPEED as
&gt; _common knowledge_ and several threads come up that relate to the issue --
&gt; but we always seem to be avoiding THE CAUSE what is becoming obvious to me.
&gt; In many of these cases, we argue about gauges, overheating, and so forth --
&gt; yet I feel that we haven't given enough attention to the JUST WHAT IS TOP
&gt; SPEED issue?
