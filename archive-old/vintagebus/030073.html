Subject: King Pin bushes.

I am contemplating re-furbishing the king pins on my '65 bus myself.
Having spent a load on the new pins, bushes etc, I need some feed-back
on how critical it is to get the newly pressed in king pin bushes
reamed. Is this a no-brainer? Do I _really_ need the VW reamer?


Advise?

Simon.
