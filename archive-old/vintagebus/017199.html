Dear vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com, 

I have tried to call you on the Paltalk network but could not find you.  Therefore, I am inviting you to join Paltalk.  All you need do to install Paltalk is click on this link:

	http://www.paltalk_dot_com/download/0.x/pal_install.exe

Once you go to our link, you will need to agree to the license and download the Pal_install.exe file.  After downloading, run the file and Paltalk will be installed on your computer. Once you register, you will automatically appear on my contact list and I will appear on yours.

Using Paltalk, we can do all sorts of great things like:

	*Speak to pals for free anywhere in the world.

	*Video conference with pals using a webcam.

	*Create your personal buddy list.

	*Exchange pictures or documents instantly.  

	*Create Private or Public Voice Chat Groups 

	*Do all of this for FREE!

Speak to you soon on Paltalk,
Dawn Rodriguez (DawnJD13_at_aol_dot_com)
