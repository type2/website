   For stocker jetting check out the 30 PICT-3 in the bus listed in the 
 Without GuessWork manual in the obsolete documents website.  Just remember 
 the stock air cleaner for that year bus was one of the 1968-1971 type and 
any 
 pre-1968 bus air cleaner is going to cause it to end up running rich.

unless you use the custom modified air cleaner that has the 2&quot; intake for pre 
heat from a 68 kind of bay window welded onto it, so I can use the 2&quot; pre 
heat pipe, that was found at an Ariz swap for $2, brought by that guy with 
the DC from Colorado.  With this air cleaner the flap does not open as much, 
but these days warm air is good.   You can hang the air cleaner on  the left 
on the 40hp intake pipe off the triangle bracket, (with the clip things, not 
the screw on kind) and so use this on the earlier buses.  Look in the Bentley 
about using 1500 air cleaners on 40hp buses- they have pictures.

It would be nice to have a website with the information cross referenced by 
engine size, engine compartment and air cleaner.  sigh.
