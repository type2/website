There have been several things
&gt;that I've been trying to decide on for my 66.  Here is a list of my
concerns
&gt;and what I've decided upon.  .
&gt;
&gt;1)  IRS Conversion or not?

Jamie Wrote! NOT for me either.

&gt;2)  6v or 12v?
I have come to the conclusion that there is honor and
&gt;prestige in keeping the ol' girl 6v.  &lt;snip&gt;, then by god I'm going to
leave it alone.
&gt;Maybe I'm not a purist but at least the bus will be.

Jamie Wrote! I can't say anymore,,,,just believe your mother!

&gt;3)  What color would be best with a white-over-red combo?  .

Jamie Wrote! sorry. i think that is a personal preference, but my '62
was a red insert when i got it... I have been thinking that would be a
great color to go with some new red wall pin stripe tires! just like the
old mustang bicycles.
BTW NQ.  for me to go to texas, i go via
michigan,ohio,indiana,missouri,oklahoma,texas, if i remember correctly.
I met a young lady, world of outlaw driver, in virginia last
thanksgiving that was from North of Omaha. She was the 98 rookie of the
year.  16 yrs old!!! just thought i'd mention that for some nebraska
content,



my ICQ# is 4652936
