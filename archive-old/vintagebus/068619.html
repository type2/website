&lt;&lt; I am currently restoring a 57 double door and am looking for either a
 camper interior or interior building specifications (size, dimensions,
 etc. on how to build my own acmper interior).  I live in Portland OR, so
 if anyone has any materials, building specsm or knows how I could get
 them, please let me know.  I am not interested in any post 67 camper
 kits. 
 Thanks so much,
 Matt
