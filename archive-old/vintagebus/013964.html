It is NOT appropriate to post to the list from 3rd party sites, ie &quot;click here
to send to a friend&quot; crap
 
The correct way to do this would be to cut and paste the URL into an
email message from your own mail client.

These services are FREE because they make their money on advertising.
Now we'll probably be getting spam as well.

&gt; Greetings!

&gt; Janet SBCsecretary has an album of photos for you to
&gt; see using the FREE PhotoPoint photo sharing service.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is a message describing the photos:
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; I thought you'd like to see some pictures of all the fun we had on the Split Bus Club campout at MacKerricher SP in Northern Calif. We had 28 Splits show up. The weather was great the rain didn't start until the drive home on Sunday. We rode our bikes into Fort Bragg and spent some time at the local brewpub. The raffle was a favorite activity of many of the campers. If you ever get to Northern CA, make sure you connect with the Split Bus Club. WE CAMP!
