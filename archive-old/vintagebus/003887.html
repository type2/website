&gt;If anyone has an even better (cheaper) solution for voltage dropping fro a
&gt;wiper motor, please let me know.


Maybe not cheaper but check out http://www.acvwjyro_dot_com/acvwjy/6-to-12.htm
and hit your page down key once.

If you are like most VW nuts and are sitting on a ton of parts, try it.
I've converted the wiper assembly but haven't yet tried installing it.
