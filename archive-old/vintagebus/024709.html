Subject: Re: Driving in Snow (was VROOM, accelerator fixed!)

Hi Paul,

That's great you have a sump heater to offer Erik.

I'll probably get slammed/flamed/cursed by the resto freaks but, yes,
some of us drive our Busses in the snow and salt! It's the best
snowmobile I've ever driven. Yes, the salt takes it toll, but I got into
these things from a practicality standpoint, not for show. My Busses
have gotten me around in weather that has left almost every other
vehicle grounded.

As good busses are getting hard to find, I'm making more effort to wash
&amp; wax regularly and I'm thinking about other ways to help preserve the
vehicle. This will delay the inevitable rusting, but I haven't come up
with anything that will prevent it (short of garaging the vehicle and
keeping a second car for the winter). There are some things I'm going to
try with the next '65, if they work out I'll post them to the list. 

I will say that the Ghia is parked &amp; tarped for the winter.

As a consolation to the resto crowd, I typically buy busses that you
guys wouldn't touch, like my &quot;only rolled once&quot; '65 that I retired (cut
up) a year ago after driving it for 5 yrs. Oh, and I don't lower 'em...
I like the clearance.

To each is own, but these Busses were utility vehicles. They are going
to wear out or get wrecked if they are driven at all. Every time you
drive an antique vehicle, you are wearing out parts that are NLA, so you
do what you can and move on.

I say use it and enjoy it,

pd

&gt; Do you drive your bus in the snow ?  NO SALT in your neck of the woods ?  Do
&gt; &quot;they&quot; put down anything on the roads ?  I have been in Ohio too long !!!!  If you
&gt; hear the word snow in the weather .....all good VWs head for the garage.    I
&gt; drove my single cab year round from 1967 to 1971. I remember it doing well in the
&gt; snow but the salt sent it back to the earth .
