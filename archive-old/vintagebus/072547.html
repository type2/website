Subject: RE: [VB] more support for &quot;steering man&quot;

I saw Chris and his wheels at an OCTO a year ago.

ribs are rounded off on top more than OG wheels.
 
If Chris makes another batch, he's got one customer
for sure. I think having a nice wheel is key because
it's the thing you touch most on your bus. (unless you
live in L.A. then that would be your horn button)
