Hi Eric and vintage drivers,

    I'm using the air cleaner that Scat sold me with the carb. It's just one
of those that sits on top of the carb and filters through a thin fabric type
mesh. I like your idea of a preheat tube for the intake air.
  Has anyone in this group done that? Were you able to find anything off the
shelf to help with such a carb intake air preheat system? ....I  think I can
fabricate something if I can't find anything to buy.

Anyway,Thanks for the simple solution. Sounds like it makes sense to just
preheat the air before it enters the carb.

&gt; Hi Neil,
&gt; What kind of air cleaner are you using?  If stock to your bus you need to
&gt; find or fabricate parts to install a preheat tube to suck warm air from
one
&gt; of the rear cylinders.  This preheat tube is needed in any humid weather
in
&gt; temps lower than 70F.   Eric&amp;Barb
