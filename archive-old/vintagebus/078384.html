&gt;
&gt;When I turn ignition switch on, the dash gen warning light does NOT
&gt;come on, but the bulb and ground at bulb holder are confirmed good.

The generator warning light shouldn't have a ground at its bulb holder.
One side of the warning light is connected to +12 V (switched with key)
and the other side is connected to the thin blue wire that runs to the
regulator.  The regulator _grounds_ the blue wire to turn the light on.
One simple test is to unplug the blue wire at the regulator and ground
it to the body; if this doesn't make the warning light come on, you
have a broken blue wire, burned-out bulb, bad bulb socket, or lack of
+12V at the bulb socket.

If grounding the blue wire does make the warning light come on, plug
the blue wire back into the regulator and do what Eric&amp;Barb and Mark
said.

Good luck!
