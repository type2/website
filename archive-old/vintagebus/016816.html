Ah heck, with all of the house projects buggin me like
an unattended whistling tea kettle I tend to think of
OG as &quot;Out (in the) Garage&quot;. True to my middle age
crisis mode as of late my wife deserves to think of OG
as &quot;Old Grump.&quot; 
It's been awhile since I had the energy or inclination
to be anything close to a gangsta. Crap, when I think
of being down wid it, I think of my head on a pillow
and well deserved sleep. Driving real slow without
headlights? Probably a blown fuse and remaining
carborundum in my cylinders. ;-)

pretty fly for a &lt;middle aged&gt; white guy...
