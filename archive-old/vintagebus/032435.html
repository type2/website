First of all; Thanks to everyone who replied, I found the manifold I was 
looking for (gotta love friends with large stashes).

Secondly; I tried the clutch cable trick and it wouldn't go through (I even 
sacrificed a new cable ) so I switched to using the spring from a drain 
rooter. Got about 90% of the way through with that. The last 6&quot; or so was 
cleaned with a dremel grinding bit soldered into the end of the spring 
(should have started with that setup). I also found that pouring fuel 
injector cleaner into the preheat tubes and heating with a torch softened 
up all the left over bits . Of course after all that I find out that I can 
get a spare for a reasonable price, probably a good idea since I have no 
idea how much metal is left after my assault.

Thanks again

Ben
