Subject: 14&quot; bias ply white walls
Date: Thu, 31 May 2001 18:52:04 -0700
	charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;

I was at a local new/used tire place today and they had a set of 4 used
7.50x14 white wall bias ply tires.  The white walls are not in the best of
shape, definitely suitable for a driver, not a show Bus.

Anyone interested?  I could bring them out to OCTO if you're out there but
you would HAVE to buy them, no take-backs.  I'd prefer the money to be sent
to me first.

He said $125 mounted and balanced but this is definitely an all-cash
business so I could work on him a little, plus subtract the cost of the
labor work.

Later,
Everett
