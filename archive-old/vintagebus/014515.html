&lt;&lt; what happens to them? do they break? fall off? &gt;&gt;

Hi Bob,
They break from flexing which work hardens them, and corrosion over the 
years.  Best you remove the one you still have and duplicate it for both 
sides of that axle.  The front four clips are easily installed with two 
rivets each.  The later 64 (And 1963 only one ton suspension.) front clips 
are differant length from the ones used from 55-early 64.  The rears were set 
in a groove and the sides of the groove hammered down on the clip one per 
side on the rear.  The rear clips might be better installed with small bolts 
safety wired through the heads together to prevent them from backing out.
