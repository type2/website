Excerpts from mail: 26-Mar-99 Re:  DECKLID SIZES? by Claralw_at_aol_dot_com
&gt;
&gt; Is there a difference in size between a 63 decklid and a 67 decklid i know 67
&gt; is push button but any reason it won't Fit?  63 panel and 67 deluxe incase
&gt; your wondering.  Thanks Again!
&gt;  -- -  -
&gt; the size is the same but the latch has been changed for unknown
reasons.   The
&gt; 67 latch will not latch a 63 apron.   66 and 67 have a different apron
for the
&gt; push button latches.    so theoretically you could put the lid and apron from
&gt; the 67 onto the 63.
&gt;
&gt; now you won't be able to prop it up.   the 55-63 elbow engine prop was
dropped
&gt; in dec 63 in favor of the spring style one.   The spring on the 67 lid won't
&gt; find a roller on the 63 bus.
&gt;
&gt; I would look for a 59 - 63 engine lid for the 63.
&gt;

Off the main subject here but I was wondering if the 68-71 lids would
work on the 66-67's? How about the rear hatch?

Thanks,
RJ.
