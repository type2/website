&gt;
&gt;First off, I called CB to get the spark plug reference numbers for their
&gt;heads:
&gt;
&gt;Bosch - XR4CS [...]
&gt;
&gt;Now here's why I couldn't find them down here - they are
&gt;motorcycle plugs - 14mm dia. and a 3/4&quot; reach.

From Bosch's &quot;Automotive Handbook&quot;, 4th edition:

X - M12 thread
    1.25 thread pitch
    17.5mm across flats
R - resistor
4 - heat range
C - 19mm reach
S - silver electrode

17.5 mm is an odd hex size.  18 mm would probably work;
11/16 is a bit small at 17.46 mm and 23/32 is a bit large
at 18.26 mm.

I have found that when buying Bosch plugs at AutoZombie et
al, you must insist that they look them up by the Bosch
number (W7AC, XR4CS, etc.)  I was trying to match some
plugs for a BMW motorcycle and they kept insisting that
a number printed on the ceramic (682) was the Bosch plug
number, and whaddayaknow, they couldn't find it.  When
I talked them into looking up the W... number they found
it right off.

I hope this helps!
