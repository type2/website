Mr. Hedberg,

While I have no personal experience with this, I would point your attention
to a recent article in I believe, Hot VW's showcasing the type 1
transmission and suspension kit you mention.
I think it sounds pretty cool.

&gt; Bus Boys of Northern CA sells a lowered beam for Buses.  In order to
balance
&gt; the look they recommend, among others, the use of a 68 Type 1 transmission
&gt; for its durability in conjunction with their rear suspension kit.
 I am  curious on the Lists opinions, sans flames, on this.  My son and I
have some
&gt; interesting exchanges on advantages/disadvantages in doing this and I
would
&gt; love to hear from the rather extensive experience points on the List :-)
