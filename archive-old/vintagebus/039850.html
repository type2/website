hello list,

i am posting a query about if anyone of you were broken down on I-94 by fort 
custer (between Battle Creek and Kalamazoo) last week.  I was headed to Lake 
Michigan when  I saw in my rearview  a Splitty.  I was in My Hon_at_da doing 80 
in the passing lane so i had to make a 10 mile loop and get back east of the 
bus so that i could get over beside it.
NO one was at the bus and that was too bad because  I had all of my tools in 
the Hond_at_ because i am in the middle of switching axles on to a new center 
section.   It was a grey late model bigwindow(I think) westy splitty.
I could not wait around because I was already super late.  But it was not 
there the next day when I was coming home.

So I am sorry for whoevers bus that was but I wanted to let the owner know 
that i tried.

Domonic
