&gt; I should have been more clear. The 12V wiper motors have two speeds,
&gt; including one that is actually capable of keeping up with the rain, which
&gt; is absent on the 6V. I want the new switch because without it I'd lose
the
&gt; two-speed capacity.
&gt; 
This makes my head hurt!....... I'm running one of those seedy looking
inline resistors on my ex 6volt 62..... seeing as the only way a 2 speed
wiper switch can slow the speed down is by resistance (i presume it can't
increase voltage). So if i swap my switch for a 2 speed 12 volt but keep
the old 6volt motor, wont i gain from a six volt supply feeding at position
1 and 12 volt at possition 2? (or thereabouts)  unless of course i'm
missing something - could the resistance be somewhere else?

Glynn -
endlessly irritaded - by wipers that never run at the right speed. they run
like sloaths when cold then gradually warm up to a speed that misses the
glass.
