Subject: Re: [VB] repro pop-outs help...

&gt; Send them back.  All of the repro popouts I've seen were junk.  AFAIK,
&gt; there's only one maker of these stateside, sold thru various parts houses.
&gt; CE makes them as well, and I imagine theirs are better, but they're
&gt; also phat bank.

No jive?
