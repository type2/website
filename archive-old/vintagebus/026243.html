Subject: really long post about even longer haul

Volks,

I don't post often because I don't usually have much to report.  Today I do.
Now that my head is somewhat clearer...

This weekend I completed the longest haul of my life while retrieving and
delivering a '67 bus body, a trip of over 2000 miles, accomplished in 56
hours through 8 states.

This was the middle 'leg' of the project - when I am finished and all the
mileage is added up it will be more like 108 hours on the road for 5200
miles through 10 states.  No co-drivers - all solo.

Why do we do such things for these old cars?  It's hard to explain to family
and friends who have not been bitten by the air-cooled bug...;-)

Some of you may remember Richard Alexander of Lakeville, Connecticut posting
the news of his purchase of three '67 busses back in April.  One of the
three had already been gutted and sandblasted.  Some welding had been done,
and the body was clean and straight.  Since Richard had other projects ahead
of this, he offered it and parts for sale to the bus list.

Wow, I thought, I could really use a clean body for my project.  I own Doc
Ric's 'Sweet Magnolia' , a '67 deluxe hardtop walkthru purchased in 1997,
and had been planning to start restoring this to stock this year.  This is a
very complete bus (middle seat, all deluxe trim, driveable) but suffers from
nearly terminal cancer in all of the usual spots.  It won the 'Most in Need
of Restoration' award at Busses on the Blue Ridge III that same year.

But Connecticut is nearly 900 miles from Tennessee.  And the Appalachians
are between us - perhaps not as majestic as the Rockies, but real mountains
nonetheless.  And I don't own any 'heavy metal' to tow with, much less the
trailer to carry the body on.  But hey, there's always U-Haul, right?  How
complicated can it be to rent this stuff?

Those of you who have 'been there' - I can hear you laughing now...

Richard is a straight talker who doesn't mince words - after an exchange of
emails, he and I agreed on a price.  Since the purchase would have to be
made sight unseen, Richard very kindly posted extensive pictures of the bus
on his website.  As things turned out, the bus was everything he described
it was.  I am extremely fortunate and pleased to have met another of the
honest and trustworthy members of our ilk.

I started looking at U-Haul and other rental options.  Lots of places are
willing to rent a pickup, but will not permit towing.  Even if I were to
mount a rental hitch on one anyway, the daily mileage limit was 100 miles -
.40 per after that.  Nope, no way.  U-Haul would be happy to rent me a 17'
truck to tow with - very expensive and cumbersome.  They even offer an even
larger truck cavernous enough to roll the bus body right into, but the cost
was even higher.  The distance was too much to consider using their tow
dolly, and their car hauler really needs 'big iron' to pull it.  Like a Mack
truck or so it seemed.

Hmmm...sort of like 'ya just can't get there from here'...

I ended up borrowing a van with the specified Class III hitch and renting
the U-Haul car hauler, a 2000lb aluminum bridge on wheels - just to carry a
1200lb bus body.  The math clicked home on cost and weight and I was in
business.

Trouble was, the van was in Florida, over 800 miles away.  First leg of the
project was a 30 hour 'dash' down to Florida and back.  Weekend #1 gone,
wife not so sure she didn't marry an idiot.

Weekend #2 started Thursday afternoon for me.  MapQuest computed the mileage
from east Tennessee to west Connecticut at just over 827 miles - but routed
me though seven major cities on the eastern seaboard.  Uh uh, no thanks.  I
ran up Interstate 81 most of the way into Pennsylvania, so my mileage
increased, but stress factor stayed low.  Very scenic route.

I arrived in Lakeville around 4:00AM Friday and went to sleep at a local gas
station.  Richard and I got together later that morning - he has a lot of
COOL projects - a single cab, several dune buggies and of course, the
Brubaker Box, which he was kind enough to disassemble for me and later took
me for a ride.  This kit car body is really sleek and well designed - check
it out on his website at:
http://www.brubakerbox_dot_com/

Richard and I spent Friday morning loading the bus and pulling parts,
including a donor bus dashboard a la Sawzall.  I worked without much success
trying to remove the popouts from his parts donor bus - just too rusty. 
This was all to the accompaniment of chickens in the nearby coop - hundreds
of them.  Of course, that many chickens produce certain by-products, a
combination of which I managed to get all over my tools,  tires, trailer and
tootsies.  Very fragrant...

I left Connecticut about 3:00 PM back down I-81 (windows wide open for fresh
air!) headed south for Archdale, North Carolina, home of the famous 'MetWiz'
Kelly Brown.  On the way, I drove through what later turned out to be a
tornado in Pennsylvania.  Road construction was quite prevalent - concrete
barriers spaced 11' apart help to wake you up when your trailer is over 8'
wide.  About midnight I showered up at a truckstop in Virginia, then slept
the rest of the night in the parking lot.  The van was tired as well - very
impressive hills in this area and the load was heavy.

I drove through Richmond on I-64 on Saturday morning and arrived in the area
around noon.  Kelly met me at a local store, smiling like always, even
though what I was bringing him only meant MORE work for him...  I finally
got to see the place where all the metal magic happens and believe me, he
knows his stuff when it comes to vintage VW tin.  He improves the few steel
parts available for busses, and fabs up a lot of parts that simply cannot be
purchased anywhere.  Lots of cool busses inside in progress, more outside
waiting to get in.  My bus soon joined this lineup - amazing how effective a
flat front tire is when you need a handbrake and haven't got one!  Kelly and
his whole family are really great - check out his website (soon to be
updated) at:
http://metalwizard.bizland_dot_com/

After dropping off the bus, I headed for east Tennessee and home.  The
biggest mountains of the trip were west of Ashboro and I was glad the
trailer was empty.  I arrived home around 10PM Saturday night to a local
power outage and wife complaining about battery problems with both my bug
and her Toyota.  Sheeze, ya leave for a few days and hell comes to
breakfast...

Now the van needs to be returned to sunny FLA - another  30 hour 'dash'
south and back - Weekend #3 shot.  Wife really tired of VW's and cars in
general.  I just know I'm likely run across someone's vintage VW jewel soon
now that I'm back in the doghouse with no chance for adoption any time
soon...

But hey, it's all worth it.  Thanks for reading this far.
