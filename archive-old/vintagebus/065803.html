Subject: stuck nyloc - my solution...

Hi,

So this may make some of you ill

The Nyloc nut and drag link ball joint stud weren't going to move 
independently - neither tapping on the top of the joint, nor the bottom 
of the stud, nor my failed attempt to use a C clamp to pull the joint 
into the swing lever arm, none of which kept the stud from moving.

So, I got out the trusty Dremel and made a slot in the end of the stud 
for a large screw driver which let me keep the stud in place while I 
tightened down the nut. I was able to tighten it down to spec, so it 
should be fine. But, having said that and I'm sure Murphy is reading 
this, I'll definitely put the drag link on the list of items to replace 
once the bus is moving on its own again.

I sure wish they put a hex or torx slot on the bottom of the stud for 
situations like this, but that would be asking too much I guess.

Conrad
