&gt;To subscribe, it costs £58 in total for a year. I know it sounds a lot, but
&gt;in Britain we pay over the odds for everything. Cars and magazines are the
&gt;perfect example. However, it's well worth it !

puzzles me this does...

if you subscribe in the uk it costs 30 UKP  a saving on the cover price 12*
issues _at_ 3ukp each is 36

if you subscribe in the states --  you pay 58UKP  30 for the mags 28 for the
post.  but the dollar cover price is way* cheaper than the uk price --  like
3.50 dollars.     thats 2.20 UKP..  12 at that price would only be 26UKP.
thats 26pound for 12* magazines - 32 pound for posting!!!!!  you gotta be
kiddin.
grrr...

rant over

dollar price. :)
