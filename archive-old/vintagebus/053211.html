Subject: RE:  fuel pump woes

Ray, Eric, Dave, Mark, John, etc. etc.

I went down to my local parts man and got one of those tilted pumps,
all of $25 bucks, along with the shorter push rod.  I agree the quality
on these Brazilian aftermarkets ain't the best . . .

I put it on and the choke wire connection point just touched the fan
shroud.  So I fired up the old propane torch and heated the fan shroud a
bit and used a ½ inch socket extender to push the shrould in a bit, the
connector was just below the main indention, and if I say so myself it
looks pretty good and I have 1/8 inch or so room back there, with the
same between my manifold and the fuel pump. I was wary of doing it
because it is so close to one of the fan bolts, but I was careful. 

If I have trouble, I will go with an electric pump, like some of you
suggested.  I am still a few weeks away from putting her in, as I have
some rubber engine seal installation to do.  You DON'T install that
stuff when you can see your breath  in the air!  It is warming up
though.

Thanks guys!
