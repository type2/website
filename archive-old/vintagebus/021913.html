Hi,

Mysteriously, my muffler cracked in half on the drive home from Puyallup. It
is a dual QP Bugpack. The PO put this on figuring, I suppose, that a dual
would provide better flow for a 1776, ported big valve engine with dual 40mm
carb's. Now that I am replacing it I question the necessity of a dual QP.
Wouldn't a single QP do the trick. The header funnels down narrower than the
diameter of the exhaust pipe anyway. 

Please suggest or advice.  I don't want to choke my engine but I don't want
to hang more weight off the back of my engine than necessary either.

Bob
