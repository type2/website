Well maybe it is MontA Vista, I only lived in Sunnyvale for
about 13 years.

The outside width of the closet is about 9-1/8 inches at its
maximum point. The fold down seat and the rear cushion are
exactly 48 inches wide as if they were just cut off a
standard sheet. There is a little more space on either side
of the seat and cushion allowing for  4 x 8 to fit in flat.

No I  did not get the bus. I will have to ask my nephew what
happened to it. He goes to school at Homestead.

I suppose that KK put the large window on the driver side.
measure it for me. I will try to find out if the old RV
store has one that fits.

My windows have square corners because my DD is a delivery
and had the doors without the window cut outs. KK cut square
holes and since I recently removed 2 windows, I can say that
they had to slightly bend the inner door frame parts to make
them fit.

Did I miss answering any questions?

Chris

&gt; Hey there!
&gt;
&gt; &gt;The best part of the Kamper
&gt; &gt;Kits is that I can put a 4 x 8 sheet of plywood through
the
&gt; &gt;back hatch. KK made a narrower side closet and a larger
seat
&gt; &gt;than any of the other camper installers.
&gt;
&gt; Could you possibly measure the width of the closet..maybe
at the widest
&gt; point by the cargo doors?  I know a Bus is curved and all,
so maybe that's
&gt; not the best spot to measure. Ooh, maybe measure the top
and bottom of the
&gt; closet.  And you could also measure the width of the seat?
I've always
&gt; said my closet can't hold more than about 4 shirts.  :)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;By the way, my Dad purchased my DD camper new from Wes
Behel
&gt; &gt;VW in Sunnyvale, and I was with my Dad when he drove it
off
&gt; &gt;the lot. Went on many camping trips in that bus. I have
&gt; &gt;personally driven over 200K miles in it. The bus has
about
&gt; &gt;307K on it now.
&gt;
&gt; Oh man, that's just too damn cool!!!  Did you ever get a
hold of that bus
&gt; at Homestead High?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Any other questions, let me know.  Ah, and it was in
Monte
&gt; &gt;Vista, CA. I don't think that city (town)exists anymore.
&gt; &gt;Neither does the town of Simla that was located at
Homestead
&gt; &gt;Rd and Stevens Creek (the creek, not the road).
&gt;
&gt; Ahhh, now see I put MontE Vista into maps.yahoo_dot_com and it
gave me some
&gt; place in Placer County.  My dad swears it was MontA Vista
&lt;shrug&gt; and
&gt; maps.yahoo_dot_com puts that right next to Cupertino.  Try it,
it's rather neat
&gt; :)  Anyway, I know these actual towns have now been eaten
up by Silicon
&gt; Valley...but do you happen to have the address of where
Kamper Kits was?
&gt; I'd love to just drive by there as a part of history.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I recently called the distributer for Hehr and there are
no
&gt; &gt;more louvered windows left. I found most of a new one at
a
&gt; &gt;very old RV supply store down here is So Cal. Bought it
for
&gt; &gt;$10 because the frame and glass were good.
&gt;
&gt; Good call!  I know I'm going to need to get some new glass
cut for my
&gt; windows...they're all either bubbling or cracked.  :/
Though that does
&gt; remind me, what do your windows look like?  Any idea if
Kamper Kits ever
&gt; offered the long picture window on my drivers side?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Much thanks!
