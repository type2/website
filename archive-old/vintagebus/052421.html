Subject: Re: [VB] Oil Cooler Block Off Plate

why are you doing this?  It seems an odd thing to do to get rid of the oil 
cooler.  WHy not have an oil cooler?

 I am installing an oil cooler block off plate, and I have a few questions I 
 hope some of you can help me with.  First, let me describe the plate:
 
 It is a flat plate with a U-shaped hump for the flow-through tube.  The 
 &quot;hump&quot; has a hex-plug that provides access to the flow-through chamber.
