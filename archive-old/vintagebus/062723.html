Subject: After Market Gas Cap Options?

Happy Friday All,

Got gas earlier this week and spaced the cap on the drip rail.  Stopped 
before getting back on to the Interstate.  Church Key present on drip rail 
no cap.  Kick a U turn and within a minute someone ran over my cap!  Now it 
doesn't seal properly.  Does anyone know the size so I can get a cheezy one 
w/ waring sticker an all from the Flaps?

66deluxe


Enjoy The Weekend!

Eric
