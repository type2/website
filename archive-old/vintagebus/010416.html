Last nite i got it my bus and started it up, and turned on the lights, and
they dimmed a little, and flickered and it went dead.  Same thing it did a
few months back when i first got it going again. since then i have
completely cleaned all the connections, switches all that, trying to fix it.
I thought hmm, cussed a little, got my flashlight and opened the engine lid.
I saw a bit of a spark in the corner of my eye, i reached down and moved the
battery ground cable a bit and heard the cut off jet click, suddenly i
realized why the po had wrapped duct tape around a perfectly good taillight
connection. It was grounding out the system everyonce in a while,i have felt
the electrical drag a few times, vws are funny sometimes.
