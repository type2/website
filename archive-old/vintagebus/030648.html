If the vehicle sells it must have the right to command such a high
price. There is no &quot;effort to pump prices&quot; it is strictly a popularity
thing. My theory, for what it is worth, is that the New Beetle brought
the attention back to old VW's of those people who have money and not
just us few perverted souls who play with these stupid vehicles out of
passion. Unfortuneately when people with money come to the table prices
go up all over.

I haven't read anyone saying the bus is or isn't worth the money. I
can't tell from the pictures how much it is worth.  You say he should
have finished it. He could have a thousand reasons why he has to let it
go. I doubt anyone who put that much time in (even if it was a lousy job
that is a ton of time to create) was doing it just to make a profit.

You say to give credit to a &quot;professionally executed AND completed, well
presented and creative (non-thoughtlessly cookiecutter) custom.&quot; You
cannot tell me that this one is not creative and fairly original. Also I
have seen plenty of self done restorations that can rival the best
&quot;professional shops&quot;. I admit I have seen some hacked up garbage as well
but it was because it was poor workmanship not just because it didn't
roll off of a VW assembly line like that. And the real bottom line is
not how much someone asks but what someone actually gets for a vehicle.

I think it is crazy that my 57 23 window sold for almost $11,000 in
about 2 hrs. It is not that the quality of busses is sliding, it is that
the prices on all of them are going up. Panels used to be the red headed
step children, they now seem to be having a rise in popularity (which is
a real bummer because I had hoped to pick up a double door panel before
prices got too wild). We cannot control the market. Speaking of outlaws
did any of you see the Double Cab with the sunroof clip and side windows
that Gary Emory (of outlaw fame) built.
(http://www.356shop_dot_com/vw_truck.htm) It was beautifully done. The rumor
I heard was $50,000 for it. I don't think I really believe that rumor
but that should keep some of you arguing for awhile.

I drove a double door panel for quite awhile and the extra light and air
flow would be greatly appreciated. Let's see if I get a second on the
trailer, and pull the oldest out of preschool, I might be able to afford
the infamous purple panel. It would be worth it just to watch the
prurist get so uptight.

Stirring the pot,
