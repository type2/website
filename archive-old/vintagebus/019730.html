Yes, also a marine epoxy or , believe it or not, or floor epoxy would also make an adequate
solution.

The floor epoxy, such as the Behr namebrand, can be found at the Home Depot, and can be tinted to
a color match.  I used to work the local Home Depot, and we would tint that stuff for all kinds of
reasons.  If I remember correctly, there is a &quot;deep&quot; white that should match near perfectly.  Any
serious home wears or paint store should carry this stuff.

Good Luck,
Travis

&gt; When you send a steering wheel out to be restored, most places end up
&gt; painting them.  The difference is that they use an epoxy paint.  Very tough,
&gt; and chip resistant.  What you need to do is go down to Wally world
&gt; (wal-mart) and buy the appliance paint. It comes in black, white, and
&gt; almond.  It says on the can that it is an epoxy paint.  I have had very good
&gt; results, I have a wheel that I did about 5 years ago, and it has very little
&gt; wear through, and only a couple of chips, and it has been through 5 people,
&gt; and all of them used it as a daily driver.
