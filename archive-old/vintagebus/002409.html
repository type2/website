the busiest bus weekend i've ever had
finished painting the double door (1 of the major bus rescues)
3 weeks start to paint, work done ; cargo rocker, left and right
rear rocker panels, lower cargo door inner frame, repaired both rear
corners, fitted and found hardware for all doors, replaced drivers side
floor half ( cut out old floor from one of bus rescues) cleaned it up and
welded in
installed front bullet turn signels (po cut out and put in fried eggs) all
this work
was done working 3 hours every evening after closing shop, half days on sats
and all day sundays, when finished preping and put in paint booth, it took 6
hours
to spray sealer coat then apply paint ( it took 1 gallon), if i could only
get
customers done this fast, total hours from entering shop to finished paint
approx
80 hours so at 40 dollars an hour $3200.00 and another $500.00 in materials
and i could have spent another 20-30 hours on the body, but who wants a
perfect
bus, would be afraid to drive it. see it at OCTO and the CLASSIC, now only
to
put it together have less then 2 weeks for that, have the brakes done and a
brand new
factory 1600 with duel kadrons and 1.25 ratio rockers ready to go in,
AND also this weekend i installed bulkhead to floor section in a 21 window
delux,
drivers rocker and inner frame support and the belly pans, and not to think
that this would be enough work, built a custom rear cage and reciever hitch
for a meyers manx, and thats how i spent my last 96 hours and what did YOU
do
