&gt; Since we're on electric fuel pumps I have a related question.  I fly
&gt; airplanes and there are always two fuel pumps, a mechanical one on the
&gt; engine and an electric one on the fuel line, the redundancy is obviously
&gt; necessary in airplanes.

Many high-wing airplanes have only one pump.  Gravity feed is the backup.

&gt; I plan to rebuild my engine this winter and
&gt; currently have an electric fuel pump.  I was contemplating reinstalling the
&gt; stock fuel pump and was curious if I could leave my electric pump in its
&gt; current location but switch it so it only runs if I throw the switch (back
&gt; up fuel pump).  I don't know however if the fuel will flow through the pump
&gt; if it is not switched on and/or if it's on would it push the fuel through
&gt; the stock pump if the stock pump had failed.  Any ideas???

We tried this on a Ch*vy and had vapor lock problems due to a restriction
in the electric pump.  The pump was added near the tank to speed tank
switching and prevent vapor lock.  It worked fine when the pump was on,
but when off it vapor locked badly.  I finally replumbed it to simply
refill the main tank rather than feeding the engine directly.

You could do a bypass with a check valve.
