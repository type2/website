I am a man of modest means but could afford any of the mid-sized modern
plastic wondercars. However, I *choose* to have my VWs and no matter how
uggggly they are, I love 'em and drive 'em everywhere.

Bob, in northern Calif.
55 bug, show car.
59 bug, &quot;Kermit&quot; with shag carpeting headliner and duct tape seat covers
64 bug, &quot;Blue Lady&quot; purchased from original owner who only drove it on
Sundays to church. Well, almost....
'59 single cab. &quot;Puff the tragic wagon&quot; hauled of a ranch where it had
been sitting since Heck was a pup. A great runner, but watch out for
falling bondo and rust. Used for hauling gravel, bricks, and making dump
runs.
'61 westy, &quot;Rhoda&quot; as in &quot;On the road again....&quot; Hauled out of a field.
Drip rails rusted away. Other problems. Interior 99% complete. We use it
for camping.
'63 camper with gutted interior. Hauled away from a single mom before
she was arrested for drugs. Her kids really beat this one up. Now has a
new motor &amp; tranny. Probably my favorite daily driver. &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;
'67 bug convertible. Project for my wife.
