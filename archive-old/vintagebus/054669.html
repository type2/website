Subject: still no 3rd or 4th gear

I'm pretty convinced the problem lies right at the shift plate.  Everything
else is tight in back.  The Bentley is on my xmas list, so I guess I'm now
looking for a brief description of what things should look/act like from
shifter, down through floor.  Right now, there is a chrome cover over
another plate on top, and another plate with a J shaped hook under the
floor.  Where the male meets female is very loose fitting.  When I move
through gears - reverse, first and second work great, but I no mater how far
right I get,  I'm still just getting first and second.  I've tried spinnning
the plate up front, with the same result.  Thanks for all the help so far.
(I work on all this stuff alone most of the time, so this list is really my
other set of eyes, ears and hands :))
