Well, yuck.

I changed the engine oil of the 1600 dp in my '60 DC  very recently (I like
to change between 1500 and 2500 miles, depending on conditions and oil
color), and this is the second time I had done so and found a piece of red
RTV or some similar sealant inside the strainer.  When inspecting the
engine, I noted that the cylinders were sealed with stuff of the same hue.

I believe I know the correct answer:  Tear the thing down and clean it out
before I destroy my engine components by clogging oil passages.  I did
mention in earlier posts that I thought the engine made weird noises....I
have asked several VW people whether they thought that these noises were
bad.....it is a regular tack-tack-tack-tack, very similar to lifter
noise....it may well be, and the engine runs well, no overheating or other
problems (besides the very seldom occurance of misfire which has been
happening the last few days...I think it is points).

Are there any procedures I can do to tell if I have a problem?  I have run
this engine at least five thousand miles, and the noise has not changed,
although sometimes it seems quieter than others, but there are no
circumstances surrounding this that I have yet to discern as a clue.

This is my daily driver, and I'm lovin' every minute of it!

Thanks,
Gene Cornelius
