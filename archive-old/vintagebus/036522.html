I was comparing two 4 leg full width middle seats and noticed that the
tubular leg that clamps to the floor near the cargo doors is canted out a
couple of inchs on one and is vertical on the other seat. Neither seat has a
diagonal in the frame so I think they are both split seats. Can any one help
tell me what I have. Also I have seen stamped and cast plates under the
middle seat. Anyone know what year they changed, what would be correct for a
1959.

Thanks,
Paul Dotson
