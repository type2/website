&gt;Send your VIN number and 20,- DM to the museum

If you are doing the conversion yourself, you might consider sending Euro
instead of DM.  Both are still legal tender but Euro is heavily preferred.
From March 2002 trading DM for Euro will be much more of a hassle for the
recipient - possible, but a hassle.  DM20 is and will always be EUR 10.23;
the conversion rate between each of the twelve currencies being replaced
and the Euro are fixed.  US banks may not be able to provide you with Euro
banknotes right away; the banknotes won't be available to the general public
in Europe until Tuesday.

If you pay by credit card, your card will probably be charged in Euro
and then converted to US dollars at that day's rate.  The Euro-USD rate
varies but has _generally_ been from 0.9:1 to 1.1:1 or so.  In other
words, a Euro is about one US dollar.
