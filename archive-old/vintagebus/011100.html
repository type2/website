Hi Matt, can't help with most of this stuff, sold my extra safari bits, no 
extra middle seat side trim plate, no 14&quot; beauty ring (I think)  I want  one  
15&quot; ring for my 61 actually, but I do have a decent, not perfect, there is a 
little bit of spickling, deluxe horn button I would want $30 for, the ring is 
white but was repainted.   Wiper blades cost silly money dont they, ouch.  
you can get the panel clips from rar hatch panels of bay windows, if there 
are any in junkyards near you.
