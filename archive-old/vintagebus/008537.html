Let's all chip in for it then take a &quot;Sawzall&quot; to a look-alike bus then send
him the pictures.
This guy needs a lesson, I gather from the overall tone of his E-bay ad that
he's an a-hole anyway.
I feel bad for his son.

&gt; If I spent twelve big for an old bus I'd do anything I wanted to do
&gt; with it.  Up to and including installing the baddest sound system I
&gt; could find and cutting a hole in the roof and welding a bug top to it
&gt; and hitting the Phish tour!
&gt;
&gt; After the title is transfered the FORMER owner has absolutely NO say.
