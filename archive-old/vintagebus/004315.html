&gt;seems like it is the one way valve thing happening - i fetched a flex hose
&gt;&gt;from my local VW dealers parts, was skint - but i remembered he owed me
some
&gt;credit.
&gt;just got under the bus last night, to relace the hose, to find it was too
&gt;long..... so to tonight it is then.
&gt;


You really should replace all of them. Brakes are no place to economize. If
one is bad, they are probably all bad, and if you don't know when they were
last replaced they are due now. Hoses have a big effect on the brake quality
on buses, one that too many bus drivers have never experienced.
