With a load, my 1776 that is dual webered, freeway flyer trans, and tall 15&quot;
tires that knocks 5mph off the speedo, I do have trouble on the hills.  I
know if I went to 14&quot; tires it would help but with any kind of load or even
pulling a trailer, I would suffer.  I still think that for a workaholic bus,
a T4 2L is going to be the ticket.
