&gt; Hey All,
&gt; I am getting ready to have the Westy painted and
&gt; have a question.  Were any 
&gt; 67 westies two tone? All of the original paint ones
&gt; I have seen were single 
&gt; color.  If there were two tone westies, what were
&gt; the available colors?  
&gt; Thanks for all the helpful advice.
