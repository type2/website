Subject: Lame Brake Question: Leaky Cylinder
Date: Fri, 13 Apr 2001 21:53:01 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

The reason this question is lame is because it is my own stupid lameness
that may have caused the problem.  My '66 Westy is almost on the road again
after an 8-month rest-o, and I am scrambling to put the final little details
back in (bearings, wheels, engine, windows...you know...little stuff).

Anyway, I went to pull off the left rear drum to get the sand out of there,
and as I was doing this, I noticed a yellowish-clear liquid running down my
rim/tire.  Brake fluid.  I do not have time for this.

Here's what I think happened:  Back in late June or early July, I replaced
that cylinder, and also tried to get the RGB to stop leaking.  I did not
slacken the e-brake adjustment before doing the brake adjustment, (something
I learned recently), and I think perhaps the wheel cylinder may have
overextended and fluid collected in the drum.  Note:  The rear shoe was wet.

I had thought that the attempt to fix the RGB leak was a failure...maybe it
was that I was seeing brake fluid?

Question:  The cylinder seems to work fine still, and I adjusted the brakes
properly.  Is this unsafe to use it?  Can I watch it for leaks, etc, and
carry a spare?  I am hoping that it will all be fine, as I need to finish
this bus like now.

Safety first, though...  (Single circuit brakes, stillm BTW)

Later, and thanks...
