I'm a newcomer to this listing, I've got a real craving for a VW Bus, Vanagon,
whatever they call them. . .

I've seen the pages on such busses, my parents think that they are ugly, but
if I could find one to restore, I could make it into a really cool war wagon.

I'm an owner of a 1990 Subaru Loyale, and there isn't much room for
improvement (because as of now I don't have the money).  I'm just gonna look
and see what people do to their own busses. . .hey. ..

VW makes a new Beetle. . .why not a new BUS?  That would rock I think, all
souped up----

I've noticed that the BUS's were used for everything, herse's, ambulances,
trucks, convertables, etc.  It's amazing.

Well, first I need to get one. . .---- hard to find I guess, and for my $$
situation, pretty impossible at this time.


Have a good one, feel free to chat with me
