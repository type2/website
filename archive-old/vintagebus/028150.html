Subject: Wheel seal question

Rebuilding the brake system on my 62 DC, and have a question.  This bus
still has the original (I think) bearings and seals in the front drums.
The seals are all metal.  I've only ever seen the silicone ones that are
fairly easy to remove.  These metal ones are a bit#h to get out.
Anybody have a good tip to remove them.  I'd like to save the inner
bearings and don't want to destroy them by pounding them out from the
other side.

Thanks for any help!

Steve
