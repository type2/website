The 67 21 window Deluxe in my shop has rear seat belt mounting holes. There
are reinforcment plates and brackets welded from these also for more rear
support.
If I can find my digi camera I will take some photo's of the mounting plates
and support brackets.

&lt;&lt; As I recall, cars weren't required to have seat belts in the early 60's.

My 67 Beetle had seat belts and I think that was the first year.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Andrew,
The bug and Ghia got seat belt mounting points (Threaded holes built into
the 
VW) in 1963.  The bus did not have these seat blet points as a standard till

1968.  Best you go out to your local wrecking yard and take a gander at a 
post-1967 buses for proper seat belt mounting positions.  Then it is up to 
you wether to cut these points out and weld them into your bus or just 
drawing up exact locations and drilling these holes in your bus.  If the 
latter make sure to use very large OD thick washers to prevent the belt
mount 
from just pulling through the sheet metal.  Plus remember your fuel tank is 
just behind the panel/firewall behind the rear seat!   Eric&amp;Barb
