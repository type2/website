&lt;&lt; I heard thru the grapevine that there is a Society Of Transporter Owners 
show/swapmeet in Huntington Beach, California on October 22nd. Does anyone 
know as to where it is held at exactly?? (Address wise) &gt;&gt;

Oh my, that's almost offensive....the show is put on by OCTO....Das 
Octoberfest and it's at Transporter Gardens in Huntington Beach on the 22nd.

I didnt see anything on their webpage as far as directions and stuff, but 
it's easy to find....from the 405 take beach Blvd west/south make a right on 
Talbot and you cant miss it.  They usually start around 8am

See you there

Matt
