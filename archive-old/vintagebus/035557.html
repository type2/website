&lt;&lt; Okay, how's this work? &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
There are at least three type of these switches.  One that has a tab clamped 
on the shift linkage and turns the light on immeadiately when you shift into 
reverse used in the 1950s and 60.  Then there is the type that was used in 
the 60 thru the 1970s that threads on between the speedo and its cable and 
acuates when the front left wheel turns one full turn backwards.  So it is 
not an instant on.  The last used from 1967 on is a switch threaded into the 
tranny nose cone and is acuated by shiifting into reverse.  Eric&amp;Barb
