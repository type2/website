Subject: Re: [VB] porsche pulley in

&gt; &gt; Wow thats a lot.  but the only sizes listed are for the 50.5mm  oversize
&gt; &gt; diameter.
&gt; &gt; Can anybody make sense of that?
&gt;
&gt; Hi Andy,
&gt; That is the oversized hub for engine cases damaged where the pulley slides in
&gt; and thusly the case is machined to a bigger diameter and then requires the
&gt; oversized pulley hub to keep the engine oil from leaking out there due to
&gt; internal air pressure inside the case.

So the oversize pulley has an oversize slinger. hmmmmmmm......
50.5mm a little less than 2&quot; that makes sense, thanks.
