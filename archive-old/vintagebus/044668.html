 So i have decided that greasing my fornt end will occur every oil change,
 that is easier to remeber than every other, and since new kingpins are
 NLA, rebuilt expensive, it makes good sense to keep on top of things :)
 (probably wont hurt to use that needle grease adapter to squirt a bit into
 the tie rod boots at the same time...)
 
 Also i have heard that the new link pin kits that are avaialble just dont
 fit right, so in essence new link pins are NLA too, or at least ones worth
 using anyhow.
 ---------------------------
I switched to 3K greaseings too.  or more often if I end up doing a lot of 
driving on rutted potholed roads.  same reasons-Cause a tube of grease is 
cheap, it's not hard to do, and much easier than replacing spindles.

I have used the Wolfgang spindles, w/o any problems.    Made the bus in 
question have very good handling, immensely better  than the old very worn 
ones.  I reused link pins and needle bearings though, as they were good.
....................................
 Next thing on order is cleaning my oil control valves.  My oil light
 flickers at idle sometimes and im unsure if its beacuse the oil pressure
 sender is in the t3 cooler or i really have a pressure problem. using the
 t3 cooler in an upright configuration puts the sender in a wierd location.
  &gt;&gt;

why not hook the wire up to the sende rin the usual location?
