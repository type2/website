Subject: End-caps for Empi Five-spokes?

All,

I need a set of metal end-caps that will fit the empi five-spokes on my '66 
bus, particularly over the big-nut RGBs in the rear.  The caps that came 
with the bus were plastic, did not fit over the rear nuts without splitting, 
and overall seemed pretty cheap, anyway.  I tried to buy some from bugpack, 
but when I received them they would not fit over the rear nuts, though I was 
assured they would.  Can anyone give me a hand?

Richard
'66 Samba
