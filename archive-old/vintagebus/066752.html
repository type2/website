Subject: Re: [VB] JCWhitney tie rod removal tool - not worth the money

Sears ..... Craftsman ..... They have tie rod removers and they are
garanteed for life. You can weld a nut that fits the tie rod thread to a
hardened piece of 1&quot; round stock, screw it on till it bottoms out then snug
it up (make sure that you still have space between the nut and the arm) then
smack it with a good sized hammer. The shock and force pops them right
apart. I use one I made for diesel truck tie rods and it works every time
and it cost me zip to make it (actually got paid to make it since I was on
the clock).
