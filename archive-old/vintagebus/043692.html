&gt;
&gt;We have met too many folks at the rest stops with only the nylon 
&gt;straps on, due to no instructions fro the rental shop.  Check the nylon 
&gt;straps every 50 miles to make sure they do not loosen up (Which they do!).  

I'll second that.  I towed my Bus from Houston to Tulsa.  I used a
rental flatbed car-hauler (no Bus wheels on ground) as I was unsure
of the condition of the Bus' running gear.  It had the nylon straps
over the front tires and safety chains, which I put over the torsion
tubes in front and axle tubes in back.  I tried to get the chains
as tight as I could, while allowing for movement of the Bus suspension
etc.  I was glad I did because...

The nylon strap on the front left tire kept popping off.  The Bus
wasn't in any immediate danger of leaving the trailer, but I had
to re-do that left front strap two or three times at gas stops.
The one on the right tire held fine all the way from Houston to
Tulsa.

I'd also suggest having your oil can or maybe some WD-40 handy.  Some
of the hardware on the rental trailer required a little, uh, gentle
persuasion before it would move.  Try to keep the lubricants off the
nylon webbing itself, though.

Good luck!
