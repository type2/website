&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt;Just looking over the ..&quot;Original VW Bus&quot;
&gt; by Laurence Meredith.. and I noticed that
&gt; he apparently has another book out..on
&gt; VW Vans....

I have both his books and I like them both, but they are apples and
oranges. VW Bus Custom Handbook (ISBN 1-870979-47-8) is available
through my club's On-Line VW bookstore ( see URL below) and almost any
bookstore can order it for you. This book has a lot more on the
restoration and customization of buses. He goes into dropping, custom
body work, interior, some very schmolzy, some rather nice. There are
also some very very nice stock buses, as this was an earlier book, and
he hadn't yet done one dedicated solely to original buses.

Check out the other VW books as well.
