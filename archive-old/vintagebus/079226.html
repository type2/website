Subject: Re: [VB] Choke/Fuel Reserve Cables

I got one of those cables from WW recently when I put the manual choke in my 
65... it was ~$22.50 + shipping to WA state... came to ~ $30 US for one... 
That was the only place I found for it, lest I got an old one out of a junk bus, 
but that's be rusted stuck and a PITA anyway.  seemed pricey to me too, but I 
guess it's the only game in town.  

I pulled the cable out of the sheath and greased it and replaced it.... works 
great... nice part.

So is WW the only place that sells the Choke Cable for my 60 bus?  It appears
that they want $45.00 for 2 and another $45.00 to ship em.  Those are Canadian
prices ... so that $90.00 is maybe ... 75 U.S. - but still - that seems like
way too much - not that I can't afford it ... but I hate getting ripped off.
Does anyone else sell things things?
