I need to second Jim's annoyance with VW magazine publishers for
avoiding great, popular VW events like Jerome.  A VW bus camp that some
of you folks may have missed, but certainly the VW magazines have missed
is the VW Bus Camp at Burning Man.  This camp is one amoungst the
thousand or so camps that set up in the Nevada Desert around Labor Day
at Burning Man. This is the best VW Camp/Show/Party on the planet!  Of
course, the VW rags would have to be shelved back with the &quot;adult&quot;
reading material if they covered the VW Bus Camp at Burning Man.  A
smart and good time that you will need to repeat.  Gary Gibson
