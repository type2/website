&gt; Steel springs do not 'settle' unless they are overstressed and the metal
&gt; deforms (elastic limit is exceeded). I would think that the VW engineers
&gt; designed the torsion bars to take infinite life (or close to it), so you
&gt; should be able to bottom out either the front or rear without exceeding the
&gt; elastic limit, therefore sag should not happen. (Theory is nice until
&gt; reality sets in. What a concept.)
&gt;
&gt; George, do you have any thoughts on this?

I've observed them to settle initially.  This is more likely to be the
splines seating than the actual metal of the bar twisting.  Still, there
has to be a reason for the prohibition against switching a bar from one
side to the other.  In any case, once they settle, they stay that way for
a very long time.  It would be interesting to know what the actual setting
used at the factory (with new torsion housing and spring) was.  Did VW add
in a few extra minutes of twist to account for the initial sag?
