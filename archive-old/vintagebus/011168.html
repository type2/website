Subject: Re:  [VB] 13&quot; external snap ring pliers, enough for axles/redux boxes?

clip at transmission?  &gt;&gt;

Hi Al,
Probably not!  Best to get Proto tools #394, and 385.  The latter is 
reversable to deal with internal and external small Clips, and is handy for 
working with the throwout clutch arm C-clip.  We have dealt with cheapy 
C-clip tools in the past and have had nothing but slippage problems and 
overhardened tips that shattered after a few uses.  Eric&amp;Barb
