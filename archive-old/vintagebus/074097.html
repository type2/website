&gt; that it has already been tapped and dyed once, so this means it needs to be

&gt; me out?

Hi Tracey,
The problem with Heli-coils is that they tend to come out with the bolt the 
next time you remove it!  Especially in the exhaust parts.  Better to use a 
solid threaded insert such as Time-Sert, that locks itself to the part.  Check 
out thier website _at_:
