    His case has been bored .060&quot; over, not .080&quot;.... unless we're going for
.020&quot; extra bearing crush...
    .010&quot; crank, .060&quot; case line bore, .080&quot; thrust cut....
    .250 mm crank, 1.50 mm case line bore, 2.00 mm thrust cut....
    I hope that you can find that set for him....

later...

&gt;  mister no quarter, what you are looking for are vw part#  111 198 053 OS
&gt; these are 10 under crank,  80 over case and 2 over on thrust, what you want
&gt; to make sure
&gt; is that the thrust fits correctly, if not you will have to machine the
&gt; bearings inner thrust ring
&gt; to fit, no problem any  machine shop  should be able to fit the bearing for
&gt; you
