Subject: looking for extra wheels

does anyone near TN happen to have an extra wheel or 2 for sale? It's
coming time to replace my two front tires. I'd really prefer to just
take 2 wheels and try to clean them up nicely before having tires
mounted. I only have 5 though (and 4 are holding my bus up )

this is for my 66 bus w/ stock 14&quot; wheels. thanks.
