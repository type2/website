I recommend switching to big nut RGBoxes, and not having a larger than 4.12 
R&amp;P.   If you want a 3.88R&amp;P I think you want a larger than 1600 motor.

from the rpms you had posted before, I think you had a 4.37 with your LNRGBs, 
and a 4.12 with BNs will give you lower rpms at the same speeds than the 
gears you have now in your bus.

you know, even if you just put BNs on your trans it will make a noticable 
difference.  and as you have 15s on the back.

probably some PO  swapped over the trans with another when the previous trans 
konked out.

well, well.... this is the dilema i am having right now. i think i roached 
my motor (SP1500) cruising around at 4800 rpm (60mph) too long. for some 
reason my early '66 has a small nut. my first bus having a big nut, i really 
didnt realize how high the rpm's were. so now it seems i have to rebuild, 
and i dont want to put the SN back in. i live in Ohio, the flatlands, and 
take trips around here camping, rafting and stuff... never climbing like you 
westerners. so is a freeway flier made for me? i have 195 15's on there now, 
but have ridden with 205/75's while getting the others painted and didnt 
notice much of an rpm difference. the tranny sh#i is too confusing for me 
:-(
