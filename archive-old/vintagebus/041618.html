&gt; Hi:
&gt; Where do you guys usually get your tools?  I need to buy a 215ft-lbs torque 
&gt; wrench, 46mm socket and a floor jack(what lift capacity do I need for engine 

Forget the mongo torque wrench.  Head on down to sears and buy a 3/4 drive
slide bar and a 1-13/16&quot; socket.  Divide your weight by the desired
torque,
multiply by 12, and measure that number of inches from the center of the
nut along the slide bar (and cheater, if needed)  Apply all of your weight
at the measured spot and you'll get the desired torque.

Just about any floor jack will do.  Be sure that the platform and wheels
are stable enough to meet your needs.  Mine is a bit small and wobbly, but
it also fits into the bus for travelling.  It'll handle the type 1 engine
and transmission together.  Bought it at Harbor freight, purveyor of fine
Chinese tools.  http://www.harborfreight_dot_com
