Subject: Re: [VB] Angle of Dangle

You don't really need a compression tool for bus plates, they dont have a
preload like a beetle. floor jack works well. I used a magnetic protractor
from sears. $5-$8 range


&gt; I had to do the same thing with my SC. Fortunately, all the PO did was
lower
&gt; the rear be adjusting the spring plates on the torsion bars. I just
followed
&gt; the Bently and readjusted them back to 20 degrees. I built a spring plate
&gt; compression tool just like the one shown in the pictures and a simple
degree
&gt; plate. If anyone is interested in buying them, I made two sets and can
part
&gt; with one for $25. It was a big help to me. If it's beyond anyone's meager
&gt; salary to own one, get with your local club and see if they want to buy it
&gt; for their members.
