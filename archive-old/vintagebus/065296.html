I dunno about those particular ones, but I use the distributor that 
comes on an autostick '74 bug (043 905 205 A).  The centrifugal 
advance is a bit less than the 009.  The one on my bus is 22 degrees
at 3500 RPM, hose plugged with the timing set at 7.5 BTDC at idle, but
the vacuum can makes up for that :-)  I like it much better than the 009.
Hesitation was history when I put it on.  I pick them up at swaps 
cheap.

Just curious, do you mean that it has the same centrifugal curve as a
009 plus a vacuum can?  Isn't that a bit much or is it timed
differently?

Anyway, I love mine although it's not quite what you've got!
