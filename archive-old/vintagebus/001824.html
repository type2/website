Hello everyone, I just bought a 62 camper and was wondering if you camper
experts can help me identify it. It is a converted Kombi with no pop top.
The interior is set up alot like my SO-42. The wood is very light in color
(almost white), and has dark green cushions. I know I have seen one just
like it in a bus that I believe the gentleman told me was an EZ camper. The
icebox looks to have a metal door that is brown in color. Unfortunately, the
bus is in very, very sad shape. It will be parted out. (Not on E-bay) I'm
going to snag a few parts for myself, but everything else will be for sale
including interior. I haven't even seen this bus in the daylight yet, but
holler if you might be interested. The bus is 100% complete. Thanks!
