needed stuff.........brakes, decent tires , lights, a seat + seat belt, 
windshield + insurance, bus not braking in half from rust......

Options..........all the comforts of home........radio, side windows,  
heater, ice chest, etc
Hey it was 70 degrees, who needs a heater......

who cares about......paint , rattles, &quot;floor airconditioning&quot; , lowered etc

registration is a&quot; fix it&quot; ticket in California.....but your car can be 
impounded by the police if it is out of registration for more than a year and 
on the road.......the cop must of liked him and not thought it was that much 
of a pile.

What have we all driven thru the years...........no 4th gear once, another 
bus only 2nd+4th ,  brakes that pulled to one side etc........ but that was 
on the road trip, not at the start.............

Keep it safe so you can be at the next years bus meet and the year after that

see you at OCTO
