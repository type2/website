Make your way to Albuquerque and hook up with JP
Henrikse at the Bus Co-op &lt;JPHenrikse_at_aol_dot_com&gt; or
order a Bentley's Workshop Manual 1963-1967 and do it
yourself. Doing a brake job &quot;the right way&quot; is not
hard even for a novice mechanic. It is *very* basic. A
few tricks help but is basically watching how parts
come apart and replacing them the same way.
First determine/isolate the systems' fault(s) prior to
abitrarily replacing everything just for the fun of
spending money. Repair and/or replace the offending
problem or part(s). I do agree that brakes are not a
system to skimp on. Make sure that the system is solid
prior to driving your beast! Keeping your health is a
priority. 

Don't be afraid of anything exception being the ripoff
artist who floated the $700 bid. There are only five
million VW bus lovers in New Mexico. Swing a dead cat
on a short rope and you'll probably hit one.
