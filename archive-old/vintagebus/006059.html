Tonight I cleaned and painted my bay window gas tank.  I did a test fit of
it last night and man, you guys ain't kidding when you say it's a tight fit.
I actually was flexing the cargo floor up and gave a swift kick with my foot
to get that tank installed but if I ever gotta pull that tank again, lord
help me!

I need someone to tell me how I can supply power to the sending unit and
then using a multimeter, test to see if the output of the guage is any good.

And one more tidbit - those of you with a 63 to 67 Bentley for a bus will
enjoy the typo I found on page E-14 2a under the topic of removing and
installing the speedometer.  Post the result to the list when you find it as
it's quite funny.

Later!
