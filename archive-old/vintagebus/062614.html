Subject: Rear spring plate adjustment

Hello,

I just finished installing a straight axle kit on my 63 single cab and when 
I set it down off of the jack stands the wheels are tucked in (negative 
camber?) Which way do I need to move the plates to get zero camber? I used 
an inclinometer to set the plates at 7 degrees at the recommendation of 
wolfgangs do I need to go up or down?

The engine is in and I bounced on the back of the truck to try to get it to 
sit down more but it seems like it has completely settled.

Thanks,
Bob
