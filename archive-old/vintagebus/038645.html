does anybody know of a company that makes good, durable custom roof racks? i
know there's one out there, but i don't know the company name. do they have
a website? (shameless plugs accepted) i am thinking about getting a rack for
my dormobile to go over the cab. that way i can have room for a spare tire
and maybe a propane tank. does anyone have any ideas for mounting a full
size propane tank outside of a bus besides storing one on a roof rack?
TIA,
casey
