Hi Mark,
Get a cheapy ($15-20.00) volt/ohm meter with DC voltage ranges that will work 
well with your VW (IE 10 volt scale works well with 6 volt or 15 volt scale 
for 12 volts.) system from your local electronic shop or hardware store.  
Check the voltage at the battery post.  Are you getting 6 to 7 volts or less? 
 If less your battery needs a charge or is bad.  Whatever the voltage reading 
check the wiring as it goes forward and the voltage going from the ignition 
switch to the solinoid and coil.  Any noticable drop in voltage must be 
cleaned/dielectric greased/ soldered, heat shrinked or just replaced to keep 
the voltage as high as possible through the entire system.  Aftermarket crimp 
connectors are junk without being soldered/heat shrinked.  Once this is done 
it will either work properly or you can begin to figure out what else is 
wrong and needs repair or replacing.  Eric&amp;Barb
