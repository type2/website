&gt; I doubled my estimated budget before I started the job and still managed
to
&gt; exceed that. I'm still quite a way from where I'd like to be and even if I
&gt; don't completely lose my mind and try to complete the resto accurately I
&gt; will easily end up spending three times my original estimate.
&gt;


When I bought Rosie ('63 DC)  I decided I was willing to spend as much as a
new Japanese pickup to have a nicely restored truck. I wasn't far from the
mark (although I have never had the nerve to actually add up all the
receipts).
