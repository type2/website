'I had the exact same problem with the '60(dcab)' but I wasn't able to get
the damned motor in. It was a motor that I had spent a lot building. When I
figured it out I did a real shade tree number! I got it on the lower engine
studs and then put threaded rod through the upper mounts. I tightened them
up a turn or two and then turned the motor over with a spanner. Had to turn
it ten or twenty times per tighten! This idiot procedure took me half a day.


I just didn't have the balls to run the thing in the bell housing. When my
friend Paul who taught me the little I know about driving and maintaining a
bus heard what I had done he laughed his ass off.

Later
