Been there, done that VW yard about 3-4 years ago.  Got lots of stuff at a
good, fair price and a guided tour of the town and all the other places and
cars the fella owns.  It was 2 full days of very hot dirty work through lots
of raccoon dung, but worth our time for what we pulled out of there.  Looks
like they've gotten some new stuff too. Eric&amp;Barb
