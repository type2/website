Paul, the best tool you have at hand, is the one one
your shoulders. If you can keep a cool head in any
given situation, it keeps it clear for good thinkin.
If a person starts freakin out, theyre done for. A
person can think there way out of most any problem, no
matter how unconventional or unorthadox it sound or
looks:)
 I seen where one person was in Baja California in a
dune buggy, the passenger side rear hub stripped out.
what they did was swap the hubs, put the Jesus Nut
hammer tool on the driver side nut (swapped hubs
remember) , put a big*ss clamp thru the rim then thru
the hammer tool. Got em home:)
 Electric fuel pump went out on my moms Hon*a wagon
the night I decide to sneak it out:( Found a windex
bottle on the side of the road, filled it w/gas, my
buddy drove will I played the fuel injecter by hand:)
Even tho it was dangerous, it got us the three miles
home.
 It boils down to a good noggen is a good tool:)
