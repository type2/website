Subject: Re: [VB] Electrical Problems

Hi John,
You just have to go through your electrical system!  Adding relays will solve 
the one problem now, but we do not like to do this because it makes the 
electrical system more complicated, and thusly harder to figure out later when 
other problems arise!

Then follow your wiring harness, checking for voltage dropage along the way, 
soldering or cleaning, and tightening, each connection.
