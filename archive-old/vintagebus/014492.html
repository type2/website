&lt;&lt; That's why they are usually in such bad shape.  They are a PITA to
 replace.  You'll have to bleed the brake system when you finish
 separating the lines for the repair, make the repair, re-connect the
 lines. &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
That's strange.  The original grommets we have are cut across one side so one
can install them with the brake system together.  Eric &amp; Barb
