&gt; One Off???
&gt; 68 is a loaf yes? Well my 68 and 69 have the same cable and no boosters for
&gt; a few more years.
The '68 w/o booster is shown to be a one off cable.
This is thru chassis# 218 104 707
The references show that the '68 - '69 with a booster are the same cables
(beginning w/# 218 104 708)
The '68 -'71 cables are the same (if w/o booster) after #218 104 707.
'70 - '71 with the booster use the same cable
I'm no expert, just passing on criteria pulled from text.
later
