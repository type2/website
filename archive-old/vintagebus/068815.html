Subject: Re: [VB] Spring plate covers, spring plate bushes and thanks

just makes sure you mark where to put the plates back on, so you don't get 
them rotated a notch or more.  

I got new rubber bushings from the VW dealer.  They are the same as the bay 
window bushings.  IThey didn't have them in stock, so had to do a special 
order, which meant I had to go back and get them a few days later, no big 
deal.

I spray painted my spring plates with black semi gloss rattle can.

 Did you do anything to your spring plates?  I am thinking about maybe
 removing them, using to pieces of wood either side of where the splines are
 with a piece of thread-all and nuts holding it together?
 
 Or should I just leave alone?
