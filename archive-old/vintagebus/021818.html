&gt; I took detailed pix along the way, and I'm thinking of writing up the
&gt; procedure.

Yes please Thom - if you could make some indication of the difference
between Alan Schofield's lower nose and the one you used that would be
interesting - the only instructions I saw for fitting those many and complex
nose sections is actually on his price list I think - the lower part of this
diagram:

I'm getting a very slight line of corrosion coming through the paint and can
see the join where this has been done before....and will need doing again :(

Still haven't got my bus back after the &quot;ding&quot; last April (see link below),
well, I lie, I got it back from the garage OK (after 6 months) and the next
day the ill gearbox died completely on the motorway (grindings and gnashings
of teeth).

I sourced a good 1500 T1 box from Glynn here in Blighty and swapped over the
ring and pinion to swap back in - to find that the garage who'd repaired the
bus first time had welded in the rear valance - making really quite a good
job of it :(

Consequently, the insurance inspector came and agreed it needed to be done
again....so with that and then opting for a 1303 'box and straight axles as
I couldn't afford to get the redux boxes rebuilt....well, it's still
languishing under cover. By the time it was done it was MOT time, and the
visibly-collapsed jacking point wouldn't have passed - so it's waiting for
pay day to come for that also. We're hoping to get to France this
summer...well, what else can go wrong? (Don't answer that!)
