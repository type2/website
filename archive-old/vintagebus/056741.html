Subject: ***Stolen vehicle News****

--part1_14c.aef8c34.29cd102d_boundary

Now after talking to a buddy a few weeks ago and finding out this crap is 
still going on I decided to dig a little deeper into (not) why these vehicles 
are being stolen (we own them we know why we love them)  but as to why they 
are not being recovered.  I said screw the local police departments, they are 
to busy looking for benzs and beemers if that.  I hooked up with a buddy an 
ex-customs  agent I met on a previuos tour, and found out some disturbing 
news. Volkswagens in the orient Japan, China, etc. have seen a 75% in the 
last 5-7 years.  Some of these vehicles have been shipped two or three times, 
same chasis numbers at least.  Also from everyone I've checked with and I 
know some of you know me from different parts of the world, we are not 
selling that many V-dubs to asian decent buyers.  My buddy is no longer 
working full time but said he will have another good friend monitor any 
unusual activities.  Seems that Cali vehicles are being a shipped out of the 
east coast and the other way around.  I promise to let you know if I here any 
specifics, but you guys might also no someone that works at a port or 
warehouse and just might know what to be looking for.  Be careful some of 
these guys are having titles made before the vehicle is even stolen, meaning 
they are doing homework at shows, repair shops, junkyards, etc, pretty deep 
stuff guys and gals.
