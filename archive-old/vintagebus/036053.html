Well folks its Friday, and time for our favorite game &quot;Fun with Flaming&quot;!!

So let it begin!



There are some of us out here in St. Louis, and various members of the &quot;Bus

Butts&quot; club that whole-heartedly believe in the theory that any AVAILABLE

woman who drives a Vw bus is clinically insane.



This theory has been arrived at over many years of personal case studies

conducted across the country.   There are conditions however, to the

insanity rule:

1) The woman must be AVAILABLE and own a bus

2) If the woman was not into busses, but became an enthusiast AFTER hookin'

up with a man into VW's, she WILL NOT be insane.

3) If the afore-mentioned woman should for some reason leave that particular

man and once again become available, she then BECOMES INSANE

4) If she get back with another man, she does not become sane again, ONCE

INSANE, ALWAYS INSANE.



Now, by insanity I don't mean stab you in the shower psycho stuff here, just

very subtle quirks and issues with the world that leaves a fella freaked and

generally miffed at the world in general.

I almost completely agree, and have notice such an effect.  How refreshing to
have this validated and brought out into the open.     Three cheers!!!

there is one point on which I disagree - she herself does not become insane-
it is more than the fellas who become &quot;freaked and generally miffed at the
world in general&quot; are the ones who become insane.   She walks (drives the bus)
around, enjoying life and fahrfurgnugen (sp?), throwing off rays which may
cause insanity in others who are susceptable to such things....   particularly
people who refuse to see things that are right in front of them.       They
should get over it.   
 
  sounds like a good thing.   :)
