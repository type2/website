&gt; &gt; &quot;The pop top is somewhat ridged and is looong.  Almost the 
&gt; entire length of the
&gt; &gt; bus roof&quot;

&gt; I don't know what a Devon is.  Sounds English...lots of Englanders in
&gt; Canada.  A correlation?  Not sure.  Does the Devon have about 3 or 4
&gt; rather large ridges that protrude upward from the top..most likely for
&gt; strength???

Devon is English, probably the most widespread in the UK, even that Westys
which were more expensive...not that we're cheapskates or anything :)

I couldn't say for sure, but most of the Devons I know actually have a flat
roof with a vertical side, and a seal around the join. Not with ridges at
all.

And I've Got a Canterbury Pitt conversion....there's another one you've
never heard of!
