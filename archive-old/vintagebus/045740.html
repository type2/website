&lt;&lt; Yesterday I adjusted the valves and put new plugs, plug wires, Pertronix 
40k
 coil and Pertronix ignitor in my 1966 Deluxe 21-window bus with a 1600sp.
 Once I got everything in and did the timing she purred like a kitten. I
 drove the bus all weekend with no problems until this afternoon as I'm
 driving along to work, I loose all power to the bus. No juice to the dash at
 all, as if there wasn't a battery. With some help from a good samaritan, I
 pushed the bus out of traffic, to a no parking zone, and hitched a ride to
 work.
 
 I think I must have fired a fuse somewhere but I'm clueless. Any thoughts or
 suggestions on any quick easy fixes would be greatly appreciated. I have had
 no problems with my battery recently and just a few minutes earlier, the
 dash warning lights were glowing bright as ever when I fired the bus up.
 BTW, she was starting first time every time!
  &gt;&gt;

so, do any of the electrics work?  headlights?  was your gen light glowing 
before this bus slowed, that could be a sign of worn out generator brushes.   
Check your fuses and look for loose wires that came off in the engine 
compartment, check your battery connections/ ground.   I betcha a donut it's 
a simple fix.
