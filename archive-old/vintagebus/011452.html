So, I have a sad tale to tell about my poor, poor bus.  
I just got back from a weekend of hard driving up gravel mountain roads, 
and was all ready to pick up my little sister for her birthday.  Then, 
the driver behind me pointed out to me that my rear driver's side wheel 
looked like it was going to fall off.
So I got out and took a look and yes, indeed, the wheel is on somewhat 
of a strange angle.  So I look and look and finally discover the source 
of this unfortunate situation.  My bus is a '66 that some idiot put an 
IRS bug tranny in, very poorly.  So what happened is that the arm that 
is welded to the torsion bar tube to hold the wheel in place is no 
longer welded on. (the welds snapped) So the only thing holding my wheel 
on is the springplate.  Oh, this is bad, bad, bad.  
Now, this is one hurting bus to begin with.  The rear shock mounts broke 
quite some time ago, due to the fact that the IRS installation guy 
didn't bother to put new shock mounts on and his mickey mouse shock 
attachment method just didn't work at all.  So I'm thinking that by the 
time I fix all these things, I'll have spent more money than I paid for 
the bus and it'll still be a rusty old hippy bus with a screwed up rear 
end.  
Conclusion:  I need a new bus, bad.  My motor is excellent, though, so 
I'm looking for a '71 or earlier with a blown motor.  It should be 
driveable but probably pretty rusty/dented as I can only afford the 
lowest of prices.  It is breaking my heart to give up my splitty but I  
think I'll have to.  On the brighter side, a friend of a friend MIGHT be 
willing to trade me a motorless bubble window for the remains of my 
split.  And I'm going to try to get down to the vintage meet in Seattle 
this weekend, although I suspect asking prices to be way out of my 
range.
Anyway, thanks for listening to my sad tale.

Crying in Vancouver,
Diana
