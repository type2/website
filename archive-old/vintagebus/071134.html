Subject: RE: [VB] Truck show class

Ya know, when I took the tipper down for the octo/classic weekend last
year, I was parked with all the normal folk at octo because people
didn't realize what I was actually driving when they ushered me into the
show, and then at octo, I was put in the back of the CH show area.  I
really didn't mind that much since I know it gave people a surprise when
strolling through rows of busses and then to come upon the tipper with
the bed up.   Sure, it's nice to be in front row but I really believe if
your *rig* is worth seeing, it WILL be noticed AND appreciated.  Most of
the populous relates to the deluxe bus so even if you were in front row
with your truck, they'd merely pass you by.

I say don't sweat it and enjoy the show.


BTW, for the 'split window' thread, how 'bout the term 'rig' :-O
