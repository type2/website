&gt;WOW, just like RAMVA no Tech, all BS :)

Nope, we don't have all of the porn spam and the SUPER off-topic crap.  And
I can lock down the membership if I want to cut down on abusers.  Like I
said, we've GOT 2 rules! ;)

I think it's better than RAMVA.  But I may be parentally biased.

Check it out, and MODERATORS, send your blabbery, seemingly pointless
threads over our way.  We're glad to host them!

Your pen-pal,
