Joe,
   I had a helicoil in one of my heads once (bought a set of reconditioned
heads). It blew out inside of 6 months. I think it was because it came
loose.
   If you have the time and space, I would pull the head. I have seen guys
use the spark plug to put them in. I've never seen a tool. The only problem
is when you try to remove the plug the hole thing will come out. To help
prevent this, after you put the coil in, tap the top edge of it with a
punch. Don't use a BFH, all you need to do is set the coil to the head. You
don't want to knock a hole in it. This will help keep the coil from backing
out.
