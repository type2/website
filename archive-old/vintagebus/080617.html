Subject: Re: [VB] jerome... dog friendly?

&gt; ok, from what i can see, jerome is basically a flat spot of dirt
&gt; where you camp.

Yes, &amp; very rocky.

 any one bring dogs in the past, and was the heat/sun
&gt; a problem?

Not if you have some shade.

 is there shade at all?

Not unless you bring it.

 i would rather leave the dog at home......
........... he's well-behaved, so that's not the problem; but a black dog in
&gt; the AZ sun is not always a good idea.

We brought our 4 month old Great Pyrenees puppy last year &amp; had no problem
dog wise.  However, he was more appropriate than some of the adjacent
campers. Not sure I will convince the wife to accompany moi again this year,
but the dog wants to go!

This is in no way meant to disparage the Jamboree, which is the biggest/most
organized/ fun bus campout I attend each year, but if you are in the wrong
neighborhood at Jerome, it can be eye opening.

FWIW,

Tom Buese-going again this year in the DC
