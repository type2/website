Subject: Re: [VB] wanted: overhead vent screws!

He doesnt need the plate on to prevent air from
entering the bus. I have the new seal that goes
between the two pieces of metal and I have little to
no drafts (depends on how hard I push down on the
lever). I still need to glue in the foam core seal and
re-install the plate.
 Mike

&gt; The way I read it, is he didn't have the plate
&gt; installed at all...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The plate and the screws will not prevent drafts,
&gt; its
&gt; &gt; the flap and the seals that you need to fix. The
&gt; plate
&gt; &gt; is only removable to service these items.
