&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; RE: '59 Kombi, 1600 DP engine, recently overhauled, about 3000 miles 
&gt; on the engine. I had the heads rebuilt when i overhauled the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; I was having trouble with my engine and it turned out the #3 intake 
&gt; valve was tight. i adjusted it to .006 and drove it a total of maybe 
&gt; 3 days (150 miles). Engine acting bad again. Turns out #3 intake 
&gt; valve is tight again. So I just adjusted it once again to .006.

Your valve stem is probably stretching, which is what they do immediately
before the head breaks off and dances on your piston.

Time to pop those heads!
