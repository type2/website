&gt; My '67 21 Window doesn't have the rear interior
&gt; light installed. I guess the guy that restored it
&gt; missed it. I pulled back the headliner behind the
&gt; sun roof, and the mounting holes look fine.
&gt; I bought a new light, but I need to know how
&gt; the wire gets from the switch on the LH side
&gt; of the speedo to the light.  That switch is currently
&gt; wired in series with the front interior light.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Tom.

It goes up the left hand side at the front of the windscreen. Then along the 
rail at the bottom of the roof windows. The switch is for the rear light only 
as you can turn the front light of when driving just by turning around, the 
power is taken from the switch though. Mike
