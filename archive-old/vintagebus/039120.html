This has probably been covered a million times... but,
My bus is a 12volt (64 Standard), it has the original gas gauge which hasn't
worked since I bought it.  My husband took it apart and hooked it up... he
has a few years of electrical experience, but of course not with *rusty old
buses*
When you turn the key on the needles moves all the way to full and when you
turn the key off, it drops back down to E.  Got any suggestions on how to
get this thing working so I don't have to keep guessing how much gas I have?
Thanks!
