Subject: Who ownes a Westy tow hitch?  Please email me.

If you own a original westy tow hitch or have any
first hand knowledge of them can you please email me.
(direct)  I am gathering info on the differences
between the years.  I know of 3 distinctly different
versions thru the years right now and want to compile
any others.

So far i know there is:
1.  A Barn Door version that was adapted for a press
bumper and a round tube trany cradle.  Built around
1961.

2.  A post BS version with the main torsion bar
runners very wide (about 30&quot;) and having no connecting
structure between them.  Built in the mid 60's
probably from 1962-1966.

3.  Most common version which looks the same as #2 but
the torsion bar mounts are closer together (about 10&quot;)
and there is a cross piece between the 2.  Built from
1967 thru at least 1975.

All of these have different Westfalia tag's.  I know
the original Westfalia installation manual is dated
1959 so i think that is the first year they were
probably built.  All of the units have a date stamp
and thanks to Robert i also know they all had VW part
#'s both painted and applied to them.  They were also
black.  The earliest actual date stamp i have seen is
1961.  I also know there are Westy hitches for bug and
also Type 3's.

Also,  There was a electrical connection unit for
these.  (See my other post)  There are 2 styles i know
of right now.  There is also available a ball cover. 
One is chrome metal that does not cover the whole ball
but just the rear or it and the other is still being
made and is plastic.  (If anyone has a metal one i
would like to talk to you about it)

There are at least 2 other makers of hitches that
looked like the Westy.  One was Peka (which i use to
have) and the other i am not sure of the name. 
Something like Otis.  There are also the VOA bumper
units and i also have a VOA style torsion mount unit. 
(Plus many home built jobs.)

Anyone out there have any other info?  

Thanks
Matt


Thanks
Matthew
