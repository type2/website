&lt;&lt;Kyle, I like the plasma cutter idea! In fact, I printed your advice, and 
placed it(as an amendment) in my Muir manual. I think I might need that 
procedure in the near future.&gt;&gt;

Best way to remove a steering wheel is to take the plasma cutter and cut a
hole in the roof. Hook the come-a-long to the wheel and winch the bus up in
the air from the branch of a tree, then start jumping up and down on the
front bumper. If you don't have a plasma cutter, you could try a steering
wheel puller.
