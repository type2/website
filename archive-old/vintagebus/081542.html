Subject: help for the new old guy

OK guys be nice I am new again to this vw thing. I have bought a bay 68
truck, it has been sitting at least 15 years. Now for the question it
has a (1972  I think) 1600 dp engine the engine # AE 425265 with a 34
pict-3 carb. I have removed the engine and heating tin to remove mice
nest and the like. The engine will turn freely by I have not turn it
more than a half turn. The oil breather had been removed so the critters
also went into the carb. I removed the valve covers to inspect there
condition which was positive no rust.  I was wondering if anyone would
help me in the &quot;correct&quot; direction I should take in bringing this back
to life. Now the owner said that it did run before it was parked and
that his father was having a little carburetor trouble with the engine.
I have taken many of these engines apart but this was years ago. After
you stop laughing any help would be cool.
