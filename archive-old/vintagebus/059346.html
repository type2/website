Yeah...I'm a member of that club.  My daughter got one for her birthday last 
weekend.  The parent said, they'd seen my bus before and figured me and my 
daughter would like it.  Hehe, it is kinda cool,  sure beats the Barbie new 
beetle =)

Whos yur daddy,

&gt; My daughter just brought one of those home last week...cool in a strange
&gt; way.  Kinda of a bus with a major top hack.  Still, it does have the split
&gt; fronts.  Wonder how long all the toy freeks will be hording them and then
&gt; trying to pawn them off at the next swap for 3 times the price.....?

&gt; Saw an ad in today's paper for this characature of a single cab.  I guess
&gt; orange is the New Black as fashion police would say.
