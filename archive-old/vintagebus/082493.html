Subject: Re: Pimp my ride

&gt;That kid struck me as kind of a goober and if I were him I would sell the 
&gt;dryer, the TV, pretty much all of that electrical system, that surfboard 
&gt;ejection wierdness, etc. That could bring him about $10,000 And he could 
&gt;afford to repair the louvre damage and the dash damage, take the interior 
&gt;out carefully, fix all the interior rust, put the interior back(?), have 
&gt;the engine and all the mechanicals worked on and he'd have a very nice bus. 
&gt;Maybe he should just sell it now before the rust gets back to the surface.
&gt;


so if he did all this, why the heck did he even go on the show? some of you 
are being rediculous!! some young kid has a bus he loves and it got a 
makeover... went from a beater to something cool that im sure him and all 
his friends will REALLY enjoy. isnt that what its all about?! who cares 
about the bondo, its sill on the road, thats what matters. some of us want 
to drive our buses instead of having them in various states of restoration 
for 15 years never to move more than 20 feet at a time.
