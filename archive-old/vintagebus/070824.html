Subject: re:driver seat padding

do all seats have this adjustment knob? I have never seen this, nor any
remnants of it on the seats of my '65 kombi(camper conversion to ez-camper).

&gt;  Hi Paul,
&gt; Do you have the driver 1/3 seat adjusted properly???  There should be two
&gt; adjstment knobs at the base/hinge area where the upper section of the seat
meets
&gt; the base part.  These knobs should be adjusted so the seat back is
straight
up
&gt; or even slightly tilted forward.

Hi Eric&amp;Barb,

Once again you have come to my rescue - this was indeed the problem.  Never
even noticed that adjustment before!  Adjusted it and it feels so much nicer
to drive!  Mine were at odd positions too - doubt that would of helped.

&gt;&gt;And how do I remove the covers - is this a job for an upholsteror? &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt;You can definitely do it yourself!

Well as I have ordered the new padding I might as well do it now anyway.

Thanks
Paul
