Subject: Re: [VB] Keys

Hi azurbancowboy,
Depends on a few factors.  Is this an all original VW, or all the  locks 
differant?  Usually the rear hatch lock is in the best condition, and  least 
likely to have been changed.  Keeping this in mind, remove that one,  the cargo, 
and driver handles.  The key code should be on each  handle.  Are they all the 
same, or not?  If not, you are going to have  to figure which key code you want 
to go with.  At that point you might  want to remove the ignition switch 
(disconnect the battery first), and compare  the code to the door handles.  If 
some of the door handles are the same  key code as the ignition you probably will 
want the differant coded handles  either replace if they are for a differant 
key profile, or the tumbler pins  changed to match the other locks if the key 
profile is the same.  As for  where to get key blanks.  Most good locksmith 
shops will have them, but if  you want the VW logoed keys you will need to go to 
swap meets or contact a  locksmith specializing in VWs through Thesamba_dot_com  
.  You did  not mention what year of bus you have.  From 1955-early 1964 the 
key for  these year buses was the same, but for whatever reason the letter 
changed  several times.  From later 1964-67 the key profile was a &quot;T&quot;.  This  
letter will be before the key code on each handle and ignition code.
  Any good locksmith will cut the key by only the key code, not using  the 
old worn out key itself.
