&gt; Going down the big hill hit the brakes.  Hard pull to the left.  Felt
&gt; like the right front didn't release all the way.

If the right front isn't doing anything when you step on the brakes,
then the Bus should pull left.  If the right front is dragging, the Bus
should have a little pull to the right.

&gt; Onto the main highway, could really feel the brake grabbing.  After 4
&gt; miles on the highway I pulled over to let the RF brake cool and release
&gt; because the brake wasn't releasing.

Did you (carefully) put a hand down by all 4 brake drums to check that
it was the right front one heating up?

&gt; I'm thinking that either I have a lump of dookie in the line to the RF
&gt; brake

This can include the rubber hose disintegrating on the inside.
BTDTGTTS.  One way to tell: drive it until the RF is starting to drag
pretty good, come back home, and put the front end up on jack stands.
Spin the tire with your hand to see how hard it is to turn.  Then, crack
open the bleeder valve on that wheel.  If the tire gets easy to turn when
you do this, then there is probably some blockage between the master
cylinder and that wheel.  If the wheel stays tight, it is probably some
problem inside the RF brake drum: piston seizing in caliper, brakes
adjusted too tight.

&gt; or the master cylinder push rod is too tight.

I'd think this would tend to make _all_ your brakes drag, not just the
right front.  On the other hand, if the right front was adjusted with
the shoes a lot closer to the drum than the left front, then as the
push rod applies the brakes for you, it would show up on the right
front first.
