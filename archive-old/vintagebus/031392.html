Subject: Re: [VB] Stretchy belt...?

&gt;From some quick calcs, going from a 4.125 r&amp;p to a 4.375 r&amp;p will drop your
speed around 5 mph at the same rpm.

I'm not trying to be &quot;right&quot;, or trying to prove you wrong, just like to give
accurate information when ever possible.

So, when do we get drunk;&lt;)

&gt; to say it's a good combo that does bad things. I have only had two buses
&gt; that went from bus centers to bug centers, and on both of them the top speed
&gt; dropped 5 miles per hour at the same rpm's. Other gears weren't affected
&gt; much. Neither were split cases, before or after. Obviously I paid to much
&gt; attention to the speed before and after and not enough to gearing numbers.
