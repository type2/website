The two 15&quot; rims came with the bus when purchase.  The PO put them under the 
rear because it squated badly,  so I adjusted the tor. bars and plates got 
it back up.  Got the orig. 14&quot; back there now,  it was just an idea at the 
time on how things would handle.  It is my impression that the ride with 
15&quot;ers all the way around would be better than the 14&quot;s.  But ofcoarse I 
should have started in the archives.

Does anybody have a pair of 15&quot; rims they would like to get out of there 
way?
