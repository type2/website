short version...

In case anyone was wondering, the '54 Kombi made it back from the OCTO 
meet and the VW Classic under it's own power.

I'm glad I brought my spare barndoor tranny, because the tranny locked 
up in 2 gears at once in Little Rock, Arkansas.  Between the one that 
locked up and the spare, there were enough parts to make a running 
tranny &amp; we were back on the road after about 7 hours of engine pulling, 
tranny pulling, cussing, tranny repair, &amp; installation.

5000+ miles &amp; only one mechanical failure.

Drive your bus!

Dave
