Subject: Re: [VB] help on engine black paint

I am interested in a product that is gas and oil resistant....
that's the question.
----------------------- Clip -----------------------
The easy out is to use Rustoleum in the spray can or by the bulk can.
I've had and used it on many Vanagons and fuel / oil doesn't hurt it.
It has stood up to the heat above the muffler and on heat exchanger
exteriors for 8 years.
You might just paint a few test pieces and try them for a week before you
make your final decision.
