Subject: Re: [VB] Queen of all strange bus sounds

In damp weather sometimes E-brakes stick, particularly if the bus hasn't been 
driven much recently.   Normally this works itself out with driving/use of 
brakes.  More dramatic measures need to be taken if the bus won't roll, ie use 
of large hammer on drum  (NOT rim), sometimes removing wheel and hitting the 
outside of a rim with a mallet till it rings true, and sometimes even then 
removing the drums and sanding any rust off.  But again, this works itself out with 
regular driving if it breaks loose and the bus drives.  I have found this 
happen once in a while even with a normally driven bus here in the soggy PNW.   
the morning after I drove it, even.

FWIW, if you find that the bus sits for a while, or have a project/non 
running bus, make sure the ebrake it released, or the shoes can get well rusted to 
the drums, making it hard to roll the bus/remove the drums, and get the bus 
back on the road again.   Block the wheels if necessary, and curb the front 
wheels like you were parking in SF.
