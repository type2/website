Subject: Re: [VB] 67 Flywheel confusion HELP ME!!

It sounds like your 67 bus had an earlier tranny in it.   As it is usual for 
the tranny to have been replaced in an old bus, don't freak out.    It is 
likely that for some reason a PO used a 6V FW .  annoying.   This means it 
probably has a 6V starter, maybe or maybe not, with a 12V solenoid.   So pull the 
starter, and check to see if it is 12V or 6V.   You probably need to buy a 12V 
starter, a 12V into 6V tranny starter bushing, install them, and then it should 
work.    * Both *  cylinders of the starter should say 12V.   

The 12V FW teeth don't mesh with the 6V starter teeth, you see.   

Did you compare the old FW to the new FW?

Maybe you can get the starter out of the bus the motor came out of.

I am trying to put a 71 engine (1600 DP) into a 67
bus.  Since both 71 and 67 were 12 volt systems, I
assumed it would just be a straight bolt on situation,
but NOT!!  First off, I find that the flywheel is too
big for the bell housing on the 67 tranny. WTF?!?! 
OK, maybe for some reason the 67 bus (confirmed by the
VIN that it is a 67) has an older tranny in it. So
grind away the bell housing to make the flywheel fit.
Engine goes in and will turn by hand, good sign. But
when I electrify the starter (which is a 12 Volt
starter) I get a click and then nothing. The starter
is hanging up on the flywheel. Again, WTF??
