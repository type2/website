&gt;OK, y'all have convinced me.  I'll buy four.&lt;


I would get 5.

You want rear tires to match closely in size so it does not harm the tranny. 
  Likely hood of damage is small if only driving it for a little bit, but on 
an extended road trip this could be an issue.

Plus peace of mind knowing you have a good spare helps when going off road.

Just in general it is a good idea to splurge on tires after all it is the 
easiest way to increase the performance of your bus.  Both in turns and 
stopping.  Good tires are not cheap, that is just the way it is.

BTW Tire Rack has always done me well.

Good Luck,
Adrian &quot;tire Nazi&quot; Pillow
