&lt;&lt; I stumbled across a catalog and it's great.  Lots of pictures of parts (for
 us visual people) and the prices seem to be good also.  You can get a free
 catalog _at_ http:\\www.motorworks_dot_com
 
 If you all know about them and they are &quot;no good&quot; let me know so I dont
 screw myself.

Jason,

I imagine most everyone knows about them Keep in mind, there are some other
companies out ther that act as distributors for these guys as well as some of
the other big ones and sell the same stuff at discount. Weird kind of system!
