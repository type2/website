&gt; Can you use the Stock 67 MC if you buy a Proportioning (?) Valve?

HI Dave,
From what we understand you have to use a MC for disc brakes.  The disc 
slaves (wheel cylinders) in the calipers require a larger volume of brake 
fluid than a no disc brake MC can provide.
  The proportioning valve insures that the front brakes will lock up well 
before the rears.  Otherwise without this valve the rears will lock up first 
because drum brake require less pressure than disc to do so and the VW will 
either spin out or at the least end up suddenly facing backwards.
