Subject: stupid electrical question

Hi again!
The PO converted my 66 6V to 12V generator.  It doesn't appear that any
of the electrical system (except coil, regulator, etc.) are switched and
I don't find any step downs.  Everything is stripped from the rig.  How
can this be?  I don't understand how all this stuff can still run (like
lights) with 6V bulbs...

As I move to re-assemble, I would like to go to an alternator for better
electrical efficiency.

Knowing that Everything is out, I am going to an alternator, and I can
replace things easily, what should I put in as 12V?

TIA
