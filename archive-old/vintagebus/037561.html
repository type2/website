I know this subject has been wandering around this message board, but I still 
can't remember how they work. Specifically I am trying to decipher the date 
codes on the back of a speedometer. If there is a web site the explains it, 
please send me the link, or if you know off the top of your head . . . Next to 
a VW symbol is W 0.77, but there is also a 2,61 stamped on the back. I am 
guessing that it is February 1961 Speedo, but I could be wrong. Here is the 
part number too, if it helps at all: 211957023B (so the speedo is for a Bus, 
right?). If you could e-mail me directly I would appreciate it. Thanks for the 
help.
