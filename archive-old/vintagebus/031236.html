Subject: Hot times in Phoenix!!

&quot;Simmer&quot; is here in Phoenix--The AriZona VW Bus club had a pool party last week and it was
a great way to have a club meeting--Hot Dogs and Burgers were on the the ABC,  and
everyone brought a side dish--A lot of the side dishes were Beans--which made for a rip
snorting time in the pool--Many thanks to Pat Kelly and Jon Stanton--stay tuned for pics--

Progress going well on my 1960DC--Magoo and i pulled all the side panels and resprayed
them--it used a LOT more paint then i thought--as the panels were very worn --We 1st
sprayed on a lacquer
gray primer to seal the surface--then covered that with a vinyl dye--It really turned
quite nice and the total cost to spray the 7 panels in the DC was around $48--The vinyl
spray is a little pricey at around $8.00 per can--My only complaint, is that we found a
very close match to the grey inside orginal color in the vinyl paint--But when it came out
of the can, it was a shade lighter--the base coat was a dark grey paint--so that was not
the problem--But the fact that the ceiling panels never come next to the ones we sprayed
makes it OK--And it is a truck--All in all we are both very satisfied with the
result--Magoo again was right there with me--The &quot;New&quot; hip so far is holding up--but i
still need a cane to walk straight--See all of you at the next Pomona--and i still have
that extra 1960DC rear seat assembly, but no pedestal, for Sale or Trade??  TWWM, uj
