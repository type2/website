Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Belt-eating crank pulley

George had lots of good ideas for getting the pulley off. Here is one more. 
Crack the bolt loose and turn it out about 1 turn. Tap the head of the bolt 
with a small sledge and the pulley should walk out the bot head. keep 
backing the bolt out and tapping. Keep in mind that if you tap too hard, the 
threads on the bolt will deform. This is a fair tecnique for starting the 
removal. Once the pulley is moving, use a large gear puller.
