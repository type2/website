Subject: [VB] New complete harness
Message-ID: &lt;385F7926.2B32_at_lava_dot_net&gt;

Hello,
   I was just wondering if anyone had any good suggestions or experience
replacing their wiring harness?  I'm about to tackle that on my 67 kombi
in a day or two and could use any advice on the subject. 
    About how long has it taken any of you who have done this?  
   Oh, does anyone know how to get a hold of old bus jacks?  Mine did'nt
come with one and I'm realizing they are'nt growing on my mango tree out
back.  VW does'nt sell those things anymore do they? Or do they?
   Any help is appreciated.  
 ---J.D.
