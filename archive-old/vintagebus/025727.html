Subject: 2000lb Torque Wrench &amp; City Update
Message-ID: &lt;378F5FFB.F9286C7C_at_dolphinsci_dot_com&gt;

Since it is Friday, I thought I would fill all of you in on my trip to
what could be called the world's largest candy store for the home
mechanic.  Monday, I had the opportunity to check out equipment that is
coming available for auction at the now defunct Long Beach Naval
Shipyard.  I examined 5 floors of electronic equipment of almost every
kind.  An entire calibration lab of equipment.  It was an incredible
sight with rows upon rows of test equipment that will be going out the
door.  The first floor had an array of dynamometers one of them was in
the 1000's HP range. HUGE.

Then we were treated to the tool 'shack' that supplied all the
ocean-going ships and their on-board machine shops.  10s of thousands of
square feet of every hand tool, bit, clamp, air tool, electric hand
tool, known to man.  If it was not in there, I would venture to say that
it has not been made yet.  An example of the quantity, I stood in front
of a 6' x 3' cabinet with slide out shelves (industrial sized toolbox)
and every drawer was filled with phillips screwdrivers.

Now to the torque wrench.  I was over in the north corner of the
building looking at the 3', 4' &amp; 6' calipers and micrometers when I came
across some large torque wrenches.  They had handles about 5' long and
1.25&quot; diameter.  It was no small chore to lift it up and I found out
that it was a 400 to 2000 ft-lb torque wrench.  The other instructor I
was with, laughed and said &quot;I bet you'd like that to work on your VW
with&quot;.

It was a morning of complete sensory overload.  I did end up putting
together a two page spread sheet with equipment that we will be putting
in a request for to be used at the college.

CITY UPDATE:  I got another notice from the city last week and this one
was a formal &quot;move the bus in 10 days or we will and destroy it and
charge you...  oh by the way, you can request a formal hearing&quot;.  I
called the lady at the city and she was reasonable, but apparently the
person who filed the original complaint called back and wondered why the
bus was still there.  I explained that my tranny was about to be shipped
&gt;from Washington (Todd Hill sent it Wednesday) and the engine was on the
stand just waiting for the tranny.  I requested a formal hearing and she
said that it would take a week or two to get a date.  I told her if she
pushed it out to two weeks, I should be able to drive the truck to the
meeting.  She agreed noting that its unusual for some one to ask the
city to go slow.  So if UPS comes through next week, I'll be feverishly
installing it and the engine and making the double cab road worthy by
the end of the month.

I told my neighbor that I'm considering getting a couple of butt-ugly
beater busses, making sure they can run, license and insure them and
then drive them every third day just to piss off the whiner that is
complaining about my truck.

I better stop before I start ranting and screaming.
