Subject: Re: [VB] Double Cab Bed Floors, and Double Cab parts Help.

I was ignorant to the fact that there are &quot;Pointy&quot; and &quot;Roundy&quot; pods and am 
at work so I cannot look at the pod in my '61 to describe it, but I do know 
that there is no hole for the dome light switch.  The rear cab sheet metal 
support does have the mouning holes and the larger hole for the dome light, 
but have never had anything screwed into them (paint is still there and 
smooth).  And since you mention it, the door panels do have the pockets in 
them.  Also, wasn't '61 a split year for the &quot;screw terminals vs the push on 
terminals?
