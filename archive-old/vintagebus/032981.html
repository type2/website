Hi Clara,
Right and the fogging is caused from water getting into past the seal and
attacking the plastic laminate between the two layers of glass.  Thusly the
reason that old safety glass will have the white fogging in it on the bottom
of the glass where the water collects due to gravity.  Eric&amp;Barb

so especially is you have new glass cut, put some oil or roofling tar in the
seal where the glass goes.     I use oil mostly, it makes it very  quick and
easy to put the seal on the glass.  theory that it will help repel water from
gathering in the seal and climbing up into the laminate.
