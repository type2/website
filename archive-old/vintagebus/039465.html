  I was just curious as to what parts were differant between european and 
american model buses in say 1965?I have seen alot of early buses with 
differant tail lights and bumpers,and of course opposite stearing.
  The reason I ask is one of my Air Force buddies has moved to Germany and I 
have a good hook up for parts.My bus is a basket case and I plan on builing 
a custom out of it,I thought some differant parts might be cool!
