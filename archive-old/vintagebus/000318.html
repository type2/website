Was Writ:
&lt;&lt;Are these reverse lights or fog lights? If they are reverse can I install a 
switch under
the dash so I don't have to drill into the tranny&gt;&gt;

If they have clear lenses they would be backup lights.

Go back and see if there is a sending unit on the speedometer where the cable 
is attached.  Sometimes it has HELLA stamped on it.  When this unit senses 
the speedo cable is rotating in the reverse direction it activates the lights.
