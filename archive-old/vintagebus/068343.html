Subject: Re: [VB] shipping deluxe trim

Hi everyone,
Unfortunately the piece is the passenger rear corner for my 15-window.

That's why I'd rather not have it shipped.
Maybe someone close to me has one and can bring it to Kelly Park!!!  Or even
Red Barn.

See everyone then.

&gt; I agree with you, sounds like a bad idea, though I heard that people do
it.
&gt;
&gt; i assume you're paying for the shipping, so it's up to you right?  Did n't
&gt; you say it was a door piece... that's not so big to put in a package

&gt; &lt;&lt; Has any body had experience with deluxe trim that's been rolled so it
can
&gt; be
&gt;  shipped.
&gt;  I found the last missing piece for my bus, but seems that people want to
roll
&gt;  the trim.
&gt;  Doesn't sound like a good idea to me. I've talked to others that don't
think
&gt;  it's a good idea.
