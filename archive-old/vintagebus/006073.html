Hey list,
Many months ago, someone posted a product endorsement that caught my
attention.

It is a penetrating oil for really nasty stuckage called

KROIL   or Silikroil(with silicon lube)

I ordered a gallon off the net last week, it came and

IT WORKS

wd40 is junk, this stuff loosens and lubes fast

I went around squirting all the stuck door hinges, latches, etc.

They all freed up within minutes.

I'm impressed with the stuff
