Subject: Re: [VB] front seat area? 

i have never heard of a factory sunroof bus without belly pans. even sunroof
standards and westy dormobiles got the pans. do your m-codes back it up?
engine bay vin match the others?


&gt; As an aside I have a 67 Samba Non walk through sliding door model.  There
are
&gt; no belly pans fitted nor can I see any sign of them being fitted. I  was
told
&gt; all Sambas had belly pans. Is this another urban myth? Mike
