Subject: 28MPG on freeway in Frodo the 65 Westy?

Ok Terry,

I need to know the details here.  How do you drive on the freeway?  What
speed (and is your speedo correct)?

I have a 1600 dual port and my 67 westy gets 18MPG on long highway trips.  I
drive at 68 to 70MPH... so I know that hurts, but I've also slowed down to
60 for 1 tank and saw little improvement (maybe 19MPG).  I've also run stock
carb and now Dual Kadrons (known for good MPG)... and almost exact same
usage.

Seeing someone who gets 28MPG with a 65 Westy... I know I must be doing
something different.  Not like I slow down and accelerate a lot on the
freeway... I just go a steady speed (wind and hills permitting).

Is this very flat land?  Windy conditions?  Tires you use?  Transaxle?
Whatever you can tell me.

My last tank gave me nearly 28 mpg. Dick Bozarth of Omaha built
me a very sweet motor and I can never thank him enough for that.
