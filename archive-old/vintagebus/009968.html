Subject: Drive Away Tent OEM / NFS

List-
I just got a new Drive Away Tent, dated Aug. '69.
This one has only been erected twice and is as new
as i will ever find. While the canvas is perfect, the poles
are not, they have problems with what i assume is shellac
and i'm considering clear powdercoat as the solution to that.
I don't show but would like to know if i should do that or leave
them alone. The color will not be the same, and i will lose the
&quot; original unrestored &quot; look but powdercoat will be durable.
