Subject: Help with steering wheel

I tried to remove my steering wheel all this weekend and i was unable to do it.
I had checked 
the type2 archives several times and tried several different methods and i was
still unable to 
remove my steering wheel.. I would like to replace my steering wheel as mine is
in really bad 
condition. I am at the point that i am willing to pay someone to remove my
steering wheel for 
me. Please email me if you can help i live in Pomona California.
