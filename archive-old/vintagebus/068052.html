Subject: i want to exchange backplate...

hello bus fanatics!!

I have 2x 1960 front backplate powdercoated im wishing to exchange for part!!
As i switched my front beam for a 66, and i was sending my 66 backplate  and
several small part for sandblast/powdercoating, i also sent the 60 backplate
as they were in really good shape.

Now, money is hard to get for everyone, so im willing to exchange those
backplate for 1960 bus part..

i need several small item:
-2 small front windows lock lactch; even the front door windows i have one
vent windows broken ..all other sigla are in bad shap but i bet i will reuse
them for now;

- any rubber seal;
- one VW front sign
- front dogleg (i still missed the driver side, i have one bad passenger side,
and one new post 64- from wolfsburg west but if i can find a correct one in
decent shape ill prefer...)
-2 rear flexible hose

-a steering wheel ivory (i broke mine when i removed it, all plastic went over
the floor damn i was angry!)

maybe i forget many other part... just write me and list them.!

i can send you picture of the backplate...

i also have the 60 s spindle and link pin for trade / sale.. alos picture of
them available... i can do package deal...
