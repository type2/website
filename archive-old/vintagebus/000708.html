Hi, a fellow I know is looking for a barndoor bus.  If you know of any for 
sale, please email him, not me.

He is Dustion Howell , email him at kafer52_at_yahoo_dot_com

 Hi Clara, we spoke a while back at the McMinneville
 show here in Oregon as I was looking for a barndoor.
 At that time you didn't know of any good busses for
 sale but I was wondering if you're aware of any
 currently? A deluxe would be cool but I'm preferring a
 standard or Kombi. 
 
 Bye, 
 Dustin Howell
