hey all,
i am going to remove the transaxle from the parts bus soon and after 
checking the archives i came up a little short. can someone kinda walk me 
through it. easiest way possible. should i remove it drum to drum? in 
pieces? also, anyone ever cut a pop-top (small) into a hardtop? im gonna 
just cut around it and weld it in as one piece. oh yea, and up front... are 
seized and crusty king &amp; links worth saving? or do they cost just as much to 
buy or rebuild... considering all the places that are hoarding them up in 
exchange for those sweet lowering beams. yeah!
thanks in advance,
Bob Margiotti
