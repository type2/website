The family and I just got back from a 1000 mile weekend trip to Houston from
Abilene this weekend. The bus performed flawlessly again!  I met fellow list
member Kevin G. hopefully his engine isn't toast. Had a great time, although
I could live without that humidity. Any place that has snails, slugs, and
salamanders running around should be called a jungle! Plenty of bugs too,
the whole bus was covered by the time we arrived Thursday night.
    I kept laughing when I seen those 'slower traffic keep right' signs
along the highway. Made me think of Thom's site. I spent just as much time
on the shoulder of the road letting people pass as I did on the road, lol.

Peace,
Jim
