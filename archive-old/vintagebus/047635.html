Subject: singlecab slat scre spacing?
To: wades_wagens_at_uswest_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I am about to put the oak slats in my 63 singlecab.
I see from the dropgates website that VW installed these with pop rivets post 
September 11960. Does anyone know the correct spacing for the rivets or can I 
do just what looks right?
Any opinions as to what looks right?
BTW I will use blind rivets and stainless washers.
