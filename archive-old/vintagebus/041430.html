Craig, 
I think this would be only maybe if you had no end-play.  IF there is
.003-.005 gap there would be no way that they would be touched.  Also
remove the o-ring if you have one in the flywheel if you have one whe
checking end-play.  I never thought about whether they get deformed if you
put too much in.  I'm sure I've never put the wrong amount in.:)  
I guess it would be possible to ridge the shims though if you put too much
in.  From the shims I've seen you can usually tell a trashed one pretty
easy.
