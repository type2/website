&gt; hey
&gt;
&gt; When I was running 12 volts to my 6 volt wiper motor it howled like
crazy -
&gt; it was really unbearable - it drownd out the 8 track.  And those wipers
just
&gt; flew back and forth so fast that occasionally the rods would pop off of
the
&gt; motor.  The little voltage drop dealie that I installed is great, GREAT,
the
&gt; motor now runs very quietly, the wipers move - maybe a little to slow -
but
&gt; they never pop off.  And the wipers stay on the glass and don't run past
it.
&gt; Those voltage drop things are quite inexpensive and unless you prefer to
go
&gt; to a two speed switch - I think the voltage drop is the answer.  The
&gt; instuctions said - I think - that it is to go between the fuse box and the
&gt; wiper switch - for some reason I seem to recall that I installed it
between
&gt; the switch and the motor - but I can't be 100% sure
