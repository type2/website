Subject: Fluted Lenses

Does anyone know much about fluted lenses?  I have a set of Bosch fluted
lenses.  They are marked with the Bosch logo a E1 inside a circle, a 4
digit number (4452 on one and 4441 on the other) below that.  The Bosch
name and then Germany Importe D'Allemagne (French??) below.

I beleive these are asymetrical lenses.  Each one is slightly different,
yet would appear to be left and right versions.
Anyone know what year these might be from?  I've got a '65, would these
be correct?

Thanks.

Steve
