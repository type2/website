Pandora's brakes (64 with 67 running gear front and rear, single circuit
master cylinder) have been pulling hard to the right lately. Tried
adjusting it out, that didn't help. Suspected contamination, installed new
shoes left side, didn't help.

Rebuild the master cylinder next? The MC in it now has very low miles but I
didn't install it, the PPO did. Everything bleeds fine, there doesn't seem
to be a blockage, and everything on the left side seems to actuate fine
with the hub off.

When I replaced the shoes on the left side there was virtually no brake
dust...yeah, rebuild the MC. Thanks for listening. =^ )

pulling on one side does not seem like the MC, but in the system.  

Are the brake hoses replaced?   When they get old they collapse in side and it
brakes unevenly.   Try bleeding the brakes- if the fluid does not come out
well at one wheel, there is likely a clog in the brake hose.     Old brakes
hoses go bad.   I had one burst once (total loss of all hydraulic brakes).
Are the ebrakes working right?

Check the wheel cylinders- if any are leaking rebuild or replace them- and all
on that axle.

be safe  :)
