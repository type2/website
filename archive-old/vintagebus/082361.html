Subject: Re: [VB] 36 dual Dells . . .

I've found sloppy tin fit to be a problem too. If you can get the tin
to snug up the way it is supposed to, it should allow the manifold to
snug up to the head.

&gt; Art Thraen rebuilt my Dells and I bought a kit from him for
 installation:  manifolds, linkage and air filters, put together by CB
 Performance, as I recall.

&gt; When I tried to put the manifold/carbs on, the dang things (manifolds)
 hit the side of the engine tin before going down over the studs, all the
 way to the ports on the heads.  Not even close to being able to snug
 them up using the nuts.

&gt; What to do?  grind off some aluminum on the manifolds, or trash some
 engine tin with a crow bar?

&gt; Have you ever noticed how aftermarket parts just plain don't fit?
 Aaarrrggghhh!!!!
