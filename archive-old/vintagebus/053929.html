Subject: Lost It


My apologies to the LIST.  My response to the flame yesterday, via the list, 
was inappropriate.  It was not the best of days yesterday so I should simply 
have shined it on and sat in the bus for a few minutes of peaceful reverie 
as I normally would rather than commit the same waste of bandwidth.  Sorry 
troops.
