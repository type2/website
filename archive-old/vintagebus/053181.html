Subject: RE: [VB] Fuel sender question...

Yes it is a good idea to check for proper ground between the sender housing
and body, especially if you are in that area checking the wire to the gauge.
However, if the casing of the sender was not grounded AND that was the only
problem then the gauge would read empty all the time.

Hi TJ,
Do you have a ground wire running from the sender to the body?  It is a must
have.
