Subject: Non walktru Jumpseat

Hey all,

Hope you all had a great weekend.  I was just wondering if anyone had a 
westy jumpseat for a non walktru...the longer 2/3 jump seat.  Also wondering 
what type of seat could be used to have a jumpbench similar looking to a Z 
bed.  I have a full width rear bench but is designed to lay against the fire 
wall panel.  Any ideas or info would be appreciated.

Thank,

Eric
