&lt;&lt; What happens is that the idle jet in these carbs supplies fuel up until 
about 3500 or 4000rpm at which point the A/C jet kicks in to supply the fuel. 
 180 is good for lower flowing engines but Ronnie said that since this engine 
will more than likely see higher revs, I better go with 200A/C's.  &gt;&gt;
Hi NQ,
Air correction jets do nothing to allow more fuel into the carb, but instead 
allow more air sucked through them into the fuel air mixture going to the 
main jet at high RPMs to keep the engine from running to rich.  So going with 
a larger A/C jet will just lean it out not enrichen it.  It may be best to go 
to the larger A/C jets for your higher RPMs to keep it from getting too rich, 
but the only way to tell would be to invest in several sizes of jets below 
and above what you already have and experiement!  Remember too much fuel can 
result in effects that are very much like too little fuel!  Eric&amp;Barb
