&gt;
&gt;Also, my wipers run R-E-A-L s-l-o-w.   I believe the PO (took me a
&gt;while to figure out that acronym!) didn't convert the wiper motor to
&gt;12v when he converted it.  What is the recommendation?  Should I put a 
&gt;&quot;reducer&quot; on it and run the existing wiper motor, and will it help the
&gt;speed?  Or is there another option?  How difficult is this?

Typically if you keep the 6v wiper motor when you convert to 12v, the
6v motor spins really really fast...until it burns out.  I think it's
more likely that the gearbox on the end of the wiper motor is full of
old grease, or the wiper blade axles are rusted up, etc.  Or maybe
the brushes in the wiper motor need replacement. 

You might look at the '65 wiring diagram on vintagebus_dot_com and make
sure the switch and motor are hooked up right.  Your Bus should have
the two-speed motor and switch, which is more wires for the PO to
get hooked up wrong.

&gt;Brings up another point, my hazards don't blink.  The big red 
&gt;light left of the steering column comes on steady.  Is this a
&gt;6v-12v related problem? 

It could be.  Your Bus would originally have been equipped with a
6v hazard and turn signal flasher (also known as the &quot;9 prong box&quot;).
This should have been changed out for a 12v version but probably
wasn't.  The PO may have replaced it with a generic 3-terminal flasher
which means the turn signals will work but not the hazards.  

The original flashers are prominently marked with their voltages.
Turn on the turn signal and follow the clicking sound.  You'll probably
find a little round metal or plastic can with two or three connections,
next to a bigger metal or plastic box with nine connections, some of
them unhooked.  If the bigger box is marked '6V', that's the old flasher
that the PO has bypassed. 

The &quot;Troubleshooting&quot; section of
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html will tell you more
about the flasher system on your Bus.

Good luck!
