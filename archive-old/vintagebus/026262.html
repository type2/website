&gt; &gt;What year bus is it?
&gt; &gt;May well have a 200 mm flywheel....
&gt;
&gt; The engine is a stock 1969 and the bus is a stock 1955 Single Cab 6 volt.

Huh?  How can it be 6 volt with a 69 engine?  Weren't 69 busses 12 volt,
therefore what was powering the accessories (the alternator and probably
engine) 12 volt as well?

&gt; Can I tell which clutch I will need before pulling the engine?  Craig
&gt; mentioned the bus has a large nut tranny...if that helps?

What difference does it make?  Pull the engine and look.  Unless you can't
do without your vehicle for a week or so.  You're going to replace it
whether you pull the engine now or a week from now.  Just make sure you
write down what needs to go into it so you won't have this problem the next
time you need to do this procedure.
