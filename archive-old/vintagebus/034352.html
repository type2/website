Well,

I haven't gnashed my teeth like that since Bob Hufford
gleefully reported his 21 window-in-a-barn find in 96!  A cycle of
anger, grief and denial followed by weeks of depression.....
In fact, I think I only just got over that one!

Surprising no-one has opened a clinic
to deal with the emotional scarring the rest
of us suffer when these finds are reported......

On a more serious note congrats and it gives us all hope to keep looking!

As an aside, has anyone on the list ever personally
seen a RHD walk-thru?

&gt; We drove 7 hours up and down the desolate wasteland of Central California
&gt; yesterday only to come up tired and empty handed.
&gt; 
&gt; It would not be so today.
