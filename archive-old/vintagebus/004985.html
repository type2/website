 The Jerome Raffle bus now has new front brakes and hoses. The wax worked
perfect. I would not have believed it if I had not done it myself. Never did
get to the rear brakes, to many great brands of beer at Kyles, ribeyes and
t-bones also. Great tip NQ, hope the Omaha VW show is a sellout. See  you
and Rob in Colo. in a few weeks.
