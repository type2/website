&gt;yep thats how i have to do it i am 6-5 and have a size 15 shoe its all
about
&gt;one leg at a time


One thing I found out when I was driving the bus Saturday is that I kept
griding gears.  I found out why...I was clutching with the middle of my foot
and ramming the toe part of my foot into the kick panel area.  After I
learned to clutch with my toes, it worked a heckuva lot better but it'll
take some getting used to.
