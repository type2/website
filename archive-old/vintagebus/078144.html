Subject: Alternative &quot;VW&quot; nose badge

Just another way to protest VWoA... Or just put it on for the cool factor :)

http://www.franklinsvwwerks_dot_com/iron-cross-items.htm

I think the emblem is cool!  I considered making one myself, until a buddy 
smacked me around and said someone is already making one :)  There went my 
shot at riches!

Currently my nose is naked because:
1. Fear of someone ripping off my good old &quot;VW&quot; emblem.
2. A small boycott of VWoA.

I like the iron cross theme at least. YMMV

Take Care,
Adrian Pillow
