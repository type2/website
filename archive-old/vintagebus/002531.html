&gt; I don't know Karl. John has replied trying to help, and your
&gt; response seems a little hostile. Your first post did not
&gt; include the info you gave in the second post. If you give
&gt; halfassed info, you get half useful help.

My original post just concerned the outer bearing and the problem I have
with a Bower bearing. Here is what I wrote&quot;

&quot;I had to replace the left outer rear wheel bearing in my 66 with reinforced
reduction boxes. This uses a roller bearing, part number 211 501 283. The
original one was a FAG, number N207E, made in Germany. I ordered one from
IMC. It came as a Bower, made in USA, with a bearing number of MU1207-CX. It
is CRAP! Even with the center nut torque at 250 ft-lbs. the drum rocks
almost a 1/4 of an inch!!!
I am removing a used one from my bad transaxle to use in this transaxle I am
putting in. It has the brand name of DWB. That is a new one on me....never
heard of it. But it also is a N207E bearing.&quot;

I got a little 'hostile' because I was trying to let people know that a
Bower 211 501 283 is a piece of crap but John seemed to think I didn't know
what I was talking about. It sucks when you are outside working in 100
degree heat, pulling an engine, pulling a transaxle, putting in another
transaxle, and then find a brand new $40 bearing that is a POS.


&gt; If you feel the bearing is bad from the get-go, take it back
&gt; to where you got it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;It probably isn't the new bearing that's at fault. If you needed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; replace one bearing, then the rest of them are probably worn out too.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am not replacing the bearing because it is 'worn out'. I am replacing
it
&gt; &gt; because the cage that keeps the rollers evenly spaced is/was plastic and
it
&gt; &gt; ceased to exist. Very cheap design.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The play you feel is probably in the lower inner bearing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When I can move the stub axle up and down and the rollers move an eight
of
&gt; &gt; an inch inside the outer race, the bearing is CRAP.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend
&gt; &gt; &gt; that you take the whole RGB apart and replace all the bearings. It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; really kind of pointless to replace just one bearing in a RGB. Any
chips
&gt; &gt; &gt; that are in the oil from the other worn out bearings will quickly ruin
&gt; &gt; &gt; your new bearing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't have any chips because I don't have metal failure from the old
&gt; &gt; bearing. Even though the plastic cage was gone, the old bearing had NO
play.
&gt; &gt; I found the bad cage only because I had to swap the backing plates.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've used Bower brand bearings before and didn't find them to be any
&gt; &gt; &gt; different from any other brand. Different companies will have
different
&gt; &gt; &gt; part numbering systems. Some companies will just use the same system
as
&gt; &gt; &gt; one of the big guys like FAG or SKF. The difference in part numbers
&gt; &gt; &gt; probably doesn't mean anything. They both have 207 in them, so they're
&gt; &gt; &gt; probably the same size.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; When you take the Bower bearing back out, compare it to the used
bearing
&gt; &gt; &gt; you're putting back in. If it has the same ID, OD, and width, then you
&gt; &gt; &gt; can be sure you need to completely rebuild the RGB.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The problem is NOT in the ID, OD, or width. The problem is in the
clearance
&gt; &gt; between the rollers and the outer race.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Let me make this clear:
&gt; &gt; The outer race is very tight in the housing.
&gt; &gt; The inner race is very tight on the stub axle.
&gt; &gt; The rollers are permanently attached around the inner race.
&gt; &gt; When you put the inner race/roller assembly inside the outer race, you
CAN
&gt; &gt; move it back and forth almost an eight of an inch. This is with the
bearing
&gt; &gt; laying on a flat surface and you are moving the inner race back and
forth.
&gt; &gt; With the brake drum on, you can rock the drum a 1/4 of an inch at the
edge!
