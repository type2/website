Hey Aaron, I've got a 57 Heilite too! heheh actually, I have Aaron's 
Heilite in my yard which got me to thinking about the other posts 
with bus counts in them.

Right now I'm looking at a couple of infamous buses: The Zebra Bus 
(56 coachbuilt) and The Lunchwagen (57 rustbuilt). Then, on the other 
side of the house I have the 67 Westfalia Poptop (for sale $3500) and 
my daily driver 66 EZ Camper (not for sale!). Next week I'll have the 
56 DD Panel (donor bus for the Lunchwagen) and then the week after 
that I'll have the 66 T34 Ghia (not a bus, but an alternate daily 
driver).

Yeesh...I need a hobby...oh wait.

Scott
