Subject: Re: [VB] Brake Pedal problem.

First would be nice to know what year/month the bus was produced since the  
spacer was used up to OCT64.  So if your bus is a later one it did not  use 
that part.  
  Next would call up the mechanic and see if the part is  still there.  If 
not, maybe someone here has a spare, or would  try advertising a want add on 
thesamba_dot_com .
