&gt;George,
&gt;
&gt;    Hey. Great job on the ad. I think you gave it away, just my opinion.
&gt;I don't know what else this guy could want. With your discription and
&gt;the pics that's the bus. As far as the engine goes,....., hell for that
&gt;price he should be lucky he gets an engine!  .......... You did a good
&gt;job describing your bus.  Heck. It's not your fault they can't read.
&gt;

I agree that you have tried to sell a bus at a fair price. No argument.


However. If you have an engine going with this bus, it seems to me that it 
would be easy to determine if it was good or not. This seems like something 
you SHOULD disclose.
