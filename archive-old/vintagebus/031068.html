I personally wouldn't run the 12V starter at all.  I would think it 
would make some nasty noises, and probably chew up the flywheel/starter 
a good bit.  Buy yourself a new 6V starter and install it.  Then rebuild 
the other 6V starter and carry it as a spare.

-62 12V standard w/ 200mm 6V flywheel and 6V starter

&gt;Anyway, I have the 12v starter in
&gt; another bus that I'm not using, and was hoping to use it for a week or so
&gt; while I rebuild the 6v.  Is this reasonable or is it
&gt; quit-trying-to-cut-corners dumb?
