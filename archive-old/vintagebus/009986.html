For those of you who are going to attend the BBTB event, I found an
interesting article by chance in one of my old Popular Science mags.  As it
turns out, it's in the Septempber 1968 issue and the title of the article
is:

London Bridge comes to America.

It details the purchase by the McCulloch Oil Company and tells the whole
history (compelete with photos) about its transportation and installation to
Lake Havasu City, AZ.  An aerial view of the peninsula is provided as well.

On the next page is a Beetle that was modified by William J. Smith of Santa
Ana, California.  The engine is a 40 HP Mercury outboard engine and since
this engine is converted to steam, it puts out 250h.p.  What looks like a
burnout is actually the water vapor being expelled from the engine in the
photo.

I will be scanning in a ton of these old articles (there are some great old
Bus articles detailing it's usefulness) as well as a review of the &quot;1500
Sedan) - Notchback in otherwords.

Some of you that stepped forward in the past and offered to host the
&quot;Europe's Model A&quot; article about the beetle may want to email me privately
so I can send you these awesome articles.
