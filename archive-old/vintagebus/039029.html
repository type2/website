Subject: Installing plastic sheeting on doors
Message-ID: &lt;D3C18AEA0EA1D111B8DA00805F85E889011F9016_at_dsntexsrv3.diasham_dot_com&gt;

OK, I've finally sanded and poly-coated my homemade wooden door panels for
my single cab. So now I want to install them, but I want to put up some
plastic moisture barrier sheets on the doors just like on new cars to keep
the water away from them.  

I bought some 6 mil clear plastic sheeting from Home Depot, but what the
heck do I stick it on with?  I'm considering 3M Weatherstripping, but that
stuff is pretty permanent, isn't it?  Also considering rope-caulk, but I'm
not sure if it's sticky enough.   Suggestions??

Thanks!!
