Yes it does. A balmy 113 in the shade today, not a speck of  shade anywhere.
Raffle bus is shot in primer, needs blocked. Let's see, we have 10 weeks
until Jerome. The bus needs painted, reassembled, mechanicals done, engine
installed, I've got to do the camper kit, and apparently the majority of the
other members of the club have taken the same vow I did not to touch this
bus. It is a 62 sub-hatch Westy and it will be a nice one if it gets done.
We work on it every weekend at my house, and I buy the beer. We are hoping
to have it complete in time for Familienfest so the left coasters can get a
look at it. You want to work? Come and stay the weekend. Pool is cool, beer
is cold, and the weather is damn hot. When are you Havasu guys coming down?
Ellis, you just drive over in your F150 and sit in the driveway with your
a/c on.......

&gt; Now that I think about it- that description sounds
&gt; like my job at Boeing or a weekend working on the
&gt; raffle bus at Kyle's ...
