Subject: Re: [VB] At my wits end- Leaking axle seal

Heres the things i went thru when i had this trouble a while back. This is a total checklist, not
undermining your mechanical ability..

Replace seal race (WW stocks these sometimes) due to groove worn in from 40 years of the seal
rubbin.
Trying blue German seals as opposed to the black ones (Ronnie may still have some of these)
Also one technique to try is putting the seal race into the seal/cap and making sure the seal is
seating properly, then putting the whole assembly on there at one time so you know the seal is
already seating properly on the race. Might help, might not.
You didnt mention it, but i assume you replaced the small o-ring that goes on the backside of the
seal race on the shaft? I would make sure that area is nice as well for proper o ring sealing. You
may be leaking thru the center of the seal race spacer which the big seal has no control over- so
keep that in mind on your trouble checklist.
Did you install the oil sling washer that goes in the cap before installing the seal? Also did you
ensure the cap drain hole was clear which allows any escaping fluid to go out the backside of the
backing plate?
Also you should not be using the very large black oring that comes with all the kits if you have the
bus seal covers *without* the chamfer(like a bug cover has) That can cause leaks for obvious
reasons.

Extreeme problems/fixes when your really at your wits wits wits end:
Worn RGB bearings, letting the rgb axle flex too much up and down and seal then leaking. (you didnt
mention if the RGBs had been rebuilt also?)
Warped seal housing, (which forces a seal to be warped after install) Try a new housing.
A Bent lower RGB stub shaft causing uneven pressure on seal and would cause a wobbly wheel.
