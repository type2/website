&gt; off :-) whats nice about my SO-44 interior is the closet is placed behind 
&gt; the driver... that way i have a full-width bed in the back, its quite 
&gt; spacious. but i smack my head on the larger cabinet over the back.

heh.  I cant sleep under my headbanger closet.  waaaaaay to close...


I usually stuff a coat/pillow/clothes in the gap between the end of the
bed and the behind-driver closet, and put the pillow on top of that (else
it falls in the floor..)

You gain a good foot to the bed, and even more diagonally.

But it does take a good bit of getting used to to keep from losing your
pillow;)
