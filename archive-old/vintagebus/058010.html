i'd have to agree with harry on this one. leaking 
brake fluid on the opposite side from the direction it pulls to. and/or maybe a 
plugged brake hose/line, but i'd check for a leak first.

Subject: [VB] bad brakes





I had tie rods replaced at a local shop and haven't really driven my bus 
much since.  Then today I applied the brakes and my bus really pulled 
to the right.  

 

I don't really have time to look at it until next weekend when I'm planning 
a tune up and oil change - but does anyone have any ideas as to why my bus would 
pull to one side like that. I guess a brake adjustment is the first thing to try 
but I thought I'd ask.
