is corroless basically the same as POR-15, I used it as for my front floor pans, as it came highly reccomended from another VW owner who used it on his window frame rust.

You recommend using a sealant on the car, under the seal? 


&gt;seal up where the wiper pivots go through or you will still get water in the package tray.

I am, getting water in my package tray now, as the windshield is leaking, and I guess my wiper pivots must be leaking too, does a gasket go in here, or just some silicone-type sealant?
