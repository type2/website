:hey volks,
:
:some time ago i posted an inquiry about putting a gas guage in my '60 westy.
:after all the responses, i figgered the best thing to do would be to install
:a beetle speedo (i used a '67) with a guage built in and put in a new tank
:with a sender. my tank was in bad shape anyway. so, i've got everything
:installed but cannot get the gas guage to read properly. the level on the
:guage flucuates wildly and reads about 1/2 tank low when it is stabile. i've


Tony,
  When I was looking at various gauge possibilities, I noticed a square metal box on the back of some of them. It was attached to the lead for the sending unit (I think) and had a connector for that wire. I was told it was a 'vibrator' and that without it the gauge would fluctuate and never give a stable reading. Check around and see what you can find. HTH
