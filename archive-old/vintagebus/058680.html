Subject: Rear Deluxe Bumper


I don't suppose anyone going to Red Barn will be offering up a rear deluxe 
bumper in very straight condition?  Since my front is rounded I suppose I 
should ask for this same style although slash would be the correct for my 
bus which is a '63.  This is the last &quot;required&quot; major piece of hardware for 
my bus at which point I can begin acquiring seals and the like... love to 
get that roof rack being offered but it is outta my budget right now but 
still on my wish list... sigh.
