Subject: bbbrake adjustments

HI Bus Folk
I was wondering if I am doing something wrong or forgetting to do something.
My son's 66 split-window's brakes
are constantly needing adjusting. It seems like every few weeks( my
aggravation maybe tainting my memory!)
Everthing is fairly new. wheel cyl, pads, lines and M.C. They just need some
time or
ss there something I should be doing to &quot;secure &quot; adjusters?
Thanks
Tom
