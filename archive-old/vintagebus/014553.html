&lt;&lt; I've got full subflooring (&quot;belly pans&quot;) on my bus, and I was wondering 
will this cause any trouble with maintenance?  I was thinking about maybe 
shifter stuff, since it runs up in there.&gt;&gt;
Hi Andrew,
The shift rod passes through a tube in the 1955-67 buses.  So other than 
taking out the rear shift rod out about every ten or so years years or after 
200,000+ miles to check the plastic bushings and slather them with grease.

Unless the drums have really bad grooving or slanted more than .040&quot; (1mm) 
side to side you really should try driving them for a couple of weeks and see 
if they round themselfs out with carefull braking.  What we mean about 
carefull braking is not dragging the brakes all the way down long hills.  
Especially slaming them just after heating them up like this tends to warp 
them.

&lt;&lt;  I could of course way easier afford to get them turned, but I've heard 
that this may not be good for my braking ability, etc.  If it's done well, is 
there any real advantage in getting new hardware instead? &gt;&gt;
Turning VW brake drums should only be done when needed!  They are thinner 
than USA manufactures of automobiles and because of this can be used up way 
sooner if turned for no good reason.  Since good quality repro or OEM drums 
are hard or at least hit and miss to get it is a good idea to take care of 
what you have now.
