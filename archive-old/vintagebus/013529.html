BAM! sold. Thanks to all who inquired.

Jerome kicked AZ! A couple of months ago, in my grumpy
moments, I was sorta thinking of not going. By the
time that September rolls around each year we are
always there and have a total blast. Too tired to tell
all about the weekend-will leave that to others for
now.
