[...]
&gt;Immediately after passing the other vehicle, I get a panic attack that
&gt;my bus might break down at this exact moment requiring me to pull
&gt;over and having the car I just passed race by with the driver thinking
&gt;&quot;took everything he had to pass me, ha ha ha&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;This is one of those &quot;hidden, untalked about&quot; afflictions and I feel so alone.
&gt;
&gt;...Markus
&gt;
&gt;ps:  Tardis has never broken down yet, which is what makes this so
&gt;unbearable.

cmon, markus, life is way too short to worry about stuff like that. I
recommend that you get yourself a copy of Gene Autry's &quot;Tumbling
Tumbleweeds&quot; and play it over and over again while you drive... this is
nearly -ideal split window soundtrack music...

also maybe get a copy of &quot;The Water Margin,&quot; a famous Chinese novel, to
read at rest stops...

between the two of them, they ought to put your mind at ease. If they don't
cut it, think about buying a couple of early Louis Armstrong records... if
*those* don't cut it, your shoes may be too tight.   :  '  )
