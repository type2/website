Its back  again - I replaced the fuel pump and gas is still somehow filling 
up 
my  crankcase.  Does anybody know exactly what years are supposed to use a  
4.25&quot; fuel pump rod and which use a 4&quot;????  I cant believe I got two  faulty 
fuel 
pumps in a row.  And as far as the carb, I rebuilt it  again and I cant 
believe 
that the gas is running down the carb, past the  valves, past the rings and 
into the crankcase in such a hurry as the  dripping starts when i hook up the 
fuel to the fuel pump.  I THINK MY  BUS MAY BE EVIL




By your desription it has to be the pump. If you don't start the bus and  
just attach the fuel line and &quot;the dripping starts&quot; the pump has to be bad. The  
carb doesn't get fuel until the pump starts pumping. Measure your rod if it's  
the long one get a short one. OR cut yours down to the short length.
