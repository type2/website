Subject: Re: [VB] Friday~ bought another water pumper!

True story:
In about 1968 there was a 65 Ford sitting on a trailer in front of Ford
Motor Company Oklahoma City Zone Office.
The Ford had Lemons painted all over it.
In the two years I'd been going to OK City the car had been dropped there
each morning and removed about 10pm every night.
Things went askew and OK City was hit with a fairly bad Tornado.
As things worked out the Ford on the trailer with the lemons was there
the next morning and the Ford Zone Office was virtually flattened.
The Tornado hit about 10 PM and I'm not quite sure if the Ford on the
trailer was parked at that location during the Tornado or not.
I've got to give it to the Lemon Ford owner ........... I give him 10
points for persistence.
