113 101 371C is 62-64 1200
and is a variation superceeding 113 101 371.
These heads are the early type which have long studs
and round rocker-arm  bosses. the studs pass thru to
 the rocker box floor, close to the  combustion chamber
and subject  to vibration and breakage.

113 101 373  is the head for 65 1200 , and is the best  stock 40hp head.
square rocker-arm bosses, short rocker studs and an extra cooling fin,
along with combustion chamber enlarged around the spark plug  and intake valve.
these heads are slightly thicker than the  371C head because of the extra fin,
and will require longer pushrods and cylinder head studs.

hardly a perfect match.
Dave
