&gt;&gt;That's the biggest problem with good repros - unscrupulous people pawning them off as original.
&gt;&gt;
That's why you should never pay big $$$ for NOS parts unless they have a tag/box/sticker/bag/etc., even if it's only a remnant.  

I had a dream last night that I sold my 2 NOS &quot;frosted&quot; interior light lenses, the guys would not believe they were NOS because they had never seen frosted ones.
