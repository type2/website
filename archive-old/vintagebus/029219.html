&gt; hello to all,
&gt; My turn signals havee some issues and I was hoping that all y'all could help
&gt; me knock some sense into them. when i signal my turn, they are sometimes
&gt; stubborn and want to just flicker and then finally blink and then blink a
&gt; few times and then flicker again. it's very irrational behavior in my
&gt; opinion and there is no pattern in their actions.

Clean all of your connections..take fine sandpaper to them... should clear
things up...i had this problem before too...
