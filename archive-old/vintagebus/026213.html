Subject: [VB] splitty childs cot?
Message-ID: &lt;382E547A.882BBEFC_at_vbe_dot_com&gt;

hey all
I picked up a perfect, non ripped-non bent childs cot today with brackets.
These aren't teh same brackets that I've seen on the 69 I had...and the poles
in teh cot aren't the same either...they are much simpler..and are made out of
galvanized steel i believe...
the cot is that mustard puke color...
I belive it is a splittie cot.

1. what are these worth?
2. how hard are they to find?
3. did I leave the iron on?
4. do they mount the same as they do on the baywindow buses?
5. how much weight can they support?
6. would anyone like to trade anything for it?

bye
Isaiah
