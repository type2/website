Ran into something that has never ever occured to me before.
Last night I pulled my sons AE case DP motor out of his '71 Bus.  Trans
seal replacement was needed and an outer CV boot too.
While the motor is out I figure to shim up the crank endplay from .0065&quot;
to .003&quot; or so.
I remove the main seal and find only &quot;2&quot; shims....I hunt for a third but
none to be found.  I wiggle and scratch at the 2 in hand and I was dead
positive they were only 2.
This totally throws me a curve in the computations I had already worked
out for the clearancing.  
I re-do the math...install the shims, torque things back together..take
another endplay reading and ...zip...no clearance whatsoever????
Pull it apart..re-shim it with a thinner shim in place of an .015 that was
there....
put it back together...measure again and ....zip...STILL no endplay
clearance.  What the!!!!!
3rd time is a charm
My son removes the shims after this third tear down...and lo and
behold...two of them separate!  I couldn't believe it!  I'm thinkin some
yahoo put in only 2 shims, so I attempt to rectify that...only to find out
I'm a yahoo putting in 4 shims!
I'm probably the only one whoever has done that...unreal
One last thing...I've torqued a slew of gland nuts.  Always buy new and
use them after removing one that has been in place for unknow years of
use.
I bought a new 3/4&quot; breaker bar and 36mm impact grade socket....
Snapped that gland nut and the resulting &quot;bang&quot; was incredible!  Not a big
deal...removed the piece inside the threads that was left behind, got
another and installed it.  Oh....I shortened up my breaker bar...no
problems now.
later
