It was not meant to target you Kyle. It was just a general message to
everybody for &quot;bashing&quot; the New Microbus. We've been there many times
probably already. To me this is just another Volkswagen. I wouldn't buy a
minivan but a Microbus? that's another story. Honest, I would buy one of
these to haul my wife, two kids and a dog in including my clients on
occasion. They have difficulties getting into my lifted Explorer now.
lol

Don't even mention Aztekkkkkkk because it's uglier than anything ever built.

As you see then, this was not meant to hurt you Kyle so don't take it
personally. To all you guys and girls driving your busses all year round I
salute you but unfortunately in my neck of the woods with all the salt they
put on the roads, my bus would not survive more then two, three years. I
wouldn't like it.....


Later,

Andre
