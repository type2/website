&gt; I've observed them to settle initially.  This is more likely to be the

&gt; side to the other.  In any case, once they settle, they stay that way for
&gt; a very long time.  It would be interesting to know what the actual setting
&gt; used at the factory (with new torsion housing and spring) was.  Did VW add
&gt; in a few extra minutes of twist to account for the initial sag?

Actually, the Bentley says the L/R orientation is irrelevant.
