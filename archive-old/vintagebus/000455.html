Hi Chris,
Here below is some of what Larry Pmailed us and our responses.

Pmailed to us:
&lt;&lt; Ah, do you still need to butcher the pushrod even if you have a spacer?
 My impression from your article was that it was either/or.&gt;&gt;
Hi Larry,
Yes you do.  Reread the first 3/4 of the last paragraph.
 
&lt;&lt;I've actually got brake-cylinder hones (including the small-bore ones for 
MC) from doing the wheel cylinders.   Given my experience with those, 
however, I expect to find rust in the MC.  Most of the wheel cylinders were 
too deeply pitted to save, the rest took a good bit of honing.  I think 
you're basically right, but without a rebuild kit anyway, I suspect I could 
make it worse and render the bus undrivable until I get the replacement MC.&gt;&gt;
If the area of the bore that the piston seals are with no or little pits they 
are most likely fine.  Having pitting in areas where the piston seals do not 
ride in is of little matter.  Plus if the old piston seals are not cracked or 
badly worn they will do fine.  
   By the way how much are the repro 1967 only MC going for now?   Thanks,  
Eric&amp;Barb

&lt;&lt;The Depot guys say Varga is changing hands now so brazil MCs are getting
back-ordered, and german is almost as much as one of Ronnie's '67s, so it's 
gonna take a while anyway unfortunately.&gt;&gt;

Hi Again Chris,
This last information is not good news.  Matter of fact we probably will 
visit our FLAPS in the next few days and see if any of the 1971on MC are 
still in stock so we can stock up on them.  We were getting these for about 
$40.00 and hopefully Varga or whoever is buying Varga will restart the late 
model bus MC assembly line soon.
