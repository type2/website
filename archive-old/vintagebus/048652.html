I agree that RMMW prices are high. I would like to say that my few
experiiences with them were good though. I always got my parts the very
next day without even paying for next day. So....if you know what your
gonna be charged and your cool with it, I think their fine. A lot of the
cheapo places seem to have a big problem with customer service and even
sometimes getting your merchandise to you (ala No Quarter). MO
