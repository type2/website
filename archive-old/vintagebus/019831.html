You're gonna have to do it the old fashioned way: lay under the bus
while you have a friend wiggle the steering wheel.  Watch where the play
comes from and how much.  Replace those components.

Possible culprits:

center pivot bushing
drag link
tie rods
king &amp; link pins
steering box

&gt; The steering wheel has some play in it. The bus likes to steer itself. I can 
&gt; compensate for it, but would really love a solid drive! I know this could be 
&gt; a multitude of things, but want to know your opinions / tips, before I order 
&gt; a rebuilt steering box!
