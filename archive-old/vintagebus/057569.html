Subject: horseshoe  clamps

Can someone please direct me to a source for the horseshoe shaped
roofrack clamps? They have a threaded part in the middle, and tighten
with a wingnut bolt thing. I am looking for 4 of them, either
reproduction or genuine used ones. These are for a heavy duty, ( maybe
called industrial? ) old VW full length rack. The 2 clamps I have will
hold it on, but not too safely. TIA
