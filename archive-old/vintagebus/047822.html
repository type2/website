&lt;&lt;  er- the dash was the bottom colour April 61 when my 61 was made.   The 
change was made in late 61/early 62 sometime.   Anyone with later 61s or 
early 62s 
 want to comment on their dash colour being the top or bottom colour? &gt;&gt;

Hi Clara,
Our 26FEB62 chassi # 908798 was painted sealing wax red over the outside and 
then the white on the upper.  Dash is painted white.  Eric&amp;Barb
