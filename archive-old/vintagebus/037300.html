&gt; Hi David,
&gt; One should rejet a carb not only for engine size, but for air cleaner type

&gt; used, type of engine compartment, and muffler.  Eric&amp;Barb
&gt;

Eric and Barb, hello.
I have heard that most new carbs are jetted rich for our 1600 application,
and that includes the 34, and 30/31. I know I rejetted my 30/31 I had in a
1641 leaner then it originally was. I now have a 1600 SP, bug exahaust,
stock air cleaner, with a new 30/31. Could you recommend jet sizes? Without
looking, I will guess from past experience that it has a 130 main in it.
Should I go with a 125?

Jason S. Thinking it does run rich, but have been driving this way for a
while now.
