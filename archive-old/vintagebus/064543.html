Subject: Re: [VB] Ride Height.

The splitty bars I've seen (only 4) have no markings to indicate L or
Right, just some 'divot' markings, and I have one bar with an 'A' on it.
What's right and left in german?
Perhaps SPLIT bars are JUST SO stout (wouldn't 68-up bay bars be the
same?), it just doesn't make a difference.

Should the floor/bed be perfectly level with a properly adjusted
suspension? Are all we have is the angles of the suspension pieces to
check, or is there an attitude of the bus to check these against?

My rear tires have the same positive camper described by Thom, bus seems
level at floor at rest with engine and rear seat/battery. Slight postive
camber at rest tho.

&gt; CAUTION:
&gt; Torsion bars are prestressed in their working direction.  If both rear
&gt; torsion bars have been removed you must be careful not to interchange them
&gt; from one side of the vehicle to the other.  The left bar has an L on its
&gt; outer face; the right bar has an R.  [italic] If the bars are installed on
&gt; the wrong side, they will break when placed in service.[end italic]
