the solution is simple, buy both and use the elephant ears on the daily and
keep the round ones in nice velvet bags and get them out on special
occasions! thats my plan

jb/mobile, al
&gt; I like the round ones because they look way cool.  But, i wonder how well
&gt; you can see to the rear with em. I have a 61 and i plan to drive it a
&gt; lot.  It has the small rear window so the mirrors may well be an important
&gt; tool.
&gt;
&gt; The elephant ears look like they might be better suited for seeing out of,
&gt; but they arent as cool looking... i think they started offering the
&gt; elepahnt ears 61 or earlier, so either one is correct...
