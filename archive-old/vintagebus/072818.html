Subject: Re: [T2] 71 passenger bus in Calaveras County, CA

OK it's a bay, but it's an early bay and it's not often that one comes
along with a completely unmolested engine compartment.  It even has a
psuedosplitty paint job!  Someone buy this thing before a teenybopper gets
it!

&gt; I eyed the body pretty well...  Nothin' horrid that I could see.  She

&gt;
&gt; And OBO is, up here.  ;-)  Oh, the dude said he had 5 other cars and 2.5
&gt; drivers, just sold a bug also.
