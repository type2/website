&lt;&lt; Anyone have a lead on a sunroof clip? let me know, I've got cash and will
 pay a finder's fee too!

Todd,
   If you are really wanting to put a sunroof in your bus, why not get one
from Street Beat. So everyone will know that it is not original. When you
change stuff like this, you are changing history. Say down the road, way down
the road, someone is going to put back what you did, and they are going think
they had a sunroof standard or kombi when in fact they have a hardtop with a
hole in its head! Its the same as counterfiting money, or even worse.
