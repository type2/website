 Hi list,I'm new to this list.  Name is Brian and I just bought a 67kombi 
last 
 week. Already own a 73Westy and Bradley GT1,this is my first splitty.   
 Anyway when I turn the parking lights on only the city lights by the 
 headlights come on,is this correct???  Front Turn signal lights only light 
 when signals are turned on,is this all they were for ???  Thanks for any 
help 
 !!!!!   Brian

Hey Brian, welcome to the Cult.  ;)

Ya- the fried eggs on the front are just the blinkers. (turn sigs and e 
flashers)

when the headlight switch is pulled out halfway, the little bulbs in the 
sides of the headlights should come on.

when the headlight switch is pulled out all the way, the little front parking 
lights in the headlights should go off, and the headlights should go on.
