Subject: Bus Sheet Metal

I think that rear corners would be great!  Rear corners that go from the 
roof down to the bottom of the bus.  The whole shebang just like the NOS 
ones are.  Although I've only seen them for small hatch buses, I dunno 
how they do the later ones?

How about lower bulkheads?  I see lotsa these rusted out.  That and the 
little square in the front wheel well behind (towards the back of the 
bus) the tire that goes into the rocker/bulkhead.  I don't know which 
pieces go where in there, or how many parts meet at that area.  I 
haven't dug that deep yet.

And hell, if you're going all out, why not do *steel* ribbed bumpers? 
Thick ones.  I'm sure some of those places can stamp those out with ease.

Wheel arches for the buses with cut wheel wells.

Cargo doors would be great.  The whole thing if possible.  I'm sure this 
would save a lot of people headaches.

If you do rear corners/noses, stamp them blank (no turn signal holes) so 
they can fit both early and late buses.

The list goes on...
