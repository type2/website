&gt; just curious, Why?

The steering geometry of a bus has a designed-in &quot;caster&quot; that returns the
steering wheel ot the straight-ahead position when travelling forward.
The same geometry will tend to make the wheels go to full lock when
travelling backwards.  IF the tow bar is strong enough the wheels will
slide, but few tow bars are that strong!
