I checked at the Tacoma COSTCO yesterday, and the info. is as follows:

                       38010
             Steel Frame Canopy
    10' X 20' with removable sides
                      2 boxes
                      $149.99

This is the same setup they sold last Fall, with 3&quot; powder coated steel
tubing, post bases to prevent sinking into ground, no tools needed to setup,
etc.

Saturday evening they only had 2 left, so they're selling fast.

Also, I went to SAM'S CLUB this afternoon, and they are selling a similar
size shelter for the same price as COSTCO.  It's not as nice, however.  The
tubing is 2&quot; zinc-plated steel, no anti-sink feet, and a lighter grade of
fabric.  It does have removable sides.

I hope this helps.....
