Subject: Re: [VB] switch to synthetic?

First, let me say this.  There is a LOT of incorrect MYTH about synthetic
oil.  Let's set it straight.  My job for the last 7 years mainly dealt with
engine oil.  These are the facts.

You can switch back and forth from dino to synthetic oil all you want, it
wont cause a problem.  Mechanics started a bunch of rumors back in the 70's
and 80's.  Things like &quot;once you run synthetic oil, you can't switch back&quot;
and things like that.  These rumors are bullocks.  If you are low on oil,
you can even top it off with synthetic or dino oil if you want.  Amazing,
huh?  Just make sure it's the same brand and weight of oil. I'm not sure why
they have to be the same brand, if all brands are the same rating anyway,
but but all of the oil reps agree, stick with the same brand if you are
topping off.  If you add synthetic or dino, won't matter.

You CAN mix synthetic and dino oil if you want.  It will not do any sort of
chemical reaction.  Look at the oil avaliable.  How do you think they make
synthetic blend oils?

Don't bother buying the synthetic blend oils avaliable at stores.  The
synthetic blend oils you buy at the store are only 16% synthetic.  What's
the point of that?  Either go with full synthetic, or sick with dino.  The
price increase isn't worth it.

Synthetic oil does not eat away the seals in your engine or anything like
that.  The reason synthetic CAN leak more, is the molocules are all uniform,
and a lot SMALLER than dino oil molocules.  Where you once had a really
minor leak with dino oil, might leak a little more with synthetic, but if it
bothers you that much, switch back to dino, and the leak will go back to how
it was.  The leak increase will not be very noticeable anyway.

Berg writes that synthetic oil does not transfer heat very well, and
although oil temps may go down, that just means that the oil is not taking
the heat away from the heads, so the result is the heads overheat.  THIS IS
NOT TRUE.  Believe it or not, Berg was wrong.  Time after time, individuals
with VW's on all different forums, who are running both oil temp gauges, and
cylinder head temp gauges have found (myself included) that running a
synthetic oil can drop oil temperatures as much as 15 to 20 degrees, while
engine head temps do not change.  That is how much better synthetic
lubricates.  Less friction.  A whole lot less.  Concerning the heat transfer
thing, does anyone know that was the purpose of synthetic?  Better heat
transfer is the whole idea behind it!  My opinion on the reason for Berg to
write what he did, is I think he only ran an oil temp gauge, and did not
monitor the head temp, and only made the conclusion that since the heat
wasn't in the oil, it must still be in the heads.  He never thought that the
better lubricating qualities of the oil meant that the heat was never
created in the first place.  That part is my opinion.  I wasn't there when
he did the testing, and GBE doesn't release his testing data so we can know
what sort of 'test' was done.  :-)

If you run synthetic oil, you still change the oil as often as you would
with dino oil.  Engine oil is started out with a base stock, then the
additives are added to it.  The only difference between synthetic oil and
dino oil is the base stock that the additives are added to.  Believe it or
not, the oil itself does not break down, its actually the additives that
fail over time.  (That's why they can recycle oil)  So as you see, if  both
dino and synthetic have the same additives, and it's the additives that
fail, you change them both at the same time.  Synthetic can not go longer.
Notice how many years it's been since Mobil1 has said you could go 25K miles
on an oil change?  It didn't take many engine warranties for them to yank
that ad campange.

Should you run synthetic oil?  That's up to you.  Oil temps will go down,
the engine will last longer, but at about twice the price, if you aren't
running an oil filter, it's probably not anything to sweat.  If you're
running a filter, I would recommend it.  Unless you leak enough oil to add a
quart a week, then obviosly, fuggehtaboutit.  :-)

Here's an extra tid bit of info concerning the engine oil.  Head temp and
oil temp have almost nothing in common.  Head temp is load dependant, and
oil temp is rpm dependant.  More load, more head temp.  More rpm's, more oil
temp.  Don't believe me?  Run both, a cylinder head temp gauge and an oil
upressure gauge for a few years, and you'll see for yourself.  I've talked
to many others that have found the exact same thing.  In stock
configuration, just an oil temp gauge is 'okay', but if you have any changes
to the system, in particular, a freeway flier trans, a cylinder head temp
gauge would be wise money invested.  Get why?  Lower rpms, runs the oil temp
lower, so you think that it's not making you overheat, but the same load is
on the engine to do 60mph as before, but with less airflow over the heads
(since the cooling fan has slowed down), means they are now running hotter.
Bummer, huh?  If you're running a CHT gauge, remember, you don't want to
'cruise' with the temp over 400, and you don't want to 'peak' over 425.

Anyway, be carefull of the 'myth' concerning synthetic oil.  The above about
synthetics is the facts, I can assure you.  If someone tells you different,
either they are lying to you, or they just dont know, and are misinformed.

&gt; on the topic of switching to synthetic, I am contemplating switching my
&gt; engine oil over to synthetic, based on list discussions, talking with many
&gt; people, and some research. what my research, and discussions have not
shown
&gt; me is:
&gt;
&gt; any info on the oil blends(these are half synthetic/have dino juice)
&gt;
&gt; what the steps involved are for switching your engine from regular oil to
&gt; synthetic. If this info on switchig oil types is accurate, then that would
&gt; mean needing to pull the engine, to get at all the seals that are exposed
to
&gt; the oil, right?
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; Really any rubber seals. They get a set to the oil and a switch distrubes
&gt; this. It is like mixing chemicals. you can mix 2 with no proble but add a
&gt; 3rd and you get a reaction. Same with syn and petro oils. if you mix the
two
&gt; together your oil will turn to goo. They just don't mix and the rubber is
&gt; porous so it takes in both and the reaction is that the rubber goes south.
&gt; Gets soft and leaks. because seals get a set to an oil and if you change
&gt; that it is gonna leak.
