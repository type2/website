&gt; Strip about half an inch of the end of a piece of 14 or 16 gauge wire, 
&gt; preferably brown, and lay it on the shiny spot.  Put a pipe clamp around 
&gt; the tube and tighten it to hold the wire to the tube.

Hi Matt,
That will work, but later corrosion will build up there and cause grounding 
problems again.  For the N. American taillight holders the tube you mention 
is made of steel which is pressed/riveted to the bulb reflector and you can 
solder the copper wire to that steel tube easily, vastly reducing future 
grounding problems.

 I added a ground wire to my license plate light too, &gt; for complete 
&gt; thoroughness.
&gt; 
Interesting idea!  Our buses have a stock grounding wire there, but it only 
grounds them to the engine lid.
  We have been considering installing a second bulb in each taillight for 
more light and less chance of light failure wether signal, brake, or running 
light.  Also want to try the some of those bulb to LED conversion.
