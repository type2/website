Al --

If my memory of high school and college physics serves me right, the color
does matter. There's a term &quot;black body radiation,&quot; and black objects are
theoretically best at radiating heat. I've forgotten all the details. I also
think this is why the X-15 and the SR-71 Blackbird were painted black -- to
shed heat. Of course, paint is not theoretical; it has a thickness and
insulating properties that may outweigh the theoretical advantage in a
real-world application like painting an air-cooled engine. Best to just
STAIN/DYE your engine black somehow...

&gt; I just don't see how a color of paint would increase or decrease an
&gt; objects affinity for heat...(snip)
