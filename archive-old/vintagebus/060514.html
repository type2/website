Subject: RE: [VB] heating a bus 

Hi Cecil,
Best to make sure your stock heating system is fully tuned up and all pieces 
in place.  If it does fairly well but needs some help you can install 
styrofoam paneling from your local hardware store to insulate.  If that does 
not do the trick you will need to get a gas burning heater of Eberspacher or 
perhaps South Wind make.  To use the oil to heat is a waste of time due to 
the oil will be too cool to really heat your interior to any great effect 
when needed and the more hosing the more chance of oil pressure failure.
