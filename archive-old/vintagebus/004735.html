 Hi,

l am soon to take apart the front end on my 64. I think it has a newer front
end because it has an anti-sway bar attached. I have taken apart front ends
as far as removing and rebuilding the king pin assemblies but never taken
out the torsion bars. What holds them in and are there any dangers in
removing them? I want to inspect all of them because the front seems to be
sitting a little lower than it should.

Chris
