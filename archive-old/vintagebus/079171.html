Subject: Auto Linea/Hubner Brazilian heads

Hey Volks

I have the opportunity to buy a pair of brand new DP heads
at a very good price. They are Brazilian aftermarket heads
made by Auto Linea/Hubner.

Does anyone have any experience with these? Are they any
good? Are they worth buying cheaply or otherwise?

The heads are new in the box, with no valves. Machining and
casting look OK, with no casting flashing clogging up the
fins. There are no VW logos or part numbers anywhere on the
heads, although they look like standard DP heads. I believe
Hubner is an OEM of VW heads and other engine parts?
