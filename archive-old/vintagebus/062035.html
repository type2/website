&gt;These are the small 2&quot; round ones.  I've misplaced my extras that I had.
&gt;  More than happy to pay for them and shipping.  Not sure what they went
&gt;for at the event.  I think it was a buck or two each.


You mean the &quot;Limited edition OCTO sticker&quot; that went with about EVERY door

You can get them by the handfuls if you wait about 4-5 weeks for the 
October meet.
