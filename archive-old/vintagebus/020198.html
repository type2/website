In-Reply-To: &lt;008101c0e325$e93602e0$104ee53f_at_williamt&gt; from Kyle at &quot;May 22, 2001  6:15:52 pm&quot;

One of the worst driving experiences I ever had was getting stuck behind a
*rendering* truck on a 100+ day in stop and go traffic.  I was &quot;this&quot; close
to driving the *porcelain* bus!  I picked up a load of hippies to try and
kill the smell.

As to driving with the safaris; generally the cops here have better things to
do than hassle bus folk, but if you're doing other stupid stuff, and attracting
attention to yourself in some other way, it's just icing on the cake for them.
I don't get hassled by the man like when I was a punk kid - &quot;why not?&quot; you ask?  
Because I learned (the hard way) not to attract attention to myself, ie loud exhaust, 
loud stereo, flashy paint (I have the rice boys to thank for upping the ante there, 
what with all the stickers and outrageous graphics!), super-low ride, and 
playing &quot;pole position&quot; in traffic.  

There was a time when if a month went by and I didn't get a ticket, Maurice Hannigan
(former CHP commissioner) would personally send a get-well card.  I'm sure there's a bridge 
or library out there that was dedicated in my honor, for my generous contributions 
to the general fund.

Run silent, run deep, and The Man won't give you a second look.
