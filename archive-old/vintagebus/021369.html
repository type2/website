 &lt;&lt; Where will I use this?  When I took the rear axle tube off it seems that I
 should be able to replace the gaskets with out too much problem. Yes, I was
 able to finally get all the bearings off of one side.  Bently says that now
 there is an O-ring, which I have,  but on my bus there wasn't an O-ring.
 Should this just pop in?  I guess that VW went to the O-ring to deal with
 problems like mine.&gt;&gt;
Hi John,
You need the large C-clip compressor to take out the upper axle out of the 
tranny.  Then you can remove the crown gear for inspection for too much wear 
and/or cracks.  With the crown gear out you can take a look at the spyder 
gears in the differential.  Then inspect the fulcrum platesfor wear/damage, 
and the same to the shovel handles of the upper axles.  Then check each of 
these crown gears, fulcrum plates, and upper axle assemblies for too much 
wear with a feeler gauge to make sure of .008&quot; or less play.  Flatten all the 
dimples in the axle tube flange where DPO have overtorqued.  When 
reassembling use paper gaskets between the tranny and axle tubes.  You can 
make these gasket/shims with normal writing paper like 20Lbs. bond paper.  
You will have to most likely install about three layers of this paper gaskets 
to get the axle tubes to move up and down without in/out slop or binding.  
Once you have figured out how many gaskets/shims are needed install the upper 
axle parts, finger paint the gasket/shims with high temp silicon, and 
reassemble the upper axle tube to the tranny.  The huge O-rings for this axle 
tube to tranny area are NLA. 
 
&lt;&gt;
Best to do so and check all of the above to CYA.
 
 &lt;&lt;Also,  I have a new shifter rod coupling, mine was very difficult to get 
off and I was worried that I may have damaged it so I just figured I would 
replace it.  The replacement coupling looks very different from my original.  
Mine is a piece of very heavy ru bber between two heavy pieces of  steel?  
The replacement one looks quite a bit smaller and appears to be an all metal 
case enclosing .... ?&gt;&gt;
That is the not so good noisier replacements.  Ronnie has the good ones from 
what we hear.  Whichever you use make sure to safety wire the bolts so as to 
tighten not loosen them!
 
 &lt;&lt;Well, thanks again guys,  now I'm off to have my bearing checked to see if
 the are reusable - or should I just toss em and replace em? &gt;&gt;
Best to put new ones in!  That way you will not have to take things apart 
like this for a very long long time.  If you do use some of the old bearings 
put them only on one side together if there is enough of them to do one side. 
 To make fairly sure used bearing are good you have to sit down and inspect 
by eye both the inner and outer races of the bearing while turning them abit 
too see all the areas even under the ball bearings and inspect the balls also 
for any visible pits.  Any pits means a bad or very soon to be bad bearing.  
We inspect and put the good ones in sealed can with tranny oil over them to 
be carried on long trips for spares when $ is tight.  Eric&amp;Barb
PS Make sure to drill and tap (With a tap that is more of a bottoming tap.) 
your RGB to spring plate holes deeper to about 33 or 34mm deep while you have 
everything apart so you can use new bolts about 40mm long!  EEE&amp;B
