Subject: [VB] need split list digest backisses - Friday
Message-ID: &lt;0.cc2f83c0.2541e654_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I am trying to get caught up on my split list reading, and yes I WAS more 
than a year behind, but I am slowly making progress.  What a hoot.  Want to 
have some real fun?  Find a high-stress full overtime job and do it until you 
have saved enough to live off of and finish your project.  Let the digests 
pile up on the hard drive.  Then quit, move into the shop with your bus 
project, eat rice and beans, and do NOTHING but sandblast, weld, grind, 
fabricate, order parts from Ron and rONNIE (shouldn't they go in together 
(R&amp;R for R&amp;Ring)), paint, etc.. and of course read those digest back issues.  
ALL DAY LONG.... NO OTHER LIFE...  OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE.   I love splitties. 
BTW don't try this with children, pets, real estate, a job, any outside 
interested, or especially a domestic partner.  36 years old and this IS my 
dream.  And what does R&amp;R mean?

Any chance anyone out there archives the digests, like me?  If there is, I 
need the following 1999 vintage bus digests: 

61, 127, 128, 129, 220, 231

A big thanks if you can zip them and send them to me.

Yeah yeah, I will get pictures up, just let me finish fabricating this 
outrigger, and putting in that cab floor, and that dogleg, and baby butt, and 
rocker panel, and ...................
