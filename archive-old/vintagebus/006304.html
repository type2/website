A friend of mine had a bus in the late 60s , It was a double door. It was a
red bus , a 59 or 60 he thinks. Some friends of his painted &quot;greasy cove
daycamp / greasy cove, Al &quot; on the sides of it , as a joke. They did it very
well so it looked like a church bus. If anyone has any information on this
bus , please let me know.
