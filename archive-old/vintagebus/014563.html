Has any one ever heard of the lower &quot;mountain gears&quot; that were optional in 
the splits for the reduction boxes? They would be really cool for an offroad 
bus...                                                                        
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
             Blane '66 Bus, '60 Truck, '71 (well it is a Westy, though)....

they are very rare.   there was a bus at Bad Camberg with lotsa M codes 
including mountain gearing, and also limited slip differential  (m220).  
double door slider sunroof deluxe in original SK -orangey yellow.   was an 
airport bus for loading/unloading luggage for the airpplanes, so low gears 
for slick airport areas was the theory I guess.   see pics on my dad's 
webage.  

Nyway,   I have had good fun doing back road/offroad camping in  a split with 
whatever gears I had.      You can get a 4.37 r&amp;p, as everyone else wants  
the higher gearing,   though for road driving you'll find it happier to stay 
around town if you are geared really low.
