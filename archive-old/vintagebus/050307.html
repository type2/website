&gt;CE's safaris are supposed to be the bomb, but they're also close to the
&gt;price of the originals,
&gt;especially once you get them shipped over from England,

Maybe since Ronnie is already bringing all that repro metal and custom
bay-split fiberglass over from there, he might be able to work a
shipping/distribution deal with them? I know people would buy them.
