&lt;&lt; Hey there--
 I'm putting roof panels in the cargo area my '59 panel and was wondering 
what 
 the dimensions for the 2 roof panels are? I've prob asked this before, but, 
 I'm gonna go for it finally! Any tips are very appreciated...
 Thanks again--
  &gt;&gt;
they are not really easy to describe- getting a physical template is best.  I 
copied old ones to make sthe ones in my westy, and it is tricky to get it 
just right- meaning I had to take them out and sand it down a bit.
