Subject: Meine eine-teile Turschlossel habt zwei Teile...
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10105191856400.6531-100000_at_birdbird.birdbirdbird_dot_com&gt;

My one piece door lock is in two pieces...  So I have some questions
and some parts wanted.  

Well, I finally got the drivers door lock all apart and revealed many 
tales of woe.  The plate on the lock around the bolt, that has the holes
for the screws that go into the edge of the door around the bolt, broke
off the rest of the lock.  The door lock is a 211.837.015C .  The outside
handle is also broken - the little cast &quot;bridge&quot; on the back of the base
that holds one end of the return spring broke off.  This is the flip-out
style handle (not a push button), 211 837 205D .  (The maker's mark, BuM,
describes the current condition of the handle perfectly).  If someone has
a base with a roached handle, I could make one good one out of that and
mine, as the handle on mine is OK.  I also need two of the long Phillips-
head countersunk screws that go through the edge of the door and into
the outside handle.  They are about M5x18 or M5x20, I *think* N 14 268 2 .

The remote-control bar and axle for the remote-control handle are fine.
There is a rubber sleeve about halfway along the bar - I assume that the
bar is supposed to slide inside it, and the sleeve is meant to be held
down by the tab stamped out of the inner door skin in the middle of the
door?

If somebody has just the door lock and a line on what to use for the 
rivet between it and the remote-control bar, I could use just the lock.
Or, if you have the whole assembly, that'd be great too.

I finally got the inside handle off the axle with some Liquid Wrench and
tapping it around.  But in getting to that point I did manage to break the
phenolic trim ring around the base of the handle.  Part 211 837 235, color
466 silver beige.  I don't need this as bad as I think I'll leave this and
the cone spring off until I re-do the interior panels.

Please pmail me if you have any of this stuff you'd like to sell.
Thanks!

Matt Roberds
