Subject: clutch cable adjustment??

--part1_76.1e329376.2a48dee6_boundary

Is there an easy way to do this cause I was under the bus and theres no way 
to get both hands under there and turn a wrench! Or is there.... Seems theres 
two nuts ones a 11 or so and the other is a 14 or so.... Clutch and pressure 
plate are new but the cable was adjusted for so many years its all the way at 
the end and I need to tighten it up...........I can tell theres more room 
under a bug then on a bus...
Increase the Peace
