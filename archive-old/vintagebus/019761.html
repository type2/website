&gt; I'm headed to the Busses at the Beach / VWs by the Seaside shows the weekend of 4/21-22 in Jacksonville Beach.  Anyone else going (it's a great venue)?  Be nice to

You already knew I was going ;-)  This trip will be the maiden voyage of the
'67 Westy I've had sitting in the garage for months.  It may quite literally be
its first trip on the road at the rate things are going!  Today was really
busy, I got up at 6am to do stuff including obtaining a job, and only got 
back at 4:00.  It then took me a while to do the rear brakes...but now those
are done, so the engine can go in tommorrow or Thursday.  Tranny full of oil
now too.

I found all the parts I was complaining about the other day at Herrell VW,
including the accelerator-cable sheath (I never noticed it until I saw I was
missing one).  One thing though: my clutch cable is too small for the wing nut!
Does this mean I have an older cable?  It threads properly on the fatter
Wolfsburg West replacement cable, so that's where I'm storing it for that
fateful day...looks like 10mm nuts and a washer until then.
