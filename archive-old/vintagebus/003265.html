Subject: logoed double cab side gates possably Binz
Date: Sat, 22 Jul 2000 23:29:41 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

If anyone is looking for a set of side gates for a double cab. I know of a
set that is shorter than what is on a &quot;normal&quot; 64, at least. I would think
that they are probably for a Binz. I have a couple of pictures of them if
anyone is interested. No they are not mine but I can hook you up with the
junk yard if someone is interested.

Also I am in need of a set of deluxe coat hooks for my 63 Samba, any one
have a some extras? I know of someone that has a set of barndoor deluxe coat
hooks (balled ends) for sale but I want the correct pointed ones
