Subject: Re: [VB] Cleaning seats etc 

Ya, my sweetie used up my tin of polishing stuff  to polish a canoe (dammit) 
and tossed the can, so I am not sure what is the best stuff to get.  Any 
suggestions?  Ya I want the fine stuff for polishing original paint and 
aluminium trim and that kind of thing.

&lt;&lt; Clara, I think what you need is &quot;polishing compound&quot;. 
 It's finer than the other stuff.
