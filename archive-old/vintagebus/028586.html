Subject: Another one back on road

Took my first legal test drive today, this bus has not seen the road for
5 yrs.
I have been so looking forward to this day, but I've already noticed
that
I don't believe in the old girl just yet, I need to relax and start
logging miles
with her.

Gotta take her to the smog police, and let them have a sniff before they

give me the real plates. (wish her luck)

Gary
