Subject: Re: [VB] My 67 project

Jason - Are you planning on building a custom camper interior in this 
bus?  Seems like the perfect match where you can enjoy your hobby and 
your career at the same time.  I put 3/4&quot; oak hardwood floors in my old 
71 westy, and it looked and performed great.  Have fun and good luck 
with the '67
