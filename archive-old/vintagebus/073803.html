&gt; Oh yeah, the other day when I was driving the truck around I &quot;felt&quot; a
&gt; car full of cholos pull up next to me in their lowrider impala.
&gt; BOOM&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;BOOM&gt;&gt;BOOM&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;BOOM&gt;BOOM&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I could feel their dead gazes
&gt; shooting through me. So I said what the &quot;f&quot; and slowly turned my head
&gt; towards them. I kept a stone face as I turned and didn't dare move a
&gt; muscle in it either. When I finally made eye contact with the driver,
&gt; his head started nodding up and down. He then cracked full smile of
&gt; pearly whites and mouthed the words &quot;I LIKE IT&quot;. 

All I can think of is &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Nuessbaum&quot; at the gas station where
Steve Martin is working in the movie &quot;The Jerk&quot;.  &quot;Hey essa...through in
a set of whitewalls...OK?&quot;   Baaa ha ha ha!
