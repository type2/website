Subject: [VB] New law...no buses in the yard (long rant)
Message-Id: &lt;v04011701b458b1f3dd09_at_[192.168.0.9]&gt;

Texas has a new law which allows counties to invoke a public nusense
(spelling?) law. The law states that the owner of a property cannot have
any unsitely items that can be seen from a public street or road. This
means trash, junk, abandoned autos, ect. From what I gather, it's kind of a
gray description of what exactly falls into this catagory. I figure someone
is appointed to decide what he or she feels is not acceptable. They've had
a law like this in the city of Austin when I lived there. I was glad when I
moved to the &quot;sticks&quot; where everyone has a junked auto on their property
somewhere. But now it's a state wide thing!

Since I rent my property at the moment, my landlord asked if I'd go ahead
and do something with the one bus I had in the back of my rent property.
Since it's not my land, I just did what he asked. Luckily the only one
there was the '57 Single Cab that's going to Ronnie at OldVolks. So I
loaded it on the trailer and took it down the road about 5 miles and put it
in my Mom's barn with the others. Thank goodness for understanding parents!

We've talked about this kind of restriction on the list before. I just
don't see how there can be a law like this that's so subjective. It seems
they really have to get more clear on the issue. Who's to say that
someone's pink flamingos, or vintage wagon wheel, or lawn jockey isn't a
public nusense. I've seen all of those is nice areas of the city before. I
live in a total &quot;white-trash-single-wide-goats-n-chickens-in-the-backyard&quot;
neighborhood. I moved here to save $$$ and to be able to have a bus in my
yard without a hassle. 8 out of 10 houses has an unregistered broke down
vehicle in it's yard. Now, with the new law, certian folks are putting the
wheels in action to get 'em out of here. Some of these &quot;houses&quot; out here
look like they're held together with a ruberband and elmers glue!  How are
they gonna justify forcing some of these cars out of here without making
some people move their whole homestead?

I guess it's time for me to take up a political cause.

Thanks for letting me vent.
