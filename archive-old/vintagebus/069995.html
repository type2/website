  68 or later tailgate ifit has holes in it for the tail lights. If they
have a lip around them it's factory, if it's clean holes they were added

I just picked up a '64 SInglecab which I'm beginning to restore. My rear 
gate, which might not be original has 2 factory installed holes which line
up 
with the taillights when the gate is down. Does anyone know what these were 
for?

Thanks
Jerry
