&lt;&lt; To time it right you will need to set the dist drive gear properly.Reason
 for this is that #3 is retarded on the dist lobes.I am 90% sure of this so I

Hi Ted,
Correct as far as we know.  So if one has a unknown distributor set it up at 
TDC #1 and then check where the timing is on #3 cylinder.  If it the same as 
#1 then is the non-retarded type.  If it is ahead or after TDC on #3 it is 
the retarded type.  If the timing at TDC on #3 is ahead of #1then the 
distributor, the drive on the base of the distributor or the drive gear 
inside the case are aligned incorrectly and must be fixed especially on the 
non-doghouse cooler upright engines.  eric&amp;Barb
