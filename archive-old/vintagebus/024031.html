Subject: Bodywork on you back is for the birds.

The subject say's it all.  After spending a few hours on my back trying
to get the cosmoline off the belly of my bus, i am stoping.  The belly
pan;s are not too hard.  It is the rest of the stuff down there.  The
only proper way to do it is to blast it off.  I am not in the possition
to dothat right now.  Black undercoat is going to have to do.  It looked
great on the crew cab.  It will work here.

BTW.  I am having a block party at my house tommorow.  Block sand party
that is.  All with patience and block sanders are invited.

Matthew
