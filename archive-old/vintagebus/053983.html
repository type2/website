Subject: Re: [VB] Who da man for tow bars?

&gt; Since Dr. Joe Nodzak passed away, who is the best
&gt; person to call about tow bars 
&gt; for buses?

Richard Kimbrough has made some.  I have Dan Kinsey's
in my shop right now.  I'll try to get a picture of it
up after I get home tonight.  I think Richard's
address is rustybus_at_excite_dot_com

It looks really strong.  I just weighed it in order to
ship it to Dan, and it's about 36 pounds.
