 After all this talk on stolen/wrecked buses I stopped by to see my
insurance agent today. Asked him how much for full coverage on the 63. Told
him I wanted min. $8000 if bus was totaled or stolen. He went out and looked
at the bus, took 2 pictures , looked at all my reciepts, looked in some of
his books and said OK . Handed me off to 1 of the ladies and told her to
write it up and say interior was done also.
 She brings up my policy and I'm paying $96 every 6 months now for min.
state required coverage. Full coverage with $240 deductable will cost $119
every 6 months, $46 a year more is all. Policy still has to be submitted and
takes about 2 weeks she said.  My agent said it will sail through with no
problems, hope so.
 Will post when I know in 2 weeks.
 Shows you some insurance companys will work with you.
 I have been with this same agent for the 30 years I have been in Havasu and
we have all our vehicles and  our house with them so this, and his
commission check might have made a difference also.
 Anyway it pays to check.

 See some of you in Carlsbad Calif. this weekend!
