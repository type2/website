Howdy all, haven't written to the list for a while...

Just reading all of this about the bumpers, chromed bumpers on a bus look 
soooo sweet man, lota money though. My 67 had really bad bumpers when I got 
it so I tore em off and kept watch for replacements. I was at the octo show 
last year and picked up a front for $40 - yes 40 bucks AND it was in perfect 
cond. all the rough pits were sanded out and the guy had it primered ready 
for paint. As for my new back bumper, my buddy was scrapping his 72 and up 
till then the rear bumpers were the exact same as the early buses my, got 
that one for $20 and it is in great shape too.
You have to just keep an eye out and the parts you need will finally make 
their way to you!


Cheers

Andy
