Subject: 23 Window Project - $2,500

I wanted to give the two groups a heads up on this one.

My next door neighbor is pulling the plug on this project due to an 
irrational step-dad.
If I remember right, this thing started life as a thrashed double door 
panel and when Bryan bought it, it had a roof welded in.

He has since done an enormous amount of work on it, cutting in rear 
windows, side windows, and essentially making it into something reasonable 
and able to continue life as a reasonable bus rather than a parts 
donor.  Since it was built on the base of a double door panel, it does have 
the belly pans.

The left doors and entire side were completely rusted out, so he cut it out 
and replaced it with a side from a bus with windows and all.

If I remember right, its at the stage where the metal work is done and 
needs to be prepped for paint.  That being the case, it still looks 
rough.  Rough, but no rust.

Here's his problem.
Step-Dad went ballistic last night and ordered everything of his out of the 
house and garage.  He can still live there, but all his tools, busses, etc 
have to go.

He got rid of the bug today.  His '60 El Camino was moved to a friends shop 
and he needs to sell this bus ASAP so that he can have a place to put his 
other 23 window which is just too pristine to put outside on the 
street.  The stepdad has actually stacked sheets of drywall against the 
bus, just to hassle Bryan.  That with the paint on the bus being about a 
month old and never having been outside.

I'll be uploading pics to my site tomorrow night in hopes of helping him 
sell it.  Sunday, he want's to put it on ebay

If you're handy with primer and preparation for paint, this could be a 
great deal.

He spent the evening out looking for an apartment and hopefully had some luck.

By now you've most likely have some questions about his age and all, still 
living at home and the quality of the work.  He just turned 22 and has been 
buying, fixing, selling busses since he was 15.  He started attending 
college auto body classes while in HS at the age of 16.  For the last four 
years, he has been a metal fabricator at a porsche restoration 
shop.  Finally, his old instructor at the college, contacted him to ask if 
he would teach a metal fabrication course for him in the spring.  Still 
blows me away to see the skill level in someone so young.

Oh yea,  The bus is located in the garage across the street here in sunny 
Lakewood, CA, just south of LA and next to Long Beach.  Find the Long Beach 
airport on a map and we're 1 mile north.
