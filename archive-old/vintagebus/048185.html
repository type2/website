Matt and list, 

Great work on the 9 prong web site.  I learned something new today.  I never 
knew that the turn signal warning light operated as a lamp failure warning 
device.  I just thought mine was broken!  You have a very thorough web site 
there and nice diagnostic procedures.  I had a few comments:

According to the diagrams, '72 up beetles and 70-71 busses seem to use a 2 
prong with ground flasher relay and the turn signal warning light is hooked 
right to 49a.  Does this mean it acts just like the other turn signal lamps 
and looses its failure notification function?

You may want to point out that by using an early baywindow emergency flasher 
switch (71 for sure), one can eliminate 4 relays in your solution.  Someone 
jump in here if I am wrong.  This switch functions:
OFF:  
15=+ (powers flashers through ignition only)
54=54f (brake light pass through)

ON:
30=+ (powers flasher directly from battery)
49a=VL=VR=54f (flashes front lamps and rear lamps through brake circuit)

On another relay subject:  I have been looking at the 62-65 USA wiring.  This 
has 2 relays and the flashers work right off the battery (no ignition only 
operation).  The brake light circuit is wired directly to the turn signal, 
and in emergency mode the rear lights operate off a simple emergency switch 
in.  My question is:  Why did VW add a second relay (SPDT) to operate the 
front lamps in emergency mode?  My hunch is that the main flasher realy 
either had too low a capacity (like 2x21W) or had the failure function of the 
turn signal warning light &quot;tuned&quot; to operate only with two lamps. 

Again, nice web site, Tom Good (still) in Vermont
