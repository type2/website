Subject: RE: [VB] speedo vs. tire size

I kind of figured that. I have been driving without a speedo for a year and
keep to the speed limit or up with traffic just fine. I spent two weeks
recently driving from Kent WA toe Everett WA up 405 every day and night
without impeding traffic too much, except for the obvious speeders. So I guess
the odometer won't do me too much good either over the long run. Oh well, I
can pretty much judge my speed now by RPM so I can see where that puts me on
the new (old) speedo.

Thanks

Am I going to have a disparity in my speed reading by using a 62 speedo
in a 67 ?

You have to check the number of revs per mile on each speedometer.
That should give you a good idea but we already know that 62s didn't run
PR195-14 so you can count on it being wrong no matter what the revs per
mile number is.
I gave up on VW speedometers a long time ago and watch my tach as I click
off mile markers holding a constant speed. I simply run close to the
appropriate rpms for a certain speed and accept what comes.
Since everybody else speeds, I just stay behind them and haven't had a
speeding ticket since 1987 and then it was on a BMW bike.
