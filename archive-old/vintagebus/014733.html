Well, you get what you pay for.  Everyone seems to be obsessed with
*cheep* when it comes to buses.  I had a kid from Florida *beg* me
to sell him my panel *as* *is* - with no rust repair.

My first bus, a 67 hardtop westy - and the only running bus I've ever 
bought - was $800 and needed an alternator.  My '56 was $400, and 
it needed a battery and some love, but I got it running.  The '60
was free, and it started once I put a new fuel pump and battery in it.

So these buses were cheap, but were they?  The '60 was free, but it
needed all new brakes, and the engine was highly questionable.  The
electrics have issues.  Has, I mean *had* some rust.  I'm probably into
the car for $3000 so far!   And I still don't know what I'm going to
do with it...
