&lt;&lt; It's not as simple as &quot;color codes,&quot; which is (no offense) usually
 the problem faced by people who are inexperienced with paint.
 
 The &quot;color code&quot; on your mtag is the internal code VW used to
 represent that color.  You can't waltz into a paint store
 and say &quot;Hey Joe, mix me up a gallon of L31, would ya?&quot;   With
 a new car you *can* - but not with your 40 year-old VW.  And believe
 me, a time will come when you won't be able to get paint
 mixed by code for your '99 Saturn.  Accept it, it's a fact of
 life and obsolescence.
 
  &gt;&gt;

actually, that's exactly what I did when I got the paint for my 65 westy.   
walked in and said I needed L whatever velvet green and Lwhatever bluewhite, 
and the PPG people looked up in their records and had a book which listed 
their recipe for these colours.  However, they mixed the bluewhite a bit too 
green, so I went back, they were very nice about remixing it (tipping more 
white in the unused bit) and were apologetic about not getting it right, 
cause they knew all about wanting the colour right.  nice people.   Anyhow, I 
have seen one or two blue whites ppg paint that should have had a bit more 
white tipped in.

the velvet green- it still boggles the mind, it came out so close to the 
original, and I have some M code tags I used as paint chips,but each is a 
slightly different shade.  One matches my bus exactly.one is darker.  I think 
there was variation in the paint batches VW used.

anyhow, I have some pictures of SWR/BG buses, like my 61. My 61 is very faded 
though.  SWR in particular is a very difficult colour.   It is not pink, nor 
salmon, nor orange.   It does fade into a colour similar to those.    Find 
some original paint inside the bus- I polished my dash and it came out this 
beautiful deep dark red, sort of like... sealing wax.  Nice.  If the bus to 
be repainted had a white dash (god forbid someone repainted over the dash- I 
hate that, which is probably why I painted my westy) then there's you beige 
grey.    Or use a paint are behind he seat, or inside the engine compartment. 
  polishing getts the oxidised paint away, then you can an idea of what the 
original colour is.  Dont rush to paint it- the look really depends on prep 
time.
