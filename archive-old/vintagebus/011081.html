&lt;&lt; Yeah, that bus does rock!  I'm a sucker for logo'd buses and made sure to
 get some good pictures of this one!  And the Speedwell bus...but I can't
 believe those logos were done recently.  Greg, you gotta get him to come up
 to SJ sometime! &gt;&gt;

Why can't you believe it? The bus has speedwell words and the kilowatt guy 
from the old electric company advertisments, not to mention a web site 
address.
