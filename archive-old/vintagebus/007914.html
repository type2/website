Looks like due to some problems with my tow vehicle and work schedule I have
to postpone my trip for another week. Good think the owner of the bus is
willing to wait.

It's becoming even bigger mystery now. Owner says Bus has 13 windows and
then later that it's a Kombi. I think we already agreed that there were no
Sealing Wax Red over Beige/White kombis built in 1965 //\\ pardon, no two
tone Kombis anyway. There is no middle seat. This might be just a Standard
then or better yet, a Micro which would be cool.

One thing though. I'm gonna need a passenger side windshield glass for it.
It's cracked. It doesn't matter what logos it has as long as it's clear. If
anyone on my way has it I would like to pick it up while on my way to or
from OKC if at all possible. Thanks,

Andre,

(leaving Chicago Sat. morning. Overnight in OKC and heading home Sun.
afternoon)

&gt; &gt;Going to OKC from Chicago this weekend.  [...]  Anybody on the way want
to
&gt; &gt;wave or say hello? drop me a line!
