 &lt;&lt; thought i'd post a quick note... most folks have let the &quot;12v -  started
in
  66&quot;  line pass w/o comment. the 65 s/c i have (born week of may 5, 65 (same
  as me :)!  )  is a factory 12v, mcode, sticker on the dash and all.
  which makes it cooler, but makes me dread the day the wipers cease to work!
&gt;&gt;
 
 Stephen started a great thread here. Some of the discussion has really been
food for thought. IMHO your vehicle was custom ordered from the factory with a
twelve volt OPTION. This was available as an option for transporters prior to
the 1966 model when it became standard. I am not sure but I believe that a
number of pre-66 vehicles that were fitted as emergency vehicles were probably
ordered with this option.  Clara seems to be good at this stuff, Do you agree?
&gt;&gt;

12V system was available starting in 63 as an option.      N Am Spec buses had
is stanadrd for the 67 model year.   When I was in England a couple years ago
I learned that they  had some 6V VWs into the 70s, and there was the 12V 67
bug, which had a 1500 motor and disc brakes, and the 6V version, which had a
40-hp and drum brakes, and still had the sloped front fenders/headlights.    

Anyway, that aside, I think I remember the stock 12V 65 guy before, and that
it was a (rare) factory option.

so.....  rather than 12v started in 66, it should have said 

12V system- standard in 67 model year.
