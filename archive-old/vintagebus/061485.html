Subject: Westy interior light lenses

I work at a plastics company and am repoping these lenses, you can see them 
here:

I would like to make the earlier clamshell style too, but I need an original to 
see if it is worth it and to make a mold from. If anyone is interested, the 
donor gets the original back along with the first set of new ones. p-mail me if 
your interested.

&gt; #2) Interior lights. I've got two interior light fixtures that came with
&gt; the Westy. 
&gt; These lights are about 6&quot; long and hold two tube type bulbs but have no
&gt; covers. Are they worth reinstalling or should I find alternate lights?
&gt; Guess the real question is; where do I get the covers &amp; how much?
