&lt;&lt; does anyone on the list cut keys from code for the splits????
  &gt;&gt;
When I lived in north carolina and had the good fortune to drag all my buses 
out of fields and woods for less than I can buy a middle seat in oregon, they 
never came with keys. Assuming all your locks match you should be able to 
just take off your cargo door handle and take it to just abuot any 
key/locksmith place thats been around for awile and have a key made. this 
usually cost me between $8 and $14 depending on where I went. I only came 
across one place that said they couldn't do it, and I suspect he meant his 
a$$ was stuck to the chair he was sitting in as he diddnt seem to be doing 
much of anything. 
         Alabama could be different though, A friend of mines honda broke 
down in a small alabama town, and we couldnt even find a mechanic with metric 
tools. two days later after we found one to fix the car, he did a crapy job, 
and it diddnt even make the state line. Later he saw the light and bought air 
cooled.
