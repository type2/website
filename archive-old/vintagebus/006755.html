YES, every time you fill up at a gas station you are putting some sort of
additive in your tank, every brand has an additive of there own,

Has anyone dabbled in the gas additives?  I'm always up late at night
getting sucked into these fancy additive infommercials.  You've seen the
hype.  Protect the life of your engine, increase gas mileage, impress the
women, blah blah blah...  What about oil treatments?  So far i've always
kept my engines on the clean and sober side.  Do they deserve to let loose
and guzzle a few libations every now and then too?
