&gt; My '64 Sundial has a good 3&quot; of play in the steering, which makes driving an
&gt; adventure, any tips on what to look at first?
&gt;
Take a look at your drag link. It comes from the steering box and goes
to the center link pin( that thing in the middle of the front beam), and
has a tie rod on both ends. This needs to be replaced on 80% of the
buses we see with your problem. The easiest way to check it is to have a
friend move the steering wheel back and forth from tight to tight spot(
back and forth without turning the wheels). You will see the play at the
tie rod(s).
Also check the center link pin bushings the same way. The center link
pin is in the middle of the front end beam. The tie rods going to each
side of the bus come off the back of the center link. If there is any
play up and down from the rear of the center link, your bushings are
shot and need to be replaced. If that is the case, have a shop replace
the bushings as you need a special tool to R &amp; R them and a reamer to
ream the bushings once they are in.
You can also check the tie rods going to the wheels at the same time.
Look for movement in the tie rod ends when the steering wheel is moved
back and forth.
Also check your king and link pins for wear. Get a manual or have an
expert check them for you.
You can also adjust the steering box. Again, get a manual or have an
expert do it. To tight an adjustment will ruin the box.
Good luck. If you have any problems, give me a call and I will advise
you as to what to do.
