Hi Les,
Remove gas tank from bus and then cut off sheet metal!   Eric&amp;Barb&gt;&gt;

If only life were always soooooo simple. That is exactly the way I would
go about this. . . normally. But this poor old bus has been here soo
long, it is becoming one withe the earth. So getting under it to reach
engine bolts is close to impossible and a very disgusting thought to
boot. So, in this case, it seems better to remove the sheet metal so
that I can reach down to get at those engine bolts. Then I might just be
able to salvage that tank.

Les
