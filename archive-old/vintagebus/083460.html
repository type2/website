If water shoots out of your speaker grill when you turn on the dome light that 
means the 3 stooges did the wiring! 

Trace the coil wire back and see if it's attached to the wrong fuse terminal. 

 -Harry in Fresno

BTW, I'm finishing a week house sitting in Los Osos, Ca, while my '79 westy 
project waits for me in Fresno.  This is a small town of 15,000 and it seems 
every 5th vehicle is a VW bus, bay, vanagon or Euro. I know Go Westy is in town, 
but there are tons of 'em on the streets. More buses than bugs! There's a 
'66 13 window in the local paper for $1,900, no engine. Amazing.
