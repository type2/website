Subject: Re: [VB] Full flow filter on 1600

I take it that you mean pro/cons of filter pump vs full flow?

pros

oil filters are good
no hoses to route
no hoses to leak or get old
filter conviently located for oil changes

cons
oil pressure can be real high when it's cold and burst the filter (BTDT last 
winter)   I switched to 10/30 wt from 30wt, and switched to a spring release 
valve type filter
also may prevent you from having a stock muffler.

 sorry, not an answer, but I'm interested as well.
 
 there is a full flow filter attached to the AE engine in my new-to-me '65 
bus which I understand is a &quot;bolt on to the fuel pump&quot; design.
 
 can anyone enlighten me to the pros/cons of the system or direct me to a 
link?
 
 thanks,
