My neighbor wants me to buy his 66 panel, but the only problem is that he is
having trouble pulling the engine to fix the clutch. Seems he has the bolts
unbolted, but can not find where to hook the &quot;hook&quot; on the cherry picker. On
the manifold? Or would this rip out the studs on the heads? Asking for a
friend.
