Subject: Bitchen Camper FS-Prescott,AZ

There is a really nice Sundial/EZ Camper for sale in Prescott,AZ. The asking
price is $5000.00 USD. All white panel conversion. Sundial like interior
with appropriate style of spicerack in the photos. The description notes
*NO* rust or damage, rebuilt engine and tranny etc etc etc. It was
apparently a one owner (old man) bus until the most recent purchase by the
seller. Photos in an ad at a Phoenix area FLAPS look *really* nice and
complete. If you are even thinking of stepping up to $7000. Forget Mexico,
nab this one and give me the other two kay if you feel like spending the
whole budget!

Call Competition Engineering in Tempe,AZ and ask for the phone to the $5000.
&quot;Sundial&quot; Camper on the For-sale board. I think that the seller's name is
Brandon or something like that. Definitely a panel-dealer conversion. Also
appologize to Wayne the brain and Smiling George for me having everyone call
CE. (602) 966-8802. Caveat Empi~um,er,or,whatever.
*I have not personally inspected this bus but it looks great from the
photos! I don't know the seller* Happy Hunting~!
