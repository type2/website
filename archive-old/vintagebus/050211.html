Subject: Re: [VB] The benefits of women dealing on vehicles.

&gt;I think he's jealous.

You nailed it on the head Clara. I think we're ALL jealous! I wish I had
the affect on women that my wife does on men. Lets face it guys, women are
just smarter than us sometimes. We're so primal we get fooled by that
&quot;little smile&quot;. Oh well, better to just accept it and do the best you can
with it. I for one am happy that I converted my wife to VW's. She's not a
bus gal yet, but she tells me daily how much she just loves her 70 'vert.
Maybe if I could ever get my bus going she'll REALLY see the light.

I guess I'll try and gather some &quot;ammo&quot;. So ladies....which model bus is
your fav and why?
