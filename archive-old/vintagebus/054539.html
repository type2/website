Subject: Re: [VB] 6v Gas gauge on 12v?

I think the answer to that is the same as the old VW add about a Bug
floating.

It will definitely work, but it won't work indefinitely.

They will last an indeterminate amount of time, but will eventually fail. Of
course, the same can be said for a 12v gauge.

&gt; Ok, one question will fix two problems.
&gt;
&gt; I just bought an NOS 6v gas gauge, will it work if I convert my bus to
12v??
&gt; I've seen two different sources that said you can run the 6v one on 12v
with
&gt; NO modification.
&gt;
&gt; Also, my bud has a 67 and his fuel gauge is not working, I was wondering
if
&gt; I can replace it with my old 6v one and run it on 12v.
&gt;
&gt; See one question, two problems
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
