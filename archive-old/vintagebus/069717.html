Subject: Internal Radio Antenna?

Hey ppl.  When I had my bus redone, I decided to not reinstall the old 
antenna and had the holes filled.  Now I want to have a hidden modern radio 
and don't want to reinvent the wheel.  I've got the radio figured out, but 
am just looking around for a decent antenna to mount under the dash or in 
the back somewhere, maybe even inside the door?
