Subject: Engine Autopsy, long and boring

That's right. This is an autopsy report on a recently deceased engine. I
just dropped a valve in my truck engine a couple of weeks ago. I finally
got it all taken apart and I've measured a few things inside. Since
we've just been through the oil discussion, there may be some
interesting info here.

First off, some background on this engine. It's a 1600 DP, full flow
filter remote mounted, aluminum pump cover, CW crank .010/.010, swivel
valve
adjusters, 34 PICT 3 carb, single vac. dist., 8 mm head studs, Universal 
CD ignition. I originally built this engine almost exactly 100k miles
ago. At 40k the cheap reground crank broke. That's when I put in the CW
crank, new
bearings, new pistons and cylinders and a pair of heads that were
rebuilt by a local shop that I trust do do good work. The cam and
lifters looked great, so I put them back in. The case looked good, so no
line
bore. This means the engine was a 60k mile engine with a 100k cam,
lifters, and oil pump. I have used Castrol Syntec 5W-50 synthetic oil in
this engine right from the start except for during two break-in periods
of 3000 miles each. Now its time to shock some people. 8^) I change my
oil at 10k mile intervals. I know all the arguments againt that, but I
made the decision to go ahead and see what happened. I got on the list
just before Bob Hoover left, and I had the opportunity to read some of
his posts. I'll admit that I hadn't realized that the engine was pulling
air in around the pulley, but I decided to go on with my oil change
intervals and see what happened. As it turns out, I think I'll stick
with 10k oil changes and synthetic oil. I'll probably add a sand seal
for the additional protection, and I'll *never* try to get more than 50k
miles out of a valve job again. 8^)

Here's what I found: (besides busted pieces of piston all over the
place)
1.) Cleanest combustion chambers I've ever seen in a used engine.
Aluminum piston tops still visible. Probably due to CD ignition.
2.) Plenty of hatch pattern still visible on cylinder walls.
3.) Hatching till visible in rod bushings (small end).
4.) Rod bearings look like new. Only the one where the valve dropped had
some shiney spots. *No* copper visible.
5.) Main bearings look good. #2 does show some signs of wear, shiney
areas and a very narrow copper area exposed.
6.) Lobes on cam shiney, but no pitting. I'll use it again.
7.) Lifters are still convex. I'll use them too. I can hardly believe
this one.
8.) Oil pump is in fine shape. No wobble in the shaft. Only a few marks
in the housing from where it sucked up piston pieces. Gears look like
new.
9.) Oil pump cover doesn't even have a full circle worn into it from the
gears. I'll sand it and use it again.
10.) Rod journals measure all measure either 2.1551&quot; or 2.1552&quot;. Spec is
2.1546&quot; to 2.1554&quot; (.010&quot; regrind)
11.) Main #1 measures 2.1552&quot; max. 2.1550&quot; min. Min. is beside oil
holes. Spec is 2.1541&quot; to 2.1549&quot; (.010&quot; regrind). Looks like they
didn't quite get .010&quot; ground off.
12.) Main #2 measures 2.1555&quot; max 2.1552&quot;. In this case, the min is 90
deg. from the oil holes, which puts it right in line with the rod
journals. It looks to me like even the CW crank is flexing some.
13.) Main #3 bearing is still on the crank. sorry. 8^)
14.) Main #4 journal measures 1.5645&quot;. Spec is 1.5640&quot; to 1.5648&quot;

I thought that all looked pretty good. This was a bottom end that could
have easily gone 100k. Next time I'll do a valve job at 50K like I
originally planned to do with this engine. I think it would be
interesting to put one of the rods back on the crank with some
plastigage. If I do it, I'll post the results. Also, this engine got
driven 50% of the time at 70 mph with a 4.12 ring and pinion tranny on
the highway. The other 50% was in town driving. No gauges, so no temp.
info.

So there you have it. More information to clutter up your brain. 8^)

Now I have some questions. Does anybody have any experience with
aftermarket DP heads? Are the ones with 3/4&quot; spark plug threads any
good? What about valves? Anything better than stock?
