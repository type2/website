&lt;&lt; My '56 has the humpback as well, and judging from the upholstery 
 that was on it when I got it, it very well could have been original.
 
 The seats on the '55 are so ratty I can't tell!
 
 The '54 has flat seats.
  &gt;&gt;

I thought the hump in the seats started in 62?

I had written:
hey all.  While searching for truck bumper info I came across a tidbit less
than clearly worded implying that when the full width front  bench seat buses
switched (oct 60 VIN 673 946) from having one place to hook the seat into to 3
choices, that they also got the humped back of the front seat.  
..........
So I was thinking humpback was Oct 60 through July 62 (then they went to the
1/3, 2/3 front seat arrangement)

My  61 has the original seat, and the 3 places it can go,  it is a humpback
front seat.    I was wondering if you all had a correlation between having the
3 adjustment places, the date I found,  and the humpback, if it seemed there
was an original seat there. 

Vintage Nazi?
