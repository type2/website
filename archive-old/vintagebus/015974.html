Subject: The shroud and doghouse thread
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I think what this person was trying to ask &quot;Is there a
difference between a shroud and a doghouse?&quot;  

To answer your question, a doghouse is a *style* of
shroud, correct?  I think it's a later style shroud,
just as Thom said.  I'm not sure if earlier shrouds
had names, other than &quot;engine cooling tin.&quot;  IMHO,
stay the heck away from chrome cooling parts, even if
you chrome a perfectly good used shroud.  Chrome
reflects heat, and that seems counter-productive to
what cooling tin is supposed to do - diffuse and
exhaust heat. Even when you chrome used thicker stock
stuff, it's still chrome.

Good luck,
