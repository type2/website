Subject: nashville safari
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

while we're on the subject of safaris (maybe we're not
anymore, i'm kind of slow), i've been thinking about
getting them for my Dormobile since i cracked the
driver's side windsheild while removing it. it would
be nice to cruise through hillsboro village with the
windows flyin'. so what are everybody's thoughts on
safaris? who has them? are they worth the price and
the leakage? the way i figure is, what other vehicle
can you put safaris in? i might as well take advantage
of it if i have the opportunity. let me know what you
think.
