was writ:

I've towed my '65 with a standard tow bar available from any auto parts store.
The width is adjustable and it's designed to bolt onto the bumper brackets
of any car.
Just be careful not to stress out the bumper brackets with sharp turns.
I've towed type III's, Mitsubishis, Toyotas, and a '60 panel. If the thing has
been sitting for a long time the sreering mechanism will be stiff and will
make
it more stressfull on the brackets. The brackets on the '60 I towed bent,
although
it was a rust bucket, wich may have contributed.
- - - -  -
I wouldn't tow with the bumper/brackets- as it is likely to bend- it is not
designed to be used that way.   Get a tow bar that attaches to the torsion
tubes.
