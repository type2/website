&gt;Hey y'all
&gt;I thing I've got a bad sending unit.  When the bus is still not fully warmed

&gt;pressure gauge and light come on.  Of course I shut down immediately and go
&gt;out back to check.  Plenty of oil in the sump, sending unit wires are there.
&gt;  I'm running a dual output sending unit (light and gauge).  Any thoughts?

Any chance your dipstick is incorrect?  The only way I can get my pressure
to drop like that is to take a turn with one rear wheel spinning (and
believe me, it takes one heckuva drink-launching turn to do that) and low
oil level to begin with.  Then again, I have a type4 engine and I don't
know what type of engine you have.  Since you also posted to vintagebus I
bet you have a type1.  Oh well, never mind then.  :-)
