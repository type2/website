Ash Bob Dole replied when asked &quot;boxers or briefs&quot; - 'Depends'

Factors:

* amount of pigment in the paint - light colors don't cover as well
* color of the primer (light colorerd primers are easier to hide)
* type of paint
* amount of paint per coat

I used 1.5 gallons of VintageBus Yellow(tm) when I did my panel, and
about 8 coats.  Note: that's 1.5 gallons of *color* - it doesn't include
reducer, catalyst, etc.

&gt; Anyone know about how much paint it takes to repaint a well primered bus?  
&gt; Planning on about 3 coats or so.
