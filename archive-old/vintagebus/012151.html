Hi Volks,

Well thanks to SCAT engineering my problem is solved.  Spring loaded push
rod tubes ;0)  They cost a pretty penny but I think it will be worthwhile
in the long run.  I replaced the rightside in less than an hour with the
engine in.  OK, it took me a while to get the hang of compressing these
suckers and setting them in place.  I'll finish the other side tomorrow.
Will keep you all updated to how they are.



Joy thru air,

Jamie
