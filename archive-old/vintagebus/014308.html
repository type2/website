Ok, I know &quot;I&quot; am gonna piss everyone off too but
someone has gotta be on Steve's side ;-)

I eBay parts all the time.  As does Everett and as
does Thom...in fact I recall one of them even had a
seprate web page where you could go and see what he
has to bid on? (correct me if I am wrong and I may
be)...anyways I am not knocking that...I just find it
strange when very active eBayers and knockin some one
else for doin it?  And who cares whether he pre-posts
it or not??? Man talk about anal...at least let us
know where this BIG book of rules on selling our own
parts is so we can all properly file in line. 

Seems like folks are a bit uptight today...melow out
folks.  Be happy he has the parts for sale and you
know about them.

This is my opinion only ...$.02

&gt; I've received in less
&gt; time than it took me to print my orig. post about
&gt; eBay items :)
&gt; So because of a change of heart...I will offer BOTH
&gt; items, yes I said both
&gt; items here on the list first.
&gt; I want $500 for the rack
&gt; I want $500 for the tent  (incl. orig. bag too)
&gt; Is everybody happy now?
