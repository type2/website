&gt;If you use a U-Haul tow dolly.  Make sure to check the nylon straps
&gt;(that clamp the front wheels to the tow dolly) about every 50 miles
&gt;for looseness, and that you also use the safety chains to connect the
&gt;dolly directly to the front beam.

I'll second that.  When I towed my Bus from Houston to Tulsa on a U-Haul
flatbed, one of the straps kept coming loose.  The strap on the other
wheel, the chain on the front, and IIRC the chain in the back kept
anything drastic from happening, but I had to cinch up that one strap at
about every fuel stop.

I also remember that the ratchet for the other wheel strap was cranky
and didn't want to turn.  The next time I rent a car trailer, I am going
to make sure I have a small hammer, some Vice-Grips, and a can of WD-40
handy.
