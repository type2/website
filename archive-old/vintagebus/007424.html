On thing that I've noticed on EVERY engine that I've ever put a 009 on is
that I have to adjust the accelerator pump.  Without touching that
adjustment, I get stammering, flat spots, and all horrible manner of things.
In every case, I had to back off a little bit because I found out that
stammering was a rich condition from too much fuel.  Once I back off, I
usually get it to work really well.  Any further flat spots require a rivet
in the throttle plate or installing different jets.  You'd be surprised how
much messing with the accelerator can help...
