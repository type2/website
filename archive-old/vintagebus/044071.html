&gt; I have just aquired a '56 0r '57(not sure of year yet) kombi. What 
&gt; tail lights would be correct for a euro spec bus of this age. It came 
&gt; with semaphores if that helps.

Has it got a centre brake light? If it's a '56, it should have tail 
lights like Thom's '55 Westy (check out the picture 6/10/99 on his '55 
Euro Westfalia page - www.vintagebus_dot_com) Flat lens (as opposed to the 
US version which had a bubble lens) with hexagonal shape centre 
reflector pattern incorporated, round chrome surround with no external 
screws 

'57 model changed to have larger round brake/tail lights - chrome 
surround has external mounting screws visible. From a recent message: 
'The change occurred on 05 April, 1957 at ch # 246-964'
