Incorrect.  Standard procedure for pulling the engine on a bus with a
main/reserve valve is to put the valve in the &quot;half-way&quot; position,
which shuts off all flow (theoretically, you still get a slow drip
usually).

The only things I can think of on the clutch problem would be not
having put the friction plate in between the flywheel and the pressure
plate (unlikely), or a broken/bent throw-out arm, or a missing
throw-out bearing.  The latter is circular, a few inches in diameter,
and is supposed to be centered on the shaft from the transmission.
It's what pushes against the clutch pressure plate when you press on
the pedal.  No bearing, or one not in the correct position (unseated
from the arm, perhaps?), could easily give the symptoms you describe.
