Subject: roof top tents


  This was posted on another list and thought it might be of interest to
all.

  I have a Vintage car topper on my bus and used it the Classic weekend and
must say they are nice. Fill your bus with junk and sleep on the roof. Or
add a room so you can take even more people with you. The prices seem good
on these also.
