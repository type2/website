&gt;Do I seperate the body from the rusty '63 floor/chassis/running gear and
&gt;swap it with the buckled body of the '67 using the still good
&gt;floor/chassis/etc. so as to effectively have the good body on the good
&gt;chassis OR

No, cause it's not practical.  People have attempted &quot;frame-off&quot; restos on
buses, but it's a laborious, expensive process.

&gt;Do I fix all the rust holes in the body of the '63 and then set about
&gt;repairing or replacing the floor and then rebuilding the chassis and
&gt;running gear effectively rebuilding the whole car?

Yes.  Or find another bus that's in nicer condition but not running, and
mix and match the good parts.

&gt;Is it easy enough just to take one body off and swap it for another?

No

&gt;Will the '63 body go on the '67 floor/chassis?

No

&gt;Does the floor/chassis of a type2 separate from the body the same way a
&gt;beetle does?

No
