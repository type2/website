Subject: Re: [VB] Sending unit

Is the problem in the sender or the guage?   

One quick test it disconnect the brown wire from the push on connector on the 
sender.  Ground it to the bus somewhere.    Ya, you have to reach around the 
fan housing to get to it.  
Turn ignition on-  if the guage works, the needle will jump all the way to 
the right.  If the needle doesn't move, double check the ground is good- if 
it still doesn't move, check the wires at  the guage,  okay- still doesn't 
move- your guage is bad.   ie, if the power running through teh guage is 
fully grounded, it reads full.

To get to the sending unit, pull the motor and the gas tank .   You can take 
this opportunity to replace 

fuel line  - important!!!!!  
engine to body seal
main and oil cooler seals
tranny axle boots
change ancient gear oil in center section and RGBoxes
new rear brake hoses (easier with motor out) if you dont know how old they 
are,
replace grommets missing from engine- ie around fuel line where it goes 
through front engine tin.
etc

basically the 60,000 mi service, and plan on it taking a weekend.

&lt;&lt; I am trying to repair the broken fuel gauge on my son's 66 bus. How does 
one
 access the sending unit. I looked at one at a local body shop. There was a
 hole in the back deck and the top of the unit was clearly visible. There is
 no such hole in ours!? Was this an owners solution to reaching a difficult
 place? I was going to try grounding the sending unit, but now do not know
 how to get to it. Am I fixing(South Georgian) to cut me a hole?  Is there a
 better way to access it, if it need replacing?
 Thanks Ya'll
