People do that crap to try to prove a point, or teach a lesson. Like, you 
should of bought the bus, its your fault it got cut up. I would never do 
business with the company for having an attitude like that. Reminds me of a 
VVWCA president who used to post classified ads that said &quot;you better buy it 
or its gonna get cut up&quot; , or &quot;I had to cut it up, so that way I could make 
some money&quot;.
