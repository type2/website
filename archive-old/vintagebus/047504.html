Hi Rebecca,
The side popout windows are held onto the hinge by countersunk screws.  If
this area is so rusty that you can not see the screws you should try Navel
Jelly from your local hardware store to remove the rust.  Then hopefully you
can unscrew them or at worse drill them out.  As for curtains it kind of
depends what kind of camper you have if you are trying to restore it.  Eric &amp;
