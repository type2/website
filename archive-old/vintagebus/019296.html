was writ&quot;My other question is Does anyone have a roofrack that they would part
with? Is there a modern rack that will fit. It seems to me that most modern
ones do not have long enough legs. I need one for my roadtrip.&quot;

I believe all the modern racks would fit a bus, they make them with extra long
legs...i think i remember looking at thule and yakima racks, and I am pretty
sure they had ways of accomodating a bus. Although my memory is not that
great, and it was over three years ago.
