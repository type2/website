Subject: Re: price for tranny

And lastly, no-one answered my question for approximate value of a
 '65 tranny, condition unknown presumed working.  $20?  $50?  $100?
 $200?  $500?  No idea.  Got a seller, got a buyer, missing a price.
 Ideas, anyone?  I'd really appreciate this.
  &gt;&gt;

I sell large nut complete cores, when I have extras, for at least
$100.00.  If you have one that is known to be a good driver than I would
say $200-250.  I have one I plan to sell for around $200.00.  So if
anyone in the S.F. Bay Area needs one feel free to email me.
