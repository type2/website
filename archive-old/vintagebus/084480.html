Subject: Re: [VB] Upright Alternator Endplay

&gt; Just recently the 1600 in my 66 seems a bit louder. I tracked down the
&gt; sound to the alternator shaft moving in/out a bit. This engine has an
&gt; alternator conversion kit on it w/ a Bosch alt. Does anyone know of a
&gt; way of adjustment, or if the unit is simply shot?

FWIW, I checked a new Bosch AL82N I keep as a spare.   End play was
.070&quot; (without pulley or fan), which seemed to be due mostly to the
bearings moving in the case itself.    If that didn't tighten up after
adding the fan and pulley hubs, it seems like you could either add a
larger spacer at the fan end, or maybe add shims between the bearing
and the end plates to tighten it up.

The bearing at the fan end was an SKF 6202-2RS1/HT22VT192, which
according to the Bosch Catalogo Rolamentos 2004 corresponds to Bosch #
9101082215.  Bearing at the pulley end was 6203-2RS1/C3HT22, which is
Bosch # 1900905271.

Internal regulator is Bosch # 9190087003.

Carbon brushes are accessible by removing the plastic plate that
contains the D+ terminal (held down by three screws) and disconnecting
the spade terminals.  I didn't find a part number on the brushes or
holder.

It seems to me that this model of alternator would be reasonably cheap
and easy to rebuild mechanically.   I'd be interested in hearing how
it goes if you decide to rebuild it yourself.
