Subject: Rick and Ronnies report

Hi,

Went over to Rick and Ronnies Diner this afternoon for the
SouthBay/Midcities DubClub meet. Had about a 15 air cooled vehicles. One
Ghia, a bunch of bugs and about 5 buses. They were headed over to the DKP
cruise, but I did not go. Met Matt and Nathan from Australia. They flew in
from down under 3 days ago. There arms were still really tired, but they
were really enjoying their stay and looking forward to a week of air cooled
Southern California hospitality and the the OCTO and Classic next weekend.

Chris
