Hi David,

well, your just gung ho on a saturday morning.      lets see-  The axle shaft
comes from the transmission through the axle tube.  it comes through a bearing
in the inboard hald of the Reduction Gear Housing, then a gear is slid on the
shaft, another bearing fit on, (usually with something to push while turning a
bolt into the end of the shaft), then a circliip.

the gear on the axle shaft meshes with a gear on the stub axle (which you
actually slid the drum onto and put the big nut on.     The stub axle has a
bearing at the inboard end which fits into the  RGH on the axle tube.
Outboard of the stub axle gear,  there is a spacer (PN 211 501 281 B), then
there is  another bearing.   
 (I am describing the 64-67 kind, BTW- dont you have a 67)

you said the outer upper and the outer lower were bad?  you got the outer
upper off- how is the inner upper?

how to get that lower one off-  i would try some sort of puller,   Probably
use heat- that often persuades things to move.  People try and confuse and
disuade me by explainung that things tighten against each other when heated,
but If I blithley ignore them it often works (wonders), loosening things from
each other.

...........
Well, James and I got the upper bearing inner race off with a hammer and
screwdriver, but the lower race (on the wheel spindle) still won't come off.
There is a large washer or flange behind the bearing and we are not sure if it
is part of the bearing or not. If somebody doesn't give us an idea how to
remove this pretty soon, we might just split the bearing inner race off with a
hammer and cold chisel, but I hate to bang on it too much for fear that I may
damage the bearing on the other side of the gear. I would greatly appreciate
it if someone would post or e-mail me some advice...
