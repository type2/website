Subject: RE: [VB] Highroof Rear Hatch


Thanks, I think you are right.  Never actually tested it myself, but your 
answer is the same as others have told me.  There IS a difference.
Less curvature means highroof hatch.

Thanks,

Charles

&gt;Hi!
&gt;
&gt;	I guess Ronnie has outed me again...
&gt;	Unfortunately, I did not find a specific way to tell the difference 
&gt;between
&gt;the two types of rear hatches.
&gt;
&gt;	I was mainly looking to answer the same question you originally had.  Are
&gt;they different.
&gt;
&gt;	The only thing I can add, is pretty much what everyone else has said.
&gt;There is little to no curve to the high roof door.  Look at it from a side
&gt;profile and see if you can notice a definite arch from top to the bottom of
&gt;the door.  If you notice it straighten out near the top, then it's most
&gt;likely a high roof door.
&gt;
&gt;	Pretty much, you need to try installing it on a bus to find out 100% sure.

&gt;If Roger N is out there he might have the answer. At the last few shows
&gt;I've seen him at he was checking out every High Roof rear hatch there 
&gt;trying
&gt;to figure out if and what were the differences

&gt; &gt; Does anyone have a procedure that I can follow to
&gt; &gt; determine whether a rear

&gt; &gt; standard panel van?  I've
&gt; &gt; heard there is a difference in the hatch curvature
&gt; &gt; between a highroof and a
&gt; &gt; regular bus.
