Hi list,   I worked on the 65 camper sunday.  Replaced the master
cylinder, (finally got that clevis pin out) bleed the brakes, adjusted
the valves, changed the oil, replaced the fuel lines.  Runs great!  Ive
had this bus for about 2 years and have got it painted, new seat covers
for the front, repaired door hinges,  rebuilt the engine, ect.  I drove
over to the guys house that sold me the bus as I had to show him the
progress that I've made.  He seemed happy and sad at the same time. 
Happy that the bus has a good home but sad  he never had the time or
money  to put into it.  I must have thanked him  five times .  I think I
love this bus..........     Pictures to be posted this
week!																									     jon in san diego
