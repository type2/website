I've used black plasti-dip on a few racks.  I suspend the rack so the legs
are at working height.  Cut the bottom of a 2L soda bottle, and pour
the plasti-dip into that.  Remeber to stir it well first - it does make
a difference!  Then *slowly* rais your tub of plasti-dip into the rack
leg, and even MORE SLOWLY lower it.  When I say SLOW, I MEAN SLOW - if you
go too fast, it leaves too much behind, and it's all lumpy.  By drawing it
down slow, you allow the excess to flow back into the cup, because the 
material in the cup will pull some of the plasti-dip off of the leg.  Let
it dry for a short period of time, and apply another layer.  I usually do
3 layers.  Let it dry for at least a day before monkeying with it again.

On the clamps, use the same procedure, except you dunk them and lift them
out SLOWLY.  Then hang them to dry.

&gt; What do you guys use on the bow ends and clamps to protect your roof...
&gt; My fresh SWR paint needs protection!
&gt; I think a plasti-drip product of some sort used to be the talk of the list... 
&gt; Procedure? is this the best
