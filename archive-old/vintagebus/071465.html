Subject: Re: [VB] Freeway Flyer Tranny

I've got a 1600 sp in my bus with a 3.88 r &amp; p freeway flyer.  If you insist
on going with a 1600 sp, you'll need to do some performance upgrades (dual
carbs, header, maybe some ratio rockers, etc..) as a 1600 sp just really
don't have quite enough power for such tall gearing (in my opinion).  But
mine is still my daily driver and gets me around town just fine.  The only
thing is at 40-45 mph, i'm still in third gear, turning about 35-3800 RPM.
There's just no power in 4th at that speed (you'll be at about 2000-2300 RPM
at that speed in fourth).  I'd defenitely recommend the 3.88 freeway flyer,
it's awesome for highway driving.

&gt; Hi list,
&gt; This question has probably been asked a thousand times:
&gt;
&gt; Planning on putting in a fresh 1600 sp into my 67 Sundial Camper.  I want
to
&gt; also redo the tranny with a 3.88 ring &amp; pinion.  I have a friend who is a
vw
&gt; mechanic who is trying to talk me out of this combination.  He states that
&gt; the higher gear ratio will make it hard for me to climb hills with my bus.
&gt; While I know that this is probably true, most of my driving in So. Cal is
&gt; generally on pretty flat freeways.  The benefit of getting better mileage
&gt; and my engine turning fewer rpms on the freeway seems to outweigh the
&gt; occasional hill that I might encounter.  But I also tend to drive on 3-4
&gt; lane surface streets with 40-45 mph speed limits.  I occasionally drive my
&gt; bus, which now has a 1600 sp with a stock tranny in 4th gear occasionally
on
&gt; these streets.  I wonder if the freeway flyer 4th gear will be too high
for
&gt; this type of driving?  Anyone have any experience/recommendations for
this.
&gt; I'm not willing to go to a larger engine, as I like the simplicity and
&gt; reliability of a 1600.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Ed Richardson
