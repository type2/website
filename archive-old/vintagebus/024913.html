Subject: Hatch springs - spawn from Re: DECKLID SIZES?
Message-ID: &lt;36FFA37F.1D41_at_camtech_dot_net.au&gt;

&gt; Off the main subject here but I was wondering if the 68-71 lids would
&gt; work on the 66-67's? How about the rear hatch?
&gt; - - -  --
&gt; engine lid no, rear hatch yes through some bay window year bus not sure when.
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

Would it be at all possible to use the springs off the hatch on the '67
to spring load the hatch on the '63 ?
