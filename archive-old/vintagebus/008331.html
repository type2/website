Just for the record, I just found one (55 SC) in Oklahoma City for a buddy!
He bought it, but hasn't done anything with it yet. Josh was considering
buying it before he passed away. It would be runnin around with safaris by
now if he were still with us!
The truck was redone and customized about 20 years ago. Everything, I mean
everything 55 has been changed! So we are hunting
parts.(taillights,decklid,bumpers,etc.)

&gt; &gt; how rare is a 55 pickup and what is the range of prices, before and
after
&gt; restoration?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I won't say rare because I've seen a few.
&gt;
&gt; There's at least 1 in Florida (listee), my friend had one that sold to
&gt; England (Euro model), I know of a couple Barndoor '55s, one of them here
in
&gt; Phoenix, and there's one on recycler_dot_com for $5k right now, seems over
&gt; priced by the photo there.
&gt;
&gt; Oh yeah, and Thom might spring to have that logo'd one in NorCal
air-lifted
&gt; out.  Do it!  ;)
&gt;
&gt; So that's 6 off the top of my head.  Scarce, I'd say.  '55s rule.
&gt;
&gt; BTW, there's a '55 Kombi for sale in my classifieds right now, $4k, sounds
&gt; pretty good.
