HI,

Anyone near Almaden Valley willing to do a first-hand review of a type2 for
me?  I'm good for a case of beer if that helps motivate you &lt;grin&gt;.
Seriously, if you can help me out, I'd appreciate it.  Not looking for
anything but a check of the body, checking for signs of repair or rust.  No
need to test the engine or anything...  should be a 5 or 10 minute visit.

E-mail me and I'll give you details.

Has anyone heard from Gerald since he moved?  He said he would be back on
the net within a couple of weeks, but it has been over a month...

  Stephen Gutknecht
  Renton, Washington
