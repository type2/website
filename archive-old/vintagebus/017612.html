I parked the '63 Sleazy camper in the street Monday
night. It's usually in the driveway but my wife needed
ingress/egress to the drive. I didn't feel like moving
it back in after her reappearance at the house. I was
still burnt out following my return from the Pomona
trip from hell. 
Tuesday 4:30AM I woke up to my alarm per the usual.
The majorly deafening noise did not cease upon
switching the clock to OFF. The racket continued
outside my lovely house.
Wop!,wop!,wop!,wop!,wop!,wop!,wop!,Wooooooooo! Notar
helicopter sounding like a leaf blower in the sky,
spotlights waving like some grand opening for a new
barrio or something. Looked outside and some guy was
running down the street like a Dick Tracy cartoon
silhouette hiding in the shadows dodging the
spotlight.  I grabbed the phone and dialed 9-1... Cop
cars came from two directions about the time that I
was about to hit the last 1. I hung up, I thinking
that it was  before the second &quot;1&quot;. Cops on the scene
apparently had it under control. I hung up and grabbed
for my shorts. Baby started crying about the same time
that the phone started ringing! Fuh-me-! WHAT now???
Wop!,wop!,wop!,wop!,wop!,wop!,wop!,Wooooooooo! Notar
helicopter continued to sound like a leaf blower in
the sky. Baby continued to sound like a leaf blower in
the house. Wooooooooo!
9-1-1 operator... did you have an emergency?
Wooooooooo! Wop!,wop!,wop!,wop!,wop!,wop!,wop!,
Wooooooooo!
I struggled to keep my balance, 1/2 in and 1/2 out of
my shorts, my two inches of death dangling, baby
crying, helicopter droning 10 feet above my tree line,
man running, cops coming, me trying to wake up, no
glasses, can't see, hair looking like Buck Wheat....
Wife sleeping right through it all.
The cops had my white '63 EZ camper with guns drawn
pointing at the bus as if it were the logical place
for a criminal to be... Driver! come out of the
vehicle! Do it now! Show us your hands!

911 op &gt;&gt; &quot;Sir!, do you have an emergency?!!
Me &gt;&gt; &quot;Uh, well, um, alarm clock and the guy and cops
and then the helicopter Wop!,wop! woooo! and um, noise
every where, loud, helicoters suck, plus the baby
woooo!!! and my balance and wife wanted to move here
but I said Prescott but that didn't fly, and uh bad
boys bad boys whatcha g...&quot;
911 op &gt;&gt; &quot;SIR!, do you have a 911 emergency?!!!!!
I painfully told the lady that the cops had my vehicle
surrounded and that the actor in question was running
the other way and hung up after she cleared with the
officers on scene.

I carefully turned on the porch light and gingerly
stepped outside when (OK to do so) fully expecting to
be thrown to the ground in a full felony stop
procedure. The cops were informed that the vehicle was
mine and that the &quot;perp&quot; had run right by them while
they were molesting my bus.
Just an average morning in my neighborhood. Birds
cheerfully chirping, the sun gleefully rising in God's
new world, the theme from Leave it to Beaver playing
somewhere in my head, another 120 illegal aliens (with
more apparent rights than ranchers) yanked out of the
Coyote house down the street. Bills due, baby hungry,
some scruffy dude with a three wheeled shopping cart
shuffling by~ looking like me if I don't hold my
job... Ah, life could not be better~! Paula once again
slept through the entire episode and continues to
enjoy the neighborhood.
Newspaper kid quietly peddles the bike down the street
and delivers a neighbor's newspaper with a gentle
plopping noise. I bark out &quot;HEY! hold it down over
there would ja!???&quot; He looks back not knowing what hit
him. I fire up the '63 Sleazy camper, put the ear
plugs in my ears and drive off into the sun for
another 25 mile commute. Ah! Mid-city VW life- you
just can't beat it. =)
