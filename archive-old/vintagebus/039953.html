The new &quot;Republican guard&quot; is going to strip mine the Alaskan wilderness now 
anyway.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't see what issues the greenies would have with the dishwasher 
&gt;idea.
&gt; &gt; I think it's a dang site better than a) chemdip b) carb cleaner in the
&gt; &gt; driveway
&gt;
&gt;Well exactly and besides, if you are washing your car and engine at the
&gt;carwash, it goes down the drain anyway.  Just don't tell Al Gore what you
&gt;are doing.  Probably doesn't matter now anyway...
