Subject: [VB] More Fuel Guage Fiasco (Got any parts for me?)

Tonight I cracked down on my fuel guage dilemma.  I pulled the guage from
the bus and disassembled the sending unit.  Turns out that the grounding
point inside the sender was corroded enough that standard external methods
of grounding wouldn't suffice.  After hooking up a plethora of wires based
upon the schematic in the Bentley, I got the fuel guage to move but only
about 1/16&quot; of an inch.  This is common when mix and matching sending units
and guages.

And then the needle on the guage broke.

I think I'll just order a new sender and guage and get it over with.
