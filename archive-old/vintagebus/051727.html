&lt;&lt; I have (after some more research) found it necessary to say that the solex 
34-pict 3 carb is paired with an 009 distributor. Does this complicate 
matters? &gt;&gt;

Hi Nicholas,
Definitely, or at least if your 009 wieghts have not been oiled at least once 
every 3,000 miles they could be stuck and not allowing the distributor to 
advance properly.  If you still think you are sucking air, check your seals 
of the intake manifold, and for any holes in the manifold itself.  Eric&amp;Barb
