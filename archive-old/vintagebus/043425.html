&gt;so now that i realize that i need an inverter of some sort, i went to jc
&gt;whitney and they have two different inverters to change from 6 to 12 volt.
&gt;high current and low current, price varies from 59.99 to 89.99.
&gt;what i would like to have hooked up is a oil temp gauge, oil press, and
&gt;tachometer....eventually i would like to hook up a stereo so i don't have
&gt;to use the little portable one i use now.

The oil temp and pressure gauges should work fine on the inverter.
The tach may or may not care for dealing with 12v power and a 6v
signal at the coil.  The radio will be your biggest draw, probably.

I picked up a couple of Archer (Radio Shack) inverters at the last
VW show for $10 each.  3A, 12V max output, but this would be more
than enough for your gauges.  A second one would run a low-powered
radio, but you'd need more for a bigger radio - 3A _at_ 12V is 36W -
if your radio was perfect at converting input energy to output
energy you could have 18Wx2ch but it's not, so plan on more like
6Wx2ch to 10Wx2ch.

As far as where to hook it up...The inverter for the gauges needs
to be hooked up so that it only runs when the ignition switch
is on.  Probably the easiest place to do that is at the brake
lights fuse...pull the brake light fuse, turn on the key, find
out which end of the brake light fuse holder is still live,
and connect your inverter there (through an inline fuse that
will probably be supplied with the inverter).

The radio is a more interesting thing.  Original VW radios were
hooked up to the always-hot wire for the battery, so you could
listen with the key off.  If they were hooked to the ignition
wire (key on to hear tunes), you could conceivably be sitting
there with the key on, engine off, points closed, draining
your battery and cooking your coil.

However, you probably don't want to hook the inverter directly
to the always-hot power, because it will draw a little power
all the time and you may have battery drain problems.  Probably
the easiest thing to do is to hook it to the always-hot power
through a toggle switch.  Best place for this would probably
be at the far right stock fuse, on the same terminal as the
fat red wires.  Come off this terminal, through an inline
fuse, to one side of the toggle switch...other side of the
switch goes to the inverter input, and the inverter output goes
to the radio.

&gt;so i can listen to fm and cds during the long trips...

You may not be able to listen to AM very much.  The inverter(s)
will probably make some noise on your radio, which won't bother
FM or CD too much, but may make a mess on the AM side.

Good luck!
