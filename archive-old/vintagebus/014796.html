Hello all,

I will be in need of some interior parts and am having a hard time finding a 
junk yard that even has buses. I live in northern Indiana and am at school 
around Indy. Any suggestions about where to find some parts buses and 
junkyards? Also just wondering if there are any list members in my area of 
the world.
thanks

Scott
