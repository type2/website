&gt; IF I switched from big nut in my '66 to an earlier small nut RGB what would
&gt; the difference in gear ratios be?  Hopefully the same.  From what I can 
&gt; tell
&gt; it is a direct swap.

Hi Adrian,
Depends on what R&amp;P and tire size you are using.  Generally if you are using 
a 4.375 R&amp;P with stock diameter tires you will notice about 3MPH drop.  With 
3.975 R&amp;P and stock diameter tires it be more like 6 MPH drop.  

&gt;&gt;I am assuming the difference in gearing for the early splits was in the
transmission itself and not the RGBs? &lt;&lt;

Incorrect!
