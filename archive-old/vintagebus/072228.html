&lt;&lt; Guess that's about all .. hope to have more pictures when it is clean, new
 seats, and of course, the paint job.

thanks for sharing you bus project.   Updates are cool, don't feel you have 
to wait till it's done to tell use about it.  It's nice to get installments.   

Good luck on the body work and on finding a good (and reliable) body guy.

Clara
