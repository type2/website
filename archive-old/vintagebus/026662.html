&gt;I've just been to Radio Shack, and the guy looked at me like I was from Mars when I asked for a 6v to 12v voltage converter.  Is there a source for these anymore?
&gt;
I have an extra one of these, I believe it is a Radio Shack one, too.  I haven't used it in a year but it worked at that time.  Someone gave it to me for the cost of shipping so I'll do the same - $3.20.  Downside?  I don't remember the wiring instructions, but it's pretty easy.

I could bring it to the Phx. Bug-O-Rama or Kelley Park too, then you get it for free, except for the standard US $1 billion handling fee, payable only in pennies.  ;)
