Subject: cleaning rims?

Finally got my order for new tires in, and was going to get the rims powder
coated between tire mountings...but it was a bit pricier than I imagined.
They were galvanized maybe 4 years ago-no signs of rust.

I thought maybe I would just paint them, but they are very dirty. So I'm
trying to get them pretty clean before attempting to paint them. Peeling
paint would look worse than the galvanized coating. Actually the galvanized
finish doesn't look too bad, I just thought a white finish might look a
little nicer, closer to stock. Maybe I should wait until the next round of
tire changes to get them powder coated, or maybe if it ain't broke don't fix
it...

Options...
1. spring for the powder coating(pretty pricey, think I'd rather spend the
money on body work)

2. leave them as is (they look ok, no peeling paint or anything, sort of a
greyish color.)

3. try to get them clean so I can paint them.(task seems daunting, as the
grease or road grime or brake dust is not really coming off; I've tried some
engine degreaser on them...but the dirt doesn't really want to come off.
maybe naval jelly-sort of an acid wash?)

My plan if I paint is to do two rims at a time, as I have two spares. So I
can take tires off rims, clean, paint, mount two tires than do the same to
the next two.

Just trying to think this through...

Probably just rambling...
