I think Wolfsburg west has some NOS ones (or at least they're claiming to
be).  I got one and it has vw stamped on it.

Good luck and sorry about the SOB that stole your mirror.  I used to live in
Seattle and they would continually pick over my 75 scirroco for parts...

Mine got swiped Tuesday night; noticed it yesterday and was mad all last
night.

Anyone have one for sale?

Who makes the best re-pop?

Thanks,
