I am planning on taking the fam to the Puyallup show this weekend and am
wondering if anyone has any type of &quot;agenda&quot; for it? The Puyallup show is at
the fairgrounds, right? Coming from Portland, OR anyone know which exit to
take? (Oh, take the one that says &quot;Puyallup&quot;? Thanks...)(exit number...)
Is the swapmeet for Sat and Sun? Please get some details to me... Gracias.
Jon
