hey all,  I have a 67 micro and all of a sudden my shifting was rough and i 
hear a metal swirling screeching noises when i push in the clutch.  I just 
adjusted the clutch and the shifting is back to normal but the metal 
screeching swirling sound has gone down but is still pretty loud.  I just 
replaced the throughout bearing about 1700 miles ago and was wondering if 
that is the problem and why it only lasted 1700 miles.  any hints are well 
apreciated   peace out
