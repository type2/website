Subject: Re: [VB] Third wire on Generator where goes?

yes, the forward screw on the generator near the fan shroud is for a ground.  
 They do work w/o a ground wire there.

but you can run a brown ground wire from that screw and attach it where the 
voltage regulator is screwed to the body of the bus.

1600 DP, 12volt system.  On the generator there are
the two terminals that connect with wire to the voltage regulator.  There is 
also a third screw on top toward the front (front means front ;^) of the
gernerator where another wire attaches with a ring-type connector.
Where does this third wire go to?  Does it just go to a body ground???
