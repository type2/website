Subject: Hot weather oil
Date: Wed, 14 Jun 2000 12:50:52 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I know that there has been a bit of discussion on the weight of oil for hot
weather driving.  Some dummy didn't really follow that close and is now
about to make a 1000mi r/t in his 66 van in 100+ temps.

Here in town (Vegas ) where it gets over 115 often, I run a straight 40 in
summer and, plan my trips so I only run 15-20 min at a time and then stop
for up to an hour but, going to be going to Salt Lake City end of the month
and, it's all I-15 all the way, so, any suggestions?

TIA

Jon
