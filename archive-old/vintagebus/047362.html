&gt; Hi all;
&gt;  When I turn on the lights in my 6v bus, the gas needle goes all the way to 
&gt;  full no matter how much gas is actually in the tank. When the lights are 
off,
&gt;  
&gt;  or on but with the dimmer all the way towards low light, the gage works 
&gt; great. 
&gt;  Interestingly enough, the same thing is happening in  both of my buses, so 
I 
&gt; 
&gt;  figured there was a big chance that someone else had experienced this and 
&gt; knew 
&gt;  what is happening.
&gt;  

Bad ground- when you turn the lights on the guage grounds through the lights. 
 Loosen the guage holder to the bus thing, scrape it a bit move it around to 
renew the ground, and snug the knurls down.
