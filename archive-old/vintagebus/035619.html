&lt;&lt;Creative Engineering sells front Safari kit (primer) for $420 - for a '67.

Wolfgang Int, sells them for $389 - I take it it's worth the extra few bucks

for the Creative?


Just noticed that Creative also sells pop-out window frames.  I was just

about to order a set of 6 from Wolfgang - any one have recommendations

either way?


Thank you.
