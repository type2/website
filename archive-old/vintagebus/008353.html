I'm all for it.  When I joined the list way back when, I knew from the
minute I posted that it was a public forum and that copies of my posts would
float around the net.  If anyone has a problem with their stuff being
distributed, then they shouldn't post on a public forum.  You could spend
years trying to track down your info if you were serious about copyright and
enforcing all the laws that go with it.  Remember the old saying about
putting all your eggs in one basket?  Drop the basket and you are screwed.
If we only allow certain websites or one main server to hold the archive and
it crashed, the posts are gone forever.  If they are out there floating
around on CD, chances are good the archives could be setup again should
something catastrophic happen.   I'm all for free distribution of
information.  I encourage my posts to float around and be put to use.  I
really don't care if someone makes money off of them either.  As long as
someone somewhere benefits from my writings, then I'm cool with it and it
serves to stake my claim in history and then I can go down as somewhat of a
VW legend - especially should I die an untimely death for some odd reason.
I want people to know I'm having a blast with my VWs and long after I'm
gone, I'd like others to be able to read my posts and benefit from them and
wonder just who this NQ fellow was.
