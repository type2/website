It worked very well for both my Sqbk and bus (when, I had one . . . sniff) for adjusting the
wingnut variety clutch adjusters.

I took a steel tube (probably from a handle on
a broken floor jack handle) cut a pair of slots
in it to fit over the end of the clutch cable and
so the slot fit over the wings nut.  The other 
end was easy, I placed a 1/2 inch square drive
socket extension in there and formed (smashed)
the tube into a square shape to fit.

Then with the help of a swivel adapter, a 
speed handle and extensions, the clutch wingnut
was very easy to turn either way.  A vice grip
or similar tool clamped to the cable forward
of the lever but NOT on the cable itself keeps
the cable itself from twisting.

Ywah, I know the forward upper tin is in the way,
but be creative, and you can get around it with
a little pushing and shoving.
