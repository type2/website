&gt; Hi Phil,
&gt; Definitely use only the red FW seals.  They are made of silicon and do not
&gt; harden up like the black or blue FW seals.  You might try Ronnie for them.
&gt;   Make sure to check that your oil pressure relief valve/s are stock!  We
had
&gt; an engine rebuilt and could not get it below 60 PSI for that reason when
&gt; warmed up in 70 F outside temps.  80+ PSI and you distort the oil cooler
and blow
&gt; FW seals.

Funny you should mention oil pressure. Sometimes when I start the engine the
oil pressure &quot;pegs&quot;at 70 psi on the VDO gage and sticks there. It then drops
off to about 40 psi. Acts like the pressure relief or something is hanging
up.

I do have the red seal (Elring of America made in ROC) which seems to be
what everyone sells. I think its silicon.

I think my problem was not polishing the flywheel sealing surface well
enough. There was a small pit and shallow grooves,marks which I have now
polished out. And the new seal seems to fit the polished suface with enough
interference to seal.
