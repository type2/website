&gt; After swapping the glass pack thing the PO had on there with the crummy

Hi Greg,
First congrats on your engine exchange!  Next get rid of the bug muffler and 
get a bus muffler.  VW designed the bus only muffler in the late 1950s and 
this was due to the very flat rear of the bus.  Which collects all the exhaust 
gas behind it if a bug muffler is used and if there is a tiny hole in the rear 
hatch, engine lid, or engine to body seals the exhaust is sucked into the 
engine compartment via the cooling fan or at higher speeds the interior of the bus 
is at a lower pressure than the air passing just outside the bus!

&gt; Only thing of concern is that it backfires a little when I let off the gas 
&gt; or shift down for the oncoming red light.  Nothing too loud of obnoxious, but 
&gt; its there. 

Check the Workshop Manual Section K-2, pages 21-22, it sounds like #5.
