OK great directions but has it been mentioned that the rocker shaft
assembly must be removed or is there another way?

 in (initial torque sequence)--tighten all to 1mkg, or 10nm or (i hate
foot
 lbs) 7ft.lbs
 THEN in FINAL torque sequence--torque M10 nuts to 3.0 to 3.2mkg, or
 30-32nm, or (those stupid ft.lbs again) 22-23ft.lbs.
   or M8 nuts to 2.5mkg, or 25nm or (damn ft. lbs again) 18ft. lbs.  in
the
 specified sequence.
  PLEASE NOTE: the INITIAL TORQUE SEQUENCE  is  DIFFERENT  from the 
FINAL
 TORQUE SEQUENCE!!
 i've built a few motors, and have talked to alot of old timers, and
they
 say it's ok to go over, and some even torqued 10mm nuts to 30ft
 lbs(whatever THOSE are), but only if the case had been case savered. 
the
 smaller studs are better alloy and don't stretch as much, hence the
lower
 torque, but again, some oldtimers with 1000's of motors behind them,
say
 it's ok to go to about 22-23ft. lbs (can someone explain this american
 measurement for a metric application?).
 i personally have an 8mm stud engine with 70K+ on it.  have checked
torque
 many times, never have been loose, and only have them torqued to 30nm
