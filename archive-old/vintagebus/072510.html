&gt; Anyone know of a source for coloured dash light bulbs?   I have a yen for red 
&gt; ones for the guages in my 61, to match the dash.  Do you think it'll work if 
&gt; I paint the bulbs?

Paint might be a bit opaque, however I have colored glass with a
sharpie marker that stays put quite well. This very well might work on
a glass bulb also. worth a shot, at least.
