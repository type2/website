&gt; I have the same philosophy.  I bought a 1 inch breaker bar but now I'm

&gt; a 36mm was $28!  That's more than I paid for the breaker bar (used).  Anyone
&gt; know of a place to buy 1 inch sockets?

WOW!  1-inch drive!  What a man!

When you get up to 1-inch you are getting out of the &quot;consumer&quot; catagory,
so you're stuck with industrial suppliers.  There isn't enough volume to
keep the prices down.

You might check out inch-dimensioned sockets (1-7/16 = 36mm).  They might
be cheaper than metrics (in the US at least), and they fit just as well.
