Subject: '59 Kombi...ran out of gas today

On the way home from work, I started looking at the miles I've put on 
my '59 Kombi since I last filled it up. With no gas guage or reserve 
switch, I've been keeping a log of my gas fill-ups and miles and 
such. Well ironically as I was figuring out in my head how many miles 
I had put on, I ran out of gas! Luckily I was fairly close to a gas 
station. Me and my son hitched a ride about 1/2 mile to get a few 
gallons of gas. Filled up the bus and drove right to the same pump I 
got the 2 gallons from. I jotted down all my numbers.  My figures 
show right at 18 miles per gallon on gas usage. I'm sure I'll get a 
better idea as I get more numbers and can start averaging. But at 
least I know how many miles I can go on my tank at this moment. Won't 
run out of gas again....right!!!
