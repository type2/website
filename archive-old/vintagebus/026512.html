I have been following this thread for some time. I finally decided I
need to put my own two cents in.

Having been a small business owner and having failed miserably at it I
feel it necessary to make the following observation. In my own case, I
was simply too damned kind to my customers. I gave them too good a deal:
bent over backwards to please them. In the end, it caught up to me. I
can still remember that terrible sinking feeling when I realized I could
no longer go on. And the feeling of helplessness that accompanied it.
And wondering why some of these businesses (some of the biggest
restaurants in the Washington DC area) didnt step in and help me out for
once, as I had done for them so many times over the years. Of course,
they didnt and it was unrealistic to think that they would.

And this seems to apply here. It sounds as if both of these individuals
took great pride in their work. Too much perhaps. Or they just didnt
charge enough for their services. And the folks that benefited from
their handiwork arent about to step up now and send em an extra ten
bucks, although maybe they should.
