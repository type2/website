I have to question the wisdom of converting a truck to electric, then
immediately cramming a huge stereo in it...

And a 40 mile range?  I guess it's a good thing it's a single cab; you can
keep your bicycle in the back...

And the thing doesn't even have bumpers?

Who was the yahoo that appraised this thing at $16,287.75?

I like the phrase &quot;The chassis is a rare and collectible VW classic, which
has undergone improvements above and beyond full restoration, as well as
conversion to electric power.&quot;  That's like saying &quot;I drove to work this
morning, and then some!  I just drove south when I was supposed to be
driving north!&quot;

Electric cars are fine, but they could have picked a crappy car to start
with..

&gt;I don't have any other details except to say that EV's are great! My
&gt;electric Thing is saving me money while the price of gas goes up past
&gt;$1.70/gal. here in California. Fill the batteries every month with a
&gt;buck's worth of distilled water and $1.50 worth of Reddy Kilowatt and
&gt;I'm good for 30 miles a day.
