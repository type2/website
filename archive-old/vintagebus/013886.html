These safaris were mainly NOS units before installed,
frames, orig VW glass, weld ons were all nos other
parts were mint used...worth every penny.

See, I WANT to keep them for my other bus, thus the
price, make sense?  Where am I gonnna find another set
of all original VW safaris in this condition??  It is
near impossible.  

If the price seems high...just wait until you decide
to restore yours! ;-)

&gt; A grand for safari windows?  Wooo hooooo!  I've
&gt; almost tripled my investment
&gt; on the last set I bought.  I'd be interested if
&gt; someone really pays that
&gt; much.
