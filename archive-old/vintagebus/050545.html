&gt;&gt;Hi everyone,   I am new to this list.  I am considering buying a'62 bus and would like some advice as to wether or notthe $1200 asking price is reasonable&lt;&lt;

Matt,
Alot depends on what part of the country you are in.  I have shopped for a LOT of buses in Ohio, and from my experience, $1200 for a GOOD running bus that is &quot;fixable&quot; is completely reasonable. It seems in the midwest you can't touch a running split window for less tahn $1500.  However, if you are out West, I would venture to guess that you could do much better than this. FWIW...
