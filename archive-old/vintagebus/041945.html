&gt; I didn't say that the aluminum would rub against the bearing, I said steel
&gt; would rub against aluminum. Steel flywheel. Aluminum (alloy) bearing. Write
&gt; 500 times on the blackboard &quot;I will read carefully before dissing other
&gt; students in class&quot;. 8^)

Aluminum against steel should be fine.  The crank is made of steel and it
rubs on the bearings just fine.  Now, the finish on the flywheel might not
be suitable for contact with the bearing 

&gt; &gt; Second, bearings almost always are made of dissimilar metals, so using the
&gt; &gt; shims as thrust bearings wouldn't work too well.  I doubt that they move
&gt; &gt; much relative to each other in operation.
&gt; 
&gt; You have lost me here. Dissimilar to what?

Dissimilar to each other.  If both of the parts of the bearing are made of
the same metal they will gall, since the metals will bond microscopically
and tear upon startup.

 Plain bearings are usually made
&gt; of a softer metal than the part that is moving in them so that the
&gt; relatively cheap bearings will wear out before the more expensive part. The
&gt; shims are a disposable part, but they can't be soft metal, the crank is
&gt; ideally not a throwaway. Flywheel-shim-shim-shim-thrust bearing. All parts
&gt; separated by a presumeably thin film of oil. The parts with the highest
&gt; friction will drive the parts with the lowest. I do not presume to know
&gt; where this will be,

It's pretty easy to figure out.  The shims have a larger surface areas and
are made of the same material, so they will have more friction between
them than the shim-to-crank interface.  Most of the motion will take place
at the thrust bearing.  As I recall, the thrust bearing is also grooved to
deliver oil to the thrust surface, which would also reduce friction here.

&gt; but I think it is safe to assume that the flywheel is
&gt; not spinning at 1000 rpm's while the shims are static. Or the shims spinning
&gt; at 1000 rpm's with the flywheel, etc. A Volkswagen engine with 15 - 20
&gt; pounds of oil pressure at idle isn't going to support a single shim flywheel
&gt; thrust system, nor is it set up to inject pressurized oil between the
&gt; surfaces. A Porsche with 50 psi at idle might be, though, I don't know.
&gt; Capillary action seems to be the oiling method in the VW. They only need to
&gt; maintain the oil film while the clutch pedal is depressed, once unloaded,
&gt; they just hang out and spin if they feel like it or not if they don't.

No, the oil is delivered to the grooves in the thrust bearing even at
relatively low pressure.  Once in the groove, it is pulled between the
shim and the bearing by hydrodynamic forces caused by the motion of the
bearing and the geometry of the groove.  This causes the shim to ride on
an oil film created by the wedging action of the shim and bearing.  The
shim-shim interfaces lack this groove, so the oil just isn't delivered
there.
