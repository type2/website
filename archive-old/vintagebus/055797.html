Subject: Re: [VB] Westy in Hot VWs

Just picked up the June issue today and want to add my congratulations to
both Robert and Kate Davis on their beautiful '59 Westfalia. The odds are
because of distance, I'll never see it in person. But the photographs
definitely show the amount of detail and hard work required to get it back
to original and beyond! Enjoy!

Love the vintage travel decals....

Scott
'67 Westy

  Congratulations to Robert Davis, his '59 Westy is in the
June issue of Hot VWs, page 76.  It looks fantastic!  I sure
hope we can meet at OCTO this year!  I still haven't started
the engine in my non-all-original '61 Westy but soon I hope!
Can't wait to park next to his so I can see what mine is
supposed to look like!
 Well done Robert,
   Lou &amp; Liz (in Havasu)
