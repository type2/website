&lt;&lt; any one out there with info need help ....
 going to see a 1969 transporter with sliding doors on both side need to know 
 how rare are they .
  thanks for any help 
  &gt;&gt;
commercial vehicles (trucks,panels,etc) are uncommon in the US as the tarriff 
was raised circa 1964, so you see more 63 panels than 73 panels.   This was 
to protect the domestic car manufacturers, and a VW panel become more 
expensive than many thought it was worth.
However, they were still made, just not sent here much.   Like the double 
door splitty panels, a double door bay panel is less common than one with 
door(s) on one side.  In WA state, there are more commercial than in, say, So 
Cal, because (I think ) they were brought from Canada, which had not made 
this extra tariff, and more were sold there.

So... it is pretty uncommon,  but not the &quot;rarest of the rare&quot;  Many people 
would think it's really pretty derrrn cool.  It would be worth more than your 
regular bay of than year.   DO check it out thoughroughly and make sure you 
don't get overwhelmed by the nifty model and ignore any potential problems it 
has.
