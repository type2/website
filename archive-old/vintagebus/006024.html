I went thru three leaking new ones until I found some old NOS ones last
summer at a swap meet.

&gt; Everett and All;
&gt;
&gt; You've seen my post about defective oil pressure switches.  I was
referring
&gt; only to the _functional_ defects.
&gt;
&gt; I didn't mention all the brand new oil pressure switches that leaked
THROUGH
&gt; the switch.  With these mutant pieces of trash the threads seal just fine
in
&gt; the case, but the oil seeps [sometimes even squirts] out of the innards of
&gt; the switch.
&gt;
&gt; This defect seems almost epidemic lately, and is not unique to a
particular
&gt; brand of switch.  A number of local shops and FLAPS have been cursed with
&gt; this problem, and the jury is still out on a source of reliably
functional,
&gt; non-leaking, oil pressure switches.
