I have a sign in my clinic that says I am interested in old VW busses. A
client came in today with a barndoor steering wheel and speedo, both pretty
crusty. Also included was a brand new 6v clock that does not appear to be a
bus item.  It is a beautiful NOS part, but have no idea what it is. VW part
number 311 919 201.
Any help out there?

Thanks,
