Subject: Re: [VB] Electrical help on 1/10th of a bus

You could just get a 6 or 12 volt battery and an on/off switch.  Unless you
plan on leaving the headlights on for a long time, it should be fine for a
while.  Just be careful where you put the battery.  Wouldn't want people to
be kicking it, that would hurt.  Good luck.

&gt; Sorry for minimal bus content, but here goes:
&gt;
&gt; I have made a Bus Wet bar and have it wired so that I can plug it into my
house. I need to know how I can run the headlights as well. If for no  other
reason than to get my friends to stop asking me if they work!
&gt;
&gt; I went to radio Shack and was told a 12v power converted would work
(1000ma?) it didn't. After a few seconds the lights dimmed and then went
out. I am not intersted in blinding people I just want them to glow a bit ,
sort of like a 12 volt headlight with a 6 volt battery.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas?
