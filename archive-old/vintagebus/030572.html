Subject: Wanted:

A few months ago someone on the list mailed me that they were replacing
a rear window section on their single cab (they are in San Diego).  They
said they did not need the small rear window glass and would be willing
to sell it.  If you're still on the list, would you please p-mail me I
lost your address?    Or if anyone out there has an extra (unscratched)
small truck or barn door rear window (they are the same) let me know.
Thanks!

I also need to know what size resistor I should use for my 6V wipers to
function properly on 12V.  I'm not going to bother with the two speed
switch right now.  Just want to get them going at a proper rate.

Thanks again.

Oh...almost forgot.  I REALLY need the LOWER 3 position 61/62 only seat
brackets.  Anyone out there have a 61/62 they are cutting up?  Rex???  I
really want to put this seat in before RB/Kelly its much cushier than
the broken down 1/3 2/3 someone put in.  Remember hunters take your
Makita and a spot weld cutter bit out with you to the next bone yard you
visit.  Finders fee waiting :-)

Steve
