&lt;&lt; Actually I only assumed there was one and since I haven't looked under
 the pedal pan I wasn't sure since I did not see it in the usuall spot.
 
 It's a 53
  &gt;&gt;
my 53 has no steering dampner, either, but I have a mind to install one.  I 
do have one of the pieces VW sold to attach one, but fabbing the rest would 
be no big deal I would not think, but pics would be nice, to see what they 
did to install them.  But it is low on my priority list, the stuff may be in 
a workshop manual.  
my bus gets the wiggles with certain bumps, steering to the side and the 
wiggle goes away.

I have some of those MOnroeshocks for the 53, but have not installed them yet 
(broke a bolt, dont like drilling, put it off) but you are saying you used 
the bushings out of the old shocks?  that would make things easy.
