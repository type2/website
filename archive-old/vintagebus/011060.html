Hi TJ,
Sounds like you might have a leaky axle seal.  It could be the spacer that 
the inner side of this seal rides on is worn too much or was rusty/rough 
enough to cause the inner seal lip too much friction.  Best when installing 
the seal and bearing cover with the inner spacer inside the seal all at the 
same time onto the lower axle  The cover the axle seal is installed in has a 
drain in it to divert any leakage/seepage from the seal itself to the inside 
of the brake backing plate just below the axle tube to avoid coating the 
brake shoes with the gear oil.  Eric&amp;Barb
