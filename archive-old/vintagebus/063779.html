Subject: Re: [VB] Be Prepared/ The Road to BNNTA

Some things just go without saying.  Always carry two belts under the
front seat with the stock jack.  Fire extinguisher right behind the
driver's seat.

The 290 (one-way) drive went without incident.  The weather in Missouri
was sunny, mid-80s and BNNTA had about 80 Type 2s, from 1961 to 2002. 
Susan-with-the-broken-alternator was there after her 3,200(?) mile trip
from Oregon in her bubble window.

At 9:00 Saturday night Bill Bowman assembled the crowd at a pavillion
for the &quot;awards&quot; and prizes.  He started off with several comments that
more Eurovans were present this year...perhaps they're becoming more
reasonably priced now that they're older(?).  Sheesh, sure puts a
perspective on our splits!

There's always a &quot;breakdown&quot; competition with stories of what the volks
went through to get to Missouri.  Either everyone is getting better at
maintaining their buses or there were a lot of people who didn't make
it.  This year's crop of breakdowns was tame.
