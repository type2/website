Subject: Door panel patterns

If something get's going i am just finishing up a
complete set of panels for my 61 DC.  Most of them
were traced from original panels.  I should have them
done this weekend.  If someone is going to collect and
post the information i can trace what i have and send
it off.

Thanks
m
