Subject: RE: [VB] pre-heat

Later 67s have the pre heat tube going from the aircleaner (on the right
side) directly back to the rear apron tin.  I have a picture of it on my
67 tipper web page.  Previous to that, the tube ran along the front of
the engine and down in the front on the left side.  Finding the tin
still with the clip for this style is semi difficult.

I'm not sure when the change date is... someone have a progressive
refinements sitting at their computer?
