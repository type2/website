Yeah, but at least the dove blue buses were various shades of
rust to kinda break up the visual monotony.

There's enuf BD deluxes in various stages of restoration that I'm sure
we'll see 4 or more in one place again.  Heck, there's at least
2 in Sacramento, a '54 and '55!  Then your '53 and '54; if we all showed 
up at KP with 'em there's 4 right there!  Get Ronnie to drive his '54
up to Sacramento...  Maybe Tom and Gary with their 51 and '52...

What I'd like to see is the 3 '55 deluxes in Sac all together: the
barndoor, the euro and the US bus - all lined up!

&gt; kombi's would you say&quot;Oh there 's just too much Dove Blue going on
&gt; here&quot;? You guys should of have been stoked that we got 4 barndoor
&gt; deluxe's together in one spot.Chance's are it will never happen again!!!
