Does anyone know if a Saphire I is correct for a 59/60 bus?  If not
what is?

Yesterday I was looking at my visors for my 23 window and noticed that
I only had the driver's visor.  I noticed that the holes for the
passenger's visor were not drilled.  Is it correct to only have one
visor for a 59/60 bus? Or were having two visors an option?
