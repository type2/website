 Someone on the list had a brake light decklid for sale.  You still out 
there? 
  
 
 Finaly took all the door panels out and wow!  Ok i found an old nudie pic of 
 some girl and on the back someone wrote something on it in 
 German....interesting.  Also found some newspaper scraps but are not legible 
 due to rotting.  Anyone know a really good way to clean the vinyl?  What 
 about cleaning and preserving the rear mat?  Thanks!

I found that giving them a good scrub with water and simple green helps.  If 
the vinyl is dry/cracked, after it is clean, get out a bottle of glycerin 
(available cheep at your local drug store) and give it a coat of glycerin.   
The OG front seat in my 53 that lived in the desert for 40 years is getting 
more supple every time I do this, also very nice on floor mats.  Veewee told 
me about the glycerin, it really works.
