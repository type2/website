Well, when I had rod knock it happened all of a sudden, and would go from
loud to quiet at different times. The best way that I know to check for
this, is to crank the engine and feel the case. It will probably have a
clunk feel to it (real nice terminology hunh?). If that doesn't detect it, I
usually take something metal, like a breaker bar or something else and
actually put it on the case and then put my ear to the breaker bar, the
sound will resonate through the metal, and sort of amplify the sound. I move
it around the engine until it's the loudest, and then you know about where
the sound is coming from. You said that everything seemed fine on the heads.
Well, I would rotate the engine by hand, and make sure that all of the
pushrods are moving, and that each valve is actually going down and not
stuck.  If you have a stuck valve, beat it with a rubber hammer. If all of
that moves correctly, with no problems, well, you know it's not the heads,
you know its not the lifters (and probably not the cam lobes), it's not
smoking so its probably not the rings (or pistons), so it's gotta be the
crank.

I hope this helps some

&gt; sorry folks...i left a few things out in the confusion...
&gt;
&gt; 1500 single port motor stuck in a 62 bus.  I just put in new pushrod
&gt; tubes and seals and just put the motor in last night...
&gt;
&gt; When I left buses nowhere near the arch...i first noticed this...
&gt; after starting the bus...and letting it warm up a tad... i would take
&gt; off... and in the top end of first and second gear mainly...it would get
&gt; to a certain point...and not want to accelerate any more in that gear...
&gt; like i put on the brakes or something as i was giving it gas.  i tried
&gt; to be nice to it and just upshift to lower the rpms...and this worked
&gt; for me all the way home from Missouri...after the motor was running for
&gt; a while... it was no problem.  this happened again this morning...as it
&gt; does every time after i start the bus up and drive it after its been
&gt; sitting a while...
&gt; just as i was getting to the upper end of 2nd gear...it gave out and
&gt; started making that knocking sound just as it didn't want to accelerate
&gt; any more in that gear..
&gt;
&gt; maybe this is of some help?
&gt;
