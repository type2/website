Hi All
I have 2 engines, both need parts, but it appears that I can make one out of
the 2.
What I'd like to know is if the parts are interchangable?
I have found some things that are strange to me,,, but may be quite normal
as I have little 40hp experience.
engine 1
serial# 5 021 722    appears to be 40 hp acorrding to Muir.  1960 era
what appears different is:
- Rockers and Oil pump is held on with bolts, not studs?
-the oil pump is very thick (the part outside the case)compared to any other
pump..like a high volume pump
-cylinder heads have a &quot;pocket&quot; or cavity near the intake port , under the
rocker cover
  heads have casting number 113 101 371 A
-pistons are 76.95mm and have &quot;Ind Brass&quot; on the underside, no VW marks
cylinders have yellow paint like a stock number but i can't read it.  I
assume that this is aftermarket pistons and cylinders.
this engine appears to be &quot;rebuilt&quot; as all bolts were loose, engine is
clean, tin is like new
but #1 exhaust valve is burned bad and #4 piston top has a chunk out of it
&gt;from the ring up
I havn't split the case yet, but the bottom end seems very good

engine 2
serial # 3 536 313  appears to be modified 36hp according to Muirs  1959 era
this engine appears more &quot;factory&quot; as everything has VW numbers
the head casting has 113 101 371 F
this engine needs 1 piston and cylinder and head, as it dropped a valve and
the valve head knocked the center out of the top of the piston,

What I was hoping to do was use the best bottom end and put the good pistons
and cylinders and heads on to it...
so, I was wondering if anyone knows if this is possible?
the heads differ in that one rocker bolts on the other has studs...it
appears that I can interchange the stud into the bolt holes  or i could have
the heads of engine 1 rebuilt?
the piston and cylinders appear the same so I should have 4 good ones
is there a good book that discribes this style engine

I am trying to put a budget engine together that I could put in my 62 Deluxe
most likely I will end up running a 1600 singleport instead, but I would
like to make a running engine out of these 2 if I could.
