&gt;Does anyone know what type and size tubing to replace this part? The
&gt;reservoir is just above the kick panel. The original appears to be made of
&gt;white plastic, and is now very hard and cracked where it enters the MC
&gt;reservoir. Any help?

i used a vinyl clear hose available at most hardware stores..i think it was 
1/4&quot; but it was a tight fit...i was worried it might disintegrate but it is 
fine after two years, and the old one was plastic anyways....the problem 
with my old one on the 71' was the rubber sleeves in the ends had 
disintegrated and all the fluid kept leaking out....
