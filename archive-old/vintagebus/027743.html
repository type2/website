Subject: 15&quot; bus rim

hey all,
while getting tires dismounted from rims the other day at the local tire
place ( I have a friend that works there...its nice!) I noticed that i
have a 15&quot; bus rim that has no hub cap clips.  Ok, thats not odd ;-) but
the rim didn't even have holes or anything for the rivet to go in.
There is nothing.  Hubcap clips were never put in the thing.  Its
exactly the same as the other 15&quot; bus rims that i have, but no hub cap
clips.  It does have 3 little dimples that seem like they might hold a
hub cap on (like the late bay-vanagon rims do) but thats all.  Is this
an early thing rim or some off the wall bus rim?/  Like I said...its the
same as my other bus rims....

thanks,
