Subject: panel fs in the eugene/springfield  OR. area
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

On they way to work today I noticed that a local junk man had found a 64-66 
panel and drug it up to his shop. I stopped and asked the price but the man 
who decides wasn't in and hadn't seen it yet. Its pretty rough. all primer 
and looks like it has a bit of bondo in it. motor was out but in the back. 
one wheel was off the front but also in the back. make a good work rig. Its 
at the fenced lot beside the exxon station  over by LCC. Sorry I dont have a 
phone number.
