Well today I finally broke down and bought my one and only project....
Its a 1960... 23 window bus... Primer colored :) Needs a bit of body and
metal work.. But a sweet straight nose... The Engine ... brakes..
tranny.. and redux boxes have been redone... Interior is in peices but
has all the bits and pieces as well as the deluxe chrome... Will need
quite a bit of work but will be worth it when finished.... Thanks for the
help from this list in finding my project and thanks to Jerry as well...
Hope to get some pics of it up soon... 

Greg
