I don't really mind driving in an un-air-conditioned car, even in
100++ temperatures.  What I really hate is getting into modern &quot;solar
collector&quot; car with excellent insulation, perfect sealing, and nuclear air
conditioning.

You get into the car which has been heated by 'ol sol to 180F.  You fire
it up, and the air conditioning computer uses its four brain cells to
figure out that it's danged hot in the car.  

The computer turns the AC on
to maximum setting, but since the evaporator isn't cooled down yet, what
the passengers get is a 180F blast of air blown in their faces.

The compressor kicks in, and the 180F blast suddenly becomes a 20F blast,
giving the front seat passengers a nice ice cream headache.

Now, the AC is working its hardest, but the laws of heat transfer prevail,
requiring several minutes to get the interior cooled off.

Of course, by this time the vehicle has reached its destination, allowing
the passengers to emerge from the 72F (exactly) car back into the 110F
atmosphere.

Then the car is parked in the sun again, and the process repeats.

Why do people put themselves through this temperature roller-coaster?  It
certainly can't be healthy to put ourselves through so many changes so
fast.

Much better to have a vehicle that doesn't gain so much heat when parked
and which has excellent ventalation when under way.  If you then want to
add AC to make it more comfortable on long trips, so much the better.
