&gt;Are the drive train in split buses the same as pre 67 beetles?

The engine is the same.  The Bus transmission may have slightly
different gear ratios but the important difference is that the
ring gear goes &quot;the other way&quot; (there are two ways it can go) on 
a Bus transmission.  If you stick a stock Bug transmission in
a stock split Bus, you will have four reverse gears.  The Bus
has the reduction gear boxes at each rear wheel which the Beetle
did not have--or at least the civilian Beetles did not have.

&gt;and, what is the best way to paint a motor, ie, so it wont fade 
&gt;quickly due to heat, ect. 

A guy I know locally says he likes the &quot;aluminum&quot; (silver) hi-temp
spray can paint for cases.  I've never painted a case, but I'd
be inclined just to clean *ALL* the gunk off it really well and
leave it bare.

Good luck!
