Thom, I have had both a repop and an original manual
which came with my 42K original mile `67.  I recall
there was something on the cover of the original
manual that was deleted or omitted on the repop?  I
can't 100% recall but I remeber the repop said &quot;SO 24&quot;
real big then the top right read &quot;Instruction manual&quot;
and that was it.  If I recall the original said the
date of model it was for or something also addes under
the SO42?  But positive the repop had nothing there.  

I sold the 42K mile westy to a fella named &quot;Dave
McKinney&quot; in dayton Ohio.  He is on the net, not sure
of his email off hand but I know he has a `54 panel
van..it is the &quot;Tom's Candy&quot; bus.  It is listed and
pictured on either your site or Ev's under Barn
doors....it also has Dave's email there.  Contact him
and ask about the manual he is a realllly nice
guy...and he can set the record straight on what the
cover should say on the real McCoy.

&gt; How would I be able to tell if a particular SO42
&gt; camper manual is
&gt; NOS as claimed or repro.  I've been informed that
&gt; there was a run
&gt; of repops by someone in washington, but the one
&gt; being presented to
&gt; me is being touted as NOS, but it's in super-duper
&gt; spiffy condition,
&gt; ie no traces of aging.  Any clues?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
