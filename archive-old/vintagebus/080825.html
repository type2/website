Subject: Freedom Camper Interior

My '67 is a &quot;Freedom Camper&quot;, although the interior was pretty intensely 
modified by the 2nd owner (i'm the 3rd).

I've been curious about what the original interior looks like, and I came 
across this while searching:

http://www.oldcars.co.jp/vw/65hig.html

(clickon on the &quot;???&quot; links for interior pics)

From the bits that I have, I know that it's not what my originial looked 
like, but it's interesting and provides food for thought for those 
designing their own interiors.

cheers,
   tom
