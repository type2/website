most areas have welding shops with pro welders that do piece work and are
definitely professional enough to more than handle the job. make a few calls and
talk with these people. the simple rules i have used in previous situations is
if a person will talk to you as a layman and shows interest you usually can get
high quality work for a reasonable price.you don't have to use a bodyman or
bodyshop good welders don't do bodywork just ask the metalwizard.
