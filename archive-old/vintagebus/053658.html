&gt; The issue is trade mark law - not vw.  The fact is if you don't
&gt; protect your trade mark you lose it.  If vw isn't diligent in protecting
its
&gt; trademark it will become part of the public domain and anyone will be able
to use it.
&gt; Your problem is with the law of intellectual property your efforts will be
&gt; better spent complaining to law makers.


This is true.  By federal law, if you don't protect your trademark you lose
it, so your issue is really with the legislature, not VW.
In my recent foray into Fiat land (having traded a used Bus engine for a '76
Spider convertible - boy is that car fun to drive!), I learned that VW is
not alone in their diligence.  Recently Fiat forced a parts specialist in
the U.S. to remove the word &quot;Fiat&quot; from their business name on the grounds
of trademark infringement - this despite the fact that Fiat pulled out of
the U.S. market for 17 years ago!!  I suppose they want to keep that
trademark safe just in case there is a sudden groundswell of demand in the
U.S. for notoriously unreliable Italain motor vehicles. :-)
