&gt; Hello.
&gt;
&gt; I noticed this weekend that my accel cable was slicing through my tranny
&gt; near a top left bolt.  Is there or should there be a tube or pulley that
&gt; places the cable away from the tranny?

We had a discussion about this recently.  Some advocate putting a piece of
fuel line over the cable, others say to put it in a bowden tube like is
done on other models.
