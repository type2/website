Subject: Re: [VB] Anyone know of any serious rat look buses?

Would you check-out that black satin paint,  way too cool!

I'm going to do my bug that way when I paint it.

&gt;At present I'm leaning more and more toward the
&gt;rat-look angle with my Australian '67 panel.

I think there is 2 definitions of the rat look. The traditional rat look l 
think is basically like finding a bus that's been in a barn and getting it 
mechanically sound, but leaving it alone cosmetically. Many times lowered 
or raked.

The more current use of the term is used more loosely and seems to be used 
a lot for cars that are more along the lines of a &quot;volks-rod&quot;. There's a 
whole website related to these vehicles here: http://www.volksrods_dot_com/
