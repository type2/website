Subject: Louvered sundial windows?

Does anyone know if you can still find replacement glass for the louvered
windows on a Sundial.  Went up the coast for a nice drive with the wife and
some friends last night and when one of em opened a window they dropped 1 of
my windows out!!! :(  Most of my glass is getting all seperated and yellowed
out so this is a good time for me to start the window project i guess.
I do have a spare complete window assembly but the safety glass is really
seperated on it too.
