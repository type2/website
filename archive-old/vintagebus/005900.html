I too had a good experience with KYMCO. I purchased a super
header and when I went to install, the left hand flange was
rotated and little did not fit over the exhaust studs. I
called and spoke with Ronnie in the afternoon and he said he
had one other left and would hold it until the next morning
for me.  Sure enough I went down the next morning for a no
hassle exchange. We even checked the new unit on a long
block in the shop and checked the defective unit just to be
sure.

Chris.
