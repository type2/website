&gt; We want to drive from Charlotte NC to SO Cal, and back. Anyone have ideas 
&gt; for routes and things to see on the way??  Should I go low through the 
&gt; Desert or high through the Plains?

Hi Bryan,
Do both routes!  One on the way out, and the other on the way back.  Make 
sure to check out Meteor Crater, Carlsbad Cavern, plus the museum in Boron CA 
near Edwards AFB, and we have heard that seeing the VLA (As everyone has seen 
in the movie &quot;Contact&quot;) is worth it on your desert route.  Late spring after 
the rains turn loose the green and flowers and before the seasonal weather 
heats up is the best time for either/both routes.
