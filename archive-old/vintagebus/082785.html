Subject: Re: [VB] rear axle seal replacement

&gt;&gt;  I just replaced my rear axle seal and the seal kit I got had 2 of the 
square  paper gaskets.  I only used one and for a few days after replacing the  
seal, I noticed very slight leakage from the real axle seal.  Did I do  
something wrong/bad by only using one of the paper  gaskets?&lt;&lt;
Hi Coerver,
Depends!!  Did you take off the brake backing plate?  If so, one  of the 
square paper gaskets goes there between the backing plate and the axle  tube.  
Very slight leakage could be due to the seal seating onto the inner  spacer.  If 
it continues for more than a month then we would take it apart  again and 
inspect for the cause.

&gt;&gt;BTW: I used a floor jack and a breaker bar to loosen the 46mm  axle nut... 
works great &lt;&lt;
 
Just do not retorque that way!!!!
