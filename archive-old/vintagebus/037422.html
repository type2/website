I'm thinking of putting safaris in my 54 Single Cab.  Is anyone familiar
with the repros that I've heard are out there for a barndoor? If so, what do
you think of them?   Is it better to hold out and search for an original VW
set of barndoor safaris?

don't know about the repro BD safaris, but what I hear the reg safari repros
are not up to the snuff of the original, vast improvements not withstanding,
and no reports to cntradict this so far.     However, safaris are the sort of
thing you want in a hot,dry climate.  And of course, the bd buses have poor
ventilation, not having the roof vent (except a few have added vent systems,
like mine :) sorry couldn't resist).  at least your 54 doesn't have those
piano hinge vent wings, which from what i hear don't ventilate worth beans
(quote from Jerome from a 52 driver &quot;They suck&quot;).   But if this is a bus you
aren't going to drive in the rain (safaris leak.  Period. ) and will garage,
then that's a certain amount of worry s gone.

Personally, I would not put safaris in any bus.    And seems like all the show
buses have them, so why not be different.  I took them out of my camper (then
again, I live in the PNW, and it is a dailiy driver), but still have them in
my 61, and they are nice when it's warm out.  Though noisy with the wind.
And leak.   Will switch them out soon, as fall gets wet.

Saw a (one) original barndoor safari for sale.  Set up a bit different than
the later ones- have a couple tabs up top, not a long piano hinge if a recall
correctly.
