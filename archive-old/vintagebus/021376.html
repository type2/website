Subject: Re:  [VB] roof rack clamps.
To: NickAragon_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

well today i picked up a 7' roof rack for my bus
at the marin show but the only down fall it only had one clamp. dose anyone 
know a shop that sells or remanufacturesbus clamps.

p.s how was the rest of the show i left at about noon i didnt feel like 
lugging around the rack the rest of the show.
 --  - -
different racks used iffernt clamps.
 
One can buy turnbuckles from the hardware store, grind one hook flat to tuck 
under the rain gutter, and attach to bus (hose clamp to rack leg).  people do 
make clamps though (who?)
