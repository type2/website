&gt;To bring it back to VWs, I have driven around witth Chrome in the bus, not 
a  lot, but occasionally, and she seems to be getting
&gt;more used to it.  She  likes to walk around on the back of the front bench 
seat and look out the  windows.    Or bounce into the
&gt;back and look out the back window.  
&gt;just letting youse know

My cat Spazzchild loves my buses and can be found in there whenever I'm 
working on them. Many times I find myself a few 
blocks away on a testride when I find him jumping into my lap. One time I 
stopped at a red light and heard some very loud
meowing coming from the back of the bus. I ran back and opened the engine 
compartment, and Spazz went flying out into traffic
I chased him and grabbed him and brought him home. The only thing happened, 
he got a spot of dirt on his nose. Thought it 
would learn him to stay out of there, but he still tried to jump in when I'm 
not looking.
