&gt;Some outrageous prices for people thinking they have something important.
&gt;i.e. 1963 23 window for ten grand.  Rusted out belly pans, needs pass.
rocker,
&gt;full interior needed, but complete, needs paint, body work, and a complete
&gt;resto job.

Or the freshly painted 23-window that needed assembly and interior for $18k!

There were lots of second-quality bus parts.  Lots of doors, aprons, engine
lids, etc, but all with dents and scratches, rust and sawzall enhancements.
 I think everyone is digging deep to make that next buck. Saw a '57 engine
lid (flat, but no brake light) for $150, warped to hell.

I bought a set of NOS semaphores, NOS wheel cylinders, and some various
odds n ends.  Went home early, like 11
