Back in my 356 Porsche days we used to have the drums relined, Porsche had
aluminum drums with steel liners and finding these NOS or even used 15 years
ago was a challange so the only option was relining them, 15 years ago it
was $100.00 per drum, lined, turned and trued. The only problem was that in
extreme use the linings would start to move in the drum!

ps. the price of new pre 67 drums (german) will be coming down in the future
as more vendors recieve them, including the 62 and earlier.

When I think about it I think, hey I run 1600 engines, parts are easy to
get.  I run small-nut drums.  How easy are they to get nowdays? This
brings me to a question I had been thinking about lately.  Would it be
possible to build up the worn away surface inside the drum by some
electro-spray type process and then re-turn the drums?  
Right now I guess you can get NOS drums for $150 which might be cheaper
than the above, but I was thinking what to do if you couldn't get drums at
all.
