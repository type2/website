The problem is in shipping onesy-twosey stuff.  From talking to him
on the phone, he seems to be set up better for fab than for retail.  It's
easier for him to send a big package of stuff to one place than a bazillion
little packages.  Yes, it would be ideal if he had a nice online system, but
it doesn't look like he's there yet.
