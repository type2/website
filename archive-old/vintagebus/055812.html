Subject: Re: [VB] Steering box

&gt; This knowledge is gleaned from years of reading
&gt; procedures, and I hope it's clear.  Now, wasn't
&gt; Wolfsburg West offering a kit with a shaft with worm
&gt; gear, sector piece w/ bearings and other little pieces
&gt; in their catalog a while back?  Or was it the TRW
&gt; incorrect stuff?  I was planning on trying to use it
&gt; to fix a box, but never saw it for sale.

Yeah, WW has a rebuild kit. $175.00 and its out of stock (wonder why?). Who
would anyone buy a rebuild kit for $175.00 when you can get a rebuilt one
for $200?
