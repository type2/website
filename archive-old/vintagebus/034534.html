&lt;&lt; Also, ALWAYS replace the shoes on both sides, otherwise they will never
stop evenly. This is the voice of experience speaking. HTH &gt;&gt;
Hi Craig,
If you have really good brake shoes on one side and the other side needs
replacing for some strange reason.  Then take off one of the shoes from the
good side to install it on the other brake backing plate.  This allows the
installation of one new shoe per each side.  This will prevent the problem of
having the steering pull to one side due to differant hardnesses of brake
shoes.  This way you have a emergency set of new shoes or at a later time you
can match another particial set of shoes in the same way to make a compleat
set.
