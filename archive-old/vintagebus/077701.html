Subject: Re: [VB] Re:RGBox bolts &amp; thunks

having the lone RGBbolt broken is the worst one.  If you can see marks where it worn from moving it was thunking.  If a bolt was loose and one was missing it was thunking.   

A guy came over in his bus to my house, and he complained his bus thunked.  2 RGB bolts were broken or loose, or was it 2 broken 2 loose.   Fortunately for him it was covered under warranty by the guys who installed the rebuildt tranny, who for some dufus reason put in inserts and *smaller* bolts.  I convinced him to get the AAA to tow his bus to the shop rather than drive it.   I didn't feel safe driving in the driveway.  d%mn wheel will fall off.  thunk thunk.

Anyway, you can take a bolt out, and go (in another vehicle) to a hardware store and buy a new one with same threads, pitch, diameter.   And get those new split washers.

you can always jack up the bus, and physically lift the wheel or RGBox up/down to see if it moves/ thunks. 

I am not saying that you dont have fulcrum plate wear (daisy wheel aka kaiser sphere area in the tranny) which causes a thunk as well but at least get the RGBs bolted on right.  Did you do the test I said when you first mentioned the thunk, about spinning the rear wheel with it off the ground, listening for the thunk? 

Dont believe me or your mechanic.  check for yourself.  read the books.  come to terms with your ass (vw), for it bears you. Read Muir's font of wisdom. and bentley's.   The good mechanic will appreciate it, as what he says will make more sense.

Eric&amp;Barb will tell you to drill the hole deeper and tap it so you can use a longer bolt.

&gt; Correction to my own post.  The broken bolt is on the drivers side.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone agree with my mechanic that the broken and loose bolts would cause
&gt; the CLUNKING noise that I have been looking for for months now ?  Or do I
&gt; believe TMFH that the noise comes from the &quot;flower&quot; in the 
&gt; axel ?  Diane
