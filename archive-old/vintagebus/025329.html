&gt; Just to note, my '66 westy has the sticker to the left of the
&gt; steering column that says &quot;12 volt&quot; with the lightening bolt.  Of
&gt; course Ive seen these as reproduction, but knowing some of the
&gt; history of this bus, I believe this '66 was  a 12v  from birth.  Was
&gt; this an option, or did they get an early start with mine?  Maybe I
&gt; have the very first 12v bus in the world.  Talk about &quot;rare&quot; ;)

As you can see in my mail I am talking about 12 V as STANDARD EQUIPMENT.

It also was a common option in earlier years.

It became widely spread in about 1961, but 12 V were available upon
special request even earlier (without M code).
