Just as I figgered.  Now I have to carry BOTH the
Sermons along with the Split Screen Guide with
me so I can peruse them both at home and work,
as the need necessitates, or as the mood swings.

Like this would be a problem . . . . .;-)

My order went into the mail this morning. 

BTW, thanks for the combo Mac and that 
'other' system format.
