I've got some kind of bay-window middle seat in my '67, held down with a
somewhat random assortment of clamps, carriage-like bolts, and wingnuts.
The later seat matches up to the slots/holes in the floor of the '67.  The
correct clamps/bolts/wingnuts are a little hard to find.  It takes about 10
minutes
of crawling around on the floor to install or remove the middle seat.  My
setup is not ideal.  When the seat's in, I have my carpet rolled up on the
floor behind it.  When the seat's out, the seatbelts are lying there on the
floor.  I have a folding bed from a Westy in the back.  There's not a whole
lot of legroom between the back seat and the middle seat, but I have found
that the back seat is still the most comfortable ride in the bus.  Big,
cushy seat and a lot less bounce than up front.

I'd like to find a correct middle seat for my '67, but not for $3k.

    -Carl

&gt;
&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I would appreciate your thoughts on this:
&gt;
&gt; I am getting two bench seats from a '71 for my '65--the middle and rear
&gt; seats.  I really really need the rear seat, and would ultimately like the
&gt; middle seat if there's a reasonable way to make it removable (by me) when
&gt; I need it, or don't.
&gt;
&gt; Can this be done?  How?
&gt;
&gt; Also--this guy is going to have the bus towed after I get what I want from
&gt; it.  Now, this is a limited offer, because I am a single mom with limited
&gt; tools and $ to ship; BUT, in appreciation for all the advice I get here,
&gt; if you have a small, obscure, or hard to get part that I could possiblilty
&gt; remove and send, email me and I will TRY to accommodate.
&gt;
&gt; Aloha,
&gt; Roberta
&gt;
