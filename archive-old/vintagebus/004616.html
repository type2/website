Ok, My friend is (finally) getting his bus together but he has come across
some problem that we can not figure out.
#1 It won't start everytime.It used to start everytime up until last week,
now starts about once every 20 tries. Didn't start at all today. Starter
just clicks. Reads 12.5volts at the battery, we cleaned the terminals and
the ground point. So we figure it is the starter (which is probably bad but
this isn't the problem) So we push start it so he can drive it home from the
paint guy's house. Check the voltage coming from the generator (at idle it
reads -10volts)He blames the negative reading on his voltmeter acting up.
Runs fine so he drives it home (10 miles?) Doesn't make it home. It seems
the generator isn't charging the battery, which is strange because last week
we drove it to a show (maybe 5 miles away at night with the lights on) with
no problems starting or driving. The PO had taken the bus apart for paint
and labeled all the wires (some incorrectly) and after the show he was
poking around and noticed the generator was wired backwards (so he thought)
so he switched them. Is it possible that the generator is now wired
backwards and that is keeping it from charging? Would that affect the
starter too?
Q#2
Passenger side taillight will not come on. Power is going to both terminals,
we assume the housing isn't grounding so he runs a wire to a good ground,
still nothing. Bulb is good, put it in the other side to check. Am I missing
something, I've tried using some aluminum foil in the socket to make sure it
grounds, nothing. Lost on that one too. He wanted me to ask before we tow it
to Jeff's Bug Shop (he's pricey but he's been doing it for 30+ years)
Thanks,
Brian
