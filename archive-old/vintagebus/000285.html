&lt;&lt;  Is the alternator THAT much better??? &gt;&gt;
Hi Mark,
It depends on how much wattage used over how much time while camping, and how 
many miles of driving between, how many batteries in your camper, and what 
type and size of batteries to really figure out if an alternator would be 
absolutely nessasary for you.  We have had friends go to alternator to find 
they are more likely to burn out due to wiring problems/mistakes, but if you 
make sure your wiring is in good condition that should most likely not be a 
problem.  Also the alternator requires a special fuel pump which you can not 
rebuild, a special shorter fuel pump push rod, alternator stand and probably 
the fanshroud to alternator tin.    Eric&amp;Barb
