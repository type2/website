:  the 12V...it lets me run nice things like a tape deck and radio and hook up 

FWIW, I'm quite happy with the classical stations that the stock radio
picks up, so that factor never would have occurred to me.  Somehow,
classical seems appropriate for a solid 1960 bus with (relatively)
conservative paint job.  When I had the '66 Gerbil, with a painting-
party personalized paint job, surf music was definitely more in order.

:  it also allows me to run a 6V starter at mach 3.

This is the one real advantage I'd give to going to twelve volts.
It'll always start *right* up.

:  I don't think that 6V parts are really harder to come across...its just that
:  they are different.

And not available at Checker, Pep Boys, Autozone, and the other
big-chain, no-brain supply houses.  Figure on mail-order or seeking
out slightly more-specialized suppliers.  NAPA and Carquest usually do
me pretty well (the latter has actually had correct esoteric bus parts
in stock, like windshield wiper blades and a cap for an 010
distributor).

:  necessary.  6V is original to some buses... but its your bus, right?

And that last point is, of course, the most important.  What do *you*
want in your bus?  Whatever it is, that's what should be there.
