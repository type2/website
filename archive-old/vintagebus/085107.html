Subject: Funky Green parts coming soon to Metwiz_dot_com

As many of you know Ronnie of Type2parts_dot_com (aka Splitpile) and I have been
working with Gerson to get his split bus parts to the states, well Ronnie
has already received a couple orders I think and I just placed one today and
it should be arriving in about 2 weeks or so. I plan on having another order
ready by the time that one ships. 

As many of you know I said when I found better parts than mine I would use
them, well I have found them so I have shut down my parts fabricating and
will be handling his. I'll handle  east of the Mississippi and Ronnie is
handling west of there. Here's the link to my add on the samba.

We're still working on a lot of the logistics and such so bear with us. Our
goal is to get you the best possible parts for your money.  Thanks
