 &gt; As for the &quot;not needed&quot; part: sure, it'll run fine without them.  But your
 &gt; cooling will be erratic and will cause the engine to take longer to warm 
up,
 &gt; never warm up all the way, cool the wrong parts, etc.  At the least you
 &gt; probably aren't going to see the same durability that you see in an engine
 &gt; with a properly functioning thermostat assembly.
 
 Speaking of this what's the proper heat range.  My 71 1600 DP ran 180-210, 
though
 I don't think it ever got above 75 the whole time.  What's the upper limit?

From what I understand the oil loses its lubricating properties about 235*F 
(or is it 225*F?) So I dont want to be there.   I figure 170 to 210 is fine 
and dandy.  higher than 210 and I'm keeping an eye on the guage and /or 
driving at lower rpms. (as 2600-2800 seems the optimal cooling, but generally 
I drive faster than that)  If the temp climbs above 210 at all, the motor 
gets an early oil change.  And that oil often as not that had got hot has an 
inconsistant consistancy, not all one uniform , but has gloppiness to it.  I 
don't think that is good.

As the cooling system is the heating system, it is interesting that about 
anything I have done to make better cooling has also made better heating.   
Like engine seals everywhere, thermostat, etc etc.
