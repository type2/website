Hi Everybody,

Another lurker is revealed - I've been reading the list for a few 
months now, and think I've just about got the hang of it. It's a great 
resource, hope I can contribute in the future.....

Back to the plot - I've owned a '66 standard microbus for over three 
years now, which has been previously modified (well covered by the 
alternative M-codes!) Using this bus has given me a serious addiction 
though, and I've been on the lookout for an original van to satisfy my 
cravings. I think I've found it - I'm looking at it for a second time 
this weekend, but I'm virtually certain this is the one (I get 
palpitations every time I see it, and I can't sleep for thinking about 
it - surely that says something!)

It's a 1956 Westy (Kombi - model 231) with small flip-top and camping 
box interior. Chassis no. 175 639, body no. 168 289. Engine is not 
original, but I think it is the right year (engine no. 1 759 962 - 
original engine no. 376 783(?) ) It's a US export model (originally 
shipped to Portland) - it's strange for us here in the UK to see bullet 
indicators on such an early bus, and it has the two round reflectors 
below the rear lights. I seem to remember that the rear lights are the 
domed barndoor type (they look almost black), rather than the flat '55 
style ones, but I'd have to check these again to be sure.

The interior is in good condition for it's age - has a large and small 
table hinged from the seat bulkhead, sprung metal framed bed (pulls out 
into double), storage space below this and along the engine bulkhead. 
The rubber mat on the floor above the engine has four mounting points 
on it - the seller (who is knowledgeable and has alot of history for 
the van) thinks these may have bnen for a roll-back bread box style 
cabinet (as described in Susan Crandall's excellent article in the Type 
2 library) I guess these cabinets are quite rare...... along with 
literature relating to the Westy interiors of this period. If anyone 
has any further information or thoughts, I'd really appreciate them. 
All interior panels are there, apart from the rear headliner, which 
rotted out due to leaks from the hatch (evidence of these on the wooden 
bows) I've searched the archives for the baltic birch threads, so I've 
got plenty of info relating to putting one of these back.

There are no poles/canvas (awning)/roofrack with the van - so I guess a 
long (and expensive!) search may be ahead if these items are to 
added....

If anyone can supply any additional information, or point me to things 
I've missed, relating to the camping box interiors, I'd be very 
grateful. Early Westys are rare beasts over here. Thanks to those 
people who host Westy web sites, I've picked up alot of info from these.

Apolgies for the long first posting, and thanks in advance for any help.

Steve Carrington
