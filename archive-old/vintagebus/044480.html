Out here in Southern California with expensive land, expensive power, and 
high labor costs the &quot;norm&quot; is about 35-40$ per hour for body work/metal 
replacement.
Should be cheaper way the hell out in the middle of nowhere.
What does metwiz charge? I thought is was less than that...

&lt;&lt; I stopped by the only VW restoration shop in these parts (Minnesota)
yesterday, to see of he had anything interesting for sale, as I'm in the
market for a '68-'70 Beetle.  I saw about six cars marked SOLD, including a
somewhat rough but rust free '68, which was claimed to have gone for $3,500.

Anyway, in his 'showroom' was a freshly painted '67 21 window.  It was a
rolling bare shell, painted inside and out, original blue/white colors.  I
was sighting down the sides and boy was that sucker straight.  Probably
straighter and shinier than when new.  Just then the owner approached, and
I half jokingly asked &quot;Did you replace the rockers in this one?&quot;, and he
said &quot;yeah, both rockers, the rear corners, one dogleg, the outer floor
inside the side doors, and the lower pillars.  Look inside and you can see
the seams.&quot;

Sure enough.

&quot;I could have made the inside look like original too, but this is a driver,
and those places will be covered up anyway.&quot;

OK, so the guy does good work.  Even the seams which are supposed to show
on the outside were perfect.  Now to talk turkey, as I have a '66 Westy in
need of rockers.  Last fall this guy had quoted me $600 per side to do my
rockers.

Me:  &quot;How much do you get to do rockers in a bus?&quot;

Him:  &quot;Including paint?&quot;

Me:  &quot;No, just the body work.&quot;

Him:  &quot;$1200 per side&quot;

Me:  &quot;You know, that's double what you quoted me last year.  Business must
be pretty good.&quot;

Him:  &quot;Well it all depends on what you need.  Most will need crossmembers
underneath, lower pillers, etc.  Anyway, it's $75 per hour.&quot;
