Subject: 1961 owner's manual

I finished reading my 1961 Transporter owner's manual last night!! Wow, how
enlightening!!! It is amazing how much the manual tells you how to do! I
figured out exactly how the original air cleaner hooked up and exactly where
the preheater intake air to the aircleaner came from. It is connected to the
stale air heaterbox on the left side of in the front of the engine behind
the fan shroud.

I have a pull out knob below the front seat next to the heater control knob,
to the right of it. It wasn't described in the manual. Does anyone know what
this is for?

I got a weighted flap control valve for my air cleaner and now have
installed it. It seems to function ok. It was very difficult to get the
little plastic rings in place without breaking them. I had to shave off a
small piece of one of them, but finally got it in. Now I will route the
preheated air from an opening in the breast plate on my later model motor
somrthing like in a mid-60's bus.

I also found the triangle piece to mount the air cleaner elbow to the fan
shroud but since my fan shroud is a later model it doesn't quite fit,
bummer!
