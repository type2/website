Subject: Tire info on &quot;My Classic Car&quot;
Mime-Version: 1.0

I see a lot of discussion here about different types of tires with regards
to what came on a bus and what's available now and what's best and so on. I
just saw that next Sunday's episode of &quot;My Classic Car&quot; at 12:30 pm on TNN
is gonna have info on the differences between antique tires and modern
ones. Don't know how good it'll be, but thought I'd mention it for you tire
junkies.

Anyone know if they ever featured a vw on that show? I always see the old
american cars on there. It IS TNN...so I guess that could be why. ;)
