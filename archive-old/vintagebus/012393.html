I got a front seat cover from west coast, and it's very nice.  I imagine
their interior panels would be of similar quality.  It's better than
TMI and SewFine put together.

But it's also twice as spendy...

&gt; interior panels for a 1967 walkthrough bus? I have been restoring this for
&gt; eight months,  I just got done painting it, and now it's time to put it all
&gt; back together.I have found prices to vary greatly. Has anybody purchased
&gt; TMI panels or Westcoast classic restoration? Any input would be
&gt; appreciated.  Jim
