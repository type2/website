48 hours and the road trip begins, seven buses and a camaro!!!!!
hope not don't like no stinking water pumper following me
see you all in JEROME.

welcome back BOB good to hear some good words of wisdom
again, some people just don't understand, overlook the attitude
and look at the wisdom, if it helps use it, if it don't ignore
it, some people listen to me and some don't but thats life, 
but my vw's all run good and last, just try to pass on what i've learned, both from trial and error and listening to what people
say. no flames here.
