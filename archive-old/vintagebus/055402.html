Subject: cool tins

Hi, All...
While putting together the engine for my 65 bus, I decided to
install a set of bugpack T3 &quot;cool tins&quot;. As I have never installed
a set before, I have come to this realization...neither the rear
deflectors nor the front(lower) deflectors will fit with this tin in
place. 
So...do I take a BFH and &quot;modify&quot; the front and rear deflectors,
leave them out, or ???.   For what it's worth, I also intent to use
stock thermostat and shutters.
Help!!
DUCK
&lt;...thinking..it sounded like a good idea at the time...&gt;
