Subject: Re: [VB] VIRUS

I'll suggest a couple of *free* solutions to the problem.=20
For a virus scanner got to www.grisoft_dot_com and download AVG and install.=20=

For a better and much more virus proof e-mail program go to www.eudora_dot_com=
=20
and replace your Micros**t Outlook with their basic or sponsored =
versions.=20

Ditto that for me.  I have been sent the worm/virus 4 times now.  No one =
has
said anything about getting bad mail from me yet but it could happen.
Unless I send you an Email telling you I'll be sending you an Email with =
an
attachment with an Email, don't open it.
