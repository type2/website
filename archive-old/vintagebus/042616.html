&gt; Yeah, we just bought one for $21 and change for our 65, but I think what E&amp;B

&gt; cost. Also the guy is putting 67 beam/tranny in his 61 so he needs the dual

&gt; 
&gt; Right?
actually,

im the guy lookign to put a 67 beam and tranny in a 61.  This guy just
needed a new master cylinder for a 61 kombi, and wanted to use a spare 67
one to do it.

FWIW i've been told that the MC attached to the body, not the beam so
wether one used a 67 or 6? front beam, the MC and brake lines would be
mounted as the shell requires, not the beam.

on my 67/61 swap, to simplify pullign parts can i just swap everything
&gt;from the arms out from teh 67 to 61, or are the front beams different ID's
in the bore?

thanks,

Steve
