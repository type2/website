Subject: Busses in the Shop
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi everyone,
The first busses by the shop was a great turnout. 
There was some great busses that I hadn't seen before. The nice 50 panel of 
Ray's that he's had for a long time and looks to be a nice long-term project. 
The double door euro inside the shop, an early panel with the swivel seat 
option (what a great bus that is).Volks Authority is an awesome shop and very 
clean. I haven't been to one that nicely set-up in a long time. 
In the parking lot was a few trucks, some deluxes along with my 63 hardtop 
deluxe, panels, hatchtop camper, and a great mix of cool busses. Most were 
drivers, some projects, and others restored.
The rarity of some of the cars on display was great to see away from some of 
the big shows. The people were great to hang out with and talk to. I 
definately will keep coming to this event in the future.

On the way home we decided to stop in Pleasanton which was the host to the 
West Coast National hot rod show and we walked around downtown and saw a few 
splittys and was wondering if anyone recognized them.
The first was a dead mint 64 or 65 Dove Blue Westy pop-top, bench front seat, 
Westy slanted rack, bosche fog lights up front, and a mint cabinet set 
inside. If anyone knows the owner of this one, tell them they have a sweet 
bus.
The second was another Dove Blue bus, but this one was an early crew cab with 
a set of homemade hoops. Looked ok, but definately did the job.
Hope everyone else had a great weekend.
