Subject: a miserable morning

So... I drive a 1966 Westfalia on a daily basis, have for the past few years
now.  Yesterday my boyfriend convinced me to park my bus in his underground
parking lot.  I'd always thought the van was too high, as it has a roof rack
and generally I carry my spare tire on the roofrack, making it pretty tall.
But we found I could just fit under the door with about 2 inches of
clearance.

This morning when I went to leave, I waited for the door to open fully, then
went to drive out.  Click, I heard the door start to close and then, BANG!
as it hit my roofrack, and CLATTER as the roof rack came crashing to the
ground in front of the bus.  In shock, I got out, picked up the now severely
bent roofrack and put it inside the van.  The rain gutter was bent so that
when I closed the side door it caught on the gutter and bent the top of the
door a little bit, too.  Sh*te!  I look in the passenger side mirror and
it's broken too, I guess one of the legs on the rack must have hit it.

I leave, driving to school, and am about 20 minutes away (having crossed a
major bridge) when I realize, oh ya, what about my spare tire?  It must have
fallen off.  I stop to call my boyfriend and ask him to look for the tire,
but as I'm dialing I look up on the roof and there it is, still sitting on
the fiberglass top.

The pop top is broken, split up the middle in front with cracks running all
along it.  There are dents in several places on the roof from the rack and
from the tire pressing on the poptop which pressed on the sheet metal.
Damn.  And I really really loved that roofrack.

I sure hope my insurance will cover this, but I don't know if they'll
believe that I didn't just drive right into the door, that it actually
closed on me.

Sad in Vancouver,
Diana
