	 &gt;Also, from the pics in the workshop manual, there appear to be
some form of pad that goes between the tank &gt;strap and tank... info please!


	I just finished this restoration on TUBAVAGEN.  There is
high-density felt under the straps on the gas tanks which serves as a
cushion to prevent wear between straps and gas tank.  It also acts as a
wonderful wicking device to hold water on your carbon steel gas tank.   If
you look under the felt there is almost always pitting of the tank wall
caused by moisture held in the pad.

	 I replaced my pads with 1/8&quot; neoprene gasket material.  Also placed
a strip of neoprene on the two raised cradles beneath the gas tank.  Nice
cushy ride for the Por-15 restored tank.

	One word of caution - neoprene is an excellent electrical insulator;
make sure you install a grounding lead from the tank to the frame to drain
off static.  Sparks &amp; gasoline vapor make great bombs!

	As for the fasteners holding the access panels to the bulkhead - my
were connected with six 10mm hex bolts which fastened to square nuts tacked
to  the bulkhead.
