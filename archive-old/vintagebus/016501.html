Subject: confused about timing update
Date: Wed, 31 May 2000 19:27:55 GMT

I installed a 035 distributer w/the vacuum advance.  My old bus engine 
seemed to have no problem with the 009 in it though.  Timing is at the tick 
mark (10 BTDC) as the Muir indicates.  I still have the same hesitation 
problem.  If I turn the distributer to advance the timing the engine RPM's 
raise and it runs smoother, and the hesitation is less severe.  I didn't 
leave it there in case of some problem that might occur that I don't know of 
yet.  It seems to have a slight backfire during the hesitation.  Thanks for 
the help in advance Volks.  Happy driving--Chet
