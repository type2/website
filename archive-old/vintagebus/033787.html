In a message dated 98-09-16 11:38:46 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt;  2) As I understand it, there are gasoline heaters designed to mount UNDER
 the seat in the back.  This is an alternative to the &quot;traditional&quot; gasoline
 heater that mounts in engine compartment.  (yes?)  Has anyone installed one
 of these in a Crew Cab that previously didn't have one.  Where does the hot
 air exit?  Is there a kit that comes with explaining where to run fuel lines
 and other goodies, or do you just figure out your own solutions? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steven,
Eberspacher built a gas heater for the VW trucks that mounted under the front
package tray.  So far we have only seen two of these in all the years we have
been in VWs.  Are you really sure that you need to get a gas heater for your
truck?  We have found that with our 1963 single cab that there is plenty of
heat (Down to 20F outside temp.) from the stock heating system if properly
maintained and repaired.
