I just called the my local  county  DMV Registration office and they say the
tittle to my 71 bus had been junked!  What am I gonna do now?  The Body of
the 71 is great, spent most of it's life in California.  I have the tittle
to my 76 but it sure is rusty and I will soon have the title for a 73 that's
not in the best shape too. Hmm what should I do?  Any advice gang?

Thanks,
