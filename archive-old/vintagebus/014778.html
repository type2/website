First off, a big thanks to the people who sent me links and contacts
for shrinking hammers.

Now I'm back to the well with another question: there appear to be
two different types: the &quot;solid&quot; type, and another with a spring-loaded
cam which is supposed to be able to shrink the metal more.  Which
type do I get?  The median price of the &quot;solid&quot; type is ~$25; the
price of the rotating-head type is ~$60.  The rotating version sounds
cool, but does it really do what it sez?

Thanks!

Thom
