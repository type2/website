Subject: Crew Cab Body Panels


Hello Guys/Gals,
This is my second post here...first one was invisible :)
I have a '67 crew cab that needs COMPLETE rocker panel replacement.  I am 
about to acquire a welder, is this something that I can accomplish? Or does 
this job need to be left to the proffesionals (sp)?
By the way- I'm selling my '57 oval for &quot;investment capital&quot; on the crew 
cab.  I tried thesamba- no luck- any other ideas?

Thx.
Jeremy
