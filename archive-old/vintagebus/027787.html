Subject: Bus built from NOS metal?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I was flipping through the newest Super VW (French mag) and it has part 3 of 
last years Classic. There is a picture that FREAKED me out. It appears to be 
a bullet turnsignal Kombi/Standard bus that is being built out of only NOS 
metal. And it looks like it's someone's attic? I can't read French so I don't 
know who/what/anything (SO why do I buy a French Mag if I can't read it?? 
PICTURES of course!!)
Can anyone shed some light on this?
I know that you are free to do what you want with your parts, but doesn't 
that seem like a waste of NOS panels? I know it would be cool to say &quot;this is 
my brand new 50's-60's bus built from all NOS replacement panels&quot; It seems 
that there way too many rare/special/wrecked buses that need panels 
replaced.... spread the wealth, I guess?
I guess I'm also in the &quot;keep the NOS stuff NOS&quot; camp. I've got these 
taillight lenses (that I bought for my friend's '60) that are still in the 
box and they will most likely stay in the box (because they can only be NOS 
once, and he found some other useable ones) unless I really, really need to 
use them (I'd rather run the repop plastic lenses 'cause I drive mine and 
wouldn't want someone to thug'em while it's parked)
Thanks,
