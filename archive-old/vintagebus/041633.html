&gt; &lt;&lt; As I recall, fuel line has to be certified and marked by the manufacturer,
&gt;  same as brake line.  I doubt that the fuel line you get at your flaps will
&gt;  be substandard.&gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi George,
&gt; Yes, but what is the standards?  6 months, 1 year or more?  

There are standards for all such hose, with SAE J30, ISO 4639-2 and DIN 
73379 among them.  The FLAPS hose I have in my hand has printed on it
&quot;PERFORMS TO SAE J30R7&quot;.  None of the German hose I've seen has any
standard printed on it.  Most of them just have the VW logo and the size.

&gt; &lt;&lt;As far as quality of rubber, I'm not all that impressed with German rubber. 
&gt;  Fuel lines that I replace every two years generally have cracks in their 
&gt; ends, where the SAE lines I put in my C*evy 5 years ago look fine.&gt;&gt;
&gt;  We have seen several times in American automobiles when thier fuel line 
&gt; suddenly  has a pin hole crack without warning.  Most of the time around the 
&gt; center of the length.  We rather have a fuel line that gives you a warning at 
&gt; it's ends that it is time to replace or fry!
&gt; Eric&amp;Barb

Agreed, but it's still good practice to replace hose every two years
regardless of how good it looks.  If I could find good US-made hose in
5mm, I'd use it whether it had the cloth cover exposed or not.

BTW, the VW hoses don't have an extra cloth covering, they just don't put
on the outer rubber layer that usually covers the cloth reinforcement.
