Subject: Im feeling pretty dumb right now


6 weeks ago I took the fan housing apart to clean it while the block was in
for a rebuild.  I am now putting everything together and am clueless as to
how t goes back together (the dumb part is that I should have put it
together while my memory was somewhat fresh, or took better notes).  The
books (i have) have only confused me more.

Can somebody out there know of/point me to a URL I can look at ??
