Look at what we have here, now... Letters to the Editor, and horrors,
letters to the other letters (unedited). Articles - How-To, Travel Tips,
Buy &amp; Sell, Humor, Vendor information &amp; recommendations (not influenced
by advertising bucks) and more. We have stuff here that no one
publishes, Bus poetry, Haiku, song lyrics, jokes, street comments. Tired
of reading &quot;articles&quot;? Go to the links, see the pictures. Pictures from
2 days ago and copies of ads placed in Life magazine 35 years ago. Soon
we'll have more than the mags can give; moving, talking pictures.  Free
for the most part. Stop buying magazines and you'll have $100 for a
WebTV in no time. 5 years or so, it'll be all wireless.
We need the basic manuals to get a procedure done out on the road, but
if you can plan it, print out a page or two of the Sermons and get'em
all grimy while you're working.
Sod the magazines, get your buddies on the 'net.
