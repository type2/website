&lt;&lt; Anyone know if the Abarth style muffler that Flat4 makes will fit a 65?  
Will it clear the bumper?  Or is it a type1 only muff?  Just curious  &gt;&gt;
Hi Pete,
Do not know if it will fit, but know that it will allow monoxide to get into 
the interior of your bus unless you install four tip extenders that go out to 
the side corner/s of the bus.
