In defense of my wife, she has been helpful at swaps
many times and mostly knows her stuff. At one event I
had a pile of singleport intakes for sale.  A couple
of guys pawed through the pile and picked a &quot;good&quot; one
stating that it would work well. Paula corrected them
saying that it wouldnt work at all. The guys talked
around Paula until she proved that the all knowing
males had picked up a 40HP intake. They bought one of
my 1600 intakes and shuffled away with ego bruised but
the right part. 
Another time she listened to a group of hispanic
gentlemen who &quot;came up from&quot; to negotiate on an old
Chevy pickup that I used to own. She looks like a
Juella &lt;white girl&gt; but is very fluent.  The guys
spoke out loud in the mother tounge that they would
offer way less than the truck was worth and mentioned
what the final price really ought to be. Paula faked
an urgent phone call and dragged me into the house to
convey the info.
The last thing I want in the VW scene is all guys.
BUT- Katy ought to wear doo-mee pumps, light colored
tube top and short-shorts with obvious T back lines at
least one Jerome event. ;-)
