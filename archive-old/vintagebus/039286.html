Subject: Interior rust, mechanism?
Date: Tue, 11 Aug 1998 05:35:22 -0700

I've been attempting to talk a local out of a '65 Deluxe
21 window walkthru.  Real nice guy, not sure he wants to
sell it, but he just got a camper and a double door panel, so . . . 
I should hear sometime this week, hopefully before the Bug Bash
so I can sell the '67 HTD.  Anyway, on to the '65 21 WTD . . .

The only rust found is on the cab floorboards up front, and it
has been patched with fiberglass.

I have a theory on the cab floor.  As feet move the mat, it rubs the 
paint, rust forms, the mat rubs the oxides off exposing more metal,
and the cycle continues.  This leads to the Swiss cheese look
so popular amongst busses.

The weird rust is that the cargo area floor against the seat
bulkheads is rusted a bunch.  The belly pans are in great
shape.  Everything else is in great shape.  To replace this 
area I'll need about 8 inches of metal back from the seat backs.
Is this metal available.

Are there structural concerns with this flooring missing?

Can this be welded without damaging nearby interior or exterior paint?

What can be done to slow the rust process in the closed
space between belly pans and floor?

The current owner thinks the rubber floor mats encourage
condensation and thus leading to rust under the mat.  I'm
not so sure.  What says the list?
