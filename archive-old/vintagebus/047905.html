Hi Josh,
First, good for you the welding of the seams of the sheet metal to the heater
tubes is helpfull to keep the heat going where you want it during the winter.
The heaters cool themselfs during the summer when the heat is turned off to
the interior by venting through that funny clamshell shaped sheet metal piece
on each of the backsides of the forward end of the heater boxes.  So your
welding will not affect this.  On the otherhand you really have not done much
to keep out the exaust gases since the positive pressure of the heater boxes
will already do this.  Unless you weld the engine sheet metal to the body and
then the engine and upper hatch also you will get exaust leaks into the
interior of the bus due to the lower pressure of the interior at driving
speeds.  So sealing the exaust and making sure that the tip of the muffler
goes out to the side of the bus to get the exaust into the slip stream and
away from the rear of the bus is far more important.  If you are installing
those exaust dounuts.  Coat them and the surfaces they seal to with high temp
copper silcon sealant.  This seems to seal those little gaps that later turn
into bigger and bigger exaust leaks.
