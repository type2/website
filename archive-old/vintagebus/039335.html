Question 1:
-What initial compression ratio should I run on an engine that will be 
supercharged?

Question 2:
- Does anyone have the H.P. Book on supercharging the air cooled VW engine? 
What are the fundamental Do's and Dont's from this book? What about a 
contact address for the H.P. Book series?

Question 3:
- Has anyone ever run a Spearco brand water injector on an air cooled VW 
engine for the purpose of intercooling the compressed air-gasoline mixture?
