&lt;&lt; Will this be a difficult task? I don't want to get in over my head here. 
Also, Can I just buy the type of hose I need at say an Autozone?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Greg,
Not if you take a section of flexable fuel line cut to length to match the 
one connected directly to the tank and plug one end of this new fuel line 
with something like a golf tee or a philips screwdriver.  So when you remove 
the old fuel line from the tank you can immeadiately push on this new section 
with it's pluged end to seal off the gasolene.  That way you can replace all 
the other fuel lines without dripping fuel all over.  Do be very carefull not 
to cause a spark while you doing this!  A president of NEATO was doing the 
same job years ago and when the fuel was leaking all over he grabbed a steel 
drain pain to slide under the leak.  Unfortunitly when he slid the pan it 
struck a spark on the concrete floor.  From what we have heard he, his bus, 
and his garage where quite badly burned!  We advise using only the cloth 
covered German fuel line.  This subeject was discussed just four or five days 
ago on the list so you might want to check out the archives!   Eric&amp;Barb
