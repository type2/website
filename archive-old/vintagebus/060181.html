Hello All,
 Don't forget that we have a club meeting in 2 weeks.
Saturday night , September 7th starting between 7-7:30 pm. Last month we had
10 members out .Lets try to get more people out , even if you cant drive
your VW. After all we have over 50 club members. I think we can get more
than 10 folks out.
the Meeting is at South 21 drive in Restaurant on South Bvd. Go to the main
page on the club website for more info.
www.mvwe_dot_org

Also the Toccoa GA show is the Sunday after the meeting , September 8th
That is a real good show if anyone is interested.

Thanks,
Metrolina VW Enthusiasts
