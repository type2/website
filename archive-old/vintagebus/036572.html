Subject: shocking and sparking
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Had pulled the motoir out of the 61 to do things like get rid of the warped 
doghouse fan and be able to tighten down the fuel tap (a lot easier w/o the 
motor)  Put the motor back in the 61 the other day, and it woulnd not start.  
The  Engine spun almost caught and stopped.  There was only about a gallon in 
the tank, but the tap was pulled to reserve.  Maybe it's the spark plug 
wires.  couldn't be , I checked after I cleaned the plugs.  I'll double 
check.  Yup, # 3 and #4 were swapped.  I swapped them back, it started right 
up purr.

But the guages act wierd.  The oil pressure guage reads off when the bus is 
ig on, but when the engine starts it pegs.  The oil temp guage reads 270 when 
the ig is on, but when the engine is started it reads 0.  and the both wires 
change when the oil press wire is pulled/grounded  I think the wires unde 
rthe bus may be messed up.  Eric where did you get the pre wrapped trailer 
wire with 3 or 4 wires in it?  Home Depot?

ANd I got my new shocks in the mail yesterday.  Pulled off the front shocks,  
The old ones were VW shocks!!! with  a VW logo and VW part number, made by 
fiskel &amp; saches, in late 63, jeez, these shocks were replaced a couple years 
after the car was new, but not since.   Okay, the metal bushing stuck to the 
lower arm.  I took the protective gear and a angle grinder and with two hands 
gentlly ground a flat side to the bushing, while holding the flashlight in my 
third hand.  Then used the vice grips on it with spray lube I could tist the 
bushing and twist it off.   Usually requires banging and yelling somewhere in 
the process too.   Call it a b&amp;tch monkey and the old shock will pop off in 
awe.  Anyway, I have all these old VW shocks, I'm gonna hang them on the 
wall.  Might as well, might as well. 

see, the idea is to go camping at Ocean Shores or somewhere up on the 
Pennisula, maybe this weekend.  If anyone wants to join in a camping trip p 
mail, maybe I' ll see if the wetwesties are doing anythiung, but I lost the 
contact info for getting on that list.

Much nicer with new shocks.  Got the KYB GR-2s.  Pretty much the only clean 
thing under that bus, except the tranny.

Back ones today.
