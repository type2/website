A guy who helped me out on my recent cross country trip (with free parts =
BTW) needs some '66 or earlier bug axles.  He has the later longer ones =
to trade...the ones that I think are used in lowering a bus...if any of =
you out there can help him out it would be great.  Call him for the =
details.  Tell him Dan, the guy who broke down in the crew cab sent you.

His info:
