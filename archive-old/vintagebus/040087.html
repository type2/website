i have a book... &quot;50 Years of the Bus&quot; i think... and it has some great bus 
production shots. i can try to scan some tomorrow if you want, they are 
cool. bus production was really labor intensive. there was a HUGE zink 
primer tank that they dipped the whole shell of the bus into... and there 
was a wet sanding part of the line where water dripped on the buses that 
went by as few guys sanded down any imperfections. every bus from commercial 
to deluxe was treated the same... perfection.
