&gt;Now, I see minivans with local tags, that 
&gt;appear to be carrying kids on short trips in town, &gt;with the LCD deployed in the back seat.  WTF?
&gt;Just because you _can_ have the kids in front of the &gt;TV whenever they're not sleeping or in school &gt;doesn't mean you _should_.

Amen Brother,

As a 30 year old with two kids under 7, I know the stresses/complaints of the under 48&quot; tall crowd.

In my bus, I have a rolling kids backpack (all the rage now) filled with kids books and activity books. 

I call it the &quot;bus library&quot;. The boys love the concept of &quot;bus&quot; attached to anything because they relate it to Dad, and they feel a part of what's going on.

I NEVER hear a word from the backseat, unless it's friendly and amicable and I don't have a TV in my bus.

2 cents,

Billy
(gettin' tired of seeing people with dreadlocks/tiedyes feeding kids McDonalds &amp; TV
