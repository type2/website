Hi Craig,
Possibly, but more likely your valve geometery was so far off the valves were 
being pushed too much sideways causing that valve to stick due to too much 
friction in its guide.  To reduce this side thrust pressure to a minimum and 
the guide wear it will cause, one has to shim the rocker arms and/or 
procure/fabricate shorter/longer push rods so as to make sure that all the 
rocker arm set screws halfway through the arc of the rocker arms movement is 
perfectly aligned with the valve stem.
