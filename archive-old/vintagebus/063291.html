Subject: Re: [VB] Ceramic choke coil insert--6v or 12v?

&gt;
&gt;The ceramic-bodied ones caught my eye, as the 30-PICT-1 in my 67
&gt;DC has had one since I bought it.  But the seller tells me, all
&gt;ceramic choke coils are 6v only, not 12v.  Was he right?

I don't know for sure.  I know you can get 6v metal choke coils;
the Mexican 28-PICT-1 (Solex/Brosol) in my Bus has one.  &quot;6 V&quot; is
clearly cast into the cover.  On page K-2 11 Bentley mentions the
metal choke coils as starting with the 28-PICT-1 in November 1963,
which means the ceramic ones up to that time would have all been
6 volt.  (I wonder if the ones on M 620 (12 volt) buses were
ceramic, though.)  The FLVWPS has the same 6v-ceramic 12v-metal
distinction that your vendor made.

Is the ceramic coil marked at all as to voltage?  If it seems to
work I wouldn't worry about it...if it goes out, replace it with
one that you know is 12 V.
