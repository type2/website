   I just received the photos of the new EMPI TOY BUS, this is a Johnney
Lightning Bus painted in the EMPI Inch Pincher Logo. If anyone is interested
I am taking verbal or e-mail pre orders on these (no money or CC info needed
yet, just want to make sure I get enough to go around). This is a limited
production item 5000. I'm just passing this along to those collecting toys.
This are in collaboration with EMPI sponsoring the CLASSIC this year.

ps. I can't release a photo, but I'm sure somewhere on the www  they are out
there.
