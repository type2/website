My '54 RHD deluxe is sitting pushed to the side of the garage,
spider webs having grown between it and the wall &amp; the
ceiling (seriously!), forgotten like a youthful dalliance,
but in the way like the illegimate child of such a union.

The '60 DD is sitting in it's little costco shelter, napping.
I alternate between the DD and the 911 every now and then.

The '55 single cab (for sale, BTW - make offer!) is sitting out back,
with a friend ('64 single cab) over for an extended visit.
