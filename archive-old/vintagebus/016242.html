If it factory you can use the BENTLY manual as a refrence.A bus could be
ordered with many factory and/or dealer installed extras.There are two
different slide staps,one with sub floors and one without sub floors.

Subject: [VB] slide out step


Hello list,
I am looking for information on a slide out spring loaded step that I have 
removed from a 63 deluxe.  Could a 67 Westy have come with such a step? Does

anyone have info or pictures of this step they could share? The step is very

rusty but can be repaired, I am just unsure how it should look and operate.

As always thanks for any help.
