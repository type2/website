Are you saying that you can't tell the R&amp;P without taking off parts of the

transaxle?


If so, this isn't true... If you search the archives you will find that I

documented a method of determining the gear ratio by jacking up 1 wheel and

couting the number of Turns of engine pully to wheel.  The numbers come out

in such a way that it is pretty easy to figure it out.


I put together a web page back in January...

The size of your tires do not matter for this test, you take the tire off :)

Hi Stephen, I am saying you cannot see what is in there.

I remember you posted this website before (or a similar one) and the 
explanation was so confusticated  that it seems to take too much time to 
figure out.    Can't check it now, no colour in screen shows webpage as 
blurs,  perhaps it is straightforward today.  if so, great.

never the less,  it is a good idea to see what your rpms are, IMOPBO, as that 
is what matters as you go down the road.
