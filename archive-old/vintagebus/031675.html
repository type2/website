It amazes me how 1 persons post can change the life's of so many bus people.
This thread should of had the brakes put on way back in the beginning and
bus life styles should have prevailed.

OK, let's leave Erin alone and get back to the business of enjoying our
hobby.
We come from different areas, different backgrounds and different cultures,
so anyone who is a high profile member of the group, such as Erin is, will
eventually become a lightning rod for criticism.
IMHO, Erin is perfectly within his rights to post whatever he feels is
appropriate for the rest of the list to read. But in doing so, will
undoubtedly ruffle someone's feathers. That's human nature.

(Speaking to NQ now,) The only thing that I take exception to Erin, is your
post where you mention having an &quot;off-list&quot; discussion with Kevin and then
you quote him out of context. That's not really fair to Kevin, or for that
matter to the list.

I have met Erin and enjoyed meeting him, he doesn't need me to defend him on
the list. His contribution to our common interest is, i'm sure heartfelt and
valuable.

I wish these damn thunderstorms would pass so I can get away from the
computer and back to the bus.
John :-)
