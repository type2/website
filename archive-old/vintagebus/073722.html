Subject: Re: [VB] looking for Randy Long

I don't know how good this may still be, but three years years ago when 
I bought my slats, I had vwgeek_at_flash_dot_net and ph. 562-690-9416 (after 
4pm) for contacting Randy.

&gt; Anyone know how to get a hold of Randy Long. the guy that makes the wood
&gt; slats?  I want some made out of Gaboon Ebony or some other similar
&gt; exotic black wood. for the double cab.. And with the correct blunt
&gt; forward ended long strips and double ended slant shorter pieces.  I'm
&gt; thinking the black ebony would look nice against all those chromed
&gt; original screws I have. :-)   It will also keep my color count down on
&gt; the dc as well (blue, black, gray, and chrome).
