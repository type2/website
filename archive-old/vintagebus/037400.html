&lt;&lt; Wish I would have know to do this 10 years ago.
 Thanks much for the info. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jim,
You are welcome!  We are glad our info has helped!  If you liked the results 
from that then here is the next step to getting rid of those voltage drop 
gremilins in your VW wiring harness!  The 1961-67 VW fuse boxes have two 
clips one each side of each fuse (The far left six fuses have siamese clips 
on the upper to power both fuses at the same time.).  These clips are slipped 
into the fuse box bakelite body and held there by a locking tab built into 
the male brass clip.  If you have a spare fuse box this really helps keep 
things neat/tidy or if not remove your fuse box and tape/mark each wire or 
set of wires where they belong.  Either way check for cracks in the baklite 
and loose clips falling out.  Clean the brass clips by phosperic acid 
treating the whole fuse box (Naval Jelly from your FLHWS will work.) to clean 
off all the surface corrosion.  When the brass pieces look nice and shiney 
rinse with water, then towel and oven set on warm dry.  Then apply a small 
amount of flux to the rear side of the clips and put the small or medium 
soldering iron to the front (FIF) of each of the fuse block clips.  Heat the 
clips one by one till you can get a small amount of solder to melt and drawn 
into the clips.  If you have previously had to add more wires to the fuse box 
with slip on doubler clips you can also solder male slip on clips broken off 
from junked fuse boxes out of 1961-79 VWs.   This will reduce future wiring 
problems!
  For the pre-1961 fuse box follow the above removing cleaning instructions, 
but do not acid clean the zinc plated wire screws with acid unless they are 
totally rusted in place.  Then solder the two sets of brass head light links 
to the rivets that hold them on the front (FIF) of the fuse box and solder 
the upper side of the fuse box wire screw terminal posts to the fuse spring 
clips.  Remember a little solder goes a long way!  Eric&amp;Barb
