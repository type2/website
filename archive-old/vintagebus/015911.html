I haven't given up! The '54 Barndoor Ambocamper still
hasn't sold. The season is warming up and so is
interest in the bus.
Jan Peters of VVWCA took some nice photos of the bus
at the recent &lt;April 1, 2000&gt; Phoenix Bug-o-Rama.
These shots will soon be updated to the ad on
VWPlanet. See &lt;http://thesamba_dot_com/vw&gt; soon or request
a Winzip file via pmail to ellisjames_at_yahoo_dot_com.
Just think- if you put your techstock profits into
this VW instead of more stock you'd have a kickaz bus
by now! Now what do you have besides NASDAQ heartburn?
Thanks for all of the inquiries. Invest in precious
metal.
