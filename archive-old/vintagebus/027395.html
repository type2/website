Subject: was Sound &amp; Noise Insulation Q

Hello Friends-
I have looked into this insulation a bit.  I currently have a naked,
sheet metal bus in my garage half finished with POR-15 (floor boards and
window troughs).  I have not used any of the insulation ideas yet, but I
have found some interesting information at:
http://bulley-hewlett_dot_com/VWindex/

Cool pics!

Summary:  This site covers the use of Evercoat Q-pads (used by upscale
luxury cars as sound deadening) and fiberous roofing cement from Kool
Seal (http://www.koolseal_dot_com) painted over the top of the pads.  He
then followed with other fiber insulation in the door panels, being
careful to prevent trapped moisture.

He also used &quot;Nasa-grade&quot; insulation over the engine cover.

JC Whitney appears to have this stuff.  THey do not have the Q-pads
(very expensive!) but offer a substitute brand.

Evercoat sells the stuff on line (http://www.evercoat_dot_com), as does PBE
direct (http://www.pbedirect_dot_com) who for some reason quote as les
expensive (last I looked).

I found the Stinger Roadkill Pro in sheet, spray, and carpet insulation
form at http://www.autotoys_dot_com.  This appears to be popular with the
local car stereo installers.

As I said, I have not used it yet.  But welcome further input...

Good luck
