Subject: Rubbing noise

I was about a block from home yesterday when I noticed a slight &quot;thud&quot;
and then a grinding noise coming from my '66 Westy. It sounds like metal
to metal grinding.
I drove it home and parked it, and since it was easter, I didn't have
time to investigate. I just looked underneath but didn't see anything
out of order.
The brakes seemed to work OK on the way back, I didn't experience any
pulling or lack of braking ability, but something is rubbing against
something and I wonder if anyone has any tips on what to look for.
