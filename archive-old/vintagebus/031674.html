I made a couple of adapters for tire shops back in Cali. I took early front
bug drums and machined the drum part off of it, to make a flat adapter,
kinda like spindle mounts. I them pressed in studs for lug nuts. After all
was done I took them to a place that balances torque converters and had it
balanced, with the lug nuts on it. I gave this to my godfather who owns a
tire store and to this day they still use it, as far as I know, for
balancing VW and early Porsche wheels.

&gt; &lt;&lt; n case it's different elsewhere, I can't (until now!) find anywhere

&gt; Couldn't you just take one of the cheesy chevy wheel adapters down, bolt
it 
&gt; to the wheel,  and balance it using the smaller hole in the adapter?

You can, providing:

The adapter is truly concentric
The adapter is balanced
The balancing guy is willing to install the kludge on his
multi-thousand-dollar machine!
