Hi Rich,
Yup, wish we could have!  A year or two later after we move to a rental house 
(Converted chicken coop with painted cardboard interior walls!).  We spotted 
a 1960 walkthru panel van camper conversion parked at an apartment and never 
seemed to move.  Barb left one of our hobby cards on the windshield.  About a 
year later we got a call from the owner.  He wanted $300.00 for it and it 
only needed an engine.  The 1600 DP engine that came with it had a nice hole 
through the top of the engine case, where a rod had let loose.  We told him 
we were not interested due to having too many VWs (Including the ones we had 
previously in storage before moving to this house.) on the property in 
Kirklad Wash..  Which is the Yuppy capitol of the world (We actually had a 
town official tell us we did not belong living in Kirkland!) where if you do 
not drive a late model sports car you are dirt.  But we would pass the word 
onto others about his bus.  Same result telling everyone we knew.  The fellow 
called us a month later and talked to Barb.  He now would take $200.00 for 
it!  Barb said we were still not interested and had told everyone we could.  
He immeadiately he told Barb that we could have it for free.  Turns out he 
was moving and the apartment management had tried to have it towed off and 
they would charge him for the towing.  Barb hesitated a moment, but knew what 
would happen if Eric found out if a free bus was turned down.  ;-)  We towed 
it with a chain the 1/2 mile to our place.  Funny thing is Eric has wanted to 
sell this bus since we have got it running perfectly and put the money from 
it into other VWs of our's, but Barb has bonded to it and will not sell it!
