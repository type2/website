I gotta hand it to you man - your have all kinds of gumption.  Pulling
engines repeatedly like that really pisses me off and had I been in your
shoes, probably would have whined to the list again like a big baby about
wanting to sell my dubs off.  I think sometimes I'd have a better attitude
if I had a shop and could make it a little easier on myself instead of
rolling around on a drive way.

I admire people like you.  It keeps the lazy butts like me inspired and in
check.
