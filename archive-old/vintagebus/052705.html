Subject: Re: [VB] Sick tranny questions

I've been using a freeway flier with a 1600 DP in my crewcab for the
last year. It works just fine. Of course, it cuts down on your ability
to pull the big hills in 4th gear, but that's what 3rd gear is for
anyway. 8^)

It really all depends on how you want to use the truck. Mine never hauls
anything more than a few chairs home from yard sales. It's mostly used
as my ride to work, so the higher gears are what I want. I like the good
gas mileage. I get 22-23 mpg when I'm not using my gas heater. If you
plan to carry a bunch of weight in the truck often, you might want to
stick with the stock ring and pinion setup.
