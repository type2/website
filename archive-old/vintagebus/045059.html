I just put a 1600 w/ a bus exhaust in the 58 with no major problems.
Didnt even have to take off the rear bumper!

Enter it in the registry, and then do a search for yourself, and it
will decode all the stuff.

You *can put fresh-air heater boxes in an early car, but you either
have to (ahem) clearance the two sponts on the firewall where
they'll hit, or make some (ahem) adjustments to the heater boxes
themselves.  I was able to get repro heater boxes and a 1600 into my
'56 with no real problems.  You also need to &quot;dip&quot; the motor slightly
to get the front part of the heater boxes under the firewall, then
flatten it out and it should go right in.&gt;&gt;
