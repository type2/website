Clara spoke:
&gt; actually I think they were sold from the dealership as replacement lenses
for
&gt; BDs.  for whatever reason, there are many more of those around NOS than
other
&gt; BLDL bus taillights.   so correct according to VW replacement parts, but
not
&gt; according to what actually came on the bus?
&gt;
Yes, that's what I was getting at.  Actually, it my understanding that
replacement single-filament &quot;bubble&quot; taillights (Barndoor) do not have the
VW and Hella stamps in the chrome while the originals do.  Some of each
(used) have passed through my hands.

I have seen approx. 5 sets of NOS Barndoor bubble taillights in the past 3
years in the U.S. and 15-20 of the 55-57 Euro single filament style.  Prices
should vary accordingly but they often do not.
