Subject: FRI: Family Found on Vintage Bus List

We many times refer to other listees as parts of our extended family.
Thanksgiving brought a discovery yesterday that part of my extended family is
here on the list also.
Laura (PadresGrrl_at_aol_dot_com) [58 westy]
My wife's cousin is married to Laura's father-in-law.   No it's not as a big of
a stretch as it sounds.  It also turns out that we had previously met about a
year and a half ago at an 80th birthday party for family. (we did talk busses)

Here's the lineage
    VintageBusList - Read by Scott ('60 Crew)
       Scott - married to Nanette
          Nanette &lt;-&gt; Marlene - Cousins
              Marlene -  married to Steve
                  Steve  - has son Mike
                     Mike - married to Laura
                         Laura - reads VintageBusList ('58 Westy)

The westy has been in Laura's family since day 1.  She responded to my inquiry
about learning to drive in a bus without realizing the family connection. (she
learned to drive in the '58)

How was this discovered?

Something in the back of my head kept telling me that I knew her email address
from somewhere else every time I saw her messages on the list.  Yesterday she
put a Thanksgiving note on the list and there was her last name.  PadresGrrl
sounds like a San Diego Padres fan and since Steve lives in San Diego area, I
took a shot and emailed her and asked if she was related to Steve.  When I got
the message back &quot;He's my father-in-law!!!!&quot;  I finally put it all together.  I
remembered her email address as being on the distribution list from messages
that I have gotten from Steve.  Since I was out most of yesterday, she ended up
calling Steve to find out the connection.  My mother-in-law had just left
Steve's when Laura called over there!

Kinda fun discovering family connections during the holidays.

Happy Holidays to all,

Scott
