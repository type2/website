Subject: RE: [VB] bus insurance Replacement value USA ???

Just a little note to you guys about insurance. The company I work for,
while not an insurance company, works in the insurance field. My parents
were in insurance their whole carreers. Even though employees will tell you
they have to follow certian rules or guidelines, the whole insurance thing
can vary tremendously. It's kinda like DMV. Depends on local management and
local employees.

I can tell you this. Regardless of how much you insure the vehicle for,
they will not give you your money without trying to screw you first. It's
just the way these companies do things. It's absurd, but that's the way it
works. Best thing to do is what Thom says and save tons of documentation.
If you ever have to replace it it's gonna be a fight. Good idea to find
someone in the business to either handle it for you or to help. Having
another insurance person on the phone helps keep YOUR insurance company
from lying about what they can or can't do. And believe me, they WILL lie
to you without even a wince. Just my opinion.
