&gt;&gt; This is the season when we remember that the Three Wise Men brought the
magic pumpkin to the Feral
Chocolate Bunny so there would be Peace On Earth and six more weeks of
winter.  In the spirit of holiday giving, therefore, we give you the
inestimable work of Chris and Gina.  This is the best thing since the
Flannel Bus Underwear (which by the way really is for sale at Target in the
United States, we kid you not).
