&gt;so i tightened the linkpins as per Muir - when i now push at 12:00 and
&gt;6:00 should there be absolutly no movement at all - or is movement that
&gt;is measured in millimetres (or do americans spell it millimeters :))
&gt;normal - seems to me that the left is exactly the same as before i
&gt;started - an incredibly small amount of play - so small in fact that i
&gt;had to push a few times just to notice it -
&gt;
&gt;thanks

If your wheel bearings aren't correctly adjusted, you will still feel play.
If your linkpins are adjusted to the limit, you will still feel play. Pull
one of the bottom retaining bolts out and look at it. If the side is galled
and/or worn, you might get some more wear out of the linkpins by replacing
them with the absolutly correct replacement bolt and then repeating the
procedure for all four. Keep in mind that the amount of adjusment the four
new bolts will give you is small, and linkpin replacement is in the top ten
on your hit parade. To improve the wear of the linkpins, I release the
bolts, and back the linkpins off prior to greasing, then tighten them as per
spec after. This is a routine additional five minute part of my front end
greasing. and makes sure that some grease is getting to where the wear is
happening. If you don't do it this way, the only place the grease goes is
wherever the metal isn't touching. Is no too good, yes? Hope this helps, if
not I would not listen to me anymore.
