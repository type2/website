Well, I've probably seen and extinguished more engine fires than
almost anyone on the list...

It depends on how involved the engine is, as to wether or not it will blow
up in your face.  You need to excercise *extreme* caution in opening the
lid, both for blowout, and because if it's been going for any length of
time, the engine lid handle will be HOT.  We would start a stream of water
at the same time the other guy would be opening the hood, just in
case.  We also had the benefit of turnouts, face shields and breathing
apparatus.  Oh, and 1000 gallons or so of water charged with a foaming
element...

Many, many engine fires have been extinguisshed by the hapless driver
on the side of the road, and so can you with a bit of caution.

Shooting your extinguisher into the vents would be a waste of time and a waste
of the charge.

A couple things will help you here: one, try and keep the engine fairly
clean, which will greatly reduce the rate of spread if you *do* have a fire.
All that grease will go up in a second.  I try to keep my engines very
clean, and this saved my bacon one time when my generator siezed on
the '56, and the fan belt caught on fire.  I had flaming peices of
rubber all over the engine compartment, but they had nothing to burn,
so I was able to put them out with a bottle of water, and didn't have to 
unload an extinguisher.

Another thing that will help is if your engine prop is installed and 
working correctly.  Don't get in the habit of having to use the
top hatch to hold the engine lid open.  You don't want to be having to
hold the engine lid with one hand while you try to fight the fire with
the other.  And letting it slam back down will only make matters worse.

And I think the church key system stinks in this regard - it's too much of 
a pain if you have to open the engine lid in a hurry!  And if you
have a locking lid, keep it unlocked when you're driving.  Nobody is
going to steal your battery while you're flying down the freeway 
at 100kph.

Of course, this is all academic,because you all have spanky new fuel lines,
right?

&gt; a bottle of b.b.q. sauce for your face because it would be charred. i saw in 
&gt; high school that the advice was to (on those sorry front engine type of 
&gt; cars) spray the extinguisher into the grill first. i am not sure if this 
&gt; would work on our superior machines' vents, but if you have a spare second 
&gt; during the fire i hope it might save some eyebrows.
