 Forget all the new crap and do like we have been doing for 30 years;
sawzall the front beam in 2 places and drive the bus for a couple days and
have 3 friends stand on the front bumper and weld the beam back together.
Instant 3 to 4 inches lower and you look kool going over the speed bumps.
Took 4 friends for me 1 time.
