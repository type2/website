Just thought I would chime in on the oil pressure light. I have a problem with
mine, every now and then it comes on, usually for just a brief moment. I am
nott sure what is causing it. 

I think it is only happening when i am turning a corner with some velocity,
although i am not sure of this (i need to pay more attention)

Haven't figured it out yet.

I had a similar problem last spring, which went away by itslef, than came back
recently.
