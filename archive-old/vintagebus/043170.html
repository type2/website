&gt; Hi, 
&gt; Other than needing the proper face plate for bus this looks compleate.  Note
&gt; the 1967 only radio knobs!  Eric &amp; Barb
&gt; 
&gt; (Auction #  77534134    VW '60's 12 volt radio 1967 works well nice)
&gt; 

I have an original 67 Saffire V AM in my 67, but except for the inner part
of the radio (dial and buttons area), the white bezel is black textured,
and the knobs are dual-level chrome (outer ring on left is TONE, inner is
VOLUME, right knob is TUNING)

Much nicer in my opinion!
