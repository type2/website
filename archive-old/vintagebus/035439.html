Pat,

I specialize in VW transaxles and am presently
building several for list members.  You might
consider switching out the ring and pinion set
for the later Type 1 3.875 as it will give you 
increased highway driveability.

I have  heard good reports from both Rancho and
 Carter's Gearbox Shop down in California but
have no first hand experience with their product.
