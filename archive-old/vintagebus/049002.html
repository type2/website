Subject: [VB] Rare Headlight Lense Question

I was just informed that there was a clear early bus headlight lense made with the VW logo on it and a circle in the center of the lense.  I had never heard of this beast before, and of course would now like to find a set instead of going with fluted lenses on the '59.  Fluted lenses means bulb holders, etc. which I'm not sure I want to monkey with.  And just throwing fluted lenses over a sealed beam ain't gonna work right either.

I have a novel idea.  Why don't I just use regular clear lenses and regular sealed beam headlights.  Nah, too easy!  

Anyone else know about these lenses?  Anyone got a set they'd like to trade or sell?

Robert
