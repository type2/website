I have a book called &quot;Volkswagen  Bus-Camper-Van   1954-1967&quot;  It is
published by Brookland Books in England, phone # 0932 865051  Maybe they
have a web site, I don't know.  Anyway, there are 3 separate articles
about the Devon (Caravette)  and one article about making your own camper
interior for a bus.  They are interesting and maybe they would answer
some of your questions. 

The book says &quot;Makers: Caravan conversion by Lisburne Garage, Babbacombe
Road, Torquay, Devon&quot;  
It also says that it was distributed in London by Stratstone Ltd. at 40
Berkeley St., London
Hope this helps some.
