&gt; On every fresh air cover I have ever removed, there are three pieces of the 
&gt; rubber stripping on the sides and upper edge but the lower edge has some 
&gt; form of goo that is used to seal things up.  Anyone have an idea of a good 
&gt; representative of this stuff....

Hi David,
On all of the buses we have taken apart that is just the grey puddy like 
stuff used to seal to the body on the aftermarket camper type windows.
