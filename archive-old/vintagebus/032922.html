&lt;&lt; Barb and Eric wrote that too rich could also cause this. I hadn't gathered
that it was running rough or puffing black smoke, so I didn't lean this way,
but it is of course a possibility.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Kyle,
Just went through this mess with our 1960 panel that has a 1641cc single port
engine with 30 PICT-1 carb, 40HP air cleaner, stock 1600cc muffler.  The spark
plugs and muffler tip were black with soot from running too rich.  Went to
smaller size main (From 130 to 117) and HP definitely increased, but did not
get rid of black soot and caused trouble going from idle to acceleration.  So
tried smaller sized air correction jets (135-120) which should have increased
the richness of the fuel mixture since the air correction jet allow more air
in with the bigger the # size.  The change from idle to acceleration just got
worse if you pushed down on the accelerator pedal too fast the engine tried to
die.  So tried the largest sized air correction jet (145) that we had and
things got much better, but not perfect especially when the bus was cold.
Finally went and changed the main jet from the 117 to a 122 and the bus has no
hesitation plus takes off so fast it is hard to keep up with the shifting to
keep the engine from flying over 3000RPMs in 1-3 gear.  Hopefully these
changes will improve our MPG and allready know it has improved our HP.  During
all this time we never had the bus run uneven or have visible black smoke come
out of the tailpipe.  Hope this all helps others out there,   Eric &amp; Barb 
     PS Getting a jet measurement tool for $25.00 was a very good investment
for us.  Found many jets that had either been drilled or worn till they were
alot bigger than there origianal markings and even found some of the jets
including new ones to be smaller than thier markings.  Alot of confusion was
avoided by having the tool to measure these incorrect jets.  EEE&amp;B
