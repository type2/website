Hi Joe;

I don't have first-hand information for VW Dormobile conversions (hang
on, all will become clear), but I ran an English Ford Thames Dormobile
conversion for many years and I believe a lot of the hardware and
arrangements are similar.

The Thames van had a pretty flimsy body structure, and a rudimentary
ladder frame.  With the big hole in the roof the result was a pretty
squirmy and flexible vehicle.  The point in all this is that the
Dormobile conversion incorporated all sorts of under floor storage
spaces, which were closed with enough hatches to supply a small
submersible.  The actual &quot;floor&quot; was marine plywood about 5/8&quot; thick, and
the hatches were steel sheet with aluminum molding around the edges.

Bottom line, gobs of additional storage and no apparent increase in
body/chassis flex.  VWs are a bit different in construction, of course,
but there's a lot of potential for added storage under there and it might
be worth the effort to check out a VW Dormobile and see what's been
installed/modified.
