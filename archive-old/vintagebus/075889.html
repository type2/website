Subject: Re: [VB] stuck drum again

sometimes when the shoes aren't centered one edge will be caught up on the 
drum.   If you can get the drum on, stomp on the brakes a few times and see how 
that is. That'll also center the shoes, shift them over, like.   Does that 
change the drag on the shoe/drum interface?   If the drum won't go on, I tap the 
end of the shoes to center them so the drum will go on.  You have to look at 
the end of the shoe to see where it drags, and tap it slightly the other way.  

So ya, though you are supposed to adjust first, just adjust where you can at 
first, fill with fluid, bleed, and them adjust again.  Bleed again in 50 miles 
or when the pedal gets more space, whichever is soonest, as the shoes will 
still center a tad, plus the edges will wear in quick at first.  I avoid getting 
drums turned unless they are badly grooved.

Don't forget to adjust your brakes and grease suspension at every 3K tuneup.

****hm, looking at the pic some more, I am thinking the left shoes where it 
goes into the top whel cylinder looks funny.  Peel back that dust cover 
carefully and make sure the end of the shoe is in the slot in the wheel cylinder 
piston*** 

 Because of this being easy to do, I usually put the shoes on with the dust 
covers on the shoes (not the cylinders), peeled back inside out sort of, so I 
can see it go into the cyliner right, then pull the dust cover back onto the 
cylinder with a little screwdriver, making sure it is settled on all sides.

 it, so there are some serious rust issues...
 ........................
 Now, I've installed all new wheel cylinders, metal
 lines, bearings, and shoes, but when i put the drum
 back on it won't turn again! the adjusting stars are
 turned down as small as they can go. what gives? the
 drum is totally hanging up on the shoes...
 will this be resolved when i put fluid in the system,
 and pump the pedal a few times? 
 do i need to have the inside of the drums resurfaced?
 they're a little pitted and rusty, but still about 50%
 shiny surface...
 it's only stuck on the driver's side.
 
 thanks for advice!
