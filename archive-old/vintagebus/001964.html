Hi All,

Well after several of the post today about junk yards, I went down today to
our local spot which has a 15 window 63 walk through which, for a serious
person, could be resurrected but, it's fairly gone.  I got a few little
trinkets.  Several of the side pop out windows are there in good condition
(Sigla glass), some latches with white knobs in fair shape (3 I think that
weren't broken), both front outside door handles, inside cargo door handle
and mechanism, three jail bar ends, rear engine lid in repairable shape
(left side bent but other than that, straight) and that's about it... cargo
doors in semi ok shape...

But hey, that's not what I'm writing about....  I pulled the speaker out and
noticed that it had some form of screen in front of it... was this from the
factory or had the last owner put window screen in front of the speaker to
keep trash out?  What is supposed to be there?


Thanks
