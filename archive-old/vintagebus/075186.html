Subject: Re: [VB] How do you convert a 65' from 6volt to 12 volt ?

I have a 59 singlecab that the turn signals blink fast.  It was &quot;converted&quot; 
to 12v by the PO.  The truck is using the original 6V relay.  The lights all 
work and function currectly, just flash fast.  Is there anyway to slow them 
down?

----Original Message Follows----
One thing I've found on the Bus's that I've converted to 12 volts, is the 6V
signal relays work fine. Don't blink fast, and don't blink slow. Done this
with a 64 and a 66 bus, and have seen no long term issues.
