Subject: Re: [VB] Dipstick heater

&gt;&gt; Even a radiant heater laying on its back under the sump 
would probably work better than a little dipstick heater. &lt;&lt;

Even a light bulb in one of those old style cone shaped
aluminum reflectors will put out enough heat to keep
the bottom of the engine warm. It's probably something
you already have hanging around, so it's a cheap way
to see how well it works for your conditions.

If you have oil drips (busses never leak!) make sure
that the drip doesn't fall on the bulb, and fluorescents 
don't put out enough heat.

I'll admit that where I live the temps don't get cold
enough to justify extra heaters.
