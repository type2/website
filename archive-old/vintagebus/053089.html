Subject: Re: [VB] 64' conversion camper (fwd)

Dennis

One of these units was featured in VW Trends I believe last year and it is
an American conversion. Although this one did not have the pop-top. The
Caravalle emblem is a &quot;two masted&quot; tall ship on the ice box. Will see if I
can find the issue #.

&gt;
&gt; Thom, I emailed you the other day and have a couple questions maybe you
&gt; could help me with. I aquired a 1964 bus. It has a conversion camper kit
&gt; that has a emblem sticker that says &quot;Caravelle Camper&quot; on the side closet
&gt; door toward the rear of the van. Do you have any information on this
&gt; company? I've been looking and am unable to find anything with this
vintage.
&gt; I am trying to restore this split window conversion. The camper portion is
&gt; fine. It has a poptop and flat tilt out side windows. Three on the
&gt; driverside and two on the passenger. The vin# says it was a panel van
&gt; originally. I've checked with ASI and still think it might be a riveria,
but
&gt; not a clue. Any help? Thanks...Dennis...
