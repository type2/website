buy more fuel hose.  what is your vote for the poll?  so far, the answers
have been very one sided, and no, dodge votes don't count, but will be
presented at the conclusion of the poll.

&gt; Mine rubbed on the carb fuel solenoid and came close to wearing a hole in
&gt; itself.  The plastic was &quot;crazed&quot; around the wear spot, indicating to me
&gt; that it could have cracked easily.  Too close for me.  It only takes one,
&gt; and I don't want to be the one!
&gt; 
&gt; The other disadvantage to putting a filter in that location is that the
&gt; area over the distributor is one of the busiest locations on the engine.
&gt; It makes it harder to work on the carb, distributor, coil, brake vacuum
&gt; hose, or the filter itself.
