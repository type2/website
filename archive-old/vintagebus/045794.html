Subject: Single cab cargo door ??

Thanks to Roger Nang I have a cargo door.
But I have found out there are significant differences,
I have a 63 single cab and it has the door prop not the spring holder upper.
I believe that the spring went into use in 65.
My 63 has 3 louvres that point out, the door off the 65 in the Sacramento 
junk yard has two louvres that point in!

So I have a repairable cargo door from a 64 single cab and want a 
repairable/good door that is correct for a 63 singlecab.

Any helpers
