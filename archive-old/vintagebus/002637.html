Hey everyone,

I was down at the city dump today, and what did I find?  A totally cherry
1969 Camaro!  No rust, its totally complete, original engine, and only 1
owner!

The problem is though, I've got this brand-new 36 horse-power fire breather
sitting here in my garage not doing anything.   I would like to adapt this
engine to my new Camaro, but don't quite know how exactly yet.  The body is
in great shape, so I shouldn't need to do much reinforcement.  I've already
started cutting on it, so I'm pretty much committed to it at this point.

Has anyone else ever done this conversion?  I would be interested in hearing
about how you did it.  I would also like to see pictures of other Chevy
Camaros with VW 36hp engines in them.

Thank you,

Brian Wittling
