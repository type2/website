Subject: RE: [T2] .009, There MUST be some advantages

I've accumulated ~350,000 miles on a couple of early bay Westies, both powered with stock 1600SP engines.  The first had an old German 009 distributor, and the second has the factory original single vacuum advance distributor.  Otherwise the engines, transaxles, and tires are/were identical.

There's a big difference in the way these campers perform.  The differences are most obvious when the buses are loaded down with people or gear, and especially so when driving on steep grades with stops and restarts [the hills in downtown Seattle during rush hour come to mind].  

On a stiff grade the 009 equipped bus required much revving of the engine and a fair amount of clutch feathering/slipping just to get under way without stalling.  With the stock vacuum advance distributor you just let in the clutch and motor smoothly away.

A Type 1 engined bus with the typical light load of 1 or 2 people, driving mostly on relatively flat terrain, likely wouldn't reflect too much difference in performance between the 2 types of distributor.  But add a sizeable load and/or a steep hill and there's just no comparison.  

An 009 might be less expensive to buy than the proper vacuum advance distributor, but shortened clutch life will probably more than offset any initial savings.
