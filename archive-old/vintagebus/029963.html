I've had a full 2000lb ton of gravel in my DC as weighed by the scale at
the quarry. I could accelerate and stop OK, but it was a terrifying
ride. I had to drive through a one lane construction zone on the
interstate. All the way through I was thinking about how I would change
a tire if I got a flat. That experience convinced me that it's worth it
to pay for a dump truck to do the heavy hauling.
