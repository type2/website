yeah, i think they didn't spend alot of money 'cause they just figuerd
everything was good from the start.  DUH! don't you think it's cheaper to
test products before putting them on the market and having recall problems?
look at all the doodads they put on their 70's-early 80's cars and they
still blew up.  when was the last time you saw a '75 rabbit running around?

and yes, i am my own mechanic and that is why i don't fret.

&gt; Or do you think VW spent VERY LITTLE on this and rather realized that
their 
&gt; engines were tough enough to deal with MOST situations and did not want
to 
&gt; spend money on accessories to tell you whats going on? THEY WANTED TO
SAVE 
&gt; MONEY.
&gt; 
&gt; Now days we are running used engines, rebuilt parts, aftermarket stuff, 
&gt; crazy to intersting engine designs ETC. You do not have a factory car,
most 
&gt; likely, YOU are the tech. Do you want to know whats happening or not?
