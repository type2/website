Hell no man!  You are getting ripped off!!  I would'nt pay
anything over $149.00 for a bus in that condition.  What
does that guy think you are...a sucker??  Tell him to piss
off and go find yourself a 23 window.  They should only be
$155 or so.  Plus you get all them extra windows in the
deal...what a score!

BTW its friday.

&gt; miles on it and I'm putting
