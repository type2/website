Subject: Re:Only You Can Prevent Engine Fires 

 Hi, it was one year ago, Easter Sunday, that my '59 sc caught fire
do to a bad wire from the coil to the fuel cutoff switch on the carb.
I didn't have an extinguisher and only because of fate, the friend I=20
was visiting had a garden hose out next to the house, was I able to
save my truck.
 I've driven VWs for 15 years and never &quot;needed&quot; an extinguisher
before!  I now have one in each VW.
 Get one and check your fuel hoses AND wiring!
