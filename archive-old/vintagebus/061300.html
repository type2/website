&gt; 	Since everyone has been talking about engines lately what would

&gt; cut it with the grade and other hills I need to climb. I was thinking
&gt; something like a 1776 or 1914 dual port engine with a pict 34 or baby
&gt; dell's. Also who would be a good engine builder?

If you increase displacement and power, you also increase cooling needs.
There is a good reason that VW redesigned the type 1 engine after it maxed
out at 1600cc.  Some have built large displacement engines that last, but
it takes money and expertise to do so.  Once you're done, it takes a lot
of expertise to keep that highly tuned engine in good repair, as all the
margin for error has been used up.

If you need more power, a late model bay bus might meet your needs better.
you can go up to 2000cc with stock reliability.
