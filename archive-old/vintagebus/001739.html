Subject: [VB] Battery Size for 67 Deluxe
Message-ID: &lt;000701bf3619$3aad9540$9653113f_at_larbo&gt;

I want to replace the battery that was in my 67 Deluxe bus when I got it,
but it is obviously just something that someone threw in without regard to
the size needed.  Presumably the bus is a fairly low battery load vehicle (I
wont have all the camper stuff ready for a long time).  What size battery
were these things supposed to have?  Thanks in advance.

Larry
