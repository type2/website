hello,

     I am planning on coming out west this May or june.  I was wondering 
what show is the best one,  the classic?  If you could give me some sort of 
rough date so that i could start to plan.

     I know this is pretty early in the year to ask about shows in June but 
i figured that it would be best to start planning a little early.

    I am also interested in caravaning  with someone also, all or part of 
the way.

thanks

domonic palazzola
