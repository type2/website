Subject: I'm no longer Single... Cab
Message-Id: &lt;9907091400141U.15474_at_webd1.mail_dot_com&gt;

I sold my '54 Single Cab last night.  No, it was never advertised.

According to 2 listees I am &quot;now 50% less cool&quot; and &quot;was obviously at a point of weakness.&quot;

Immediate comments from my friends at work were &quot;Are you going to get a real car now?&quot; and &quot;You better buy something else and stop driving that Bus now.&quot; 

Direct any negative comments to my p-mail, as long as they are in jest.

Whatever,
Everett Barnes
'55 Kombi - lonely.

My web site is still cool, go visit:
