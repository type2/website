Subject: Fw: bounced messages.

I am forwarding this from Chris, can anyone help him?:

From: &quot;cdreike/Steering Man&quot; &lt;cdreike_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;
Subject: bounced messages.


 My last couple of messages were bounced back to me by the
vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com server. Can you post a message for me asking what gives?
The reply to me was complaining about spam. I don't think that I have been
particularly obtrusive. I don't make a lot of posts. I am still on the list,
just can't join in any more. This just started this evening.

 Thanks,
Chris,
The Steering Man.
