Dear Volksfolks,

Over the past few days I have sat here and read every post sent to me and
the list regarding the proposal of the BPRS.  I have tried to look at both
sides from every angle I can think of.  I have heard the good, the bad, and
the ugly.  I have seen people prognosticate the ideas eventual demise
through abuse and other underhanded ways of treachery and decete but I,
along with my cohort George Lyle have reached the following conclusions.

-The Emergency Rescue Squad WILL happen. (If it becomes a problem we will
simply kill it.)

-It will be called AIRS (Aircoooled Interstate Rescue Society). Society was
added to add an amount culture to the dang thing.  : )

-It will not involve money.

-The list will NOT be liable for any losses or lies told by those asking
for help or rendering help.

-It will be totally up to the AIRS Member how much help they render.

-It will be a link tied to the type 2 website. (if Ken hasn't changed his mind).

-George Lyle and I will play the czars and compile and make sure the data
is correct and updated properly.

-List members will be added to the AIRS database only if
they themselves request it.

-It will be for the sole use of type 2 and vintage bus list members that
are part of the database.

-It will involve folks from all over the world if those in other countries
choose to join.  (Master Seargant Brian Kautzman is serving in Italy, and he
will be one of the first.  Hooyah Sarge!)

-It will be divided up by region.

-Only those in the database will have access to the data.  We ARE
considering a delay between data input and database accessibility to
prevent abuse.

-We do need some html help to get it built. (It would be nice to make maps
that have regular grids on them as opposed to trying to do regions of
states. Amateur radio types use what are called &quot;Maidenhead Grids&quot; that
split the continental US up into about 400 rectangles about 100x50 miles.
ANYONE KNOW WHERE WE CAN GET THESE MAPS ALREADY IN HTML FORMAT???

-We will let you know when it is ready to accept registrations.  Then let
the hoards file in.

-It will only include name, phone number, and e-mail address, and location.

It is early morning so if mistakes are here I will correct them.  I have to
go and sit on  John Deere Tractor all day, and I'll bet I am the only list
member that gets to do that today.

Thanks for the input and have a groovy day.  If any of you need me write me
or call me. My phone number is (912) 379-1371.

Thanks,
Charlie Ford
