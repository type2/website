 I believe that Todd is right about the USA spec for busses and bugs, butI think '60 was the last year that semaphores were available in Europe. 
I'm fairly certain that's true for Bugs, figure Buses would probably follow suit(??).
 So...now I'm curious. Does anybody out there have a '61 Bus with semaphores?
Thanks, Dave
