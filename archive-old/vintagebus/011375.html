Recent postings to both Lists prompt me to finally write about this
issue, though I've been meaning to do so for some time...

If one has Internet access, there are several sites that incorporate a
&quot;Reverse Lookup&quot; utility available to the general public.  I use these
often to find addresses for classified ads in local newspapers, etc., so
I can decide whether or not I want to follow up on an advertised item.

The 2 I've found most accurate and useful are:

Infospace
www.infospace_dot_com

DATABASE AMERICA People Finder
www.databaseamerica_dot_com/html/gpfind.htm

On both sites, just go to the Reverse Lookup area and enter an area code
and number.  Unless a phone number is specifically &quot;unlisted&quot; you'll get
a street address to match.  At the Infospace site you can even get a map
and an E-mail address...

I use these often since our region was recently broken up into multiple
area codes (with strange and illogical borders), and it really helps a
bunch when an address is in a recently-developed area that is not yet
well mapped.

Both sites mentioned cover the USA, and Infospace's service includes FAX
numbers.  Infospace has recently expanded Reverse Lookup coverage to
Canada, has added Reverse Area Code lookup to Canada and the Caribbean,
and Reverse E-mail Lookup Worldwide.

Something else to add to your Virtual VW Toolbox......
