Subject: mirrors and panels

This question, im sure , has been asked a thousand times, but i have to ask,
where is the best place to order rubber for my 66 bus?  and what about body
panels?

the reason i ask is that ive been ordering parts from a few different
sources and your average vw parts dealer doesnt seem to know a whole lot
about pre '67 buses, and some of the specialists seem to be a little pricey.

on another note of interest , when i got my bus it had rectangle sideview
mirrors on it , with rounded corners, 5by7 inches, ive asked a few parts
dealers, all the have is round or elephant ears, did the 66 ever come with a
rectangle mirror?
