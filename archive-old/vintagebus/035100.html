Das Bulli finally called.  They for some reason had not shipped the floors
yet, wanted to know if we still wanted them.  They had not charged them to the
credit card yet either, so its not really that terrible.. They are shipping
them out, but I am still not thrilled with their customer service considering
all the emails and phone calls that fell upon deaf ears...  Come on guys, get
an answering machine or something...

Ronnie will be my source for Schofield panels from now on...
Thanks,
