SHUT YO MOUTH!

hehe...with all of this talk about interior colors I thought I'd reiterate
my plan to recreate my interior fabric. My 55 Westy came with the original
drapes, but I don't think they are the same pattern that everyone is
refering to as Yellow and Black plaid. They are more Mustard-y yellow and
khaki brown, which is cool because that will match my eventual exterior.
Most of the curtains are trashed, but I know I can piece together a good
enough swatch to be able to get a clean scan. I will color correct it,
clean it up on the computer and make it a repeating tile pattern. Then I
will take it to a service bureau and have it output on fabric that matches
the original as close as possible. I will also have it UV coated to protect
it from the sun.

Now, I don't have plans to do this really soon, but will of course keep
anyone interseted updated. Should come out pretty cool!
