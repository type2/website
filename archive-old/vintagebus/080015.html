Subject: re: bad bus day/accident

Kevin -

   Being a fellow Boston bus driver (Its been my only car this year). I know the feeling.  Someone even purposely hit me last year when they were road ragin'.. Good luck with the insurance thing... Insurance is so royally f'ed in Mass you are going to have to fight tooth &amp; nail for what $ is rightfully yours..  
	 P-mail me cause I might be able to help you find some decent used rear section that could be removed from a junk bus.
