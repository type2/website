Subject: [VB] '65 Wiper switch wiring help


&gt; Okay my next quandary is this.  I removed the wiper switch in my '65
single
&gt; cab assuming that the terminals on the switch were marked appropriately
and
&gt; reinstallation per the diagram would be easy.  Well I need to reinstall
the
&gt; switch and can't figure out which wires go where because the switch isn't
&gt; marked.  It has the little embossed circles but no numbers.  Now recently
I
&gt; bought another '65 wiper switch on ebarf because it was cheap.  This new
&gt; switch has the same 4 embossed circles but with numbers which are
(clockwise
&gt; from the top right as you look at the back of the switch) 31, 31b, 54,
54d.
&gt; 31 is a ground through the housing so there is no spade connector on this
&gt; particular location.  One of the terminals, #54, is double prong.
&gt;
&gt; There are 4 wires that went to the switch, one of which is actually 2
wires
&gt; in the same female connector which I assume to be the power from the fuse
&gt; box and lead to the interior light.  At this point I don't know the exact
&gt; colors of the wires that were connected as they were painted white when
the
&gt; interior was painted by the PO.  The Bentley diagram only shows 3 wires, 2
&gt; of which are connected to the same terminal, but no terminal numbers.  Any
&gt; ideas which wires go where?  Confused?  So am I:(
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Thomas
