Subject: Texas Insurance/Registration
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello, 
   I have recently moved to Houston, TX from Boston, MA, and still have my '65 
   Kombi insured back home. I will be here 'intermittently' for the next 2 1/2 years. I am considering changing my registration to Texas, and insuring the bus here. Some questions I have: 

   At what age does a bus no longer need to pass emission standards? 

   Does anyone in the area know where I can get the car appraised for insurance purposes. My Dad was telling me that if I get in an accident the Insurance company is going to screw me. 

   Any texans with experience getting a bus registered have any suggestions?
