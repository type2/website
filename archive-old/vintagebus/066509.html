Subject: re:accelerator push rod hole

Subject: re:accelerator push rod hole
Message-ID: &lt;GEEOKLCIPOMFKDCIKPPBIELPCKAA.kguarnotta_at_usa_dot_net&gt;

&gt; if i remember correctly the seal hear has a lip on it so that it kind of
&gt; grips the hole. ie the hole is too small by design, you need to pinch the
&gt; seal to get it too fit in.

I understand that, however my hole is so small I can only get the very top of
the seal in. If I push it in to the position it is supposed to be in, it does
not seal at all as it is folded.  Therefore I think that the hole has been cut
too small.
