Subject: Governor Vetoes Vintage License Plate Bill


Just a quick note to all of you to let you know that the Governor has vetoed
AB 2058, the Vintage License Plate bill from Assemblyman Mike Briggs
(R-Clovis).

The veto came on the second to last day of the constitutional deadline to
either sign or veto legislation. The veto action comes as a surprise, since
the bill did imposes any costs nor did it have any organized opposition.

We are still attempting to learn a reason for the Governor's action, and
will have more to say in the future.

Bill Bird
Communications Director
Assemblyman Mike Briggs
