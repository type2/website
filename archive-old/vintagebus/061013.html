Subject: NB lug bolts

I had to pull a wheel off the wifes waterbug to plug a nail hole and was
surprised to find it had lug bolts, not studs and nuts.
They looked pretty much like old ones but had an american head and perhaps
were a bit longer. I was pretty surprised,
I should have tried one on for size just to see while I had them in hand.
