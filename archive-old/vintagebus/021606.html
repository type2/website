&lt;&lt; I still have the same hesitation problem.  If I turn the distributer to 
advance the timing the engine RPM's raise and it runs smoother, and the 
hesitation is less severe. &gt;&gt;
Hi Chet,
That does sound like either you have the distributor set incorrectly or the 
advance system is not working properly.  Check out 
http://www.c-zone_dot_net/jim96003/oldvolkshome/ignition.htm  to find your exact 
distributor information and set it properly!  Then see with a tach and 
adjustable strobe light where the advance stops.  Also per VW literature the 
advance in any distributor must reach at least 20 degrees at 2,500 RPM.
