If VW disappeared in a puff of smoke *today*, what effect could it
*possibly* have on the vintage VW community, other than being a topic
for endless debate on this list and other online forums?   Let's see:

The drying up of parts sources?  Nope.  

Sudden disappearance of funding for VW events?  Nope.  

The loss of support for ACVW clubs &amp; websites?  Nope.

If anything, it would be a GOOD thing, because then all the VW sites could 
flourish unfettered without nastygrams from the law firm of Dewey, Cheatham and Howe
(actually nixon something, but you know...)

For those with a die-hard loyalty to the brand, and pledge the purchase of
NB's and NM's, there is no more link between your love of vintage VW's
and the new versions than there is between broccoli and marshmallow sauce.

The VW loyalists remind of teeny boppers who latch onto the celeb du jour,
ie n-sync, back door boys, britney spearme, etc.  Blind worship with no
real inkling what's behind the manufactured facade, yet they plaster their
rooms with posters, buy the tickets, and deck themselves out with the
appropriate licensed merchandise.  The VW loyalists swoon to anything bearing
the magic symbol.

Sure, I'm sure the NB is a great car, and the NM probably will be to, but
I feel no obligation to buy one just because I like vintage volkswagens.
As far as I'm concerned, in the new car market, VW must compete against
all of the other makers out there if they want my hard earned money; they
don't get it automatically because I have some 40 year-old VW's in my garage.
There is just as much of a tangible link between a Dodge Caravan as there is
the NM; they're both modern interpretations of an old concept.  

From an sales standpoint, VW would be just as happy if every ACVW was crushed 
and melted.  You'd have a temporary glut of cheep recycled steel; you'd have 
hundreds of thousands of people out looking for new cars, of which a certain 
percentage would buy VW's, and which would raise prices overall because of increased 
demand across the board.  And no more ACVW people pestering the service departments
for long-obsolesced parts.

This isn't your grandfather's Volkswagen...   

&gt; HELLOOOOOOO... IT IS THE YEAR 2001 and 
&gt; Volkswagen, like ANY OTHER AUTO MANUFACTURER is looking to put people in 
&gt; their cars. would you rather they not even be in business any more?
