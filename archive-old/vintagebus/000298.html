&gt; First item of business is getting all the hubcaps clips off by either
&gt;  smacking them with a chisel from the front side or center punch and drill
&gt;  from the back, then pry carefully from the front.  Next up is to get
&gt;  them either chemically stripped, &quot;wire wheeled&quot; or sandblasted.  Then
&gt;  reattach new clips with either the rivets provided, other rivets, or a
&gt;  small screw/locknut combo.

Paul, 
In my experience, it's easiest to grind off the head of the rivet and then 
punch thru with a small punch.  The best new rivets, I believe, are the 
genuine VW item.  Sorry I don't have the part number at hand.
