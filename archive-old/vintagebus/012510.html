Remember me?  Well the horse show is over and we're headed back home. I
love the Camper. It was great these last weeks.

I'll be convoying with a '69 Bus (blue),  so if you see us on the road say
hello. We will be driving I-10 to Santa Monica for a night then traveling
Interstate 5 then scoot over into Marin County, the I'll be driving I-80 to
Sacramento the rest of the way by myself. This is in California.

The whole front end has been replaced, tightened and lubed so I feel more
confident on the road. I'll tell you if Indio Dune Buggy did a good job.

Until then, see you on the road.

Peace,
Tara
