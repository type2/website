Hi Volks,
Went to our local VW FLAPS called Bow Wow today and talked to Bill about 
filter/oil pumps.  They have just gotten in a filter/oil pump from CB 
(Claudes Buggies) made by Shraeder (SP?) company that has for years made good 
quality stock and larger aftermarket oil pumps for VW.  Cost is $75.00, and 
other than needing just a little blueprinting and polishing of the oil 
passages to, and from the filter in the oil pump cover of this pump it looks 
like a real winner in the machining department.  The only wish we had about 
this pump would be that the upper gear axle had a bearing bore in the rear 
cover of this pump.  That would easily double the life of the pump over a 
normal stock pump.  Eric&amp;Barb
