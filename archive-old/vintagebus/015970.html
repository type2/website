Subject: The  8 Track saga

Hey everybody:

A few weeks ago I asked the list if anyone knew of a source for a switch 
that allowed you to switch between a in-dash radio and under-dash tape 
player. I received many good resposes.

I had called several Radio Shack stores and emailed the main office to ask 
if they still made this switch. I had given them a part number from some 
instruction I had from about 10 years ago. All of them said no. It had not 
been avaialble for years.

Well, I just received a copy of the 2000 RS catalog and (you guessed it) I 
found the switch on page 334. It is the exact same switch I had bought 10 
years ago with a new part number. Nobody at RS bothered to open up a catalog 
and look for this part. They just mindlessly punched in a part number and 
said no.

Now, after weeks of trying to figure out how to install this without that 
switch,  I can install my under-dash 8 Track the right way in the mighty 
'57.
