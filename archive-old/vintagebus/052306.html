Subject: New listee!

Hey gang,

Just to let y'all know that we have a new listee......my new daughter 
Isabella was born yesterday.  A lot of you guys see me at the shows with my 
daughter, Clara..so pretty soon there'll be two.

Obligatory bus content:

Looks like it'll be time to mount another rear seat belt for the car seat.   
Might also need a Puck or sumpin'.  The EZ is gonna be getting tight real 
quick!  Any one have any experience with 'bunk' child cots? =)

see y'all in Havasu,
look for the 63 EZ camper with the roof rack, red/white awning and grey 
single wheel trailer. I'll have one little girl for sure...maybe two!

Beto
63 EZ
Winchester, CA
