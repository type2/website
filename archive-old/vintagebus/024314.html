Subject: Front seat removal...How?

Hello all,
  Sorry in advance, if this is an old question.  Tried archives, still
can't figure out how to use the *#_at_% thing!
  I'm trying to get the front seats out of my '67 deluxe( haven't got an
owner's manual yet) so's I can try some alternatives.  Got the back
rests and passenger seat out easily, but can't figure out the trick of
the driver's seat.  Can someone please tell me how?  I looked all around
and under the seat, practically stood on my head trying to figure out
how to remove it myself!  NO LUCK!
Thanks and have a nice day.
