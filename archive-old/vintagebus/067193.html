Subject: Cargo door seals:  Dr. Seuss

Volks,

Anybody experienced with installing cargo door seals?  The door seals
themselves went in okay, but the seal around the door opening in the body
appears to be a pain.  There are four possible ways:  Right, right side out
but upside down, inside out but right side down, inside out and upside down.

The seal is one continuous square, and a bit short.  I think I have the right
side up problem solved, as there is a little wiggle in the bottom center of
the seal, where it goes around the square rods that come down into the frame
when you close the door latch.  But the inside out thing has me confused. Does
the flat part of the seal for the body go outward, towards the doors, or does
the triangular part of the seal go out toward the doors?

Also, since it is short, I take it you have to stretch.  Seems to me you have
to glue the top in securely, then the sides down to the delux trim
ridge/bulge, then stretch the rest down the sides and along the bottom?

Like Dr. Seuss, I am not sure: . . . inside, outside, upside down!

Help!
