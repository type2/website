about a portable shelter sold by COSTCO.  I am currently looking at 
purchasing one and wanted to know what others thought of them.   How well do 
they hold up?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
A neighbor of ours had bought a shelter for his new pickup a few years ago.  
About the same length as the Costco ones, but with coragated steel roofing, 
and not as tall which might have been a problem with buses.  The price was 
about $800.00.  The Costco ones we bought were about $200.00 with taxes 
(170.00), and the material used to keep the weather off of what ever you put 
under it is polystyrene.  Not a good thing to weld, or cut under due to 
flammabilty of this material.  Also this material will probably start to fall 
apart in a year or two.  So our plan is to buy corragated steel roofing at 
that time and bolt it to the frame.  Making the total cost of the structure 
about $400.00 which is still half of what our neighbor payed for a shorter 
structure.  
   As for anchoring the plastic feet provided with the kits are OK, but 
plastic will brittlize and crack over the years of exposure.  We chose 
instead to use building pier blocks with the steel brakets epoxied into the 
top of them.  Then use short head studs and nuts to bolt the legs of the 
structure to the pier block's brackets.  Lastly we drilled and bolted 1-1/2&quot; 
diameter used steel water pipe to the legs horizontally and hung cinder 
blocks of of these pipes to wiegh the structure down.  We still are 
considering putting 55 gallon drums full of crushed aluminum cans roped to 
the outside of the corners to help more with wieght, and to store our 
accumilation of cans.  We get up to 80 MPH wnds through our way on ocassion, 
and want to make sure the structure does not flail about against the VWs or 
fly off to other properties around us.  Just a little while ago we drove past 
a location that the structure had blown quite a way from where it had been 
placed.   Eric&amp;Barb
