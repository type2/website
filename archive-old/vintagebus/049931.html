Subject: Re: [VB] 6v -&gt; 12 v

&gt;Hello
&gt;
&gt;Is this a safe set up (6v starter, getting 12 v) ?
&gt;What if the engine is having a bit of problem starting, and the 6v starter
&gt;has to run ex. 10-15 seconds ?


Of course your starter will not last as long as it would in a 6v system,
and you must always be extra careful to avoid overheating it, but its life
will still be measured in years, not in months.  I would never crank the
engine for more than 30 seconds at a time, and let it cool after a few
minutes of cranking.
