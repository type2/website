I only cut the coupler, not the shift rods. I cut it end to end, like
opening up a hot dog bun. Once the coupler is completely opened up, it will
loosen and the rods will slip out.
Even if the bolts are broken off, cut through the bolt holes while grinding,
and it will pop. Don't grind any deeper than the thickness of the coupler.
The nine inch grinder just fits in there, although a 4 inch could work (and
maybe be safer). Be prepared to face pure hell at short range. When working
on a shop floor, you're face is inches away from grinder sparks. Wear every
piece of safety gear you've got, then buy more. It helps to bang on the
thing for a few days to get your attitude in the right place (Rambo like)
before starting.
New couplers are available from many after market sources.

&gt; I'm curious what you did to secure the front/rear shift rods back together
&gt; after cutting the coupler off?
&gt; Thanks.
