Hi John,
Everything used to run!  Best to call your local VW shop/engine rebuilder, 
and ask what they are paying for core engines, and offer the same to this 
fellow
  A fellow we know bought a 1968 bug that was supposedly running fine several 
years before when last parked in the POs back yard.  After paying $800.00 for 
it, and towing it to a shop he was allowed to work in, he found out that the 
#3 cylinder exhaust valve had broken off.  Resulting in not only a hole 
through the piston, but a totalled head to boot.  It probably ran fine except 
for the sounds like the death throws of a kettle drum from the back seat area.
  When we got our 1963 SC it had the original engine in it.  After fixing the 
pulled rocker stud it ran fine.  Until 50 miles later when the crank bearings 
went bad.  The engine had been rebuilt shortly before it had been parked due 
to the rocker stud problem.  Eight years later when we got it, the water, and 
acid of the old oil had rusted the crank so badly that it could not even be 
reground.  Thus the bearings got chewed to pieces by the iron oxide.
We have tried to use about five free &quot;Mystery&quot; engines since then in VWs that 
we only used locally.  That way if the engine bit it we could tow it home 
with little problem.  Out of those five engines only one lasted longer than 
200 miles.
