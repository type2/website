You guys are working hard to put those photos out and it is worth it!!!! Thanks so much. 

Some captions to explain who and whose bus we are looking at would be cool. I also hope there will be a list member group shot.

If you guys can get on the Internet from the event site you should do the irc.type2_dot_com #buslist this evening for a blow-by-blow account of the happenings.
