If I remember correctly the accelrator cable runs inside a metal tube,

Thanks Kevin! I'm still, however, a bit confused. The parts book shows 
the setup you describe in main group 1 key numbers A87, A89, A90 and 
A91, valid for up to engine H 0 085 359.

Mine is the part shown as key #A88, part #113 129 893A, for later 44bhp 
engines.
Problem is, the key shows no method for fixing the conduit to the fan 
housing. Does it lie flush against the housing, with the accel cable 
uncovered between the housing and lever arm, or does it stick out and 
cover the cable up to the end of the lever arm travel? And what holds 
it in either position? Mine currently travels back and forth with the 
cable...

TIA,
Andres
ps, any takers on the stepped cam issue?
