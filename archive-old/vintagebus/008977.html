Subject: Krazy splitty sighting
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Theres is a new music video out by &quot;Music Soulchild&quot; called&quot; just friends&quot;.
It starts out with a very nice dark blue/very light blue  two tone (66?)
camper with point bumpers drivin thru the city. Starts to show the guy layin
inside on the bed singing for about half the video. Then he picks up this
girl and she gets in. He pulls out a TV remote and clicks the button and a
huuuge  big screen TV appears where the bulkhead would be, takes up the
whole circumfrence of the bus (50 inch TV???). Theyre sittin watchin &quot;The
klumps&quot; and it flashes to the outside of the bus and it looks like theyre
gettin it on cause the bus is rockin back and forth. Then they flash back to
inside and theyre just laughin and jumpin around. Video is totally focused
on the splitty the whole time. Some shots reveal the original wooden
cabinent interior
