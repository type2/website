Yes, I was unclear, you would use the ground to case through the normally
open contact on the new sender to ground the radio, not power it. In this
manner your Lawrence Welk
gansta rap CD's would not prevent you from being aware of a critical system
failure. =^) Of course should you be listening to said fine musical
entertainment on a system with 47,000 ground-pounding watts with more than
twenty 16 inch woofers hacked into body parts all over the bus, you would
probably want to arrange this with a relay, as the sender could not handle
Sorry about that last one folks, I really gotta wake up a little more before
I start fooling with e-mail. Send means send, not get another cup of coffee
and get back to this in a minute. Sheesh. Anyway, yes, I was unclear, you

the power. The heat from the sender could cause your nipple ring to warm up,
and we all know how unpleasant that can be...

&gt;&gt;Cool Idea, but I think that sender only grounds with oil pressure and
&gt;&gt;since the radio (playing Lawrence Welk covers gangsta rap) grounds thru
&gt;&gt;the case, I think we're going to need a relay to power the radio
&gt;&gt;directly.
