There are only two people on the northern continent I would trust..one guy
lives up in Alberta canada...Scott Ross I believe...It's been quite some
time since I spoke with him, but know of several who have had him work on
their semaphores....also, he is well know to another friend of mine...Jeff
Slater.  Jeff has been restoring/rebuilding semaphores for quite some time
now.  He is at    Sema4rs_at_aol_dot_com
He restores gas heaters too.  Lives up here in the Pacific NW.  He has
built several sets for me and does incredibly good work.
