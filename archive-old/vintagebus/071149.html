Subject: ambulance identification

after a couple years of nagging, i finally bought this 1961 bus from a local
vw guy.  i am wondering if it might have originally been an ambulance.  the
original color was ivory and it came with a clear needle speedo.  the overhead
vent is missing/rotted out, so im guessing that somebody took the ambulance
fans if it did in fact have them.  my question is, did all ambulances have the
fold down rear hatch?  this one doesnt so im not sure.  its a walk thru and
the passenger side seat back has been removed, so there is no m tag.  anybody
have some ideas on how to positively identify an ambulance without the m
codes?  only ambulances were painted ivory, correct?  thanks!
