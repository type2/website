Subject: Re: [VB] body panel removal

I simply want to replace the entire driver side rear corner with the new 
panel I have. I can borrow pretty much whatever tool I need to do it from 
relatives or the local shop. I am just curious how to get the seam apart all 
the way around, what types of welds and such. It sounds like removing all 
the metal would make it alot easier.

Nathan



&gt;
&gt;Cut the corner up to about 1mm fromt he seam, and then you can drill
&gt;the welds out frm that point, without all the extra metal in the way.
&gt;Or, if you're a good welder, just section the piece you need.  Not
&gt;having seen your project (although there's a vintagebus_dot_com gallery
&gt;section just for projects!) I can't advise further.

&gt; &gt; this before so any suggestions are welcome.
