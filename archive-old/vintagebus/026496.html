I would second Paul's experience.  I am completely restoring a 73 Bug (almost
done since 1997) and have started on my Crew Cab.  I will not make the same
mistakes on the Crew that I did make (or am still making) on the Bug.  Go at it a
little at a time.  Keep in mind it took VW about 16 years to get your bus to the
point that you have it (1965 - 1949).  And you only have you to depend on, not
the technical department, marketing department, and countless others that made
the bus what it was in 1965 or even the dedicated people who make it was it is
today.  NQ, you are one of the people that has made this list interesting and a
valuable experience to me.  Stay with it and take the huge job and break it into
little pieces.  You'll see just how much work has to be done, but know exactly
what you can do in a weekend.  Go do something else to take your mind off the
darn thing.   I get to feeling like you every once in a while, but a break every
now and again does wonders for the busma.

Paul
