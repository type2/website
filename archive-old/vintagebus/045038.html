Subject: Generator question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have what i thought was a 12V 356 generator.
12V but with the smaller housing (Fits on a 36 horse case). Its got no place 
to mount a voltage regulator like 6V generators, and instead of having the 
wires come up through a hole, there are two prongs that stick up like the 12V 
ones.
On the casing it is stamped:

0 101 266 029
EG &lt;- 7V50A28

If anyone can help me name this part, I would be GREATLY apreciated.
Regards, Greg
