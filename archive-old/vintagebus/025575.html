I doubt they reduce the air intake.  By design they force air into the engine
compartment.  They could'nt help but to do that.  This is good especially if
you have air leaks in the engine compartment.  I use them on my rusty westy
only (very holy, or is that holey), as I think they look terrable on a vintage
bus.
