Subject: re;shiming cyl. orheads

i personally have stopped shimming under the cylinders unless absolutely
necessary,
i have found that using copper head gaskets is a much better way to go,
they are available in .040 and .060 thickness, so after i check my deck
height i pick the head gasket that will bring me closest to my desired
deck  height and compression ratio
my personal engine, that i transfer from vehicle to vehicle has over
10,000 miles of total abuse with no problems, except driving to the
jerome jamboree last year with a piece of paper stuck in the fan,(400
miles r/t) couldn't figure out why was overheating still made it there
and back and still have not retorqued the heads since built, sold me on
the head gaskets,
now all engines that i build i use these.
hope this information helps, call me for more info, it's
