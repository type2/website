Hi- did you realise there is more than one type 3 cooler?  The one that was 
in my westy when I got it is EXACTLY the same as the bug doghouse cooler, 
except for the sender bit.  However,  I have also seen the kind you have 
mentioned, which has more fins between the oil passages, and can see why the 
latter kind could cool better.    Maybe they made the more finned kind  for 
the later type3s?   Have also seen a type3 cooler with a plug in the sender 
place that seems like your could use a hoover bit with it.    Anyone have a 
type 3 parts list?   You really have to compare the type3 cooler to a bug one 
to see the difference (or lack of).  Sounds interesting with your experiment 
re 3 guages for the oil system, and checking with diff coolers.  Keep us 
updated.

I have a type 3 cooler on my bus, does cool better then a stock type 1

doghouse, I run a VDO temp switch in the boss(even though i don't use

gauges), the type 3 cooler has some extra aluminum plates on it that I bent

out to seal it (aka hoover bits), type 3 coolers have 30% more cooling fins

then stock type 1 coolers, all I did to clear the sender boss was cut 2

slits in the rear dog house part and bend the sheet metal up out of the way,

that way if I decide to go another way I can reweld the piece I cut back. I

have installed 3 temp sender units in my engine, I am going to install a

gauge! with a 3 way switch so I can tell the differences in oil temp taken

from different parts of the engine. 1.  dip stick sender (VDO) 2. pressure

relief screw sender (VDO) and the sender from the oil cooler (outlet side)

from this I should be able to tell where and how the oil is cooled, just

something to do. After I am done with this test I will remove the senders

and gauges. Maybe I'll install a type 4 after this and do the same thing,

(just to see how different the cooling is).
