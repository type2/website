Subject: Re: [VB] Broken needle on fuel gauge

If the gauge is basically just junk now, why not give it a try. I have
disassembled a few fuel gauges (other than VW) and have had good luck.
What's the worst that will happen? (you might break something that is
broke...)

&gt; NB the bezel isn't too happy about being pried off and then trying to put it
&gt; backon - it is apt to split/crack. IMHO it would be simpler and less stressful
&gt; too look for a good used guage for about $40.00. The needle should also prove
&gt; to be a Royal PITA to try and take off/replace.

&gt; Does anyone have any idea how to &quot;open&quot; up a fuel gauge (12 volt)?  A friend
&gt; dropped his and the needle broke.  He had just purchased it and open the box
&gt; and to the ground it fell.  Any help would be appreciated.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt; you turn it over and carefully pry up the edge of the metal that holds the
&gt; glass on the cup.  Ya the chrome, so be really careful or you'll bugger it
&gt; up.  Then the chrome bezel and glass will come off, and the gasket between
&gt; glass.bezel and the cup will come apart in a bunch of pieces and be a pain to
&gt; put back together.  Now you have the glass off, what'll you do, glue it
&gt; together?   Is this a special fuel guage?
