&gt;The question I gotta ask myself (and do ask you) is &quot;Is this a heart
&gt;breaker or is it a do-able project?&quot;  Please take a look and let me know
&gt;what you think.  

That bus looks completely doable.  Yes, the rockers are toast, but the rest
of the bus looks pretty solid and complete.  Looks like one of the better
field-finds I've seen in a long time!
