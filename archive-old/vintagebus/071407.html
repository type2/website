Subject: RE: [VB] Interesting find

&gt; Clark has made quite a name for himself turning his hobby into a very 
&gt; successful niche business selling parts for these relatively obscure 
&gt; vehicles that were killed by Ralph Nader's proclamation that they 
&gt; were &quot;unsafe at any speed.&quot;  In fact, I used him as an example when, 
&gt; many years ago, I needed to convince my wife that I wasn't completely 
&gt; off my rocker quitting my &quot;day job&quot; to turn my Bus hobby into the Bus 
&gt; Depot. 


Clark, that is, not Ralph Nader.  :-)
