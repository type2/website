&gt;Me too, but since I have a '67. That's a 67-only
&gt;block-off plate. I might as well get a set of original
&gt;safaris and mount it in one of the panes.  Sigla, of
&gt;course (also see: driver's side window needed; vintage

Do you work for a newspaper?  You're good at &quot;creative&quot;
editing.  What I originally said was:

&gt;Others have posted good ideas on where to stick it;
&gt;I like the radio-blockoff-plate idea (iff you have
&gt;an already-munged blockoff plate).

The poster that mentioned using the radio plate said
the one he had already had a hole in it, so he went
ahead and used it for the lighter.  That's why I put
the qualifier on my statement: &quot;if and only if you
have an already-munged blockoff plate&quot;.  But this
qualifier disappeared when the message was quoted...
hmm.
