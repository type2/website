&gt;I am almost done rewiring my bus.  I am wondering how to tell if I have 12 
&gt;volt wiper motor.

Can you see a part number on it?

&gt;What makes me think that it was not changed is that my wipers are still 
&gt;one speed with 3 wires going to the motor.  I have the stamped steel
&gt;setup.  My wiper switch does not have the same terminal #s that the
&gt;harness says that it should.   I have #54d blk/purple,dualtab (hot?)
&gt;#54 with domelight wire, 31b brown, and #31 with no tab at all (not
&gt;even the remenants of one).  My bus was built in Feb 65.

Sure sounds like a Beetle switch, and maybe even a Beetle wiper motor.
A '65 Bus should have had a single-speed wiper motor stock, with one
wire from the switch to the motor.  A '66 would have had a two-speed
motor, with four wires from the switch to the motor.  Most of them
would have had 53 numbers instead of 54 numbers.

Looking at the '65-'66 Bug wiring diagram, its wiper motor and switch
matches what you have more closely.  There are three wires going to
the motor and four connections at the switch: 54d black/purple to
motor, 54 hot (two black wires - one from fuse box, one to motor),
31b brown to motor, and a ground that was probably made by the nut
or screw that holds the switch to the dash, hence no tab for 31.

&gt;My replacement harness says  53blk,  53a redblk, 31b  brown.

53 and 31b make sense but I don't know where they got 53a (red/black)
from...purple/black and yellow/black are the more common striped colors
for earlier wiper motors.

I don't know if this answers the question but I hope it sheds a little
more light.
