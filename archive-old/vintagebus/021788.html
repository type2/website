what I did for safaris galss was take the old, original, cracked one down to 
a glass shop and get some cut.   Unfortunately I think the old cracked one is 
gone now, but maybe someone has one still that you could use as a template.

think a bicycle inner tube is acting as the seal between  the safari glass 
and  the original frames.

 I was trying to put together my safaris last night and realized that the
 windows I have are complete SH^T (that's all caps for a reason!).  The
 corners are all wrong and they are actually too narrow...  I'd tell you who
 made them but let's not all go there.
 
 Anyway, who makes good safari glass for original frames that IS the right
 size and shape?  Or, who has that original pair in their garage that they're
 willing to part with for a few thousand dollars. ;-)
 
 Also, I noticed that the rubber seals (WCM) stretch quite a bit and I always
 ended up with extra that could not be crammed into the rail... even though I
 soaped everything up real good.  How do you do it right?  But then again,
 maybe this happened since my glass is the wrong size.
