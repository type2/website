The Westy has elephant ears on both sides, they appear to be original
(stamped VWOA on the back)  The passenger's side arm is bent so you can use
the mirror while sitting on the driver's side, as mentioned below -- so
that's probably just the way it is.  A side note, these have held up very
well.  I really looked close to figure out if they were old original or new
repros, I couldn't tell at first glance.  Instead of buying the repros, you
may be better served to find some originals...although I don't know how hard
they are to find or expen$ive in nice condition.  If mine are originals at
all (I'm guessing the repros wouldn't have VWOA stamped on them).

Finally, I have a question about the orientation of the mirrors.  I have
seen them turned &quot;sideways,&quot; mine are mounted &quot;longways.&quot;  The VWOA is right
side up on them.  Is there a particular way these are supposed to be turned,
or is it just whatever rocks your trolley -- er, bus?

&gt; b) the elephants have both arms bent the same (driver side bend) so unless
&gt; you bend your passenger arm to match the VW round mirror arm bend, you can
&gt; only use like the outside inch of your elephant ear anyway... (and if you
&gt; bend it itll look funny as the elephant ears are so big the position
&gt; mismatch will stick out like a sore thumb)
