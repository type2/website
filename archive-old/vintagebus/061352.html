Subject: Splitty bus EZ camper windows wanted...

Recently purchased a quasi-beater '63 bench EZ Camper. It is in overall great
shape but at least two of the side windows have been permanently affixed to the
bus body via selftapping screws. 

I'd like to eventually acquire at least two of these thick framed full-sized
top hinged camper windows. Of course it would be nice to get a few in good
shape but they don't have to be perfect. Trust me, I am out of the big dollar
bus scene!

This bus is intended to be my thumper for several years. No, I am not going to
flip this one on the websites. No, I'm not all fat/phat in the wallet now that
the '67 Westy is sold. I sold that to pay previous bills. At this point I'm
surprised and lucky to even have a splittie. It looks like it will be some time
before I can get the '63 on the road. At least it's not a mandatory thing this
time. It is cleaning up nicely. A full sidewalk sized dumpster was filled from
it's interior over the weekend. It is polishing up well. =)

I will post photos of this bus on Thoms' Vintagebus gallery section for
confirmation to which windows I am referring. 

Thanks for the help,
-Ellis\
