Stephen,

I took a look at your JPG's and that is appears to
be a 1972 only case you have there.  Its hard to
tell the diameter of the cross shaft but it looks to
be of the larger style.  Do you have an early trans
that you can compare the diameter of the throw
out arms??  If it is bigger then you'll have to use 
the late pressure plate to match the late T/O 
bearing.  If it is the same size as the early style
then you're in luck.  The 1971 only cases use a 
late style T/O bearing but share the same cross
shaft diameter as the early T/O bearing.  That 
means that you can convert the arm back to the
early style and take off the late T/O bearing 
support sleeve.  Since this trans is a later IRS
that has been converted back to Swing then the
bellhousing is already 12 volts. 

Leastways thats how it looks to me........
