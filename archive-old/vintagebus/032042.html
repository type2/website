 &gt; Hi JD,
 &gt; Yup, you can by installing a 15 gallon 1968-71 bus tank with the neck cut
 off
 &gt; of a pre-1968 bus tank, hose and hose clamped onto the late tank.
 
 How does the fuel guage work with this set-up?
  &gt;&gt;
If you use a sender for the year of the tank, I believe it reads accurately.  
If you use a splitty sender, it reads empty when the first ten gallons are 
gone.  Even though there are five gallons left.  I had a 59 truck that came 
to me with (among numerous modifications including a later shift coupler that 
precluded access to reverse gear, creative wiring that precluded the 
generator from charging the battery, a dual circuit brake system, bay ball 
joint drum brake front beam, a drivers door that opened spontaneously when 
you turned right, an ignition key that worked 1/4 of the time,  and chunks of 
fulcrum plates in the tranny oil) a 15 gallon tank with a splitty sender in 
it.  it got 28 MPG with a 40hp motor, and I drove it home about 800 miles.  I 
filled up when I left, then at some podunk town in Oregon, 
and still drove around for a couple weeks before putting gas in it again.
