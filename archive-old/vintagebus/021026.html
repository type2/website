Subject: 5word contest - a1xthing?

A one time thing?

Ellis sez:
I was thrilled &lt;and over whelmed&gt; with the response to
an unplanned contest meant to spark up the list in
it's Summer doldrums. It would be unfair to foist a
contest on the list on a regular basis. 
The head-cheeses of the list &lt;admins&gt; deserve a break
and should be given the courtesy to prepare and
organize appropriately for future fun. I apologize for
not thinking of this prior to my spontaneous posting
of the &quot;rules&quot;. It was partly an experiment in
sociology to see how folks reacted to me creating
restrictions out of thin air and imposing them on the
list. &lt;Question Authority!&gt;
At this juncture, I subjugate myself to the &quot;power and
authority&quot; of the list admins. Prizes to the winners
will be sent out this weekend.
To me, a contest like that could be handled off line
to a specially dedicated address and very occasionally
too much of a good thing becomes a bore.
-In the meantime my computer is FUBAR again- vidcard
me thinks. Am accessing from work on limited basis.

A contest on a busy Holiday weekend is not a good idea
in my opinion.

I am the weakest link, -goodbye.
