Subject: Torsion Bar - offset measuring tip

Hi,

Got the four torsion bars and seals back on.

Measuring offset is frustrating. The best technique I could figure out 
was to use a metal straight ruler, and a spark plug gapper tool to fit 
between the upper torsion bar and ruler. Add up the gap blades and you 
get the space between the torsion bar and the ruler. It is much more 
exact than trying to keep a couple of rulers straight - and be within .5 
mm.

Conrad
