&lt;&lt; Quick questions volks,  are the leaf springs for '67 down front ends
 available aftermarket or used?  Just wondering.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Pete,
As far as we know you can only get them used unless you find NOS ones
somewhere.  We have one NOS that we are saving for a rainy day.  You might
want to look for low milage wrecks for good used ones.  VW used the same from
MAR 1955 to AUG 1967 and pretty sure that the 1968-1970 were the same parts.
Were the 1971-1979 the same also?  We really do not know.  Eric&amp;Barb
