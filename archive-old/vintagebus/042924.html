Subject: [VB] parting out '67 walk-through
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GHP.4.21.9912131716570.2194-100000_at_raptor.csrv.uidaho_dot_edu&gt;

I just thought I'd post this to the list to see if anyone nedded any parts
or had any ideas on what I should do.  

I have a '67 walk-through Sundial that is really parted out, but has a few
good pieces left on it.  It has a fairly tight front end, a tranny,
Sundial windows, and a couple other little things.

I'm more than likely going to cut it up, so if anybody needs any of the
parts listed above, or heck, even the whole bus, just let me know and I'll
give you a really good deal.  Did I mention it has a title?
