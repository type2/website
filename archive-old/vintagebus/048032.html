With the help of Jim Bryant it looks like We've solved the mystery of 
M-Code 195 on my '63 Double Cab: an optional sliding driver's seat.

actually, that should be standard for a 63 model (or to be exact from ch# 971
550- july 30 62).   I had found a 62 with a sliding drivers seat- which is
very unusual, and suspected that the 195 on the tag meant the sliding seat but
now i am not so sure.
