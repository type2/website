Well done.  Thanks for the post.  Nice to know things went well.

Much damage could be done to a bus with improper towing,
even on a trailer, glad none was done and that we could be of help.

Trailers are for boats, but also for preventing problems to a 
bus when the destination is the goal, not the journey.  When
the bus and you are ready, you will enjoy the journeys too.

&gt;trailered her from San Francisco, CA to Salt Lake City on a flatbed trailer

&gt;although it took 16 hours to get there!  Thanks to all who provided
&gt;trailering pointers.  Now, I just need to get there and it will be all good
&gt;- I miss her!
