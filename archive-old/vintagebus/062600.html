Subject: still not charging

OK, after some calls and a trip north I was able to get the original 
regulator and wiring from the guy I sold the ghia to.  Hooked it up, 
following the pictures and even ran a ground from the alternator to one of 
the mounting screws on the regulator.  I did not hook up the blue wire to 
the generator light, yet.  It is still not charging. Did I miss something?  
Is there any way to test the alternator or regulator?  These things cost 50+ 
new, the regulator that is.  Thanks




Bart Daugherty
