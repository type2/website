Anyone have a good way to remove the e-brake lever? I took the cables off

and the button and spring out. But how do I actually remove the whole

assembly? I tried getting the large pin out from underneath, I took the two

little fasteners off, but I'm not sure how to get the large pin out. Since

the heater channel is in the way and the steering link rod is kind of in the

way, how do I get at it???

Hey Seth, its  a real PITA to remove the ebrake lever.   Can I ask you why 
you want to suffer such self inflicted torture?    I did this once and no sir 
I didn't like it.  I think I cut the bus up and turned the front upside down 
to aid in removing that bit.  Yup you gotta remove that pin.   Try 
penetrating oil like kroil or something everyday for a week or three.  or 
grow another arm.   heat can help.
