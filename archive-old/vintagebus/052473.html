Subject: Bus interior for sale

I have a 40/60 split front seat, repro door panels, kick panel, and
headliner out of a '65 Single Cab. The panels are all the textured ones
painted grey, and the seat is grey with white piping, all original and
in great shape except drivers bottom which was recovered by WCC last
year. $300 + shipping for all of it, or I'll sell the seats and panels
separately.

I also have a &quot;flip seat for an early camper in good condition for $250
if anyone needs one.
