Subject: RE: [VB] heat duct thingys

I found that the &quot;beetle plastic accordion things&quot; unscrewed, so that I
could cut them in the middle and screw one end back on to the
&quot;accordion&quot;.  Shortening them was no problem.

So ... what have people been using to connect the heater things to the
bus
body.  My bus is a 60 so ... I've looked at the but they are too long.
I need ones about 7&quot;.  I've been using those
foil things that stretch - they work - but I'd bet that if I could get
the
beetle ones to work they would be quieter and warmer.  Ideas?
