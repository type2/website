All this talk of cab dividers has got me riled up.  Does anyone have any
pictures and/or specifications to make one?  Or someone in the Phoenix with
one I could trace?   I hate to try and squeeze a piece of ill-fitting
cardboard up in there at an attempt for a pattern.

Also, someone mentioned some felt strips or something at the top to cut down
on vibrations, could you expound on this?

How do they mount at the bottom/top?

Later,
