Another source for colored transparent lenses is the tabs
from a divider one normally would find in a three ring binder.

Several colors to choose from, cheap, different manufacturers
have slightly different colors.  Worked great for me.

------------------------------------
&gt;While I'm there with the speedo out, though, I'd really like to replace the
&gt;colored plastic bits.  Is there an easy way to get something that'll work
or
&gt;do I have to hunt?

Theatrical lighting &quot;gels&quot;.  Basically sheets of colored plastic that
don't mind sitting pretty close to a 500W light bulb.
