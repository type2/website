i had a similar problem on my bus recetnly....for some reason i couldn't go
over 50 in the bus, usually i can get up to 65 or so no problem.

with the engine idling(1600 sp 28 pict carb) if i removed the spark plug wires
to the 1st and second not much difference in engine idle...to wires to 3 or 4
caused a considerable difference in idle. Compression was fine in all
cylinder...i noticed spark plug one and 2 were awful dirty...i replaced plugs
and wires all around-made a huge difference. I think that some other adjusting
i did on the bus caused the plugs to foul pretty quickly. the bus still
doesnot feel as good as it used to...not sure what else could be wrong. but i
recommend trying to change the wires and plugs realtively inexpensive fix...
