Subject: seats for 63 deluxe

Hello All,

I am looking for a decent set of middle and rear seats for my '63 deluxe
(skirts too?).
The kick panel behind the driver/passenger partition

Also, does anyone know of a good body shop in San Diego/ Orange Co. that
could put back rear wheel wells (someone took a panel cutter to them)
and do I need to cut them from a donor car or can they be made at the
shop?

thanx,
Kamper

'63 Deluxe
'86 Westy
