 Ole Blue is hard to find. I remember one time when he made a trip around the 
world in a 1998 New Beetle. He wrote me an e-mail because I also owned one. I 
answered the e-mail with a question, and he never answered. He usta own a 
Type 34 special car, but I never got in touch with thru the Type 34 registry 
either. I asked the Type 34
list where he was, but got no response. Usually, you'll find him around some 
Rometsche (sp?), which he is a guru on. I tried to contact him about a 
Rometsche for
sale, and was unsuccessful, too. There usta be a way to get in touch with him 
thru
another fellow who did business with the Type 34 registry. But I guess that 
source is too old to list anymore, So, anyone who finds him, please notify 
the Vintagebus list.
