Great article on replacing 67 and earlier MC's with later dual circuit ones. 
One question however. I am getting ready to order the suggested 71 and later 
MC, and I can't figure out which one. I don't see one specific for 71 and 
later. And teh ones I do see, say with or without servo. Which one should I 
be looking for. I plan on ordering form busdepot_dot_com if that makes a 
difference. You did mean 71 or later bus MC right? Thanks again!
