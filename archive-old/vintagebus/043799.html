Subject: Re: [VB] 36hp help

&gt;From: D Wallace &lt;d.wallace_at_baxter508.k12.ks_dot_us&gt;

&gt;
&gt;I am wanting to rebuild a 36hp for my 59 singlecab.  [...]  As I collect 
&gt;parts how is the best way to tell if I am getting things that will be
&gt;compatable and interchangable.  Is there a parts checklist kinda thing
&gt;out there on the web for 36hp motors?

There's a couple of early Bus parts manuals online at
http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5054part.html  and
http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part.html  which may help.
The first one is a '54 edition (covers '50-'54) and the second one
is a '67 edition (covers '58-'67).  It won't give you too much in
the way of &quot;if this frob is 16 mm wide it's for a 40hp and if it's
8mm wide it's for a 36hp&quot; but it does give you the part numbers and
a few measurements.

You might already know this but the Tom Wilson engine rebuilding book
doesn't cover the 36hp at all.

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
