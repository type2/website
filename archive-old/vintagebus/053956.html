Subject: Re: [VB] Metal Practice

&gt;Air powered Diecutting tool?  Reciprocating saw with metal cutting 
&gt;blade?  Grinder with cutter?

I use all of 'em depending on what I'm cutting. Sometimes one little 
part will call for a different tool. But my personal favorite is this 
nibbler:

Take a look at one of the things I used it for on my wife's vert:

http://www.type2guy_dot_com/70/vert4.html

Wish I would have bought it sooner for sure. Would have come in much 
more handy for cutting into busses. Oh well...got it for the future 
now. And have got plenty of use out of it so far on my wife's custom 
bug vert project:

http://www.type2guy_dot_com/70/vert.html

which is what I've been up to for a while...besides still dragging 
busses home and keeping my '59 Kombi on the road as my daily 
driver...that's kept me off the list a little. Once I finish this bug 
for her, I can get back to my '59 Single Cab (I'll be collecting some 
of those parts from you soon Ronnie) and my future highway cruising 
luxury 23-window......pix are all on my website. Big plans, not 
enough time or money!!!
