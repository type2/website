Subject: Re: [VB] making a Bug engine fit a Bus with a hanger

This may be a moot point, but if you can score a Type 3 case the mounts are the same and will save you the trouble.
But then, aint that the trouble.
They're almost harder to score than Bay 1600 cases.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless

Recently someone asked about using a beetle block in a bus,, and having the hanger
bar .

If there are bosses cast into the block and not drilled out, you can drill and tap
them.

There are 3 holes, I'll refer to them as 1, 2, and 3 left to right
1 and 3 are along the same plane
2 is a little over 71mm below that

If you make a template,
draw a line 190mm long
mark hole #1 center 5mm from the left end of the line
measure 178mm along the line from hole #1 center and mark hole #3 center
scribe an arc below the line from hole #1 , 104mm
scribe an arc below the line from hole #3 , 125mm
where these arc's cross is hole #2

#1 is M10X1.5 x70 stud the hole is 22mm deep 8.5mm drill bit or 21/64&quot; worked
#2 is M8X1.25 x55 stud the hole is 28mm deep 6.8mm drill bit or 17/64&quot; worked
#3 is M10X1.5 x70 stud the hole is 28mm deep 8.5mm drill bit or 21/64&quot;
