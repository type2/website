I woke up this morning to read my mail and found six digests waiting for
me.  I'm not selling overseas, I do have a few milk crates, I do buy
from RMMW (I did notice that the last parts for my Vanagon from them had
the part numbers ground off?), and I have a few VWs as well:

1) 1967 Deluxe Sunroof, Pearl White over Velvet Green, had it since 1979
when I bought it for $300.  Restored and almost daily driver in the
summer.

2) 1967 Double Cab, originally Velvet Green, now blue (by PO) and
waiting for engine this summer.  The lady wants it in powder blue, but
I'm going back to Velvet Green.  

3) 1967 SO44 Westfalia, Pearl White, waiting for engine but all there
and pretty rusty.

4) 1964 Type 34 Ghia, bought as a basket case.  Divorce and move have
prevented work on it.  Soon, I keep saying, soon.

5) 1984 Vanagon GL, brown, daily driver with 157K on it.  Bought it new
with 35 miles on the odometer.  It's beginning to look sad, but the ex
didn't get it either!

Happy trails...
