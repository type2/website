Subject: surface rust removal...
To: spw_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

&gt; The idea i came up with was to pull it off in the grass and spot-sandblast
&gt;  the surface rust, use a metal etching prep and then prime/paint.
&gt;  
&gt;  A friend of mine said dont do that, it removes too much metal,

Steve, Split List, 

It all depends what type of abrasive you are going to use.  Since you are 
doing this in the grass, and not recycling your abrasive, I would recommend 
DuPont StarBlast.  It is cheap and not too abrasive.  I would stay away from 
black beauty. 

Unless the rust is only very very slight, a sanding disk will not work at 
removing it since rust leaves pits in the metal and a sanding disk can not 
get in the pits.  A wire cup brush/wheel will do better than a sanding disk.  
Sandblasting is the way.
