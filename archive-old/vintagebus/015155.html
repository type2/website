This was discussed ad-nauseum on the porsche 911 list.  It boiled to
to claims which couldn't be adequately substantiated.

The theory of the device was by pumping air into the plenum,
the intake system when from a state of vacuum to a state of slight 
pressurization, which supposedly improves air flow.  Along
the same lines as porting and polishing.

However; this device consumes a significant amount of
juice, and just like a supercharger (ie judson, rootes) consumes
some of the power itself.  Takes power to make power.

In addition, it's set up to only work at WOT.

that I said &quot;hi&quot;
