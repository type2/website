Subject: Westy roof rack for 65 bus

I am lookng to get a Westy style rack for my 65 Micro.  I have been
looking at the PIP repro roof rack.  Anyone have a opinion on the PIP
units?  Are they as close to original as they claim?

Also,   Does anyone know of a original (restorable) one FS?  No wood is
Ok with me.  I would rather have a origianl one but... Where and how
much??

Thanks
Matthew
