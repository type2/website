Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Starting question

&gt;This may be pedantic, but you do hit the gas a couple of times before
starting,
right?  This sets the choke and pumps a little gas in to get things fired
up.  I know, I know, all Bus drivers know this, but most of the rest of
the word has been driving fuel-injected cars for 15+ years and has forgotten.
&gt;
On my manual choke '55, that would flood the engine and prevent it from
starting.  ;)  Pull the choke out, crank engine, vroom.

Electric chokes usually require one press to the floor only, just to set
the choke at the closed position.
