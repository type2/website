Subject: rooftop tents

Since were talking tents today, here's a question that's been bugging me 
for some time.  I've got some old original VW camper ads circa 1964, 
that shows a splitty camper with a tent on the roof.  The tent is only 
accessible from climbing a ladder on the rear of the bus, and the tent
is mounted on a roof rack.  I've never seen one for sale, and never seen
one at a show, or anywhere for that matter.  Have any of you ever heard
of or seen this tent?  The ad says to get the &quot;upstairs&quot; option, you
have to get the &quot;Super De Lux&quot; kit.  I reckon not many of these were
sold.
