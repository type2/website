Subject: Engine bay door dealy

So ... just got my gas tank valve thing back together with the new package o'
stuff.  The reason I didn't think the one advertised was for my bus was
because the valve on my bus did not have a boot and I didn't know it was
supposed to have one.  In the process of re-assembling I the long tube broke
off - now that I have the reserve cable working perfectly I sure was not gonna
just put the valve in without the long tube - so I just drilled it the piece
that remained inside and put the remains of the long tube back into the valve
- now it might be 1/8&quot; shorter than it was but should still work fine - I used
a bit of permatex epoxy stuff to hold it in place - the package said it was
good for gas etc.  so ... should be OK.

Anyway - my engine bay door holder thing is broken - I know that VW (maybe in
the Bentley) recommended using a later model latch to hold the door open - but
I'd kinda like to stick with the old style - if possible.  Any one know of any
pics posted anywhere of that thing.  Mine has been broken for a while and I
kinda forget how it goes back together.

TIA
