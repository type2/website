Before I bought pnematic tools.....  I welded the correct size socket to my
Craftsman breaker bar (after I broke it over and over again) and use a long
heavy pipe as a cheater.  You also have to get a 6 foot or so piece of
channel (or other suitably shaped steel) and drill two holes that will match
up to you flywheel bolt holes.  This would be your achor to keep the motor
&gt;from turning over.  Then heave, and the nut is loose!  Works every time.
