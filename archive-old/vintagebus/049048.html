Thom,
 Following the model year logic, if you were born in the fall, you could declare your age a year younger!  And don't race horses all age a year on Jan. 1?

From E&amp;B...
&gt;The thing is you do essentially the same thing by hooking a hose to the tip 
&gt;of the bleeder valve.  Sticking the other end of this hose in a jar with a 
&gt;little brake fluid in the bottom that is enough to cover the open tip of the 
&gt;hose.  Then when you pump the pedal the old fluid with any air is pushed out 
&gt;the hose into the bottle.  When you release the pedal the hose sucks up a 
&gt;little of the old fluid, but no air.  VW has had a special bottle/tool for 
&gt;this for decades.  

You can get a plastic bottle, magnet, hoses and clamps from most FLAPS and UFLAPS. Idea is to attach it higher than the bleeder so the air bubbles flow up and purge faster. The crappy clamps won't, I use a ty-wrap to make a better friction fit.  Makes it a one person job.
 Whatever you do, don't use a beer bottle. And if you do that, don't have an audience to witness the inevitable. 

Will be putting my rebuilt engine back into the RAL2000 DoubleCab this weekend. I toasted the #2 piston and head with a plugged Dellorto on the way to Lake Havasu. Finishing up the wipers too. The bay wiper mechanism with a superbeetle motor seems to fit, I need to open one hole a tiny bit and find some o-rings  or rubber washers to seal it. Will use the stock on/off pull switch and maybe add a toggle under the dash to get 2 speeds. Full report soon. This is a '67 nose in a '62 (or '63) with the original '62 dash spliced back in. 

Seen the Sears security battery? Has a remote power lockout key-fob. Only $170 or so. For that money, I'll put in a kill switch that will let a thief burn a fuse if they hot wire it. 

Also, FS in Fresno, a very nice stock '68 single cab for $5,000.
