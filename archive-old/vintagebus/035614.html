 There was someone on the list who wanted a double-door panel,
 ostensibly for a furniture business.  Other than for decorative or
 novelty purposes, that would not make sense.  The cost to aquire,
 bring up to an operable status, and maintain such a vehicle
 does not seem cost effective for a real business - otherwise
 they'd all be doing it!  Can a VW bus compete with one of the 
 low-end small bobtail trucks popular with the light delivery
 industry?
  &gt;&gt;
I assumed that that was a VW enthisiast who used the business as an excuse to 
restore a DD panel, tax write off ya know.   And why not?  Would probably get 
light use.
