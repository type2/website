I've seen this on just about all filters.  Gas has some very volitile
components that will go to vapor at ambient temperatures.  The &quot;air
bubble&quot; you see is probably just fuel vapor.  In any case, if too much
builds up it will simply get pushed past the needle valve into the carb.

&gt; ideas?  Anyway, like someone said, as long as the carb
&gt; is full.
