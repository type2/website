Bases  (like in drain cleaners) etch glass, so its a good idea to store them 
in plastic.    in fact if you store a strong bases in a glass bottle with a 
glass stopper, it welds the stopper on.

Acids don't etch glass.

 &gt; For home storage (if you must) I suggest storage in an outside wood
 &gt; cabinet with positive ventilation.  Store acids and bases (like drain
 &gt; openers) separately in wooden cabinets.  Real acid storage cabinets are
 &gt; all wood, with no metal at all.  Even the hinges are wood.  Best bet is to
 &gt; minimize the time that you have to keep the nasty stuff around.
 
 I noticed at the home center the really caustic drain cleaners were kept
 in a plastic bottle wrapped in a plastic bag.  Could you do this at home??
