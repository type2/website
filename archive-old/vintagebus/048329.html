&lt;&lt; Hello list! I've got the engine out of my bus due to the fact I'm leaking
 alot of oil. I've decided to replace every seal I can without removing the
 heads. The engine is running great other than the leaks!
   Question #1-Should there be a seal under the nut that holds the oil filler
 to the alt. stand. Mine had one between the two; but not one on the inside.
////////////////////
these tend not to leak unless they are loose.   

.................
   Question #2-Any tips on replacing the seals on a doghouse cooler? I've
 never had one off and I think this is where alot of the oil is coming from. 
&gt;&gt;


a lot of leaks come from the oil cooler and main seals getting old.

replacing the dog house cooler seals you have to have the engine out and the 
fan housing off.-   take the two vent tin pieces off the front of the motor 
(front the way the bus drives in forward gears), undo the fan belt, undo the 
gen strap and push it so the strap is free from the gen stand, and take those 
two bolts or maybe you have screws- one at each end of the fan housing.   If 
you have the thermostat set up, you will have to remove the horizontal 
linkage and unscrew the thermostat from the vertical linkage.  if the tin 
screw through the fan shroud into the hoover bit is there, remove it.   Now 
you can lift the fan housing w/generator off the motor.

the oil cooler is on the left side of the motor- there are three nuts holding 
it on- one on top of the case very obvious, the other two hidden underneath 
the flange the cooler sits on.  those are tricky, especially if you have big 
hands.   they should be 13mm.

after you pull the three nuts, the cooler lifts right off, and you see the 
two seals between the cooler and the case?   now undo the three 10mm nuts on 
the cooler hold the cooler to the base- and you will find two more seals in 
there.   replace all 4, sometimes the inner two get missed (oops).
