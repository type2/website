Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome Jamboree XI and gas prices - Rant and Rave

Gas prices are normal here on the west coast, idiots or greedheads abound.
WARNING: You will hear a &quot;buttload&quot; of propaganda in the next few months, 
years, decades. Take everything with a grain of salt, even my suggestions! 
Check several sources. Corporate sponsored media is one source, seek 
others. http://www.zmag_dot_org/ZNET.htm is only one. Listen to a non-corporate 
radio station, www.kfcf_dot_org . Just as I examine my personal bad 
habits/actions and correct them, so should a nation. If self-scrutiny is 
blocked, question the blockers. If you're coerced or gently led to follow 
the perceived majority, it's a big warning flag. This is a nation of 
patriots, not zealots... be involved in the decisions by being completely 
informed. My bus is slowing down? I'll buy a tank of aviation fuel and that 
sumbitch'll perform, or else.  Get all the details before you make a 
patriotic choice.

&gt;We had rumors of $5.00 gas in Ohio last night which sent every one to jam
&gt;all of the gas stations in town.  This morning gas prices are
&gt;unchanged...$1.66 to $1.89.
