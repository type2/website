Martin,
Bummer to hear that!

I have dealt with Wolfgang a couple times and have been really pleased.
I have a steering gear in my 65 from them, and drove it 8000 miles on
rough roads in Mexico with no problems. It looked great, and feeels
really good.  The shop where I work has installed their bus spindles
once, and they were very nice. Nothing like what you describe.
Could it be that the spindles you got were not wolfgang?
I was just at a swap meet where California Imports had a display, and I
saw no Wolfgang parts. Although I have to admit I noticed no spindles at
all.

Give Wolfgang a call. They are great to deal with, and have always come
through for me.
