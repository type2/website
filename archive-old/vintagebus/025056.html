&gt;Quoting an old message from the archive:
&gt;&gt;Archway Imports (a parts place in St. Louis) lists in their catalog
&gt;&gt;a &quot;Solex Carb/Bushing Kit&quot; which looks from the picture to be a
&gt;&gt;drill bit, a reamer, and some bushings.  I imagine you would need a
&gt;&gt;drill press to make sure it was square.  They also sell just
&gt;&gt;bushings (8 and 3mm, where they go I know not).  The tool kit (item
&gt;&gt;# 2050) is $55, the bushings (8mm: #2051, 3mm #2052) are $2.  I
&gt;&gt;haven't used this kit, and don't even know if it's the appropriate
&gt;&gt;thing.  Archway's # is XXX-XXX-XXXX. ....

&gt;But I called and this kit is discontinued. Does anybody have a mail
&gt;order source for the reamer and the bushings for a 34-3? My wife's
&gt;bus is leaking from the accelerator pump linkage.

I don't know about the availability of the kit you refer to, but
Rimco (AKA Riddle Machine Co.) does this job for appx. $30.  Within
the last year, I posted to the archives about this (including the
address), but can't get to the archives right now for some reason.
As I recall, you have to send Rimco the stripped carb, and they
return it re-bushed fairly quickly.  Hope this helps.
