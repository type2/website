Subject: Few simple questions.

Wondering how I can change from digest to individual emails.  I found a
subscribe to digest link, but not the other.  Maybe list-manager can help ?

OTHER ... The bus at one time looked like a homeless shelter on the inside.
VW parts - seats etc - stored in the back.  When I finally cleaned it out I
had the original back seat and a newer seat, looks like one for a late 70's
bus.  The green and blue plaid .. you can see it in the pictures on my site
page www.qoam_dot_com/67bus.htm

When the mechanics were putting the bus together they installed the plaid
seats instead of the originals because it required LESS work ..but I do want
them in there.  Some sort of cross bar was installed in the back of the bus at
some point in order to use those seats.  Any way, the point is . .those seats
are in pretty perfect shape.  Is this something I should sell or toss in the
trash ?? I don't know if this is something people are in need of.

PS .. Dave W says I should post that yesterday I installed the two mirrors ..
for me it was quite a project. For others, it is probably a joke that I count
this as &quot;doing a repair on my own.&quot;  I call it &quot;repair work&quot; because of how
FILTHY on got from the dripping rust .. how hot I was.. how much effort it was
... and how hard it was to get the bolts on the old mirrors off .. Today I
will REPAIR the headlights .. installing the eyebrows .. hahaha .. Did I make
everyone laugh ?? I almost paid someone to install the mirrors .. then had a
change of mind and did it myself .. the gas station was going to charge me ..
ready for this ??? $55 for 1 hour work.  NO WAY . that $55 paid for my front
chrome emblem.
