On the advise from all on the list, I took step one this morning by looking for
the M-codes.
The old man who owned this before myself, actually lived in the bus (scary) and
he was a
welder of sorts and &quot;removed&quot; the retaining piece of metal behind the front
seats.
Hence, no M-codes.
The bus has 5 jalousie windows, one on each cargo door and three on the drivers
side
down the wall.  I am just curious as to the &quot;gender&quot; of my bus.  My guess right
now is that
it is a standard with a camper kit from Westfalia (a wannabe westy).  If anyone
can help,
please feel free to chime in.

&gt; Bryan,
&gt; Since nobody else jumped on this one, I will.  I know that Westies and
&gt; Sundials both used the crank out windows.  The way to tell the diff between
&gt; a westy and a sundial is:  Westies have a window behind the 2 cargo door
&gt; windows, and the Sundial doesn't.  The Sundials were made out of panel van,
&gt; and the windows were added by Sundial, whereas the Westies were built from
&gt; a standard bus.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps,

&gt; I just acquired a 61 ???  The question marks are what I need answered.
&gt; The bus has rather interesting &quot;jalousy&quot; windows.  I don't know if I
&gt; spelled that correctly but if anyone is familiar with these type of
&gt; &quot;wind&quot; out windows, what types of busses did these come on and what type
&gt; of bus have I purchased?  I want to call it a camper but the interior is
&gt; gutted and there are no seat (except the front ones).  Any info would
&gt; help out!
&gt; Thanks
