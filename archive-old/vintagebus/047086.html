Hi Hazetguy,
The three lug bolt puller we rented had a nice countersunk for each of the 
bus lug bolts.  This allowed the bolt to fully thread in, and then fully 
strip all the threads out of the odd third hole!  We do not like to torch 
suspension parts.  Can soften or even harden to closer to brittle point these 
parts.   Eric&amp;Barb
