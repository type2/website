I fired up the heater in the shop and tonight at 7:30, I started my chase
for the elusive matching compression ratios.  It is now 12:30a.m. and I've
spent the last 5 hours cc'ing heads and hogging the cylinders out.  I've
cc'd the chambers so many times I've lost track.

To complicate matters, I ground out too much from one head because I
misfigured what bore would be over what cylinder when the heads were swapped
side for side.  Getting over that blunder cost me another 2 hours.  The
mistake I made here was that I was doing facts and figures late last night
and that's when I goofed.  So for those of you technically inclined, here's
the whole shebang spread out on the table.

#4 Deck Height = .054 + .074 shim = .134    Chamber size = 54cc    CR for
this cylinder 6.92
#3 Deck Height = .046 + .074 shim = .126    Chamber size = 55cc    CR for
this cylinder 6.95

#2 Deck Height = .042 + .080 shim = .122    Chamber size = 54.5cc  CR for
this cylinder 6.96
#1 Deck Height = .049 + .080 shim = .129    Chamer size is = 54cc   CR for
this cylinder is 6.91

I know I listed them backwards but that's just how it comes out easier based
upon my scribbles on this notepad.  Looks like I'll be getting in touch with
the Berg man.

Let me tell you guys something.  When it comes to heads, don't buy those
affordable cheap ones.  You could have told me this until you were blue in
the face before and I wouldn't have believed you.  The money spent on heads
is well worth it because the time and money I've got tied up in these
rebuilt heads would have garnered me some nice CB Performance heads.  Some
skinned knuckles and gas money for my trips to Lincoln would have gotten me
a set of low-end Berg heads.  I'll NEVER get remanufactured heads again.
GEX heads suck and don't you guys forget that.  They are crap, low budget
pieces of junk.  They don't rebuild them - they spec them and only replace
parts if they are OUT of spec.  That means if the guides have a thousandth
or 2 of wear left, you'll get them that way.  Nice to know that you'll be
burning oil and sucking a valve within a year or 2 on your daily driver
isn't it?

Besides, GEX (via Barrett's) gave me a T1 and T3 head.  The T3 head is the
one I had to do all the hacking and grinding on.
It just isn't worth the time.  My next rebuild will sport a brand new set of
someone's heads - never again a remanufactured head - NEVER!

For those of you who have emailed me about this compression ratio stuff,
please give Jeff Martin's CR calculator a try - it has saved me a LOT of
time doing figures.  Just remember to hit the TAB key after entering a
figure to move on to the next box.
