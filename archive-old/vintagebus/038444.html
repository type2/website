Subject: FW: Jim _at_ OldVolksHome unable to reach

I started this thread on the lo list... I have an order that Jim is over a
week late (and he already charged me)... and in 6 business days he hasn't
responded to phone or e-mail.

At this point, I just want it worked out, I'm not out to burn Jim.  I just
want my (parts) problem solved.

I have an order pending, but have been unable to reach him for the last week
either via e-mail or phone to receive a status.  If anyone lives near Jim,
perhaps they should drop in and see if he is okay.
