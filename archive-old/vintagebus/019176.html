It's getting to be about time to retorque the heads, as well.  Do it
at the 1500 mile checkup, if you don't feel like pulling the engine
right now.

Curtain helps a lot, particularly if you can seal the edges relatively
well.  Insulating all the under-bus air ducting helps a lot, as well.
I'd bet you've got rust-throughs in the main duct, that are hidden by
very old, rotted out insulation wrap.  A popular replacement procedure
appears to be to cut out the old duct completely and put in a section
of PVC pipe instead.  And then insulate *that* with something that's
non-absorbent.
