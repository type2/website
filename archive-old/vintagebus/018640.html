Here's what I ended up doing:

Working with one section at a time, I first used laundry detergent
and warm water in the bathtub, getting the tent good and wet and
agitiating it by hand.  This got out a lot of the &quot;easy&quot; dirt.

I then drained the tub, and held the piece up until most of the
water had run off, then put it in the washer.  I have an upright,
&quot;industrial style&quot; washer.  I wouldn't do this in an agitator style
washer!  I put it on &quot;gentle&quot; with a light amount of soap, extra
rinse, and let it do it's thing, but I kept a close eye on it
for any strange noises.  There's a pic of this operation on my site.

After they were done, I draped them around the house.  I set up
the frame poles and put the top section on to stretch it back 
into shape.  They've been drying since Thursday.  I think I can
put them away in a couple more days.

The side pieces came out very nice, the top is a little cleaner, but
it was *really* grungy to start with.  There were also rust stains 
along the ridge line and on the edges.  Oh well; I'm just happy
to have a tent!
