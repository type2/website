Hi Shawn,
If you do go ahead and install one use trailer wire with at least four 
individually insulated colored wires inside of a rubber covering which you 
can get at most hardware stores.  Due to all the wires being inside of this 
rubber covering they look good and are double insulated against shorting out. 
 Plus if you decide to install other gauges you have the wiring from the 
engine to the dash done already.   Eric&amp;Barb
