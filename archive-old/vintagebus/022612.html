&gt;Can someone tell me what the correct decklid would be on a 57 single cab?
&gt;I've seen them in photos with and without the 3rd brakelight.  Which one is
&gt;correct?

You should have the engine lid with the flat spot for the light, but
without the light itself.

And it's not a 3rd brakelight - it's the ONLY brakelight!
