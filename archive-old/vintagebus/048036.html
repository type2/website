&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Does anyone have any experience with breather boxes?
How is it possible for an engine to develop so much pressure?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

I have a 1915cc engine in my ghia.  soon after install I noticed that I kept
blowing valve cover gaskets.  I was getting tired of putting new ones in every
day.  I went back to the engine builder....who I would not recommend.  They
said that I was building up to much crank case pressure and should have a
breather box. (duh ...why didn't they tell me this when I bought the engine?)
I installed bolt on valve covers and a breather box and it works fine.  The
only problem is the breather box leaks a little oil.  I have the small 2x2x5
box with hoses going to both valve covers and the oil filler.  Last week I was
recommended the breather box that mounts to the oil filler and sticks straight
up.  This allows the oil blown into the brather box to drip back into the
engine.  This box is more expensive though.  let me know if I can help some
more.
