I get a little metal pot of it.  at a hardware store.  just plain old 
blackjack roofing tar.  mm, I like the smell (anyone else go to La Brea  Tar 
Pits as a kid?  Before they buildt the big museum and it was a field with 
bunnys running around and a poky old museum and some statures?)  You can get 
a caulk type canister, but I dont think that is easier.   Plus in the can I 
can mix is with oil to thin it.   Also good for painting the insides of the 
front doors- the drip area where a river runs through it.
