All of this discussion of God and Type2's has reminded me: recently, it
seems, I have &quot;lost&quot; my best freind to Jesus. All he talks about now is
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Honestly, the way he talks about Jesus, you would
think the guy walked on water!!!

So, my question is. . . should I find this guy a nice type II and try to
convert him??!!!!

I think I would be saving his soul, don't ya think??
