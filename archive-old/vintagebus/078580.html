Greasy volks,

What's with these Canucks, anyway?  Winter camping?  Heated washrooms
and showers?  AND, . . . AND . . . AND, they have a national trail
that
stretches coast to coast, Vancouver, BC to somewhere on the coast in
Nova Scotia!  Limited to non-motorize vehicles and hikers.  Most of it
consistes of abandon rail beds, popularly called &quot;Rail Trails.&quot;


Why is it that the so-called &quot;greatest nation on earth&quot; can't have
such
recreational amenities and opportunitie?  Even the Aussies have such a
trail--both countries are roughly the same size as each other, 20-25
million, heck, CA has more people than that.  AND, they have a
geographcal area roughly the same size as the U.S.  (roughly)
Come to think of it, I believe the Brits have a trail like that too.

Bus content: if we had a national trail like that we'd all be bussing
to it during the spring, summer and fall, huh!

I guess in the U.S. its &quot;You play, you pay.&quot;  While in Canada and
Australia it's  &quot;We all play, we all pay.&quot;
