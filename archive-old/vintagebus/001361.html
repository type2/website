I'm working on cleaning out the bus and the garage tonight.  I ran across
some plastic paddle out of a dryer I tore apart and I saved them because
they would make some cool armrests for use in a dub.  I won't want to mess
with them but hate to throw them out.  If you think you could use them,
their yours for the price of cheap u.s. mail shipping.  You my request a
picture that I've scanned.  The paddle measures 12&quot; long, 1 and 1/8 wide, by
2.5 inches wide - just the perfect little armrest for a custom jobby.  As
funny as this all sounds, dryer paddles make an excellent basis for a set of
custom armrests.  It's called working with what you have. :-)
