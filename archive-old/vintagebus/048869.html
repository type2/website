Subject: Camper for sale in San Diego

Hello!

Got all excited today when I spotted an ad in the local paper for a 
65 camper for $2K obo.  Called the owner, and when he said that it 
was basically complete, and in OK shape, I got really excited.

Drove up to his house to see it, and was initially a little 
disappointed with the apparent condition, but then I noticed the 
passenger side sliding door.  Fool that I am, I thought I might have 
discovered some rare model, and then.....I noticed the engine air 
scoops at the top of the body.  Humm, those look like loaf scoops?

Turns out (I guess) that this is one of those deals where somebody 
had too much time on their hands and easy access to a welder.  The 
label plate on the splitty front said Type 25, but there was no 
M-code plate behind the passenger seat (which appeared to be loaf). 
The hybridizing was really done pretty well, a significant jog in the 
drip rail is the only easy clue from the side.

I'll see if I can get a picture tomorrow.
