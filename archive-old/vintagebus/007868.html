You are right on target.  I don't think the US is &quot;Lilly White&quot; in the
execution of its foreign policy but to say this is a justification for
killing thousands of innocent, unsuspecting civilians is absurd.

...and all of this is more important than any bus.  8-)

&gt; Gosh, gee, it all makes perfect sense to me now!
&gt;
&gt; America just suffered over 6000 dead and tens of billions in property
&gt; damage because... WE HAD IT COMING TO US!
&gt;
&gt; Boy, I guess that'll teach us!  Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go back to
&gt; reading my lastest issue of 'Blame America First' magazine.
