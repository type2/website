Subject: New to list, have questions
To: vintage bus list &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hello everyone,
  I am not really new to the bus list, just new
to the Vintage Bus list. I have had 4 Baywindow
Buses in the past and been hanging out on the
Baywindow list. 
  Anyway I am going to be buying a 67 camper bus
from a listee on the Bug list and wanted to
introduce myself and ask a few questions.
  The Bus as I said is a '67 camper, but it is
not a Westy, the top is a Hanover, the interior
is Gone. There are only a few beatup items left
of the old interior. The Top is real nice and I
want to keep it, so I wanted to know if there is
any place on the web I could go to find out more
about the Hanover campers. Where were they made,
what years, what type interior did they have,
that kind of thing. I checked the Library and
found nothing on the Hanover. 
  This leads me to the next question. Has anyone
build there own camper interior? Do you have any
pic's? I don't think I will be able to find any
Hanover interior parts, so I ill be building my
own and want to see some custom built stuff so I
can plan out my own. I would love to see good and
bad, so I know what to and what not to do. I'd
like to do something in a Birch or Oak
plywood(cheaper and lighter than the real stuff).
As for the sink and stove(if I use one) I will go
with modern RV store or salvage stuff.
  I will also need a rear bumper, don't need the
over riders. Are the '67's the same rear bumper
as the '68-'71? I know the brakets on the '72 are
different, but the bumper is the same as '68-71.
