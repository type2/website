Hey folks,

Trying to get my new 67 back on the road before OCTO, and I'm doing all the things you'd need to do on a bus that sat in a field for 20+ years.  I'm doing brakes, bearings, seals etc.  I've got a few questions for the experts.

First, I drained and refilled the RGB's and tranny.  Now both boxes are leaking from what looks like behind the spring plates.  Is this common for a bus that has sat for a long time?  Should I just drive it and refill it regularly or take the time and pull them apart?  What seals would be leaking?  Is it the plug on the back of the boxes?  Both stub axels have very littly play(almost none) and spin freely.  There were no chunks or filings in the drain plugs...just fine metal paste. I think they are in good condition...speedo says 87K seem about right.

Secondly, how do I remove clutch arm off the piviot shaft?  Do I need a puller?  I removed the circlip but it won't come off. While I have it off should I reinforce the arms by welding them up?

Thirdly,  Is it good insurance to replace the tranny input shaft seal?  This bus has been sitting with out a motor for years and has massive amounts of dirt in the bell housing.  The shaft and seal seem fine, but I don't want to have to take the motor out to fix something I should have done in the first place. 

Lastly, this 67 does not have back up lights.  Does that mean it is a early 67??

Steve
