&gt;&gt;Rob Braden asked:
&gt;&gt;It's a Dove Blue camper -..... I'm debating on
whether or not I should paint it like everything else, or just have it
primered and go for authenticity for authenticities sake. Opinions?


It's difficult to be definitive when talking about early Westfalia's.  Here
are some good hints. 
  
All of the 1961 and up Dove Blue Westfalia campers I've seen have the
interior completed like a passenger carrier.  Dove Blue paint covers any
interior metal surface that is not hidden behind a panel or cabinet.  In
addition the interior trim is ivory/white. The interior trim being the color
of the steering wheel and the dash knobs. 

Dove Blue Westys I've seen from earlier years are gray behind the cab and
have commercial interior trim.  A base Kombi would be gray from the cab
back. It would also have a black steering wheel, black knobs, and gray
painted hubcaps.  

One thing you can do is look at your steering wheel and interior knobs.  If
you have a black steering wheel, it would be consistent to finish the
interior like a commercial transporter.

Personally, I'd use the passenger carrier paint style and the ivory/white
interior pieces.  I like the color Dove Blue so more is &quot;more better&quot;. Also,
Dove Blue and ivory/white look great together in the cab.  It's a shame that
combination of a commercial paint color with passenger trim color was not
more widely used.        

Really anal trivia:
Even with ivory/white passenger interior trim, Westys have Kombi black wing
window latches, black windshield wiper arms, and black windshield wiper
blades.
