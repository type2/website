Just a note from one of the &quot;Large MiddleAged  Dudes With Beards&quot; at BBBV.

What a weekend!  Had a great time at BBBV, slept in the cold, just missed a 
storm leaving Albuquerque, got my photo on the front page of the Lake Havasu 
paper, won the transmission in the raffle, bid as high as possible on the 
license plate to contribute as much as I could to a fellow (how do you say 
&quot;fellow&quot; in female?) busser, and then had expensive engine noises occur 85 
miles from home!

As luck would have it, Roger Nang and I both had AAA 100 mile towing, and 
both broke down w/in the limit!  I forgot to mention that I bought a new 12V 
charger for my cell phone which didn't work, so I had to walk 1/2 mile or so 
to a phone when I broke down, but the AAA tow guy beat me back to the bus!

Got home OK, though not in time for the news so I could see what other 
disasters other than a Republican President occurred during my sojourn, but 
well in time for Jeopardy!  I'll be hard at work tomorrow investigating my 
engine problem.  At the very least, it's a bent push rod.

Great show in Havasu,

JP
