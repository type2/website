&gt; &lt;&lt; Hi - what is the consensus on the best brand of belt for my 71 dp engine
&gt;  in my 67 westr? &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Tim,
&gt; We have not heard of any bad brands.  Just so long as it is a right size it 
&gt; is fine.

Whenever I buy a correct-size belt it always ends up being made by
Continental.  Contitech seems to be the current brand name.

The trickiest part of the deal is finding the correct 9.5mm width.  10
doesn't fit well.
