Hi Jerry,
 
&gt; I'm not sure if I understand what this accomplishes?
&gt; 
&gt; Jerry

For a technical writer/help author I didn't do a very good job of that one!
By cutting the harness in the middle and joining the previously exposed ends
together one ends up with wiring that is bone stock as far as wiring colour
is concerned. Any lengths of wire that need to be added to damaged originals
are hidden in the middle where they can't freak you out.

It is highly unlikely that unless the harness had been fried that there
would be any wiring damaged or missing in the middle of the harness.

This is the sort of thing that would appeal to vintage nazis, the very cheap
and/or the completely anal. I am not a vintage nazi but I do not like the
look of the replacement wiring that I can see in my bus so I am obviously
very cheap and/or anal :-)

later 

Michael
