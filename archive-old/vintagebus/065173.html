Real springy, right?  Amazing what a little lube can do!

&gt; one quick question:what is the payload of a '65 kombi. I took about 800 lb's
&gt; of concrete the other day, bus handled well, lowered the center of gravity,
&gt; felt like I was driving a BMW.

Yeah, a BMW powered by Briggs and Stratton!  :)  I think that the load is
either 3/4 ton (1500 pounds) or 1 ton (2000 pounds) so you are well within
limits.
