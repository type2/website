&gt;I've got a fairly new engine that is running pretty wet.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone happen to remember who had the problem and
&gt;what the solution was?
&gt;


If the oil is inside the engine compartment, particularly being sprayed
around the generator, fuel pump area, it is probably being forced out the
end of the crankshaft, past the oil slinger. I had this problem, caused by
the high crankcase pressure of a large displacement engine. Better case
ventilation helped, including vented valve covers. The final solution, which
is admittedly symptomatic, was a sand-seal pulley kit. This uses an industry
standard lip type oil seal, just like on the end behind the flywheel. If
your engine is stock displacement, check the breather hose to the
air-cleaner and the road tube that comes out from the oil filler and goes
down through the sheet metal. They should both be clear and free-breathing.
If this doesn't do it, you may need to take more extreme measures to relieve
the excess pressure. The best place to vent this pressure is the intake
system, as it provides vacuum to help scavenge the pressure and it burns the
oil vapor that is drawn off. HTH
