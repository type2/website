Subject: splitty camper interior

Was writ:

&gt;  Is there an
&gt; untapped market for these sort of interiors just waiting to explode 
&gt; here in
&gt; the US, or is there actually no market for them, and I am just an 
&gt; oddball (I
&gt; know which one I would place my bets on ;-)

Richard - I've been wondering the same thing.  I took the entire camper 
interior out of my 65 Ez Camper
http://www.ezcamper.100megsfree4_dot_com/frontpage.htm  and have thought 
about making 2 or three brand new interiors to sell at swap, using the 
originals as templates.  I am definitely replacing all the beat 
originals with new birch sanded and urethaned. (sp)  The only question 
mark is the z bed hardware.  I have all the tools, skills, and desire 
to do it, but it just doesn't seem like there is any demand.  Many 
people just custom fit a bay windoe westy interior, which are currently 
still around, and work great.

My advice would be to contact your local voc/tech high school  with 
pics of a westy interior and see if the kids could take it on as a sort 
of woodworking class project.  Then everytime you drove around town, 
you'd get waves from all the kids who took part in your restoration.

If you live near me, I'd gladly build and deliver you a sweet interior
