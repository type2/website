&gt;The first is the fix-a-flat-in-a-bottle aerosol can, and it generally works 
&gt;great. It will get you from some awkward place to where you can remove the 
&gt;tyre to work on it.

If you think you might be taking the tire to a shop for fixing after
using this stuff, hang on to the empty can.  Some tire places won't
work on tires/wheels that contain an unknown type of fix-a-flat.  Some
older kinds used a flammable propellant that apparently caused much
excitement in the tire shops.  Recent fix-a-flat cans have a safer
propellant but unless you have the empty can they can't tell what
you put in the tire.  Of course, once the tire has been off the rim
and then refilled with plain old air there's no problem - it's not a
&quot;scarred for life&quot; kind of thing.  And, if you work on your own tires
anyway, you don't have to worry about it.  :)
