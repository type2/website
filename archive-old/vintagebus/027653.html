Subject: SORRY 'bout the image

Subject: [VB] OCTO Logo infringement
&gt;Does anyone know an e-mail address to someone running OCTO?  The &gt;address on the neglected (still displaying the 1999 1st annual event &gt;flyer) web site bounced back.  There is a VW club out of Nebraska using &gt;the OCTO logo  with no &quot;with permission of&quot; credit.  Would like to see &gt;if anyone is alive over at OCTO.  I'm sure they'd like to protect their &gt;artwork.

I run the Omaha VW site and have removed all traces of anything that
could be remotely offensive to the copyright cops;) Someone in our group
made up flyers for our show and I gave the images very little thought.I
don't even know what the offending image is. Not a big OCTO groupie. I
hope that everyone else that has any kind of website does a review of
their materials to protect themselves from this kind of public
humiliation. I hear that VWOA is getting tougher too. Maybe we should
set up a review committe and have people post tests of their website. 
I must say that pointing out that this is a violation of US copyright
law was a nice touch.
