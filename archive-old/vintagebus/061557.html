Subject: tranny rebuild


hello all,

I have a '67 deluxe that is popping out of fourth gear. it is time to rebuild.  As I live in wisconsin and am within driving distance to milwaukee I was thinking of using Mofoco, at only $390 I would rather have mine rebuild than swap.  does anybody have any suggestions, or better deals, or just straight info, I've been putting it off because it is such a hassle with the reduc. boxes and all. but it's time before it gets cold.
and feel free to mail me off the list with special info about mofoco.

thanks.

scott kelley
