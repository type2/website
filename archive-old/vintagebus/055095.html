Subject: Pomona, new Bus.........

------=_NextPart_001_0002_01C155D1.A7CC6280

Pomona was excellent! I saw a few listees, Uncle Jerry, Greg Noble, Ronni=
e, Kyle.... and alot of deals. I went down Saturday morning to pick up a =
new (to me) Bus in &quot;the valley&quot; then on down to Pomona. We got in Saturda=
y night at a pretty decent time, got into my spot then helped a buddy unl=
oad a car in the for sale area. We took a walk through the America sectio=
n and found tons of cool lights, racks, bikes, coolers, etc. at decent pr=
ices (1/2 of what is seen in the VW section) picjed up a few items then o=
ff to bed. Did a decent day selling had lunch then headed home.

About my new Bus. Learning from past experiences I kept my mouth shut abo=
ut this one until it was paid for and on the trailer......

What I got is a '59 LH cargo door Panel with a Westy SO-1 (sales flap) co=
nversion. I found out about it at the last Pomona and had to wait another=
 6 weeks before picking it up. But well worth it!!! This is going to be m=
y new swap meet hauler / T-shirt sales Bus. It fairly straight and rust f=
ree. I have pictures of what the interior *should* look like, but this on=
e is gutted, so now I'm on a mission for *any* info, pictures, pieces, et=
c. If any of the listees can help please let me know. I'll have some pict=
ures up of it soon.
