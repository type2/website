Subject: re: [VB] Are you raising the front of your Bus?

Duh... there are not wheel cylinders with Disk Brakes, I guess I was 
thinking of the rear.

&gt;Actually I am. I have a 60 crewcab that I am going to bring back up into 
&gt;the
&gt;light of day.  Wolfgang in Redding totally rebuilt the beam with lowered
&gt;spindles and DISK brakes, adjustable beam (you can drop it on the ground if
&gt;you wanted too :) and all new german parts, bearings, wheel cylinders,  
&gt;etc.
&gt;Only 8k miles on it since the work was done. Got to be worth $600 plus your
&gt;good beam to replace it. I prefer a beam that is correct for a 60 bus/truck
&gt;with the dampener that attaches to the frame and maybe one that is
&gt;adjustable because I want to drop it just an inch or so. This beam has the
&gt;dampener that attaches to the beam. Located in Marysville just north of
&gt;Sacramento. Email   vwbuslvr_at_saber_dot_net

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm looking to lower the front of the '63, and looking for drop spindles 
&gt;&gt;or
&gt;&gt;complete front end.. My 18 year old Son wants to drive away in the camper
&gt;&gt;this summer but wants it lowered first. The back already sags pretty good.
&gt;&gt;Anyone in Northern California looking to get rid of one?  Lloyd in Eureka,
&gt;&gt;Calif  Who wants his Son to drive away in a Splittie! Remember you never
&gt;&gt;forget your 1st car.....
