YES.  Like anything...even MIG, you'll need to practice.  If you put the
same time into practicing with a TIG as you do a MIG I'm sure you'd get
the hang of it.  You are correct, it does take a bit of coordination,
patting your head and rubbing your stomach type of thing.  They both
have their place, but for quality of welds and versatility of materials,
the TIG is far superior.
