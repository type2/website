Subject: Re: Source for correct 6v battery??
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19990314135517.0168fc50_at_pop_dot_calweb_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Anyone have leads on who carries the correctly sized 6v battery for a 66
&gt;bus?:)  that fits under the cover, and is held down by the strap?:)
&gt;
&gt;The one's I've been able to find (Advance, autozone) are the larger
&gt;version, that does not fit correctly...

Pep Boys has 2 sized, a big one and a little one.  I always use the big
one, and have forgone the cover.  The little one might work.  AZ bought
some of the Pep Boys chain tho.
