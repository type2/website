I have looked through the archives to no avail.  I know I can't be the first 
person to ask, but here it goes.

1.  Where was the Sundial Camper Factory?

2.  Were there any manuals or brochures for this conversion?

3.  I am in the process of setting of www.sundial-camper_dot_com on host pro(had 
a couple of accounts I wasn't using) a web site that will contain as much 
sundial camper info as I can find.  There are very limited resources on this 
camper.  Would anyone be interested in this?

4.  Where can I find that plastic jug that goes in the REMOVABLE water 
storage tank.

Thank you all....
