Alright, well here it goes.

I've had my engine out for quite some time now, and I was fixing to put it 
back in last night.  I thought it'd be easier to adjust the free play on the 
cluth while I had it out, so I set to it.  So I push down on the clutch 
pedal...it doesn't come back up.  I had JUST replaced the cable prior to 
taking it out, so I was a bit confused.
Anyway, I set to taking apart the front clutch assembly and greasing it up 
good (plus cleaning it up and painting it).  Now that it's greased, the 
pedal returns, but it seems a bit sluggish.  Tightening the nut at the end 
of the cable gets rid of the sluggishness, but then I don't have the inch of 
free play in the clutch pedal that I need.
The Idiot's Book talks about clutch line sag.  Where exactly is this sag 
taking place?  My cable shaft seems to be welded the the frame?  Am I 
missing something here.
Anyone care to clear up this confusion for me?
Thanks,
