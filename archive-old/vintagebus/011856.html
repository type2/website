i could go on here for hours about good and bad parts, i will be more then willing either by p-mail or phone (520)680-7664 to voice my opinon
and experience with different quality parts, you don't even want me to go into my cyl. head part
5 manufacturers in 2 different countries not counting the asian junk that trickles into this country, so thats why i didn't list it all, but my motors do last. and yes it does cost a lot to rebuild an engine right, i start at 1000.00 for a 1600 long block, but i sell a lot of oem new 1600
engines for 1315.00 just had an increase, no core outright, with a new offset oil cooler but no stand.

as far as double pulleys go every offroad shop has an assortment of different size second pulleys
that adapt onto stock pulley, these are used for power steering, oil pumps, second alt. etc. so if you want to run something else off your motor call one up tell them the diameter of your pulley
recomended rpm of your add-on and they can size a pulley to meet your needs, for a list of suppliers
of these pulleys p-mail or phone.

just about completed getting brake hardware kits 
for about every vw type 1,2,3,4 from 55 up, a couple more are on there way, will let the list know when i have all in stock, working on barndoor
kits now, also single parts, but all kits should be priced in the 8-15 dollar range
