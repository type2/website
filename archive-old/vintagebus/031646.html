Borsol and Bocar both have the tipped pumps for the long rods, I have them
both, Borosol also makes the funky looking out the top pump also, except now
they look like stainless steel inside of gold zinc. Anyway it is the Borsol
that are having the breakage problem, and it isn't due to the rod, it's
faulty manufacturing.

ooops - worked 12 hours today, and had a brain fart: it is BOCAR that makes
the generator fuel pump that is tipped like an alternator pump.
Otherwise, my message is entirely correct :)
