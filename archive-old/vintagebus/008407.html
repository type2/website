Subject: Converting to 12v

I went through the whole decision making process as to whether or not I
should run 12v or not on my bus.  After reading tons of emails and debating
with myself, I went for 12v.  I'm SO glad I did.  I can run all those
accessories like a cell phone, stereo, and all kinds of modern goodies that
really makes my bus fulfill its obligation of a good, solid, daily driver.
I would leave a bus 6v if it was a low miles, original condition bus that
had never been hacked/no rust etc. but that would be a garage queen type of
bus.  Even VW considered 12v an improvement in 1967 in split window buses.
Why not &quot;improve&quot; the older buses and update them to later VW standards?

I don't regret for one minute converting to 12v to make my bus an enjoyable
daily driver.
