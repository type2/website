I have had this sitting on my workbench for too long! NOS &quot;escutcheon&quot; that
probably fits 68-73 busses. it is the chrome doober that sits behind the
sliding door handle and in front of the sliding door. A useful item for
someone who _needs_ it.

I payed $5.00 for it but have never used it.
