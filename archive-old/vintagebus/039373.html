Subject: jalousie window seals / westy cooler

Howdy,
   I just bought some jalousie windows for my kombi.  I was looking around 
and found seals at 
http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=231069411.  Has anyone 
tried these?  I was wondering if that was all I needed in the way of seals.  
I'd also appreciate any advice or tips anyone could give on installing them. 
This weekend I hope to pick up a '67 Westy interior (minus the cooler). If 
anyone has a westy cooler/ice box/fridge laying around that they would like 
to sell, let me know. It doesn't have to be the exact year.

thanks,
Wayne Carlisle
'67 kombi
Garland, Texas
