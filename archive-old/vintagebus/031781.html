The dates for BBB V are January 19th through 21, 2001.		

For those that wish to fly in there are many List people in Pheonix that
will be comeing to the show, so that would be the best bet. This year I am
short on running buses to loan, but there  will be extras there available to
sleep in I'm sure.
