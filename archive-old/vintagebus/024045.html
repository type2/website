Hi folks - I'm getting ready to do my first tune up on my 67 westy with a 70
or 71 engine in it (AE 268791) and have a question about setting the timing
with an IGNITOR elec ignition instead of points. Can I use the static method?
I have a degreed pulley and the timing for this engine is 5 deg ATDC (right?).
Should I just follow normal procedure after skipping setting the gap? Or do I
need a strobe light?

Question 2:

The engine has an oil filter mounted to an integral cast pump cover, so it
sits to the left. I want to revert to the stock exhaust with heat exchangers
but it looks like the filter will get in the way. Is this a bad setup anyway?
it seems to be awfully close to the exhaust. Is it really helping all that
much if you change your oil regularly?

Thanks - Tim in Minneapolis
