For all who even know about the Bugfair in Spokane and might even be
planning on attending, it's this Sunday, June 24th at the Spokane
Fairgrounds.  The night before the show (Sat. June 23) from what I
understand there is going to be a gathering at Eric Carlson's shop right
on Hwy 53 in Rathdrum, ID (right outside Spokane).  This show has kinda
been going down the toilet in the past couple of years and Eric is making
an effort to rejuvenate it by having everyone hang out the night before,
tip a few back, and just BS about VWs and stuff.  So now you know.

Busless for now,
Adam &quot;Beefcake&quot; Bruno
