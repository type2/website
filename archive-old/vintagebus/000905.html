OK, tell me that I'm stupid....

I'm starting to look at what engine transaxle to put into my '59 and I found
a top end Okrasa kit containing the heads and carbs....  Would the carbs fit
in a '59?  I have talked to several people about putting a Judson in a bus
and was told there wasn't enough height so I question the carbs on this kit.
Also, anybody have any experience with Okrasa stuff?  Is waaayyyy over
priced these days?

Thanks

David
