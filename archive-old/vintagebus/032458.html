&gt;  It seems the screw on terminal headlight switch is the right one for my 59.
&gt;  
&gt;  Now since it doesn't have terminal #57, where do I hook up the little
&gt;  parking lights to make them work?

you have a euro spec switch.  You need a us spec switch to use the parking 
lights.    Try looking at some wiring diagrams and compare the US version and 
the regular (german spec) version.
