I have a 67 splitty that has a gremlin in reverse. Sometimes it works and

sometimes it does'nt. What is strange about it is that when it works,

everything seems to work fine. Good engagement and no sign of slippage. When

it does'nt, it seems that everything is working, ie., shifter and such feels

normal, but theres no go. It acts as if it is not in gear. All forward gears

work fine. Is it possible that the shift fork or the reverse gear is

slipping?

= = = == = 
first check that your shift linkage is all good.  how is the rear coupler- 
lie under the nose cone of the tranny  looking at the coupler while a friend 
moves the stick shift, see if there is wiggle between the front and the rear. 

For some reason I think 67 bus trannys are prone to having reverse go bad.
