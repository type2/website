well, i hate to burst your bubble, but it cant be done. i tried for a month 
when i got my first bus to wire up the turn signals with those $.99 12V 
relays. the problem with the dual fillament brake/turn is when you are using 
a turn signal and press the brakes.

you will get them all to work separately, but step on the brake and both 
sides will flash! its quite frustrating. give Ronnie a call, he has the 
right relays... EASY to install too! not too pricy either.
