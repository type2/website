Out of curiosity, are the ones you have the later external repro ones, are 
you talking about actually rebuilt earlier (internal) ones (65-67 style you 
need for the buses with the wiper frame assembly, though also usable on the 
earlier buses)??

&gt;  &gt; so, anybody out there need there shafts rebuilt?
