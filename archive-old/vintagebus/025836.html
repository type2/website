&gt; I'm too tired to look in the archives tonight.  I will tomorrow.  But in
&gt; the short term, can anyone give me the hot tip to getting a rear drum
&gt; unstuck from the stub axle??  I've tried liquid wrench type stuff,
&gt; heat/water/heat cycles, tapping &amp; pounding, and using a mondo US made
&gt; two arm puller my old mechanic neighbor has.
&gt;
&gt; Not even a budge!   Yes I backed the adjusters off all the way.  The
&gt; drum spins freely.  Is there anything I'm missing???
&gt;
&gt; Help.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.

Take the nut off, just leave the cotter key and drive the piss out of it!!!
Hit every bump, etc. you can find in the road. It would come off that way if
you were in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night and the nut came
loose right?? Just play it safe and leave the cotter key in too keep the drum
from falling off..........8-)
