to the grassy area...

Ellis agrees with Everett. Basically the judges as I
have observed are VVWCA members and to some percentage
members of the Phoenix based chapter of VVWCA,
Wolfburg Registry. Rick/Ann Mortensen are the
promoters of the event, members of Wolf'sb Registry
and VVWCA. All super nice people from where I stand
but the club is primarily TypeI oriented, both Vintage
and Berg-bug, and perceivably somewhat scant on the
TypeII emphasis. With the five million things that
Rick has going on he has to delegate somewhere. This
time around one of the judges was Jan Peters, PR rep
for VVWCA national, who is a very knowlegble, funny
and kind individual. The other folks who couldn't I.D.
chrome safaris on the silver singlecab as non-OEM are
beyond my insights. My take on all of the judging at
all of the shows that my wife and I have entered have
disappointed me. Generally popular opinion vs. a
Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance scrutiny. I mean
there are tons of things &quot;wrong&quot; with the 67Westy RFH
and have always admitted to it. We have won tons of
awards with the camper. Some/alot/most of them
somewhat undeserved in my mind by true concours
standards. 
At shows judged like the Mustang Gold Judging
standards or similar stds as applied to other marques
we wouldn't even come close. The lack of scrutiny plus
years of daily wear on the bus are part of the reason
why my family has pretty much opted out on showing for
competition sake. As a co-listee friend of mine says
regarding the award plaques, &quot;the Ellis' have enough
Puck trailer leveling devices.&quot; In general, I actually
prefer parking in the swaps with my buddies better.
The invitation to park on the grass was a nice offer. 
Parking on the grass? Rick asked me as a favor to drag
the beasts out for &quot;Display only&quot; to park out the
&quot;Vintage&quot; area on the grass. I had no idea what we
were getting into but appreciated the
invite/compliment and it worked out great as a super
nice day at the show. I wasn't going to turn it down
but was disappointed that there weren't more TypeIIs
in the area. I thought that there was going to be a
special TypeII display. I was looking forward to
seeing the vintage buses. I expected way more than
Jerry and Melissa's buses and ours. My family had a
great day and publically thank Rick/Ann for all of
their efforts.
Maybe it would be good to make a polite,
professionally worded, positive, non-confrontational
suggestion to the PhxBugoRama website on how the event
can continue to improve. I know that it is the
intention of the promoters to make continuous changes
for the better. The last thing they need is bashing.
It won't come from me.
Just my two cents in five hundred words or less...
