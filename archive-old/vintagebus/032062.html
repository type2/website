&lt;&lt;  All this talk about putting originals in your bus. I have 1 question for
 you all. How did you insert the original screw plate to mount the Safaris in
 your buses???? I would bet that 95% of you don't even know about this
 moveable plate that mounts the windows, you  just drill and screw, right!
 Look at a real stock Safari windshield bus with the windshields removed and
 see what I mean. If you want it original, due it CORRECT or don't do it, who
 cares about correct latches when you don't even have the CORRECT mounting
 plates? Flame me? go ahead.

funny you should say that, I have wondered the same thing.   I have seen 
people just use sheet metal screws, not machine screws where require a plate. 
 The plate is located above the top horizonatl face of the windsheild area, 
with oval holes for the side to side adjustment of the hinged windsheild.   
seems that this plate has more reinforcement and strength than sheet metal 
screws.   Also not simple to install.  Has this been a problem for anyone?
