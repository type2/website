Hi Kevin,
The Sta-Lube gear oil (AKA Tranny oil.) we use is only rated as GL-4 and is a 
80/90Wt..  Do not use GL-5!  When offered to you by knowledgable FLAPS 
employs make sure to mention that you are just too attached to you brass 
syncros to allow the high phospherous content of the GL-4 to corrode them.
