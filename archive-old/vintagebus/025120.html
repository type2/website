hey list

Just got the roof rack back - wow, it is really amazing - unbelievable -
it must look better than new because new it was galvanized now it is
zinc plated, which, IMO, looks best.

The guy at the plating place says plating is tougher that galvanizing
but ..... who knows.

Anyway, cost me the grand total of $40.00 Cdn, so that's less than
$30.00 US, unbelievable.  I sort of have a feeling that the guy that did
it for me just pocketed the $40.00 because the place that did it is this
huge industrial type place that zinc plates industrial stuff.  Too bad
they couldn't plate my bus :).

Great thing is that i really didn't have to do any cleaning or anything
- i think the process includes some sort of acid bath that eliminates
rust.

The guy i spoke to says that there is only one other place on the
Canadian praries that does zinc plating and that is in edmonton and that
they do a sh*tty job (no surprise that he would say that sort of thing)
but ..... anyway, im happy as a pig in ......
