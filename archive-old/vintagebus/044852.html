Subject: spindals
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

the threads on my left spindals steering knuckle are damaged. can these be 
fixed by taking it to a machine shop or do i have to go out and buy a rebuilt 
one. Spindals are expensive. so if anyone has any ideas to save me money and 
get my car on the road let me know.
