Subject: [VB] going to a doghouse
Message-ID: &lt;38335947.4FEAF9A4_at_silcon_dot_com&gt;

I have a busted flange on my early oil cooler on my 1600sp (engine
#B6414037).  Therefore, a replacement is in order.  I has been suggested
that I switch to a doghouse and a type 4 cooler.  I like the idea.

However, I am rather conservative, and sometimes find that modifcations
do not always deliver what one expects.

(FYI: I live in the San Fran area, and will be in +100 temps in the
central valley on occasion, and some climbs into the Sierra.)

What does the list think?  Is this modification a &quot;must do?&quot;

TIA
