    Time is running out fast for me, need to be outa my house in the next two 
weeks and still too much crap to go. Gotta westy sink/cooler for 69-71 50$ 
you pick up. Also got the under dash shelf for a bay, never got a chance to 
use it so I'm not sure what side it fits $40 which is less than I paid. I'm 
in SoCal, Riverside area 909 898 1380

    Bus stuff, got a note from the folks I sold my 70 westy to,they just got 
back from Alaska put over 10k mi with out any problems other than change oil 
and adj. valves and this on an under $3k bus keep em stock and drive the hell 
outa them
