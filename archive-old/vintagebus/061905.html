Ronnie,

I can measure &amp; blueprint that cam action for you.  One of my job duties is 
programming a sweet CNC Coordinate Measuring Machine.  Cost you a couple of 
cold ones at BBB.

Just figure out a way to get one to Prescott and back.

Another alternative is I can check my connections for a CMM in Havasu.

DPR makes the cam in a reground only, need someonre to measure it so I can
get new billets ground. Been using them for years, great gas mileage, great
power band, but no new billets
