The left hinge on my bus had broken away from the deck lid (engine lid)
and I found that the easiest way to fix the problem was to mig the
plate that had broken off back on. Any deck lid will fit but the system
that locks it up in the air will be different for the different years.

Now the sticky hinges best bet is to take them off the bus and put them
into a jar of crc for a few days just check them now and again to make
sure that they are freeing up but if this does not work then you can
try drilling them out but it is easier to find two new ones if that's
what it needs

good luck.

&gt; On my engine lid, the right side hinge has separated from the hinge...
&gt; In finding a replacement, should I be concerned about the year -- or the
&gt; fact this is a truck vs. a bus?  It does have a light over the license plate
&gt; (even works)...
&gt; I am also seeking all new hinges, both body and lid sides... someone
&gt; indicated to me that NOS ones were going for $20 a pair?
