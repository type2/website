Hi Jdd,
Wet the panels and put them inside down on clean plywood on a flat floor.  
Then place pieces of plywood with cut outs for the pocket backs to keep them 
from being crushed on top and wiegh all this down with cinder blocks or some 
other heavy spread out wieght.  Wait a couple of weeks and then check the 
panels for dryness.  Then carefully clean off the interior sides of the 
panels without getting the door sides wet.  Then liquid glycerin them to keep 
the vynil supple and not snap, crackle, pop!  You can get liquid glycerin 
from drug stores (AKA chemist store for those in the UK!) and it works to 
keep supple on all plastic, rubber, and vynil.  Should be reapplied once or 
twice a year depending on your climate.
