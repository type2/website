Hi Volks,

Rolston &lt;kuvasz_at_snet_dot_net&gt; wrote to the List:
&gt; We just picked up a long block, might be a daily driver engine for our
&gt; '65 Westy. The serial number is F0398798, can anyone tell me its
&gt; origin? thanks, Jim

That's a 1300cc SP engine, available in the Bug '65--'70 (in the US, 
'65 only).  I was pleased with each one I had (in a Bug, though), 
I doubt that it would be that great in a Bus.

Incomplete Engine Reference by Code Letter

All HP figures are DIN horsepower, maybe someone might add the SAE 
horses (and also the missing code letters, these are the European 
Type 1 engines only, plus two low-octane engines I happen to 
remember) to make a real reference out of this?

Or am I wasting my (and your) time, and such a thing exists already?  
(Probably :-)

none or A, 1200cc SP, 30 hp, old case
D, 1200cc SP, 34 hp, new case
E, 1300cc SP, 37 hp, for low-octane fuel, Bug only
F, 1300cc SP, 40 hp, Bug only
H, 1500cc SP, 44 hp
B, 1600cc SP, 47 hp
AB or AR, 1300cc DP, 44 hp, Bug only
AD or AS, 1600cc DP, 50 hp
AK, 1600cc DP, 48 hp, for low-octane fuel?

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
