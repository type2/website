Well, your '67 should have a switch on the trans, at
least if your bus has the reverse lights in the body.

This gizmo I just installed goes between the speedo
and the cable, so when you start going backwards, it
closes the switch, which lights up the light.  When
you move forward again, it opens the switch and turns
off the light.
-------------------
My '54 Barncamper has a metal tab attachment adjacent
to the rear shift coupler (nosecone coupler). When
shifted into reverse the tab on left side of
coupler/link rod assy literally pushes the switch in
the same manner that a finger would depress a switch.
A reverse light on the lefthand rear corner of the
roof then *illuminates. Shifting into fwd gear
releases the contact. The switch in my case in not
part of the nose cone and is not one of the speedo
swithes. (Just another extra that comes with the bus!)

I run a '67 nosecone on the Rancho 3.88 big nutter in
the '63. Plan on eventually mounting a rear facing big
assed driving/off-road light on the rack in the same
corner as the Ambo. Key word is eventually...

*illumination contingent upon some needed wiring fix)
