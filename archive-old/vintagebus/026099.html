One reason you may getting replies before answers is that we don't all have
our time set to the right time on our computers.  With the recent time
change, I really noticed it.  I just checked with the time lady, and
according to her, it should be... 6:02 am (EDT -5 GMT)  When are we changing
over to Universal Time? vs. Greenwich Mean Time?

Bus content - I started trying to take the remainder of the seat tracks off
the Crew, but I have not been successful.  How can I get the broken rails
off the driver's side in preparation for welding on new rails and clamps?

Also, I was told that I can fit up to an 81 Vanagon engine in the Split
without any modification.  Is this true?  I thought the latest engine
I could shoehorn into the bus without any modifications to the bus or engine
was a 79 Loaf?  What's the story?

Thanks!
