Keys?  We don't need no stinking locksmith!

The problem I have seen with making one key fit all, the groves in the
ignition do not seem to match the one's for the doors, whcih seem not to
match the one's for the rear door.
The test, if you can stick your keys in all the keyholes, then yes, you can
have one key fit all.  In my case, I can not use the same key, but stuck
with three keys (unless I change all the locks)

I can do this, take pictures... but have no website to put a faq / photos
on.

Anybody who can tune up an engine, can rekey / change the locks on their VW

&gt; This morning's exchange about VW keys has been interesting. My '67
requires
&gt; two keys, one for the ignition and most of the doors, another for the
&gt; passenger side cargo door. The engine lid has a locking latch, but no key.
&gt;
&gt; Is it possible to get them all singing in the same key? Who is the key
&gt; person to contact?

&gt; &quot;The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball. America
has
&gt; rolled by like an army of steamrollers. It's been erased like a
blackboard,
&gt; rebuilt, and erased again. But baseball has marked the time. This field,
&gt; this game, is a part of our past, Ray. It reminds us of all that once was
&gt; good, and that could be again. Oh people will come, Ray. People will most
&gt; definitely come.&quot;
