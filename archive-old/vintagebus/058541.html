Subject: Re: [VB] Has anyone noticed the continuing BFY lie?

Actually BFY is not a bad supplier. They are about 20 minutes away from me
so I have gone there a few times. They have quite a few items for Type 2's
and Type 1's. They may not have everything but they do seem to try to help.

&gt; FW: Has anyone noticed the continuing BFY lie? The
&gt; May issue of Hot VWs
&gt; arrived at my door today and I was very disappointed
&gt; to see the same BFY
&gt; ad--BFY has not had the European bus assemblies
&gt; since August (seven months)
&gt; and they continue to listing them.  How is this
&gt; different from bait and
&gt; switch advertising that every state considers
&gt; illegal?
&gt; 
&gt; I've called BFY a few times (August, November,
&gt; December, February &amp; March)
&gt; to see if they actually found some new headlight
&gt; assemblies and I get the
&gt; same answer?they sold all the assemblies quickly and
&gt; did not anticipate
&gt; getting any more.  Last month the guy on the other
&gt; end of the phone offered
&gt; a lame excuse about the difficulties of working with
&gt; his artist.
&gt; 
&gt; I've also contacted Hot VWs about this-I spoke to
&gt; someone in the advertising
&gt; department in mid-February and spoke to and wrote a
&gt; letter to the managing
&gt; editor in mid-March.  But the ad still runs.
&gt; 
&gt; Assuming that truthful advertising offers
&gt; information, product offerings,
&gt; and pricing, what value does this BFY ad offer
&gt; readers?  What does this say
&gt; about the true mission of Hot VWs?  What does this
&gt; say about BFY's business
&gt; practices?
&gt; 
&gt; I know the answer.  Both are lame.
&gt; 
&gt; Disappointed and still tilting at windmills,
