Where exactly is the ground wire that attaches to or
near the gas tank. I believe this is what is causing
my guage not to work. Additionally my high beams don't
want to switch off.  I looked for a dimmer switch on
the floor, after reading my (63-67 Bentley, $70 from
JC whitney after delivery!!!) I guess I don't have
one.  Is there a relay I need to replace or reground?
Slowly but surely I will fix everything up on the 67.
Also, can I remove the back/closer to front engine tin
w/out dropping the engine.  Ie: remove gas line and
starter bolt plus 2 egine tine screws.  Thanks for
putting up w/my LAMO questions.
