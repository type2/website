Subject: [VB] re: Swing lever kit troubles

&gt;&gt;If the opening in the beam was worn, the old bushings would have been loose
and would not have required much force to remove them. Was that indeed the
case?
&lt;&lt;

good point,
   well, they didn't fall out it seemed to require some force using the tool that bus-boys rented me (pretty cool tool even has a groove so that when you install bushings top one will protrude the required amount, thinj $20 or so to rent.
   I'm going out on a limb here and suggesting that the old bushings were worn in an &quot;out of round&quot; manner which in turn caused uneven wear on the bushing hole, if this was the case, the old bushings would still be uneasy to remove?
i hope these thoughts you Matt -
