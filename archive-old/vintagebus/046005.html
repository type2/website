For pushing pedals (brake bleeding by myself, etc.) I fashioned an adjustable 
rod by taking an old broomstick handle and a piece of one by six and drilled 
an off center hole in the one-by just bigger than the broomstick.  When you 
push the stick through the one-by and hang it on the seat front or other 
surface, the one-by tilts and it jambs the rod wherever you set it.  This 
works great for all that pushing stuff, and you don't have to find or cut a 
2x4 to the right length each time!

Hope the picture below helps.
