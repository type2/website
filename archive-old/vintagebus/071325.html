Subject: Broadway title co. update

After using this company many times in the past, i did just as usual and sent in for my latest bus
title. For those that dont know how it works, you send them a notarized bill of sale. In alabama
thats all they need so they can get it registered with that at their DMV. Then they send the
registration and bill of sale back to you and you can go down and get a title from DMV using it.
total cost, 140 bucks. Simple right? Loopholes rule.

When i got the bill of sale in the mail from them i noticed that they had changed all their
paperwork and etc. It looked alot nicer and was from a seemingly reputable company called 'Classic
Autos and Auctions' instead of &quot;joe smith&quot; or whoever it was before.. It also had a nice letter
attached to it addressed to &quot;to whom it may concern&quot; (DMV) and explained that alabama doesnt use
titles that far back etc etc to eliminate confusion.. So anyway it all looked nice and i took it
down to the DMV today. encountered trouble with the lady at the front desk when she began to argue
and all i said was 'read this' and handed her that new letter. She shut up quick and gave me my
number. Got to my official helper lady and she went thru the usuall BS going to her manager and
asking everyone in the building until she gave up and felt it was right. Everything looked good
until that one word came out of her mouth........

 &quot;Dealer&quot;

Right there i knew i was in trouble. Sure enough, 100 bucks later for DEALER TAX the lady informed
me that my city will also be sending me a letter wanting taxes as well. I questioned her and she
said cause it says Classic Autos and Auctions, that makes it dealer. WTF?!_at_ Why did Broadway title
change it? Did they do it in favor of escaping tax evasion prosecution? Anyway Im not sure if ill do
it this way anymore, I may just go for the bonded title from now on. Starting to not be worth it
anymore.
