Subject: Re: Cibie H4 headlight conversion

&gt;We found with our 1963 Sc and 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion
&gt;that even going from the stock 50/55 Watt sealed beam bulbs to 55/60
&gt;Watt H-4s that we had to go through the entire wiring system checking
&gt;for ALL voltage drops from loose, corroded, connections.

I second that.  If you want to find out just how much voltage drop you
have, there are two ways to do it.  The simplest way is to unscrew one
of the headlights from the body and let it hang by the wires.  Turn on
the headlights.  In the engine compartment, measure the voltage directly
across the battery terminals.  Then, up front, measure the voltage
directly across the prongs on the headlight.  Subtract the headlight
voltage from the battery voltage to get the drop.

The other way is to get a long piece of insulated wire of whatever gauge
you have handy.  Jumper cables work fine, as well as 24 gauge wire.
Connect one end of the long wire to the battery positive terminal, and
the other end to the positive probe of your voltmeter.  Set the
voltmeter to measure voltages of a couple of volts.  Put the negative
probe of your voltmeter to the point where you want to measure the
voltage drop - in this case, to the headlight prong.  The meter will
indicate the voltage drop directly.  This method is handy for proceeding
along a circuit, starting from the battery, to figure out where the
largest voltage drops are.

There will always be a little voltage drop.  It's the law.  However,
large voltage drops should be investigated.  Bosch suggests that in a
12 V system, there should be less than 0.3 V drop from terminal 30 on
the headlight switch to the prongs on the headlight and less than 0.6 V
drop in the complete headlight circuit.  I would halve all of these
voltages for a 6 V system.

Voltage drop is especially important for incandescent bulbs, since they
are non-linear beasts.  The stock 6012 12 V sealed beam is rated at
12.80 V on both the high and low beam filaments.  An 0.3 V drop from
this figure means the headlight is only getting 97.7% of design voltage,
which means it only gives about 90.5% of design light output.  In other
words, a 2.3% voltage drop results in a 9.5% light output drop.  (The
same 0.3 V drop on a 6006 6 V sealed beam rated at 6.20 V low and 6.10 V
high would result in about 83.6% of design light output for either
beam.)

If you want to improve the lighting without going to an H4 conversion:
The stock 6012 sealed beam is rated at 40/50 W and 20,000/27,000
candlepower.  Going to a 6014, 6015, 6016, or 4458 gets you 50/60 W and
25,000/32,000 cp.  Going to an H6026 halogen gets you 50/60 W and
28,000/32,000 cp.  Going to an H6024 halogen gets you 40/65 W and
27,000/35,000 cp.  In other words, buying the right replacement
sealed-beam can buy you up to 40% more light on low beam and up to 30%
more light on high beam.

As far as I know, nobody makes halogen 6 V sealed beams.  Maybe we
should all lean on Wagner, GE, Philips, or Sylvania until they make
some.
