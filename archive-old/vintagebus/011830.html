Subject: Why, por que? Y2K and splitties

Just returned from a doom and gloom presentation about the &quot;Why, por que&quot;
crisis. I was thankful that my buses don't have computers in them and that
they are campers. Even if I cant drive them due to lack of petrol- I can at
least live in them and stockpile canned wheat and ammo in them! =) Is it
appropriate to can hemp? Don't you try to steal my stash or I'll get you
with my loaded .420!
