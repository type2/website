Was checking my exhaust on the singlecab the other day when:
 neighbor asked &quot;how long will&quot; I &quot;have to keep massaging this thing every
day?&quot;. He don't really talk to me,but stopped long enough to say that.
Pretty silly question, fortified B.S. with little chance of good intention
behind it. I am an older college kid, he is a younger college kid(just to
let you know the grounds we are in).  I answered &quot;I don't know&quot;, but there
are so many simple answers.........anyway.  This Friday eve about 10pm I
plulled the single's 1600dp for the first time, slipped right out nicely.  I
began taking some things off and ended up retiring around 1am.  7:30 I was
back out at it. I had decided to retorque the heads for sure and actually
found one of the studs' nut was just lying next to it! I looked where the
head and cyl join, and there was a slight amount of carbon sutt. That's why
the exhaust was getting noisy! LOL.  Man, when I retorqued to 23lb, the
bottom row was extremely loose on both sides. The PO pulled the top end, but
only had the valves ground. Must have never retorqued. Then as I was taking
one of the rocker ass. off, I saw that my #3 intake valve spring is broken
near the top!   Just the last coil, and it is still seated and operational,
but I am ordering some hi revers and solid shaft on tomorrow for sure.

Point is I am glad I went through and used precuationary measures like my
gramma always told me.  These people often think it's &quot;backwards&quot; or waste
of time, but there is just no knowledge there, and they are probably too
lazy to wipe their own arse when it comes to it. I personally like not
having to wait in line waiting to pay someone to do it in a more sloppy
manor than I can do myself. Much less having to stop what I might be
enjoying on my time out of work or school because I have a rash due to not
wiping my arse and not even knowing why.........back to that line again.

I've felt this way for about 5 years about cars and most my life about other
things due to my influences and upbring as a child, but this one just tapped
me on the shoulder, because I remember not knowing anything and people like
that would silently sell their lie to me telling me I am pissing in the
wind. Now I am a strong human fed by what is  largely the truth.

By the way I told him simple,&quot;It's not a new car you know, you have to go
through these things&quot;. I think I was right and would have been so sad and
standing alone if I didn't just take the time and effort to wipe my own arse
this weekend.
