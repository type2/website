Subject: name this post

Ok,  I almost have the wiring done in the double cab thanks to a few hours
of free time Sunday morning... but when I was finishing up wiring the
flasher relay and the terminal block, I realized that the wire I got with my
wiring harness that goes to the passenger side front turn signal light is
too short.  Probably due to the fact that it is expecting a hazard relay
someplace which I don't have.  Anyway, my first reaction was to call
WireWerks up and ask for a longer black with green striped wire but then I
thought I should probably ask the list real quick to see if I could find a
*vintage* wire.  So, how 'bout it.  Anyone out there have one of these wires
left over from a re-wire job?  Richard Barker sent me his old wire harness
from his Nov. 59 panel some time ago which I've been scavenging bits and
pieces from but this wire is not there.

... I labeled this 'name this post' for all those that are now rolling their
eyes and are now confirmed believers that I've finally flipped out due to
the og wire request....
