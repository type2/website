Alan has excellent parts on most points  though i don't think all his parts
are fabbed there. The rockers and doglegs are from another source, if i'm
not mistaken, The last set of his doglegs i used fit like the normal repo's
we get here, (lousey) and i had to modify them at the seal area, as Thom has
mention he would have had to on his.
I'm presently using some of his frame rail sections on a 66 21 thats in the
shop. they fit good, but they are simple to make with the right equipment ,
which i don't have at this time (Yet). I don't have the(money) backing or
the space to implement alot of fabbing at this time but we hope to grow more
into that next year. I'm totally revamping the pages for january and will
try to have a list with pics of the parts we do make, and am presently
trying my best to aquire a bigger shop and more help. To sum it up yes i
wish some one would get his stuff and not try to gouge us on it. I'll use
alot of his parts with no complaints ,but that inner nose section in a
zillion sections , no way i refuse to use it, but i'm not going to pay some
outrageous price for something i can fab myself as good or even better, my
opinion only ,,later
