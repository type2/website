&gt; The beam would hit or pull the linkage if I dropped the beam?

Hi Sean,
Duh, no it will not and we forgot that the linkage goes over the front beam 
instead of through it.  Still without removing the front shift linkage the 
only way to do the job is to remove the front suspension from the bus.  If 
you do this it still is best to remove the front linkage at that point 
because you will have the best access to the rear end of it and can get apart 
from the rear linkage easier.  Then if you thoughly grease where the 
front/rear linkage bolts together you will be able to take it apart later to 
replace the two rubber shift tube seals, rear linkage bushings and regrease 
these.  Make a huge differance in shifting!!!
