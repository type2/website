&lt;&lt; Interesting. I thought the 200mm were larger od, but I was just assuming...
 but you dont think buses ever came with a 200mm 6v flywheel? Thats not what 
you meant is it? --  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jack,
Below is info from our 1960s bus shop manual.
211 105 271 Flywheel, 109 teeth (6 volt) - Clutch 200mm
    Used from Engine # 6 908 640 to Engine # H 0 140 935,  34bhp, 42-, 44bhp.

211 105 271 C Flywheel, 109 teeth (6 volt) - Clutch 200mm,
    Used from Engine # H 0 140 936 to Engine # H 0 183 372,  44bhp.

So the factory installed 200mm 6 volt flywheels from AUG62 to AUG66!
