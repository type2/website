Hi all,

I would appreciate your thoughts on this:

I am getting two bench seats from a '71 for my '65--the middle and rear
seats.  I really really need the rear seat, and would ultimately like the
middle seat if there's a reasonable way to make it removable (by me) when
I need it, or don't.

Can this be done?  How?

Also--this guy is going to have the bus towed after I get what I want from
it.  Now, this is a limited offer, because I am a single mom with limited
tools and $ to ship; BUT, in appreciation for all the advice I get here,
if you have a small, obscure, or hard to get part that I could possiblilty
remove and send, email me and I will TRY to accommodate.

Aloha,
Roberta
