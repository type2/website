Subject: checking out a far away bus

The following bus caught my eye -
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=598536870 
- and it has occurred to me to try to have it checked out, but I have no
real idea how to go about this.

I apologize if this is an FAQ, but any suggestions?...

Thanks very much,
Matthew Weymar
