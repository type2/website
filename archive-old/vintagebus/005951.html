&gt; I saw on the license plate thread that you can get them &quot;restored&quot; for
about $100.00 for the pair.  Does
&gt; anyone know somebody in So. Cal that can do this?  Maybe for cheaper?  I
have black and yellow plates on
&gt; my 65 and they are looking a little grungy.  Does any kind of special
paint need to be used like on the
&gt; newer plates?
&gt; Thanks for the advice.

There is a guy in Pennsylvania? that does license plate restoration.  It is
called &quot;Darryl's&quot;.  He did a friends plate off his 1933 Pierce Arrow and it
is perfect.  He advertises through Hemmings and claims to have all the
correct paint codes to match nearly all the original plate colors.  He also
offers fabrication services.  He can make a plate from scratch to match your
missing plate.  He does Pebble Beach quality resto's and he is reasonable.

He is restoring the front plate off my '63 Bus now.  The plate was in bad
shape, wrinkly and almost taco-ed.  You can see the plate in the before
condition here:

I sent the plate to him and he sent me his quote for $60.00.  With my
approval he has put the plate into his schedule.  The downside, he has a
huge back log and I am 10 weeks into an 18 week lead time.  His base service
is a repaint for about $40.00 as I recall.  Check Hemmings for the contact
info.  I will notify the list of the results when I get it back.
