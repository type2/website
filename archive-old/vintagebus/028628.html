&gt; Thank you for your interpretation, but I was not in question as to what it
&gt; meant. The original phrase of acronyms that Taylor was translating contained
&gt; the letters OG. He translated it as original, which fits into the rough
&gt; definition, but the letters OG stand for Original Gansta.

My impression when talking old VW's is Original German. Now if I was still heavy
into early Chevy's and talking about them, or if I was referring to my latest
NWA album then I think I would go with the Original Gangsta...............
But since this is a VW Bus mailing list and not the Gangsta Rap mailing list I'm
pretty sure it's safe to say OG stands for Original and or Original German
