Subject: Re: [VB] slash bumpers

Can't believe no one has responded to this one... My experience with repro
overrider stuff with OG bumpers is that you end up fine tuning the fit
with a grinder. Do it before painting and rust-proofing. There are no
rubber trim pieces that I've ever seen between the overriders/pipes and
the bumper blade. Make sure everything fits right before POR-ing and
painting. Get your bolts, etc and put it all together. The parts should
not pull into and scrape the blade when the bolts are tightened, or else
they will scratch your paint and rust up.

&gt; overriders and the bumper - any sort of rubber seal or anything.
