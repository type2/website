&gt;Here's what I've done to check it.  I've jumped across to the low and &quot;high

&gt;OK.

&gt;Anyone know the function of the other two wires running to the wiper motor.
&gt;Is 31b ( I believed that's the lettering on the switch), the brown wire on the
&gt;switch a ground of sorts.

The wire to 31b is the ground wire for the motor's park circuit, IIRC.  Not 
sure which other wire you're talking about, the other brown wire to 31 is 
for the headlight flasher.

What year bus are you working on?  Have you had a look at the wiring 
diagrams at http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/ ?

Cheers,
