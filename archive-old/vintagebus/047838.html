&gt; isnt a brand new master cylinder for a 66 and older bus about $20-25?

Yeah, we just bought one for $21 and change for our 65, but I think what E&amp;B 
are saying is that for $50 you can have a dual circuit MC that adds a bit of 
safety to the bus for a lot less than what a 67 (also dual circuited?) would 
cost. Also the guy is putting 67 beam/tranny in his 61 so he needs the dual 
circuit stuff

Right?
