&lt;&lt; Did you install a ball joint and disk brake front beam on a split window
bus?  If so what all was required.  I have a 66 DBL CAB and I was thinking
about doing this. I also want to lower the rear end, if I do that I can have 4
lug rims all the way around.

Jeremy,
I have gotten as far as installing the 69 beam with the ball joints instead of
king pins in my 67. The king pins were worn out and the cost of a beam with
new ball joints, was about the same as rebuild king pins. The front end now
rides softer than with the king pins which I think is okay. But it rides a
little higher. I plan to add the Bus Boys Albatross beam conversion when I do
the next step. I have done the research on the disc conversion and have every
intention of doing it by next summer. Since I have the 67 master cylinder with
dual circuits, I don't plan to go to the vacuum assist master cylinder unless
I find that pedal effort is excessive. I am told that it is not. If you go
with the later master cylinder it will require the vacuum reservoir and vacuum
hose to your intake manifold, and perhaps other adapters. I don't know.
The options for spindles and carriers is either 71-72 or 73-79. The later
units allow larger discs and calipers and since there are more of them in
service, the cost is less. These will require the 4 bolt wheels, cheap at any
boneyard. The initial problem with these is that if you don't do the rear end
at the same time, you need to consider carrying 2 spare tires, one with each
wheel. The 4 bolt wheels are common and are on many other cars as well
allowing a wide choice of wheel size (14 or 15 and ??16) and width. Clearance
needs to be confirmed if you go larger than stock. Rennie Webble posted a way
to use Porsche Wheels on the front a while ago using 924 hub carriers on the
73+ spindles. You can probably find it in the list archives. 
In summary to do the front requires a 68-69 beam which bolts directly to split
window bus body (and hence is hard to find). Then you need spindles with
backing plates, carriers, wheel bearings (inner and outer), discs and calipers
and pads either 71-72 or 73-79. The discs, pads and bearings likely should be
bought new from your VW FLAPS or mail order. The calipers can be bought
rebuilt at the same place. The carriers, backing plates and spindles are
boneyard parts. You will also need a pressure compensator from the later bus
(in a bone yard) because the front discs and rear drums require different
operating pressures. I am still not sure what brake lines are needed, but
these likely will be easy to be found when all else is done.
To convert the rear end to 4 bolt wheels likely will require conversion to an
IRS transmission. The best information that I have read about this in on the
BUS BOYS web page. It is easy to find with any search engine.
Good Luck and keep us posted.
