&gt; This is being posted for a friend as I would never attempt such an evil mod
&gt; on my busses ;)
&gt; 
&gt; He recently purchased a friends 1959 Goettls A/C single cab.  This is an
&gt; early 59 which should have a split case.  He needs to have it ready to drive
&gt; to Jerome as the bus hasn't been on the road in 25 years!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, he has a spare T1 tranny and is trying to figure out if he can use
&gt; that for the trip.  He already attempted the nose cone swap but it didnt
&gt; match up at all.  He is asking for suggestions and so far someone told him
&gt; (not me) that he couldd swap out the hockey stick and use the t1 nose cone to
&gt; fit it in the bus.  I dont have any clue what would work.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions?

 If you end up switching out the whole tranny, make sure that you switch the
main bearing around. otherwise you will have four reverse gears and one
foreward!. I have a bug tranny in my 66 bus. Although, it's identical to my
old one minus that bearing thing.
