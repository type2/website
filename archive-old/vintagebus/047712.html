Jason wants to know:

&lt;&lt;  Hello all. I asked a while back about how to 
make a contraption to rip the  rear end out of my 
bus and still be movable,.....

....would it be possible  to take an old pair of 
reduction boxes and cut the axle tubes off so 
that all you have is the box itself......

....Would this setup be strong enough to hold the 
whole bus up? .........
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I haven't tried that approach but I'm not sure that it
would work the best.  The springplate would flex 
somewhat and that can lead to big problems.  The
set up I have used in the past is to make a 'dummy'
trans and bolt that in.  I've not used one on a redux
box but the concept is the same.  Take an old trans
housing and install a diff with axles and tubes.  Bolt
that in place of the orginal and push the car wherever
you need to.  If it is just temporary then I use a thick
wheel bearing grease on the  bearings and the ring
and pinion set.  You don't have to hook up the brakes-
just the drum will do the trick.   Sounds like a Eric 
and Barb technology here.  Have you guys done
something like this or do you have a better mousetrap??
