&lt;&lt; you can lower it by switching away from reduction gear boxes (using 68 bug
 axles or swing axle type 3 axles, and flipping the ring gear),  this makes
the
 bus higher geared. &gt;&gt;
This also reduces the amount of bearings that support the bus and it's pay
load.  Thusly you have to expect a increase in repairing and replacing rear
wheel bearings.  We found that changes in the rear of a 1970 bus made for
replacing the rear bearing about 30,000 miles instead of every 100,000+ miles.
All due to installing big american rims with corvette sized wide tires and the
rims that had to use adapters to fit.  The adapters and wider wheels caused a
increase of leverage against the bearings which lead to short bearing life.
Changing small things can lead to big problems.

are you saying the rear wheel bearings wear quicker because of the American
rims and the funky adaptors for them, or because of the lack of reduction gear
boxes?

ya, personally I would not lower a bus, but just giving some info on how they
do it.
