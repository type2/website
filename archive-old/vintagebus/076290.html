Subject: Adhesives from May 1959

Hi All,

 

In prep to get some VW related stuff done this holiday week, I thought I
would put one of the gas tank divider plates in the double cab.  Yes, I
have found enough original felts to do one whole panel and almost the
other :-)    I was about to do this task a month or so ago but I stopped
short in realizing that I should find out what type of adhesive would be
correct.  Contact cement is what I am leaning towards.  I did a little
search on google but came up totally empty.  Accordingly, I figured I'd
ping the list and see if anyone out there could dream up a thought as to
what other type of adhesive they might of used.  I know you would all
shun me if I used the wrong stuff :-O

 

 

David
