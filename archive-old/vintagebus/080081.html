Subject: Re: [VB] correct height 15 inch modern tires

Hi Oldscholvw,
Then you want 205/75R15s.  Just make sure the max wieght rating is at least 
1525 Lbs. or better yet higher or enjoy getting blown from lane to lane by 
crosswinds on the freeways.  We are going to try Cooper 195/82R15 that are 6 ply 
for Range Rovers, next time we need tires.  They are a bit larger in diameter 
for better RPM at higher MPH, but thinner than the 205s and fit the pre-late 
1962 thinner lower wheel wells with more clearance.
