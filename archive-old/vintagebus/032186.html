completed.&gt;

Makes me feel MUch better, I had guilt trips, after 6 years my project bus
is *still*
without windows.  And, get this,  I am repainting that nice (but wrong)
paint I put
on it 4 years ago. Also redid, aham, still redoing some of my earlier work....
I feel much better now.

PS. I moved the 23 next to the house today. A very slow trip from the other
side
of my property that took 2 weeks has  come to an end. Finally!
