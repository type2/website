Subject: Re: [VB] Is this Orginal?

Only westy dormobiles got belly pans. The martin walter conversions where
just built on an average bus. You could drive your bus over and for  915
they would make it a dormobile. The sunroof standards had belly pans as
well. anything that had double doors or had a large enough hole in the roof
got them. A regular westy pop top doesn't have a large enough hole in the
roof to get pans.


&gt; The only campers I knew that should have them were dormobiles. I didn't
&gt; think just a sunroof option would get you bellypans. Wasn't sure of a
&gt; Kombi/Standard with sunroof only option, don't see them often.
