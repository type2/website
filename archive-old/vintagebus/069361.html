&gt;It is prudent to install relays with bulbs that have more draw than stock.

It sounds like you have a pretty good set-up with the relays you have on
your Bus.

&gt;I am now using the new technology blue 65/65 watt bulbs with better light
&gt;than event the 80/120 bulbs I had before.

I am assuming that you are not talking about the true HID lights, as found
on BMWs, Lincolns, etc.  They cost at least a few hundred dollars a side
and include a control box that steps up 12 V to ~80 V for these lamps.

Also, you must understand that I don't get upset about too many things in
the world of Buses.  Lowered Barndoor?  OK.  Chop the roof off of a Deluxe
and put the clip on a Kombi?  OK.  Sell your Bus to Japan?  Hey, if a
Japanese guy has the money, great.

But I hate blue incandescent headlights on any car.  Please remove these
&quot;blue&quot; bulbs from your Bus.  Now.  At best they aren't any better than
regular bulbs and at worst they are dangerous.

This site has a lot of information about blue bulbs.  Yes, this site also
has bulbs and headlamps for sale, which for some people makes the
information suspect.  My response to this was that if the guy was only
interested in making money, he'd shut up about the blue bulbs and just
sell them for twice as much as regular ones, like everyone else does.

Even some rice-boys -- the guys that will hang any kind of crap on their
car -- have concluded that blue and superwhite bulbs don't work.  The best
ones they tested were 16% worse than stock bulbs, and the worst ones were
over 50% worse.

Again, I firmly believe that non-HID &quot;blue&quot; light bulbs produce less
usable light, and more glare, than standard halogen bulbs.  I don't think
they have a place on any vehicle.
