Hi-
Thanks in advance for your input and patience...

I have successfully dropped my first engine in my '66 1600 sp.  Yay!
Pretty easy, too.  I just bought the bus, the engine rebuild was fresh,
but, I felt compelled to do so after seeing a stream of oil coming down
from the fan shroud just about at the position where the cooler is
located.

After removal and inspection, I found that one of the mounting flanges
on the cooler (the side with the single stud) was broken.  I have been
to the archives, and have not found exact answers to my questions...  so
here goes:

1) Can I be absolutely sure that this was the cause of the leak?  Why
would it crack there?
2) Any notes of caution, words of wisdom, etc., before I buy another,
and replace?  There are 3 washers/spacers that mount between the case
and cooler, correct?  2 seals...  Will these parts be included with my
cooler purchase?
3) This appears to be a good time to consider modifications to the
cooling system.  Any thoughts? (I have already referenced the type2
library).  I live in the SF Bay Area, moderate temps, but the occasional
trip to the Sierra through the Central Valley can be above 100degrees.
4) The cylinders OPPOSITE the cooler are pretty dirty, and I can imagine
this crud might diminish the efficacy of the cooling system.  Any advice
on the best way to clean that area?
5) Should the relief valve assembly also be replaced?
6) Finally, I am considering options to decrease the noise coming from
the engine.  Has anyone tried insulating the engine compartment with
success?  Will this make the engine too hot?
7) My upper engine mounting bolts are held in the trans case by what
appears to be a silcon material.  It barley holds the blot in place on
the left side.  Any suggestions to keep it in place?
8) Anything else I should evaluate, maintenance I should perform or
modifications to consider while the engine is out?  I know it's easy to
remove, but, I would prefer not to do it every month!

Thanks ever so much for all the help.
Best regards,
Mark
