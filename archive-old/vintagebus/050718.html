Subject: Re: [VB] VW ads in 1963 newspaper

&gt;From: I973Thing_at_aol_dot_com
&gt;Date: Tue, 12 Feb 2002 16:47:59 EST
&gt;
&gt;Today I acquired a newspaper dated November 22, 1963.

My Bus (13 November 1963) was probably on a boat headed for 
San Fransisco then.  

From http://www.westegg_dot_com/inflation/ , from 1963 to 2001, rounded:

&gt;1958 Volkswagen, black, sun roof, radio, asking  $695.   call RE-36544

$3900

&gt;1962 Karmann Ghia coupe, ebony black, white walls, white top, radio, 
&gt;   like new, asking  $1795.

$10,100
     
&gt;1963 Volkswagen sedan, executive car, low miles,  $1545.

$8,700

&gt;1961 Micro Station wagon, great in every respect,  $1395.

$7,900

&gt;1958 Volkswagen Micro Station Wagon, completely reconditioned,  $895   
&gt;    Call RE-91126

$5,000

So, have you called anybody to see if they still have the car?  There
is a listing for at least one of those numbers...

For more recent VW ads, I saw an ad during the Olympics on NBC earlier
this week.  Briefly, it showed line drawings of people standing around
a Beetle, then a splittie, then a late-model Jetta, then a New Beetle.
The last scene shows people standing looking down a road, presumably
at the next vehicle from VW.

I don't remember if the Bus was a Deluxe or what, but I do remember
that it had the later turn signals.  I think the Beetle had a big
rear window, too.  For some reason, the logo on the front of the Bus
wasn't fuzzed out.
