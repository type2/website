Subject: '73 Camper Free Sacramento Area

Please forward this on to the loaf list.

Grass Valley actually, 30 miles east of Sacramento.

Spotted this in the local paper, free section.

'73 VW Camper Van, Needs engine.  530-639-0425

That's all I know about this bus.

I will loan the use of my bus tow bar for anyone
who wants this bus.


For anyone even more adventurous, I know of a
'64 Ford Falcon window van for $10, needs an
engine, but this deal includes a '78 Granada
just for that purpose.  The Granada even runs.
The van is in really good condition, wish I
could get it, but no projects for now.

Gotta act really fast on the Ford van, the owner
is moving and the landlord wants the van gone.

Call me at 530-268-3748 for the Ford or towbar
after you strike a deal on the VW.

Jeff  no bus anymore, but I got a tow bar!
