&gt;  As for the lighter, it
&gt; should be located(at least on my 65 standard)just to
&gt; the left of the wiper switch on the dash.

hrrmm.... mine is just under the ash tray on the top of the dash.  centered
and everything.  Looks original actually... but I don' think the factory did
it.  The lighter says Cosco or something like that...not Costco though..
Its 12V so it may be a replacement lighter...but it looks old.. 6V would
still heat it up though.
