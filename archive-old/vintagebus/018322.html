It's hit or miss.  One time I ordered bumpers, I got the big ones,
the next time I got the small ones.  The small ones are JUNK! -
in case you missed it... JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK!

Jim Thompson of Old Volks Home (where did ever make off to?) had some nice big-style ones
at a show one time, along with REAL hubcap clips, and I just about cleaned
out his inventory.  You might try to run him down and see if he still
has any.  Between the '55 and '60 DD, I don't think I have any more...

The bumpers that were on my '60 and my '55 more closely matched the *big* bumpers.

&gt; This door bumper thread reminded me of a list question.  The repop bumpers are larger than the originals.  Anyone know of a source for the smaller, correct, original style door bumpers?
