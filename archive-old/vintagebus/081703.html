Do you  know where I could find a set of the red rubber socket  (ref VW :  111
255 409) that goes between the heater tube and the heater boxes on a  '62 ?


Hi Bertrand,
That particular seal was not used till AUG 1970 in the 1.2 liter engine  
starting with engine # D 0 675 000 in the type 1.  The pre-1968 bus heater  
connections were just a steel flex tube that went between the HEs and the  muffler - 
heater part 211 255 431 D, and after chassi # 215 036 650 the same  part 
number followed by the suffix &quot;B&quot;.
  Check out the 1958-67 bus parts manual _at_ 
_http://failsure_dot_net/oacdp/5867part.html_ (http://failsure_dot_net/oacdp/5867part.html)  and  make sure to check out 
the other manuals also there!!!
