After buying a new starter (because the previous owner said the old one was
burned out) I crawled underneath and noticed that the connector which feeds
power to the starter was not connected.  After I connected it, the Bus
started right up........BUT.........this is my first Bus, and I dont know
how it is suppose to sound when it starts. When I did start it it made this
funny sound right after it turned over (It made the sound you hear if you
try and start a car after it has already been started, just for a sec.
though) is this normal ?  Is there something I can do to make sure I dont
have
a problem ?

Thx,
