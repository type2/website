Back in 1981 I owned a '68 single cab in perfect
condition. Had to pay an outrageous $1200.00 for it!
Was laying brick for a patio at my first starter
house. Was young and cheap and stupid. -Didnt want to
pay to have the brick delivered. Drove from Tempe
Arizona to Chandler Arizona four times with half
pallets of Superlite pavers in the back end for each
load. Mooshed the suspension right to the ground
enough to make any lowrider cry with envy. I am no
longer young...
