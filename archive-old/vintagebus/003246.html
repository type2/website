&gt; I have never had anything hit me when driving with the safaris open.

[snip]

&gt; Don't see the point of having them wide open on
&gt; freeway.
&gt;

Well, see? You're missing at least half of the fun. Besides, as long as you
keep all of the other windows closed, it isn't too windy and there isn't
much stress on them when wide open. Partially open they flex all over
because they are deflecting a lot of air. That is how they get broke, near
as I can figure. Partially open is for low speed with the side windows open.
At freeway speed it's all or nothing, short of using the prop as you
suggest. That little bit of air isn't enough during an Arizona summer.  When
it's warm, you just stick your cigarette out the window for a second and you
can start puffing. When it's hot out, the metal on the dash gets a little
mushy. Safari's aren't so much just a neat accessory. They would work even
better if you had an NOS windshield squirter to give yourself a little mist
every now and then. 8^) Gotta get me one of those...
