My double cab had CB 044 heads when I got it and in less than 3000 miles (after I bought it) it dropped nearly all the valve seats in both heads.  It got hot and the heads didn't like it according to the mechanic.  He didn't seem all that surprised and mentioned that the CB 044s were know for dropping valve seats, although I did an extra good job of dropping them on my bus ;).  Don't know on the other stuff as I try to stay with stock as much as possible.  Ballancing is a good thing though.

Lastly, anyone have experience with the big valve heads, I'm referring to the 
CB 044 heads with 40mm valves, I like the idea of the extra meat in the heads
thanks all
