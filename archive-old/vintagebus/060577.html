Subject: Bad Turn Signal Switch?

Still trying to get the right rear turn signal to work. The truck was 
produced in 8/60, so it has the turn signal switch with six wires and then 
there is a rubbery wirec connector near the fuse box that has 3 wires coming 
in and 3 going out.

Here is what I found when I checked my turn signal switch w/test light. 

Left turn signal on: white and yellow stripe flash
Left turn signal and brakes on: red and purple steady light

Right turn signal on: green, red, and white flash
Right turn signal and brakes on: green, red, and white steady

Seems like something is amuk...anything else I can do or check or does this 
mean I need a new turn signal switch?

Sue
