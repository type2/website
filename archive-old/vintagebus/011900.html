As Mr.

Well, Perhaps you're comparing Golden Delicious to Granny Smith here!

The temperature of a VW's heat exchangers isn't really affected by the
thermostat, while the temperature of a W/C car's heater core is
greatly affected by the lack of a thermostat.

However:

The themostat on a VW has a lot to do with the _volume_ of air
available from the the heater.  When the flaps close the volume pumped
through the heater goes way up.  This is noticable when you go from a
steep uphill to a downhill in chilly weather.  The flaps are quite
open on the way up to disippate the engine's heat, but on the downhill
they close almost immediately and the air really blasts out of the
heater.
