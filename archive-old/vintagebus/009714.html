Subject: solder to repair pop-out window frames?
Date: Mon, 28 Feb 2000 16:31:18 -0700

title says it all=) I was wondering about the practicallity of using solder
as a filler to &quot;fix/fill&quot; some of the missing rims and edges from my popout
windows.
I pulled them last week and sandblasted them to reveal some pretty bad rust
damaged areas. I know that I can use filler or bondo/paint to fill in the
flat areas but some of the rims are damaged and I need to add material to
them.
If solder won't work, anyone got some suggestions on a possible alternative?
Thanks in advance,     Charles Dalgleish
