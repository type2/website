$99.95?  &gt;&gt;

Hi Wayne,
That is the best availible and is ten times better than any of the others.  
You should be able to find it new for $70-80.00 plus shipping.  
   If you want a camper you should call Jack in Farmington NM at (505) 
325-9797 and see if he has that SO-34 flip seat Westie still for sale for 
$3,500.00 including new 1776 engine!           Eric&amp;Barb
