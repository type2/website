&gt; so now i am stuck with a bus that MUST leave phonix for west texas by
&gt; monday, and to make things more exciting, the people i am renting the
&gt; moving truck from (budget) have no more trailers or dollies for this
&gt; weekend.

I'm pretty sure these are the guys that shipped our race truck from
Tulsa to Mesa: http://www.reliable-carriers_dot_com/  It looks like they
only do enclosed carriers, so it might be a bit expensive; I wasn't
paying for the shipment so I don't know how much it was.  Our truck got
there OK.  They have an office in Chandler; it might be easier dealing
with someone semi-local.

&gt; any suggestions?

Rent a dolly or trailer from some other rental company.  I think you
said you were getting a 24' van, and almost everyplace should let you
tow a Bus behind that.

If you end up having someone fly out and drive the Bus back, see if they
can get a refundable roundtrip air ticket instead of a one-way if at all
possible.  They can fly out, drive the Bus back, and then cash in the
other half of their ticket later.  If all they can get is a one-way, tell
them to plan for extra time for the rubber-glove treatment at every
airport they go through.

You could have one of the kids drive it, but you'll have to quickly
fabricate a booster seat and some pedal extensions.  :)
