&lt;&lt; Can any tell me how the middle seat (full w/ 1/3 fold down) ash tray on
 the back of the seat was attached?  Was it just rivited thru the seat
 material?  Did it have any type of backing?  I am fairly certain that
 the ash tray is the same type as on the spare tire cover.  Was the base
 the same? &gt;&gt;
if memory serves, there is a hardboard type panel underneath the upolstry 
that the ashtray attaches to. dont know about the base.
