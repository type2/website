Subject: berg shifter installed

We installed theBerg shifter Saturday , Sunday went to the San Antonio Texas area for a show.The shifter performed flawlessly.To to recap what we had done to my single cab in the last two months..We tore the trans apart to fix a jumping out of 1st and 4th problem,installed kits in each of the Kadron carbs,put new main jets in the carbs., did a super sync on the carbs  and installed a new steering wheel and we even installed some new hella driving lights. One other important thing we dis,we installed a new front shift rod bushing. The trip was about 375 round trip and had to be one of the smoothest trips i have taken lately.Trans cured, rich condition cured . Next up,Lafeyette lLouisiana,roughly700 miles round trip,for the Bayou Bug Bash,this Saturday  and Sunday.Wish me luck,it took me two days to get home last year from the show,this year no problem ,this ole truck has never run better.P.S. I had been running Mobil 1 gear oil &lt;gl 5 rated&gt; i took the suggestions of the list and changed to Sta-Bil gl 4  gear oil.I think I'll probably chang to Red Line MT 90 when i can find some, thanx for all the imput.
