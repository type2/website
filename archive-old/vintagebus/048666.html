Subject: Removing hubcap clip rivets
Mime-Version: 1.0

I found an easy way to remove the original hubcap clip rivets. What I did
was flip the wheel over to get at the backside of the rivet. I used a drill
bit that was slightly smaller than diameter of the rivet. I drilled into
the backside of the rivet just a little bit. Only enough to make the full
diameter of the drill bit. Make sense?

Then I grabbed a nice stout ?Punch? (tool, goes to a rounded off point at
the end). I set it into the small hole I drilled. Grabbed the hammer and
gave it about 3 or 4 good whacks. Popped it right out. I did this on all of
the wheels that needed it. It took about 4 or 5 minutes to do the 5 on a
wheel. Great!

I think the small amount of drilling did a few things. It gave me a nice
&quot;seat&quot; for my punch. It also heated the metal a little loosening things up.
Lastly, I think it gave room for the mushroomed backside of the rivet to
&quot;cave in&quot; while being forced out. 

While working on my 15 inch wheels I noticed something. I've got 2 1960
wheels, a '58, and a '57 one. The '57 one looks a little different than the
others. There is a kind of &quot;star&quot; design around the lugnut holes. Anyone
ever noticed the differences in the 15 inch wheels?
