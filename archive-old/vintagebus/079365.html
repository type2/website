Subject: Re: [VB] '61 Double Cab engine

how long have you had the engine in?   Maybe I'm lazy, but sometimes they 
seem to 'clean themselves out'.. with frequent oil changes, good gas and easy 
driving. Could be the rings need reseating if it sat a long time.  But you say 
it's been driven every day.  You can still do a compression check.. and check 
the end play.  Then again, was it oily smoke, or water vapour?   

But as long as it's where it is,   might be best (after checking end play and 
compression) to at least do rings and rod bearings if the bottom end feels 
tight, ps and cs look okay, and heads pass drip test.     but maybe it'll need 
more... good luck!!!

Yesterday I was able to borrow a trailer after work to bring my truck 
home. I drove it onto and off of the trailer. When I was backing into 
the carport I saw tons of white smoke. Darn. Looks like it's the 
engine for sure.

Today after work I got after it and yanked the engine. I tore it down 
the the &quot;longblock&quot;. All the tin, exhaust, carb, intake, ect. is off. 
Got it down to the heads.

I'm going to wait 'til tomorrow to tear into it. I'm hoping it'll be 
a bad piston or something. This is a beater motor. Actually was 
picked up off the ground in a field. They slapped a rebuilt carb and 
a muffler on it and fired it up. Darn thing ran smooth. Has pretty 
much continued to run smooth since I've owned the truck. And I drive 
it to work most every day.
