Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Dead

&gt; My bus took a minor hit to the front end yesterday. Enough to dent the license
&gt; plate as someone was backing up and didn't see me.
&gt; The engine stalled when I was hit and now everything is dead. I turn the key
&gt; and nothing happens, no click, or anything else.
&gt; Anybody know what to look for?
&gt; I have no lights, or ignition or any electrical function.
&gt; thanks in advance

the electrical harness may be pinched. it comes up through the frame right
at the nose.
