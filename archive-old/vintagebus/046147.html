Proof positive; quick poll, how many aircooled 
 owners have
 had a &quot;positive&quot; experience at their local VW dealers...with service/parts?


I have, when ever i come in with an old part, they let me brouse through there computer to get the part number and see if its still avalable, and they havent failed to get me a part the next day yet.
