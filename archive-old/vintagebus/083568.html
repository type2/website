&gt;&gt;  if you look at the owners manual for your VW, yes max speed=cruising   
speed.  
This is max speed they recommend the VW be driven at, NOT the  max  speed you 
can push it to go.  Does not mean they designed it to  be floored  w/o ill 
effect.
In fact, governors were added at  some point to keep the rpms from  going 
above what VW considered  max.  

VWs do run hotter when driven faster than 'max  speed'   &lt;&lt;


Hi Clara,
Ditto!!  Plus there is no golden certificate that running at max speed  you 
will get &quot;X&quot; miles on an engine new or rebuilt.  Plus all bus sales  manuals 
state MPG rating is at 3/4 of top speed.  Additionally the owners  manuals 
suggest one can drive the bus and bug in the 20s MPH in fourth  gear!!!!  Just try 
that and enjoy the lugging of the engine.
  Even in the 1963-67 Workshop Manual VW Transporter section M-6, page  6, 
talks about how to drill the early stock 40 HP heads, and larger lower pulley  
for better cooling.  The later 1300, 1500, 1600 engine have the same amount  of 
head cooling fins as the 40 HP (1200cc) engine! 
  Action often speaks far better than written words.  If VW  thought even 
3,500 RPM was fine for the VW engine they could have in the  Beetle gotten rid of 
4th gear by going with a three forward geared  tranny, OR changed the gearing 
from 0-15, 15-30, 30-45, 45-60 MPH _at_1,500-3,000  RPM, and gone to 0-20, 
20-40, 40-60, 60-80 MPH _at_ 1,500-3,500 RPM.  Must be  remembered that the Beetle was 
the sacred cow of VW.  Being that it was  their main seller and thusly any 
huge changes were done on other models of VW  first to field test these changes. 
 E. G. the 1959 1/2- 1960 bus  Bastard 40 HP engine.
  ONLY the K. Ghia was geared to hit 3,500 RPM at any shift  point and ONLY 
in third gear.  0-15, 15-30, 30-50, and 50-65  MPH.  We have pushed our 1963 K. 
Ghia to 85 MPH with stock 40 HP engine on  the flats!!  
   Still would be interesting to know if he has calibrated  his oil temp 
gauge and any more info on his engine that might  explain how it is staying that 
cool.  We have tried many ways, on many  motors to get a VW to cool better.  
3,000 RPM really seems to be  a safe limit for this, and in extremely hot 
weather have had to back off even  from this RPM a bit.  Plus the bus is just harder 
on the VW  engine.....
