Subject: Ultimate Engine

Hey List- I recently posted a request for advice on the compression ratio that I should run on an engine I am making plans to build. This got me to wondering what the list's idea is for the Ultimate Bus engine? Give me your idea.

 The application would be for a bus that is still running reduction boxes (hey what else is there?), has the common 3.88 or maybe 4.12 R&amp;P, with the common 0.82 4th gear, and tire size will be as close to the Bently height specification of 27.0 inch plus or minus 0.12 inch for the 15 inch rim and 26.0 inch plus or minus 0.12 inch for the 14 inch rim.

Now, what is the Ultimate Bus engine and I am talking about reliability/longevity  and power as the main goal. What displacement engine? carburetion? Cooling? Compression? Heads? Exhaust?

I hope to come up with a good combination that should serve as a starting point for any bus application and itemize the things that do not work good and the things that have been proven to work good.
