&gt;     Well I have good news for  those of you that attend and for those that
&gt; have been thinking about. BBB has moved. We are now RIGHT NEXT TO THE LAKE,
&gt; there is a huge grass area, cabanas with BBQ's and a huge sandy (packed) to
&gt; camp on. I will have pics up soon for you all to see the new site. We are
&gt; now walking distance to many local food places, The London Bridge and other
&gt; city stuff. After all the complaints we have had about crazy horse we have
&gt; found a much better location to hold it. NOW the good news. The cost have
&gt; gone down, prices will be posted along with pics soon.

This is _great_ news!  BBB has always been a top-notch event with the only
downside being the rather bizarre administrative procedures at the
appropriately-named Crazy Horse Campground.

Thanks to the London Bridge Bullis for listening to their public and
finding a great new spot!
