The only problem I see with that 23 window is the paint was faded and worn
off in spots.
When the new owner brings that bus back to the very humid midwest,it will
start to rust immediately.
It must be kept in a heated and a/c garage.
It's a bus you really can't use in the midwest . So it's a $20,000 trophy.

Also wasn't the pass. side corner dented.
