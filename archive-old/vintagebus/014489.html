Subject: How do you install the factory  locking  steering wheel  set-up
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

How do you install it on a US spec bus that never had it ?

do you have to weld tabs on the shaft like a bug ?

Anyone have factory instructions?

buses seem to &quot;disappear&quot; too much around here.........Or maybe just a BIG 
dog.....
