Subject: Re: [VB] What determines year of bus?

from 55 (? aug 55) yes the model year production started in the fall, not Jan 1, so you could have a 56 model year bus made in 55, or a 67 model year bus made in 66.    for the 65 model year the vin changed to a 9 digit system that the first 3 digits mean 
1st digit- type
2nd digit - model-
3rd digit - last digit of year of production, 

so a VW with VIN 217 xxx xxx would be a 67 panel, or withe 226 a 66 standard or with 265 a '65 truck.  A bug's VIN would start with 1, and type 3's would start with ...3

but before that, you can look at the M code plate for date of manufacture to see when it was made, or (especially if your bus is pre m-code plate) look up to VIN on a production list, such as in the back of the John Muir idiot book.

Then again, year of manufacture is largely a concept.   although some changes were made for YOM, such as 64s getting the first big rear hatch, many many many changes were NOT at YOM changes.   Some people subscribe to the 'leftover parts' theory to explain this.   ALthough that may be true in some cases (like the early 67s having single circuit master cylinders, a change that happened early in the 67 production year), it would seem a bit  odd for that to make sense when the change happens in, say April or June, not that long before the next model years starts.   I think largely VW just changed things as they went along.  Which is why for finding some parts for your bus it does help to have the VIN handy, if your bus was made near a change, unless you already know which version it takes.

The year on the title is for your DMVs info,  occasionally vehicles get titled wrong.

&gt; What determines the year model of your bus? Production date? chassis date?
&gt; ect.??? Or is it just the way it's titled? I know a car bought in '87 could
&gt; very well be an '88 year model car...know what I mean? Enough question
&gt; marks in this email? What do ya think?
