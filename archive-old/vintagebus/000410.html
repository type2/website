I missed the original post, evidently someone is freezing their tush off in 
the bus.  Not sure where or what year bus or what model.

Is heat getting INTO the bus?   Are the fresh air tubes (if applicable) in 
order?   Are the connection from them to bits to heater box good?  how about 
from heater boxes to body?  rust holes in tube up to the front?   tin can and 
hose clamps could be a temporary fix.  Some people insulate the heater boxes 
with I forget what kind of stuff.  Heater boxes open all the way?  check 
adjustment on cable or on wires holding them open.    Any extra holes in the 
fan housing bowing air elsewhere?- plug them.    A good engine compartment 
seal makes a big difference.   Also having a working thermostat helps warm 
the engine up, thus creating better lubrication for motor and heat for 
driver.  

Then, does the heat stay in the bus?   Big rust holes?   leaky seals around 
doors?  I replaced the seals around the cab doors in my 65 westy and it cut 
down on drafts.  Have a rubber cab floor mat and the under belly pan - they 
help.  I insulated the bus with that shiny bubble wrap stuff under the 
panelling- as it doesn't act like a sponge, works good.  Putting cab panels 
in also helped- the passenger vehicles came withthem but they were missing 
when I got the bus, VW put insulation in above the headliner in passenger 
vehicles.  

Every little bit helps.   Yes It takes about 5 minutes till the bus is warm, 
a bit more till it really kicks in, and at temperatures below freezing longer 
than that and it doesn't get all that warm when it is that cold out.  But I 
do like the heat in my bus.
