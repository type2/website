i think the buggest problem with &quot;throwing a tarp&quot; over the top of a car/van is that it is not breathable and as such tends to trap moisture (obviously not a good thing).

Those fancy schmancy breathable car cover$ look to me like they were made out of glorified &quot;J-Cloth's&quot; &lt;tm&gt;. I wonder if you can buy that stuff by the yard and save yourself the couple hundred bucks that people like RMMW would charge. Just a thought..

If you do have to go the tarp route I would suggest two things...

1. make the tarp _taught_ so that the water/snow run off the tarp instead of pooling on the bus..

2. wedge some old stryrofoam (or waterever inert object you have) underneath to keep the tarp from sitting directly on the bus as much as possible) and if you stuff enough pieces under the tarp strategically it will make the tarp taught faililitating water runoff..
