Hello all.  Well I finally broke down and did it.  I bought a Judson
Supercharger today, just had to have it.  I know they don't do a whole lot
but I have always wanted one.  Does anyone have any experience with these? 
Performance secrets?  Bus installation?  Any help is appreciated, 
otherwise I guess I'll figure it out.  My count only includes one 58 double
door at present I have been cleaning up as to start bying again.
