Yea...then with little 14&quot;s his freeway flyer will be
running about the same ratios as a stock tranny with
6.40 15&quot;s

&gt; &gt; I always said the freeway flyer stuff is ok if you
&gt; got
&gt; &gt; the big horses to do it...otherwise go stock.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Now don't forget that NQ IS ALSO RUNNING TALL
&gt; TIRES!!!!  It is a combination
&gt; of the tires with the freeway flier with his 1776
&gt; that is causing the
&gt; problem.  I bet that when he gets new 14&quot; rims and
&gt; tires He will be as happy
&gt; as a pig in a ......bus!
