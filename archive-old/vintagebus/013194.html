&gt; we have been alerted in Phoenix of a new and deadly virus...

Volks, the only way _any_ virus can infect your computer is if you run
an executable file (anything with .exe on the end) or if you open a
file that executes a macro (usually ending with .doc or .xl*).  If you
don't open these files no virus can get to you.

Although well-meaning, virus warnings propagated in mailing lists
aren't such a good idea.  They tend to waste more time and resources
then the virus itself.
