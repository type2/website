My bus is Titan Red and Beige Grey. It has been re-painted but I can use my door jambs as reference. My dash and fresh air housing are original paint and are more Beige color than the Beige Grey on my jambs. 

Also, when I pulled the overriders from my bumpers, I found what I think is the original bumper paint-a very light silver/grey.

Were the bumpers, popouts and dash painted different colors than the beige grey above the beltline?
