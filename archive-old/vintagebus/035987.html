&lt;&lt; Somebody want to check this one out for me?
 I found it on the Autotrader website, I know nothing about it,
 I'll assume it's a non-barndoor, and a non-'55 ('65?),
 but this is what the ad says:
 
 &gt;1955 VOLKSWAGEN Camper VAN
 &gt;4600 miles on rebuilt 1.8L ENGINE
 &gt;all camping access., runs great, good stereo
 &gt;must sell, moving overseas,
 &gt;$2200 or best offer, call CAMERON, 813-989-1188.
 &gt;Location: Tampa, FL

 To Chris and the beloved list,
   I called Cameron and he has told me that the bus has been sold, don't be to
upset though, as it wasn't a 55 or a 65, but a very rare 75!!!
