&lt;&lt;  I have to decide how to decide how much film to buy for Bad Camberg and
how much money to save for parts.  Anyone know how much stuff for sale I will
actually find there? &gt;&gt;
Hi Richard,
It kind of depends on what you have in the way of VWs since if we remember
correctly this meet is only open to pre-1956 VWs?  So later models of parts
are not as much represented there.  So if you have a Barndoor, a Kubel, or
Heb you are going to the right place.   Eric&amp;Barb
