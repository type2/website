&gt; &gt; so now we can reveal what part can be removed from a 1950 Barndoor
Deluxe
&gt; &gt; walk-through and installed on a 1998 Corvette...... Valve Stems...
otherwise
&gt; &gt; known as Schrader valves.

Um, when did VW switch to tubeless tires?  If it was after 1950, then
the 1998 corvette probably would have a hard time accepting the
Barndoor's tubes!

Now, if you're talking about the valve _core_, that might be the
universal part!

Personally, I was rooting for &quot;The nut that holds the steering wheel&quot;
as the only interchangable part :)
