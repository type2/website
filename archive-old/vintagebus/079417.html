Subject: scoping out a Bus for me.

I dunno how I screwed this one up,, but the Bus is actually closer to Hartford CT..
 can I try this again,,, I guess that wasn't even close!
even though it is further from me,, I can still do it...

Hi
I would like to have a bus checked out.

It is located near Hartford Ct.

Digital photos would be great but not necessary.

Is there anyone in the area with a few minutes to spare.
