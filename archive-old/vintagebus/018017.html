I've never seen a # on on.

Look at the quality of the stamping.  The repros are very thin, and the lines are 
not as &quot;crisp&quot;  The inside corners of the stamping will generally have imperfections
because the stamping dies used to make the repros are not as good as the originals, and
they're not stamped with the same amount of force.  Roundboxtools commissioned 
some repros that were pretty good, but not *perfect*.  I saw one that was sold by one
of the mail-order shops, blisted-packaged on carboard, that was just hideous.  The
chrome on the repros suck as well.

It's best if you have a known original emblem on hand to compare against.

&gt; If not, what's the best way to tell if the emblem is original.
