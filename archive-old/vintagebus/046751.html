&lt;&lt; Does anybody know their SKF number or where I could get some new? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
Well the problem is that the number would be the same for all bearing 
manufactures.  So there is no only SKF manufacture number unless they are the 
only ones who make the bearing.  To get the bearing numbers you really need 
to call your local bearing house for this info and thier price.  Do shop 
around a bit.  Which can make a big differance!   Eric&amp;Barb
