Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Electrical help on 1/10th of a bus

Thanks to all that offered help on this thread. I know have working parking lights! 

I went with 2 Candleabra bases, 6 ft of cord and two 4 watt &quot;nightlite&quot; bulbs wired directly into my outlets. 

Thanks again and I'll see you at happy hour!
