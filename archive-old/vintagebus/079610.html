Subject: Re: [T2] 205T distributor timing, vacuum question

&gt; &gt; Howdy. Finally picked up a nice 205T distributor to replace the 009 for my
&gt;  truck, which has a 1600 Single Port, running a 30/31 carb. Seems like

&gt;
&gt; I assume it is a 113 905 205T?   That means it is vacuum advance only. Vacuum (Advance Only): 17-19deg _at_ 1.3
&gt; In. Hg, 32-35deg _at_ 3.2 In. Hg   At full throttle, the timing advance goes away.
&gt; I think you would be better off with a vacuum and centrifugal advance dist. Like this one:
