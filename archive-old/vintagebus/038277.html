Hi Everyone,

	Ever had a really stuck bolt??  Or maybe rusted shift linkage that's
welded by rust??  How about a really stuck pin/sleeve assembly??  Well up
until a couple of days ago, I always resorted to WD40, Liquid Wrench, or a
torch.  I decided, on the advice of the FLAPS guy, to bite the bullet and
spend $8.00 on a can of &quot;KROIL&quot; to get the shaft on my old BN4's heat
regulator/switch un-stuck.  A couple moments later, all pieces were in my
hands and intact!!  At first I thought I got lucky.  Then I used it on the
equally stuck glow/spark plug.  Viola!!  Out with ease only after 30 seconds
dwell time.  Luck??  I think NOT!!  This is some good stuff!!  

	I'd never heard of the stuff before the parts guy recommended it to
me.  It's not an oil, it's more like a solvent that seeps in and breaks down
rust.  Whatever it is, IT WORKS!!  Just thought you all might like another
option for stuck stuff; not like you ever run into rusty hardware on old
VW's or anything
