Subject: are my cylinders junk?
Date: Tue, 3 Apr 2001 16:27:10 -0700

Sooo... finally decided to get down to business today.  Started cleaning the
old pistons and cylinders.  I put it off 'cause I hate cleaning stuff.
Initially I had decided they were fine.  After all, they're only a year old.
But on the first one I cleaned I notice there's one vertical groove that's
just deep enough that I can feel it with my fingernail.  Barely.

So... Junk or not?

Diana
