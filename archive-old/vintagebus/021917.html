Subject: [VB] How to check California title ??

Hi,

I need advise from a Californian or someone with experience importing to
Canada from Cal.

I am trying to buy a bus from in California and import it to BC. The bus is
here already but the owner is in California. I have made all enquiries about
import duties and safety checks but I am concerned about outstanding liens
and such. How do I check the title?
