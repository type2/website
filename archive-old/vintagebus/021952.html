&lt;&lt;  went the same route as Paul, I have my bus for fun and a New Beetle for
 &quot;necessary transportation&quot;.
 And for a couple of different reasons. First of all, I think of my bus as a 
unique
 vehicle with a finite lifespan.
 I save it for weekends and the days I do drive it to work are &quot;special&quot;. 
People
 see it parked outside and usually mention it.
 The NB is nice, but it's &quot;just another production car&quot; and therefore if it 
breaks
 or gets trashed I can replace it pretty effortlessly.
 I don't see the sense in pounding the miles to my work and back on my bus
 everyday. Plus I travel frequently into Chicago and other midwestern cities 
on
 business, and while I'm reimbursed for those trips, I'd rather not use my 
bus up
 for stuff like that.
 The other reason is the road conditions here in Illinois, which as far as I 
can
 tell are easliy the worst roads in the USA.
 Salt all winter to a ridiculous degree which eats the roads away in the
 summer...great for the contractors but hell on my bus, which gets either 
salted
 like a margarita glass in the winter or hammered to pieces by corroded 
expansion
 joints all summer.
  &gt;&gt;
now we are getting back to the daily driver VW vs the Sunday driver VW debate.

I do understand the salt issue, which however is not relevant here in the 
PNW, nor there in the SW.

anyway, I use my 65 westy as a daily driver, and have never owned anything 
but an ACVW, but that is my own personal biased way of doing things.  They 
are vehicles, right?  BTBD (Buildt to be driven).  And I like to drive an old 
VW, which is why I have an old VW (or more than one) (but I have cut down, 
really)

cold?  make your heat work and plug leaks/ wear a coat and gloves if 
necessary.

rainy?  how about some good window seals (roofing tar too!) to keep the rain 
out and working wipers

hot?  carry a spritz bottle and make sure all your cooling tin is in place.  
get safaris if you like.  

fix your brakes/steering/good shocks and tires and have fun.
