Well there's SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) which classifies bolts in
Grades 1-8, in order of tensile strength. There's ASTM (American Society for
Testing and Materials) which classifies bolts using ASTM designation #'s
(A307, A490, etc.) also increasing with tensile strength. Metric fasteners
which are classified by property class (4.6 - 12.9), also increasing in
tensile strength. This can get rather confusing, as different systems are
used for different applications. For materials in general (as opposed to
just bolts), SAE uses a &quot;Unified Numbering System for Metals and Alloys
(UNS), which uses a letter prefix to designate the materials (G for carbons
and alloy steels, A for aluminum alloys, C for copper-base alloys, and S for
the stainless or corrosion-resistant steels). The numbers following the
letter indicate the approximate composition, excluding carbon content, and
you'd need a chart and lots of patience to figure these out.

For stainless steels, the UNS prefix is S and the first number of the group
indicates the approximate composition. Thus 2 is a chromium-nickel-manganese
steel, 3 is a chromium-nickel steel, and 4 is a chromium alloy steel.
Sometimes stainless steels are refered to by their alloy content, i.e. % of
one component-% of another component. Thus S302 is often called an 18-8
stainless steel, meaning 18 percent chromium and 8 percent nickel. As you go
higher in chromium content, the corrosion resistance increases, however more
nickel must also be added if the hardness is to be retained.

The 8.8 you're refering to is a metric property class, corresponding to
medium carbon steel, quenched and tempered. This does not contain chromium
or nickel, and would therefore not be called &quot;stainless&quot;. This compares to
the SAE grade number 5. Both have tensile strengths around 120,000 psi. The
S302 stainless (or 18-8 stainless) has a tensile strength around 100,000
psi.

And all this leads to...as important as tensile strength and corrosion
resistance are in the design of a fastener, there are many other factors to
be considered in choosing a material (as well as # of threads, washers?,
thread pitch, diameter, etc). There's loading type (static, cyclic or
fatigue, torsion, shear, tension, compression, temperature, impact, intended
for removal or permanent?, etc.) which plays a part in determining which
material properties are needed (tensile strenth, shear strength, fatigue
life, thermal expansion, hardness, stiffness, corrosion resistance,
friction, weight, cost, etc.).

And this is why I say: stick to what they chose when they designed the car,
unless you know better.

Hope this helps and sorry so long :-)

&gt;
&gt; but my original question remains unanswered:
&gt; How does the strength of the stainless hardware compare to the
&gt; 8.8 which is
&gt; often found on VWs?  Is there a conversion from the SAE grades to the
&gt; European system (which is where the 8.8 comes from, I'm assuming)?
