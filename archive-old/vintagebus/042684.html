&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; The thing is that these are listed as coming soon.....  So that probably 
&gt; precludes being able to order them tomorrow.
I saw those,

Those are basically the halogen 1157's with a blue coating to make yer
taillights less visible.

If you scroll down to the bottom of teh page you will see the LED ones,
second to last picture.

Called &quot;High Output LED 1157 - Dual Filament&quot; listed as $10/each

take care,

Steve
