&gt; 6 ft cheater pipe helps here! Unless of course you break the head of 
&gt; 
&gt; the bolt off leaving the rest in the drum. Chris La Fon can tell you 
&gt; 
&gt; about some dipsh*t from west Texas doing that to his '60 
&gt; Standard....right Chris!?!?!?

I thought it was you who did that Rex ; - )  Yeah the poor '60 sat
helplessly for years while being picked apart by redneck buzzards toting
guns, beers, and 6' cheater bars. Till SuperRex the legendary Texas bus
magnet, saw the diamond in the rough. He rescued it from the scavengers
and an untimely death. Every hidden bus in Texas will eventually be found
by Rex.
