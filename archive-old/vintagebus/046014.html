Hi Hart,
If you lways use a oil filter of a good brand with it's own internal relief 
valve that should work alright.  Unless you do something stupid like drag 
race it during the first five minutes after starting cold in 40F or less 
temps with 30 wieght or higher oil.  As for the secondary cooler you either 
need to get a valving system to only allow the oil to this cooler when needed 
(Above 180F oil temp) or just remove it.  The dog house or type 4 coolers in 
the fan shroud are alot less likely to leave you in a lurch.    Eric&amp;Barb
