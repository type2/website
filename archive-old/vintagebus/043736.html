&gt;Vintage performance is my friend.  I already have a coffee can tip for
&gt;it so I can be kewl.  My wife said use Maxwell House but everyone knows
&gt;Folgers is da bomb.

WHAT?!?!  You're not using a NOS OG coffee can?  For shame!  You *know*
that American coffee cans will lose you two points at the Concours.
Five points off for a cheap knockoff Taiwanese coffee can.  If you're
into the custom scene a billet coffee can is also accetable.  Muir
tells you how to make a passable &quot;coffee can&quot; tip out of a couple of
soup cans and some nuts and bolts, if you're stuck with an emergency
on the road.  GB always said to drill a 3 mm hole in the bottom of
the coffee can for a condensate drain; lots of people argued with him
but he stuck by it.  Bob Hoover has stressed the importance of checking
the joints on the coffee can and re-crimping or re-soldering them as
part of a regular maintenance procedure.  It almost goes without saying,
but don't even try to order a coffee can at your local VW dealer; they
can't look up the part number and they tend to look at you funny.
