LONG 1st Jerome trip
	33808 by: Craig

Sorry you did not like Jerome..  We were waiting for your return call in
Phoenix.?
Almost everyone loved the band --  as I am sure no matter what band was up
there someone would not like them -- They were forced to do an encore --  so
I think that was a good sign.
Jerome, in the 14 years I have been going has always been a friendly place
for me--Next year we are trying for a later date in September -- But due to
other events we cannot go into October--With some 300 VWs and a couple of
thousand people things at times can get congested. Hope to see you there
next year--, uj
