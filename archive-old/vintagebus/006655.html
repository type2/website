There has been a person at the classic for the last 3 years with cases of
NOS Bosch or were they Hella, euro headlight assemblies, he has been selling
them for 175.00 a pair every year, he has what he calls barndoor and later
headlight assemblies and they do have the drain holes in the bezels, the
difference was the placement of the adjusting screws.


ronnie

ps. but with this ebay thingy happening he'll probally want 175.00 each this
year.

Yup.  The one I looked at here in sacramento actually had VW logos on it's
headlights.

A set of &quot;barndoor&quot; headlights I bought on ebay actually came in Mercedes
boxes.
They were only slightly different than VW ones, but I still think it's 
dishonest to market them that way.
