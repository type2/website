&gt; I bought a '66 bus that was already lowered, using lowering spindles in the

&gt; the wheel well.

Hi Tom,
Sooo many factors and sooo little data.  You might:
1.  Get rid of the tall narrow motorcycle tires and rims you fitted into 
there.  ;-) (What sized tires, especially OD????)
2.  Stop driving up and down the steps at city hall.  ;-)
3.  Have a front suspension that additionally has adjustable sections welded 
into the front beam and just need to adjust the front beam back up.
4.  Have a front suspension that additionally has had spring leaves removed 
to weaken the springs to lower it, or failure of these leaf springs 
(cracking) due to wear, DPO driving habits, or even removal of front 
suspension rubber snubbers and their mounts.  DANGER, DANGER,  (Flailing arms 
about) this can easily result in the rest of the leaves failing suddenly 
while at speed.  Resulting in the front of the bus suddenly resting on its 
front wheels and even the pavement.  Look Ma no steering!!!  Flip, flip, 
flop!
