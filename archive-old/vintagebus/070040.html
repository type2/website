Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Oil &amp; Cooling

&gt;Small engine has nothing to do with VW Air Cooled.
&gt;Take a quick look at VW oil pans, built for cooling oil.


yup.

&gt;Cylinder fins, for cooling.
&gt;Fan on engine for cooling.

NOT necessarily for oil... for the heads and cylinder mainly, with 
some for oil cooler.



&gt;
&gt;Oil plays a major role in cooling the VW Air Cooled.

i'd go no higher than 50% :)


&gt;High oil temperatures break down the engine oil, thin out the engine oil,
&gt;oil pressures drop.


but WHY are your temps high? because the engine is putting in more 
than it can get out. i can swim in the arctic ocean and feel better, 
but still have a fever!

&gt;If you can get your engine oil running about 200 / 220 degrees your
&gt;engine will last a long time.



i agree - but first i'd like to see if putting the porsche pulley on 
really helps before making plumbing mods!


ps - where and how deep does one notch the rods for the slinger 
effect? couldn't find it in my books.
