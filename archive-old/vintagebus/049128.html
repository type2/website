Here's another ridiculous question.  I'll try and make it crystal clear, read the following very slowly:

Inside the gas door opening, to the left side, is the plate with a slot in it that the catch on the gas door slips into to keep the gas door closed and locked.  The question has to do with the PLATE that is mounted to the bus, not the catch on the door.  Is the portion of the plate on the drivers side of the slot (the slot is approx. 1/8&quot; wide, the portion of the plate in question is approx 3/16&quot; wide and to the right of the slot), straight, or does it have a curved bend in it, curving back toward the back of the bus.

It's hard to describe, and hard to visulaize, but easy to see and describe when looking at it.  Can someone out there peek at their bus and see if it's flat or bent?

TIA.

Robert
