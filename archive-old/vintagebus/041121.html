Root around in your junk box for a hex nut that fits in the plug.  Then use
a three-sided file to square out the hole in the nut so that it will fit on
a 3/8&quot; drive.

&gt; &gt;I seem to have lost my transmission filler socket, and
&gt; &gt;need to buy another one.  I don't want one of the
&gt; &gt;big 17mm allen wrenches - I'm looking for the 3/8&quot; dealy.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Any suggestions?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I got two of them on Ebay last year for around $5 each.  It was a dutch
&gt; auction.  I think the guy had a ton of them.  Want me to find his address?
