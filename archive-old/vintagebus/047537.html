&lt;&lt; So when I installed it, I installed it in the upper most position, and 
when you pull the knob it comes all the way down - is that the way to do it?&gt;&gt;
Hi John,
If you mean by down that the cable end of the lever on the reserve valve 
should be in it most downward and forward, then yes!  

&lt;&lt;It seems as though gas won't flow unless the knob is all the way out.  I'm 
very sure that the level of gas is above the tube inside.  hmmmmm  &gt;&gt;
You say &quot;tube&quot;, but do not specify which.  The open (To the upper main 
portion of the gas tank) or reserve?
Beware some of the present day OEM reserve valves are plumbed backwards and 
require carefully removing the brass open and reserve tubes and switching 
them to get them to work correctly in the vintage bus.  Eric&amp;Barb
