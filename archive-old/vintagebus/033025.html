&lt;&lt;  I think the 4.375 splined is a Gleason now that I think about it.  
 It is an 8-bolt ring gear. &gt;&gt;

Look for a &quot;G835&quot; stamped on the pinion shaft
 
 &lt;&lt;The '63-67 Bus Bentley says that the 1200's came with 4.125 and the 
 1500's came with 4.375.  When they changed from the 1.29 to the 1.26 
 reduction gears, they changed the ring &amp; pinions which resulted in 
 the final cruising rpms being about the same.&gt;&gt;

The Bentley says this, the Bentley says that.  From what I have seen
in the real world is that they tended to come in the 4.125 ratio.  I have
only seen one 4.375 8-bolt set in the last year.  Also, the early tunnel
redux ratio was 1.39 ( the split cases came with 1.40s).  Post-'64 46mm
nutted boxes were 1.26s.
 
&lt;&lt; Yes, I want to use the .82 4th.  Berg sells new 3.785 keyed for about 
 $160...... &gt;&gt;
 
 Then run the late Beetle splined style and use a early 002 splined 4th.
But then again, $160 for a new R/P set is *very* reasonable.  You pays
your money and takes youse choice.
