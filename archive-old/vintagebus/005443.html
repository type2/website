I have the same problem with my '67, and made the same discovery sitting in
the driveway at the house (about a 5% grade).  I chose the obvious (dont
fill it all the way up) solution unless I know I am on the road and will be
driving it 40-50 miles before I park it.

In the end, I believe that the issue is with the expansion (in volume) of
the gasoline; out of a cool underground tank and into a bus tank which is in
fairly close proximity to the engine; and not with the cap or tank.

&gt; OK - So I am frustrated that everytime I fill up, and I don't mean
&gt; top-off, my tank leaks out the filler cap when I park. The streets in
&gt; Minneapolis are graded pretty steep and it can be kind of embarrassing
&gt; not to mention dangerous with a puddle of gas by the rear tire.
&gt;
&gt; The obvious is to stop before the pump does, but I'm wondering if a
&gt; different cap might help, or perhaps a different tank, I need to remove
&gt; mine eventually to replace the level sender for the guage.
&gt;
&gt;  Any ideas?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks - Tim in Minneapolis
