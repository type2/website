Subject: Re: [VB] Engine mount

Yes, I removed the bushing 20 years ago, and I glue the bolt in. It stays
there until I need to remove the tranny, and allows me to simply thread a
nut on from the rear, and tighten/loosen it with the handy flat ratcheted
17mm wrench from Sears or Proto. See my page on how to glue the bolts
(yes, both) in properly. Makes the engine removal/install a quick and
clean operation.

&gt; I have a late model 1600 DP and the top left hand bolt hole on the engine has
&gt; a threaded type bushing so the mount bolt threads in from the front. This is
&gt; not handy for removal and replacement of the engine on the 61 Bus because the
&gt; clutch lever makes it difficult to get a wrench on the bolt. It would be
&gt; better if there was just a nut on the backside used with a halfmoon type bolt
&gt; like the starter on the other side. Has anyone dealt with this problem?
