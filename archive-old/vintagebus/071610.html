Subject: Type 4 conversion?

Has anybody done a type 4 conversion in their splitty?  How'd it go?  Run
into any problems?  What exhaust did you use?  What changes were made to the
motor?  E-mail me privately and tell me everything.  I'm considering this
with my '67, as I have a 914 that I can pull the motor out of.  Thanks.
