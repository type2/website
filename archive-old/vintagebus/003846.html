&gt;
&gt; does anyone know of a Canadian source for Por-15
&gt;

Try John Connolly at www.aircooled_dot_net From Salt Lake City, Utah, but he is
a distributor for POR-15 and other products in their line and he ships
worldwide. Good technical support, too. He's real quick, doesn't sell any
crap and knows what he sells.
