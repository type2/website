Subject: Re:  FW: [VB] 21 vs 23 - which is more rare

I like 15 windows better than 23s.    who needs that dumb hole in the roof 
and the skylights which put glare in your eyes.   Prefer the 15s with the 
pointy turn signals.   Ideally in turquoise/blue white.   Which, in N Am. 
spec is april 61 throgh end of 61 model year.   I found one of that age, but 
it is SWR/BG.   :(  anyone know of the buses I am lookingfor?    Used to be 3 
15s running around town.      None anymore -  electrical fires/dead 
motors/accidents/mechanical breakdown .   :(



I have a 63 15 window deluxe, which means 23 were made into 63, like Steve

say's. If we are talking about rarity, what about the 15 window? I have seen

way more 21's AND 23's than I ever have 15's. Anyone agree? We are talking

more rare right? Not more popular. *Example* I have twenty Han Solo figures

from the star wars movies, and one Salacious Crumb (Jabba the Hut's little

rodent sidekick). The Han is more popular, but the Salacious Crumb is far

more rare. See what I'm saying?
