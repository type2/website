I've been driving the Westy around, and enjoying it very much.  But the top 
end seemed to be gone.  It'd spin up ok, but it would kind of stop trying as
the RPMs approached 2700-3000.  I found out why today with the timing light:
mechanical advance is dead.  Vacuum advance is there and works great, but I'm
missing out on my 009-style action :-)  About a year ago I freed up the advance
on the dizzy with penetrating oil; my theory is that it spent some time in 
disuse and some rust formed in there.  I could probably do that again and get
it working, assuming it didn't finally break.  Anybody run into this and come
up with a more reliable fix?  I need to reshim it anyway, so if disassembly is
in order, I'm all for it.  If all else fails, I have three more of these
things.

Some notes on the rebuilt tranny.  Fourth gear howls.  Not as loudly as in
the Kombi, but it does.  Second gear has a little bite to it until the oil has
warmed up some, then it smooths out.  Finally, third gear has popped out about
five times in 300 or so miles of driving.  I'm looking for opinions on what to
adjust to get around some of these problems (I know 4th gear is just gonna
howl).  Heck, even some input on what you think about the life of a tranny
doing this stuff.  This is my first rebuilt, so I don't really know what I'm
supposed to expect out of it.  And, no, I've never actually driven one that
was perfect either.

Can you believe I have to work on Mother's Day?  I can't.

And, joy of joys, back to GSU again Monday.  Whee.  Summer vacation was about
five days this year!
