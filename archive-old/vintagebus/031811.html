Well, we made it through it. It was a very exciteing 3 day event. There were
41 listys in the group photo, almost twice s many as last year. The word
must be out!! No real problems to speak of and fun was won by all. JP
Hendriks (a fellow list member) made the front page of our local paper (no
he wasn't arrested) followed by an excellent write up of the event. 

JP won the rebuilt Rancho trans, so now he won't have to keep swapping his 1
good trans between his buses and the rebuilt turn key engine was won by Kyle
Tillman (westfailure) maybe he'll pull out that Ch#_at_y engine and put a VW
back in the limo.

I could go on for a while but NQ said he will do a complete write-up on his
experience when he gets home and put a link to it, going to be long.

I'm going to bed I'm tired, till the next time

ronnie,  London Bridge Bullis
allready planning BBB VI
