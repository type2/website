Subject: Re: [VB] cyl head temp

also, one way to cool heads is to clear out the casting flashing.   You do 
have to take the engine out and take the intake tin off to do this, but hey, 
I think it helps air flow thus cooling.   You could get us before and after 
numbers.

I also wondered what kind of cooling set up you have now (dog or no dog, etc)
I though 350 when you put your foot on the gas was normal.  at least teh few 
buses with HTS I've seen have said about 350 on the gas, goes doen to 250 
foot off the gas.

&lt;&lt; Do you have the vanes and thermostat installed? Hoover bit (if you have a 
 doghouse oil cooler) and all the correct pieces of tin? Vanes straighten the 
 flow, the hoover bit (frame sealing bracket) keeps air from sneaking past 
the 
 oil cooler. 
 
 If you don't have a doghouse shroud get one. It moves the oil cooler out of 
 #3's way. Maybe your bug has a doghouse and thus the difference. 
 
 Anything else out of the ordinary? 009 dizzy? Dual carbs? When you move away 
 from stock it changes things, to say the least.
