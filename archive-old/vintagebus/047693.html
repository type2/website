&lt;&lt; Does anyone know this time period???  Or is this polarizing procedure 
worth doing at all?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Adrian,
About 15 seconds will easily do it.  Definitely worth while.  Many moons ago 
went through two good used generators that had sat around for a long time 
after installing them without polarizing.  Never have had that problem since 
then due to always polarizing new or used replacement generators.  Eric&amp;Barb
