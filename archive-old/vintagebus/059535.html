Subject: Re: [VB] Purpose of these B-pillar holes?

To add my 2 cents to the convo I recall calling WW many years back =
regarding shoulder belts and they didn't carry them as the thought was =
that the pillar couldn't support the force in the event of a crash. Food =
for thought.

Just a guess, but how about installation hole for a three-point seatbelt?

Subject: [VB] Purpose of these B-pillar holes?


&gt; In my 67 DC, just underneath each coat hook on the B-pillar, there is a
&gt; round hole with an opaque plastic plug in it.  Big enough to stick a
&gt; finger in and feel around.  Removing the plug, there is nothing but the
&gt; bare inside of the B-pillar--no screw heads, nuts, nut plates, wiring,
&gt; etc..  Anyone know why VW would put these holes in a DC, then plug them
&gt; up this way?  Access to B-pillar for....??  Installation hole for....??
&gt;=20
&gt; Just wondering.
