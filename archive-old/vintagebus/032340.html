Hi Folks -

I drove my (then newly purchased) 61 PU as a daily driver for over a year, 
grumbling at this dizzy/carb combo.  Yes, the highly touted off idle 
'nothing there' stumble, the idle that wouldn't hold - quit entirely when 
cold, revved embarrassingly high when hot, the choke that wouldn't.  This 
is a stock 7.0 CR DP 1600 with 1.25 rockers and an extractor exhaust.

As part of installing a set of the new version Pertronix pointless', I 
finally took the carb off to give it a good look.  Hmm, what's this 65z air 
correction jet doing with this 120 main?  And why is the mixture screw out 
only one and one half turns while the idle speed screw is out seven 
turns?  Why would the o ring on the mixture screw crumble in my hands as I 
inspect it?  Well, you get the idea.

Taking some tips from earlier posts (was it Ronnie who said put in a 150 
main jet?) and not counting a few embarrassing moments when it would no 
longer start at all (coil wire pulled off); or after the first road test 
when it couldn't get above 40 with a case of the dry heaves (forgot to put 
the 'anti run on' plunger back in, leaving the idle circuit in quite the 
disarray with the gaping hole thinning things out) - I persevered as follows:

   1.  Took it apart, including the two (small and teeny) check balls, and 
used most of a can of carb spray through it.  Inspected the spritzer volume 
- this one was ok and pointed properly, just missing the venturi 
wall.  Made certain that all vacuum ports were sealed.
   2.  Pop riveted shut the hole in the throttle plate.  Set choke to 
factory position.
   3.  Used new O rings and float bowl needle/seat from rebuild kit; also 
new mixture needle valve.
   4.  Put in a 140 main jet and 125z air correction, used stock (looks 
like) 65z idle jet.
   5.  Disabled the anti run on plunger by nipping the business end off 
(fresh heads and no run on).
   6.  Ended up with two one half turns out on mixture screw and am still 
fiddling with idle speed screw, depending upon ambient air temp.

The result?  Morning startups are two pumps on the accelerator, leave up, 
turn the key and Chester quietly fires up with the choke working 
properly.  With the stripey points 009 set to 34 BTDC (remember my low 
compression) advance, he eases off the starting line smoothly at part 
throttle, or leaps ahead (gimme those redux boxes) when mashed.  There is 
_no_ hesitation.  Nor any when shifting into higher gears.  Cold, Hot, 
didn't matter - he idles at a smooth 750 - 900 all the time. What a delight 
to drive. Never did install the Pertronix yet.  The exhaust is still a deep 
black/brown, but short of sooty.  Getting a consistent 23 mpg.

Now that cool mornings have finally gotten to the 2500' Sonoran desert, and 
(sigh) without any flaps in the fan housing; but with cool tin installed - 
he really wants to be warmed up before setting out into the commuter races 
on our rural roads.  It takes about 10 miles at 50 before feathering the 
throttle uphill at 40 keeps him lit properly.  If still cold, the air/gas 
mix isn't quite right, with the familiar loss of power that increased 
throttle doesn't help.  This is likely made worse by the extractor being 
too 'efficient' at low temps - while the incoming mixture is too cold and 
dense to light up properly.  But once warmed up, low speed operation is 
aok.  You really get a sense of the importance of correct head temp as a 
factor in proper burning.  My next test will be to change the main/air jets 
about to see just what is the best lower temp combination.

I conclude:  the 009/PICT 34 combo works just fine for me - and can for 
you.  Although this combo is easier to set up for hot weather driving than 
for the far North folks, it does work.  Get yourself some jets, along with 
a rebuild kit, and give it a try.

More later,  Nick..
