Adam is rite in most counties its a raquet, guilford and forysth , are much
tougher than randolph where i am, plus you get ahold of the occasionly DA
that has no idea what he is doing and you have to jump thru hoops to get
inspected. I think Adam is against clunker laws ,, go look at the pics of
his 57 restoration!!!!!!!!  LMAO , sorry dude couldn't resist (evil grin)
