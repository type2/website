I have had the same problem with fuel line bought around the same time. I
was told it was a bad batch. I would be really careful with any of the
cloth braided stuff. I was convinced I was doing the right thing, it even
says made in Germany on it. It lasted about a year and a half and the ends
dried and cracked. I hate the look of the US rubber stuff, but if it keeps
my ride from burning I will use it.
