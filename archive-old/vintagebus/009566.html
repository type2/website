&gt;Did a little poking around on Old Volks Home websdite
&gt;and have determined that the distributor in my bus is
&gt;a 'can use' on a '68-70 1600 bug with auto-stick trans.
&gt;
&gt;It's a 0 231 115 078 numbered distributor.

Jeff,
Don't know if it's an appropriate distributor or not.  I have one of these
and was going to try it out someday, but never got around to it.  It is a
vacuum advance only, unlike most VW distributors which are combination
vacuum/mechanical.   I could try and look up the specs on it in my Bentley
for bugs of that year tonight or maybe somebody will have it handy before
then.  Seems like it might not have the right advance curve if it's all
vacuum though.

John
