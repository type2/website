Subject: Re: [VB] pics...now engine light

I have a VW 181 (Thing) dash light that is switched (on-off) with the sliding
cover. Picked it up years ago always intending to install it in the, now sold,
67 Westfalia.

I might break down and work on my splitty bus some day when the Phoenix temps
drop below boiling and the Mrs. and I are not negotiating over how the
collective spare five minutes of family time is spent. I am starting to
understand how these buses end up as neglected storage units.

This weekend is another attempt at R&amp;I of Dasher front axles and Strut
cartridges. Fun stuff for unexperienced driveway mechanics. The splitty is
looking better and better.
