The '63 DC is on the street waiting for me to drive it to get parts for the '66 Riviera. The Riviera is under the Costco shelter (with the spare side tarp strung over the sun weakened south half) undergoing a front brake job. The '65 21 window is at Dennis Sullivans waiting for new floors and left side transplant. The '74 electric Thing is waiting for the Riviera to move out of the shade so I can install new batteries and boxes. 

Latest salvage news from the last few weeks... Found a F*rd camper with 7 donor jalousie slats ($1 each) to go in the Riviera. Karl has a diamond band saw to cut off the extra lenghth. Somebody slammed Karl's bay westy's rear window to bits that reached the front windshield so we found a replacment. I found a push button AM-FM mono Blaupunkt from a BMW 2002 that fits in the Riviera well. $9 included the bpunkt speaker, great sound. Grabbed a couple allen lock nuts from a bay to go on the Riviera and a dual circuit brake resevoir from a Volvo to go on a dc master to be installed later. 

I'll be in Portland next weekend and will have part of Saturday free. Anything happening besides the OBF?
