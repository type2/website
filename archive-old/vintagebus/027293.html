Well....since you bring it up.. :)
I live a few blocks away from a friend of mine that has owned his 62 bus
since 66 and is the most heavily modified bus I have ever seen.  period.
Wood burning stove with a propane setup for starting the stove, holes in the
floor for ice fishing, cut out bulkhead with swiveling lawn chairs, fuzz and
fur everywhere (great for velcro!), pull start 1600 motor...yes! pull
start...its off of a snowmobile, stainless heater boxes and exhaust
system..the list goes on.  He also has stainles rockers and doglegs etc.  He
fabricated them himself and welded them in using a wirefeed welder with
stainless wire.  It looks great and he said it works nice too.  I'd like to
do it...but I dunno about the fabrication part of the bit.  He has rolled the
bus once and I think he got hit another time.  he replaced a lot of the bus's
body metal but has yet to do the drivers side which currently has about 12
gallons of bondo on it.  many affectionately call it the &quot;Bondo Condo&quot;.  The
thing is a beast.  Woody and a few others in the DBG will vouch for this!  i
went ice fishing with the fellow a month or so back...him in his bus and me
in Stella.  He threw on his tire chains and out we went.  We sat in that bus
for hours and the woodburning stove is VERY nice to have.  man that is a nice
setup.... anyways...back to the stainless part.
yes, it will work.  is it difficult? yes, from what I hear stainless is
difficult to work with.  but hey....isn't it worth it?  why not struggle once
and be done with it?

fwiw....



&gt; I recall someone on the list was either instatlling stainless rockers or
&gt; already had.
