&lt;&lt; One trick that I picked up many years ago is to wrap a shop towel or rag
around
  my wrist before reaching to disconnect the fuel line from underneath the
car. &gt;&gt;
Hi,
If you install the flexable fuel line so that there is about 6&quot; extra.  Then
when you drop the engine down you can remove the fuel line from the engine
compartment by reaching over the forward left of the engine.  Also you can
install a reserve switch on any 1962 and later bus so you can shut off the
fuel flow and then have no problems with changing those fuel lines under the
your bus.    Eric &amp; Barb
