An update on this:  Thanks to Ronnie (and especially
Hart Ponder [Great name!] Barry made it back to New
Mexico in time to get to work, and we'll get his bus
back soon.

The facts, and nothing but the facts, from your
intrepid reporter, JP!

&gt; NEWS FLASH; just came in. JP just called and he is
on his way to Havasu. We had a small BUS problem.  
Berry in his logoed DD broke down in Yucca, Cal. on
his way home, I had decided to come home last night
and got a call from JP on my cell that Berry had
broken down in Yucca, a quick change in my route home
and I was in Yucca looking for Berry. As luck would
have it I found him driving down the street. A few
phone calls later we had Hart Ponder come down (he
lives in Yucca), Berry followed him up to his house,
he spent the night there and JP picked him up on his
way back to NM. This is what bussing is all about,
looking out for and helping each other.
