&lt;&lt; When I got home I dried it off and sprayed it with a light oil.  That
should be good at keeping it rust free....no?? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Light oil?  10, 30, or what wieght.  WD-40 is also a light oil and it will
evaporate in about a week due to it being so light and most all other oils
actually attract moisture.  Better material is wheel bearing grease, which is
only topped by cosmoline or roofing tar for sealing and protection.  It is
always best to heat the part to about 200F to drive any moisture out of the
pores of the steel/cast iron part before coating.  We use a kitchen oven set
on warm and that does the trick.   Eric &amp; Barb
