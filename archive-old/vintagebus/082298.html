Subject: master cylinder

I noticed my master cylinder is leaking(towards the front of it). This is
one of the &quot;german made&quot; ones that I installed when I first got the bus,
back in August '98. I think it was arount $100 back then. First thing I did
to my bus(so my log book says).

Anyway I need to replace this. Is seven years considered a decent amount of
time for these things to last? There seems to be two types of these MC on
the market one costs less than $20 and one costs close to $100. Is the
quality that different, I know it is my brakes so I want to get what makes
sense, but my last replacement only lasted 7 years(I imagine I was replacing
the original one which was way older than that).

Thanks for any suggestions...
