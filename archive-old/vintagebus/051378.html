Ronnie,
That would be great.  In the few hours since I posted the message, I've
already
received over a dozen responses with interest at one level or another.

It looks like between soaking up some sun this summer and not teaching, I've
got
a project lined up.

Thanks,
Scott

&gt; I'm in the process of lining up some projects to work on during the summer
&gt; while I'm off on break.

&gt; Is there any interest in sets of repo hoops being made that are damn near
&gt; duplicates of original ones?
