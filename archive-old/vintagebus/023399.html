Hi Volks,
This is not a bad idea, but one must keep in mind that doors were 
manufactured after the end of production of that particular bus as replacment 
parts.  So at best this should be used with a grain of salt as to how late 
the part is and the knowledge that at best the date can only show how early a 
type of door or rim was made.   Eric&amp;Barb
