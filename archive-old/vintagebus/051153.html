Subject: RE: [VB] Listee stickers?

I'm game on this idea. I am a non-west (ahem) listee, and perhaps
'ordering' them from type2_dot_com plus some postage might be an option, if
someone wants to manage the distribution? Too bad there are only 6 or 7
non-west listees, right? :)

Rich,
You are correct sir.....cut vinyl stickers.......likely a
'vintagebus2type2_dot_com' and a simple bus graphic.

There seems to be some interest,  If it keeps up this way...I will post
more
details...work something out for our non-west listees., and post some
artwork
or a sample pic.

&gt; Agree with Ray on this one. I am thinking that it would look something

&gt; like this, with the appropriate text of course:

&gt;
&gt;  I do these for another site (guess which) and they are about
&gt; $1.50/pair  in quantity. Beto, is this what you're thinking about?
