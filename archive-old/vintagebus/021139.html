&gt; As you know, I run Optima batteries in my 911 and
&gt; in my VW bus, and have been for a while.  The battery
&gt; in the 911 didn't want to crank the engine over after
&gt; sitting for a month and a half, and didn't want to
&gt; take a charge.  Interstate requires you to send the
&gt; battery back to them for evaluation, and if they
&gt; deem you battery to in fact be bad, then they'll
&gt; make good on the warranty, otherwise I guess they just
&gt; send your battery back to you.  Unfortunatley it's more
&gt; than a week's turnaround, which I find unacceptable.

This is a common method of making sure that few items are returned for
warranty replacement.  Don't be surprised if your battery somehow gets
&quot;lost&quot; or there is a &quot;paperwork SNAFU&quot; in the process as well.  Make sure
that there is a paper trail (such as tracking numbers) in the shipping
process so you can be sure that they received the goods.

Optima batteries are nifty, but I much prefer a conventional battery in a
good plastic battery box as long as I'm not subjecting the battery to
excessive shaking or G-load. No corrosion problems and Pep Boys sells 'em
for $40 with a 6-year warranty.  No hassle with returns either.  If one
doesn't work, the new one is pro-rated for the remaining warranty of the
old battery on the spot.  They'll even pro-rate it by reading the date
code on the battery if I don't have the receipt.
