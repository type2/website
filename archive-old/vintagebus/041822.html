&gt; In  case anyone's still interested, here's a story on the Firestone tires
&gt; that are being recalled:

Reading between the lines, this seems to be due to:

1. Possible problems at the Decatur plant (only those tires are recalled.)

2. Ford's recommendation for owners to run these tires at a low 26PSI
(Firestone recommends 30PSI).
Apparently Ford specified the low pressure to improve ride quality, as
most SUV owners don't want them to ride like a truck.

3. High temperatures (the first recalls are in the US southwest.

Anyway, it looks as if the VW bus tire supply is safe.  We don't use the
P235/75R15 size being recalled, and we use much higher load ratings than
the P-metric tire.
