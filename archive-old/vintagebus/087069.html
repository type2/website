Subject: Re: [VB] Powdercoating a Roof Rack

Really? Engine tin has far more right angles and sharp corners than an industrial rack would or does as it's made from round tubing. I have a stock pulley that was powder coated as well.

Hi Sean,
We have had our RGB axle tubes done in powder coating also, with great 
results. Both this and engine tin do not have the extreme tight angles that we 
are talking about. Though where the intake manifold and the heat riser tubes 
meet are in that category.
