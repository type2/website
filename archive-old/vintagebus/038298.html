Subject: Rear brake shoe trickiness?
Date: Mon, 17 Jul 2000 08:50:43 +0200
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi list,

Can anyone tell me why both of the rear brake shoes that have the e brake
lever attached to them would have worn out completely and both opposing
shoes have not. The worn ones have about 1mm of material left while the less
worn ones still have at least 7mm.

Also, the worn(e braked) shoes have worn at a slight angle ie. more on one
edge than the other.

At first I thought that it was clogged flex lines but I figure that that
would affect all the rear shoes. Is that assumption correct?

Then I thought that it might be the e brake adjustment being too tight but
the e brake only grabs when it is three or four notches from the end.

Any suggestions would be welcome.

TIA

Michael
