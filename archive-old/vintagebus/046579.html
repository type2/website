Pmailed us:
&lt;&lt; 211 953 215 C  Relay-Emergency flashers can be found at Rocky Mountain 
Motorworks and at Wolfsburg West for $12, The VW dealer has them too but they 
are 62 bucks. &gt;&gt;
Hi Ty,
Great!  That is a relief.  Do you know if they have the E-flasher relay in 6 
volts?  
Thanks for the info,  Eric&amp;Barb
