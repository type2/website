How can I remove the steering wheel, without damaging it further.  It is
in good shape, just not lined up with the wheels.  My turn signal switch
is pointed to the 11 o'clock position, so it will cancel.

the steering wheel on a 67 splitty is keyed, not splined, it only goes on one
way.

To adjust the steering wheel so it lines up straight there is an adjustment on
the draglink.

One end must be removed- i think at the pitman arm, and spun or unspun enough
to make the wheels line up straight when the bar is straight across on the
steering wheel.

Perhaps your steering may  need other attention
