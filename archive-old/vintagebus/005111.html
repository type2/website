Subject: re: Kadron cable linkage

Last week someone reported that they had made a linkage for dual Kadrons
that were cable operated. I've been thinking about this and it seems like a
great solution to the expansion - contraction problems with a push pull
linkage. Now that that message is long gone, I'm thinking of doing something
like this. Would the person who posted that message please p-mail me?
