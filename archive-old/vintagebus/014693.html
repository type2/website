Paula and I are very happy to announce the birth of
our first child (daughter). Major miracle as both Mom
and Dad were told that we'd never have children.

Audrey Leigh Ellis
Born 01/05/00
17:02 pm
4lbs 13oz _at_ 34 weeks.
As good looking as her mother! =)!
Came just past 5pm, 5th of Jan at 17:02 1+7+2 is
divisible by 5
Did the proper break-in thing. No idling at birth.
Kept her screaming for 10 minutes _at_ 3000 rpm. Then
dropped all fluids. Will keep it in town until 500
mile retorque.

Went into phase two at 4:20 PM hahahahaha!

All fingers and toes accounted for. Quickly got over
that momentary &quot;California Raisin&quot; purple thing. DOH!
If you been there then you know what I mean. 
Mom, Dad and baby are healthy, tired and happy.
Came a little early and was a little small, but turned
out just fine. Thanks for the prayers and support. Mom
and baby due home probably Thurs PM.  Somehow we beat
the odds. Must have been the rocking campout a month
prior to the VW Classic trip. Our private laugh is
that she will ride home in the '54 Ambulance. It's the
only vehicle that we have with seat belts in the rear
at the moment. &lt;Serious&gt;! Poor kid has old hippy
parents.
-Jim and Paula
