Hello Peoples!

I have been having too much fun again today....assembling my front upper
window assemblies, and installing them with all new seals.  Suffice it to
say that I had bad bad luck with the vent wing seal itself (I couldn't find
my VW Appliance #737), and I wanted to re-use my old seals, as they weren't
too nasty, but when I failed getting the window and seal in together and
seated properly, I found myself with a mess of seam sealer and weatherstrip
adhesive...which I tried to clean off with denatured alcohol and lacquer
thinner....which began to eat my new paint!

Yuck.

Anyway, I'll fix that one later!  I got my felts in, and the upright
scraper, and after soaking the big vent flap seal in hot water and then
spraying liberally with silicone, I was able to get it all the way seated
nicely with not too much fuss.  Amazing.  And I only chipped the new paint
in a couple of places.  Grr.  That's the PC version of what I was saying.

I cut out the holes in the frame-to-door seal, and managed to get the frame
into place, and with coercion from the 10mm nuts and some pressure on top, I
got the whole thing seated and bolted in.

So now, just like happened when I did my '60 DC's doors, they are
significantly lower than before, and although they don't contact the lower
part of the jamb in the rear portion (top of dogleg), it's close.  When I
close the door, there's a definite &quot;upswing&quot; to it, and the latch pulls it
up to almost the right place, but there's a lot of pressure on it.

What, may I ask, is the secret?  Why do my doors sag so?  I tried adjusting
the hinges on the DC, but that never helped, and I've got paint and seals
over the screws on the '66, so if there's another way, that's what I want to
do.  I've already grabbed the end of the door and lifted up, but that's not
too wise right now, cuz there's no wheels.....

Help!?

Thanks!

p.s.  I don't know if my problem with practically destroying the &quot;niceness&quot;
of recently restored paint, etc. when reassembling stuff is common, but it
sure makes me feel awful!
