Subject: RE: hot wire at light switch

You will get a reading of zero on most ohm meters or multimeters, analog
or digital, as long as one strand of the wire is still intact.  Most meters
use a very tiny test current (thousandths of an amp) so their batteries
last longer and so you don't burn stuff out when you poke the meter probes
around inside your VCR.  This tiny test current isn't enough to show the
small resistances that can mess you up in low voltage, high current wiring.

As an example, a pair of stock 6012 sealed beams on low beam is designed
to draw 6.26 A at 12.80 V.  The wire from the headlight switch to the
dimmer switch has to carry all this current.  If this wire has a resistance
of 0.1 ohm, it will drop 0.63 V with 6.26 A flowing through it.  It will
also dissipate about 4 watts of power, distributed along its entire
length, which is probably enough to feel if you drive with the low beams
on for a while.

You can measure these low resistances indirectly by passing a high current
through them and measuring the voltage drop across the resistance.  For
instance, turn the low beams on and set your meter to measure a couple of
volts DC.  Put your positive meter probe (carefully) on terminal 56 at the
headlight switch, and your negative meter probe on terminal 56 at the
dimmer switch.  The resulting voltage reading will tell you how much
voltage is being dropped in the white/black stripe wire.

Hand stripes... that's dedication.  Although by matching the original
color code, you have made life much simpler for whoever works on your
Bus next.

&gt;Everything new is color coded correctly [although my white wire is
&gt;bright white, and the original white wire is kind of a dull white ;)]

What?  You didn't set spools of wire out in the weather 40 years ago so
the colors would match?

&gt;I remember a while back I was told you could replace the dimmer switch
&gt;with a new one from a ford truck or something.

That may have been me in http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/062968.html .
&quot;If you want to try a new one I'm fairly sure that the VW one is very
  similar to the one used in older American cars, so you might take yours
  to your FLAPS and see if they have something that will work.  If they're
  being dumb and insist on having a year and model, tell them a '70 Chevy
  or Ford pick-up.&quot;

I suspect that the main problem _might_ be the mounting holes.  I've
seen a few older dimmer switches that have the three push-on connectors,
but the hole centers vary.  If it's a little off, you might be able to
file or drill the switch body to match the Bus.  If it's a lot off, you
might be able to use a thin steel plate with three holes in it.  One
screw goes through the new switch, the steel plate, and into the stock
Bus hole.  Another screw goes through the steel plate and into the other
stock Bus hole.  Another screw (or nut+bolt) goes through the new switch
and the steel plate.

&gt;Is there a reason the headlight wire is not fused?

I'm not sure what &quot;the&quot; answer is.  Some things that could contribute:

- The way most VWs are wired, if you want to fuse _everything_, the
   &quot;main&quot; fuse really needs to be at the starter motor.  Under the car
   is not a great place for a fuse.

- &quot;Don't put all your eggs in one basket&quot; or a single point of failure.
   If there's one fuse for all the headlights, if that fuse blows, you're
   stuck.

- It's cheaper not to have a fuse.

- VW's choice of fuse type limited them to 8 and 16 amp.  (There are 25
   amp pointy-ended fuses, but I wonder if those were a &quot;later&quot;
   development.)  The way the headlight circuit works, it's hard to fuse
   just the headlights - you pretty much have to fuse all of the exterior
   lights.  In a 6 V VW, a 16 A fuse might not have been enough for all
   the lights.

If I was going to fuse the headlight circuits in a Bus, I'd probably
disconnect the battery, then pull the fat red wire(s) off of terminal 30
on the headlight switch.  I'd use a &quot;modern&quot; blade fuseholder with 12
gauge or better wire leads, and put a male push-on on one lead and a
female push-on on the other.  I'd plug the female push-on onto terminal
30 and the male push-on onto the fat red wire(s), then insulate this
push-on joint with tape.  For a 6 V Bus, I'd install a 30 A fuse, and
then put an insulating cap over it.  I'd also have a box of five spare
30 A fuses in the Bus.  For a 12 V Bus, a 20 A or 25 A fuse might be a
better choice - again with a box of five spare fuses in the Bus.

The 6 V Bus really calls for a 40 A fuse, but these are somewhat
non-standard in the blade type fuses.  You can get 40 A fuses in the
bigger fuse cartridges like new cars use, but these aren't available at
every Quick Mart like the blade fuses usually are.
