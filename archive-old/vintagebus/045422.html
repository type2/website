Subject: High Alt Carb Tuning
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

 Hey All,

  I just moved back to Colorado Springs Co from Chattanooga, TN. Today I went 
to get my emissions test done so I could get it registered. I wasn't to 
surprised when it didn't pass. CO was 7.5ppm, legal limit is 5.5ppm. 
  Now let me give you some background as to what I have. I am running a 
Mexican 1600 DP with a new solex 34pict3 carb and 009.I did a tune up so I 
know the timing, dwell and all is fine. I'm fairly certain its a jetting 
problem as I have experienced a loose of power also. I know a lot of it is 
due to the fact I am at 6000 ft above sea level here. What I need to know is 
if anyone has info on rejetting the 34-3 carb for this alt. Of course I would 
need to know the main jet size, air correction, pilot jet and accelerator 
pump setting. Any info would be greatly appreciated.
