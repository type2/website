Subject: Early KDF Logo?

Greetings and Happy New Year,
 
I am working on a project and would like to get ahold of a clean KDF
logo. I am hoping for something similar to the small one shown on the
plate in this photo: http://www.kabriolett_dot_com/stvw/rarest/dish.jpg.
Alternately, I'll take the cog &amp; logo if anybody has one of those.
 
Thanks in advance if anybody out there can help. It's been nearly
impossible to find anything on the 'net or off.
