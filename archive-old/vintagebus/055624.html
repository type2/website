Subject: Re: [VB] Break in oil, cool weather considerations?

&gt;
&gt;We have been wondering about trying to see what the average weather 
&gt;condtions at Wolfburg during these times of year were and come up
&gt;with an accurate idea of what outside temps they used these two
&gt;wieghts of initial break in oil.

Wolfsburg seems to be a little small, but Googling for &quot;Hamburg climate&quot;
(150 km/90 mi northwest) and &quot;Berlin climate&quot; (170 km/100 mi east) yields...

If you want to get really specific, NOAA has global climate data by
latitude and longitude back to 1880.  Write your own program to read
it... :)
