Thank you, Eric&amp;Barb

&gt; Once you slip up the rubber boot you slide up that sheet metal box on  the
&gt; base of the E-brake lever.  Under that is the front ends of the E-brake 
&gt; cables.

I got brave at about 12:30 and removed the sheet metal cover. Just like you 
said. There they where. The pivot pin underneath  was a different story. I 
had to bend out the support ears as the pin was frozen. It was 2:45 am when 
I decided to call it a night. I got everything off the bus (just a rolling 
body now). Next stage is to strip the paint.

I'll post pics soon, what a fun project.
