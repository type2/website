vintageveedub wrote&gt;&gt;&quot;to all on the list i got scamed
by this guy (mr.kdf)  i got a listed as 
nos
36hp case from him that he stated he did not know for
sure if it was 
nos,
but it showed no signs of wear and had old flaking
cosmilne on it.&quot;&lt;&lt;

To list, I am sorry that this unfortunate incident had
to be taken to a public forum such as this. This
person has refused to talk civilly, and refrain from
emailing me threats, and profanity among other things.
I have tried to listen to his side of the story and
make a fair judgement. It seems in truth, there is not
a problem with the case as much as the buyer was
apparently bidding outside of his means. What I am
saying is that he expressed concern over the amount he
had bid, even BEFORE he received the item. I listed
the item with as much info as I knew for sure about
it. I asked that all questions be posed before
bidding. Only two bidders did this, frankiehil being
one of them. When he received the item after I refused
to let him back out of the deal, he immediately said
it was trash. Folks there is no scam here, but rather
maybe a little overzealous bidding on an item in
hindsight. I am sorry that this had to be aired on the
list and I will not perpetuate the argument here.
Thank you for your time.

Stephan Fischer
