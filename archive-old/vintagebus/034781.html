&lt;&lt; Any advice on what metal to use to patch a window sized hole in a panel
 bus? Can I obtain steel from the local metal place, or is it recommended to
 find a boneyard and make off with an appropriately sized chunk? Does the
 German steel make any difference? Thanks.

Your bus won't really know the difference.  You could cut a patch out of a
Yugo hood as long as it's the gauge.  But I think you'll find that most
wrecking yards will be more than happy to sell you part of a roof section for
next to nothing (talking like 5 bucks), just due to the lack of demand.  I
myself like to keep my VW's VW and use only VW metal for patches.  VW metal
just seems to be softer than other manufactures.  It's easier to work with and
just plain feels better.  Your other option is to hit the scrap piles behind
your local VW shop or just about any body shop.  In fact if you were to stop
off at the body shop I work at you could haul away all you want!!
  Peace, Love, and the bus may not know the difference-but you will,
