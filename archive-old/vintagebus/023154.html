&gt;I have one of those as well.... but do the old dealerships keep records back
&gt;to say 59???  And what if the dealership is no longer?

You might be able to find someone who works at a nearby dealership that
remembers the old days.  I would think that VWoA would have a list
*somewhere* of their old dealerships.  Looking specifically in my area (San
Jose) the Jan '65 book shows one dealership, even though I have frames from
at least two or three other dealerships.  It's possible they could have
folded before '65 or cropped up after '65.  &lt;shrug&gt;

Ideally, we need a resource that complies all these dealer and distributors
books with dates...you know, which ones existed in 59 and not in 65...which
ones were around in 65 but not in 82, etc.
