Subject: Vintage parts from VW dealers

Hey Volks

I'll get to the point in the subject line, but a bit of
background first:

Some of you will remember how, a couple of weeks back, a
broken clutch plate cushioning spring led to the engine
seizing up in the Ratmobile, my 75 Fleetline panel. My last
word was that I would replace the clutch plate and reinstall
the engine that weekend.

Well, it started raining the next day and continued to rain
for another four days (this is not usual in these parts) so
I only got back to work on the bus the next week, in between
running my business and my job (to make ends meet until the
business is flying!). The result was that I did the work in
bits and pieces, half an hour here, half there. So when I
put the engine back I was watching the clock and forgot to
route the accelerator cable and bolted engine to trans with
the cable between them. DOH!!

Of course, when I came back to it and unbolted the engine to
release the trapped cable I broke the cable when
straightening it. It had recently broken at the front and I
repaired it with wire as I could not find a new replacement.
A wire fix wasn't an option this time so it was back to the
search for a new one. This time, instead of trying the local
FLAPSes, I called my favourite ACVW parts place and
scrapyard on the other side of town.

They didn't have a new one, but sold me a used one so the
Ratmobile is back on the road at last.

Now to the topic from my subject line:
While I was buying the used cable, the lady behind the
counter asked if I'd tried a VW dealer. I said I had and the
part was listed as NLA. She recommended I try the dealer she
uses to source parts, and said I should speak to a
particular guy at the parts counter.

So I did. The parts were listed as NLA on his fiche as well,
but he knows a bit about how to track down obsolete parts
from the VWSA factory warehouse and said he would find them
for me. I had also recently broken a clutch cable and used
up my last spare, so I asked him to find that as well.

Yesterday he called to say he had the parts!!! He got me two
NOS Brazilian clutch cables (PN 214 721 335 1), and two new
German accelerator cables (PN 214 721 555 P).

The clutch cables are right for my bus (75 Brazilian
Fleetline), but the accelerator cables are too long (but at
least I can use them). Any idea what they are correct for?
The parts man said they're for an &quot;earlier German bus&quot;, but
I think not. The length is 3620mm, whereas my 67 parts list
shows 214 721 555 A, 3564mm, up to chassis 215 036 650 and
214 721 555 C, 3576mm, from chassis 215 036 651. The 214
prefix on part numbers signfies RHD-specific parts.

Anyway, the point of this long tale is don't discount VW
dealers as a source of parts. Yes, everything for our buses
is listed as NLA (if they can even find the fiche!), and
yes, most of the parts guys don't even know that a splittie
is a Volkswagen. But if you can find a parts guy who knows
about ACVWs and is prepared to go the extra mile, you may be
surprised to find what's still lurking in dark corners of VW
parts warehouses.
