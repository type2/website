This is so common yet so crazy if you think about it.......

How much material? Just as much as needed to fit!

Ok the crazy way, here goes!

Take 4 long bolts. Longer then normal bolts that would hold the engine to
the tranny. Bolt the engine to the tranny, engine with the 12 v flywheel on.
No it wont fit, but with the long bolts it will hold itself up against the
tranny. Turn the engine over with a wrench. Tighten bolts. Turn the engine
over again. Tighten botls. Repeat over and over till engine sits in the
place it should. You have now completed a 12v flywheel to 6v tranny. Gosh
this sounds crazy doesnt it? But it has been done many times over, and it is
just plain nuts, but it works. The 6v starter should be looked at as 12v
starter bushings are different if you swap that out. 

Wow, I give this info, but I still dont like the chevy conversion? What the
hell is wrong with me? I guess that this requires no welding and actually, a
&quot;bushed out&quot; tranny can still be a 6v tranny if someone wanted it to be.
