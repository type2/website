Subject: re: GOLDE

Just picked up a sunroof for the '65 deluxe. It'll need some working
over, but while I wait for parts and a Bently manual, I have one
question.  Why does it say &quot;Golde&quot; on the handle?  It's a chrome handle
with two major pieces, the handle pivots away from the center. Is this
stock? Who or what is Golde? Auf Deutsch for Sky?

Golde is the company VW used to make their fold back sunroofs.  As far
as I know they were the only manufacture that VW used.  I think they
were also a German company but not sure on that one.
