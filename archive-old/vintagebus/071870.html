&gt; It had no problems all week...so we are on the way up a long hill, when I
&gt; see some smoke in my rear view mirror, and my oil light come on. So I pull
&gt; over, and see the valve cover on the passenger side is leaking all over the
&gt; heater box...so I am thinking I must not have put the valve cover on
&gt; properly, or maybe a bad gasket...

Hi Kevin,
Was the gasket off at the top??  The 1970s valve covers are much better 
because they have a dimple in the top of them just under the center/top of the 
gasket there.

&gt;  so I pull over...check the engine-and the brass fitting on the fuel pump 
&gt; has come out, gas all over the engine compartment. I think=no big deal, this 
&gt; happened with my squareback...I rough up the edge(kind of like knurling)...and 
&gt; tap it back in. It feels nice and tight.

Make sure to also center punch around all the brass tube fuel line fittings 
in the fuel pump and carb to help prevent this!!  Good to hear it did not catch 
fire!!!!

&gt; I open the engine lid, and see a chunk of the engine...sitting on top of 
&gt; the engine...it looks like a chunk of the engine case. I now realize I screwed 
&gt; up big time. I should have stopped at the first signs of trouble...I believe 
&gt; I did what I have heard as &quot;throwing a rod&quot;...not really sure though.

Yes!!  That is what a connecting rod will do when it breaks loose of the 
piston.

&gt;  I may see if he'll give me the engine in lieu of some of the money he owes 
&gt; me.
&gt; Will this engine work? I am thinking a short term solution while I work on 
&gt; making an more ideal engine. 

With the proper bus muffler, carb jetted for your muffler and air cleaner, it 
should work after you fix any &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; stuff on it.

&gt; What I don't understand is how the problem could have happened, considering 
&gt; how much time I spend babying this thing...regular tune ups, added an oil 
&gt; filter/pump...synthetic oil...constantly checking the thing out, and aargh...it 
&gt; is frustrating. I am wondering if I had stopped at the first sign of 
&gt; trouble, would it have been able to save the engine? Or did it probably need a tear 
&gt; down anyway....

By the time you got the oil pressure light it was too late.  Which is why we 
will only run our VWs with oil pressure and temp gauges.  These will show one 
problems well before the idiot light does.  We have saved several engines by 
having these!  If you had just gotten a tow after the oil light you would have 
saved the engine case, and the connecting rods and crank from major damage, 
but still needed a rebuild.  Even if you had pulled over and gotten a tow just 
after hearing the rattle you would have saved those parts.  At least with your 
oil filter your oil cooler is clean of the metal shavings that suddenly came 
loose in there.
