&gt;&gt;Can anyone tell me more about the NZ camper that was at BBB4?  Any other

I've talked to the guy a couple of times. His name is Gary and I thought I
saw him come up for the Listee photo, but I can't spot him in any of the
pix. Maybe he's a lurker? Anyway, I'm sure he'll be around...very nice guy,
more than willing to fill in the details!
