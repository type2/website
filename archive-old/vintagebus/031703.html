I have a set of OG Plexiglas BD corner windows, how should I polish them?
I use a product called PLEXIS, this helped clear them up and make shine but
still have some scratchs. Plexis is a product used by marine and aircraft
industry for eisenglass and lexan windows, it really works!

The Post-War &quot;VW&quot; is not the same company as the Pre-War KDF factory.

I highly recommend getting one of the better VW books and reading up
on the history; some of the Keithe Sueme books have a really good 
chronology.  Specifically look for the names &quot;Ivan Hirst,&quot; 
&quot;Heinz Nordhoff&quot; and &quot;Ben Pon&quot;
