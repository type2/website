Subject: Re: [VB] Re: The value of this list

I'm the air-cooled mechanic at the shop where I work. One day last year,
I had to go to the dealer to pick up a part for one of the watersuckers
we were working on, and I drove my '67, with the safaris wide open, and
one of the technicians there said &quot;What the hell is that?&quot;... Another
tech there said, &quot;That's a REAL Volkswagen.&quot; 

Just shows ya... Those guys don't know jack she-ite about real VWs...

Incidently... I had to find a bushing for carb linkage on a '74 Westy. I
went to the dealer and asked them about it, and they didn't have a clue.
I got the part number from a friendly listee, and tried again. This time
I got it. I don't think they even use their microfische anymore. If you
need a part from the dealer, give them the part number, you will
probably have better luck that way...
