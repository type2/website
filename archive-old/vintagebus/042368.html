&gt; &lt;&lt; Hi again!
&gt;  The PO converted my 66 6V to 12V generator.  It doesn't appear that any
&gt;  of the electrical system (except coil, regulator, etc.) are switched and
&gt;  I don't find any step downs.  Everything is stripped from the rig.  How
&gt;  can this be?  I don't understand how all this stuff can still run (like
&gt;  lights) with 6V bulbs...

Are you _sure_ its a 12v generator.  66 busses had a one year only 6 volt
generator that was the same size as a 12 volt generator.

If all your bulbs/relays etc. are still 6v with no stepdown, i'd bet you
have the original generator and not a 12v unit.

peas,

Steve
