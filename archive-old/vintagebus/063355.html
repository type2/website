Subject: Re: [VB] Oil temperature - Alternative sender?

&gt;From: Adrian Pillow &lt;Apillow_at_manh_dot_com&gt;

&gt;The oil temperature sender was put in place of the oil pressure relief
&gt;bolts (I use the word bolt very loosely here).

I don't know of a source for this ready-made but it seems like it would
be an easy thing for a machine shop to make.  Probably they'd need to
turn some round bar stock down to the right OD, tap the OD to match
the case threads, and then drill and tap it to match a standard oil
temp sender thread.  I'd take them a standard &quot;bolt&quot; so they could
match the thread and spring-seat dimensions.

If you try to have the &quot;bolt&quot; slotted like the original, it might be
hard to get the oil temp sender hole in the middle of the slot to
seal.  It might be better to have the &quot;bolt&quot; made with a hex head or
at least wrench flats so the sender will seal and you can get it out
later.
