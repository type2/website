&lt;&lt; anyway - i found a book that i thought was  for notch backs - but it
appears not - can anyone tell me about 411's - that book i found says:
Workshop Manual for Volkswagen 411 and 411 LE 1968-72.  So what were these
things? - &gt;&gt;
Hi Jdd,
VW introduced the type 3 in 1961 as the notch/round/square backs with a type
3 1500cc engine. This 1500cc engine size was optional in 1963 and standard
for the USA buses from 1964-67.  In 1964 you could get the type 3 with a
1600cc engine in Europe and the bus with a 1300cc engine for better MPG since
they had and still have way higher gas prices than here in the USA.  Then in
1968 VW introduced the type 4 as the notch/round/square backs using the same
engine that was installed into the 1972 and later buses.  Unfortunitly VW had
redesigned the type 3 body designs for the type 4 with what amounted to using
an ugly stick and square bumpers on them.  The type 4 VWs were a extreme
dissappointment for VW due to low sales and about 1974 they discontinued
production of this line of VW.     Eric&amp;Barb
