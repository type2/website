&lt;&lt;List- Please help me to answer this question (its bring driving me crazy
for
several years now): you know panels,kombis, standards,and probably others
were equipped with rubber bumpers mounted to the side of the vehicle that
served to protect the body from damage when one of the vehicle doors was
opened AND were also equipped with check straps on the side cargo doors. On
the other hand, DeLuxe buses were equipped with the check strap ONLY to
obviously protect the side of the vehicle (in this case the aluminum
beltline molding) from damage. Now my question- why were the non-DeLuxe
buses equipped with BOTH rubber bumpers AND check straps???&gt;&gt;

Simple answer. I think that in the case of my 67 Kombi, it was fitted with
both to protect the popout wondow and front cargo door from whacking the
front door when the passenger gets in and out. Countless times the rear
passenger has gotten out before the front one and wham! the doors hit. Now
with the strap and bumper, i'm happy either way.
