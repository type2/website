Subject: H30/31 carb questions

Well, no takers over on t2, so I'll bug you folks :)

I am replacing my 30PICT1 on the 70 (suspect it has bushing leaks) and
trying out the 30/31 as per many folks recommendations; my questions are:
which of the two pilot jets goes in which hole? There are two jets (on RH
side of carb, one facing more to the back), a 90.55 and a 90.65, but they
were out when I got the carb and don't know which circuit gets which jet -
or if it matters.
I put the bigger one in the rear orifice for the hell of it for now......
Next, how to adjust the beast?
Adjusting the big idle screw on the throttle arm works to an extent, but I
have to screw the thing in almost all the way.  And turning the idle
mixture screw seems to yield no results at all (and yes, carb has been
tanked and cleaned).  Let's not even discuss the great big screw lurking
just next to it!
Main jet is a 125,  engine is a 1600, carb is a 009 while I rebuild some
others to play with.


I can adjusta 26-30 pict1,2,3, a 34pict3 and even a Rochester, but this
thing is wiggy. TWO pilot jets???
