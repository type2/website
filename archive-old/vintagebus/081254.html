Subject: Re: [VB] 6 V halogens

Seems to me there was a thread on the samba that had to do with 6V H4 bulbs 
I was reading the other day. It had to do with running Porsche lenses with 
the h4 conversion. I haven't been able to find the dang thing since though.

Mark

&gt;&gt;As far as I know, nobody makes halogen 6 V sealed beams.
&gt;
&gt; Google knows all.  Halogen 6006 sealed beams might be available from
&gt; Grote; I have e-mailed them.  Sylvania appears to claim that their 6006s
&gt; are halogen, even though they don't have the &quot;H&quot; part number; I have
&gt; e-mailed them too.
