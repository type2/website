Subject: Re: [VB] Happy 35th Bday

Seeing as my DC turned 40 this year...he's having a bit of a mid life
crisis currently.  Keeps mumbling something about a Porsche 6 cyl.
conversion and red paint and 4 wheel disc brakes.  The owner is only a
few years away from 40 and will be deep in the middle of an age induced
crisis soon enough. :-)
