&gt; &quot;Give 'em enough rope &amp; they will hang themselves&quot;

See, now this here is the problem. All that dang rope I smoked when I wuz
young has rendered my memory into a wretched and leaky thing. If'n I hadn't
been puffing away on them there lefty cigarettes I would be able to remember
everything and woudn't need no archives. I guess I'll take some gingko
biloba to get me through. Maybe mix in a littleViagra so I can remember what
the f___ I am doing. I already miss the archives. Now I can't go back and
read Clara's snowflake &quot;trip&quot; report.

The acid in a sody is an ingredient. It is there for two reasons. Flavor and
safety. Believe me, they only wash a sody plant about once a month, the
sanitizer residue isn't enough to account for it. It is added to lower the
pH so the product can safely be stored at room temperature. When you can
products you must either heat process the product to kill all spore forming
bacteria, add chemicals to retard mold and bacteria such as sodium benzoate
and potassium sorbate, or lower the pH to below 4.6 so that the bacteria can
not form spores. The spores and the chemicals they produce are what kill
folks, bacteria just makes you a little ill provided you are an otherwise
healthy bus owner. The acid content is why so many bus floors rot out. DPO
dumps a 64 ounce big gulp during a panic stop. Then, he opens his door and
hangs a sweeping right turn so most of the sody and all the ice cubes run
out. The floor is all sticky so when he gets home he wipes the rubber mat
off with a pair of chonies he finds in the garage, but he doesn't get under
the mat because the chonies are full. The acid eats at all of the bare metal
squares caused by the waffles on the mat rubbing on them. Lather, rinse,
repeat. Soon, the floor gives way. Then, he sells it to you. Another bus
with the &quot;usual rust&quot;.
