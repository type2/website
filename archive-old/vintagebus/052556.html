Subject: Re: [VB] Help Installing Deep Oil Sump

&gt; I am trying to install a deep oil sump from Bugpack, and was hoping to have
&gt; some help in two areas:
&gt;
&gt; 1. How do I get those studs for the oil drain cover plate out (so I can put
&gt; the new, longer ones in?

You could try the two nut trick.  Put two nuts on the stud, put the first on on
just enough to make room for the second one.  Screw the second nut onto the
stud and then tighten the two nuts together.

You can then use the bottom nut to put the wrench on and turn the stud out of
its hole.
