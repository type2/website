yup, that Arctic Air came down to Oly, WA, too.     I am doing nothing special
about it,   I have 10/40 in the engine case.   I am now wearing gloves and my
winter coat, and should throw the tire chains in the bus just in case.     Yes
it does like to warm up a bit before shifting.        Actually, after I've
driven 15 min the heater starts doing something noticable, but I'm already
there.    

VW made pecial engine bearing for arctic climates.  If you move to somewhere
really permanently cold, you may want some.  I haev some in my 53, as they
were the nly std/std 25/36hp main bearing I could find.  Differentalloy, alloy
that center bearing is split too.
