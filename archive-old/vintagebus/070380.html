Subject: 30 PICT 1 - vs 28 PICT 1

So .... a few questions about the 30 PICT 1.  I have a 28 PICT 1 on my bus and
I get about 31 mpg (Imperial Gals.)  My motor is, I think it's called, a big
bore 40 hp.  I think it is 1400 cc.  So given that the 28 PICT was made for a
1200 cc motor maybe I should have a slightly bigger carb on my 1400 cc motor.
A local guy had a 30 PICT 1 that I got and he assured me that it is a good
carb.

What's the story on those carbs.  What motor were they used for?

The coil dealy in the automatic choke is broken on my 28 PICT - could I just
pull that out and put the automatic choke coil dealy in the 28 from the 30?

My 28 PICT never did have power going to it and I see that the 30 PICT 1 has
two places for power - whoa - from where should the power come for the 30 PICT
- and why 2?

TIA
