&gt;
&gt;Here is my flashing hazard light woes: I own a 67 21DLX. When I pull the
&gt;hazard knob out, the front two lights flash on and off. However, the back
&gt;two lights do not flash on and off. This happens with or without the
&gt;head/tail lights on or off.  The turn signals, head lights/ tail lights,
&gt;brake lights and everything light wise function with no problems. I just
&gt;don't have flashing in the rear when knob is pulled out.

If the two red (16 amp) fuses are OK, then the trouble probably is
in or around your nine prong box.  The wire from the brake light
switch on the master cylinder goes &quot;through&quot; this box - normally,
when you step on the brakes, the &quot;brake in&quot; wire (54) is connected
to the &quot;brake out&quot; wire (54F), which then goes to your turn signal
switch and on to your rear lights.  When you have the hazard
flashers on, the box internally connects the &quot;brake out&quot; wire
(54F) to battery voltage whenever the front lights are on, so the
rear lights flash -- as if you were stepping on the brake pedal
in time with the front lights.

You may want to check and make sure that everything is correctly
connected at your nine prong box.  In particular, these connections:

15 - battery voltage only with key on
30 - battery voltage all the time
54 - when the wire on 54 is unplugged from the box, the wire has 
     battery voltage when you step on the brakes
54F - when the wire on 54f is unplugged from the box, it has
      no voltage on it, but it makes the brake lights come on if
      it is jumped to the wire on terminal 30
ground - case of the box is well grounded

If all the wiring checks out you may want to think about a new
nine prong box.  Or, you can use an external relay along with
your semi-broken box to perform the missing function.

Good luck!
