Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch loose all of a sudden (continued) 

&lt;&lt;Well, I tightened the wing nut about an inch or so. (that is much 
adjustment compared to past of one turn or two) Getting some resistance at 
clutch.Cranked engine with clutch out. OK.. Try to push clutch in to hear 
that bad sound of something scrubbing against a moving part.&gt;&gt;

Hi Raymond,
Sounds like your throw out bearing came off the TO arm or more likely the new 
TO arm failed due to being not bead welded where the TO bearing arms meet the 
shaft.

 &lt;&lt;Arggggh.I will have to get it towed or something.&gt;&gt;

Why?  Is the clutch slipping?  You should be able to drive it without a 
clutch pedal in quite traffic, double clutching in the upper three gears.  
Get out your &quot;Idiots Manual&quot; and read up on how.

&gt;&gt; Just had new clutch two thousand miles ago. (For any that remember my 
mechanic couldn't figureout the drums were out of tolerance and I kept 
loosing all brakes because the left rear slave cylinder would come apart. He 
also replaced my clutch due to a broken clutch actuation fork)Any Ideas 
????Any idea how to pacify a wife frustrated with an old VW?  &lt;&lt;

Yes, do the work yourself and do it right instead of paying someone to do it 
wrong!
