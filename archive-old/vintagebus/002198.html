reply to Andre Hyn-
i was thinking you were looking for the starter bushing which supports
the starter in the trans, ( and you may want to check that one as well )
but now i think you are looking for the &quot; bendix drive &quot; on the starter,
which you probably can't buy separately as new, but could replace
from a used starter which has a bad winding or other defect. if this part
is defective, you may also want to examine the flywheel teeth. if you are
testing the starter on the bench, you must realize that the armature must be
supported just as it is when installed, and will short if you attempt to apply
voltage unless it is . the term &quot;throw-out bearing&quot; , which  technically is the
function of the &quot; bendix drive &quot; , is more often applied to the clutch release bearing.

&gt;Now here comes the time to get this starter going and got a problem. Bearing
&gt;on my starter is beat-up. Is there a replacement bearing available for a 6V
&gt;starter? There might not be too much of a difference between 6 and 12V but
&gt;that's what I have. I think it's called throw-out bearing if I'm not
&gt;mistaken.
