Subject: RE: [VB] gettin' of the grease/mud

I bought a couple of those big RubberMade tubs and use a couple of gals of
mineral spirits. After cleaning that way I then use real soapy water and
spray it down with the garden hose and dry off.

If you have the time, simply soak them in hot water and soap.

Otherwise, use solvents made for degreasing

You don't need high temp paint, but if you go to bare metal you really
need to degrease well, prime, and paint to get the paint to stick.  Try to
preserve the original paint if you can!

&gt; If there is no reasonable way and I go sandblast them, do I need to use

hotter the engine tin? I know I should powder coat them but....
