&lt;&lt; I should shut up now, but I might as well say one more thing.  Other than
 the Ebay stuff, I find Kabayo's other posts are of value and usually
 entertaining.  But.....  Kabayo, is there any chance you'd please consider
 deleting that stupid political header at the end of your messages?  That
 truely has absolutely nothing to do with this list, and many of us don't
 really appreciate being preached to about non-Bus related, political crap. 
 Please consider the rest of us and drop that header in the future.   &gt;&gt;

WOOHOO...Preach it Bill.  Amen to nixing that signature.  Bill for 
President........oh wait, he already is.
