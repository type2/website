Subject: Re: [VB] engine ID &amp; air cleaner on a 1961

&gt;From: &quot;Martin&quot; &lt;mcmmd_at_ev1_dot_net&gt;

&gt;
&gt;I have several questions! My 1961 double cab has a later model engine
&gt;but I can't quite figure out what it has; there are no numbers on the
&gt;case.

None at all?  Are there even any letters on the surface below the
generator stand where the numbers would usually be?  As I understand
it, replacement cases were not marked with a serial number, but did
have the letter prefix of the series they came from, so you would know
what parts would fit it later on.

You might look around some more.  Look over on the left side below
the fuel pump and distributor.  Look along the case seam on top of
the engine, between the fuel pump and the generator stand - if you
have a Type 3 case the engine number might be there.  Also look
underneath on the sides of the oil sump - the part number and country
of origin are often cast in there.

&gt;My air cleaner is on the left side, but the opening in the sheet metal
&gt;(breast plate) for the hose that comes down from the air intake port,
&gt;is on the right side of the engine.

Left-side air cleaner is correct for a '61.  It sounds like you may
have a later breast plate in there.  On my '64, the air cleaner is
on the right (stock).  The hole in the tin for the pre-heater tube
for the air cleaner, though, is on the left.  There is a small metal
tube bolted to one of the left side muffler studs on the head.  The
pre-heater tube slips over this, then goes through the hole in the
tin to the &quot;top side&quot; of the engine.  It is secured by a half-round
clamp right in back of the crankshaft pulley, and then curves up to
attach to the intake snout of the air cleaner.  The pre-heater tube
on mine is obviously a later replacement; it is rubber and looks like
a fat (water-cooled) heater hose or a skinny radiator hose.  I have
a book with an original picture of a '63 that shows this tube as
a corrugated cardboard one, like the fresh air hoses, but smaller in
diameter.

You might take a look at the '58-'67 parts manual at
http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part.html .  Pages 85, 87,
and 89 have the diagrams, and page 95 gives the following info:

111 119 523 A  36 HP  (through 1959 model year)
113 119 527 C  40 HP  (1960 through 1962 model years)
113 119 523 A  40 HP  (starting with 1963 model year)
113 119 523 F  1500   (starting mid-66, preheat hole must be blocked off) 

This last part number is called out as A 43 on page 87 and has the
pre-heat hole on the left.  It is also called out as B 44 on page 89
and has the pre-heat hole on the right.  But both call-outs go to the
same part number...  Also on page 87, A 49 is the clip that holds the
hose in back of the crankshaft pulley. 
 
&gt;What is this hose actually for

It provides warm intake air to the engine to help it run better when
very cold and to warm up quicker.

&gt;Also the weighted flap valve on my air cleaner is broken off. Are there
&gt;any major problems that could occur becasue this valve is missing?

Page K-2 1 (third paragraph from the bottom) and page K-2 15 (top
left column) in your FLVTWM.

&gt;Did the 1961 come with a 1200 or 1300?

Stock was a 1200.

I hope this helps!
