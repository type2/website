&gt;1. I'm clueless as to what to bring,

 Well one year a guy  brought a water tank in the back of his double cab
which he used to fill up the above ground POOL he brought, and was praised
for it. Next year a guy brought some fireworks and was almost beat up for
it. Another year a guy brought a TV and VCR and got a few laughs. some ppl
also like to bring along one of those skimply dressed, Gstring wearin,
Girlfriend's....no comment on that though =)
You never know what ppl will bring to jerome. All I'd suggest is a hackey
sack,  and money for the raffle. Thats all you really need anyways .
just my 2 ¢
