&lt;&lt;Clara &amp; I are planning on going to the Hessisch Oldendorf VW meet on the 
middle of June.

We plan to spend two weeks in Germany and want to try to plan our time well. 
We could just spend our time in sidewalk cafes drinking bier &amp; cafe, but 
might be more ambitious.
Does anyone know of shows in Europe either the weekend before or the weekend 
after to allow better use of time in Germany.
We plan to go to the Wolfsburg museum as well, because that is close to 
Hanover.
