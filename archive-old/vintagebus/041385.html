&gt; The other thing I found is it is much nicer to use the sandwich style shift

&gt; Cause the way the trans attaches has less rubber mount bits, and the 
&gt; vibrations can be loud.   Split case buses are harder to change the shift 
&gt; coupler on than the May 20 59 through early 66 buses. cause of the linkage, 
&gt; so tranny out is the easiest time. 

I was thinking of this myself being right in the middle of it.  I have a
new style in front and old style in rear.  It's real hard to get the rear
set screw out in the rear coupler.  I think a 9mm 12 point fits it.  I
think maybe an 8mm crow's foot would be handy here. The old style coupler
will not pass through the mount opening.  I tried.  I'm thinking I'll move
the new style to the rear, then the old style up front to allow for a
little less noise.  I don't know if it will be noticeable as I'm using the 
solid front adapter mount for the nosecone.
