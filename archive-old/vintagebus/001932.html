Aside from the funny comments, I just completed this fiasco myself on a 66
Crew cab.  IMHO, here's what you need to do.  I paid about $150 for all the
parts to completely replace my entire brake system.  Small price to pay for
making sure your bus stops when you want it to.

All numbers are approximate -

E-brake cables - 2 (2 rear)
Wheel cylinders - 6 (4 front, 2 rear)
Brake hoses - 4 (2 front, 2 rear)
Brake shoes - 8 (4 front, 4 rear)
Brake spring kit - 2 (1 front, 1 rear)
Misc seals/gaskets - 4 (2 front, 2 rear)
Hard barke lines - 5 (2 front, 1 long a$$ one to go from front to rear, 2
rear)
Tee fitting - 2 (1 front, 1 rear)
Master cylinder - 1 (mine was single chamber)
Reservoir - 1
Cap - 1
Brake switch - 1
Brake fluid - 1 liter (don't get the racing stuff, just normal DOT-3 works
best on the street)

Optioanl stuff (upon inspection, felt they were ok)
Drums - had them turned, the lining is good for a long time to come!
