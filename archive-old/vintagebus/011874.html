 This is going to be about Vacuum Tuning . . .  ? ? ? ?

While I figure that out I'll mention that I was out pursuing 
knowledge, the ever evasive boojum . . . . . about the crankshaft
&quot;balance&quot; thing . . .

I'm not very good at interviewing and I was trying to get some info 
from &quot;Mr D&quot;, the local balancer . . . can't go back there again . . :-)   I
got impatient with his lack of sparkling dialogue . .
never mind . . I considered burning him out of his office where he 
had retreated for sanctuary of a pretend phone call . .

I'm being &quot;still&quot; tho, still have that other felony assault pending.

Hell, that's the good news . . . the other two guys I'm told to see
are both dead . . .  :-)

I could be wrong but Mr D just uses that machine . . . .

Vacuum Tuning . . . when you think about it, it's obvious . . .

You got a set of duals for example , , standard procedure says use
a &quot;Uni-syn&quot; or some other device . . . what is this uni-syn device
reading?   Flow rate would be a good answer but Vacuum is more correct. 

 To read an air-flow rate directly, you would have a vane
propellor right in the flow path . . not cool so it is read indirectly
with a pitot tube or in our case an orfice on the carb side versus
an opening to the atmosphere on other side of ball thing . . 

So we're looking for max flow rate . . strange as it may seem, that's
where you are drawing the max vacuum . . .

 So you do one side to  max and then match the other. . . and you have
graduations of at least 30 inches vac. . . .

 Some, by now, see that you can also tune a single carb this way . .

 In this case, you're just looking for the max vacuum . . .

 I leave finding a source of manifold vacuum as one of those &quot;student
exercises&quot; . .  :-) anywhere below the throttle plate but as long as 
you're just looking for a &quot;max&quot;, it shouldn't matter where you get it.

 Still &quot;pushing back the dark&quot;   west
