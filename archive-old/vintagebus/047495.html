&lt;&lt;  My novice bus logic tells me to retorque the muffler (its a cheasy 4 tip 
monza type) and possibly replace the muffler gaskets.  Any other ideas.   &gt;&gt;

Hi Eric,
As long as there is no gaps in the tubing and heater mufflers, from the 
heaters to the body all should be fine there.  As for the Monza muffler get 
rid of it.  The reason VW went to the bus only muffler in the late 50s  was 
to get the exhaust out to the left corner and off into the stream of air 
passing by the side of the bus.  With the Monza muffler you now have this 
exhaust in a cloud behind your bus and getting into any crack into the engine 
comparment and interior.  Through either/or the rear hatch seal due to the 
lower air pressure at highway speeds especially or the heating system due to 
the cooling fan sucking in the fumes around the engine tin and/or the engine 
lid seals.    Eric&amp;Barb
