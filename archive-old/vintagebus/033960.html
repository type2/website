 Can anyone out there tell me the difference between the
 early (prior to 61) and late (61-64) flip out handle style
 front doors?
  &gt;&gt;
the early doors are flat whger ethe hole for the handle is.  The later ones 
have the indentation.    Thus the base of the handle was changed to adapt to 
this.
