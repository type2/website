Subject: HELP: swamp coolers
Message-ID: &lt;7mfneu$kkfd_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Does anyone know anything about swamp coolers. (They use water and a
fan blows over it)
Can you make a version of that for a Volkswagen bus?
They are much better than air conditioners for they don't take much
electricity.
I will probably never check this message again, so please e-mail me at
