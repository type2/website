Subject: 1962-1966 Bus

I am looking for a 1962-1966 Microbus, Deluxe-23 (or deluxe-21), or
Camper to Restore.  If anyone is in the NJ, NY, etc. area, please send
an email.  This is going to be one of my first restoration jobs, so
please if you have a bus that you are willing to sell, i am looking for
one in decent shape.  I am also going to need documents to help me
restore this, so if you have anything that would help me to restore
these 3 busses, please e-mail me...thanks.
