Subject: Re: [VB] Decisions, Decisions... Found a restorable '67
Message-ID: &lt;38123AFB.DB1DFCE_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

&gt;
&gt; I thought that the &quot;M-code&quot; plate was located behind the driver's seat...
&gt; looked and saw none.  saw no paint marks, tho that would have indicated
&gt; removal, nor rivet holes.

Its on the passenger side

&gt; Other than the Master cylinder and turn signal box, what are the '67 only
&gt; parts?
&gt;

Dash, 12V radio, black dash and radio knobs, 67 only fuel tank (a bit
bigger), 66/67 dimmer on turn signal stalk.  A few more but I can't remember.

&gt;
&gt; I don't think this is the deluxe interior... bed/seat in the back and
&gt; seat/cooler cabinet behind the divider with a flip up table between.
&gt; &quot;Spice rack&quot; on the rear double door, tho.  What is it?  SO-wise?

That is still the SO-42 interior...pop-top or not.  Officially A42 if it
didn't come with a tent or rack.

The interior and 67 bits as well as the rest of the salvageable parts might
net you the 5 hundred back if it is too far gone to save.

I just bought a bus almost identical to this except the interior is in great
shape and the nose is smashed.  It will eventually become the donor bus for
my 65 pop-top project.  Till then I'm going to drive her as a 3rd car for
back ups and around town.  I've put about $250 in her so far just to get her
safe and sound as a driver.  We'll see how it all goes.  Besides, I didn't
have the heart to part her out and crush her...yet.  Thank God we don't have
inspections out here in CA, it would never pass.  This bus came from Colorado
via ID.  I call her RB.  Short for &quot;Rust Bucket&quot;!

Good luck with your decision.  You're at the beginning of a VERY long road,
as I'm sure you know.

Steve.
