Subject: Re: [VB] Dating a tranny

Hi Jdd,
Well you might try a bottle of gear oil.  Flowers will get you nowhere.

&lt;&lt; I wish I knew what year bus it can from.  Do all pre-63 transaxles have 36 
mm nuts at the hubs? When I look in the Bentley the picture of the brakes 
looks like the 230 mm drum and not like the 250 mm drum - does this help with 
year identification?&gt;&gt;

The 1963 only accessory M215 one ton suspension used the small type 1 and up 
into early 64 small axle nut, 1955-early 64 bearings and used a special one 
year early style stub axle with 1964-67 RGB gearing.

&lt;&lt;  The number on the transaxle in my bus B with 7 digits, while the one I 
plan on installing is H with 7 digits - does this mean the mystery tranny is 
made after mine? &gt;&gt;

Bus boys had a really good chart on trannies which we can not find our copy 
right now.
