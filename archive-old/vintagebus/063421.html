&gt;In 59, the wire harness was sheathed in the typical pvc tubing.
&gt;I've found the supplier that the wire werks gets there stuff from but 
&gt;there is no way I could fathom ordering up a 250 foot spool when all
&gt;I need is a few feet. [...] Anyone else have any suggestions????

The local electronics distributor has Alpha brand non-shrink PVC tubing
in clear, black, and white.  They have it in 24 gauge all the way up to
2.5 inches.  The 24 gauge is $3/100 ft and 0.625&quot; is $33/100 ft.  The
bigger sizes are on 50 ft rolls: .75&quot; $30/50 ft to 2.5&quot; $193/50 ft.
The biggest size on a Bus is probably the bundle right below the fuse
box which is about 1&quot; or so, which is $45/50 ft.  Your local distributor
should have similar stuff.
