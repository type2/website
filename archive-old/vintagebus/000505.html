Hi Thom,
Yes that would be 11NOV59.  Up to DEC55 VW used the end of the year to mark 
the change in model years.  1955 model year started about 01JAN55, and for 
the first time changed at about 01AUG55 to start the 1956 model year.  Yes 
1955 model year only lasted about 7 months for VW.  After all no one wants or 
wanted last years model of automobile.  So if the model year starts the first 
of AUG of the previous year all of the stock can be moved, and sold before 
the next year starts.  Eric&amp;Barb
