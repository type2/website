&gt;Josh was considering buying it before he passed away. 

What ever happened with Josh's VW's (he found a small stash with a few
trucks I believe)? I don't want this to be taken the wrong way. I've got
plenty and OK is too far for me to go at this point considering the
projects I've already got. I was just always curious what ever happened to
his VW's and felt kind of wierd about asking. 

I still have the messages we were exchanging right before he died. I was
gonna trade him a 6-pack for some large spoon pop-out latches. Pretty cool
dude. Had some good chats with him via email. Never met him in person.
