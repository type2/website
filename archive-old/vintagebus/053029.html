&gt; Tar will stain fresh paint, if you leave it on.  Old
&gt; paint it does not stain. 
&gt;   I know this from swapping the safari window in and
&gt; out of my 61 (when it 
&gt; has the stationary windsheild, it gets the roofing
&gt; tar)  Also when I took my 
&gt; 65 apart to paint it there was no stain from where I
&gt; had tarred it 3? years 
&gt; before.   Reinstalled the windsheilds in the 65 a
&gt; few days- maybe 5 after 
&gt; painting the white, cleaned off the tar, no stains
&gt; that I have seen.   But I 
&gt; have seen stains on paint where the area had been
&gt; rattled canned, then really 
&gt; soon (a day or less)windows installed, and the tar
&gt; not cleaned up for weeks.
