I've been following this thread with great interest because, as some of you
may know, I'm an incurable speed freak.  It's not my fault that I happen to
love buses as much as I love speed :-).  That's why I've got the 5-speed
tranny in my 73 Westy - so I can cruise down the highway at 75-80 mph and,
on occasion, crank it up to triple digits (open stretches of interstate
ONLY) to fly past suvs and Lexuseses just for fun.

I built a nice, strong 1776 for my 58 single cab and treated it to a pair of
Weber 40 IDFs so I could be sure and get really crappy gas mileage.  And let
me tell you, that puppy will move!  But what's been bugging me is the
severely limited top end (and the fact that even with all that torque I
still find 3rd gear before I'm all the way across a big intersection).  I
make about 67 MPH (tested to be accurate) at about 4000 RPM with 26.5&quot;
diameter tires and I know I have (or at least paid for) a 4.125 R&amp;P and that
pretty much corresponds to the speed/rev table that was posted.

But what I'm wondering is, what is that 3.44 R&amp;P listed in the table?  And
for that matter, the 3.875?  Where do you find such things?  As long as
you've got the power to push a bus with that taller gearing, are there any
drawbacks?
