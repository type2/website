And what, may I ask, are wrong with pop rivets?!
Damn Rex, you're from Texas...those little bastards rank up there with JB 
Weld, baling wire and duct tape...sheesh.....no really...why not save the 
headache and pop rivet em in..I've never had any problems..hell I'll bet my 
Bosch drill can drill em out just as fast as you can wrench them little nuts 
and bolts off...

 Wrong, when I got my bus, there were some clips that were nut and bolted on, 
 the head of the little bolt goes on the drum side of the wheel. Speaking of 
 this, recently I saw the tool for holding the rivets while you smash them 
for 
 something like $45.00, and also heard that you can get the clips through the 
 dealer for $.75 each.
