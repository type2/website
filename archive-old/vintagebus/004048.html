It would appear that, most probably, the wafers are worn to a point that
they are not being held by the handle casting while in the locked position.
I normally replace worn wafers and springs, along with a complete cleaning
and lubrication in these situations.  For those not familiar with me, I'm a
registered locksmith specializing in VW and British cars.  I also offer
repairs and services by mail, and offer members of this list, the type 2
list, and Vanagon list discounted prices on services.  Feel free to visit
the Vanagon site for recommendations, and my web site at
http://www.steveslockshop_dot_com.  I'll be happy to answer any other VW lock
questions you might have.  My mobile shop is also at VW shows in Texas and
Louisiana.
