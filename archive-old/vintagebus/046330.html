yep same problem, same 66 converted, same flicker, except after a story that
would reach back too far into the past, I R&amp;R'd the generator that had got me
to maine and back last month, because my &quot;D+&quot; post had become unattached to
the internal wire  on the road I had fished it out of the hole and using some
mechanics wire to lengthen it, wrapped it around the D+ post and it served me
well for 1500 miles or so, but on a few mornings the red light would stay on
for much too long, say 5 or 10 minutes before she go out. This prompted me to
check my terminal connections etc., arriving at the whoknows theory that maybe
the gypsyrigged D+ wire took awhile to start work charging the battery (insert
a dead battery ep here) and perhaps some morning soon the generator would call
in sick and the light would stay on, so I called in sick instead and switched
it to another generator out of the pile and then but my light was flickering
for a bit and troubling me I replaced the brushes and it bit the big one when
the bottom spring crumbled from rustiness and I had to pull the motor to put a
new one in, but got it together with fresh brushes and that didn't work, so I
got a paint stick and some sandpaper and got the motor running and stuck the
stick right onto the commutator and it polished up nice. This caused my
flickering light to go out, but....on the testride to rhode island the belt
broke after only 20 minutes of traffic so I pulled over and replaced it but
the new belts from the store seemed about 5 millimeters too big so lo and
behold I've possibly got a 60s SP Gen on my  73ish dp bug motor in the bus. So
where does that leave me? Perhaps I need to change to a later generator or use
more washers I'm not sure,  but I still hear a suspicious sound and feel that
the generator is just probably beat, so I've gathered a couple of good
prospects and will change the generator back to one from a dual port housing.
anyone who has been through the early late gen belt game if there is one - I'd
love to hear from you.
