Hello,
    
     First off, thanks for helping me out with my  question about the
side mirrors.  I finally got one of them off!  One more to go!  Now a
new problem... I'm trying to install a new windshield and was wondering
if I need to use any type of adhesive or not.  I got some instructions
from type2_dot_com but nothing was said about adhesive.  I'm playing hooky,
err, I mean I'm home sick from work today in order to complete this
project, as the sunny days are few and far between right now.  Much
thanks.
