To the self righteous.

I have a '65 Sundial and couldn't be happier.  I bought it in &quot;nearly new&quot;
condition from the 2nd owner.  My wife and I have toured the Rockies, the
Sierras, the Canyons, and the Columbia river gorge - never a problem - Would
like to reconfigure the &quot;icebox fridge&quot; to 12v but other than that - no
issues.  Admittedly, I don't really know the difference between a Westy and
the others but am anxious to learn.  

However, I have to put in my kudos for the Sundial - and a reminder note to
those within the V-Bus community that must &quot;cast stones at my favorite
American bastard&quot; -  it reminds me of the church going &quot;Christian&quot; that
points a finger at the long haired hippy guy in the back row (usually me),
elbows his/her self righteous pew mate and says, &quot;What's he doing here.&quot;  

In the V-Bus community - we are in it together.  If you like your V-bus -
there should be no confusion.  It is still a Vintage bus.

Chuck,
    I am already in for well over 9k in my '66 sundial custom resto.  I like
Sundial's, American made, maybe not the same quality as an older westy but a
darn good camper.  BTW, if your buying a 66 it will more likely be a Kombi
rather than a panel conversion.

&gt;I have a chance to pic up a 66 Sundial, and at risk of a flame war, can
&gt;anyone give me the pros &amp; cons of a Sundial vs a Westy. By that I mean is
&gt;the quality of the camp gear as good as a westy, do they hold their value,
&gt;that sort of thing. I know some of them were built on panel buses and this
&gt;one appears to be also, any pros or cons?
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Chuck
&gt;Van Is.
