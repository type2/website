&gt; My high mileage '67's front suspension almost sits on the stops.  I was
&gt; sure that there must have been missing or broken torsion leaves to cause
&gt; this problem and I was surprised when I pulled the whole thing apart and
&gt; found everything was there and nothing was broke.  I turned the leaves
&gt; around and installed them upside down thinking that if they torqued in
&gt; the opposite direction that this might help.  It made no difference.   I
&gt; use coil over front shocks in order to pick up the front end.  The ride
&gt; quality is poor compared to my low mileage '66 westy!

Hi Gary,
Sounds like you got a set of improperly hardened spring leaves, or some Joker 
figured out he could aneal (soften) them and get a lowered ride with less 
risk.  You might just want to invest in a new or proven good used set to get 
it to ride correctly.  Do be carefull with coil over spring shocks.  We have 
seen them tear off the upper rear mounts on due to being too stiff!  Eric&amp;
