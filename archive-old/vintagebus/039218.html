&gt;OK, I'll bite. I see SCAT advertised in HVWs, check out the webpage still
under construction. RMMW even lists a SCAT crank. I hear about Berg, but
haven't followed up on that yet. What I see from SCAT is a C/W crank with
eight dowels, set up to handle the eight dowel lightweight flywheel. 
Two quesions: Why a lightweight flywheel and what's best source for C/W
crank and balance rods? &lt;

In a bus you will not want a lightened flywheel.  The more reciprocating
mass the better.  You will want an Equalizer rear pulley from Berg also (CB
Performance has a 4.5 lb one but the Berg is 6.5 lbs).  

You can get stock welded C/W cranks with 4 dowel pins... Probably be cheaper
than the SCAT also.  The last C/W crank I bought was about $140 with 4
dowels.

You can get reconditioned rods and balance them yourself it you have time,
patience, and a bench grinder.  Or just get them from a reputable supplier,
they are pretty common parts.

The Gene Berg website is good information to reference also at
www.geneberg_dot_com.

Good Luck!
