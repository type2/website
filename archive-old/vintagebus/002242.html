 to relace the hose, to find it was too
&gt;&gt;long&gt;
&gt;
&gt;You really should replace all of them. Brakes are no place to economize. If
&gt;one is bad, they are probably all bad, and if you don't know when they were
&gt;last replaced they are due now. Hoses have a big effect on the brake
quality
&gt;on buses, one that too many bus drivers have never experienced.

Kyle, -
unfortunately right now i do have to economise if only to sort out the
broken first then later replace the lot.
good advice appriciated tho - thanks.
- can't really say i've had to economise on the buses brakes up to now.....
new front shoes, new rear shoes (ouch!--- rear shoes alone were 47UKpounds)
new cylinders, had the front drums machined. this is just in the last month.
eventually, maybe sometime this year - i can get back to working on my 54.
