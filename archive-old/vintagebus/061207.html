Subject: Driving from Jackson, Wyoming to Victor, Idaho


I just returned from Jackson, Wyoming.  I saw quite a few buses there:  Splittys, Early Bays, a few late Bays, and Vanagons.  I was wondering what it's like to drive the 20 or so miles from Jackson, Wyoming to Victor, Idaho in a Bus.  Seems like it might be a bit of a challenge with the 8000 ft elevation and the 10 percent grade.

Anybody ever done this drive in a Bus?
