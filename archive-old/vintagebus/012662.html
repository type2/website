&gt;From: &quot;Barry Wright / Riktam&quot; &lt;riktam_at_ozemail_dot_com.au&gt;

&gt;
&gt;All,
&gt;Some mechanical mate of mine suggested that it might be possible to
get an
&gt;engineering firm to modify my reduction boxes by milling the case and
&gt;replacing the gears with 2 the same size give a 1:1 redux box W/O
any height
&gt;loss etc. Has this been done? Is there any reason why not? Any info
much
&gt;appreciated.
&gt;    Barry Wright
