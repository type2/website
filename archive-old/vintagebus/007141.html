Subject: Vent Wing Whistling

My vent wings whistle horribly (or is it beautifully!?).  I will make them
stop.  I will develop a nice-looking addition to the existing rubber that
has more plushy flex.  When I do this, and have great success (no
whistley/no leakey), I will pass this info on to you.  Count on it.

Confidence is high.

I have already (carefully) bent the latch plate in....I can press the wing
closed at the bottom as hard as I can, and the whistling doesn't stop until
I move my hand halfway up.

Gene
