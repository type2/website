&gt; Anyway, Steven restored a Mango subhatch Westy that was featured in the Summer 2000 edition of VolksWorld magazine.  I needed to ask him a question regarding his restoration, specifically what he replaced the plastic bronze trim with that bands all of the tables and countertops.  The stuff in his photos looked brand new, and since he refabricated all of the cabinets I can only assume that he refabbed this stuff too.
