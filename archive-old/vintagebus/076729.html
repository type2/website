well not too much drag and not too little, but 
...just right...

I guess it means just barely feeling it, but not hard to turn through.   as if it's too tight you'll wear it out prematurely.  And the click, well thunk whatever.  metal contacting metal.  

My old one made a crunchy thunk.  sounded like a bad bearing.

hope this vagueness  helps

&gt; some drag at the center point. Problem is, it doesn't say how much there
&gt; should be. It also says there should be some _clicking_ when the steering
&gt; wheel is turned back and forth. Mine doesn't click, it's more of a clunk.
&gt; Think that may be like the difference between fweem and 
&gt; fwoom?
