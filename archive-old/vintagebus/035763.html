&lt;&lt; How many versions of the forward shift rod bushing are there?  I know
 the 67 one is different than the badminton type one, but is there a
 different one than that.  I need the one for a 62.  I tried the
 badminton one, but it seemed too big for the bracket.  I couldn't push
 it through.  Did I get a poorly made one?  Is there a smaller one for
 pre 63 busses?   Also which way does the tapered end face?
  &gt;&gt;
the forward shift bushing was changed in real early 66

how to install- remove the front shift rod from bus  take the bit that the 
bushing goes in as well, that the stick shift in can bolts to.

clean the rod up- rust grit b gone w/sandpaper.  Paint if you feel like it

put the bushing in the hole in the thing the shift rod in cab bolts to.   
have it so the bit for the clip faces the rear of the bus.  grease the insid 
eof the bushing, and slide it forward onto the rod into place.  now slide the 
metal clip over the rod and clip it onto the plastic bushing.

make sure everything is oriented properly and install in bus.  use lots of 
grease wher ethe front bushing will ride.  use grease where the front and 
rear shift rods go together, so future removal will be easier.  Snap-on sells 
a 8mm square headed socket, it is oh so gorgeous.  Tie the screw(s) with wire 
twisted so that they discourage the screw from loosening.  spray it with 
undercoating it you want to get carried away.  over the shift coupling.  Can 
be removed later with carb cleaner and a rag.   helps keep it from rusting 
into one.

badminton sounds like the one for the rear shift rod (takes two)  is your VIN 
before 835xxx?  the rear one changed at that time, as the rear shift rod and 
front shift coupler did.   but the front shift bushing is the same through 
real early 66

hope this helps
