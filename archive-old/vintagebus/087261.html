&gt; The boat you are talking about was sold with the 23 window bus  
&gt; about 15 years ago. Haven't heard about that one since.
&gt; I have owned a bus boat for about 13 years now.
&gt; I have been looking for someone who can help me reproduce them but  
&gt; haven't found anyone yet.
&gt; Is there anyone out there who can help me?

I also saw one at Buses By the Bridge 3-4 years ago, but can't find  
the pic.

Is this yours?
