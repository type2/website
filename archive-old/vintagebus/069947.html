Subject: Mounting trailer hitch

To all,
I have an old trailer hitch, the kind that attaches to the torsion bar tubes 
with u bolts, and to the rear bumper for tongue weight.
I looked in the archives for wisdom on the best way to make the rear bumper 
end of this strong enough for tongue weights, and found no consensus.
Have folks done this in a way they are very happy with and would like to 
share?
Thanks in advance.
I have a BMW Isetta that I want to tow on a moderate weight trailer. BMW 
weighs 800 lb., trailer another 700-800.
