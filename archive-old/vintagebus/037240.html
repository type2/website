&lt;&lt; I recently acquired a '61 flip seat, hatch top Westy and am in the process 
of doing a resto. Problem is I have NO interior pieces for it at all. So if 
anyone has any extra correct interior, SO23?? or knows where I can get some 
please contact me.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Greg,
We are compliling a registery of Flip-set buses and would love more info from 
your bus to add to this.  Also we are trying to find parts and pieces 
(Especially interior parts.) for others in the registry.  We have images of 
the interior and owners manual that we would be happy to share with anyone 
who is interested.  SO-23 is nothing like the SO-34 &amp; 35 Westie interiors.   
Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb
