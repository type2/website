Subject: Re-constructing ID plate from bulkhead?

Hello,

I'm new to this list, purchasing my first bus after a 6 year absense
from the VW world, where I've always owned bugs.

I just purchased a 65 - 13 window, which one of the previous owners
cut out the bulkhead to make the bus a walkthrough. The ID plate (M
plate?) is missing, and I dearly want it back. I'm interested in
re-creating a ID plate, but I'm unsure how to go about this. Can this
even be done? How/where would I go about getting the information found
on the plate?

Other than that, the bus is in GREAT shape, with minimal rust to fix.
Everything is original, and the only other metal cut was to add a
gauge next to the gas gauge in the dash. (I'm thinking about putting
an old bug tach in there...)

I run a couple websites, and I plan on starting up a site to post pics
of my resto progress, and a small blog. I'll keep everyone posted.

Thanks,

Michael (vwdrum)
