&lt;&lt; I noticed(and I am not sure when this began) when driving for a while, on
 the highway mostly, if I  slow down to a stop or basically a stop-when I go
 to get back in gear there is a kind of clunk of the engine engaging-no
 grinding noises or anything. I cant figure out what it is. I believe I am
 shifting in the exact same way as when the engine is cooler.
 
 Any ideas?
  &gt;&gt;
do you feel the same thunk when you take you foot off the gas suddenly after 
being at good rpms?   Just leave it in gear, and gason, gas off, gas on?

This cane be wear at the fulcrim plate axle spade end at the tranny.  jack 
bus back end up, turn the back wheels, do you hear a thunk as you start or 
stop turning?  usually there is a tad of play, but wear happens and you can 
get bad thunks.   Does this seem like where the thunk is coming from?

to fix it you need to pull the RGB/ axle shaft and see if the wear is crown 
gear, FPs or axle spade end, and replace whats bad.
