Subject: cleaning intake manifold
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id LAA54125

what is the best way to clean the inside fo the intake manifold, or does it
matter...should I just leave it as is...basically there is some carbon build
up(black stuff) on the inside of it, and I will be reusing it on my new motor,
i wasn't sure if i there was some way to clean that out?
