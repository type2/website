Subject: Unlowering a '61

I've posted a few previous queations regarding this and have appreciated
everyone's help.  Upon the advice of many I have located a '68 front end in
real good shape, everything there except the brakes, so I'm going to go that
route and eliminate the king and link pins.  The rear is complicated and I
have had it checked out at a local reputable shop.  The tranny is a swing
axle Type I, the spring plates have been modified as well.  To get back to
regulation height I have been advised to go back to the reduction gear boxes
and a freeway flyer tranny, to give me some decent speed.

Here's my question:  Since I'm going full 1968 up front, could I install a
regular '68 rear suspension and transmission that would get me back to
normal height and thus avoid the reduction gear boxes?  Would that work on a
1961 panelvan?  Thanks again for all your help.  Don.
