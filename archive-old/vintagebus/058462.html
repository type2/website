Subject: RE: [VB] Paint Cracks

Unfortunately its another PO problem.  It looks as though they used a filler
to smooth some metal panels which inturn cracked, cracking the paint as
well.

Not if you want it to look good. Also, I've never seen a new paint job crack
due to inadequate drying. What products were you using and how were they
applied? Some manufacturers warranty their products if correctly applied.

&gt; Is there any amount of buffing, waxing, or any other treatment that will
&gt; cover up cracks in the paint, probably due to inadequate drying between
&gt; painting?
