Subject: RE: [VB] Laminated diagram

&gt;From: &quot;Michael Knight&quot; &lt;vwdormer_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

&gt;James did you just print it out at home or take it on disc?

Printed it at home.

How much
&gt;did this set you back?

Cost about 4 bucks, laminated.  Chose the 12 X 15 size because it would 
still easily fit on the back of the kick panel.  Doing the text portion 
separately so I won't have to keep flipping it 90 degrees every couple of 
seconds, about 4&quot;X8&quot;.  Was thinking of blowing up the fuse panel and the 
turnsignal switch  sections and putting them on the back.
It's make me a little less apprehensive about the neurosurgury.
