Anyone have any tips on excessive freeplay in the steering wheel?
There is so much slack when I turn the wheel, that steering has become
more like &quot;tacking&quot; as in a sailboat.
Does this indicate problems in the steering box? Or, would the culprit
be tie-rod ends?

it could be anywhere in the steering assembly, even a combination especially
if there is a lot of play.

well, take a look.

 lie under the front of the bus (splash pan off) and have a helper wiggle the
steering wheel gently in the loose area. Llook for loose ends of the tie rods
and drag link, up and down play in the center pivot means the swing
lever/bushings need replacement.     The arm out of the steering gear box
should rotate, but not move in and out and it should not thunk.   Now jack
the front of the bus up on the torsion bar and check for play in the spindles
(read the idiot book, it even has a diagram or two I believe)   that could be
link pins, king pins and/or loose bearings.

switching drag link  and tie rods is easiest and cheapest, so if there is a
combo, do any of that that is bad ASAP, and then check schedule and finances
re whatever else is bad if it is.

While it is off the ground grease the suspension, including the spindles (4
grease points each side plus dont forget the swing lever grease point and 63
and earlier drag link/tie rods have grease points too).   I now think this
should be done every 3K miles, as grease is cheap and replacing suspension
parts is more work time and money especially spindles.    At least rebuildt
spindles are available, and also link pins even steering gear boxes.  For the
time being, that is.

  Grease it till fresh grease comes out.

do take care of it, and your bus will be pleasanter to drive and safer as
well.
