this must be the problem, it is a brazilian case, so im guessing that it is
from the later years of the bug dual port type,

when i installed it i used the orange seals on the adapter and green seals
from the adapter to the cooler, and it worked fine for 7000 miles, not a
drip,
yesterday i tried the green , orange and black ones in the adapter and they
all seemed to slide a bit,
are the green ones only for block to adapter?

&gt; This depends entirely on which years of parts you are putting together. If
&gt; your oil holes are different size (as in early small passage case to the
&gt; larger passages of the cooler adaptor), you need the reducing seals, which
&gt; are green. They are not included in an engine seal kit. They look like the
&gt; large diameter thinner red ones in the kit, but they are different
diameters
&gt; on each side. Ordinarily it would go large size on the adaptor, small side
&gt; on the engine. The seal you put in, did it have movement on one side or
the
&gt; other? If so, it is wrong. It should slip easily but snugly into the holes
&gt; on the block with no forcing, and it should not slide around when held up
to
&gt; the holes on the adaptor. They should not be tight to get in either side,
as
&gt; when you tighten it down you will close off the passages and blow
something
&gt; up, be it cooler or seals. This is the most common error when dealing with
&gt; doghouse coolers, pardon if it is not the case.
