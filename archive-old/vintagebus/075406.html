Billy,

Check out this page at longenterprises_dot_com, my favorite tranny man:

Yes, you disassemble the RGBs first, and when the upper main axle is
released from the upper bearing, etc, then the rest of the assembly will
pull off of the axle. You use two circlip pliers to remove and install the
required circlips. The larger one is a Proto #394, the smaller one can be
bought at most good hardware stores - get an american made one,
SearsCraftsman or better, as any cheapo tools will break, and you'll end
up buying the good ones anyway.

The axle tube is pressed into the RGB, and you undo the nuts at the side
cover on the center section.

&gt; I believe you have to work from the RGB's to get the axles off the trans case, correct?  I'm using Mike Gensler's write up in the type2 library as my main reference for lack of a Bentley as of yet.
&gt;
&gt; RGB's are split, is it the upper-outer bearing that is removed? I tood a circlip off of a bearing and I believe that was the one.
&gt;
&gt; I hear these bearings are expensive and mine look brand new, so I don't want to destroy them. I bought a 3 arm puller that I will probably have to grind down to fit between the bearing and gear behind it. Is there any better/easier way to do this job?
