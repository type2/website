Subject: Rear Hatch Glass

The rear hatch glass on our '67 is scratched and I would like to replace
it. Does anyone know if replacement glass is available that is tinted in
the glass - dark privacy tint?  I'm not wild about the tint films which
get nicked around hatches. I think the stock glass is tempered.  Can
this piece be replaced with a laminated glass?  I can't think of any
reason why laminated could not be used. The original glass could be used
as a template for a custom cut laminated glass, since tempered can't be
cut after tempering.  My Ford van uses laminated in the side windows,
but tempered in any glass that is moved - front, side &amp; rear doors.
Except my other van with a slider door uses laminated. I've also seen
tempered in the side windows, too. I suspect tempered glass might be
cheaper to use and mold.
