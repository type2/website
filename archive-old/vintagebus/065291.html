Subject: Re: [VB] Spongebob bus source?

Lucy, 'splain me something.

I have yet to figure out the appeal of all of these commerical
toy buses.  Every few months, they slap the pop icon du jour on
the same die, and the bus people go crazy.  I bet if they made a
Tampax bus these guys would be lining up on ebay to buy them. Why?

I could get excited about a *new* toy bus, one from a different
die, maybe with better detail, or a different model (crew cab!).  
But how many iterations of the same thing does one need?  From 
discussion I've had with people, it's almost as if they're *compelled* 
to buy them out of blind (or is it blonde?) obedience.  

Sorry, but my shelves can only support so many poorly detailed lumps
of pot metal.

When the first iteration of this matchbox bus came out, it would
have been cool to add it to the collection.  But I'm not going to 
open the wallet for every mindlessly co-branded version.

Look up the Dilbert 'collectable plate' story line some time for 
a humorous take on the subject.
