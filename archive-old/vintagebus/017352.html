what exactly is the problem with the solenoid...trouble starting? have you
installed one of those hot start realys? do you notice trouble tarting after
driveing for a while...
I had the problem after being on the road fora  while, inability ot restart
the engine without crawlign under the bu and shorting the solenoid... I put a
new solenoid in(which seemed to solve the probelm, but it came back as ssonas
i tried a long raod trip. Then I installed on of theose realys, and have never
had a aproblem since.

I've had solenoid trouble before and got a used starter with solenoid on it
from a dude I know. I only used the solenoid and put it on my old starter and
replaced the battery cable. Things have been fine for a year but then it acted
up again, so I performed the John Muir tapping method with great success.
BUT....... where can I, if anywhere, can I get a new solenoid without another
starter attached to it? It's a 12v starter in my '65 Microbus with a 1600 dp.
Thanks people,

Jim J.
