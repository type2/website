&lt;&lt; My question is what should I do first? I know I need to fix the Fred

Hi Rob,
Always start by completely going though the steering, front suspension, 
brakes, inspect tires, and check rear axle to make sure that the 
tranny/reduction boxes are full of new oil, and the reduction axles are 
tight, or they need new bearings.  If you do not go through these thoughly 
before driving it then you can expect to find yourself sooner, or later, 
wrapped around a tree, crashed in a ditch, or imbedded into the vehicle that 
was in front of you.  Then work on the engine, sealing the body to keep out 
water, and keeping down the rust.    Eric&amp;Barb
