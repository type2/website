Subject: Fuel pump question

  I installed a Brosol &quot;alternator style&quot; mechanical 
fuel pump this weekend and can't figure out wich outlet 
is &quot;from tank&quot; and which is &quot;to carb&quot;. I checked the 
archive and idiot book w/ no luck.
  Old pump was in at the bottom out at top. This new one 
says opposite on box I think (its in spanish). They look 
the same, shouldn't they both work the same? I tried 
running it both ways with no luck. 
  Maybe it needed to be primed first? and how do i tell 
how long the rod should be? My VW guy said the one I had 
was too long but I don't know if this short style is too 
short and causeing the problem (how do I tell, can i 
turn the motor over by hand and measure how much it 
sticks up?)

Thanks!
