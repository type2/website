Subject: Re: [VB] Thanks for all the imput ..

Seems like it could be tranny mounts.  The 67 has no engine mounts  Does the 
stick shift in the cab jump when you hear the thunk?   One test is go to the 
back, and pull towards you hard on the top of the fan shroud.  If the motor 
tilts back, and if it is bolted to the trannys, odds are the tranny mounts are 
bad.  you could lie under the front of the tranny and have you son pull the 
shroud as you watch.  If the tranny lfts up in front, you should find a cracked 
mount up there.   It's a rectangular rubber thingy under the nosecone.  they do 
go bad every so often, and it is not their fault that it went bad.  The parts 
are cheap.  but.........

Your mechanic should be able to recognise these symtoms.  Fixing (replacing 
tranny mounts)does require pulling the motor.  driving with a bad tranny mount 
will mess up your shift rods and cause damage, as well as being a pita to 
drive, so do get it fixed.   It would feel kinda like teh clutch cable is loose, 
when the tranny rears up.

which they should do free of charge anyway as a cracked case means the case 
is bad, you said it is newly rebuildt, this has a warranty you said.  There is 
some more labour for pulling the tranny back enough to replace the front 
mount.  Tell them you need a different case as that one is bad.  Do not accept a 
weld up.  It does happen, but usually to cases that run hot, and have been bored 
for oversize pistons and cylinders.   It is not common.   It has never 
happened to me.  It is bad.   The case is damaged. toast. dead. kaput.  (well IMHO)  
cracked cases mean oil leaks out the case.

&lt;&lt; 2)  As for the Clunk:  I only hear it when releasing the clutch and 
stepping
 on the gas.  I can make it so you can't hear it at all if I release slowly
 enough to piss off the people behind me.  I hear it just about the time that
 the clutch is fully released.  I hear it in all gears I think ..
