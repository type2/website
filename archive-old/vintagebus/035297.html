One of the things I did when I had Misato's engine out recently was to fix
the heat.  The old HEs were so rusted I could move the outsides of them a
*lot* over the cores.  I secured a set of good used ones, installed
them...and now I have good clean heat from them.  It's too bad none of it
makes it to the cab :-)

The heat exchangers are pumping plenty o' heat into the tubes, but it
mysteriously vanishes/stops right around the bench seat divider.  The tube
is warm all the way up to that point.  FYI, it is straight where I am
thinking, goes through a frame piece and starts bending upwards.  The pipe
seems to be warm at the beginning of that (bending upwards), but it is not
at the end where it goes through the next one.  I have *nothing* at the
vents up front.  She's a kombi so no outlets in the rear.

Any suggestions on where to go from here?  Is the whole thing welded
together?  Is all hope for a warm winter lost???

check for rust holes, and air blowing out somewhere.    Also, perhaps there 
is a clog in the system, particularly if the heat has been used for sometime. 
  It is not uncommon.     if you dont find a rust hole, remove a heater 
connector tube in the rear to a heater box, and try compressed air to blow 
the clog out.  perhaps blowing it backwards could work better?
