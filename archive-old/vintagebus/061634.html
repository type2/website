&gt; Do you have the rubber gasket between the handle ends and the door?

Yep, the gasket is in place.  Something I could try, though, now that 
you mention it, would be to add some thickness to it, like cut a 
piece of rubber out of an old inner tube.  Or, a couple of pieces. 
That may be enough to counteract the fact that some of the metal 
parts inside are worn or whatever.

thanks,
