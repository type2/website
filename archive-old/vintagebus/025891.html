&gt; A lot of magazines (and not just VW rags) depend upon low- and un-paid
&gt; reporting from their readerships.  If you want to see an event covered
&gt; in a magazine, send them a story and photos and you have a fair chance
&gt; of getting some press.
&gt;

what if the bikini rags got flooded with event and tech stuff on busses?
would the bus content go up?
has there been or will there ever be a type 2 magazine?
even quarterly on news print...
