YOu can remove them with minimal, if any, damage by reaching thru
the front of the drumto the edge of the seal with a piece of wood,
and gently encouraging the stick with a hammer.  I like the early
style seals too, but they're NLA.  To re-install, use a flat piece
of wood across the seal and tap it back in.

&gt; Rebuilding the brake system on my 62 DC, and have a question.  This bus
&gt; still has the original (I think) bearings and seals in the front drums.
&gt; The seals are all metal.  I've only ever seen the silicone ones that are
&gt; fairly easy to remove.  These metal ones are a bit#h to get out.
&gt; Anybody have a good tip to remove them.  I'd like to save the inner
&gt; bearings and don't want to destroy them by pounding them out from the
&gt; other side.
