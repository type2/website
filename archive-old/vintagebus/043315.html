Subject: Buying a split
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.3.96.981028164711.4173A-100000_at_students.si.fct.unl.pt&gt;

Hello volks.

  My name is Eduardo and I am a portuguese fan of the Type 2 VW.
I've recently started some negotiations with the purpose of buying a '64
split, in good original condition, with a mere 50,000 miles from new.
  I'd appreciate it if you could give some advice as to what I should
check before bringing it home, as I intend to drive it from the seller's
place, over 200 miles from my town. Also, any other advice about what I
should look out for when inspecting the bus would be most welcome, since I
am a novice when it comes to VeeDubs (but I do have lots of mechanical
knowledge).

  Thank you very much for your attention.

	Eduardo Relvas
