The chormy liike palstic I was refering to is a match to the silvery grab
bar, you are correct. To call it 'chrome' at all was proabbly misleading of
me. Mine are ok, but if new ones were around, I'd probably be in line.
Haven't got to pay much attention to the interior stuff yet, too busy
staring at floorboards right now...:(

I've never seen this.  Pics would be helpful.  The grab bar end-thingys on
all of the later middle seats in factory brochures and promotional lit. were
color keyed to the &quot;silver-beige&quot; grab bar.  They tend to dissolve and
crumble over time.

&gt; My 66 has a 2/3 middle seat, and yes, the ends of the grab bar are a
chromy
&gt; like plastic. I will take pics if any one needs them for info. This bus is
a
&gt; non walkthrough, and the mount plates use the slip in bolts to mount, wish
I
&gt; had all of them, but that's for later! :) The legs aren't drilled for the
&gt; new style hold down, so that should be 67 spme time, yes.
&gt; There is no kick panel on mine, didn't know if it was supposed to have one
&gt; or not though.

&gt; Hi Dan!
&gt; Full width middle seats were factory installed in some walk-throughs in
'66
&gt; and '67.  I don't know of an &quot;M-Code&quot; for this, but it was done.  I also
&gt; don't know if this was ever done on earlier buses...I've never seen one.
&gt; And, yes, late '66-'67 full-width AND 2/3 seats were different from
earlier
&gt; ones.  The full-width seat had the outer (right side) leg canted outward
and
&gt; the fold down part of the seat back was twisted inward slightly to allow
&gt; easier access to the rear seat.  The 2/3 seat had NO outer leg and NO
&gt; infamous clip-on &quot;kick panel&quot;.  The first legs (from right to left) were
&gt; offset several inches inward to the left under the seat...don't know why.
&gt; This 2/3 seat is very rarely seen.  And , as already mentioned, at some
&gt; point (late '67?) the lower frames on these seats were factory drilled
with
&gt; holes for the new type hold down clamps that supposedly kept the seats
from
&gt; slipping in a crash.  Also, NONE of these later seats had chrome ends or
&gt; metal grab handles as alluded  to in an earlier post.  They were all
&gt; equipped with vinyl grab bars and bio-degradable plastic end caps that I
&gt; wish someone would reproduce!!
