Subject: RE: [T2] Stuck rings

Another thing that the Corvair folks
http://www.corvaircenter_dot_com/forum/index.html do is pour a chemical
manufactured by Berryman's http://www.berrymanproducts_dot_com/. I think its
Berryman's B-12. I think they pour it directly into the cylinders to unstick
rings. Pour it in, let it sit, blow it out, and crank it up. 

You should change the oil afterwards. I'm sure that these solvents will thin
the oil.

You can do one of two things, and hope for the best----to lossen up the
rings--

Pull the plugs, and load up the cylinder's with Marvel, or the best bet
in this situation would be to load up the holes with Kroil--
Put the plugs back in , and let the stuff soak for 4---5 days.

Pull the plugs back out turn the engine over to blow out the oil--put em
back in and start it----

I know guy's that have loosen up frozen piston's with this
stuff----engine's that have been sitting for year's and a good Kroil
soking will free them up---
