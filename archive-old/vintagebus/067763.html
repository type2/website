Subject: Re: [VB] Cleaning solvent question.

I don't really worry about the front end getting clean.   But if stuff is 
caked on I'll knock/pry it off with a wooden stick.   Are you using a 
pressure washer?   Superclean is good too, made by castrol.  Let it soak in a 
while, then go to the self serve car washer and used their pressure washer.

&lt;&lt; What do folks like to use when cleaning off the really icky thick caked on
 grease soaked stuff that resides on front ends and transmission houseings?
 I have tried the simple green crystal industrial and that is almost useless.
 Are the limonene mixtures any good? Or should I go back to old petroleum
 standby's. Kerosene, laquer thinner, paint thnner etc.
