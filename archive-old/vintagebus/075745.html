Subject: Re: [VB] firewall grommets

The original grommets were rubber (neoprene?). They dry up and get cut
thru by the tin, then the tin cuts thru the metal fuel line. Take a 2 inch
piece of VW webbed rubber fuel line, cut it length wise, slip it over the
metal line down into the hole in the tin, and be done with it. It works
forever, no more tin cutting the fuel line.

Personally, I took my line from the tank over to the left of the engine,
ran it thru, and can now disconnect it conveniently for engine pulls,
without getting under the bus, and getting gas dripped into my eyes, etc,
blah blah blah.

Your call, but everyone should check their fuel line situation and ensure
they are not setting themselves up for a bus fire.
