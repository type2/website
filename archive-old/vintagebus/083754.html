I concur with the choice of Ronnie at Type 2 Parts to help with your
new transmission. I found his insight to be very helpful, he took the
time on the phone to determine my driving habits, then he choose the
gearing for me. He then directed Rancho Transmissions to build the unit
and made sure it was right before it was shipped to me. I've been very
pleased with this transmission. So pleased that when it came time to
replace my stock engine I had Ronnie build one of his 1800cc strokers
for me. I have no hesitation in recommending Ronnie to you. I am sure
there are other transmission experts and engine builders out there, but
Ronnie is a bushead of the highest order and you will be happy with
what you get.
