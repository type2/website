Subject: Sunroof part for 66 Micro De Luxe

Hi all,

I need a piece of track from the passenger-side sunroof slider
track--the small 5&quot; track piece that sits behind the longer
track piece.  The '66 I am restoring is missing this piece, and if you do 
not have it, I would be greatful if you could point me in the direction of 
someone who does or might.  I have tried all of the major VW junkyards to no 
avail.

Thanks for your time.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Richard
