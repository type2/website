A PO installed a bay tank in my '63 Doublecab, which is in it's own compartment btw. Hooking the overflow/vent tube to the solid filler drain is a good idea. Cut out a 3&quot; section, put in a T with fuel line. Maybe one of those icemaker water line taps? 
Wish my DC had a vent! There is no drain hole from the filler as on Karl's '67 standard, the filler bulkhead is open on the sides. Is this a year or model feature?

The hose on may by tank is attached high to make it only a vent. I need to fixt that, run the hose out of the compartment somehow and seal the panels behind the seat better than the stock felt gaskets. Gas vapors if the tank is filled to the top of the neck! Clashes with the patchouli oil up front. 

Latest HotVWTrends... Somebody made Dave Heard mad so he tells everybody to not trust the internet for technical information. No specifics, I'd like to see the pre-edited columns. To save you some time, the top half of the column says that busses are more popular now than they used to be. Nice mild-custom Hawaiian DC pics, another Kubelwagen clone on the market.
