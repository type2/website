&gt;&gt;Had a Pertronix go out a couple of months after I installed it.  It 
didn't
&gt;&gt;go totally out, but would cut out.  I have another Pertronix running a
&gt;&gt;couple of years later in a different car.
&gt;&gt;The advice of carrying points/or spare distributor is good.  Or maybe 
a
&gt;&gt;spare pertronix.
&gt;

Hi, ya know this isn't about vintage VW stuff, but to add to the fray: I 
use a pertronix. It has been installed on 3 busses, and has clocked many 
miles. I bought it in 1992 or so and have been using it every since. The 
local VW Mobile mechanic reports the same, bought it early on, has many 
miles on it as well. The downside is that my local VW shop that is worth 
anything says the quality has gone down. I have seen ads from pertronix 
saying they are changing to something better, and maybe they are, but 
the latest news is that pertronix isn't what they used to be.
Too bad, buyer beware. I love mine, and the &quot;investment&quot; has paid off. 
Figuring that I haven't bought points or condensors for 6 years, it has 
paid for itself Add to that my time and it is a real bargain. I hope the 
new models are worthwhile.
Jason S.
