I am running P205/75/R15  Michelin LTX  M/S  on my 63 big nut Micro
Standard. They fit well and look &quot;natural&quot;. The ride and handling are
terrific. I did have to order them however , as it seems not to be a very
popular size in light truck. I would recommend these to anyone where price
is not the number one issue.
