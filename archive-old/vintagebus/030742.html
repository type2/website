&gt; &quot;well, heres how i see it. personally i am not comfortable giving someone
&gt; advice about a fix unless i am SURE i know what im talking about OR i can
&gt; speak from personal experience, like if something has worked for me. but
&gt; their seems to be four kinds of people on this list...&quot; Bob Margiotti

Bob Margiotti helped me greatly by sending me mixing codes for PPG in order to get Palm Green and Sand Green for my Double Cab. That is if I ever get around to painting it. I am kind of the same way. I would like to help
more but I am not a very good facts and figures guy. I try to preface anything I am not sure about with &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;as far as I know&quot; but a lot of information falls into this category for me and with so many very
knowledgeable listies it seems that some of these &quot;I thinks&quot; or &quot;as far as I knows&quot; can be a waste of time. I really enjoy all of the different viewpoints and use my delete key generously when I don't. I am going to
really make a push to get down to the OCTO/Classic weekend this year and it would be good to get to meet some of you from all over.
