Subject: more on mirrors...
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Well, this is interesting..My bus is practically all original, and the 
mirrors are as well (the round style). So,  weren't the elephant ears an 
option in 67' as well? Someone stated that my bus shound have the elephant 
style. I am somewhat confused. ??

        Best wishes,
