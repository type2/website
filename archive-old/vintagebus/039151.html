Excuse me, is there a list I could go to out there and just read about fixing buses? Is there a newsgroup called alt.vws.buses.bashbob or something?

Isn't there a charter or something that says &quot;talk about buses...&quot;

I have my strong opinions regarding this thread, but I'm biting my tongue because it has nothing to do with buses. I'm trying to live by the rules because they are a sanity filter for the list. They keep the list from imploding, which is what it is now trying to do.

Thanks! Joe
