Subject: Two sides to a coin... (was Stripped buses)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Sellers stripping all of goodies out of a vehicle goes
two ways. There is a slight chance that I have
advertised an old bus for sale lately with all of the
goodies included. I have been approached in some cases
and offered on other cases to sell the extras
separately.
Selling this bus at a lower price without all of the
&quot;goodies&quot; is one option that I have taken to help
market the thing.
So step up if you want all of it or double check and
make all of your inquiries with the seller of your
next bus and clarify the deal *prior* to making the
deal. After that then it's a separate issue.
If a vehicle is sold with extra items that arent there
upon delivery or receipt of vehicle then that is
called fraud. Get your deal in writing and be
satisfied with what you buy~ then get over it.
