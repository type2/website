Subject: Re: [VB] just wondering...(a bit long again)

I wish it was... neat.  I suspect you can't get your buses history from the 
WA DOL, but that could be completely wrong.   

Could ask at the DOL and see what they say.

North Dakota. In the article he mentions that he was able to get a complete
title history on his bus from the North Dakota DMV.
Wow, thats kinda neat I thought. I'd love to be able to get that sort of
history on mine. Past owners, where it lived before,
and all that jazz. Does any one know if you can do that here in Washington
state. If so how is it done?
