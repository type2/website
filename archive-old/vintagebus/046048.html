Subject: Re: [VB] 1500 Tin on 40 HP???

Hi John,
You will have to use 40 HP tin and muffler on that engine.  you could mount a 
later fan shroud, even a doghouse one if the motor is a fresh air unit.  
Otherwise you will have to find a fresh air set of tin to do this dog house 
conversion.  You can use the later FW on it though.  Eric&amp;Barb
