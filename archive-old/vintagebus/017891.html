Subject: What's in your package tray?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I figure this is a good Friday topic to follow last
Friday's &quot;what's in your garage?&quot;

Guess I'm responsible, so I'll start.


What's on my package tray? 
2 spiders.
a hearty layer of dust.
About half the dash wiring for the bus
the tube for the passenger side washer squirter.
eighteen cents.
a roll of electrical tape
and....
a Bentley manual.

Can you gues that ol' DARTHVW has yet to darken
asphalt? Very soon, folks. Very soon.

Jason
67 deluxe sunroof with a LOOSE steering wheel and a
black cab interior (except where the rock band
stickers were when they painted it) and no washer
bottle, but with two NEW padal pads.
