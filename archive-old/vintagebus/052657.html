Subject: Re: [VB] Sheet metal cutting

&gt; Sheet metal cutters... anyone used the nibbler from Harbor Fright?  What
is
&gt; the gauge of bus metal?

I took a piece of a rear quarter panel (louver replacement time :) to a
local sheet metal shop and they said it was 18 gauge, so I bought a 4'X10'
sheet of the stuff. I think there are some smaller gauge panels on the bus,
but for the most part, it's prolly 18 gauge.
