OK, Ya got me stumped on yer thinkin here. Identical stroke and bore with more
air and fuel equals less torque? Couldn't prove that to me and my 67 SC. I
pulled the new SP out because I needed the pulling power with a load up the
hills. And with the larger oil cooler and wider fan, cooling shouldn't ever be
a problem in normal applications.

Hi John,
SP will deliever more torque, while DP will result in more HP at much higher
RPMs.  For a bus the SP and its resulting increased torque over DP is
absolutely needed.  At least this seems to be the rule of thumb for engines
up to at least 1776cc size.  For even more torque go with more stroke of the
crankshaft and less bore.
