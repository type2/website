&gt;    It idles fine.  When warmed up, it revs from idle fine.  BUT, . . . If
&gt;I'm just cruising down the road at a constant speed, it coughs and seems to
&gt;loose some power (not much, just a little so that I notice it).  If I stab
&gt;at the gas, it accelerates fine.  It does the same thing when in neutral.

&gt;Off idle it sputters and even sometimes gets a backfire out the carbs
&gt;(usually the right carb) if the throttle is held in a constant off idle
&gt;position.
&gt;    These ICTs are currently installed on a 1776cc engine with 009 dist., a
&gt;mild cam &amp; mildly P&amp;P dp heads w/ stock valves.

 Hi, Nate:
Spray carb cleaner at the throttle butterfly shafts outside the carb(s)
and see if there are leaks which temporarily seal and the idle speed rises.
Try replacing the 009 with a vacuum advance distributor.
check the timing advance, too much will cause backfire out the intake,
and possibly a mismatched curve will cause the problem at one point
and not at another.any wobble in the timing mark indicates wear.
it also helps to have the air cleaners installed- something about the &quot;fog&quot;
or fuel mist above the carburetor having an effect on performance.
Carbon build-up in the cylinders can hang up valves and cause backfire.
