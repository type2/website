When in K-mart about 2 months ago, I saw a PC racing game that featured VW
busses as the vehicle of choice. I was poor that day so did not buy it. Now
I want one. Anybody know where to get one? I have been back to the store
several times to no avail. I have tried searches on some game sites and come
up empty.
