&gt; I just finished installing all of the components on a new stock 1600
and had

not
&gt; getting a charge when I check the side that the condenser is hooked
up to.
&gt; Charge on the hot side is fine.  I think the coil may be bunk.  Any
comments
&gt; or suggestions are appreciated.  Thanks.

Get another coil.  Having a spare around is a Good Thing(tm) anyway,
(which I learned the hard way).

Sounds like you have an open circuit inside the primary of the coil.

&quot;New&quot; doesn't always mean &quot;good&quot;!
