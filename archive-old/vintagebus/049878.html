Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

&gt;Hi:
&gt;When I adjusted the timing today I found that the original timing is 30-40
&gt;degrees BTDC. That's terrible.  I've put about 1500 miles on the engine with
&gt;the wrong timing.  Can anybody tell me how much and what kind of the damage
&gt;would my engine have suffered(it runs well now)?

Don't sweat it.


  Also when I backup my bus,
&gt;depress the clutch pedal but remain the shift in reverse gear, I can hear a
&gt;weird noise from the rear(I never notice that before).  Can anybody tell me
&gt;what's wrong with my tranny?


As the dealers love to say (while you're still under warranty):  &quot;They all
do that.  It's within normal manufacturing tolerances.&quot;

Seriously, I've herad that noise before.  I never thought anything of it.
