A quick answer is:
It depends on how long you want the bus to last.

The longer answer is:
Putting anything in there that CAN absorb
moisture WILL absorb moisture.  This WILL lead
to rusting from the inside out.  Check the 
archives for potential answers to this dilema.  
Simply putting something in there that won't 
absorb isn't enough either.  The differential of
temperatures of insulated and uninsulated
areas WILL lead to inside condensation and to rust.

It is not an easy problem to solve.  At least
in manner that won't cause problems later.

The PO of my bus glued carpet foam type stuff 
to the inside of the outer metal, in a haphazard 
manner, leaving lots of place for condensation,
left off the plastic that protects the door 
side of the interior panels from rain coming
though the door off the window.
I found it fully covered with mold.  This is
in sunny dry, hot California.  This was the
only panel I have removed to date.

that's my take on it anyway.  Insulation
will keep it warmer, quieter, etc.  But
there's a drawback, it's what you are willing
to live with short &amp; long term that determine
your approach.

&gt; I'd kinda like to get an idea as to how people feel about insulating 
&gt; a
&gt; bus before putting panels back in - is it worth while? - does it 
&gt; lead to
&gt; more rust? - if it is useful what kinda would be best?
