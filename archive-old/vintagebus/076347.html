Subject: Re: [VB] front seat area? 

it should still be stamped in the body sheet metal by the rear apron on the
right side, if it's not, something is wrong. i have a 64 and a 67 that both
still have the vin there.
i should have clarified, i was asking what the unknown m-code is.


&gt;
&gt; From 63 its on the overhead fresh air box.
&gt; 056 Steering lock
&gt; 119 Eberspacher
&gt; 220 Limited slip diff
&gt; The model number is 2416 the same code as Ben Laurence's double  sliding
door
&gt; deluxe. 241 is deluxe model right hand loading door lefthand  drive.
&gt; David Eccles book says m164 is the M code for deluxe sliding  door. Mike
