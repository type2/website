 I'm looking for some good ideas that are quick, simple, cosmetically
 appealing, and undamanging to the engine tin.  I have the hot air intake,
 heater duct, and heat riser holes that I need to plug in my rear tin.  I'm
 going to attempt to take my newly built 1776 out to Colorado at the end of
 this week in my 67 bus and I'm going to need to be able to plug these holes
 in a way that won't damage my powdercoated tin.  I was thinking along the
 lines of some kind of sandwiching clamp of some sort.  Anyone have any good
 ideas for me?  Thanks for the help!
  &gt;&gt;
washers each side and a nut and bolt?   generator shims are useful.  spray 
with black paint.  not terribly noticable for the big round holes.   or black 
the bits first and use rubber grommets to protect your tin
