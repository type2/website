Subject: 58 singlecab F/S LHC area

Went and looked at the 58 singlecab Sun morning with Matt. Talked to the guy
who has it for sale. Belongs to his son who lives in LA. Has been sitting
since 99 and was only started once in a while to take wood from storage to
house fireplace since, real short distance. Motor is rebuilt 1500 (by Marty
Litner) and later r/b trans was installed. Real nice interior, radio plate,
all grey panels. Only rust was a 2 &quot; spot on top rear of both doglegs,
treasure chest and bed nice, missing t/c lock assy, very good front floors,
has had front skin replaced and small dent on lower nose, bondo and dents on
roof, some tailgate hinges cracked and 2 welded up, slash front bumper, no
rear, head and tail lights good, trucker style mirrors on outside, never an
inside mirror or pass visor, black front seat, cut wheelwells,baja bug style
wheels and tires ( 15&quot; ) look fairly new, nice louvers and rockers, small
dents on rear below taillights, crank rr apron cut for exhaust, no other
crank stuff, 12 volt, horn worked, don't know about wipers. Matt made an
offer for it and we are waiting an answer back today. I made Matt a backup
offer also. Will see what happens.
