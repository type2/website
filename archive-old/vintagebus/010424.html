Here's my ex-'54 Single Cab:

M 10, 18, 20, 70, 83, 86, 90, 103 &gt;&gt;

Have you figured out if any of these options listed on your birth
certificates are barndoor only, or do they all work out to be the same as
post barndoor M-codes?
&gt;

They all appear to be normal M-codes, nothing Barndoor-specific.  18, 83,
and 86 are unidentified but I suspect they are either US options or normal
stuff, both of the vehicles are from the same dealership in CA.  Perhaps
sealed-beam headlights is one of those codes?

M103 is heavy-duty shock absorbers, I believe this only applied to the rear
as the fronts on the Truck were the originals and appeared normal.  The
rears were missing but I have seen heavy-duty lever shocks so I assume that
is what was on there.  These would be Barndoor-only as they are lever-style
shocks.  That doesn't necessarily mean it's a Barndoor-specific M-code.
