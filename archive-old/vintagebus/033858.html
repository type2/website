Just for future reference, how much are a set of original VW safari's in
decent shape going for nowadays?

You have a few different options:

Stock: good luck finding a pair, and bring your wallet ('cause they don't
take american expresss...)

Bus Boys/Wolfgang safaris: frankly, they suck.  Both the design, appearance
and build quality put Monica to shame.And don't get me started on customer
service.

Izzy's safaris: much closer to stock, at least in appearance.  

Creative Engineering: I've heard they are very nice, but I've never
seen them in person.  He also does barndoor safaris.

I decided I want a set for the '55.  I'm getting a set of Izzy's, but I'm
having the frames  powder coated in dove blue, then assembled as normal.
