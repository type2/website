Usually shops tend to overtighten drain plugs!  They don't want to take
a chance on them coming loose!  If they manage to strip the drainplug
while overtightening it, they will then turn it backwards to the point
of maximum tightness.

&gt; fix 
&gt; things (and charge me).  usually I get it right.

Good point.  Everybody should do their own fluid changes, just to be
sure that the proper fluid goes into the hole.
