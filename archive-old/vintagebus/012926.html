Hey Steve,
Thank you and eveyone else, for that matter for shedding some light on the
whole soto/octo situation.I have owned newer buses up until the last year or
so and wasn't in on the whole &quot;vintage bus club&quot; scene.
I didn't realize that there was such a rivalry.
As someone said,VW trends does seem to paint a pretty picture of soto
whenever they feature a story about them.

Just to let everyone know, Hot VW's June issue has a 2 page spread about
octo's winter meet and they go on to talk about the show at &quot;the pond&quot; on
Sat.June.12th.
Just because I'm driving down all the way from Vancouver, I think I'll check
out all three shows that weekend...after all I still have a passion for VW's
not matter what club is sponsoring an event!
See you in June!
Andy
