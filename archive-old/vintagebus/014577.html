Hope you didn't go and buy this months VW trends because I don't think he's in
this month's...but as I was flipping through some OLD Trends....I found this
kid in the back off the magazine..and his name is Thom Fitzpatrick...think
I've heard it some place before....and after looking at the kid sitting on
this &quot;bug&quot; it sure does look like the Thom I met once. Anyways he's in the
&quot;Pile of the Month&quot; section of August of 87 VW Trends on page 91...to give you
a summery of the artice here are a few quotes!

&quot;vintage 1969 piece of dirt&quot;
&quot;detailed in early American mud&quot;
&quot;front end lowered by adding three dead goats&quot; explains why we don't discuss
lowering
&quot;drivers seat turned into a recliner&quot;

Give me a week or so and I'll get the article scanned...it has a great pic of
Thom sitting on the roof!!!
