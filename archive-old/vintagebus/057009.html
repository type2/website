Subject: Re: [VB] Tranny Oil Update spec update GL5 -MT1?

Has anyone tried redline MT90?  It is supposed to be
safe for copper and brass to 350 F.

&gt; This sounds like the same stuff that you can get at
&gt; the Audi/VW dealership.  
&gt; It is the only gearoil that is used in the Quattro
&gt; all wheel drive systems.
&gt; 
&gt; The stuff that the dealer has is full synthetic and
&gt; was approved by VW for 
&gt; use in all the vehicles they have ever produced.  It
&gt; is made by Kendall or 
&gt; Mobil, I forgot.  But it is GL4 and GL5.  The
&gt; downside is that it is 
&gt; expensive, $25US per US gallon.  The  parts guy gave
&gt; me an extra gallon for 
&gt; free though. You will have to bring your own
&gt; container because they get it 
&gt; by the barrel.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck

&gt; &gt;Apparently there is 'new' spec for GL5 which is
&gt; GL5-MT1.
&gt; &gt;It is apparently safe for brass and
&gt; &gt;bronze gearbox components and won't corrode them
&gt; (developed for]
&gt; &gt;this reason).  Here in Oz Penrite have released a
&gt; hypoid
&gt; &gt;GL5-MT1 in a 80w90.  According to Penrite
&gt; &gt;it  is completetly safe to use and back of
&gt; &gt;container explicitly states 'completetly safe for
&gt; brass and bronze gearbox
&gt; &gt;components'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm still hunting for some tech info on the spec as
&gt; opposed
&gt; &gt;to the manufacturers assurance.
