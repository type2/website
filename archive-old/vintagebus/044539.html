   I remember seeing a procedure for aligning a vehicle but since I had 
always relied on shops I blew by it.  Doesn't Eastwood offer a home setup 
also?  So can you accurately align a Type 2 at home without special tools or 
is this &quot;process&quot; an interim solution til you can get to a wheel shop? &gt;&gt;

Hi Volks,
You can align a link and king pin front end fairly easily.  The only part the 
average home mechanic can not do is to check the front trailing arms for 
being bent unless you have the special VW tool.  So if you get new shims for 
the link pins since you old ones are probably worn out and do the job 
correctly you can just road test it.  If you thereafter have a problem with 
the steering one can always go to the alignment shop!  We have done several 
type 1s &amp; 2s without any problems.  The three VWs we have put the most miles 
on so far have after 30-40,000 miles on a set of tires never had any wierd 
tire wear or steering problems.  So we never have had to go to the alignment 
shop!
