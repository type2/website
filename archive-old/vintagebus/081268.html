Subject: Re: [VB] got a throttle return spring??

. one is too tight, the others are too
&gt; loose. my bus is idling way too high and i cant get it to settle down. if 
&gt; i pull on the spring the idle will go down.

I had the same problem with the spring for my dual kads. What I did was take 
a loose spring and take a few wraps of the spring off and twist the last 
ring 90 deg to replace the end I cut off. That way I fine tuned the stretch 
and pressure from the spring. It worked very well.
