hey all, I thought I would share this.
Yesterday I pulled in to my local dealership with my 65 singlecab. I =
parked up front where everyone could see me, breaking the monotony of an =
endless sea of shiny new cars. The young &quot;professional&quot; looking couple =
that was standing in front of the parking space took one glance at the =
truck and with a look of confusion and disgust on their faces headed for =
the security of the showroom. As I started inside the salesman next to =
me points at the truck and says&quot; you know they are coming out with those =
again in a few years&quot; This time to look of disgust and confusion was on =
my face. &quot;yea I know&quot; I replied, &quot;but they aint gonna be like that, and =
I wouldn't trade in that&quot;, pointing at my truck&quot; ,for one of the new =
ones&quot;.=20

later
