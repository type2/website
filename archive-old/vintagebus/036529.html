be careful when mig welding, you get a harder weld and more heat
then tig. use .023 wire and the lowest heat range you can.
i use a commercial mig (hobart) that has a 100 percent duty cycle
at the low heat ranges, the thing to look for in a welder is it's
duty cycle, some of the cheaper welders will only have a 20 per cent
duty cycle at any heat range which will cause inconsitant welds if
used for long periods of time.  in the pictures i will be posting
soon it shows how we welded in wheel arches (with tig) hammer
welding as we went ( metal shrinks and expands) finishing off the
welds, shrinking and strecthing the metal to make an unnoticable
panel replacement. this and other metal tips will be up on my new web
page by the ytk.

&lt;&lt; What type welder should I get (100-200 price range, less would be
better) 
if I
 were to get one and from where?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
Get a wire feed welder mig will do, but mig, tig is better so you can
weld 
aluminum.  In the long run you will save time, and money by getting
this.  
Plus in a major brand like Lincoln or Miller parts should be easy to
get.  
Our setup cost us about $700.00 including gas bottle years ago, so
hopefully 
the price has dropped even more.  Eric&amp;Barb
