NatureWell EB again this year was awesome!  Plenty of buses and a great
crowd of people.  It took us 4hrs to get there with the 3 kid's fighting all
the way!  Our youngest got bus sick on the way up from all the swaying as
the 18 wheelers blew past us.  We finally made it and almost couldn't find a
spot!  We couldn't believe how crowded it was.  Met up with a lot of old
friends and met a lot of new ones.  Got some great ideas.  Lucked out and
found a driveaway tent that matched our Heilite camper that we pull with the
bus, very rare find!  Thanks to Chrs &amp; Michele, Mad Dave and everyone else
who made it such a sucess.  I set up some pic's for all to see.
