Subject: redux box to spring plate seal

Hi folks,

I searched the archives on this, and couldn't find the answer. Is there a
seal that goes between the reduction boxes and the spring plates? After
replacing my tranny some time ago, I've got a leak there on the left side.
The right side holds fluid just fine. If there is no seal, should I use some
kind of sealant? It looks like I can jack up the left side, unbolt the redux
box from the spring plate (maybe remove the wheel first), pry the spring
plate back a bit, and squeeze some sealant in there. Would this be possible?

Thanks,
