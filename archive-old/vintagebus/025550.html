Subject: 67 master cyl prob solved!
Message-ID: &lt;376C9ACB.C3A297EE_at_bitstream_dot_net&gt;

I had written earlier re: my weak front brakes on the 67 westy. I had
traced the problem
to the front circuit of the MC so I took it out and opened it up to take
a look.
Well, what I found was that the prev. owner had &quot;rebuilt&quot; it, the cups
and seals looked good and the bore was clean, only he had put the front
circuit piston in BACKWARDS!

This had smashed a part of the spring plate, but no other visible
damage. Considering this same cylinder took me, my girlfriend and our
dog 5000 miles from Minneapolis to Jasper BC, Vancouver, Seattle back
home through Yellowstone and the Bighorn mountains with only a minor
complaint about how weak the front brakes seemed is amazing, especially
considering that when bleeding them, I was lucky to geet the tiniest
squirt from the front lines....I'll have to check out those rear pads!

Over and out.... and looking for a rebuild kit and spring plate for a 67
MC

I remain your westy detective - Tim in Minneapolis
