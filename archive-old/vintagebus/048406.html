Hi Steve,
Is the oil only seeping on the inside of the brake backing plates and not 
showing up on the brake drum side??  If so the paper seals are not the 
problem, instead you probably have a set of spacers that ride inside of the 
axle seals that are worn out or too rough due to rust/scrathes.  BTDT!  We 
never use sealant with any of the paper seals in the RGBs except for a light 
finger painting of silicon sealant on the RGB half seals we make out of phone 
book paper.  We sand the sealing surfaces flat (Well flatter by getting rid 
of the really high spots at least.) with sand paper and a piece of auto flat 
glass when we first use/repair parts that use paper seals.
