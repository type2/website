Subject: Re: [VB] Friday question

yes we are &quot;Luddites&quot;-every last one of us.
during the particularly cold times of the year my wife asks me why our only 
mode of transportation is a vw bus that is 35 years old. i give her a 
romantic explanation about being one with the road and not being divorced 
from reality by technology. then she asks me why i don't sell the bus and 
buy a horse and buggy. i don't think a horse and buggy would be as fun as my 
bus though-
besides they don't have lists for them:)!
thomas-
yes! its friday
