 conversion back to 6v.
  with my makita drill to the generator pulley bolt how many RPM would i
 need to check the generator for output.
/////////////////////
good question, bet it says in the bentley  (output 7V at x rpms of 
generator). 
.................
 with the end play and dead cylinder on this thing i can't justify the $$$
 to rebuild annother motor with a fresh 1600 sp in the kombi already
 now i know the 40 hp fan shroud, tin. etc won't fit my 1600 *exactly* but
 has any one tired?
 thus a 1600 with old time feel?
 ..................
the rear tin won't fit, it is too short.  I mean the 40hp is too wide.  well 
at least the 40hprear tin and (muffler) wont fit a 1600.
