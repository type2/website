I will definately consider the Rancho guys. Ronnie has some real decent
prices for 'em and he's not that far away - I could pick it up. If I do,
maybe it would be a good opportunity to spend the extra money on a &quot;freeway
flyer&quot;? But I'm a little worried about that with the reduction boxes still
in...'anyone else think that would be an issue?
