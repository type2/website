Subject: Gettin' some jets...

Well I called Kymco today and talked to Ron.  He asked me what I was running
on my engine and told me what jets to run.  It was cool - I told him I had
the Weber book and was running these figures by him and he knew what I was
talking about.  He asked about the heads/cam/displacement and so $80 later I
have new jets and rebuild kits on the way.

And then I called CB Performance about their modified venturi conversion
kit.  It costs $130 and comes with all the jets.  I asked the gal about the
relation of the jets in the kit vs. the displacement/cam/heads and she just
said that they have this one kit -you put it in and go.  I do at times
question CBP procedures on things because in the past I have not been
impressed (due to other situations that I won't mention).  Anyway, since
I'll be rolling in jets by the end of the week for these 40IDF's - I'll make
sure I post what jets the CB mod kit comes with vs. what Kymco sends me.  By
then, I may have some jets for sale at a reduced price just to get some of
my money back.

I'll keep y'all posted as usual...
