&gt; Where did the Sears allen wrench not fit, Tranny fill plugs or RGBs? Will

Here's how to improve the Sears allen wrench if you can't or don't want
to fool with returning it and finding the good 3/8&quot; drive tool.

Chuck that sucker up in the vice and cut a couple of inches off the long
end with your trusty hacksaw. It may take a while, but when you're done
you'll have a nice 17mm tool that you can stick in your plugs and turn
with a socket, open end or box end wrench. I'm talking about the short
piece. Save the big L shaped piece for when you drop your other piece in
the weeds and can't find it.
