I'm definitely no carb genius, but I have to agree with eric and barb on
this issue.  If a carb has too big of venturi no amount of re-jetting will
correct the problem.  My buddy bought a sandrail with a burned up engine
with dual webbers.  After fighting jetting and other things, he let a carb
guru look at it.  It was discovered that instead of dual webbers, it had 2
single webbers on it.  A single intake was installed and it ran perfectly.
Erin, my type 4 in my old rail had 40's on it and it ran like a striped ass
monkey!  I think I still have the intakes too.  Go with the dual webbers and
save yourself the headache!  If you decide this is what you want to do maybe
we can do a trade for something!

&gt; &gt; Would be interesting to take a look at some 72 type 4 bus stock carbs.
&gt; &gt; Especially the venturi size of them.   We have been wondering about
using
&gt; &gt; early 40 HP carbs.  Since they were engineered for 1200cc two of them
&gt; should
&gt; &gt; work well on a 2000cc engine.  We think the 34 PICT-4 would be too big,
&gt; &gt; unless you are planning on drag race instead of driving long distances.
&gt; &gt; Eric&amp;Barb
&gt;
&gt; Good points all of them.  The 34-pict-3 would need to be rejetted I'm
sure.
&gt; Ronnie mentioned that the 34-pict-3's should mount right on a 72 bus set
of
&gt; manifolds as those were Solex carbs that came factory.  All you would need
&gt; to do is jet them correctly.  Also, I have some 34ICT's that I might try
&gt; using as well.  I just like the idea of chokes as this cold weather makes
it
&gt; very tough to start my Weber 40's in the mornings.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the input!
