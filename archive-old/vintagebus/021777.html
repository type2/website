&lt;&lt; Where do you guys usually get your tools?  I need to buy a 215ft-lbs 
torque 
 wrench, 46mm socket and a floor jack(what lift capacity do I need for engine 
 and tranny removal?).  Any online source? &gt;&gt;

For hand tools I usually end up at Sears going for the Craftsman stuff.  I 
think they are great tools at good prices.  Perhaps not &quot;The best&quot; quality 
available but they don't cost an arm and a leg either.  I think for the 
hobbyist they work just great.  And their lifetime guarantee doesn't involve 
waiting for a truck to come around once a week.

I got a great 3 ton floor Jack at Sam's wholesale club
