I still like the hydraulic wheel bearing grease and drift way to get these
bushings out. I have found it much faster and less distressing to the bell
housing. Just my opinion and your mileage may vary.

&gt; Hey
&gt; Yes you might break it, and no you cant just leave it. If you leave that
big
&gt; of a starter bushing in there, the starter will be binding and prolly not
&gt; even turn over the engine cause it will slip. Thats the point of the
bushing
&gt; (besides guiding it), is to support the starter. Plus it will start
&gt; oblonging the bushing until the point that it digs into your tranny
housing
&gt; which then yer super screwed and replacing the bushing wont even help. You
&gt; dont have much choice if you wanna run 6v now, just be easy tapping it
out.
&gt; -Wade
&gt; Wonder if somehow you could switch the front body section of a 12v self
&gt; supporter and a 6v, then cut the end of the 6v starter shaft off and never
&gt; have to worry about bushings again.....

&gt; &gt;Thanks to all that replied to my first questions. I have one
&gt; more...Sorry..
&gt; &gt;Please see pics at:
&gt; &gt;http://www.geocities_dot_com/my65kombi/photo.htm When I try to drive the old
&gt; &gt;bushing out, do I run the chance of breaking the area that holds the
&gt; &gt;bushing??? The walls were shaved quite thin.
&gt; &gt;I couldn.t just leave it alone, could I? I assume the bushing should be
&gt; &gt;fairly snug around the starter shaft?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks Again,
&gt; &gt;Michael Moore
