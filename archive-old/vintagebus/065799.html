Subject: Re: [VB] More Electrical Problems

I've got color printouts I use of the diagrams on Thom's site. Been using 
them all along, they're great. Everything looks like it is hooked up as it 
should be...only thing I'm not sure of is the dimmer switch. It's an 
aftermarket switch w/3 prongs and no labels on the terminals. 

Could all this be caused by my hosing down the cab floor? Some light spray 
may have gotten on wires/fuses/relay. They are bone dry now, and no sign of 
anything, but I thought I'd ask.
