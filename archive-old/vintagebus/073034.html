Subject: Re: [VB] RE: The Empi Truck

Sometimes I wonder how Everett does it myself, as there are plenty worse kind's of folks on there beside just &quot;gold-diggers&quot;. If you visit certain parts of the message boards you'll know of who(m) I speak. It's still my favorite site regardless. 
 
I would like to see the truck redone to it's former glory, it was pretty cool.
