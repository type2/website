Hi all,
  I finally got around to replacing my steering box and thankfully I can say 
it was a good experience.  I appreciate the input I got from the list 
previously.  What took the most time, was pulling the steering wheel.  I 
rented a nice 2/3 arm puller from Autozone when I found that here in Dallas, 
they have free tool rental.  After a couple of tries, I gave up since I was 
paranoid about hurting the wheel and couldn't seem to fabricate anything 
that I read about in the archives.  What finally did work, was spraying 
wd-40 down the hole and banging on a 2x4 from below the steering wheel base 
while pushing up with my legs.  I did this for about 3 minutes and 
eventually it popped up.  Its incredible what is available in the archives 
and I really appreciate the people responsible for it.  I was really glad to 
see type2_dot_com back up.
  So now, instead of around 10&quot; of play I only have about 3&quot;.  I'm pretty 
sure I can make up some of that, since the draglink ends have a little play 
in them.  I should have changed that out first probably, but I had the box 
and figured it would be a good learning experience regardless.
  At the bottom of the steering column on the floorboard I have nothing (I 
can see light from underneath). Shouldn't there be some type of collar or 
something?
  Thanks again.
