Subject: Re: [VB] How much oil?

&gt; Should I put the oil in the lines before attaching the hoses?  Or should I
&gt; measure how much oil the hoses hold, and add that much to the 3.5 quarts
in
&gt; the engine?  Maybe I'm paranoid, but I want to do it right :-)

The engine holds 2.5 quarts. I wouldn't try to fill the hoses or the filter.
Put everything together, put 3 quarts in the engine, disconnect the coil
wire to the distributor and crank it for awhile to fill everything up. Check
the dipstick and add enough oil to bring the level to the mark. Reconnect
the coil wire and start the engine. Let it run for a minute, then turn it
off and check the dipstick. Add oil if necessary. Make a mental note of how
much oil it took to fill the system.
