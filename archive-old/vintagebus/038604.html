Buslife is still around and still dead.
http://www.egroups_dot_com/group/bus-life
If people really do want a buschat list, just make one at egroups or i will,
or revive buslife.  I also wrote a list archiver several months ago that
would be excellent for a web interface for it.  Very featured compared to
the web interfaces of other lists, including this one.  Im a senior app
designer for a web company would gladly host a site for it as well.  you can
see my current failure at http://vw.illequipped_dot_com

There WAS an offshoot from this list called &quot;Buslife&quot;, which concerned
itself with bus topics non-technical. I watched it for a couple of
weeks, and it wasn't very active... Is it still around? URL?
