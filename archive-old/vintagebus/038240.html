Hi all,
This is my third day driving my newly acquired 1966 velvet green panel van.
I finally drove it to my house this Sunday from where it was being garaged.
It took about three hours to get home cause the carb was all gummed up from
sitting and it was lacking an air filter and preheat hose, not to mention it
was about 39 degrees outside too. Total max speed 50 mph. Got to know its
little quirks pretty good. But I was tired by the time I got home, I'm just
not used to driving busses since the westy has been without tranny for six
months. My Beetle requires no upper arm strength to steer and the clutch is
lighter. 
 
Well the accelerator cable was broken it three places and patched with
bailing wire, a whole lot of bailing wire. It will get a new cable this
weekend. Luckily all of the brake components are new, but the system needs
to be bleed and adjusted. Pedal goes to the floor but is real firm. Clutch
need to be adjusted also, kind of drags while in neutral with the clutch
out.
 
To my surprise it is allot quieter than my Westfalia. The cab divider cuts
the sound down tremendously. It even stays quite warm in the cab, even
without the heaterboxes hooked up. The panel will definitely need a front
sway bar like in the Westy. It really sucks having to take simple corners at
10-15 mph. I am also amazed at the visibility I have. Even without the side
windows I can see all sides of the panel through the oversized rectangular
mirrors. These aren't VW mirrors but they have the same style arm, probably
aftermarket mirrors. They are really crusty. One even broke off as I was
adjusting it; good thing I had some electrical tape handy.
 
Speaking of electricals, it was converted to 12 volt by my friend Zach way
before he sold it to me. I will probably need to change the wiper motor. It
goes way too fast and it makes a screech sound when it is first switched on.
The motor is real loud, I can barely hear my self. Luckily I've got  a
12volt motor in my stash for replacement. I think some of the wiring is
messed up. The high beams don't work when I flick the lever, they just turn
off completely, and the left side tail light goes dead when I put on the
brakes, and the turn signal light in the speedo only flashes some of the
time. Electricals are always little annoying things.
 
The body panels are straight as an arrow. All of the rocker rust was
replaced with new metal. The welds still need to be taken down more and skim
coated but there is absolutely NO buckling of the original panels. The
repairs are top notch! One of our best body guys up here in Washington did
all the work. (John Kelly, you might have heard of him or probably not) The
price of the bus reflects the quality of the body work.$$$ The nose is a
little munched, but can be easily smoothed out with hammer and dolly work.
It looks like the bus ran into a small deer. the only damage is right below
the emblem and right above the overrider tube. pretty easy to access that
area using spoons and stuff.
 
Well, who says you can't buy a used car from a friend.
I know my friend Zach is loosing some money in the deal but he was more
concerned with this panel having a good home.
In the spring I'll fix the nose and put on a new layer of Velvet green
paint, plus deck it out in my company's graphics.
 
Hope I didn't ramble on too much.
