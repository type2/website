Subject: 65 noises

my 65 deluxe has been leaking tranny fluid (more like streaming) for a long
time.  I was filling it daily to drive her.  (which wasn't very often) Just
didn't have the time or knowledge to fix her myself.  I finally bit the
bullet and took her in the shop.  They put in new gaskets, cleaned off years
of tranny fluid leakage, brakes, new fuel lines, and many other things.  I
told them if it looked like it needed it go ahead while it was apart.
Other than the leak and a wobbly shifter she actually shifted and drove like
a dream.  Very quiet.

Well that was a month ago and she has been running strong on her all
original engine and tranny (78,000 orginal miles)  She is 99% original and
stock.

Till Thursday.  I was accelerating into 3rd and as soon as I shifted it
sounded like I missed gears and was in neutral ( hi revving) but I was
aceelerating so I know I was in gear.  It did this as I shifted into 4th
also.  Once I get to speed and stop accellerating the sound lessens or
stops.

Friday the 13th I wake up and drive her to work as usual (daily driver is
getting an engine transplant) She isn't making the noise so I think all is
well.  Then POP!!  What was that I thought.  Then the gen light comes on so
I pull over immediately.  Of course it was dark as I drive into work at
around 6:30 am. So I found my spare belt and swapped it out on the side of
the interstate.  Start her up and merge back on.  Sound is back???  And now
it is getting worse.

What should I be looking for?  Tranny problem? Reduction boxes? Governor?

Any help would be appreciated.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
