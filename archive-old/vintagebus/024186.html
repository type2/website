Subject: Jerome report (not to long)

It was great to meet Clara, Matt &amp; Katie (email address and I will
send that picture, its cute), and other listes. Kyle and Joe are crazy
and great guys and have to have super wives to put up with them, which
they do. What can be said about the raffle camper but it was outasight!
As john said, not perfect, but super. One ?, why do Hot VW,S and VW
Trends still not show up to Jerome? What does it take guys???????
Free rooms, booze, broads, air tickets, what? Only my opinion. 
Jerome was good this year but i agree with Kattie on most points.
More rainbows than vw lovers, more drum circles than swappers,more
load music and obnoxious people them past years, more each year it
seems. What to do before next year, maybe im dreaming, but give me 
back the 1st couple simple Jeromes. These are only my opinions so
yell at me if you want, but I think something needs to be gone.
John Howard
