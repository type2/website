[...] Big Snip
&gt;If you want to be clever, you can buy a 6 V gel cell battery and wire it
&gt;in series with your Bus.

[...]

&gt;  The 6 V from the battery gets added to the 6 V from the
&gt;battery/generator and you've got 12 V.
&gt;
&gt;The super extra sneaky hidden bonus part of this is that when you're not
&gt;actively charging the cell phone, you can rewire the 6 V battery so it
&gt;is charged by your Bus!  Just connect the battery negative to the Bus
&gt;body and the battery positive to a hot-all-the-time wire in the Bus.
&gt;Even if you're not driving, your starting battery will charge up the gel
&gt;cell without too much loss of capacity.
&gt;
&gt;You can install a DPDT switch to automate this process, if you like.


I just got back from a day of having fun running my student's underwater 
robot around in the aquarium and was at first tempted to answer this 
post.  After reading through all the replies, Matt's answer is hand's down 
the best yet and by far the simplest and most elegant.

Touche Matt.
