&lt;&lt; Is there an advantage or disadvantage to using the big nut RGBs over the 
small nut variety?&gt;&gt;
Hi S,
The standard Non-mountainous ones have a larger upper gear and smaller lower 
gear that the standard pre-mid 64 ones.

&lt;&lt;Intuitively I would expect them to be stronger?  True?  False?  Other 
points? &gt;&gt;
The 63 only one ton suspension had the same diameter splined shaft on the 
lower axle and used the same 36mm socketed nut as the 55-early 63 bus 
suspension and the 1938-79 type 1.  The late 64 thru 67 lower axles are much 
bigger diameter splines, use a 46mm socketed axle nuts and with the bigger, 
better and longer lasting outer lower roller bearing.  
   So why did VW make a one ton suspension package for one year and then 
redesign it for the next year?  Most likely for more strength/reliability!  
VW did this several times were they introduced a new bigger stronger part or 
component on a small quantity of thier automobiles.  If it survived several 
years the improvment was introduced to other ACVW automobiles and if not was 
redesigned or completely dropped.
