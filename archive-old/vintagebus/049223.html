It's a white/blue 23 window on the road to Salt Lake City for an overpriced geek-fest. Nice big shot of the van, later tail lights, big aftermarket round STOP light above the T-handle, arc shaped oil cooler on roof? Trim removed. Ugly bumper/tow hitch, extractor exhaust, hacked apron. 

Go to your network geek's cube and ask to see their latest Brainshare literature. Has bumper stickers, &quot;My kid developed an intranet for your honor student&quot;, etc.  I'll try to get a copy uploaded to our favorite servers.

IT... Didn't Werner Eberspracher sell that in the '70's?
