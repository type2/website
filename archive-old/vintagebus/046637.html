Subject: Actual Height Change Per Spline? (REAR)
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Need to adjust the rear end on the 67 due to the rear wheels being tucked 
under pretty badly and bad tyre wear.  All I need to know was if anyone has a 
manual that states the specific changes in height per each spline, inside and 
outside.  I had a manual which stated this but have long since lost it among 
all the parts and jusnk in the garage.

I know that the outside should have more splines than the inside thus giving 
the inside what like 1.7&quot; and the outside is what like 1.4&quot;??  I don't really 
know.
