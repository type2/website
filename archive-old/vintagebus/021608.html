&lt;&lt; What's left of the engine (which still turns by hand)
 and the transaxle is still there.  Are there any parts that I should try and
 get that are hard to find for the old buses? &gt;&gt;
Hi Victor,
You really should get the front and rear suspension out of it for you truck 
now or in the future.  20% bigger brakes less reductions gearing and parts 
that will be easliy availible at part stores!  While removing the front 
suspension the front shift rod is a good item for many fellow bus owners out 
there.   Eric&amp;Barb
