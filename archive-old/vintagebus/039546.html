It had been 5 weeks since I put the Tinkertoy in the barn to 'rest' while I 
commuted from Charleston to Lenoir on the weekends.  Every weekend I'd 
tackle projects around the farm that I should have a week to do.  I'd walk 
through the barn, looking at the Tinkertoy and wishing I had the time...

It's been kinda chilly in the foothills, the breezy Baywindow doing the 
grunt work of hauling me back and forth to work and between chukkytown and 
the farm.  Visions of the Tinkertoy sitting in the barn waiting, solar panel 
trickling the battery, if I had the time to go for a relaxed chuffle...

Saturday night it was all of 18 degrees.  Tellwiddit.  Check the tires, 
oil's good, turn the key, Click.

Nothing.

{insert unkind word here}

Sure is dark in the barn with no lights.  No lights.  Hmmmm.  Sure as a 
sliding baywindow door leaks, clean battery connection, no click, starter 
whirls and engine catches right away.  Ahhhhhhhh.  Stutter and dies.  Oh 
yeah, choke was left on summer setting, tickle the gas and do the manual 
quick idle.   Ahhhhhh

Ease outta the barn into low moonlight in the orchard, around the barn to 
the house, leave her idling a bit to let parts get reaquainted in the 
presence of oil, let things warm up.  Let the family know I'll be gone for a 
while, going to town for no better reason than the long way there.

Onto the road, easing up past 2nd up the hill in 3rd, keep an even 3000 rpm 
to let the gear and red gear boxes warm up.  Fast moving little car gets 
huffy behind the old slow bus but that's their problem, plenty of passing 
opportunities in a little while.  Until then, enjoy the view duuude.

Over the hill, can feel the bus relaxing as everything warms up.  Much 
quieter than the the Express.  Sealed much better too.  No breeze with 
windows closed.  Uninsulated heat channels are doing a good job of moving 
the heat to the front of the bus.  Wonder how good it would be if I 
insulated them, doesn't matter this feels really good.  Driving a splitty is 
almost effortless after 5 weeks of heavy baywindow camper life.  Cruising 
along the back road, no particular place to go, Mr Berry jammin' good in the 
stereo, must be a coincidence, though I don't believe in them.

Into town, stop at the gas station to top off the fuel and no better reason 
than say Hi to the nice young lady that works there who asked me once why i 
drive that old bus, not having met the OLD bus.  She's not there, that's ok 
because that's not really why I'm out tonight.

Cruise back outta town after meeting with some friends, life is good, I'm 
driving the Tinkertoy and it's even warm in here.  Take the other back way 
home, over the mountain, down the other side, the farm comes into sight.  
Around the barn, back in, just for fun look and there's less than 1/2 inch 
difference in my tire tracks leaving and returning.

Disconnect the battery, hook the solar panel back up, walk to the house - 
slowly.  Think of the other just to go nowhere rides, other days, and the 
sheer delight of driving a vehicle that's a pleasure to drive.  That's why I 
keep her going no matter what it takes.  Not because it has any significance 
to anyone, not because it's stylish, or fast, or trendy, but because it just 
goes so nicely.  I was only 8 when she was built, but that doesn't matter.  
Age is irrelevant.  It's how you feel that's important, whether your 
considering yourself, your soulmate, or your bus.

Walk back into the house, see the family hanging out, hugs all around just 
because I feel good and I don't get to spend enough time with them.

What other reason do I need?

Mad Uncle Dave
