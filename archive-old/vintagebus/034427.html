There might be some more archetypes; You forgot the people want to keep the 
buses alive because buses are happiest when they' re moving. Sometimes that 
necessitates rescuing them from yards. Setting them free. Buses are reliable 
and easily and cheaply fixable. Buses need to be driven and don't need to be 
altered much from stock, just driven alot. some hippy some dippy - all 
recognize the benefit of simplicity. There are sometimes hippy buses without 
bumper stickers. Alot of times its better to be covered in grease when you 
get pulled over.
