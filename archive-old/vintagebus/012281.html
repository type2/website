Hi Volks,

I have been collecting pieces of a Westy interior.  I have the jump seat,
fridge and z-bed.  I need a closet.  Originally I was going to put this
into Sparky, my '60 panel, but I might save another splitty from you know
what.  i know of a '67 west that is guttied and needs some TLC that I may
put the interior in.  If anyone knows of a decent closet, please let me
know.  Thanks

Joy thru air,

Jamie
