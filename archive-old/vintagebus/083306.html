Subject: VW want to remove entusiast site

 Hy type 2 friends.

 Recently here im Brazil, the VW decide to use the power of a big 
corporation
 (as it is here) and remove the site www.kombi_dot_com.br from been published
 from his owner, one type2 entusiast. The VW want just to redirect the 
adress
 to his comercial site www.vw_dot_com.br . As we know, the comercial site does
 not have the type 2  story or any information available to entusiasts.
 Looks like they dont care to the past, only care to sale sale sale...

 The reason i was wrighting is to ask you Type 2 lovers, &quot;to post a coment 
in
 the site,&quot; just to show there are people who cares for the past, the
 history, the information, the friendship aroud these world of old volks.
 Also to encourage the site owner to keep fighting for what he believes.

 The site is about one and a half year, and he is just trying to do somthing
 nice, slowly but nice. He have no sponsors or donations from no one. Is all
 made with his own money and has no comercial aproach as you can see.

 I just start to colaborate with him and i will keep doing what i can.

 Thank you very much for ho read these and lets keep the Split Bus alive all
 aroud the world.
