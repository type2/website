Subject: paint

yesterday, I painted the nose of my bus. I used a bright white enamel. I 
had tried painting with a two part acid etching urethane and had expected 
to use the urethane paint over the primer. But the two part primer gave 
me a real fit. In my opinion, it is best left to more experianced 
painters. On top of that, it is very toxic. And when I got some on my 
hands and fingernails, I could not scrub it off!!!  Very nasty stuff. 
Worked real well as primer though. . .sanded real smooth. But I am going 
to look for an enamel primer that is easier to use.

The bus looks so much nicer now. Can't wait to get to the rest. The 
enamel was fairly easy to spray and it matches up real nice to a white 
enamel in a spray can available from Kmart for $1 a can. This makes touch 
up real easy. I have decided to go this route for now, until I get all 
the body work completely done, and then I will either respray the way I 
want, or I may just opt to keep the beautiful white.
