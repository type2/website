Subject: RE: [VB] New Double Cab/Tow Truck Horror Story

 When ever I get a bus towed I insist on a flatbed only! I have and will
never alow a bus to be towed by a hook or wheel lift. You do have the option
and need to insist on it. Even in our middle of nowhere city, most tow
companies have at least 1 flatbed.

Subject: [VB] New Double Cab/Tow Truck Horror Story


I just bought a '61 double cab this afternoon.  It's was straight, 
mostly-rust-free, with the only major flaw being a cut out bench 
(why the h*ll do they do that?) but it came with a replacement 
section and seats, I just have to weld it in.    Oh, and it's been
lowered (why the h*ll do they do that) and has some cheesy centerline
wheels on it.  But almost all of the body work was *done*, and it's
half-painted.  It would be a weekend paint job, it was so straight.  
Oh, and incorrect taillights, and I think  incorrect rear wheel wells...

I paid more than I thought I wanted to, but I've wanted a double cab 
for a while, soo...

I talked AAA into towing it home.  It took about an hour and a half
for the truck to get there.  I was going to pull it with the bus,
but it is missing a bunch of lug nuts because some yahoo didn't bother
to put them all on (why the h*ll do they do that?).  The tow truck
was following me home, and all was well and good until I noticed he wasn't
there any more.  I slowed way down and waited.  Nothing.  I pulled over
and waited.  Nothing.  Tom (Mink) made a series of phone calls and
eventually got the driver.  One of the tow straps had broken, and he
had to stop and fix it.  &quot;I may have dented it&quot; he says on the phone.
Like hell!  The DC, which was being pulled backwards and on dollies,
'rear-ended' the tow truck, smashing the rear corners in badly, and even
tweaking the bed downwards slightly.  It even bent the seam forward of
the rear vents.

The wheels are up for sale - make offer, as is the Wolfgang Lowering Kit.  I
suddenly find myself in the market for some stock bus spring plates...

Any ideas how I should proceed with the tow stuck company?  AAA?
