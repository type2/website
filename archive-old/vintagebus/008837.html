Wow. ya know, I really wanted to post that message to the list so another
choice list member could see, but I had too much respect for other listees
and didn't want to waste their time. Too late for that huh? My apologies to
the list for getting into it with someone too immature to leave it at
p-mail. (he was never in the service....conincidence????)
bus content-I will never sell this guy a bus part.
more bus content-I have found a DD Panel for sale for $1200 that I have to
pass on. P-mail for info.
More bus content-Still looking for a 21/23 window

Flame on! I'm prepared with large bad words!
Tired of playing games,

&gt; &lt;&lt; Alright. Now you listen here bitch. Yes I said bitch. Why because I
have a
&gt; temper. Because I work in thermed forces and have to come home and listen
to
&gt; pukes like you fill my inbox with messages of crap. Lemme tell ya a few
&gt; things. one, you can't call me a &quot;bad businessman&quot;, because I'm not a
&gt; business man. Fuck you. Dont buy anything of mine. I give a damn if anyone
on
&gt; here buys anything off of me. 2.Ya wanna call me a liar, you better come
do
&gt; it to my face. (i'm in GA BTW, be my fuckin guest) You try organizing
1387,
&gt; yes 1387 emails in my inbox right now. Aint gonna happen chief. Aint got
the
&gt; time or patience. Wanna hear something else, if anyone is close to me,
they
&gt; get parts for free. Because I dont have to take my time (which I seem to
have
&gt; virtually none of) to take them off and ship them etc...Is that bad
business
&gt; too? So what if I put them on 2 auction sites. VB auction is for no more
than
&gt; advertisement purposes. I have had numerous auctions on there and not a
&gt; successful sale yet. Why? Because anyone can get an ID. Thousands of
teenage
&gt; punks (probably much like yourself) can just go on their and get an ID and
&gt; fuck with all kinds of auctions. I will never rely on it for any more than
a
&gt; free billboard. Me get a life? Yeah you got me there. Look at the time I'm
&gt; wasting writing you...And a Job? Listen here buddy. Of all things. I am
&gt; proudly serving in the United States army and if you or any other jackass
out
&gt; there who aint got what it takes dont like it, kiss my ass. It should be a
&gt; mandatory thing in this country. It'd be a helluva lot better place.
Sounds
&gt; like maybe you should think about it...
