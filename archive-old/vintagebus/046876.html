yea, for sure.  As my little family and I gathered around the traditional
Thanksgiving pizza, I took a moment to reflect on the true meaning of
Thanksgiving.  Once the moment passed I retired to my lazy-boy to make foul
bodily noises.  After the air cleared I took time to reflect again, I found
that I was very thankful for these Type 2 lists full of wonderful people and
wonderful Volkswagens.  I also found that I was very thankful for not having
to work on the bus today.  It's sits in the driveway somewhat forgotten.
(since I sourced this Thing-the bus has pretty much been idle).  I felt a pang
of guilt and grabbed the keys.  Dodging rain drops and the cold wind.  I set
my butt in that well traveled drivers seat and turned the key.  Vooooooom!!
It sure is nice to know that even though my attentions have strayed. I can
still depend on Albert!
    Peace, Love, and Happy Thanksgiving!
         Mr. Bubble Head
