Subject: Fuel Flow

I have been having some idle problems on my 71 westy, 1600 DP with 34pict3
carb and stock vac dizzy. I have changed to a new carb, new fuel pump, and
ruled out any vac leaks. I put on a new clear fuel filter, and I can see that
the fuel filter is being sucked dry at times.  The fuel line is not clogged, I
confirmed this.  Rather it seems that gas is not being sucked into the carb.
ANy suggestions about what may be going on?

Peace, John Baker
