Subject: Show Report: Larry's Nationals, Xenia OH

Hey everyone.  I wanted to report on a show I went to this past weekend.  I 
loaded up my family and we drove down to Dayton on Sat and stayed at a 
hotel.  Sun morning we headed to Xenia to the track and the show.  We parked 
near the swap and I made my way through.  Didn't see any parts I needed so 
we went on to the show.  I began taking some pics and came upon the split 
bus section of the show, 2 entries and one was what looked like a 60 
sundial.  It had the correct windows and was once a panel, but the interior 
had been hacked up and was incomplete.  The tent looked to be sundial as 
well, but was a solid turquoise and not the usual striped.  Being that this 
is the first possible sundial I've seen since being in the midwest, I 
tracked the owner down and began asking him questions.  Turns out he got the 
bus fom a friend in CA and insisted it was a sundial.  I'll post pics later, 
it was an interesting bus and fit the pre 63 sundial kit.  The other bus was 
your standard lowered green kombi w/ brm's.  There was one additional 
splitty in the for sale area, a kombi with a sign stating they pulled it out 
of texas.  It wasn't nearly as rusty as most of the stuff around here, but 
it did have some and several dents too.  The asking price..... 2800.00, no 
interior either.  After that we hung out and watched the drags, my wife 
really enjoyed them and insisted on staying till it was over.  She said it 
was really neat seeing those slow little cars go that fast. All in all it 
was a nice little show and beat hanging out at home for the weekend.
