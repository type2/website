has anyone out there used this system on a bus, do you need to put a lot o
fpressure on your winshield? are they likely to break?
I have what i believe is the original glass, 35 years old, a lot of
scratches...not too bad while driving during the day, but at night, I get a
lot of scattered light across the glass. If possible to polish the scratches
out that would be great, but i don't want to break the glass.

thanks for any feedback on glass repair
