Subject: AZ- vintage central street cruise tonight!

To all who are interested and live in the general Phoenix area and are into
vintage cars in general, there will be a HUGE vintage cruise/car show thing
up and down central street, and by park central mall in the parking lot,
between 6pm and 10pm approx tonight (Sat apr 13th). It is a multi AZ
vintage car club thing that they all organized to reminisce how it 'used to
be' back in the day. It happens 2 or 3 times a year. I have been to it once
and there were 3 or 4 hundred vintage cars driving up and down central, and
parked in the park central parking lot. I'm sure there will be even more
this time. Feels like a whole vintage car city. There are no prizes or or
classes or anything. Better then a parking lot show since you get to see
everything in action. Pretty cool and even some VW's crusin around. Bring
your VW down
-Wade
