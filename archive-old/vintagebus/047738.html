Good job thom ,,i have one of the cheap slide hammer dent pullers ,,the 
collar the attachments go into is tapped 1/4 thread ,,i insert a bolt into it 
head out then weld a plate on edge ,,or just a bolt or something ,,tack the 
plate or bolt to dent ,,hammer away ,,grind tacks loose with zizz wheel 
,,,necessity is the mother of invention ,,well that and being cheap or just 
plain broke ,,in any case ,,,dents come out bondo or filler is much thinner 
,,i'm happy ,,plus saved 400.00,,gotta luv that ,,,,,
