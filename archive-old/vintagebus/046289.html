&lt;&lt; I was hoping that I could just order a freeway flier from someone who is

simple?&gt;&gt;
Hi JD,
Yes, it is.  If you have the VW bus shop manual follow the instructions, and 
ask questions of the list.  

&lt;&lt;Will it just replace mine or are there lots of modifications involved?  Can 
I just use a freeway flier with my current redux boxes?  My bus is a 60 with, 
i think, the original transaxle.  &gt;&gt;
The only modifications are inside of the tranny case.  You can install any 
reduction boxes on it as long as you use tunnel case upper axles.   Eric&amp;Barb
