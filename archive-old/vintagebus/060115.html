Subject: Was Checking Reduction Box Fluid

HELP!
A couple of you were nice enough (Cal and Steve) to lead me in the direction
of checking my transmission fluid and reduction box fluid level.
I noticed when the bus was on stands, the wheels tilted in.  I didn't think
anything of it.
I just opened the garage, and I have a very large puddle of oil, smack dab
in the meddle, and both wheels are tilted in.  I ran here to the computer as
fast as I could.  Well sorta.
What's up with these wheels?
I am going now to investigate the leak.
