Subject: [VB] 64 &quot;11 window&quot;, 59 &quot;micro&quot; and the junkyard SC...
Message-ID: &lt;382B8CEE.7E41_at_peak_dot_org&gt;

I have been busy on the delete key ( keepin up with three lists) and
notice that the stripped SC in sacramento is making everyone slaivate
over the prospect of driving the shell onto their current
drivetrain...the 59 micro of Moe's is making everyone scoff at the
price, and here comes a 64 11 window (whats that a kombi or a standard?)
in the far east, sposed to run good, for $2000....

I notice however, that the single has no gates or doors. :( and what is
the price? Might still be a few hunnerd, and then a front beam, rear
end, engine, gates and doors,,,,then and only then you start where most
folks start the resto. 

Moe's bus is a 59.  Now everyone except Thom and Mark Lapriore and
Charlie Hammil think that is kinda early. And he is asking $1750, but
maybe he will take $500 when no one jumps at it for the big bucks...

Personally, I think I would take $2k and fly to North Carolina to get
the 11 window. But then I'm not currently in the market....

No real point, except to maybe discuss all three buses at once?
