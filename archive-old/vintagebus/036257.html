&lt;&lt; Another question - what kind of foam is used around a doghouse cooler?
 It looks like open cell foam and hi temp, for sure, but where can you
 get it?&gt;&gt;
 
 Hi Roger &amp; Trudi,
We use closed cell foam tape stripping that is for sealing house doors and is
availible from any hardware store.  It is also usefull for sealing the cooling
tin of the dog house cooler.  We also reccomend trying the doghouse cooling
system that can be installed on single port engines all the way down to the
freshair 40 HP engine that started in DEC 1962.  You need to make sure you
install a 33mm or better yet 35 mm wide fan, 2:1 lower pulley.  Plus a full
filter system, and if you really want to try the type 4 cooler that is 40%
larger than the stock doghouse cooler.  As a engineer you would be wise to
remember that KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid.)principle that will make your VW
more reliable in the long run.    Eric &amp; Barb
