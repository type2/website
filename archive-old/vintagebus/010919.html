&lt;&lt; The reason I'm posting this is that the cooler I opened looked beautiful
 from the outside, but after opening it up I noticed a few of the passages
 plugged on the exit side of the cooler, but none on the inlet side, just
 goes to show that even though you think you have the cooler cleaned it still
 can have blocked passages.
  &gt;&gt;
was this a cooler you had cleaner w/ solvent on the inside. or just looked 
clean on the outside?

Because they get crud in there, as dramatically found in this case,  I highly 
recommend flushing any used cooler before using it, to get rid of crud in 
there, as it can loosen up when warm and oil goes through the cooler, only to 
lodge in inconvient places in your motor.   

just put in a solvent tank and a hose in one side and let it run an hour or 
tow.  If you don'r have a solvent tank I bet many shops will do this for you 
for a couple bucks.
