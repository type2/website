Mr Davis said:
&gt; Anyone have any suggestions on what material to use underneath the gas
tank
 straps on the 4 top corners?  I'm not sure what the original material was,
 it's always too far gone in my buses to tell, looks like a horsehair type
 material or something.  
&gt;
How about the same crap that goes under the battery, that roof tar strip
stuff from Home Depot?  Or maybe some Jute padding?

Side note, I made my Barndoor battery strap out of a later Bus gas tank
strap cut down to size, it looks identical to originals I've seen.
