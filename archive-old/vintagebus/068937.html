Subject: Re: [VB] re: Keeps eating wheel bearings?

&gt; &gt; I'm wondering about the tightening tho.  I tighten it sung, but so that I ca
&gt; &gt; still move the washer with a bit of force.
&gt;
&gt; That does not sound so good.  We put everything together and then spin the
&gt; tire to help seat the bearings and snug the locking nut down till you feel
&gt; the bearings stopping the nut from snugging down anymore.  Then we turn the
&gt; nut back off 1/8 to 1/6 of a turn and lock it there.

This second method doesnt seem any more scientific than the first.
You can hand tighten the nut so that the washer is pretty snug.
Actually I hand tighten until the washer is snug and back off a tad.
I make sure they are not too tight by checking to see if the washer will
slide. Wow really not DM huh?...

I would suspect that all these methods MAY give a reasonable adjustment.

Im planning on some brake work today maybe Ill bring out the dial guage
and see if any of these methods gives the recommended .001-.005&quot; of axial
movement.
