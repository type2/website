well my new engine seems to be running great, long test spin this weekend
finally...but it has started to leak, real small...i was pretty psyched when i
first got it and there was no leak, but it stared leaking less than a week
after i installed it...i think it is the front engine seal.

is this normal on a brand new engine? should i be calling butch (the engine
builder?

thanks for any suggestions on this.......
