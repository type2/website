I couldn't resist.  went to their website, read the disparaging remarks,
and sent them this reply (no, the Tinkertoy really doesn't have 400,000
miles but unless you tell them they won't know!

Just about the time I decide maybe to give you guys another chance you
blow it again.  The VW bus is the all around best vehicles ever made.
Carries many people, carries cargo, is extremely simple to work on, and
was way ahead of it's time.  Chrysler claims to have &quot;invented&quot; the
minivan, the third door pickup truck.  If you paid attention, VW had
been building the original minivan since the late 1940s.  The &quot;third
door pickup&quot; came in the form of the doublecab truck from the early
50s.  Once again you have shown that anyone can get into the car
business and fool someone else and make a living at it.  Oh yeah - my 33
year old VW bus is pushing 400,000 miles on the chassis and I still
drive it every day.
