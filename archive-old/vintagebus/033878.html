Hi Gene,
Best to measure out a stock pump for your year or type of relief valve/s 
engine case.  Make sure to measure not only gear diameter, but length!  A 
must to run an oil pressure gauge there after for at least a while to make 
sure you do not push it over 80 Lbs. when cold.  With 30Wt. in our VW's with 
outside temps in the low 70s and oil temp in the 190F range we get 30-40 Lbs. 
_at_ 2,800-3,000 RPM.  VW states in thier official service manual for 68-78 bus 
in the tolerances, wear limits, and settings- at oil temp of 158F (70C) _at_ 
2,500 RPM = 42 PSI (3 kg/cm to the power of three) for new parts and wear 
amount =28 PSI ( 2 kg/cm to the power of three).      Eric&amp;Barb
