Subject: Re: [VB] Are 67's supposed to have reverse lights??

My 67 Deluxe has the Dual circuit MC but no reverse
lights.

Gene

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Are ALL 67 buses supposed to have reverse lights
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; was it just a factory option?
&gt; &gt; I have recently picked up a bus with no title, VIN
&gt; &gt; numbers tell me it's a 67, but then someone else
&gt; told
&gt; &gt; me that 67's have reverse lights, and this bus has
&gt; none.
