 I do not ever want to hear the phrase &quot;surface rust&quot; again. There is no
 such G*DDAMNED THING as surface rust.
 
 Beat your chests if you like but the coachwork on the later buses is much
 better than this. I love splitties but these doors were tacked together by
 people who either didn't care or didn't have time to care. None of these
 door bits bear any evidence of primer, they have one very thin coat of
 paint shot over bare metal--which might explain the not-surface rust.
 
 My wife drove this bus for the first time two days ago, called it hers, and
 put her Honda up for sale. I call that a victory but still I need to get it
 finished well enough that I can call it hers as well...
  &gt;&gt;
For all the talk about fine German engineering, there is much evidence that
these old buses, and the more so the older you get, have less than the most
impressive workmanship.  Hey, but they are great, and quite sturdy I think so
at least.  Rumour has it they were inexpensive when new, as well.  My advice
is enlist the wife in helping Pandora back to her full glory.  Sounds like she
has good taste  (in addition to having married you)   :)

A few thoughts on splitty cab doors:

if you haven't, take the door mechanisms out, clean them up and grease them
well, and the doors will open and shut more nicely.  When the inner handle is
pulled/button pressed, the latch should spin open (dec 63 and on splitties
style doors mechs).  If the bit doesn't spin- it has some crud.  You can check
this by opening the door.   Press the button and manually put the latch thingy
in the vertical position (as it is when the door is closed) release the
button, then take your hand off the thingy.    Press the button, and it should
pop into a slanty position.   If you can't move the thingy by hand with the
button pressed, you have crud.    I take pride in my door's functionality.
Especially when they have been crudded up and then are cleaned out- there is
such a difference, one I can enjoy  each time I open the door.   They can be a
pain, and it is so nice to press the button/pull the handle and them open
smoothly,and shut ditto.  Then I have to remind people to shut it gently.  

Grease the screws when putting bits back together.  Make sure the door opens
when you pull the handle up, or it can be opened accidently when a knee is
leant on it, causing distress and potential injury.   If it open by pushing
down, flip the front bit of the door mechanism around.  The two screws that
hold the front part in place have ssome room for adjustment, which should be
kept in mind during reinstallation- make sure everything works properly before
going on to further putting bits back together.

Then attach plastic over the inside of the door, tucking the bottom into the
door.   I use duct tape, carefully so it won't show when the panel is put back
on.    This is so  the water that drips through the door won't bounce aginst
the panel, which warps it.  And wet panels tear at the bottom where feet kick
them when people get in or out.  

Warped panels can be flattened by soaking them with a hose and then drying
them on pavement under a board on which you put weights (batteries, pieces of
railroad track, toolboxes, etc).  Any trim would have to be removed before
hand and then replaced.

and they put a square piece of foam with a hole cut in the middle on the mid
sixties buses between the panel and the door where the thingy sticks through
that the handle goes on- this keeps the panel pushed up against the escutchon
around the handle.  Earlier buses used a spring.
