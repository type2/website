You would have two of them.  They're rectangular, clear lenses set into the
body below the normal taillights.  They use the same lenses as the Type 3
and '67 Bug backup lights, which is the same size as the 50-57 bus center
brake light.

If you don't have them, then it's an early '67 which didnt' have 'em yet.

&gt;I have a question regarding the back-up light on my 67 westy.  What is it 
&gt;supposed to look like and exactly where should it be mounted? Anyone with 
&gt;links to a correct picture would be greatly appreciated.
