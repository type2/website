&gt;Take one of the two bolts that holds the whole thing down and together,
&gt;and use it to hold the lockout plate and the bracket under the bus
&gt;together while you guide the orchestrated mess into place from above,
&gt;with two hands (ie, bolt the lockout plate to the bracket, thru the
&gt;hole from inside the cab, without going thru the cover plate).

I did try this a couple of times and got pretty close to making it work.
I could usually get as far as having the one bolt holding it together,
the ball-and-socket joint mated, and the other bolt started.  Then, when
I tried to get the cover plate pivoted far enough on the started bolt
to be able to undo the hold-it-together bolt, I'd lose the ball-and-
socket joint, the pin would pop back, and I'd have to pull it all
apart and try again.

The original reason I took it apart was to replace the front shift
bushing.  I was hoping to be able to do it without taking the under-Bus
bracket down, but the tolerances are close enough that you can't do
this - AFAICT, you have to pull the front shift rod out, put the
bushing in the bracket, and then slide the shift rod back through
the bracket.

I was trying to put it back together with no bushing, which meant
that the bracket was fairly free to flop around on the shift rod.
After trying and failing a few times I realized I was going to have
to do this all again when I finally decided to replace the bushing,
so I crawled under the Bus to remove the front shift rod.

Safety wire cut.  Penetrating oil applied.  :time passes:  OK,
time to try the setscrew.  *snap*  Dang, I figured that might
happen.  (Didn't use heat from a torch 'cause I didn't want to
wreck the OG plastic cover over the heater tube).  Break out the
Dremel tool with the fiberglass reinforced cutoff wheel.  Hey, I 
managed to slice the coupler and keep my shift rod intact, things
are looking up.  Thank you Albert J. Dremel.  Today, the FLVWPS
had an early shift coupler but not a late one, so I have one on
order.

All this is to be expected when you're dealing with a car that's
nearly 39 years old, I guess.  Mostly I was frustrated because
I had just got done fixing some other stuff and I wanted to take
it out for a drive.  I did discover that Craftsman flat ratcheting
wrenches don't work very well at all after you get p!ssed and throw
them at the driveway.  Oh well, that's what the warranty is for,
right?  :)
