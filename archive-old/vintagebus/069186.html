Subject: Re: [VB] BYOB camping

Two years ago a bunch of us camped at a great state park over in Santa
Cruz...absolutely beautiful!  The only drawback was that it was a bit of
a drive to get back over to KP...that and if you're going to leave with
Ronnie, you'd better be fast at getting up and going!  He waits for no
one ;-)

&gt; Does anyone have campgound reservations for the saturday night (April 12) of
&gt; BYOB? It seems to work out every year that we are able to split the cost and
&gt; camp as a group after the BYOB show.
