Subject: RE: [VB] Lets discuss this.....

&gt;I have been wanting to go with a 2.0 liter 914 for some time. In doing my
research I have discovered that for about the same price I could put in a
2.2T 911. &lt;

Not really.  You can build a decent T4 engine for the price of an early used
911 engine.  These are very different animals.  IF the 911 engine needs
rebuilt in the near future after you get in expect a hefty bill (and these
engines are something very few people can realistically rebuild at home - in
my opinion, the special tools needed are very pricey alone).

You will have to cut up your bus to get the oil sump in and I think you need
to cut the rear apron as well.  Not a drop in installation for the 911
engine.

The T4 is no piece of cake either.  To do it RIGHT and have a DTM upright
conversion (which are going to be very scarce for a while now that Joe
passed away last week) expect a 3-4K bill.  But the T4 does work well and
provides years of service.  A much better engine in numerous ways over the
T1 (except heads/exhaust). No one should take a used T4 motor and slap it
into a bus either, the rod bearings spin on that thing very easily and
should always be replaced.

In my opinion the best route these days is to get a new AL case and start
with it as a base for a high torque T1.  A lot of people really like the
1776(90.5x69), 1799(88x74), 1904(90.5x74), and 2010(90.5x82) in bus
applications.  Granted a 2010 is pushing the envelope a little bit for my
conservative tastes.   Yah yah, I have heard the BS about the AL case being
all screwed up, but it is robust and a great bottom end once you have it
checked out and corrected where necessary (if at all).  I figure a $500 case
(with machining) is a lot cheaper than any other alternative out there.
Put some of Shad's Birals (90.5) on there with JE true forged pistons and
you have one hell of a motor that can easily hit 150K and maybe a lot more.
Especially with CIS fuel injection :)  http://www.lnengineering_dot_com/

As for the disc/drum issue... I will take discs any day over drums.

and custom T1 questions.
