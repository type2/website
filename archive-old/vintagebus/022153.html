There is no year 2000 calendar planned by NEATO at this point...

The only bus 2000 calendar I know of at this point is the one being 
produced by the German late model bus club.  There are a couple of 
interesting late models in it, but no split windows...  :(

Anyone wanting a copy of their calendar, the price is 15DM for the 
calendar and add 8DM for postage.
