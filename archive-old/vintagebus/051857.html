Subject: First Drive observations

I finally got a plate on the old beast, and took it for a drive
64 kombi with a unknown displacement dual port / single carb
Reduction boxes were previously removed.
Type 1 style rearend previously installed.

will do 40 in third gear no problem, but is a little scary as it wanders.
jacked it up and all looks and feels tight, no slop anywhere, sooo

First plate on this vehicle since 1994!
