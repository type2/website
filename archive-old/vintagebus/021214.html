Subject: Re: [VB] Door Hinge Problem

I hat to say it, but you'll have to open the pillar.  The plates
are kept in place by a small bracket tack-welded to the inside, and
they break very easily :(

&gt; Now that I have removed all rusty parts to my new 65 walk thru
&gt; deluxe.(Floors, rockers, frame supports, jack points, doglegs, and most
&gt; everything 10&quot; up from bottom of bus) I started to remove cargo doors. 
&gt; First hinge(top), bolts came right out after soaking for three weeks with
&gt; WD40.  Bottom hinge would not budge.  Got out hand breaker with Phillips
&gt; head and pounded away. Both bolts came out without damage to heads but, as
&gt; I pulled out the second bolt the plate slid down inside the door frame. 
&gt; How do I get the plate out and how do I get it back in place and keep it
&gt; there?  The other lower hinge came out but I stuck a piece of welding rod
&gt; in one hole so plate would not slide down door frame. 
&gt; Any suggestions or solutions would be greatly appreciated.
