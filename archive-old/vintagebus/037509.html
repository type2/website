&lt;&lt; Craig, did you check your intake manifold to see if it's worn threw where
 the heat riser and the manifold are mated. Also it's a bummer but 30 pict1
 electric choke are no longer manufactured and/or imported. At this time all
 that are available are 30 pict1 manual choke.
 As for testing for intake leaks Aqua-Net hair spray in the aerosol can, all
 the other stuff like WD 40, carb cleaner etc., are made to EPA friendly to
 really work, but that HAIR Spray will work like a dream and it has holding
 power. Think of the nice lacquer finish it will leave on your painted parts.

and maybe you could temporarily glue a patch on with the hairspray too!!!!

Ronnie, I didn't think you used hairspray!!!!!
