Talk to the paint people, not parts people.  Paint my westy velvet green/blue 
white about 3 years ago now, and the paint shop had recipes when I brought in 
the L paint code.   THose guys wer very cool about understand that I wanted 
it just exactly the way the colour should be, and when their blue white was 
too green were cool about remixiing more so there is loads of paint layers of 
bluw whhite on that bus, like 5 or 6 and it was hard to put the solid side 
windows in, but go to the paint store.   Hopefully with some samples, like an 
over head vent plate, that was polished, to get a good indication of what the 
paint should be like. In a message dated 2/7/01 2:29:37 PM Pacific Standard

 Ok, I've been talking to the local parts people and I've come to the
 conclusion that most of them are idiots.  Can someone please help me. I'm
 looking for a cross reference for the following paint codes into a base coat
 clear coat system:
 
 L380 Turquoise/L289 Blue white
 L325 Mouse grey/L87 Pearl white
 
 The only thing I've been able to drag out of them is that L380=8040 in
 DuPont and L289=8033 in DuPont, but they said they cannot mix that kind of
 paint anymore, and can't find a cross in a base-coat clear-coat system.
 
 Can someone help me out?
