 A couple years ago I bought a perfect fiberglass repo rear ribbed bumper
(bus, not pickup) from BFY. They had made 10 and this was the last one. Paid
$100 for it with shipping. They might still have the mold or know where it
is. Worth a try. If someone can track it down let me know as I have a friend
in Havasu who's parents own a boat manf. company and can get fiberglass work
gone at a good discount. Might be a way to get some rr ribbed bumpers untill
metal ones are found. The 58 panel that I put the f/g rear on was bought by
a german air force officer stationed in N.M. and he was having it shipped
back it Germany.
