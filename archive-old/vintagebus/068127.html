Subject: RE: [VB] drag link replacement

... although this may not what you want to hear, hammer away!!
I remember getting into a similar death match right at a year ago with the
tie rods (which prompted an interesting thread about removing tie rods and
the right tools; its worth a browse of the archives).  Fortunately for me
the drag link was the easy one to get off/replace.  In the case of the tie
rod that would not come off, I hammered the pickle fork into place stuck a
cheater bar on the end of the fork.  I then jumped on the cheater bar to
break it free.

Unfortunately, I dont think you have the room to hook up a cheater bar to
the pickle fork here.  Heat (and specialty tools which Conrad covered) were
also suggested last year.

Good luck!!

Then came the lost battle. A friend lent me his pickle fork and sledge
hammer to use to drive the tie rod ends out. After hard hammering for about
a half hour, I felt like I needed to ask the gurus for a consultation. If
hammering is what needs to happen, then hammering will happen again. Does it
need to be heated? I read a few days ago that some other parts may need to
be disassembled  to get the drag link out. Is this the case? Advice needed
to find the way through this challenge. Thanks in advance for guidance.
