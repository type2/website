Wrong, when I got my bus, there were some clips that were nut and bolted on, 
the head of the little bolt goes on the drum side of the wheel. Speaking of 
this, recently I saw the tool for holding the rivets while you smash them for 
something like $45.00, and also heard that you can get the clips through the 
dealer for $.75 each.
