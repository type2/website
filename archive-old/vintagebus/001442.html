&lt; I'm gonna have to get me some heaterboxes for my 66 bus - for

&gt; Do not get those.  They do not put out the heat during the
&gt; winter, and cause the engine to run hotter during the summer.
&gt; Matter of fact VW got rid of them due to this problem


Many people do not realize that not all Dansk heat exchangers are the same.
Dansk makes two different quality levels.  These low-end Dansk boxes are a
definate example of &quot;you get what you pay for.&quot;  You'd might as well save
your money and just buy J-tubes. I won't even list them on my website. The
heavy duty Dansks (which I sell for $99) are reasonably decent quality,
however.

But by far your best deal are my N.O.S. German VW heater boxes for $179 a
pair, while I have them left.  These blow away even the &quot;good&quot; Dansks by a
wide margin, and for less money.  But there's a catch.  The tab for the
heater cable is set up for a '68-71 bus.  To make the heater lever work
correctly in a splitty you'd have to do minor modification, i.e. weld or
bolt another extension tab onto the linkage similarly to what Dansk's heat
exchangers (which are &quot;universal bug/bus&quot;) have. Or if you're lazy like me,
just wire the boxes open in the winter with a piece of wire, which was what
I did on my '63 deluxe, figuring that during an east coast winter there
would be no situation where I _wouldn't_ want my heat on; in the spring I
just snipped the piece of wire.  In either case, modifying the linkage is
well worth the effort because you will not find anything else approaching
this quality for this price.
