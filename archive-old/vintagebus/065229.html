 I might be able to get a set of flapper control cables 80/83 Air Cooled
when the mud in the wrecking yard dries out some more $50.00 the pair if
I can get them.
I have a full set of steel tubes to connect the heating system on Federal
Exhaust but I don't want to break the set $100.00 for all 4 connector
pipes.
I have the one steel connector pipe for right passenger side at $25.00
I also have the plastic accordion type tubes with the red silicone
adapters that connect the flappers to the big plastic crossover $50.00
the pair.
If you have Cal only system I've got some other parts for Cal only
systems.
Not Shown:
2 Federal drivers heater boxes.
4 Federal and Cal heater boxes passenger side.
1 Cal only heater box driver side.
2 Cal only crossover pipes.
