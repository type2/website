--- Gary Morgan &lt;morganwerk_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt; spoke up:
&gt; I'm not sure where you live but Gabriel from
&gt; Stockton, CA is a excellent resource. He brings 
&gt; his setup to the Cal shows and fixes locks and 
&gt; cuts keys right there for you. You can send your 
&gt; locks to him for service also.
&gt; I don't have a email, but his phone is 209-475-0868
&gt; 

Gabriel's e-mail address is gabvwkeys_at_cs_dot_com.  Very
resonable and I've had very good experience - and I
don't live any where near Stockton!  LOL!

Paul
