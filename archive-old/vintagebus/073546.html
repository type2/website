&gt; Is there another trick to getting the tie rod end out of the tie rod tube? 

Hi Jason,
Heating suspension parts with a torch is not a good idea.  If the part cools 
rapidly it hardens and becomes more brittle and possibly shatter sooner than 
later with use.  Repeated heating/cooling cycles can really harden things up 
even more.  If the part cools slowly it aneals the steel and softens it possibly 
to the point that it is more bendable!  Interestingtly these processes are 
reverse for most non-ferrous metals!
  In a pinch you can use two hammers.  Put one hammer against the side of the 
part the tie rod goes through and hit it on the opposite side with the other 
hammer.  This momentarly  slightly deforms the tapered hole into an oval and 
pops the tie rod out.
    If the above fails, or it is just best to have the proper wrench driven 
press tool as seen in the VW Workshop manuals to pop the tie rods out.
