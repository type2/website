I watched an argument at a Porsche concours where a guy with a late-model
widebody speedster was arguing with the judge (Dwight Mitchell) over the
*color* of the oil filter.  There was no doubt it was an OG oil filter,
one guy said it was supposed to be orange, the other guy thought yellow.  
The car had barely 1000 miles on it - in all likelyhood it hadn't had an 
oil change yet, much less a filter change.

I see a lot of anal-retentiveness in the VW community, as to seeking out
the perfect parts, but our cars are not judged to those standards.  In
a lot of cases, the AR-ness is for naught, as people overdo the body
and paint and make it incorrect as hell anyway.  

I have a few non-correct things I'm thinking about doing to the '54
deluxe from hell, just because I have the parts and don't necessarily want
to sell 'em.  Like a set of NOS pre-54 &quot;body bumpers&quot; aka rub strips.
I think they'd look cool as hell on there.  Then I could sell my NOS
ribbed rear bumper and retire.

&gt; Of course it is, we're talking about classic cars here.  I know a couple
&gt; of Model A ford fanatics who not only look for the correct markings but
&gt; also for the correct plating.  Having zinc plated bolts where the bolts
&gt; should be galvanized means the difference between winning and losing at a
&gt; Ford show!
