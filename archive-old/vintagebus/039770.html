I used to drive my 63 all the time. Now I dont use it much, just 
occasionally to take (gasp I never thought I would say this) garbage and 
recyclables out. About 1 time per month or so. Has stuttering on start up 
but slowly returns to normal. Anyway this summer I have used another vehicle 
to haul some tools where I needed them, used the bus to help get a kids bug 
going (going fast that is) and ended up putting the tools scattered between 
the house, another car, and the garage.
I took the bus out tonight, dropped off recyclables, and some garbage, and 
was headed home. I heard a funny noise, almost imperceptable, with the 
engine going, the open windows, the radio. RED LIGHT ON. Uh oh. Parked as 
quick as I could under a street light. Looked at the engine.
Broken fan belt. Yep. No problem.......WAIT! No tools! I have not broken a 
fan belt ever. I used to baby my busses, check all things out at each oil 
change, each valve job. Now I havent greased, oil chamged or adjusted valves 
in a year at least. Stupid ME.
I looked around and found a cresent wrench wedged under the seat, and a old 
screwdriver. Now I must have a belt here 
somewhere......no.......no.......YES. Wrong size idiot. Why am I carrying it 
around then. Search again........found one sitting in the back opposite the 
battery tray you know the other side. Oh Yeah! Replaced belt, went on my 
way.
MORAL: THIS BUS IS OLD. All busses need to be kept up, and most important 
all busses need the bare assortment of tools, ALL THE TIME.

BTW: Do keep up on looking at parts that can wear. When the fan belt flew, 
it took out the fresh air tubes and my oil temp sender (I use a temp guage). 
A loss that never needed to happen.
