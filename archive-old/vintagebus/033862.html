Here's a question...

Were Riviera's the only campers to sport the long horizontal window running
down the length of the bus on the driver's side just aft of the driver's
door?
I'm asking because I just saw some pics of a sundial interior, and it looks
just like the interior on my 67' Riviera.  Unfortunately out here on the
East Coast, we don't have many Riviera's to compare with, so when the PO
told me it was a Riviera, I believed them face value.  Could I perhaps have
a Sundial?
