For the  two-speed, self-parking wiper motor, what is the mechanism that
causes the  motor to self park?   My 67 just failed state inspection
because  the motor parks the wiper in the middle of the windshield.   This
hadn't been a problem to me, because I had found that if I turn off  the
switch at just the right time, the wiper will park to the side, but  the
state inspector didn't know the trick, so my bus has a nice black  reject
sticker until I can fix it.

Just in time for a weekend  project 8^)

Thanks for suggestions,

someone had the motor out at some point.   You have to undo a  certain 10mm 
screw and reset the postion of the safts.   I could show  you , but it's hard 
to explain.  Where are you at?   I'll try to  take a pic of the thing that 
needs adjusting.
