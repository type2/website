&lt;&lt; Also, what should I do about the rear heat?  I have a Westy folding bed 
over the rear heater tube and I'm curious how the heat flow will be back 
there since the tube is basically in a big box. &gt;&gt;
Hi again Jon,
&gt;From what we remember the westie packages that were made for buses with the 
rear heater had a westie factory slit cut into the rear seat wood to let out 
the heat under seat area.  Otherwise you would cook whatever you had stored 
there.  Maybe checking out other westies is in order and if you can find one 
that has the slit but not the rear heater tube they might be willing to 
trade, or maybe duplicate the slit in your seat base.   Eric&amp;Barb
