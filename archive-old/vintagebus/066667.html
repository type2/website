Subject: Dead Battery

Hiya gang,
Went out this morning to start up the ol' 67 Sundial for my commute to work,
and my battery was so low that the engine would barely turn over.  Lights/cd
player/guages all still work.  I noticed while driving yesterday that my cd
player kept cutting out, as though the power was being momentarily
interupted.  Thought I probably needed to check the ground, which I was
planning on doing when I got home today.  My battery was replaced less than
6 months ago.  I will get it checked this afternoon anyway, but I'm
wondering if this scenario sounds familiar to anyone on the list?  I'm still
running a generator, figuring that the next time I have the engine out for
any reason, I will switch over to an alternator.  My warnign lights are
functioning properly, and there was no red light on when running prior to
this incidence.

Any suggestions.  Figure I probably need to check my voltage regulator, (can
this be done) and generator.  TIA
