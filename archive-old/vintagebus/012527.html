 I am trying to remove the brackets from the bumper
on my 67 kombi to weld them up a bit but the long
bolt that connects the upright bracket spins. There seems
to be no way of getting on the nut as it is behind a
peice of metal on the upright bracket. Do you have to cut
the bolt then get the bumper apart to get at the nut, or is
it supposed to be welded on the back side of the steel plate?
                               Thanks in Advance
                                       Matt
