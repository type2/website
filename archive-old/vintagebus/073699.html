Subject: The Great Western Tour Website

For the 3rd year two of the Buskatiers Founders', Rob Laffoon(P-Daddy) 
and Terry Wolfe will be doing a tour of the upper midwest and the 
northern Rocky Mountains. We will be joined by several other busses this 
year. Bryant Baecht from Kansas will join us from the start. Other 
possible participants are still planning.
We will be leaving Omaha on Sunday July 27th. Heading north and west 
across Nebraska. Our schedule is very flexible but we are headed to 
Glacier National Park. After lots of miles we will be heading to the 
Rocky Mountain Motorworks show on August 9th in Woodland Park Colorado 
and the Bandimere Show in Denver before heading home. We expect  to hit 
parts of Idaho and Utah before heading to Colorado. We should be 
travelling about 4000 miles in 2 weeks. We would love to meet up with 
other bus folks as we travel. If you are anywhere in the area and would 
like to have a bunch of  bus crazies stop by please feel free to drop me 
a pmail before we leave.
