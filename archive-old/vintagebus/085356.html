Subject: Re: [VB] Brake Pedal problem.

Thanks Karl,

Found the page about 60 seconds before I got your post. I spent about 2 
hours this afternoon cleaning and puzzling over the problem. The pedal 
assembly was recently worked on by a mechanic that for the moment will 
remain un-named and I don't think it was properly put back together. Looks 
to me like something is missing. Possibly a spacer bushing.
