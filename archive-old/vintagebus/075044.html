Subject: RE: [VB] Pedal pan covers (under pedal cover plate)

  We made these as a universal style . There are 4 different pedal pans from
1955 to 1967 (at least that I have here). When putting these all together we
are using the one that could be trimmed easily to fit any year bus. This was
a lot easier then making 4 different styles. We are fitting it on a 63 and a
67 bus today, a 56 tomorrow. We will be able to provide a templete of where
and waht would need to be trimmed for each specific year of application.

Don't 1967's have a one year only splash pan that is cut differently to go
around the master cylinder or something like that?  I know that my splash
pan scrapes against the master cylinder when I try to put it on.  Thanks.

&gt;    Type2parts_dot_com is pleased to announce a new product we are making. We
all
&gt; know how hard it is to find the under pedal cover pans for our buses (1955
&gt; to 1967) so we have decided to reproduce them out of fiberglass.
&gt;    I have just approved the prototype part and after a few improvements
they
&gt; will be ready for sale. These look exactly as originals and now you don't
&gt; have to worry about them rusting.
&gt;    If you are coming to OCTO I will have it displayed and if you are only
&gt; coming to the Classic look for my Aussie container van in the freak show
and
&gt; I will also have it displayed their.
&gt;   I will post pics on The Samba later and vintagebus_dot_com today. Projected
&gt; cost on these will be $75.00 dollars each.
