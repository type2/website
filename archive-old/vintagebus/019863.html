i don't remember exactly how to remove it, but when you put the thing back
together, DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN the nut!

I did this, and the wheel locked on me going around 60 mph. welded the bearing
to the spindle.

Unfortunately I don't remember exactly how to tighten properly, so i won't
give out any mis-info, but muir mentions it in his book(i just missed it the
first itme i read it)

something like you tighten it a cretain amount, then back the nut out a
certain number of turns.

good luck
