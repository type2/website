I don't think it's that, so much as it can be hard to detect the
change in brightness, particularly if the lights have poor grounding,
and thus the brightness change is small; or if they aren't watching at
the exact instance of brightness change.  Even on vehicles with
separate brake and running lights, studies showed that having a third
brake light significantly improves others noticing that something's
happening.  That's why third brake lights are now mandated, after all.

I know I've followed older vehicles with all sorts of light
arrangements, and having that third eye really is the best thing for
getting my attention that what's in front of me is getting serious
about slowing down.  Given that people are getting used to others
having those, I'm convinced the only long-term safe solution is to
have one, as well.
