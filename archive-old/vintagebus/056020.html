Subject: RE: [VB] NOS round bus side mirror

I got one from Bus Boys that says FLAT 4 on it. It is polished, and
using a REAL clamp (had that), it stays put. Don't think it has numbers
or stating it is made in ASIA at all, but not a super accurate repop I
guess. Shiny, nice glass though, about 30+ bucks from Bus Boys. Not
really the answer you want, but I will see if there are any real ones on
the two buses I am checking out for parts repop this weekend.

Subject: [VB] NOS round bus side mirror


No-one responded to my last Q.  There has got to be
someone out there who has seen or may have a NOS side
mirror.  I would like to know what the finish on the
back side of the housing looks like.  Is it polished
aluminum like i think or something else?

How do you tell a good quality Repro from a NOS one
besides the loose mount stud, missing #'s on the back
ring, box that says china, etc.

ANYONE????

thanks
Matthew
