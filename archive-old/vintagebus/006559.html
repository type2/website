and that kind of reminds me of my kids. They're only 7 and 5 but my son (the
7 year old) is so much in Volkswagens now, I can't stop him. I can't take
away little VW cars I bought to put on the shelf. He plays with them on
regular bases. I didn't &quot;kill&quot; him when he broke off rear bumper off my 1/18
scale Bus. Now I'm working on my new engine for the 65 and he's there with
me always trying to &quot;help&quot;. I let him cause I know how important it is to
have bond with your child. They want to participate and that's what makes me
happy. I bought a 65 and my son has not even seen it yet. It's gonna be a
surprise since it's the color that my son always wanted, sealing wax red.
Coming into my garage next weekend. I mean why would you want to treat your
kids like strangers??? not even that, something worse!

&gt; The bit about the 18 year old son reminds of a story I
&gt; heard about a fellow who collected Corvettes (not
&gt; everyone can have the good taste we share on this
&gt; list), and never let his kids even help wash them when
&gt; the kids were young, for fear of them scratching
&gt; something or leaving a water stain.  Of course, when
&gt; the kids were older and the father wanted them to
&gt; share his interest in his cars, they hated the things,
&gt; and wanted nothing to do with cars as a hobby.
&gt;
&gt; Moral of the story: Let the kids help, start them
&gt; young, even if they make mistakes; keep them
&gt; interested.  Help them grow up to be someone you want
&gt; to leave that treasured VW bus to.
