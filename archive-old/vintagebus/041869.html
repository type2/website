&gt; Have they shown you the picture of the nuke plant control room with
&gt; beer tap handles on the control levers yet?  (Reference the book,
&gt; &quot;The Design of Everyday Things&quot;.)  I think the problem was that
&gt; there were a number of identical control levers next to one another
&gt; that had to be operated while watching a gauge reading elsewhere.
&gt; However, to get the right lever, you had to look away from the
&gt; gauge.  The plant operators put three different beer tap handles
&gt; on the levers so they could tell them apart by feel.

They stole this idea from aircraft controls, so that the pilot wouldn't
(for example) grab the flap control when he wanted to retract the gear!

The gear knob was made in the shape of a tire, the flap knob was in the 
shape of a little wing, the mixture control was red
and had a &quot;spikey&quot; shape (like the spikes of flame) and the throttle was
round and smooth.  When in doubt, push all controls forward!
