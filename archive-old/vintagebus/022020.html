  Hi Steve,     In a message dated 98-08-06 01:58:04 EDT, you wrote:

&lt;&lt; I'm currently pondering the &quot;what engine should I put in the 65 Westy&quot;
 question.  I think that I want to keep it as stock as I can, so I guess
 that means single port.  The 65 had an H case 1500 in it originally.&gt;&gt;
It kind of depends on what you want to do with your bus.  Drive or trailer
only to shows or just in town driving.  Drive real quick from 0-60, or drive
long distances at 60+MPH reliably, good gas MPG, and easy to work on and get
parts for.  
 
 &lt;&lt;The motor that came out of it is an AE 1600SP which I've not yet  examined.
It turns freely, and seems to have compression (how much is  still a mystery)
but thats all I know.&gt;&gt;  
 Sound like a good core to go through compleatly and rebuild yourself.  The AE
cases are about the best stock cases built by VW.   
&lt;&lt;My question is this:  Should I go out and search for  a rebuildable &quot;H&quot;
case to keep it totally original, or if the AE case is good just build a
runner on that?&gt;&gt;
Again it depends on what you are going for in a engine.  You could even do
both and have the H case for a back up engine and/or show engine.
&lt;&lt; I know that the later case has the dual oil relief valves.  Is it that much
better than the 1500 H?&gt;&gt; 
The AE case should have dual relief valves and we have seen that this type of
case gets about twice the oil pressure as a single relief valve case will at
higher operating oil temps.  You could in theory could bore the main oil H
case passages as large as the dual relief case, counterbore larger cooler
holes in the case to bolt a doghouse cooler there, and install the later
larger dia. oil sump pickup tube.  We are doing this to a 40HP engine to see
if these changes will work.  The AE case has a alloy that reputedly is harder
and thusly more durable than the H case especially for racing purposes.     
&lt;&lt; BTW I plan on making  the motor a 1641 and I still want to use the stock
carb and vac dizzy. &gt;&gt;
We are using a 30PICT-1 carb on a single port 1641cc and a 010 distributor.
Getting 24 MPG average doing 64MPH at 3,000RPM with 1964-67 reduction gear
boxes on our 1960 panel with full roof racks and camping interior and gear.
