Subject: Re: [VB] Hippies- One last clarification, it wasn't them!!

There's a bunch of brand new bike trailers for sale surrounding our local HD 
dealerships. 




This is much better, bashing HD owners instead of eating our young!

p.s. Coming soon, the second wave of people coolers for your summertime VW 
cruising comfort. Ellis has prototype #1 and I'll offer the second and third to 
the Havasu boyz during the Classic. You might have seen it at Jerome last year. 
&gt; &gt;Every time I see twenty Harley Davidson going down the road driven by
&gt; &gt;Doctors, Lawyers, Real Estate Brokers, Stock Brokers (or others that can
&gt; &gt;afford $25K + motorcycle) I see at least one fully restored VW van of
&gt; &gt;some year following them with a supply of Beer, Bandages, Snacks and
&gt; &gt;whatever the new wave Harley crowd needs to support their trips.
&gt; 
&gt; Cell phones and Viagra?
