Subject: won't idle

Alright... heres the deal..
brand new mexican motor...won't idle... it'll rev just fine...but will
not idle....it will idle high IF the stepped choke cam is not fully in
the &quot;on&quot; position.  If the choke is FULLY open...it will not idle...
even with the throttle arm all the way down.  If I pump the gas...it
will rev though...
I tried 2 different carbs...no help.  The one that is on there I rebuilt
with a rebuild kit and copius amounts of carb cleaner....replacing both
diaphrams  ( 34PICT-3 )
I tried the adjustment screws in many different positions...but to no
avail.. I replaced the faulty idle cutoff switch with a good one.
The dizzy is a 009 and worked on the previous motor just fine. I reset
the points (.016) and cleaned them up...and tried different timing from
20' ATDC to 20' BTDC...mainly sticking at 0' TDC.
The thing that has me wondering is the choke... I don't think its
getting enough fuel at idle...even though i cleaned all the passages in
the carb(s).  You could eat off of that carb it so clean.  i even took
the gasket out from underneath the fuel pump thinking it wasn't pumping
enough...but it is.  New needle valve too.  The fuel pump is pumping
just fine. New fuel filter also.
I checked for intake leaks by spraying carb cleaner at all the possible
leak points... no leaks.  All the appropriate vacuum lines are plugged
to accomodate the 009.  I even tried a different vac. advance dizzy to
no avail.
I also tried adjusting the screw on the throttle arm...but that didn't
help either...once that cam is in the fully &quot;open&quot; position...it just
quits.

Whats going on here?!

ANY ideas????

Isaiah
