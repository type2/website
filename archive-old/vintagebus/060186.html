Subject: Re: [VB] re:rear seat-actually middle seat


[...]

It is a 68 to 79 bay window full middle seat. There are 2 different
styles/years. 68 - 72  and 73 - 79. Early has a smooth top. Late has headrest
holes on top. [Headrests started in 73]


&gt; well i searched the samba classifieds and i guess this is more likely a
&gt; middle seat, as about 1/3 of the backrest flips forward - i guess to allow
&gt; passengers to the rear seat.
&gt;
&gt; upholstery has a basket weave type of pattern on it, the sides are smooth.
&gt; the basket weave type of stuff is a whitish vinyl, and the sides are gray.
