the post 63 upper indent is the same as the pre 62 safari only indent im
pretty sure, so you can get that section out of any post 63 bus... if you
are picky that it must be correct, im sure you could buy the section out
of the bus im talking about if you want to p-mail me...

I,m not pickin on your bus, it looks beautiful... i just wanted to point
out that the safari mounting isnt completely original, nothin wrong with
that, just that its not the same as factory exactly.

enjoy your bus and i look forward to seeing it and meeting you someday :)

take care,

Steve
