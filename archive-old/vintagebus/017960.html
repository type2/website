Subject: new header ?
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id TAA67349

just installed the nw header on my motor today...the old one had lost a clamp
and the pipe had a hole in it where it attaches to the heater box..probably
due to vibration. The new one fit pretty well, although the muffler now sits a
little differently. The bus seems much quieter.

Now a quick question, at the top of the header it connects to the engine at
two points/ kind of perpendicular to each other. At one point there is a small
hole, and the other is a larger hole. On my previous header the small hole on
the passenger side was completely clogged/rusted closed...does this matter.
Does air pass through at this spot, or only at the larger hole.

This is a single port 1600.
