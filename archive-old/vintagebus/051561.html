Subject: RE: [VB] valve noise on new rebuild 1600 sp engine

did i miss something? were the heads rebuilt or are they new? i don't
remember seeing the original post mentioning one way or the other.
why even bother with rebuilt heads when the cost of new ones is minimally
more than rebuilt?
if they are rebuilt, were the seats cut too deeply? were the guides
replaced (as mentioned)? are the adjusters/rocker arms in proper
alignment/geometry?

[a reply]
&gt; When you had the heads rebuilt did they replace the guides. I have found
&gt; that sometimes one of the problems causing the valves to loosen quickly
are
&gt; worn guides, changing the valve adjustment constantly. Another problem I
&gt; have found are worn out valve adjusting screws. You adjust all properly
only
&gt; to have them loosen imediatly after running the engine. Just a couple more
&gt; ideas.

&gt; 
&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; The valves or really noisy on my new rebuild. Still in the break in phase
&gt; with less that 200 miles on it. I adjusted the valves today and most were
&gt; about .010&quot;. Only one required no adjustment. It seems to me that as the
&gt; valves seat, the adjustment would get tight not loose. Is my thinking
wrong
&gt; here?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, after the adjustment the noise seemed slightly worse. Being
&gt; paranoid, I got out my St. Muir engine noise tape, and sure enough, it
&gt; sounds exactly like the &quot;loose valve&quot; engine. It appears to be on the left
&gt; side of the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll wait till I have another morning free and go through the valve
&gt; adjustment again, but I am hardly a novice at this procedure.
