Ken,

I'm glad that you figured out your starter problem.

I had a problem with the starter on my sister's Jetta. Changed the
starter twice, tore the dash apart and checked the wiring at the
ignition switch, tried a low-voltage relay and everything...

Turned out that the problem was that the ground strap to the
transmission was loose. A simple 5 minute fix that took me several hours
of work and all of my curse words to find...

david
