Subject: new ebay scam page

ebay supposedly suspended me, and when i went to the webpage they 
gave me, they began asking for mother's maiden name, SS # etc. do not 
EVEN enter your ebay password... it is a scam that i traced to 
cornell's students :)  looks just like ebay, same as the one reported 
earlier,, but has a dotted quad in the addy, so is easier to spot. 
if an ebay site asks for any info like the above mentioned, BEWARE!! 
it ain't real.
