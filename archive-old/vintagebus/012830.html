Eric, Barb, et all
 just throwing my $0.02 in:)
 Years ago when I drove a big truck (89 International
 Eagle w/Range Rover 10 speed, 6V 92 Detroit engine)
 the only time you use the clutch is when taking off
 from a dead stop:) No matter if your bob-tailing or
 over-loaded. When trying to explain to folks how to
 to shift w/o using a clutch, tell em to listen to a
big truck. Shift _at_ low RPMs, diesel engines, as with
 VWs, create power _at_ a low RPMs, its one of the
easiest
 vehicules to &quot;power shift&quot;.
  To this day I catch myself in the B*g power shifting
 without thinking about it, until i miss a gear:o At
 least ya aint gotta come to a complete stop in a VW
 to get another go at it:)
  Your right tho... every person that drives ANY
 standard trans auto needs to learn to power shift &amp;
 do it correctly. In my opinion if done right it gives
 more life to your drivetrain, less wear on clutch
 componets, less jerking around of trans mounts, ect.
 People tell me &quot;That'll wear out your trans in no
 time...&quot; they dont believe me that a person can get
 well over a million miles out of a big truck trans
 if properly maintananced:) I dont do it in the B*g on
 purpose, just out of habit:)
  Later,
