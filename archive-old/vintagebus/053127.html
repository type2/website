Subject: Ethics question

Whats the difference between hawking your &quot;special&quot;, &quot;over stock&quot;,
&quot;just-in&quot; &quot;gotta clean out my garage&quot; part listing and an E-bay listing???

If one gets booted for the latter....why not the former?  Don't get me
wrong, I love seeing all the new stuff and great deals some of our members
provide. 

Just a question to the elders, since the swift sword of justice was weilded
recently (just saw Lord of the Rings...sorry) to someone who crossed the
&quot;line&quot;.  For a moment there I thought Ken was at the helm. ;-)

Yours truly,

Devl S. Advocate
