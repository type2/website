Here's a Friday topic.

When did VW change from the 8mmx1.25 with a 14 mm head to 8x1.25 w/  13 mm 
head?  A friend asked me this at our Thanksgiving get together, and I had no 
idea.  On some older busses, I grab a 13, and then have to go back and get 
the 14.
-  --  -- - - 
my guess is when they went from screw terminals to push on terminal in the 
wiring.   My first split was an early 59  and it had 14s.  I sold it and then 
 had a later  split bus, and I had to learn to grab a 13 instead of a 14.  my 
61 has 13s.
