Subject: Re: [VB] scary story. advice needed.

Hehe, 
I had the same prob you had when I was restoring it two years ago:)
I guess it worked a little too well!  They are holding fine now, but I'm 
having a hard time hopping in the bus until I know that I'm not going to loss 
a wheel while I take a corner and jeopardize my well being (or the bus for 
that matter!)
Cheers,
Pete
