Ok, I've been *very* liberal with list &quot;policing&quot; lately - almost to the point
of tree hugging, but with that &quot;freedom&quot; must come civility and self-control,
characteristics which this thread is lacking.

Please drop this thread, and convince me once again that I don't have to baby-sit
each and every subject that pops up.

Thank you.
