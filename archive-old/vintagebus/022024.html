Hi Chuck,
Yes, that is why we think the mixture is correct possibly, but that the fuel 
is still getting into the manifold.  While running it probably running fine 
with the fuel getting into the manfold due to adjusting for this without 
knowing it is happening.

&lt;&lt; But living down here in the So West a day like yesterday F 105 and parking 
on black asphalt can fry an egg, a VW and your fuel &gt;&gt;
Yes, but if so he would always have a problem of starting even if it had sat 
for a couple of hours due to no fuel in the carburetor if what you are 
thinking was happening.
