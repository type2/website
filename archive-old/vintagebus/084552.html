Subject: Re:[VB] Starter won't turn over with key

  I have had similar problems from time to time with my 70 &amp; 63 buses. The best fix is to put in a relay. This has worked for me eveer time. Modern vehicles have a relay to work the starter solenoid &amp; this upgrade is fine if you are not am absolute purist type.

&gt; I have recently gotten my 1960 DD on the road but have
&gt; had problems starting it with the key.  There is a wire
&gt; that runs straight from the battery to the solenoid for
&gt; starting when working on the engine. I never know when
&gt; the bus might start with the key or not.  At first I
&gt; thought it might be a &quot;hot start&quot; problem, but the bus
&gt; would starter would not tun over this morning.
