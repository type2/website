&gt;&gt;Hi all 
Let me introduce myself. My name is Olivier and I'm french and I'm new
on this 
big list. Usualy I'm intresting in Type H citroën van (I've one of
1978). I ve 
no VW type 2 at the moment but I'm dreaming of it.&lt;&lt;

Welcome, Olivier.  Many of us are dreaming of it.

You are correct that &quot;samba bus deluxe&quot; is the split window bus you're
looking for.  Some of us are lucky enough to find one in the USA.  How
to find one in France would be another problem.  At least you are closer
to Germany than most of us are.

Keep your eyes open.  Look for any advertisements in newspapers or auto
magazines where you are.  We would like to hear about what you can find.
 VW Type 2s made for the French market have some unique options (like
yellow headlights).  Let us know what you can find there.

I don't know if you will find &quot;some french guy&quot; who can inform you on
VWs in France.  So far we have not heard much from France on this list. 
After you find one, you won't need a French guy to help you.  Your
English is good enough to communicate with this online group of VW fans.
 They can help with advice on how to do just about anything---except
find parts in France.

One thing, though.  Watch the offer to the girlfriend.  She'll get the
bus.
