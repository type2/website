Subject: Re: [VB] Full-Flow System Oil Pressure

The size of the lines does not determine pressure, but it does
determine the pressure loss in the circuit.  larger is better.

The only reason I say all the stupid things I say is that I've been
scrounging oil coolers from Rx7s, big Mercedes, Saab and everything else
in wrecking yards that have oil coolers.
Seems they all stop at about 1/2&quot; ID, with the exception being the
Porsche with the oil cooler all the way in the front and engine in the
rear, it uses 1&quot; lines and I've heard it runs at over 90 psi routinely.
When you start cutting the lines off, very few have fittings ID of over
3/8&quot; and those having Banjo Bolts normally have two 1/4&quot; holes (converted
to metric).
