&gt; &gt; Another tip is to use brake line in place of the original fuel line.  It's
&gt; &gt; thicker.
&gt;
&gt; How do you connect the brake line to the tank?  Their is a fitting at the
&gt; bottom of the tank, is it just a case of flaring the line and using the
&gt; current fixing?

No, this is just the line through the tin to the pump.  Cut off ends,
deburr, push hose on, clamp.

&gt; How far should the fixed line come through the tin?

Stock is about 3
inches.  I made mine a bit longer to get the hose away from the exhaust
pipe.

&gt; I guess replacing the line with metal is probably the best idea - VW
&gt; wouldn't of done it if it wasn't necessary.

Well, the VW fuel line setup seems to be aimed at easy installation of the
engine at the factory.  It can be improved upon if you are careful about
your engineering
