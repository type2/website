Subject: Re: [VB] Warning

Unfortunately, The deal was struck off of ebay after the auction had ended. He had good feedback too. My &quot;visa&quot; is actually my ATM card with a logo on it so I think I'm screwed. I do a have a Phone # and email and I think he runs carsonline_dot_com.au. So I will go from there. I figure that's $81.44 toward some CE Safari's , so revenge IS in order!

To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other.
