Subject: Re: [VB] clutch pedal zerk fitting

Hi Kevin,
Yes, that is the best place.  The pre-1961 Buses had that as a stock  item!  
Yes, you will have to drill the bushing, but that is standard  practice in any 
zerk fitting area.  We have had to take apart  the brake pedal twice in our 
1963 SC to lubricate it.  Will be  drilling and zerk fitting that next time to 
avoid any more repeats.
