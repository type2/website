&lt;&lt; However, the cut outs for the parking lights are not in the same place on 
the two buckets.  One of them is more forward (FIF) than the other.  Next 
strange occurance, on the headlight rings, one of them has adjusting screws 
at around 2 and 7 o'clock, and the other has the adjusting screws at 7 and 10

Hi Mike,
Best way to view bus/bug headlights is to just figure the mounting screw as 6 
O'clock position as it would be viewed mounted in a bug.  Otherwise due to 
the reverse mounting in the bus makes describing and remembering these alot 
harder.  1955 up to 3 DEC 63, Chassi # 1211643 (According to the VW bus 
workshop manuals section E-11 page 3) the head light buckets for bug/bus had 
thier adjusting screws in the chrome ring at 5 and 7 O'clock.  From 3 DEC 63, 
Chassi # 1211643 the adjusting screws were placed at 2 and 7 O'clock.  So you 
need to figure if yours is a late or early 64 model if you are going for the 
proper buckets.  The only differances between 1955-67 bus and bug head lights 
are, bus has drain holes in the bottoms of the chrome rings making these 
chrome  parts left or right side only.  The inner ring that the US style 
sealed bulb mounts into has differant placement of the slits that lock the 
ring tabs behind the bulb into locking the bulb into one position also making 
it left or right only.  Euro bucket have left and right only ribbed lenses, 
and the reflectors are L/R only.   Eric&amp;Barb
