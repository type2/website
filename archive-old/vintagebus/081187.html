Subject: BYOB/ kelley park/ wierd noise..ack!!!! (short)

BYOB &amp; Kelley Park were good.   Met some listees in person.   Actually had 
the first experience of someone introducing themself to me by email name (aka 
email address), which totally makes sense to do.  

This afternoon it rained.  Everyone disappeared.   I packed up and left.

after amazing traffic confusion snarls, to do with a railroad crossing sign 
that didn't turn off, but no railroad that I saw, I took an alternate route to 
my dad's house, which was the long way around.   On the freeway there started 
a wierd noise.   Kind of like fabric ripping.   from inside the bus?   where?  
 what is it?   a buzzing noise.    Stopped, looked around, no clue.    As 
soon as I hit 45mph, it started again.   Below ~45 it stopped.   Now definately 
from the overhead air vent.   REALLLYYYY irritating.   Buzzing.   bees buzz.   
I saw a yellowjacket in the bus a few days ago.  maybe it crawled into the 
vent and doesn't like the rain and wind.   It's very unhappy.

Could it be a bad bungee on the roof rack?     

These and many others questions may be answered in the fullness of time. But 
not now.  I'm too tired.

Clara
