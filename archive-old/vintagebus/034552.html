&lt;&lt; I forgot to ask.  Anyone know of a web site that lists all the US
 dealers back in the day?? &gt;&gt; 

 I may be able to get it from my Father in law.

I would also LOVE this list.  On another note, does ANYONE have license plate 
frames from Don Sharp Motors...Volkswagon, Oceanside, CA?  I would LOVE to 
have this frame for my bus, Don Sharp was my husbands Grandfather, one of the 
VERY first VW dealers on the west coast.  Can you believe we don't have ONE 
frame left over?  I would be willing to pay handsomely for this license plate 
frame.
Thanks, 
Laura Sharp
