I can think of a few real options:

- fix it right: split the case, weld in new material, drill and tap a
  new hole
- fix it semi-right: drill &amp; tap to a larger diameter, put in a case
  saver or helicoil (can theoretically be done without splitting the
  case, but only if you're *really* careful)
- teflon tape.  Requires that there be enough thread left to hold the
  sending unit once the thickness of the tape is added.
- find a plug bolt that fits moderately well, weld it over the sender
  hole.  This is not the best solution.
