Last night I took the first stab at writing routines to generate stats with
the registry.  Right now the formatting is next to useless, but it's
interesting all the same.

Yes, I *will* be sorting the tables.  IGotta figure out how to sort a hash
in perl.  At the same time though, I'm re-writing other sections of the
script with what I've learned, making them more efficient and faster.

Right now in stats format you get everything - the selectable criteria
don't do anything yet.
