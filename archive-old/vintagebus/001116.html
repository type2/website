Hello all. I asked a while back about how to make a contraption to rip the
rear end out of my bus and still be movable, I got some good ideas too.
Thanks to everyone. Anyway, would it be possible to take an old pair of
reduction boxes and cut the axle tubes off so that all you have is the box
itself. Then take the lower inner and outer bearings and the stub axle, put
all of this together and bolt it to the spring plate. Then I would ned to
put the drum back on with out the brake parts and the wheels and tires.
Would this setup be strong enough to hold the whole bus up? Does the axle
tube provide any stability to the rear end, or is it all supported by the
lower bearings? Anybody got some insight? Thanks.
