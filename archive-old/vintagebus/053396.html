Subject: Re: [VB] Mt. Shast Snow Trip  &lt;Tire chain advice&gt;

Which brings up a question. I never ever have had to
have snow chains, but I want to join in on this trip
because there wont be any lowered buses there. If I
were to pick up some chains at a garage sale what are
the chances that they will fit my 205/70/15's ? Do
chains very in saize too much to hope they will fit.
And what are the chances of throwing a chain into the
unshiney orig paint on my kombi? Anyone else planning
on going, I know the only list member that went last
year was Gene, and he is not currently on the list.
&gt; 
&gt; Thom, can you please pass this on. Thanks, Brian.
&gt; Make plans for Ground Hog Day Weekend- Feb 1st 2nd
&gt; and 3rd to drive to Mt. Shasta the long way...
&gt; through the woods, up and over the mountains and
&gt; across the streams where ice fishing,
&gt; skiing/snowboarding, train watching and awesome
&gt; scenery abound. Several hundred miles of
&gt; very-very-back road driving from Guerneville Ca. to
&gt; Mt. Shasta will take the whole day (drivers from
&gt; north can meet up halfway and those north of Mt.
&gt; Shasta are charged with mapping a route of equally
&gt; challenging secondary roads southward to Mt.
&gt; Shasta). Can your excellent bus make the trip? Do
&gt; you have the mechanical savvy if you break down 100
&gt; miles deep in the Mendocino National Forest? Were
&gt; you smart enough to have left your original heat
&gt; exchangers in place, knowing that being cool is not
&gt; being cold? Ever put snow chains on your bus not
&gt; because it was mandated for passage over I-80, but
&gt; because if you didn't have them on you'd be stuck?
&gt; Caravan through the woods with us on this second
&gt; annual Mt. Shasta Snow Trip for the best bus
&gt; adventure you've ever been on! (do you really think
&gt; driving freeways for hours on end in your bus is
&gt; adventure?) Check last year's web site for more
&gt; details as to what we're up to here.
&gt; www.sonic_dot_net/~mizamook/Shasta1htm Know that this
&gt; trip is not for the weak. Most drivers
&gt; unfortunately, are quite afraid of driving their
&gt; busses as they were designed... over the roads of
&gt; third world countries. While &quot;slammed&quot; busses may
&gt; suit the image-conscious land and mind-locked city
&gt; dwellers with related mental problems, stock
&gt; suspension and ride height are needed to cross some
&gt; of the minor streams and occasional radical road
&gt; conditions. If you have the metal, this trip is for
&gt; you. Write to me for more information. This ones for
&gt; those who put function over form! Thanks, Brian.
