Subject: Re: [VB] Will it run cooler if.....

it's a question of either/or as far as I can see.  running heater boxes (with 
air through them) cools the exhaust.   I would think this would make the 
heads run cooler (which is supported by my experience with a bad fan belt and a 
destroyed fresh air tube on a road trip, but no numbers for you) 

but w/o the fresh air tubes, yes more goes to the cylinders instead of 
cooling the exhaust.

  Though if someone has a head temp sensor and want to give number with the 
fresh air tube installed vs plugged off, that'd be neat.

I recently installed a gas heater in my bus (1600 DP),
thus eliminating the need for stock heat exchangers
(which mine are leaky and smelly anyway). I am trying
to logically decide if replacing stock heat exchangers
with J-tubes and plugging the heater air outlet ports
on the fan shroud will actually make the engine run
cooler.  Logic tells me this: if the outlet ports on
the fan shroud are blocked off, then then that means
MORE COOLING AIR to the cylinders which would
logically mean cooler running temps, right!?!?  Or I
am missing something here???
