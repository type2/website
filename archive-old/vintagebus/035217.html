Yes folks, we are doing it again. Saturday December 11, 1-5pm.  

If you are new to the list, we've opened up our home to listmembers for a
little holiday celebration for five years, now. Plenty of parking, gawking,
eating, some drinking, some camping in our driveway (reserve early).
Typically, this is a twenty odd bus event  that takes over our neighborhood.
Families, kids, spouses, encouraged to attend-this is not just a bunchaguys
crawling under vehicles. Your significant other will have a good time!

7001 Westmoreland Ave. Takoma Park MD 20912 (301) 270 8073 . That is inside
the Washington DC beltway, at the north end of town. For directions, input
the address into http://www.mapquest_dot_com, they'll give you better directions
than I can. Rain or shine.

For photos of past events, courtesy of our esteemed Tom Carrington, look
under &quot;Holiday Parties&quot; at http://volksweb.relitech_dot_com/

If you can, please rsvp to calliope3_at_starpower_dot_net, not required but helpful
for planning purposes.

PS, 	Thom, please post to vintagebus. We'd love to have a split show up!
(But we will have the famous splittie cookies regardless.)

	Steve, post to type2, s.v.p.

Hope to see you there!

Tom Forhan and Michele Moriarty
