Subject: Filling that hole in the dash.

Not as bad as it sounds.  Someone had cut a VDO sized hole in the dash of my
67 bus long ago and didn't too bad of a job of it.  Since I can't run a Berg
temp dipstick with my T3 conversion (it runs WAAAAAAY too close to the belt
and pulley), I'm going to run a VDO sump plate guage.  2 years ago I
cabbaged onto a nice little set of various VDO guages in an older T4 wagon
and have been sitting on them for awhile.  I plucked out the VDO Oil temp
guage and hooked it to a new sensor using a battery I keep charged on the
bench.  I then took a lighter and held it on the sensor and sure enough, the
guage started moving.  As for accuracy, I have no idea but if anyone had any
good ideas for how to run the Berg dipstick sender on a T3 to T1 conversion,
let me know.  The dipstick convertor thing comes out too close to the crank
pulley and even though the tempstick guage goes in without hitting anything,
you can bet with a little vibration and air whipping around that it will rub
or get caught up in the belt.

I installed the guage, hooked up the wires, and the backlight seems to work
well with the rest of the dash lights.  I just have to run a wire back to
the engine bay and I'll be in business.

BTW:  My jets for the 40IDF's are on their way from Kymco and they should
arrive either tomorrow or Friday.  I'd sure like to get the engine test run
and ready to drive around since I only have 1 week left until the big trek
out to BNNTA.  I'm also going to attempt to hook up my empeg player so I can
have tunes on the way out but we'll see if I have time.  It sucks that I
have to work this weekend so right there is a major loss of time.
