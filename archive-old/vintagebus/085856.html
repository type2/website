the corner.  I like to use a 8 lb maul on a 3' handle.  Feel free to yell
while doing this.   It makes a dull thud when the shoes are stuck to the
drum, and a higher ring when the shoes brake loose.   Do this one side at
a time for safety's sake. :)  I trust you have a good jack. ( not the
&gt;  jack that came with the bus)   Using a jackstand as well is not a bad
idea.

A more subtle approach is to put a punch inside the drum through the
inspection hole and whack the web of the shoe sideways with a hammer.
This might break things loose with less drama.
