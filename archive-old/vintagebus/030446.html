Subject: VW Book Closeout at Waldenbooks

I was at Waldenbooks in the Clearview Mall, Harahan, Louisiana Thursday
night.  They had several copies of Terry Shuler's Volkswagen Then and
Now for sale at $5.95.  It's a nice coffee table book that originally
retailed for $29.95.  Lots of historic photos.  206 pages.  You might
want to check the Waldenbooks in your area to see if they are doing the
same.
