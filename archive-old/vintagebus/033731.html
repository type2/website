    Today I pulled my 60 DC into the shop to start working on it and to go
through all the parts that came with it(this is a bus VW Howard and I found
on our way back from KP). This is a late 1960 DC, it has wedges on the
hinges of the cargo door . It came with NOS Sigla glass (wrong year glass
but it's all NOS) pop-out, windscreen, back glass etc. It has the correct DC
pop out frames and latches for these also. All rubber to put back together ,
a new wiring harness and every nut,wing nut and bolt. The speedo shows
101,000 miles on it and it has had a big nut trans in it that looks to have
been there for a few thousand miles. Looking at the underneath of it up on
the hoist it is absolutely rust free, there's barely any surface rust. All
the body work has been nearly completed and at looking at  the bondo on it
(not that much really) it was put there to just straighten out panels with
the little road wear/parking lot dings that come with age. I usually don't
get to excited over a bus, but this one has me going. The window frames and
doors have already been painted and the window frames assembled (the PO sent
the window frames and wing vents to WW to be assembled) and are painted
VIPER RED so that's going to be it's color. The fun part is going to
accessorize it with all parts made by Creative Engineering,
http://www.creative-engineering_dot_com (of whom I am the  U S distributor for
now) to add a custom but clean touch to. So look for me at the shows, as
this WILL be a DRIVER and a head turner at that.
