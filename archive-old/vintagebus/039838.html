ok... this may be a dumb question...

do pressed bumpers fit later buses' brackets? i mean will the bolt holes ON 
THE BUMPER line up with the later bracket? if NOT, will pressed brackets 
line up with the holes on later buses' frames.

i guess what i am asking is, if i got a set of these, do i HAVE to buy new 
brackets? AND if i did get new brackets, will they bolt right up to my '66?

sorry for the confusion, i reread this 10 times
