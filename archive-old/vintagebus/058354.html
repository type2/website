One of the things you must remeber about the research that Gene did was that
it was all relative. The only synthetic oil on the market at the time was
Mobil One, and it did run hot in air cooled engines. That is specifically
why the FAA banned it from Lincolns and Lycoming aircraft engine use. We now
have many synthetic oils available that do meet the requirements of hot
aircooled engines. But alas, Gen's not here to see them.

The original thin wall 92 and 94mm cylinders were bad news. Nowadays we have
better quality and more choices. But again, Gene is not here to try them
out.

Everything is relative. Like you said, he contributed a lot to the VW
community using things available to him at the time and products he
developed himself when there wasn't anything to use in its place. 

As far as Gene goes, he wasn't God, but in his time he was the best we had.
Let's keep it in perspective, OK?

Gene Berg was a legend in his own mind.
He did a LOT for the VW scene, but there are things that he strongly
believed that are just not true (Synthetic oil makes your heads run hot,
chromoly headstuds dont work in daily drivers, 94mm P&amp;C's dont have any
dependability, if the product wasn't supplied by GBE, it wont last
sufficiently, etc, etc......) .  Don't believe everything that he put down
in his writings, take everything with a grain of salt.

But not to sound like i'm bashing Berg, he did a TON of stuff that helped
the VW hobby and I do appreciate that. So no flame wars please.....

&gt; Didnt know that. Gene Berg was THE god of Modifying VW engines and he
really
&gt; knew what he was talking about.
