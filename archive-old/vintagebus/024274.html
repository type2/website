Aren't cars FUN? 

&gt; Pull the line off the carb, my daughter confirms that gas does NOT come out
&gt; when I spin the engine. She's good help, very literal, doesn't try to get
&gt; ahead of me. 8) Pull the line from the tank to to the fuel pump, gas GUSHES
&gt; out, I shall stink for the next 36 hours. Golf tees, have to dig but they
&gt; are in the tool box.

What I use instead of golf tees is about 1-1/4&quot; of metal fuel line
crimped over on one end. Crimp with vice grips, then fold over. It seals
well and will seal forever (well, nearly so).

I've found another thing that keeps me from smelling like I use Old
Exxon after shave. They're some funky little clamps that I bought at a
swap meet... I don't know what they were for, maybe lab equipment, but
they looked too useful to pass up. 

They are about 1&quot; square with a rod threaded perpendicular through one
side. The rod has a knurled knob and advances a bar that runs parallel
to the side with the threaded hole. The opposite side acts as a gate,
pivoting on a screw at one end and slipping under another screw to
complete the square.

These things are great! You can open the gate, put the clamp around the
fuel line, close the gate, and screw the bar down to clamp off the line.
You then pull the fuel line off and leisurely find your golf tees, or
work with the clamp on. They don't destroy the fuel line like clamping
with mini-vice grips can, and it's easy to apply a little more pressure
to the clamp if you're still dripping.

Maybe someone on the list knows what they're really for and where you
can buy them (besides chance at the swap meet).

&gt; 
&gt; It's not that I want to be her hero, so much as this: I want her to see
&gt; that when something goes wrong, you figure out the problem and then you fix
&gt; it. If you have the part then you bolt it in, if not then there's no
&gt; disgrace in hiking for it. But know before you leave what can go wrong.
&gt; 
She probably worships you as a VW demi-god! There's certainly value in
teaching kids that they just need to be patient and logical when things
go awry instead of having a tantrum. And you salvaged enough time for
practice!
