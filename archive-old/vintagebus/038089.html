it looks like a mismatched pair, and I belive the one closest to the camera 
in the picture is correct for a 50s commercial vehicle.  but there are many 
varieties of wiper arms.   they are functionally interchangable from barndoor 
through 67.   Barndoor ones have real thin arms, but believe this was also 
used after barndoor for a while.  never tried to figure exactly when,   some 
years barndoor the passenger vehicles came with chrome arms and blades.  But 
are you looking for wiper arms, or CORRECT wiper arms?  those will both work 
on a bus.
