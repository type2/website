I have received several complaints/questions over the past few days 
regarding posting via e-groups, and rather than keep repeating myself offline,
I'm throwing it out here for the list populace.

Posting via E-groups is not &quot;officially&quot; supported on either the type2 or 
vintagebus lists.  Basically, the egroups &quot;list&quot; is a &quot;subscriber&quot; - meaning
that posts to vintagebus (or type2) are propogated to the e-groups list.
Likewise, the e-groups list is a subscriber to the vintagebus list, so
when you click &quot;post&quot; it is supposed to appear on our list.

Since e-groups is a wholly separate entity and we at type2_dot_com have
absolutely NO control or say over how stuff is done over there, there is
no way we can support it.  If they change their stuff, which they have
several times, it's tough noogies on us (ie me, Steve, Ken, et al.)

What it comes down to is this: if you want to post via e-groups, go ahead
and try.  If it works, bravo, if it doesn't, I'm sorry, but life is like
that.  If it's too much trouble for you to sign onto the list in order to
be able to post, like the other 2000 or so people, well, I don't know 
what to say.
