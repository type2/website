Subject: Re: [VB] More Porsche Pulley = 50F+!

hello Adrian  How ya doing well I hope   These numbers match what we have 
been seeing and seems to indicate that the porsche pulley is the way to go on the 
type 1 motors.  I also agree with your choice and size of belt. I havent put 
mine on the 59 panel test bus yet but will before the next swap I drive it to  
I'll post my results then  You coming to Buses on the River or Dixiebus??   
Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
