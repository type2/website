&gt; it is hard to tell what is going on...it seems like I have to turn the wheel

I havent experienced this problem but it sounds like a fundamental problem
of basic alignment or a bent component. The camber and toe-in adjustments
have never been too critical in my bus. I keep them spot on, but it
doesn't seem as if a slight misadjustment would cause your problems. My
bus's front end has spent some time in the past being very worn, and I
never had your symptoms.
