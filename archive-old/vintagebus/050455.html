Hi Doug,
Definitely sounds like a crudded up carb.  So clean it out the complete carb 
especially the accelerator passages and make sure to remove and reverse spray 
out the accelerator brass nozzle.  You may even need to use a strand of 
copper wire to clean out any stuck in gunk in the outlet tip of this noozle.
