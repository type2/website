Hey now
for those that didn't catch it yesterday, I had a broken heater cable and the 
whine from the passenger seat was getting too load to ignore. Thanks to all 
who replyed, boy are you guys either incredibly clever or incredibly cheap. ; 
) Found what I think is the cleanest way to fix a broken cable short of 
replacing it. Shop had a cable shortning clamp, normally used when you've got 
too long a throttle cable, but it lets you clamp securely to the cable alone, 
also has a solid nose so it fits well in your cable barrel. ah nothing like 
heat from both boxes.
BTW it looks like quite a few manufactors are dropping the cable from their 
books. At this rate with the unavailability of parts us bay guys can be as 
snobby as the split guys. lol
