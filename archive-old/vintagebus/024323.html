Subject: Distributor Drive Pinion

I'm about to install the distributor drive pinion on a new longblock.

The book goes to great lengths to say the athe engine must be lined up
with TDC
and that the slot on the drive pinion is in a very specific position.

Upon reflection, is it REALLY that important that the slot is lined up
exactly?
If its not lined up exactly (like off a few degrees) can't the
distributor merely be turned to
point at #1 to compensate?

Am I missing something?

Thanks,

...Markus
