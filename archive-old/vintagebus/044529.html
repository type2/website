I don't think an 8-track will fit in a '66 radio hole without serious

hackage. Too wide, you know. The Sapphire VIII in the '67 is different,

monstrous radio orifice you know. Better find you a nice vintage underdash

Kraco unit.

I was just talking w/ a friend and mentioned I had just found another car 8
track player so now I can trick out the 65 westy   :):):)   And if anyone
wants to trade tapes I have gots lots, and would love to find Black Sabbath
'Paranoid' in 8 track  and just have a butt rockin' kind of time.   Oh yeah,
friend said he had a few of them auto 8 tracks so I might be able to hook you
up, but it'd probably ot fit the radio hole.
