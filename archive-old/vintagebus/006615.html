When I met with reps from Robert Bentley publishing at the Classic I was
told that all Bentley manuals, including the VW and pre 64 ones are
currently being put on CD Rom and should be available in the near future
(but this was back in June) so keep your fingers crossed. Just think you'll
be able to print out the page you need so you won't get your OG copy greasy.
These are also supposed to have the parts number books in them also.

I haven't seen either an electronic bentley nor the taxonomy stuff.

I tried to get Alldata to do it when I worked there, but they told me
to &quot;stuff it&quot; in so many words.
