 I have 1964 Sundial that was converted to 12 volts by PO (still had 6 volt
 starter)  I just ordered a rebuilt transmission and am having it installed by
 a local guy who used to do VW work years ago.  Anyway he tells me the rebuilt
 trans is from a '67 Bug and he had to put in a 12 volt starter because the
old
 6 volt wouldnt fit in the trans properly.  OK my question:
 
 I would suppose it still had the 6 volt flywheel.  Problem, right?  He says
 no, he's done it many times without any trouble.  Then he says it looked like
 the flywheel was a 12 volt anyway.  Wait a minute,  LOOKED like a 12 volt
 flywheel? Doesn't this decide the clutch size too?  For the starter concern,
 he said that if it made me feel better, there was a bushing that allowed one
 to use a 6 volt starter with a later transmission.  OK great he'll put it in
 for me-but what about the flywheel-clutch thing?  Maybe PO was running a 6
 volt starter with a 12 volt flywheel?  No grinding or problems with starting
 prior to this though. Then I hear some buses used a 6 volt flywheel that was
 the same size as the 12 volt  HELP!
  &gt;&gt;

1) You should be able to use a 6V or 12V starter- the bushing in the tranny
may need to be changed, but a new bushing is cheap, and also a good thing.
(old bushings may be ovalised, making the starter grind, and are a pain to
change with the motor in).  With the motor out, it only takes a minute to
change the bushing.

2) 12V flywheels are slightly larger than 6V ones  (I have heard of a 12V one
the same size as 6V, but it is v rare)  Well, if you have a 6V tranny and a
larger flywheel, the tranny bell housing should be ground out (if not already
done).  But if it is from a 67 bug as you said, it can take a 12V flywheel.

23   The 6V or 12V designation on the FW is for the teeth (number-also size)
not clutch size)   If you have a 6V FW you must use a 6V starter.   If you
have a 12V system you can have a 12V solenoid on the 6V starter and all is
groovy.  If you put anon matching starter and FW together it will not fit
right, and will grind and destroy each other.   

4)The clutch must match the FW.   Most 6V FW take the smaller clutch, and most
12V FW the larger.   A Larger clutch is better, as you have more clutch.  If
your FW has the 180, and you want the 200, you must switch FWs.

5) so- you have a 12V bus with a 6V starter?   sounds like you have a 6V FW.
If you have a 6V starter it is there for a reason.  If you do have a small
diameter clutch on a 6V flywheel, and think of switching to a large diameter
clutch on a 12V FW, there is something elsto think about.   If you have a
stepped crank, you must run a stepped crank FW, or it will leak oil from the
main seal.   The FW has to be off the crank to see this, there is a step at
the end of the crank, and a step on the FW.   Non stepped FWs take a O ring,
and have a groove for the O ring.   You can use a stepped FW on your later
crank, but the step[ped crank wants the stepped FW.  Sounds like your mechanic
is confused, and/or lazy, which is not reassuring.    

The bottom line is:

the solenoid on the starter must match the Voltage of the battery, 
the teeth on the starter must match the teeth on the FW,
the bushing in the tranny must match the starter on the inside diameter and
the 
                                                            tranny on the
outside diameter,
 the clutch must match the clutch space on the FW, and
 if the crankshaft in the motor is stepped, you must have a stepped FW.

I hope I helped lessen the confusion.
