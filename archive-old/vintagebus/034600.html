&gt;  As I was cleaning it out, I had another chance (ugh) to peel back the 
&gt; floormat
&gt;  up front and peer at the nothingness beneath.  It seemed to me that my 
most 
&gt;  likey problem would be the floor that the gas pedal is attached to would
&gt;  fall off.  I'll have to be careful! 
..........Once I return from the trip, I _must_ rig something
&gt;  temporary so my gas pedal fear doesn't materialize.  My bus is my sole 
means
&gt;  of transportation, so it would suck to have the pedal fall out.
&gt;  
 it does suck.  it is what happens when the bus had safaris.   So I took  two 
pieces of metal, drilled suitable holes, and bolted through the floor holding 
the gas pedal hinge in place.   one piece above the floor, one below.  took 
some manueveriung, as there are some bits under the floor right there.  But  
no big deal to install that.  

ANyway, I did that to the 65 westy a year and a half ago,  and  until about 6 
months ago, it was my daily driver (when I was driving the 61).  SO it seems 
pretty functional.  But as the 61 is full of rust holes and drafty,  I am 
going to go buy tags for the 65 so I can drive it this winter.  Hm I don't 
need a truck,  it would be another VW to do maintenance on.   it would just 
be nice to borrow one now and then.
