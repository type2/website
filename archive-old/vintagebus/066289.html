Subject: Re: [VB] Restoring heat exchangers

I was thinking of acid dipping mine to get all the crud out of them.  Then 
welding up any holes and such to make them air tight to the max.  After that 
a good treatment of ceramic heat paint (expensive) and bake it to set it up.

Note that the center of the exchanger cannot be HPC coated because the heat 
will not radiate out anymore.. So HPC dipping them is no good.

Fun stuff :)

Later,
Adrian
