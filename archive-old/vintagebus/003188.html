Subject: Re: [VB] Barndoor Taillight Question??

&gt; I scored a couple of NOS Type 2 taillights:
&gt; http://www.geocities_dot_com/my65kombi/Barnlights.html?966725386070
&gt;  I'm not quite clear on the correct application. Am I right in assuming
&gt; that one is the North American edition, and the other is the European
&gt; edition????
&gt;
Barndoor?  No.
55 to mid-57?  Yes.

The one on the left is for non-semaphore Buses, it's dual filament.
The one on the right is for semaphore Buses, single filament.

People do sell the ones on the right as &quot;Barndoor&quot; as they technically could
be considered &quot;replacement&quot; lenses.  They are incorrect.
