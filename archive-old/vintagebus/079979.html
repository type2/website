Subject: 1964 Bus gearing question

In looking into a &quot;freeway flyer&quot; transmission for my leaking, noisy
original transmission, I have found conflicting information about what
ring and pinion ratio I have.

According to my Bentley, section H-1, page 2, the ratios are:
  Type 2/1200 and 1500 .... 4.125:1 .... number of teeth 33/8
  Type 2/1 Ton ............ 4.375:1 .... number of teeth 35/8
This seems to make sense; needing more engine RPMs to move a heavier
load. This would also mean that I would need a 3.88 R &amp; P to make a FF.

An old Clymer book agrees, stating the R &amp; P is 4.125 while making no
mention of 1 ton vehicles.

But, this web site, http://sandlizrd.baja_dot_com/gears.htm, using
information from Kennedy Engineering, states that the ratios are thus:
  '64 1 Ton     4.125
  '64 3/4 Ton   4.375 
This is opposite of the information above.

A transmission reseller told me that a 4.12 R &amp; P would be a FF for me.
If Bentley &amp; Clymer are correct, I would need a 3.88. If the other site
is right I can use a 4.125.

So, does my 1964 Standard, not a 1 Ton, have a 4.125 or a 4.375 R&amp;P?
Your help will be much appreciated.
