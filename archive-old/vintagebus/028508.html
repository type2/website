&lt;&lt; I'm about ready to put my engine back in, and I noticed that the area on 
the 
 transmission surrounding the fly wheel is a bit scuffed up along the left 
 side.  (picture)  http://www.mtcnet_dot_net/~mdaniel/bus/Trans.jpg
 It's like something was scraping against it.  Should I worry about this?
 Thanks as always,
  &gt;&gt;
no, don't worry, that scuffing wont matter.  Seems always to scuff a bit when 
installing/removing the engine anyway, you can see those FW teeth marks.  Bad 
dog, dont eat the tranny.  Looks nice and clean.  :)
