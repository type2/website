What little I know about this is that this may have been a Westfailure 
modification for the German army radio trucks. (I saw a picture of a mid 
'70's truck like this, don't know if they used splits for the same thing)

This is all from memory (not to be fully trusted)

trying to remember where I saw that pic..............

&gt;I was wondering if anyone has any information about the so-called

&gt;
&gt;This is a Single Cab where the toolchest door and the front 1/2 of a side 
&gt;gate were merged into a door that folded down, similar to the rear of an 
&gt;Ambulance Bus.  The front 1/2 of the bed was also cut out.
