Subject: Re: [VB] 6 Volts times 2 = 12v?

Jay,

Regarding battery switches and nifty electrical equipment to change 12v to 
110ac look at marine supply places.  Try boatus_dot_com or westmarine_dot_com and 
search their catalogs.  Also, there are more sophisticated places like 
Consumer Electronics (a marine electronic supply outlet) located in Wall or 
Alaire New Jersey.  They have a catalogue and may have a web site.  I will 
look at home tonight and see if I have any contact info for them.
