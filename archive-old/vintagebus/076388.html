Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Vent Wing Window Problem

Hi All,

I just received a message from Kris Heinicka in Florida...
He says &quot;Mark Rafferty built the press in the factory book and
used it to press in the vent windows on my Kombi.  He
might be interested in a little side income pressing
in windows.  Email him at Neato64_at_aol_dot_com&quot;



now you know as much as me!


David
