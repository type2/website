Subject: RE: [VB] Looking forVW tool numbers ?

That's me, the local manufacture list is done, thanks to Obsolute
Aircooled Doc project. I'm trying to do the vw100-599 ranges. I got a
whole bunch of tools, first is to identify mine, but I was thinking
picture and/or drawings on a website to make as complete a list as
possible for those without the books.
Thanks for help on the 256a!

Was someone trying to compile a list of VW special tools? I found my
book
that has hundreds of tools listed and also pictures.
