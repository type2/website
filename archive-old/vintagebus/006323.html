Hey!

Ever had a bug-splattered windshield?  Well, after the large, yellow
slime-filled flying creature became a quickly-drying, super-adhesive type
smear on my windshield on the way to work yesterday, I got meself an idea
for someone with graphics skills to take if they want:

    Tiny VW bugs on colored, semi-transparent sticker media, that look like
the've been squished by windshield impact.  There would have to be several
colors/sizes/styles (for realism, y'know) and would be a great replacement
for those fake bullet hole stickers!  Also, the same graphics could be used
in a screen-saver! (little dots from infinity becoming gushed bug-splats)
Whadd'ya think?

    Meanwhile, (bus content) I long to get back to converting my 66 Kombi
(Mathilde) into smaller pieces.  Only a week and a half of this
life-consuming recording session to go, and then I'll have money, and
hopefully, time.  The sneaking evil rust cannot hide from me now!  Thanks to
the vintagebus list, I now have many weapons with which to extend the life
of my bus another 30 years!  Have at you, rust!

Later, Gene
