I too have been at a swap and seen a person carted away for selling hot
parts.  Made me stop and ponder the dubious origin of some of those
rarest of the rare, as well as the most mundane bumper bracket.  How
many times have you seen someone selling parts and thought that you
could build a bus out of what this chap has strewn about?  Every
conceivably unbolt able part is there....funny thing is all the over
spray on the parts is the same shade of blue....hmmmm?

Lock um up and throw away the key...huh?  Well, that means that most
likely all of us that buy parts should be cooling there heels in the
slammer.  I'm not condoning the trade in stolen parts mind you, just
pointing out the obvious!   All those great deals we all think we
&quot;scored&quot; most likely have a tainted history.

I agree that any thief should be burned at the stake!  Anyone that
knowingly buys those stolen items should be right there too. I'll be
there with the match.  Just let us all ponder our own involvement in the
circle of (parts) life.   20 dog house coolers and adapters  for 20
bucks....hmmmm.  Great score, good thing they weren't stolen!
