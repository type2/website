&lt;&lt; I know it is in need of a front end alignment, but wherever I go they tell 
me that they can't do cars this old. I went to a VW dealer and they said that 
no adjustments could be made, but the Bently manual says otherwise.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
First check all your tie rods, center pin, and steering box and it's linkage 
for wear and tear resulting in slop.  If that does not do the trick then 
remove/dissassemble your link pins to inspect for wear, clean and regrease.  
While there check out your king pins for wear.  Then when you reassemble 
everything in good condition you can follow the instructions on front end 
alignment in the &quot;Idiot's manual&quot; by John Muir.  If you still have wandering 
steering problems then it probably is due to low quality soft side wall tires.

&lt;&lt;Another problem that my Bus has is that it list to one side,actually the 
rear left corner. What could be causing this? The car has new shocks and the 
tires are filled.&gt;&gt;
Sounds like your left rear torsion bar has sagged over time.  If so you will 
have to reset the swing plate on that side a notch or two.
