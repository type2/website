&gt; Thicker , heavier oil is not better in an oil cooled, and air cooled

oil

Even SAE 50 oil gets pretty thin when hot.  The table in my Bentley
says that SAE 20 oil may be used for ambient temperatures between 15F
and 50F.  Where I live (SoCal), we haven't been down to 50F on the
thermometer since April.

OTOH, the manual says that SAE 20W50 oil is good from 15F to 100F+. 
This covers just about all of my normal driving environments
year-round, unless I decide to take a trip to the snow country in
winter.

Oils that are too thin will fail to maintain an adequate lubricating
film on the working surfaces of the engine.  This will occur whether
the engine is air-, oil-, or water-cooled.
