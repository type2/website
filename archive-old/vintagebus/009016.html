Subject: [VB] Fired up the engine for the 66 bus tonight.

Well tonight it happened - I fired up the 1600 T3 engine that I converted
over to an upright T1 setup.  It runs but there are quite a few problems.

First off, the engine is a used bottom end.  I knew I was taking a risk by
taking the word of the guy who sold it to me but the price was cheap and his
reputation in town is upstanding (auto shop teacher.)  The heads were
supposedly redone 1,000 miles ago and the new pushrod tubes and condition of
the heads upon removal lead me to believe it was true.

The end play is within spec so everything is kosher there.

So here's the deal - I built a skid out of 2x4's and 4x4's and wired the
engine down to it.  Then I rigged up a light to monitor oil pressure.  I've
got oil pressure and the full flow system is working really well.  I only
have a leak from the valve cover on the 3 &amp; 4 side and a small one from the
OP sender which loctite or jbweld is going to have to fix.  I kept shooting
starting fluid in the engine and cranking it over.  The allowed me to prime
the system within 3 starts.  The 4th time it ran.

The carbs have that good old dual carb sound and the engine sounds mean.

I preset the 40 IDF's Webers to what the Weber tech book suggests.  The
adjustment screws start at 3 turns out and the little stud with the locknut
at 1/2 turn out.

As the engine is running, from the 3 &amp; 4 side I hear the sound of a
non-firing cylinder.  Removing the #4 plug changes nothing.  So I did a
compression check (should have done it before.)  Here's the results:

#1- 80psi
#2- 70psi
#3 - 90psi
#4 - 120psi

I don't believe these readings at all.  The cylinder that I was having
problems with has the best reading so I suspect that something is wrong with
my guage or at least the seal.  I had it tightened as snug as I could get it
though.  After all, the engine does run with no bucking or kicking and if
those cylinders were really that low, the engine shouldn't run or at least
run really really rough.

I can rev the engine up and when returning to idle, it just kind of
maintains a high idle that slowly creeps back down.  If I put the uni-sync
over one of the bbl.'s, the engine immediately drops to a low idle and then
almost sputters out and dies.  It does this on every cylinder and especially
number 3.  I also have an occasional backfire and a little flame shoot out
of the intake on whatever bbl.
Also, the #4 cylinder, when I shot a little starting fluid in it while the
engine was running, seems to fire so I'm wondering if I don't have a plugged
jet in the carb.

Over all, I'm a little disappointed but I can't expect everything to work
fine on the first try.  I'll stick things out for a few days but I must
admit, I didn't realize that dual carbs can be overwheming and a pita.  It
drastically increases the variables in why an engine won't run.  At least
with a single carb setup, if you have a cylinder that misses, you know
immediately it's either spark or compression because the other 3 are running
fine.

If anyone can help me out or make some suggestions, I'm all open for them.
I need all the help I can get as I've never messed with dual carbs before.
Thanks!

BTW:  These 40IDF's came from Peter Davy and he told me that they were
jetted for a stock engine.  I also am running ratio rockers (1.25's)
