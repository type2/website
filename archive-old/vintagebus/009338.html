I just heard on the news that several models of Firestone &quot;SUV&quot; tires are
being recalled and pulled off the market due to numerous accidents [some
fatal] caused by catastrophic tread separation at speed.  I didn't catch any
tire model names or sizes, but they specifically mentioned models and sizes
fitted to SUVs.

Might be worth checking out .....

&gt;&gt;  This is still a 4 ply tire but Firestone calls it an SUV tire because it
has reinforced sideways to prevent sway  &lt;&lt;
