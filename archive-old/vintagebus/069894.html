Subject: tarp size

Hello Everyone,

Well, this evening is community school autobody class at the local high 
school, I've been a regular there every thursday night (except during summer 
breaks) since January 2000.  Every week I tow the bus into their shop to 
work on it, and tonight I'll use the paint booth to put on one last coat of 
epoxy primer to seal up a few places where I've sanded through to bare 
metal, then three coats of high build primer which I will sand down with 400 
this weekend.  Then Paint!

Problem is, it's snowing outside.  Roads will be wet and yucky tonight, and 
I'm towing a bus that has exposed metal through it.  The ideal solution 
would be not to go, but dammit, i've come this far I can't stop now.  
Besides, if I'm going to get paint on it before class ends in may, I can't 
miss a week due to weather.

Bus is currently inside my garage (wooden garage with concrete floor) and 
safe from the elements.  I've just got to get it to school (about 2.5 miles) 
and throw some primer on it.  My thought is to get a big blue tarp and wrap 
it over the bus to prevent road grime (we salt our roads here too :-( just 
until I get it to the shop.  Remove tarp and prime, then going home should 
not be a problem since any exposed metal will be covered at that point.  For 
those that may have done it, what size of tarp would I need?  I don't want 
to get one that is too big so that it's flowing behind like a parade float 
(I can just imagine it now...)

Or have i been sanding glazing putty in an enclosed space too long?  Just 
drive it, weather be damned, towel it off at the shop and shoot the primer?  
Primer is self etching epoxy with zinc (PPG DP50LF). What do y'all think?

Thanks,

Mike A.
