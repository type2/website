Subject: Re: [VB] Are they still available?

Welcome to the list. You should get plenty of opinions here, so I guess I'll go first. Restored means &quot;back to stock&quot;.
I'm sure that someone makes adapters but I'm wondering if that would even work to begin with. Have you measured the well to see if you can even get a tire that big in there?  I run 205/75/15 and have little clearance at the doglegs so I can't imagine running a 18&quot; tire.
