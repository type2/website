 there a mid sized one for that style shifter or is it the same as the later

 Hi Doug,
 We can only find one shifter holder in the parts books for bus.
 211 711 105  Ball housing - Gearshift lever.
 This compared to four front gearshift rods, and three gearshift levers used 
 up to 1968 model year.

right - Thats the part the gear shift lever goes through in the cab and holds 
the spring and all in it.  you know I am having a little trouble picturing 
what parts are the problem.  And am  wondering did this shift before or did 
Doug get the bus this way.  One thing I have found is that the piece that the 
two bolts fromt the top screw into, the piece that has a circle for the shift 
rod, it's called

p/n 111 701 255B Guide- gearshift rod up to ch # 216 028 111

it can be rusted through.  Also, if the bus had bad tranny mounts, this can 
have everything flopping around in there and break this part (as well as the 
nose cone of the tranny, dissipate the seal in the nosecone of the tranny 
which helps extrude oil from the transmission, reducing its useful life,  and 
also bend the hockey stick in extreme cases)  

when I got my westy, the ball would not stay in the socket, and upon 
examination it was revealed that this was because of this part being rusted 
through in the ring.
