I was wondering if anyone has any information about the so-called &quot;side-loader&quot; Single Cab.

This is a Single Cab where the toolchest door and the front 1/2 of a side gate were merged into a door that folded down, similar to the rear of an Ambulance Bus.  The front 1/2 of the bed was also cut out.

I've heard this was not a factory conversion.

Pictures are welcome!

Thank you,
Everett Barnes
