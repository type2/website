Subject: Westy Roof rack

Hi

If the ladder attachment bar is attached to two of the hoops and slightly
lower then the last wood strip, it's supposed to be there. The other clue is
with the ladder attached, the mid section ladder support should rest on the
belt line, and the ladder bottom on the top of the rear tire. Have a picture
of the bar somewhere if you need it.

A lot of people have ladders but usually attach them to the top aluminum
bar, have them resting against a side window and the bottom part of the rear
sheet metal. Asking for paint and glass disaster...

I used oak on my westy rack resto although I have heard ash was originally
used as well...
