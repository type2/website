I thought I'd make everyone feel better about their mechanical abilities by
sharing my joyous day with my bus... (that was sarcasm).

Lately, the bus had been choking and gagging anytime I'd try to accelerate.
It'd idle fine, but as soon as I would accelerate, it would sputter and die.
My first thought was water or crud in the carb.  So I pulled the carb, gave
it a thorough cleaning and out it back on.  I then replaced the fuel filter
for good measure.  Started her up gave her a few revs and everything sounded
good.  Time for bed.  Got up the next morning, took off down the road, and
within a 1/4 mile of home, it started gagging again.  I limped it home and
scratched my head for a while.

I got to thinking that maybe there was crud in the tank.  The engine was
rebuilt by a very able mechanic 5K miles ago, and I've had no trouble with
it, but a few weeks ago I pulled it out of my Ghia and put it in the bus.
So the only difference would be the gas tank.  That meant it was engine-pull
time again...  Yee haa!

On the ghia, I never had too much trouble reaching the mounting bolt that's
right behind the clutch arm, I could usually get on it with a swivel and
extension on a ratchet.  Not so on the bus, as the clutch arm is directly
behind the bolt.  I'd already had the engine in and out of the bus twice,
and tightening this bolt took as much time as the rest of the procedure.

So off I dash, thinking that a ratcheting end wrench is just what I need.  I
KNEW that end wrench would save the day.  It was gonna be worth whatever
they were asking for it, be it $5 or $50, cuz it was gonna change my life!

Well, this fine tool (which was $8) is now somewhere in the woods buried
under leaves and brush.  And I hope it has a fine life there, rusting and
corroding.  It didn't save the day and I ended up using a plain old end
wrench and busting my knuckles.

The good news is that I got the engine out, removed the gas tank and
immediately saw what the problem was...  The fuel line had gotten so old and
soft that it was kinking where it leaves the bottom of the tank.  I didn't
have to pull the engine at all!  That really made my day.  It was kind of
bitter sweet, because the fix was simple, but I'd done so much unnecessary
work...  Oh well, next time I pull an engine it'll be a little easier.

Oh yeah, does anyone have any good tricks for removing that bolt?

Keep on wrenchin'
