Subject: Early Westy hatches
Message-Id: &lt;199903171756.JAA19644_at_web1_dot_calweb_dot_com&gt;

I recently found out something interesting about early westies: somewhere
in the mid to late 50's, the  hatch size and style changed.  I recently
aquired an early 60's hatch from a friend; I was stoked, as it was in
nice shape.  But it doesn't fit!  The hinges match up perfectly, but
the hatch is 1/2&quot; or so too small all the way around.

Also, my original hatch does not have an inner reinforcing metal frame;
it was all wood. Also, the wood on my hatch is attached with 
fasteners going thru the metal; the later ones have no intrustions.
My hinges have bolts that hold them to the hatch; the later ones don't
have anything going thru the hinge, so it's either a stud or a rivet on
the inside.
