Subject: Needs help in Albuquerque NM area.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Volks,
We have a friend in Albuquerque area who is having brake problems with her DD 
59 Panel.  Due to being to far away in the Seattle area is hindering us 
helping her.  So is there anyone in her area who could assist her to figure 
out the brake problem and oversee work she does on it.  She is able to do her 
own tune ups and engine diagnoses, but this brake problem is really getting 
to her and has started her to think about buying a replacement used car which 
she really can not afford and who knows what she will end up with!    Thanks, 
 Eric&amp;Barb
