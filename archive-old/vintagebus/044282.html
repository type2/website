&lt;&lt; [VB] Flotter Transporters for sale
 
 I want to know what the value of these are as I have an opportunity to buy
 ~20 of them.  They are all of early 60s vintage.  I remember seeing them for
 $20/each but cannot remember. &gt;&gt;

Everett,
Sorry I can't help you on a value.  My question is What in the world is a 
Flotter Transporter?  For $20 I might buy one just to see what it is.
