I used some felt with sticky stuff on the back that I found at the
hardware store. It was cheap and the package had enough in it to redo
the job several times if it needs it. It still hasn't at almost two
years.

I was a little worried about the felt holding water against the rain
gutter, but I haven't seen any problems yet.
