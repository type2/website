&gt;Dave,
&gt;   I'm not seeing a price list on the dunn right page.  How much did that
kit run and I want to &gt;see some pictures man.  That is totally cool.  I
gotta build one.

Here's the deal- It's strictly Mom &amp;Pop.
Make a call to the designer, Larry-
and also speak with his boss ( wife: ) Pam
in Anderson, SC # 864-296-1636 and be sure
to mention that Dave Wolfanger sent you !!
