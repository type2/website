Subject: Re: [VB] accel. cable cut tranny case

yes, definately slide some fuel line over it.  If you replace the fuel line 
from the tank to the motor, the old stuff if a good length for the gas line.  
 Either that, or use a bowden tube.  I am not sure  that the splitties came 
with bowden tubes, but you can use one off a bug and it makes the gas pedal 
firmer.

 i notice when i pulled my engine that my accelerator cable is slowly slicing
 through the tranny case. has anyone else ever had this happen? any
 suggestions of remedies...i was thinking of sliding some fuel line over it,
 but i dont know it that will jam up or maybe not last very long. the slice
 in the tranny is pretty bad, at least 1/8&quot;.
