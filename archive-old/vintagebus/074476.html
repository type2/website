&gt; Here's what *would* happen:

Hi Taylor,
Sounds like a bad ground to us to!  Build a ground wire harness and ground 
them directly to the battery ground strap where it bolts to the body.  Then 
clean the front turn signals to the body connections up and using vasalene or a 
dielectric grease to help prevent future corrosion!
