Well,  after 12+ months, it feels good to finally get the last coat of
paint on.  It also feels good to put something together for a change.
It is kind of nice to take all the small pieces and make one big one
again.  (I just have to remember how it all goes together.)

What i put together were 2 of my pop out windows.  Doing this raised a
question.  Where is the Sekirt (SP?)(Small logo) logo suposed to go and
on which side? (Inside or outside)  My bus has 6 pop outs.   I am
probably being way too anal here, but if you going to do it, mite as
well do it right.  Anyone have either some good original pictures, a
original bus or maybe just the answer for me?

My thought is that VW assembled these all the same (as far as Logo
orintation) and let them fall were ever they fall.  Seams like the bus's
i have seen have the logo on the rear top corner of the frame.  I have
seen the logo both inside and outside.  Any official info out there?

a very good question.   funny you should say that.  Yes, you are being anal,
but thats not a bad thing.    what I have seen on buses where the windows
have stayed put is that the logos are on the top, towards the rear.  This
means if you take a pop out from the left side of the bus and put it on the
other side, the logo will be in the wrong place.  Perhaps you noticed this on
my 61 when it was at Kelley Park, as I replaced the popouts (originals were
rusted) with nice ones one of a junkyard, and put them on the wrong side as
the seals were better that way.

 If you are standing on the left side of the bus, the logo should be in the
top right corner, if you are on the right side, the logo should be in the top
left corner.     I think this means that on one side the logo is on the
outside and on the other side the logo is on the inside.   (say that ten
times fast)
