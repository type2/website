Subject: [Friday] Dash decorations

Hey Volks

All my driving buses seem to have a propensity to attract odds and ends to
gather on the dash by way of decoration. Since it's Friday here and we
haven't had a list
questionnaire for a while, here goes:

What do you have decorating your dash?

My 63 Dormobile has the following knicknacks collected on our travels:
* Several kinds of everlasting wild flowers stuck through the speaker
grille;
* Some &quot;flowers&quot; made from wire and old beverage cans;
* Some interesting feathers: guinea fowl, francolin, etc;
* A couple of porcupine quills;
* A couple of interesting stones;
* A Nelson Mandela inauguration R5 coin;
* A piece of sea-worn driftwood that looks like a snake;
* A micromachines split bus pulling a wheelie;
* Matchbox #34, &quot;VW Caravette&quot;;
* Modern radio/tape hacked into radio space (DPO!)

The Zebra bus is basically more of the same, but with the addition of:
* Oil temp gauge
* Radio blanking plate!

So what do you guys all have decorating/cluttering up your dash?
