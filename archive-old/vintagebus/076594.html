Subject: Re: [VB]slider deluxes /was front seat area? 

it probably is original then. and as clara suggested, if it was rusty enough
to have engine bay metal removed thats probably where the pans went to.  it
just seemed suspicious to me because those are the two most common indicators.
missing pans, and the removal or mismatch of the vin's. my engine bay numbers
won't show in a photo thanks to a po painting part of the engine bay black
with some brush on paint, otherwise i'd send you a photo. but if you can't
find it just looking, it's probably not there.  it's stamped in the bus right
at the forward lip of the rear apron on the right hand side.

the link didn't work for me.

  I bought the van in primer. No head liner no suggested interior panels.
There were no signs of a sunroof being let in.The steering column has the
holes for the steering ignition lock. The rear of the bus has the hole for the
ducting for a Eberspacher also the cab has the switches and bowden cable for a
Eberspacher. The gearbox is replaced and is currently a garden orniment I am
not certain what the gearbox code should be for a LSD box but then it might
have been replaced before. There has been some metal replaced in the engine
bay this bus was a German bus I.E. no port of import stamp. This was a rusty
bus I think that the vin number might have been plated over when this area was
worked on. I Have done a quick search on The Samba to find a photo of a vin
number stamped into a engine bay. Clara can you help? TIA Mike
