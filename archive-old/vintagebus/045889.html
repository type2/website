I am told if you reach behind and unplug the wire on your sending unit and

and it immediately goes to full the gauge is ok and the sending unit is shot.
If you here of a way to change the sending unit without removing the engine
please let me know as mine is toast.

this works to some extent.  (it is the brown wire that plus to the sender-
ground which is grounds dependent on the level of gas in tank- so if you
ground it manually it should read full)  However, I have found guages that
will do this said still not work.   However, if it does no flip across when
you ground the wire, it it toast, and should be replaced (much easier than the
sender).

I had replaced the 12V guage in my  6V truck (worked, but had problems) with a
6V guage (worked) which I replaced yesterday  with a optional pre 62 guage
(different face- fits with pre 62 VW) after Chris cut a hole in the dash with
a circle bit where some DPO had cut a hole and some DPO had welded it up
REALLY badly (u g l y- warped, paint burnt off around and rusted) so it looks
better now.  I generally do not like the idea of cutting into a VW, but in
this one it would have had to be done to fix it in any case)   

Anyway, if the guage is good and the sender bad, it is better to pull the
motor and tank to do this.     You probably have delayed maintenance that can
also be taken care off with the motor out- such as...

new gas line installation (important fire prevention)
easier acess to replace trans boots, rear brakes hoses, bleed rear brakes,
drain and refill trans
install thermostat if appliable
replace old main and oil cooler seals
switch to doghouse cooler?
are your heater boxes leaking- switch them
clutch good? 
re set cran end play

some people may suggest cutting a hole, but fumes in the inside of the bus is
not good, and having the engine compartment sealed off from the inside of the
bus is good.    That dicussion is in archives.   Please be nice, folks.
