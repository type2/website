Subject: Oil System Upgrades

I've been thinking of upgrading the oil system of our '67 and am looking
for comments.  I'm thinking of adding a sump, then upgrading to the
doghouse setup from pieces I'm gathering from the local junkyard. Good
hunting so far - shroud, front tin, cooler, new fan/adapter/seals for
$60. Next, I want to add the cover plate to the oil pump that allows a
remote oil filter/cooler. I'll mount a filter next to the left wheel
well. In the oil filter line I can add a second cooler. I was thinking
of making a new cover for the doghouse cooler to allow the airflow to be
routed to a 3&quot; duct hose instead of thru the front engine tin. Connect
the hose to the lid of a box (plastic battery box?) mounted behind the
left wheel well opposite the battery.  Inside the box is a Borg Warner
flat plate cooler with a seal around the cooler.  A hole would be cut in
the bottom of the box and in the tray below the box allowing air to exit
the box behind the left wheel. With a 1 1/2 qt sump this should bring
the oil capacity up to 5 qts. Even though the air for the second cooler
is preheated it should still provide some cooling.  The second cooler is
a factory '80 Ford van option with 1/2&quot; pipe fittings/48 plate and only
$10 at the local junkyard. I'll be watching the oil temps with a new
gauge to see what each step does to the temps -
sump,doghouse,filter,second cooler.
