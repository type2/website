&lt;&lt; Has anybody used this stuff?  How do you like it for using after media
 blasting and before painting?

I use it about 6 to 7 times a week.  The stuff we use is made by 3M.  We
mainly use it for joints in replacement panels and as long as you put it on
bare metal, I don't really think it matter how you get your metal bare...as
long as it's clean.  Weld Thu primer is not a replacement for primer!  It is
used in between join panels, after the panels are joined they get primed with
epoxy primer.
