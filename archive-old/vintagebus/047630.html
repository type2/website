re math for rpms at speed, I dont have it handy (it's in my dead computer who 
is in colour, have been in black and white for about 3 weeks, no seeing 
website or pics on this screen) but the guy had sent an email with his bus 
tached out, and the ratios were just like in my 59 truck with little nuts- 
which I believe had the 4.37 from the taching.    I got about 45mph at 3K, 
and in 4th it was about 1 mph per 100 rpms, which would give about 4500 at 
60.     I dont have the numbers anymore , as they went with the truck.   It 
would whine like all get out at 60 (by speedo, I had 14&quot; rims on it doubt if 
that was real speed, probably higher than real), so I did not drive 60.   
could have put a &quot;0 to 60 - NOT&quot; sticker on it.   nice 40hp motor.   plenty 
power to pull hills at 50mph in 4th.   28mpg.  cheap to run.  

in my 53 barndoor owners manual top /cruising speed they say is 48mph and 
that is 3700 rpms.   16&quot; rims of course.   so drop that to 14s,   and though 
the RGearing is slightly lower (1.40 rather than 1.39), the r/p is slightly 
higher, think it about evens out.    um- could find the numbers and put it 
through the formula and se if it gets the same as the owners manual does.   
confused yet?  me too.     never tached it though.  I am very sure it has the 
original gearing.  though possibly the left RGbox has been opened.

  I dont really understand the math, and also speedos can be slightly off esp 
if the tires are not exactly stock size.   I had tached my 61 (big nuts, 
15&quot;rims, 205 75 15 tires) and of course at the time did not know the r/p as 
it is not visible in a driving bus.     I say impossible to know from 
outside, cannot assume is original to year in there, also that was not the 
original  trans, but a $35 swap meet score.   only can know r/p  w/o looking 
in side if a split case which has one choice.

that 61 did 58 by speedo at 3K in 4th (52 real mph).  which surprised Eric, 
who of course is known for  warning against overrevving.  Said I was the only 
person he had met who had found 3K w/o a tach - as I had told him before it 
liked just under 60 as cruising speed.   (okay I'm bragging a bit)  Later the 
tranny made noises and got funky to shift and I extracted it, removed the 
RGBs (finding an axle shaft with the circlip ridge for the upper outer 
bearing gone, and that bearing thrashing around), and pulled a side cover to 
see the ring gear and count teeth.  It had a 4.37 r/p, which surprised me and 
defies the math.  What does this mean?  that  I agree w/Eric that you really 
need to tach  it to see what speeds at what rpms your bus does.   especially 
if you dont know what is in there, as you cannot see inside the center 
section.   Dif people have dif idea about what is good for cruising rpms, and 
cooling (though people with temp guages do seem to agree that cooling is 
better at 3K than 4K)

the difference between theory and practice is that in theory there is no 
difference but in practice there is.

okay, I'll stop blabbing about gearing now.
