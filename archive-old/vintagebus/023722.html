Subject: re bus people &amp; events

The main purpose of a BUS CLUB or any club for that matter is to help
you to increase your enjoyment out of your hobby. my wife ,&quot; magoo&quot;and i
have been doing vw for 20 years, longer than some and shorter than some,
many changes have come to pass, some good some bad, but such is life.
let us stay focused on the bus hobby to make it better! not more
confusing!! participate at all bus events, if you do not like the event,
than just do not go--thus thru poor attendance it will improve or go
away.--but let all of us not slam any vw event over cyber-space!! it's
not cool--if you have a beef, speak directly to the promotor--and
perhaps ask to help. trust me, in the number of events i have
promoted-worked-participated-every one could have had something go
better--but such is life--and all we can do is strive to improve our
image--no doubt in my mind bus people are unto themselves, as a bus
person in the vw hobby--i know and can see bus people are differant that
vw people--life in the slow lane is in a differant groove--my 40hp
hearse with some extra 600 #s added with the black box over the
single-cab body is not a rocket!! downhill though it does move out!! yet
as slow as&quot;drakula&quot; is i can appreciate the 25hp and 36 hp cross country
ballistic missiles that i know my bus friends are driving!
how they do it amazes me--then you have the free-way flyers-with big
motors and differant gearing--the camper crowd with 3 bus loads in and
ontop of one bus!!--the bus people who live in their bus!!and i am proud
of the fact that thru the bus hobby i was able to meet these vwonderfull
volks. let us all improve the bus hobby by helping when-ever we can--as
a sometimes promotor--and the fact i know a lot of promotors--and help a
lot of promotors---buses is where i want to be--it cannot always work
out the way we want it--though it be right or wrong--all we can do is
spread the word that vw bus people are most unique and are some of the
friendliest and most helpfull vw people to have as friends--uncle jerry
