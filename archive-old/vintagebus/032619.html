i strongly disagree!  i have and have used one of those
bolts-to-lug-nut-hole pullers for years.  the problem you experienced is
two-fold.  one-you should really have 5 arms, although 3 works fine. 
second--you can't use stock bus-length lug bolts.  they only thread about
2-3 threads into the drum, since the puller adds more distance for the bolt
to cover. i did this ONCE and, yes, i stripped a (junk) drum.   the
solution is to get lug bolts that are LONGER, like porsche 924 or some vw
alloy rims.  they thread fully in and a little extra, too. haven't stripped
one since.of course, if the drums have fused themselves to the axle, you
may have to torch it off.  put some grease on the splines before putting
the drum back on.  this helps alot for future removal.

&gt; rent a drum puller (Do not use the type that only 
&gt;  bolts to three of the lug nuts!  Best is one that hooks the drum edge.) 
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I'll second that!!!!  I used one of those puller that bolt on to three
lug 
&gt; nuts and it stripped out the threads in the drum.
