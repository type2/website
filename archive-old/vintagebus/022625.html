&gt;I would have to say that this bus is a scam (no offense).  It's pretty
&gt;thrashed, and it's missing a lot of parts.  In the description it even
&gt;says that the owner would sell most of the parts that it needs separately
&gt;(what a coincidence, huh?).  In the pictures it doesn't even look like it
&gt;has an engine.  Sorry if this turned into a rant.  In other words, no I
&gt;don't think that would be worth 1750.  But what do I know, I'm just a kid.

I'd say you know exactly what you're talking about!  That thing is a
hooptie, IMHO.  Saveable, yes.  $1750?  No way.
