&lt;&lt; And Hoover proclaimed long about this L shaped deflector bracket for the 
 doghouse cooler , and how the  L shaped deflector bracket for the doghouse

I've never seen one, I thought the hoover bit was the piece of tin out the 
rear of the fan housing. are they used instead of or in addition to the foam 
seal? It bolts right to the cooler?
