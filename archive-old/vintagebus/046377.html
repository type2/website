&lt;&lt; When I go to install my 1998 Mexican longblock into my '63 Truck, I should
 remove the pressed-in nut from the case and revert to the washer and bolt?&gt;&gt;
Hi Stephen,
Well it more matters which of the clutch arms that the rear end of the clutch
cable goes through that you have.  If you have one of the straight clutch arms
and when looking from the engine compartment forward the end of the boden tube
is pointed straight at the hole in the arm like a rifle.  Then all is well for
keeping the pressed-in nut.  If the end of the boden tude is pointing away
from the arm a little then you are going to have to figure out which of the
arms you need with the tranny side plate you have.  Unles you are willing to
remove the tranny and have the proper side plate installed or just replace the
clutch cable and boden tube often.  
 
 &lt;&lt;I liked the pressed in nut, a lot easier to install the bolt not having to
 hold both ends at the same time (somehow being under engine and behind bus
 at the same time). :)  &gt;&gt;
It is a neat idea.  Though working in the same area to adjust the clutch is
hard enough.  The VWs has a starter bolt that mounted both the starter and
engine at the same time.  With the later 12 volt starters this bolt had a &quot;D&quot;
shaped head that locked with the starter to prevent it from turning.  Since we
have earlier VWs and use the 6 volt starters we have welded a square tab to
this starter/engine bolt head to prevent turning.  A simular tab can be made
on the left upper engine mounting bolt, but instead of the tab just welded to
the side of the bolt head.  This tab should curve toward the rear so it locks
against the tranny bell housing to prevent rotation.
