No bashing is required if all the hardware is original.
The latches the aftermarket companies use are post-55 beetle latches which 
dont fit correctly.
If you have original latches and dashtabs expect it to pass with flying 
colors.
remember you need the EARLY flat dash tabs! ;-)
The repop ones are dished to match the dished latches.
I had more problems with the C.E. safaris then with the old hideous repops 
out here in california.

hi thom,

So you are saying that its neccecary (or probably needed??) to dent up the
dash and the windowframe to get safaris to fit on a pre 63 bus?

I was operating under the impression that if you take safaris out, you
just fill a few holes and all is back to normal, is this way off?

Dunno if i'd put em in if i knew it would require bashing my poor bus's
nice straight sheetmetal...

thanks,
