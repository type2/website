P &amp; C writ:
&gt;Where are you for $5 15 in wheels?&lt;

I am in Atlanta Georgia and the junkyard I go to has a few 15&quot; still left...
Mostly on the buses now, so it might be a bear to break the lug nuts off.
They have loads of 14&quot; wheels though.  The guy does not care what size the
wheels are at long as he gets $5.

There is a another junkyard in town that has a couple 15&quot;s for $10-$15
depending on condition, but that is too pricey for me :)

I run 14&quot; so I do not mess with the 15&quot; much. I have one 15&quot; that I am
saving for a spare if I ever get a set of 15&quot; aluminum wheels one day like
5-spokes or BRMs.
