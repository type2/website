Hi Ken,
It kind of depends on what your bus is for.  Is it going to be a trailer
queen, or hanger queen, and need every original part that came on it?  Or a
daily driver?  If the former then the Metal resevoir is correct and the
plastic will work, but is not original.  We have just finished an article for
the list library on installing a dual circuit 1971 &amp; later bus master
cylinder in pre-1968 buses.  The price for all of the parts for this
conversion including a new brazilian MC is about $50.00.  Check it out!
