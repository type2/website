Steven (and the List)

Valve stem height is extremely important in determining the volumentric
efficiency of your engine.  A change in valve stem height alters your valve
timing, changing both duration and lift.  

Having some valve stems at different heights results in volumetric imbalance
which in turn leads to unequal power pulses and a marked reduction in engine
performance and efficiency.    

With regard to automotive mechanics, with cam-actuated poppet valves, equal
valve-stem height is a fundamental assumption on the same order as 'wheels are
round'.  It is something so basic and widely understood it is rarely
mentioned.

As to your specific question YES!  

Here again, basic assumptions are involved, one being that the engine
assembler understands the significance of the rocker-arm to the valve stem.
When setting-up the valve train the standard is to insure the center-line of
the adjuster falls upon the center-line of the valve stem at 50% of the lift
of the cam.  Instructors love to baffle you with the math inherent in this
mechanical fact of life but the bottom line is that setting-up the valve-train
geometry in this fashion insures it will absorb the least amount of energy to
do its job.  But get the geometry off by even a small amount and the amount of
energy needed to actuate the valves spikes up to something like eight times
(!) the optimum value.  And that's assuming the engine is volumetrically
balanced to begin with.  Where does that extra energy go?  Ultimately, it
appears as heat but the interesting part is how that mechanical motion gets
converted into heat.  A lot of it comes from the energy dissipated by the mis-
aligned rockers as they scrub the valve-stem against the side of the valve-
guide.  The net result is a hotter-running, less efficient, less durable
engine.  

Other even more basic assumptions involve the relationship of the cam to the
crankshaft.  With stock VW components there isn't a lot you can do in this
regard but given even normal variations amont cranks, cases and cams you
should at least check that the components you're using meet the published spec
for lift &amp; duration, which are of course relative to the postion of the crank.
If they are wildly out of spec you can shop for a different cam, an off-set
key-way or an adjustable cam-gear or perhaps fiddle with the valve stem
heights a bit, depending on how they depart from spec.

As a general rule, with stock components and all eight valve stems of equal
height, you'll only have to worry about the rocker alignment.  But you should
also know that there are a couple of horse-power's-worth of wasted performance
lurking in the stock VW valve train geometry.  Proper assembly can saddle
those horses and put them to work for no greater cost than careful attention
to detail.  But you gotta know a latigo from a chingadaro... and it helps if
you know how to ride :-)
