&gt; well, heres how i see it. personally i am not comfortable giving someone
&gt; advice about a fix unless i am SURE i know what im talking about OR i can
&gt; speak from personal experience, like if something has worked for me. but
&gt; their seems to be four kinds of people on this list.

My position exactly! Never a comment unless I'm dead positive. There is no
sense in spreading almost good information.

&gt; there are people on this list who are very knowledgable and respond to
every
&gt; inquiry; thom, eric, clara, etc... you know who. (regardless if you like
&gt; their responses or not :-) the bus guru's.

Yes again and I'd like to express my gratitude. These folks need a round of
applause from all of us.

&gt; then there are people who sit and wait for someone to respond, and then
all
&gt; they do is say how wrong that person was. WTF! where was their response if
&gt; they are sooo smart. they are on this list just to stir up the pot.

Well yeah, but all baskets have a bad apple or two. Every train has a last
car.

&gt; then there are the guys that have to tell us about every time they fart in
&gt; their bus. these guys LIVE for aircolled VWs... which is cool, i like to
&gt; read stories and stuff.

If I don't have time to enjoy these, I know where my delete key is.

&gt; then , there are people that arent bus einstein's and are here to
enlighten
&gt; themselves and take in as much as they can. this is where i fall. i can do
&gt; just about anything to fix my bus, but start talking R&amp;P's and see ya
later.

I see this as a primary function of the list.

&gt; but overall, this list has gotten very spiteful over the last three years
i
&gt; have been on it. almost not worth sifting through all the emails every
day.
&gt; im not whining, just giving you my opinion.

Again, We know where the delete key is.

&gt; now dont reply to me, i dont care what you have to say, im just callin it
&gt; like i see it. no big thing.

Ok I'm going to call it like I see it as well. If one individual can not
deal with the problems of list life, we should let him go, say good bye, and
get on with our business. However this individual should just leave, be
graceful and go. The comments made are simply a propagation of his problem
with this list. So I say good bye to you, enjoy your Volkswagens and when
you come back I for one will welcome you.
