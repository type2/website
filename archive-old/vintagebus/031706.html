I've got them laid out by the back roll up at my shop, I don't know how to
date them but I took them out of splits on my back east BD adventure.

Subject: [VB] Cargo mat dating


I was over at a VW guy's house yesterday and he had a bunch of cargo mats
all laid out on his front walkway (damn showoff).  We noticed all of them
were slightly different and the question came up, is there a way to date
a cargo mat based on it's markings or style?  All of the mats in question
were black, in this case.

Interested,
