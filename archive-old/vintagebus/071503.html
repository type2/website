Subject: [VB] seat stand mats


&gt; I just got a pair of seat stand mats from Wolfsburg West and was wondering
&gt; what type of adhesive would be best to use. Also, I was thinking there
&gt; should be a metal strip along the door side for it to slip into but my bus
&gt; does not have that. The old ones were held in place by 10 screws with
&gt; washers (which I know wasn't correct). I'd appreciate any advice you might
&gt; have.

Fabricate the strip with a &quot;flanging&quot; tool
used to form lap joints in sheetmetal.
Check the Eastwood catalogue or any good
autobody restoration facility will have one.
It's sold as an air tool or hand tool.
Make your own with an old Vise-Grip pliers.
