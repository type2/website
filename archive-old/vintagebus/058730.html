Subject: Temporary Solutions

I have several questions for a temporary restore of my '62 EZ. These 
questions include bondo questions which I know is a hands off conversation 
for some. So, the plan is to get my bus painted and looking good for the 
time being and do a more complete restore in a year or two. The obstacles 
are, very little $ in pocket right now, several dings, small cancers on both 
doglegs, some patches of bondo on the doors that have cracked, not a ton of 
time or tools and, did I say, very little $. Anyway, my questions are:

Should I remove the small bondo patches that have cracked and put down fresh 
bondo for the time being to get the bus ready for paint? There are only 2 
spots that have bondo and pounding these spots out would probably not work. 
Pulling them would be too time consuming and I just don't have the tools.

Rusty patches are another topic. I have access to welding equiptment but 
what should I use to weld over these areas? I have begun to cut out the 
cancer area to clean metal. Any other easy advice?

These are temporary solutions for now! I plan on having my bus a very long 
time and over the years I look forward to stripping it down to bare metal, 
replacing the rusty areas with new metal, etc.

Thanks in advance,
Joshua
