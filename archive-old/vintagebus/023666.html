I have noticed ongoing questions about engine rpms to vehicle mph relationship in
old split buses, and I been doing a little research on RPM -MPH correspondence for
old splits. I have decided to post some printed information from my Factory VW
Workshop manual.  These specs are for stock factory VW buses...running correct
size bias ply tires (as standard radials are usually very much smaller then the
original Bias-plys...thus giving false MPH readings on some buses.)

Taken from: &quot;`63-`67 Volkswagen Transporter Official VW Workshop Manual , Robert
Bentley, pub.&quot;

`63-`64, 3/4 ton vehicle with 1200 cc engine
Maximum speed 60 mph _at_ 3620 rpm

`63-`64, 3/4 ton vehicle with 1500 cc engine (optional)
Maximum speed 65 mph _at_ 3620 rpm
This bus has identical tranny to the 1200 cc but with 1-26 instead of 1-39 ratio
reduction boxes

`64 1 ton vehicle with 1500 cc engine (optional)
At 60 mph 3660 rpm
Maximum speed 65 mph _at_ 4050 rpm

`66-`67 1 ton with 1500 cc now standard on all models
At 60 mph 3660 rpm
Maximum speed 65 mph _at_ 4040 rpm

According to VW, these are all safe and permissible speeds/engine rpm's you can
run in your stock bus. Also..If you notice as VW increased the vehicles engine
size 1500 cc and load rating to 1 ton, it also adjusted the final drive in
transmission to actually run the 1500 cc engine at a HIGHER rpm then the earlier
3/4 ton vehicles with a optional 1500 cc motor. Seems VW likes the split bus
engine to run _at_ around 3600 rpms at  top speed.

I do believe that VW is not 100% perfect, and nothing can ever be improved upon.
but..I just wanted to make note that with correct specifications (ie. correct
compression ratios, octane of fuels, and tire sizes), it is possible to run your
bus stock at top speed 60-65 mph with the corresponding engine rpms, and not blow
up your engine or tranny in your bus.  Remember, the bus motor pushes a lot more
weight, and has a much less aerodynamic designed body then a bug.  I have heard a
bug runs 60 mph _at_ 3000-3200 rpm give or take...it makes sense that a bus engine
would need to run at a higher rpm for more power at max. speed. I would also
suspect the higher engine rpms also aids in runs your cooling fan faster to
compensate for the extra heat the motor dispels pushing a much heavier vehicle.

I am not disputing that things can be improved upon.... but just wanted to post
that according to VW you should be ok running an old bus completely stock.

&gt; The first thing to do is buy or borrow a tach for 15 minute drive and see
&gt; where 1,500 &amp; 3,000RPM are in all four forward gears at what MPH.  You
&gt; probably have a stock geared tranny that does 3,000RPM at or below 50 MPH.  We
&gt; have info on modifying the stock tranny keeping the reduction boxes and being
&gt; able to do 60+MPH in fourth at 3,000RPM.
