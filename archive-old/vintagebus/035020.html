Subject: Re:  [VB] Spare tire cover

Does anyone know where I could find the spare tire cover for a 63 deluxe

microbus. It is a non walkthrough, and the cover faces the cargo area. I

have been looking for a while and have had no luck, any lead would be nice.


Thanks,

a non walk through came with a metal bulkhead behind the front seats.  you 
have to tip he seats forward and push all the junk you hrew back there out of 
the way to remove the spare tire.  I dont think they ever came with a 
cloth/vinyl cover there.   are you talking about the metal bulkhead?   It 
should have matching interior panelng attached to the side facing the cargo 
area, idealy, though this can be found and added later.

if so these are around, but as they are large you might want to mention your 
location.
