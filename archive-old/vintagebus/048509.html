Subject: Poppin' Trans and the Shows

Thanks to all for the replies; I ran into the Rancho guys at the Classic,
but they told me they had no transmissions in stock. I may end up doing
business with them when we get home. Spoke to Rick Long from Long
Enterprises this morning and he gave some great tips on transaxles.

So, I changed out the fluids and I'll keep a bungee on hand when the hills
pop up and see what happens. No guts, no air medals.

Had a nice time at OCTO and the Classic, met a lot of great people and got
an awesome sunburn. Had too many places I would have liked to have seen and
not enough time to do it in. After seeing what a lot of people were
charging at the Classic swaps, I think I'll drag some stuff out next year
and maybe I can retire early. :)

Everett R.

I brought my laptop on this trip, so if I break I can update the list with
live footage from 'HammerCam', the unofficial Road Trip show of the Classic
2001.
