Hey All-

I am trying to preserve a mostly original 65 standard that i got a year or
so back.

The bus originally came with all pop out side windows (6), however over the
course of time one of thepopt outs on the pass side cargo door has actually
came off.

I would like to put it back on (i.e, spot weld it back on) but don't want to
burn up my nice original paint (hello patina) in the process.

The options I see are

1. spot weld and hope for the best
2. forget the pop out and just go with stationary glass
3. try and find some of that shmancy fancy glue i hear about that they are
using to &quot;glue&quot; cars together these days and try reattaching the hinge that
way??

This is the front window on the cargo door that opens to the front, this
also probably explains why it came off in the first place (due to lotsa wind
blowing thru and ultimately weaking it)

Any thoughts/suggestions/ideas welcome please p-mail as I am in in digest
mode.

Danke

M.
