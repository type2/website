hey all-

i am shopping for some new german wheel cylinders and shoes for my 65 bus.

i have been quoted a price of $40 a pop US bucks for the wheel cylinder$ (p/n
211 611 069c and 211 611 070c which i assume are correct for my year)

soooooooo...... assuming that the p/n for the wheel cylibders for my bus year
are correct does $40 a pop seem priceY?? ($160 to do the whole front end i
figger i think they have two wheel cylinder ea/ on the front end)

any one know of a cheaper source for german wheel cylinders?? would prefer to
avoid brazillian schtuff..

I am happy using that good Brasilian Varga brake stuff when available.     It 
is for the 64-67 buses, but 63 and earlier front no, so German only for that. 
 I have seen prices $25 to $35 per cylinder for German, usually $35 now, and 
so $40 is pretty close.  yup  pricey.  Guess why I use Brasilian?      

BUT  avoid the Indian brake cylinders.  really .   made wrong.    at least 
when I took apart a new one in the store a few years ago, the ID was wrong, 
too small.   got that good brasilian stuff instead.
