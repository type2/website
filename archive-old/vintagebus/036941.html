&lt;&lt; Here's what I need your help with: In your opinions, who really does
 make the best quality seat covers for everyday use and how is their
 customer service??  Is it worth the money to buy the &quot;pre-formed&quot;
 cushions or are they just pre-cut flat foam that is easily made at
 home??  Thanks again the advice.

 The TMI seat covers I got from the Bus Depot seem to be good quality.The 
only complaint I had with installing those was they didn't have the wire sewn 
into the bottom.The TMI covers use a draw sting.Otherwise I installed them 
exactly as the originals,using the existing &quot;meat hook prongs&quot; and new 
bailing wire.
 My main complaint was with the so called preformed pads.After getting the 
covers on the piping didn't match up with the edges of the foam.I probably 
could have played with them a while to get a better fit, but hell seats are 
for sittin... not for lookin.
 If your hog hair cushions are in good shape you may just want to add a thin 
layer of foam and reuse them for a better fit. I saved mine for future use.
