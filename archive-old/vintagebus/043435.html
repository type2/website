&gt;Now the rear tail-lights don't work.  The rear signal lights and brake
&gt;lights both work fine but the tail lights don't come on when the headlight
&gt;switch is pulled out.

Check both fuses.  A test light should show power to both tail light
fuses with the headlight switch pulled out to the first or second
click.  If no power, either the wire between the headlight switch
and the fuse box is broken or your headlight switch is broken.
If you have power and the fuses are OK, it's either the two wires
running from front to back or the bulbs.  The fact that your brake
lights work mostly clears the tail light grounds from suspicion.

&gt;And a stereo - how should I wire that.  I currently have it just plugged
&gt;into a fuse but what is the right way.

Look at your far right fuse and find the end with the two fat red wires
connected to it.  Connect your stereo through an inline fuse (the stereo
probably already has one) to this point - this is &quot;hot all the time&quot;
power.  Just don't forget to turn your stereo off when you park and
get out.  :) If your stereo has a ground wire, connect it to a good
ground.

&gt;And a cigarette lighter.

Same deal.  It connects to the same place through an inline fuse -
a 15A fuse will probably be plenty.  (If you only want to carry
one style of fuse, use a VW-type inline fuse holder and a 16A fuse.
Otherwise use the regular FLAPS inline fuse holder and a 15A glass
fuse.)  Also make sure to ground the other terminal of the lighter
socket.  Use at least 14 gauge wire for both connections.

Good luck!
