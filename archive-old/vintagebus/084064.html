Subject: Re: [VB] Axle tube scuffing/galling (swing axle tranny)

In a message dated 2/13/2006 2:07:50 A.M. Pacific Standard Time,  
dim1_at_comcast_dot_net writes:

&gt;&gt;  Is it possible to clean up scuffing/galling of the spherical surfaces 
where  
the inner portion of the axle tube mates to the tranny side plate?   
Binding can be eliminated by adding flange gaskets but no  noticeable play is 
permitted.  &lt;&lt;
Hi Phil,
Sure with various grades of sand paper, elbow grease, and some  time.  Was 
there the plastic kind of daisy bearing in that area, or was it  missing, and 
that caused the scuffing?
