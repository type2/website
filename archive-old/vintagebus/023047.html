There's one doohickey which hangs from the cargo doors.  The only other
option is to get a late-model drive-away tent.

&gt;there any type of tent or more or less awning that does not require holes or 
&gt;brackets in the roof of my bus? I am willing to drill the small holes in my 
&gt;bumper. Just curious.
