CONGRATULATIONS DAD!

And you thought oil changes every 3K were frequent.  Those diaper
changes
make tranny oil smell like nectar from the gods.  You'll both do fine.
Its
work, but you'll love every second.

Her name would have been Moonbeam Starshine Ellis if you were true
hippies.
Just ditch the tie-dye outfits...its a dead giveaway mom and dad are
long
hairs :-)

Congrats again!

Steve Harris
