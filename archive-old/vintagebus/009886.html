I had the same thing happen - intake valve on #3 -  on the 1600SP in our old
'68 Campmobile.

Just kept it properly adjusted and got another 12-15,000 miles out of it
before it finally was obvious surgery was necessary.  The engine was
otherwise healthy but had lots of miles, so we went the cheap route and just
replaced the left head.

We put another 40,000+ miles on the engine before we sold the van to buy our
current '70 Campmobile, and that was mostly charging up and down I-5 between
Puget Sound and Central and Southern California.  Never had a bit of
trouble, despite &quot;conventional wisdom&quot;.

YMMV.....

&gt;&gt; This engine is up for replacement soon, but I hoped to get about 2000
more miles out of it (trips to Nevada and to BBBIV) before pulling it.  I
plan on running it another 400 miles and then checking the valve clearance
again.

Speculation?  Horror stories?  Gales of laughter? &lt;&lt;
