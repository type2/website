yep, i'll side with clara on both counts. while i'm not nearly as much as a
gearhead as most here, i've been driving my '60 daily for over a year now on an
H-case. this is a &quot;runs strong&quot; $65 engine i bought last year at a local swap
meet. threw a rebuilt 30pict1, vac dizzy and oil bath air cleaner on, tuned it up,
and it's been faithfully moving me 40-60 miles daily and has made several
uneventful 300 mile trips. it does drip just a bit and the oil light comes on at
idle, but...  i keep saving for a good rebuilt or new engine, but the dang thing
just keeps running!

anyone going to the columbus, oh show tomorrow? todd s is right, it's certainly
one of the best vintage shows here in midwest. i'm going but can only stay until
about noon :-(  got an afternoon gig.

oh, and como green does indeeed ROCK!
