Like I've said before, VW would be happy as a lamb if all of us ACVW
people took a  long walk off of a short pier.  All we're good for is
promotional background.  Kind of like how celebrities do high-profile
charity work; do just enough to get your name in the papers so you'll
go see their new movie, then run home and wash your hands after coming 
in contact with the dirty masses.
