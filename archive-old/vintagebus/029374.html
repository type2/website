Subject: knock knock

hello all...
bad thing happened this morning...
as I was driving to school... after I filled up with gas... cruisin down
the road at 25mph... i hear this awful knocking sound...so i pull over
right away and shut it down...
i run home (about 3/4 mile from home) change in to my grubby
clothes...run back... pop off the valve covers thinking i threw a
pushrod or something...and I couldn't find anything wrong...  all
pushrods were in place and adjusted (the valves were) and all the valves
were still there...so I didn't suck one in...
Its this awful metal on metal knocking sound.... almost like a diesel
motor.  I *had* to drive it home... at slow speeds... and it would
rattle real bad...and then go away...then it would come back a few
seconds later...it kept doing this...
I thought maybe i had too much oil in (i did have a bit much) so i
drained some out just now....and it still does the same thing...

when i stuck the heads back on two days ago...i made sure that nothing
was in there...
a rod knock wouldn't just start all of the sudden and go in and out
would it??
I have no idea what this is...any help is greatly appreciated.... I'm
supposed to be in school right now.....ggeeeeez.  2nd day back
today...that looks really good!  :(

Isaiah
