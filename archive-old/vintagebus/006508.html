Very nice Bus! Congratulation! Looks like Sundial was doing everything the
way you described since I had a 64 that was also full of paneling. I mean
there was a side clothes closet, both sides were paneled, headliner, front
overhead, front doors and there was even a small compartment above the bed.
I also thought that it was just fabricated by previous owner but sure looks
like it was not.


Good luck,

Andre

&gt; Hi all--

&gt;snip&lt;

&gt; She's a Sundial conversion, at least that's what the little metal plate
says.
&gt; Anybody know what's supposed to be inside? This one just has a bed and
closet
&gt; to hang clothes. And wow, what a shade of paneling. Do I *have* to keep ot
&gt; stock? :~) BTW, instead of a headliner there is the same paneling up top.
Is
&gt; this the way Sundial's came or is this someone's elaboration on the theme?
&gt;
