Cobra 11 is a movie - serial production German movie airing all over Europe now and very popular.
Action concept is a company that takes care of all the stunts for the movie. I have found some nice
pictures.... Internet - 21st century. Can find anything...
Here's another site but this one is in Polish... try Gallery (Galeria) for more pictures).
peace,

| That's not German on that page.... that's Slovak or Czech ... and this movie is a serial
production
| airing on Czech TV right now. At least that's what I think since Polish and Slovak are closely
| related languages.

| I'm trying to get more info from the Bus list in Poland about this movie....
