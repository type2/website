Hey all,

I emailed a guy with Flat 4 Repro BRMs on his bus that still has RGBs.  I 
believe these rims have the same offset and dim. as the repro sprint stars 
but am not sure about the eagle empi 5s, I think the other rims are 5j and 
empi repros are 5.5j.  Anyway this it what the nice bus driver had to say:Hi 
Eric! -

      As for the BRM's, the offset is fine. I am running 195/60R15 tires.
They do clear the rear fender lip, but it is close and they have never hit
the body. As for bolting them up on the rear axle. You do need to modify the
drums and stub axles. I cut 1 inch off of the axles and 3/4 of an inch off 
of
the drums themselves. Once you cut the axles, you will need to have them
rethreaded and drilled for the cotter pin.
      One thing to look at when you do this, replace the bearings in the
reduction gears if needed. You will have to split the reduction boxes anyway
to get to the axles. Also, by adding a 3.88:1 ring and pinion, you will do
highway speeds without a problem. Try to keep with the bug nut axle, these
axles have the tallest reduction gears offered, 19:21.

                                                          Good Luck!

                                                               Jake

Just thought some of you would be interested.
