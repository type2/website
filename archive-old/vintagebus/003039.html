yeah i guess you are right if i had chopped a hundred,  one or even two thirty
five years ago then sold it with my dealer name scrawled on it ,it would be
acceptable. it might even be sought after . since sundials came that way from
Hanover i guess it is a original vw then huh? oh wait a minute they didn't come
from the factory like that somebody took there vision chopped some buses and
made it happen. also i suppose all non factory endorsed coachbuilts and
conversions are hack as well?besides in a community such as this is would be
best to support and not criticize others ,as you neither know me ,my tastes
,collection, or things i have you may someday need
