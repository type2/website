 &gt;What was the original color of the cargo door check strap mounting bracket
 that screws into the cargo door?  Black?  Color of the lower portion of the
 Bus?  Different for early Westies?  I'm at that point with the Westy and
 inquiring minds need to know.
 &gt;
 I've never seen an original mounting bracket that was not black.  But I only
 really pay attention to Commercials.
 
 I've seen a few straps, repros always seem to be black, original usually are
 green.  But I've seen a few other colors, Khaki comes to mind.  I always let
 them be as they were screwed-up originals.  I assume some years the straps
 were black since they chose that color to reproduce.  FYI, the repro fabric
 looks a bit off and feels wrong.

metal bracket- black

strap- off white/khaki usually with black grease smears
