Subject: Retarded advance.._dot_carb upgrade?

Hi all,
I'm pushing along my '67 camper with a new 1600dp, 009, and freshly
rebuilt 34 pict 3, yet I'm not advancing enough (yes, even after
thorough tune-up) and get a big dead spot in acceleration around
3000rpm's.  I looked on the archives and it was noted that this combo of
dizzy and carb just doesn't click.
Will my problem be solved by sticking on a set of duals?  Can anyone
attest to fixing this any other way (bigger single carb, dizzy
alternatives, electronic ignition)?
I would like to maximize torque as I am switching to a freeway flyer
tranny (which will be ready next weekend!!!).
Thanks again list,
mark
PS. Anyone have a set of duals available reasonably dialed in for a
1600??
