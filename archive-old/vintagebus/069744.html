Subject: 64 Panel for Sale

Hi All

I have a 64 panel van for sale.  It was a daily driver until last week when
it threw a rod and had a small engine compartment fire.  Damage was limited
to the engine compartment and engine wiring on the left side.

I have done some work on it to rebuild the front end, replace brake
cylinders, brake lines, hand brake cables, and gas tank/sender.  I've
collected a variety of body repair panels that we to be a project to
repair/sand blast and paint this summer.  I also have a full range of seats
(front passenger bench, middle seat (I think it's the right series), and
rear.  Also in cluded is a walk-thru section that we were going to install
so the dogs could sit close to us.

I hate to give this up but I just moved to the L.A. beaches area and have no

where at all to work on it or to park it.  The drawback to living at the
beach is loss of room.

Hope it goes to a good home.  I can send pictures to anyone interested.

Thanks to the list for all your good advice over the years.

Andy McDonald
