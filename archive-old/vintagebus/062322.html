Subject: RE: [VB] Advice needed-Deck Height. Short block-Shaved head

Dave,
All things being equal, that is, the cylinder bases are the same distance
from the crank center, and the pistons are the same height, deck height is
determined as follows:

Place a straight edge across a cylinder with the piston run all the way up.
For a standard 1500/1600 and 1641, you should have .060 clearance with a
feeler gauge stuck under your straight edge. That is VW's optimum clearance
for longevity with a 54-56cc head. If all of your parts are factory
tolerance you will have the optimum. I use barrel shims on the bottom of the
barrel, although my last engine was so close that I was able to use the .008
paper gaskets and be practically right on. On first time fly cut heads I use
.100 clearance.

You just want to make sure that your pistons and valves never meet !

Al-
Your previous post confused deck height with engine balance.
This one has deck height confused with cylinder head flycut.
Deck height is the distance from the piston ( at the top of it's
stroke ) to the top of the cylinder.Heads do not affect deck height.
Case decking does, however.

Heads are flycut individually, and it's entirely possible to install
one which is flycut and one which isn't , or one cut deeper.
The flycut will have direct effect on chamber volumes.
That is the function of measuring chamber volumes, to determine
that chambers match, as well as providing proper and equal CR.
