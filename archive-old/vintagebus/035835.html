does anybody have any pull-over stories while driving a bus? i love pull
over stories. 

once i was driving my old 73 on st. patrick's night. it was a little cold
out and i was coming home from my cousin's house (clean as a whistle). i
turned right on to one of the main roads and my bus almost stalled, but only
enough for the lights to not come back on. in an attept of not getting
pulled over, i turned at the next not-so-busy road and stopped at the next
stop sign (i should have just pulled over). i restarted my bus and on the
other side of the intersection was another car. so i started chanting
&quot;please don't be a cop, please don't be a cop.&quot; it was a cop. he pulled me
over (coincidentally, right in front of they guy's house that sold it to
me). i had only had the bus for about two weeks and hadn't got it registered
yet. i tried, but the DMV idiots said that i needed to go through emmisions.
well, that's what i just did that day. i pulled up and they guy said: &quot;what
are you doing here?&quot; being the smart alek that i am i said, &quot;well, i guess
i'm not sure.&quot; he said i didn't need to get  an emmisions test because it
was a pre 76 vehicle. stupid dmv. so, anyway, back to the intersection. the
cop asks for my liscense and reg. i give told him the schpiel how i just got
it and i actually got it from the guy who lives across the street from where
we were. he asked if i had been drinking. i said no, sir.  he aske dif this
was my vehicle and i said &quot;yes sir,  you can go wake him up and ask him if
you'd like.&quot; he said that wouldn't be neccesary and went back to his car. he
came back with two tickets. one for failing to register the vehicle and one
for expired tabs. for a total of $212! i asked how i was supposed to pay for
registration now. he didn't know.
