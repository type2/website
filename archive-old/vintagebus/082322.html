Hi SLOJason,
First tach your engine RPM in each forward gear for when you hit 3,000 RPM  
and 1,500 in 2-4th gears.  As type 1 owners before we got into type  2s, going 
above 3,000 RPM was a known no no, if one wanted long term life  span from the 
engines.  When we got our 1963 SC it never sounded like it  was over revving, 
but turned out we were doing 3,800 RPM just to do 55  MPH!  In the bus the 
driver is even more forward away from the engine and  tranny than in a type 1 
and the wind at speed seems to push the engine  noise away due to the flat 
sides, even if you have the front door windows  open.  We went from 30-40,000 miles 
between rebuilds to 80,000 miles just  by dropping our cruising RPM to 3,000 
RPM.  Also went from 18-19 MPG to 27  MPG with our 40 HP engines.  Now getting 
23 MPG with 1641SP CW engine with  now over 60,000 miles, with 3.875 R&amp;P &amp; 
.82 4th tranny.  We  have over 250,000 miles that we have put on, between our 
1963 Sc and the  1960 walk thru panel camper conversion!  As 
Eric&amp;Barb
