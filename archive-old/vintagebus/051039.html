&gt; The PO said the old starter (6 volt) died (didn't explain much)and so he 
&gt; went out and bought a 12 volt starter (the bus has been converted to 12 
&gt; volt but I can't tell how thorough of a job was done [wipers go so fast 
&gt; they must still be 6 volt + speedometer dosen't work but I'm not sure if 
&gt; that would be effected]).  I'm 99% positive that the flywheel is still the 
&gt; smaller 6volt size but the PO said the rebuilt 12v starter he bought was 
&gt; designed for a 6v flywheel.  Have any of you heard of this?

Hi Kurt,
Sounds fishy!  Best to remove the engine and figure what has been done in 
there and what needs replacing before things tear themselfs apart.  Get a 
resistor for the wiper motor or it will not last much longer and 66 motors do 
not grow on trees anymore.  Check your speedo cable connections and replace 
the cable if needed.

  I've heard that a bushing needs to be changed in the tranny for this to 
work.  My 
&gt; current thinking is to try a new solenoid on the supposedly &quot;new&quot; rebuilt 
&gt; 12v starter.

If your starter works when jumpered with a screw driver or open wrench, it is 
fine.  Though you need to know if it matches the FW or not!  Your battery 
cable could still be bad due to not being able to pass enough amperage, but 
since your starter jumpered fine that does not sound like the problem.  So 
you need to check, clean, and solder (Especially the fuse box parts and 
headlight switch pieces!) the connections from the starter to the fuse box, 
to the headlight switch to the ignition switch, and back to the solinoid.  
Check the type2 library for the article we wrote with Matt on headlight 
switch cleaning and soldering for brighter whiter headlights, signals and 
better starting.   Eric&amp;Barb
