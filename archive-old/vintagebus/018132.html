Subject: Backing plates, what to do?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi all,

I just dismantled all four brakes of my doublecab to
start the brake system replacement/resto.  I
sandblasted one of the backing plates, and was pretty
happy with the results, so I'll probably do the others
when I can.  Question is what should I do for the
newly sandblasted backing plates?  I figured I have
three options: Powder coating, Zinc primed and
rattle-canned, or POR-15.  (What color?  I thought
plain old gloss black)  There is no rust, so I'm not
really inclined to do the POR-15 route.  This will be
my daily ride, so I wanted the coating to last, what
ever it may be.  Also, should I try to rebuild the
cylinders, or just buy new ones?  These are the
original ones.  I've already purchased all new brake
lines, hoses, shoes for the rear, and springs for the
rear.  I'll probably be ordering the stuff for the
front in the next few weeks, as money comes available.

TIA!
Paul
