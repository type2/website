Subject: RE: [VB] Dual circuit upgrade

I sent the MC and kit back to Wolfgang for fitting.  There is no boot used
in the factory install of these master cylinders as it was mounted flush
with the booster and sealed by a square O-ring.  In a normal install there
would probably be a cut in the end of the MC for the boot to seat in.  With
the Wolfgang kit the boot is supposed to be stretched over the MC.  The ID
of the adapter spacer  is such that it will fit with the boot on the MC and
the depth of the counter bore will accommodate the large diameter of the MC
plus the displaced portion of the rubber boot.  The fit is supposed to be a
little tight to keep the boot in place.  Hopefully Wolfgang will be sure to
ask future customers if they are using the German MC or not.

I ran into the same thing with a German master cylinder and the Wolfgang
spacer -- the nose of the MC is just a millimeter or two too big to fit
into the spacer.  I machined the spacer a bit with a file and a Dremel
to get the MC to fit.

Also, the rubber boot Wolfgang supplies is meant for the Brazilian MC.
It doesn't fit very well over the nose of the ATE MC, and the MC won't
fit in the spacer at all with the boot installed.  I checked the spacer
and the boot against a Brazilian cylinder at the FLAPS and everything
fit just fine.  I did put the boot on but it's not secured to the front
of the MC - maybe some RTV would help.
