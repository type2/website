Ok, I messed around with the bus more today, but my limited knowledge
lessens my comfort level with going further without some guidance. I
adjusted the valves, per Muir at .006, and, while it runs smoother and
doesn't backfire, it doesn't STAY RUNNING!?! If I keep the clutch out, it
stays running for about 20 seconds, then bogs out. Tap the gas you say? HA!
It bogs out and stalls. I'm at the end of my wits here, it ran fine when I
parked it, and now it doesn't. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.
