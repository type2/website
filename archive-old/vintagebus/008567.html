&gt;I don't know about usual, but I had a 59 truck last year, and it had a 68

&gt;Had to lift the bottom of the seat up, which meant lifting the back of it
out.

you've got the picture -  - there are 2 long (a foot) pipes coming from the
reservoir down to the MC. seems a bit of a dodgy thing to do that does. -
one thing at a time tho.
the worst thing about the reservoir being under the seat is that i always
forget to move the seats out of the way before i get my hands cruddy. :(

&gt;look in your bentley guide-  there is a certain amount the rod should move
&gt;before actually pushing the master sylinder.    But if this was off it
would
&gt;affect al brakes evenly.

that's what i'd have thought - so i'll go there last.

&gt;possible symptoms of bad flex hoses...
&gt;

thanks Clara.
seems like it is the one way valve thing happening - i fetched a flex hose
&gt;from my local VW dealers parts, was skint - but i remembered he owed me some
credit.
just got under the bus last night, to relace the hose, to find it was too
long..... so to tonight it is then.
