Subject: Child Car Seats and Ventage Bus


Hello all,

Am fairly new to the list and have a question that can
be answered (hopefully) via the list or pmail.

I don't currently have a bus (egads! but wait I've
owned any number of busses, bugs and 3's in the past
so don't kick me...) but plan to rejoin the ranks
soon.  My hope and desire is to come back by getting a
westy of the 60 to 65 vintage.  Issue I have is that I
also have two kids still using car seats.  I would
have no way to strap the seats and hence the kids
down.  Are there any other vintage Westy owners that
also travel with toddlers and therefore deal with the
car seat issue?  If so, I'd like to hear how you came
up with seatbelts or other restraints for the child
car seat.

Thanks much and sorry for the extended post!

Joe Reynolds
