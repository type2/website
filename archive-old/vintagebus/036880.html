Hi all,

Since the recent list problems, and my recent post concerning a
grinding/howling sound with the clutch pedal depressed, following a
trans/clutch/T.O. bearing replacement (30 miles ago), I have observed the
following:

This sound only occurs after driving my bus for about 15 minutes.  If I start
her up tomorrow morning- all sounds good.  15-20 minutes of driving later, at
rest, with clutch pedal in-the sound.  Release pedal, goes away.  Doesn't
matter if trans is in neutral or in gear, release pedal and it goes away.  No
problem actually shifting once I get going though.  Recent replacement with
rebuilt trans from KCR, new clutch, bearing. I'm puzzled.  Just asking before
I pull engine.  Free play on pedal around 1&quot;  Any tips from you all?

Much appreciated,

Jeff
