Subject: Re: [VB] CB Radio antenna



&gt; Happy Friday everyone,
&gt; Some of you must be using CB radios in your busses. What kind of
&gt; antenna did you end up using, and where did you put it? I want the
&gt; radio for local traffic info, summoning help in an emergency, maybe
&gt; the occasional convoy. I don't need to be able to talk to folks in 
New
&gt; Zealand, but I do travel in some remote US locations, mountains,
&gt; deserts and the like, and I'd like to be able to call for help from
&gt; there. Any suggestions before I buy the wrong one?

The KISS principle applies here.  The longer the antenna, up to a 1/4 
wave whip, the better for your already meager output.  Many people do 
well with a 4' or 6' Firestik antenna from a truck supply shop.  You 
can spend a lot of $$$ on fancy antennas and do no better.

Installation is important, as the antenna needs a good ground to work 
well.  I put mine on the roof rack, and grounded the roof rack to the 
body at two points with copper strip.

If you just want to keep in touch when in a busavan, it makes a lot 
more sense for everyone to get one of those little FRS handheld 
radios.  They work better and there's no installation involved!

George
