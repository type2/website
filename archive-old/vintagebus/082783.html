mileage is fer crap. do i go up in main size, and find some emulsion tubes that pass 
more air at speed???
Hi Craig,
Just going up in main jet size will add more fuel.  What you need is a jet 
sizing tool and check the openings in the jets first.  Even new we have found 
jets to be of differant size than the stamped markings, and with so many miles 
and gallons of fuel through the jets they get worn open more and more.  Then 
get out the &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; and find the jetting sizes for your year 
bus/engine.
