The PO put down this sorta rubber stuff on the floor of my truck.  I'm sure
it was a great idea at the time but over the years parts of the rubber has
come and rust has developed.  My idea was to remove the rubber and POR15 the
interior floor.  This has turned out to be more difficult than expected.
This rubber crap doesn't NOT want to come off.  I bought automotive paint
stripper at NAPA;kinda works but not really.  I bought some aircraft
stripper in a aerosol can; again not working well.  I tried grinder and wire
wheel but the both just get loaded with rubber stuff and I spend hours
cleaning them.  Anyone have a good idea for getting this stuff up?  I'm
getting ready to go try torching it.
