Captive nut sounds like my job description! Free the 
nut! Free the nut!

Actually, I am about to put a starter in my '62 and 
remember what a PITA it was to get that top bolt tight 
last time. Where did you find this nifty tool? Have a 
picture? It seems like it would be a good companion to 
my 17mm ratcheting box end wrench.

 Free the Nut!   I find it easier to put a nut on it and 
turn it inside the 
engine compartment.   Awkward to get it past the clutch 
arm etc, for me at 
least.  Some cases take the half moon on that side, 
keeps them from turning.  
 For the ones that dont, I have a nifty tool that has a 
magnetic hex 17mm 
thing and arms to keep it from turning.   Use a ratchet 
wrench in the engine 
compartment.   If people want the captive nuts, I have a 
couple I removed 
from cases.
