I just picked up my 66 from a local gearbox guy, it originally went in for
an IRS conversion, but as the brake drums for the old wheels that were
compatible with the proper wheels could not be found, he offered me a disc
brake front end as well. (I refuse to carry 2 styles of spare)  I went for
it as his rep is very good. The gearbox was replaced with a type 3, welding
was done, shockers put, the front beam is (I think) a 1970 with later model
disc brake stubs on it. Swaybar too. I am not totally familiar with this
stuff, so if it sounds impossible I probably have described it wrong.
BUT F*#k it goes.  And it sticks. Not so much power but legs. 18 mph in
1st.(no tach but comfortable free-spin style of revs) 33mph in 2nd, 55mph in
3d, I will let you know about top when I get the wheel alignment done, but I
decided to stop pressing the pedal at 70mph. When I pressed on the brakes I
nearly wept. It stops on a dime/2bob.
Corners, I tell you I do not miss rear end jittering around hard corners.
It squats down and goes round. The thrill of the day was finding that the
new, later model, less beautiful wheels will accept the old style hubcaps!
The motor is a 1500 so its not fast, but it doesnt seem to be using any
petrol either.
Still bugpak extractors and a 009 dist should give the little more low end
it needs.
    Now to save for new seals and paint...
If anybody wants a photo of this stuff let me know and I will post.
    This lot has addressed every limitation of beloved bus w/o a single
Chevvy part. I am stoked. Going to sell my Maz_at_a!
