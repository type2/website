So a number of folks said they are 356 rims- is that the sort they came with? 
 or an option to get chromed rims?  Some people said it was offered by EMPI 
in a 60's catalog. Did they contract with Lemerz?

Anyway, how hard would it be to find 2 more?  I could get the offset changed 
on two so they would fit the rear wheel wells.

Still not sure if I want to use them or if I think chrome rims are silly.
