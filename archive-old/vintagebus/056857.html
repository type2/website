&lt;&lt; I'm spending the evening (or whats left of it) trying to replace my front
 door and cargo door seals.  The old ones are hard and crack when I push on
 them.  I can get most of them out, but there is a thin layer of seal/glue
 still stuck to the sealing surface.  Is there a good way to get this off
 without wrecking the paint?
  &gt;&gt;

When replacing window seal I removed old headliner glue with carb cleaner- 
that may work for you- they probably use dthe same glue.  It didn't damage 
the OG paint on my bus
