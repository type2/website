Subject: double cab bed replacement

I know there was a thread earlier regarding replacement bed panels and it
ended up that someone makes these???

Who were they and are they a reasonable replacement?

My double cab just got back from being bead blasted and it might be easier
to replace a small portion than to spend the time doing it by hand....

Any thoughts anybody?

59 double cab... currently all shiney metal!
