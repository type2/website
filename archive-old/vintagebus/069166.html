Subject: 59 panel questions

I just bought a 59 panel,with an excellent rust free Texas body .The rear
end has been taken apart. It has the torsion bar and tube in place,but is
missing the spring plates,covers,transaxle,etc...
  I have access to parts busses (56,61,65) with all necessary parts. What I
don't know is :

1.   Which year(s) of spring plates will fit my bar and tube, and which of
these will work best in my application?

2.  Apparently a big nut tranny will fit,but what if any mods will be
required to make it fit and shift correctly.

3.  Should I use 14&quot; or 15&quot; stock wheels,as I have both.   Advantages?

  I plan to use reduction boxes and keep this bus at stock height.

   Thanks in advance. Any advice appreciated,
