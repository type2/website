I am still trying to get a BN-4 going.   

I figured how to hook it up with the brown to ground and big red wire 
w/inline fuse to hot.  Hooked up a headlight switch as a switch from hot to 
the A prong on the relay.  Then when I turn the switch the fan blows.   I 
tryed again the gas bit.   but recleaning the filter, priming it, and 
cleaning the sparking and glow plugs did not help.

I dont hear the fuel pump doing anything, and it does not vibrate or act like 
it does anything.  It definately does not pump fuel, even when I put the can 
higher than the BN-4.  I left it on longer, in case that would help.  but no 
sparkee.,

What confuses me is the wiring.  Right, so some stuff I hoave from something 
Ron Van Ness wrote about understanding these things says there are 3 wires to 
the fuel pump.  Mine has 2 wires.  This may be a year thing.  The wiring 
diagram shows one wire a ground, and the other comes from the temp regulator 
which gets power from turning the heater on.  okay,  so both the wires at the 
pump are brown.  One is screwed to this bit that grounds. 

 The other wraps under the heater and into the heater body.  a couple wires 
come out of the heater across from it.  no idea what this mean.  but both are 
actually grounded acording to my volt/ohmmeter.  the temp regulator (the 
thing with the arm you adjust to change the heat setting, that theorectically 
is activated by a cable from the front of the bus) does get power when the 
heater is turned on.

 I turned the spring loaded screw on the bottom of
the flame switch counter clockwise a quarter turn, as Brian suggested, but it 
made no difference.  

any hints /suggestions?
