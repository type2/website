Subject: Re: [VB] Steering Box - Bus Boys Disappointment
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey Thom

.. locking columns are nice.  sorry about the disapointment on the quality of the rebuildt one.   I think they charge that much for core cause they really want cores to keep building them, and I am sure they agree a core box isn't worth $150, they just want a core sent back, if they charged $20 core who would bother?

I got a rebuildt one from Wolfgang, nice smooth motion, though I have not yet put it in the bus.  They also charge a significant core.  Steve says he would charge his mother a core charge, because they want the cores.
 
 I have a box of NOS steering lock collars, the piece that must be welded onto the column inside the tube for the lock mechanism to hold the column/wheel from turning.  Assembly required, and a hole would have to be cut into the tube for the lock's tongue.   Usually the used ones have wear from the wheel being turned and banged while the steering lock is locked.  For anyone wanting to rebuild one and make it locking...
 
Clara

&gt; &gt; torqued.   I bent over and ponied up the $350, plus $150 core (c'mon, how
&gt; &gt; much is a core really worth?) for a brazilian locking column box.  I get
&gt; &gt; this thing in the mail today, which has some funky &quot;hammerite&quot; finish or
&gt; &gt; something - looks like stucco, and the threads for the steering wheel are
&gt; &gt; buggered beyond belief!  If you are going to take $350 (plus $150 core)
&gt; &gt; the LEAST you can do is run a freakin' die over the threads!
