Colleagues,

I managed to get the pressure off my brake switch yesterday when the
rain clouds went away and it warmed up.  After that I decided to remove
the foam rubber insulation the PO/s had installed under the wood panels.
 Fortunately there was no rust.  

I noticed that over the years, several panels had been installed, to
wit:  the numerous screw holes that had been drilled.  I am wondering if
I can get away with just soldering them in with a soldering gun to
prevent drawing moisture through them after I visquine.  Any reason why
this wouldn't work or is otherwise not a good idea?
