Subject: Owner's manual folders

I was wondering if anyone has one those owner's manual vinyl folders from &quot;Competition Motors&quot; in CA?  I've been looking for a while but that particular one has eluded me.  I'd like to find one for my Bus.  I have others to trade, including several German-dealer embossed Westy ones (bigger and have more pockets).  I'm insane so I'd trade 2 for 1.  I have $ too.

TIA,
Everett Barnes
'55 Bus
