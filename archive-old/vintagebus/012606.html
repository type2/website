Hi Michael!
For a low budget engine run in stand....
I recommend using a wooden pallet (skid)on the floor, and a
transmision bolted to the engine for the starter side.
I use half of a trans that i cut the started housing side out of and
put the engine on the skid as I hate the vibrations of a stand or the
concrete floor. Also, the skid may allow more airflow as the engine
is held of the floor.

my ICQ# is 4652936

&gt;It would therefore make sense to build and then run it on a stand.
&gt;Problem is I dont own one and have pretty much run out of budget to
buy
&gt;one (funds committed to other important stuff like tyres and license
&gt;fees etc.) so I would like to weld one up.
&gt;
&gt;Do any of you out there have a plan or failing that some advice on
&gt;building one? &gt;
&gt;TIA
