Sounds like a great idea.  Has Anyone tried to weld one with a low heat wire
feed.  I have the welder and was going to fix my clip in the next couple of
days, however if the welder method doesn't work I want to know before I get
started.

Subject: [VB] Fixing broken hubcap clips.

Tonight I spent a little time getting the bus prepped for the trip to
the
OVWC campout and show this weekend.  I needed to change the oil so some
20w-50 was added now that we are in the hot summer months here in
Nebraska
and I'm anticipating a trip to Colorado.  Pulling mountains with hot
temps
will surely drive my 1776 bonkers so I figure some 20w-50 will do a good
job
protecting it.

I changed the oil filter and by feel it was doing it's job.

Next was the hubcap clip repair (the part you've been waiting for.)  Now
of
course this applies to the wide 5 lug rims on my 1967 bus but would
include
any VW rim that was wide 5 and used the clips.  Terry Wolfe in Omaha
gave me
the idea of using a bolt and nut to fix the clip with.  Of course for
those
in the know, trying to use just any old bolt will result in a rim that
will
not sit square on the drum once installed.  I found a couple of shallow
tapered head machines screws in the old Folgers coffee can that I keep
years
worth of misc fasteners - a collection which my dad started and I
continued.
I of course had to carefully chisel off the old broken clip and rivet.
Next
was taking a larger drill bit and drilling a slight taper in the
existing
hole.  If you drill too deep, you'll bore a big hole clear through -
can't
have that.  Finally, the new clip was installed with the nut bolt and a
little loctite.

I ruined the powder coated finish around the clip so a word of advice to
all
of you - when you paint or powder coat your rims, it's almost sure as
snot
that you will eventually have one break.  Do yourself a BIG favour and
have
the rims prepped without the clips.  I was big on having mine done with
the
clips and sure, it looks nice but when a clip breaks, you're stuck like
me.
In all seriousness, on my next set of rims, I will chisel off all the
old
rusty clips, chuck the rivets in the new set, and bolt on all the new
clips.
That way as they break, I can replace them and it'll look like new all
over
again with no damage to the finish of the rim.
