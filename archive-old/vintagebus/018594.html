Unlikely.  What weight engine oil are you using?  At those temps,
you'll want something pretty lightweight.  Also, it's entirely
possible that the timing is having problems.  Check it again.  If it's
off, make sure your distributor bracket is actually holding the
distributor in place, and that the points plate is solidly locked
down.  Wouldn't hurt to re-oil the wick in the distributor, but that
going dry has other symptoms - that's just a while-you're-there thing.
