I'm once again trying to fill in gaps on my wiring diagrams page.  I just
went in and did some re-vamping and correction to some existing labels, but
I could really use more diagrams.

I need more type3 and bug diagrams, preferably the factory ones.  I'm also
looking for very high res scans, so they print well.  Don't worry about
color correction and all that - I can do that.

Check out the page, and if you have a diagram that I don't have, please
scan it in as high of a resolution as you can, and email it to me!
