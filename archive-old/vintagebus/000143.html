&lt;&lt; On a 65 type 3, I parted out for parts for my notch, there was an 
aftermarket backup light switch hooked to the shift rod in the back just in 
front of the coupler. There was a piece clamped to the shift rod that had a 
90deg. bend, that when the shifter was in the reverse position this bent 
piece would push on a backup light switch, that is mounted on the pan.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Erin,
That type of reverse light switch on the shift rod was a mid 1950s to later 
1960s VW accessory for type 1, 3, &amp; probably type 2 also.  Eric&amp;Barb
