Subject: Re: [VB] cheap rebuilt 005 dizzy

I don't want to be a spoilsport but I don't speak spanish and Auto Zone
employees don't always understand what I'm asking for.
So to speed my acquisition ............... what vehicle does it fit /
what year / what engine. That is about what they get back from their
computer.
If I asked for a 005 VW distributor I had just as well been talking to my
dog, they just won't understand.
