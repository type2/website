Subject: con rod notching

well, i've googled till my eyes bled and searched thru a  list  of 
potential sites stan w sent me, but i can't find the bob donalds' 
page about notching connecting rods to allow more oil travel along 
the rod. this was a vw service bulletin.
bosten engine exchange no longer has the article posted.

any one have details, or a new link?
