&lt;&lt; Pirelli P300; 185 70X14.  There is no load factor,  it just says  
&quot;Standard Load&quot; and Max Load is at 1201 lbs _at_ 35 PSI. Now if I got my math 
correct pressure should be at 15 PSI up front and 22 in the back since the 
back is heavier. Right? &gt;&gt;
Hi Andre,
Inflate them to 35 PSI!  Those tires are going to be wimpy so watch out for 
side wind areas, when semis pass you, and take the corners carefully/slowly.  
Best to get tires of at least 1500 Lbs. or even better yet 1800+ Lbs. wieght 
rating.      Eric&amp;Barb
