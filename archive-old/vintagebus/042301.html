Subject: 15gal gas tank install!
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.9905301742060.20750-100000_at_rotary.type2_dot_com&gt;

Hey folks.

I was stripping Ichigo this weekend, and got to the gas tank..

Pulled the firewall, and took a look.  (thanks for the tip on those
screws, Mitch!:)  CLEAN in there.  Wow.  Went ahead and pulled the tank,
and fuel neck...took a good look at it all, and the vent tube.  Hmm.
Looks like it would just drop right in the 66, using the 69 neck and hose,
too!

So, I pulled the 66 down, dropped the engine, and proceeded to pull a
now-crushed (see previosu message about gas caps...btw, the reason the
sender stoped working after I fixed it?  the tank crushed it.  Bent ~25
degrees, and the lower end is smashed, as well.) gas tank with 6 or 7
gallons of gas.  Not to hard, really, just required a bit of juggling...;)


Cleaned the compartment out, glued the pads back on the 69 tank, and stuck
it up in, for the first of a few dozen installs/test fits.;)

To make the 69 filler neck work, I had to bend the mounting flange back
(towards the inside of the bus) along the top half (from the top two bolt
slots up..).  It still doesnt sit at the same angle as in the 69, OR as
the 66, but it works.  Secured it with large washers and bolts clamping it
to the &quot;housing&quot; around the filler neck.  Only the top holes were used, as
the lower needed to be futher away for it to work.


Used the 69's mounting straps, but added ~2 inches to their overall
length.  1.5-1.75 would have been better.  I used sections of the original
straps, and attached them with 3 inches of overlap, and sheet metal
screws.  Ground the tips off the screws, for safety.  Install the straps
with the mounting taps toward the FRONT of the bus (as they come out of
the 69...you need to remove the welded-in bolts fromt he 69 sctraps, btw.
Easy to do with either a angle griner or a bench grinder. Grind off the
welds, and knock the bolts out.), NOT the rear of the bus. (not the way
the 66 straps were!)

I used the main section of vent-tube from the 69 (the second section was
rather firmly installed into the filler-housing on the 69, and I didnt
want to pull it out.), almost exactly as it was.  I bent down the last 3
inches in order to clear the frame on that side.  Temporarily put a
section of rubber line frome there to the filler door area, untill I
figure out how I want to do the rest of the vent.

I think I want to run it fully outside the engine bay, but I've not yet
figured out how and where.


The hardest part of it all is getting the bolts for the straps
reinstalled!:)  

All told, maybe 4 hours, including trying to chase down a funnel that
would let me pour (filler to filler) from the old tank into the new tank.
(ended up rolling my own out of sheet metal..)

good luck!
