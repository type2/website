&gt; &gt; I'm not a pulley expert, but others on the list are.  There is a claim of
&gt; &gt; a cast pulley being correct for a 38A generator, but I had a stamped
&gt; &gt; late-style pulley that lined up perfectly with both the 38A generator and
&gt; &gt; the alternator.
&gt;
&gt; Speaking of pulleys, I picked up a few extras today at Pomona.  One has a big
&gt; capital D stamped on it along with a VW logo.  Any idea what it stands
&gt; for...year?  Application?   Any page like the Dist. page for pulleys??

Crank pulley?  My '71 bus has one of these.  Single notch for 5 degrees
ATDC, and an embossed TDC mark stamped on the rear (RIR) edge of the
pulley.
