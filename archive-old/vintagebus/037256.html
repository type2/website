someone mentioned safety chains- yes definately.    An unchained towed 
vehicle (boat trailer?  jumped the tow ball went across the center line of 
the road and ran up a certain individuals bug hood and hit him physically.  
That isn't good.  be safe, drive slower than usual, leave lots of braking 
space, try to aim for time when the roads are emptier.
