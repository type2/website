I was assuming you'd rent a driver along with the crane. After all, you weren't going to fly the helicopter....were you?-)

&gt; The current owner of the truck *has* a crane (that's how it got there!), but 
&gt; he's so old and frail that I don't think he can operate it, and the crane has 
&gt; been dormant for so long that I doubt it runs.  My heavy equipment experience 
&gt; is limited to D-series cats.
