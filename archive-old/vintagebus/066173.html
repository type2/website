&gt;         Hey vw people!
&gt;               I've got a vw bus with some nasty hacks the PO did.  I don't
&gt;know what would be the best way to fix these, but I bet there is some nice
&gt;soul out there that might lend me some ideas??? If you have or know where I
&gt;can get some of the parts to fix my dash or partition, I'd love to know.
John,
I have a dash section. That is a wierd walk through hack. Was the PO a 
Hobbitt?
