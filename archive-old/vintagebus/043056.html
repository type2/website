Alright listees!  What can we do to get Erin to Springfield?  He has to
get down here -- there's a bridge with his name on it (Erin can tell you
that story).

Maybe we can set up set up a multi-point shuttle.  Someone can get him to
KC, then someone else can get him close to here and we can come get him.
He may have to stay here though, as I'm not sure we could get him back.

Help!

&gt; Well good grief - as soon as the plans were made, they got yoinked!  I got a
&gt; call from my buddy Dan tonight and he's not going to be able to go to the
&gt; Springfield show.  My plans were to ride with him down there, use his tent,
&gt; and campout at the KOA.  So right now my options are 1) drive down there by
&gt; myself  2)find a listee to go with  3)go to the Omaha show  4) don't go at
&gt; all and stay home and work on some projects.
&gt; 
&gt; Right now I'm leaning towards option 4 unless someone can convince me
&gt; otherwise. :-(
