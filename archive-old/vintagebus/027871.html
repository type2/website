Subject: RE: Vent wing seal:an easier way

The best way I've found to seal the vent wings is to not use a rubber
seal at all.

I've had to replace about 4 of the vent wing handles in the last 6
months.

I found the best thing to use is a seal that the window guys use. Go by
the local autoglass
shop and tell the guy what you are doing.  He has this roll of seal just
for that kind of application.  It's like a tar paper but with a little
more moisture in it. My local guy gave
me about 6 feet of the stuff for free just to take a look at my bus.

By putting on a little kerosene or mineral spirits, the tars in the
paper become slippery, and
you can just ease the window in the frame.  Since it is petro based, it
can be a little messy,
but it does clean up quickly with a bug and tar remover.  I did mine by
hand, without a clamp
or without removing the window from the door.  Once it's in it doesn't
shrink, so it can be
trimmed immediately, it cuts easily with a razorblade.  If you cut it
with an angle, like the
manual says, there is no shrinkage below the frame and the angle throws
water away from
the seal.

Works pretty good over all.
