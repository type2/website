Subject: Re: [VB] manifold gasket help

i was told seam DOWN - if the seam is UP, any misalignment at the mating
surface between manifold and gasket might cause part of the seam to 'roll'
but not others, leading to an imperfect seal; down, the  gasket top will
deform to conform to the manifold mating surface.
its hard to explain, but think of that gasket as a tube with a seam in it -
if you misalign the manifold with the seam UP, you can crush one SIDE of
the tube, and not the other. with it down, the head is a much more stable
'anvil' and less likely to crush one side of the seam more than the other.

anyways, i've seen quite a few like that.
