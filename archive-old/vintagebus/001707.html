Hi gang,

The pics of my bus are on line:

http://www.goldenacres_dot_net/jeff/bus.htm

It would be great if y'all  would take a look and tell me what 
you think. Worth 800 bucks (minus the 100 I got for the z-bed)?
Worth restoring? ( I'm inclined to think so). I've decided
to restore &quot;Hank&quot; to his original splendor- I've started
by doing a tune-up, next it's on to the brakes and front end.
what about that rust? pretty nasty eh? From looking at
the pictures can you tell if it's something a neophyte 
can/should try and tackle. Any advice on where to
start and how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Jeff Golden
