&gt; Ok I have posted this before but I will try one last time before I just
&gt; install them in my crewcab and find a cash seller of a middle seat.
&gt; I have a set of 68-79 ambulance fans that I want to trade for a middle
seat
&gt; for my 63 samba
&gt; The fans work great with the covers and gaskets.
&gt; ---These are the ones that install in the duct work below the dash--
&gt; Believe it or not these are suppose to be rarer than the split window bus
&gt; Ambulance fans.
&gt; I'll give it until next Saturday....Any Takers???
&gt; Sorry only a correct style seat considered. No vanogen, bay window, ch*%y
or
&gt; ?? type please.
&gt;
