well, i'd say a 58 or 59 double cab with safaris that someone put a chrome 
ashtray in, two left cab door sliding window latches, and chrome wing window 
latches, though commercials came with painted black ones.  These are not 
really parts that would have come off one car when new.  so the year and 
model is a guess by the pop out window latch (although there are more than 
needed for a truck) and the taillight ring and the inner cargo door handle.
