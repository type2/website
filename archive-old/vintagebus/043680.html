&gt;My bus is currently 6 volt, [...] the only [carbs] available have a 
&gt;12volt electric choke...anyone have any experience with running these
&gt;on a 6volt bus?

I've never done this, but the 12V choke element would kinda-sorta work
on the 6V system.  It won't blow up or start a fire, it just won't work
that well.  By Ohm's Law, halving the voltage across a resistance
(the choke heater element) quarters the power dissipated in that
resistance.  In other words, the choke will take about four times as
long to heat up on 6v as it will on 12v.  Your choke will stay on
longer and you will run rich for longer...you may be able to compensate
a little by adjusting it (turning the element holder) but I don't think
you'll have enough adjustment to really make it work well.

If I remember right, the 6v element on the 28-PICT-1 on my '64 Bus is
the same size as the 12v element on the 34-PICT-3 on my Dad's '74 Bug.
So you may just be able to swap in the element from your current carb.
It still may not be exactly &quot;right&quot;, but at least it will heat up at
a rate much closer to normal and you would probably have more luck with
getting it to run well by adjusting it.

I hope this helps!
