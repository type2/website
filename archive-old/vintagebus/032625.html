i carry just about any tool i may need to rebuild or fix anything on the
bus, minus the tranny itself.  i have pullers of all kinds and specialty
applications, and all socket/wrench sizes for everything on the entire
vehicle.  i usually have a large floorjack, but right now it is broken.  i
also carry a large plastic crate full of every imagineable spare part--all
wheelbearings and reduction box bearings (enough to do the entire car if
they all went at once), generator bearings, an extra oil cooler, a spare
generator (complete), spare coil, spare carbs, brake cylinder kits, fuel
pumps and rebuild kits, brake hoses, triplicates of all needed gaskets and
seals, fuses, bulbs, even a few distributors too.  one thing i hardly hear
anyone mention is an OIL PRESSURE SENDER.  if this starts to leak or
breaks, you're dead in the water.  carry a spare!  i also carry a
tach/dwell meter, a MAC oil pressure gauge, compression gauge, and a
volt/ohm meter. i've even carried spare tie rod assemblies when i used to
go to Utah alot. plus the usual dash tray full of hose clamps, generator
brushes, wire brushes, screws, spare lengths of wire and terminal ends.  to
me it's better safe than stranded.  i'd rather have to fix my bus on the
side of the road than have to pay to have it towed to an unknown shop and
&quot;fixed&quot; by a local &quot;expert&quot;.

&gt; I bet there's a lot of other stuff I am not thinking of. Please fill
&gt; me in so I don't need to go bugging the AIRS types along the way. They
&gt; will appreciate it, and so will I,
