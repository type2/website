 Brakes are an important thing that is often overlooked.  Not only would I change out that MC, but I would check and replace all lines and hoses that look the least bit questionable.  I was lucky early this year like yourself.  The PO of the Pritschenwagen had replaced aparrently every line and hose on the truck except the longest one that runs along the frame.  I was extremely lucky because it decided to pop in my alley at 5mph (it rusted through at a clamp that holds it to the frame).  The night before I had picked up a friend at O'Hare and I had him and my daughter propelled at full speed on the Kennedy Expressway, with a broken parking brake.  So in spite of my atheistic views, perhaps there was someone looking out for us.
Eric &amp; Barb have instructions on converting the MC at http://www.type2_dot_com/library/brakes/dualmas.htm .  The topic came up a few days ago and I had bookmarked it for future reference.

I'm asking for your assistance. Have you or someone you know, had a 
brake failure, including any of these, wheel cylinder, master cylinder, soft 
hose or metal line on a VW that only has a single circuit master cylinder? 
Please respond to the list as we all need to know the facts.
My wife and I suffered a blown left rear wheel cylinder while returning 
from Jerome last weekend. We had just emerged from the Mingus Mountain 
road which is a 'white' knuckle road to begin with and were driving at 45 MPH,
I had to slow down so I was on the brakes firmly and pow, to the floor goes the
pedal, the parking brake was not going to stop us in time and we avoided 
hitting the bus in front of us by inches by swerving off the road, just missing blockades
along the road. Fate was with us at that moment.
I have been driving old VWs for 15 years and this was my first failure of brakes.
All the brake equipment was replaced just one year ago with Varga parts. This
event could easily have killed myself and wife, please respond with any info.
Thankyou,
Lou &amp; Liz in Havasu
