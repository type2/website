From the Gene Berg site www.geneberg_dot_com  tech tips section:&quot;

Never Use A Full Circle Crank
The past revisited again. You would think that people would get smart enough
to do a little research before they buy their products. Full circle
crankshafts are nothing new. People sold them for the 36HP engines and had
high failure rate. Next, it was in the early 70's and these also failed. In
fact, when we did the testing on them and had high degrees of case damage we
actually set-up and machined them into a counterweighted crank. This helped
considerably, however, other problems arose with the quality of these cranks
and the company went out of business.
What you must realize is that this actually makes the crank worse than it
was stock. Properly counterweighting means that weight must be added to
oppose the weight of the rod and rod journal. Simply put it like a teeter
tauter, to oppose a heavier person on the other end, you move the center of
the board closer to the lighter person to gain leverage. Since we cannot
move the crankshaft centerline we must add weight to the other side to help
offset the rod journal side of the crankshaft.
We spent a large amount of time and money to get the correct combination
that would still fit in the case, providing more engine life than anyone on
the planet.&quot;
If I remember correctly Bill Fisher does recommend full circle cranks
either. 
I use a C/W crank and have a very smooth engine, not a Berg crank though.  I
would like to get a Berg lightened flywheel and Equalizer pulley in the
future though to balance the front and rear a little better.

From my observations on the list the C/W crank has very good ratings from
everyone that has tried them.  Berg and Mark Steven's are noted for good
quality. 


Good Luck,

&quot;The tax man strode into most American lives after the bombing of Pearl
Harbor. To raise a war chest, income taxes - once reserved for the rich -
were extended to all Americans for the first time in history. The expanded
tax was supposed to be temporary, ending with the war.&quot;
Support the FLAT TAX movement.  And shutdown the un-Constitutional and
unfair IRS.
