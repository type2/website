Subject: Re: [VB] oil pressure guage question

&gt;I've got an old oil pressure guage sitting here with a small amount
&gt;of metal tubing, and a fitting for the oil pressure switch area on
&gt;the engine... (SNIP) Are all oil pressure guages like this? Does
&gt;the pressure go right into the guage? Or do they have some other kind
&gt;of sender that just sends electrical reading the guage? If not, you'd
&gt;have to run a lot of tubing from the engine to the front of the bus
&gt;where the guage would be...wouldn't you. Seems like a long way to go.
&gt;Rex


beetle ones like that have a plastic (or better, metal) tube that goes up
front. not too far on a bug.
many old bus dudes mounted the gauge on the rear window or back seat,
facing front; you'd look in the rearview mirror to see the pressure.
electric ones generate a signal in the can you screw in the oilpressure
port; this signal is what the gauge sees.

FWIW: if you use the tube type, get a metal tube; plastic can stretch,
distorting your readings... they can also break, spilling your oil.
having said that, the electric ones are generally not as accurate.
