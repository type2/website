Subject: I give up.... Blinker light problems

Hi All,

I'm swallowing my pride and asking an electronics question.  I thought this
was one of the simplest systems I've worked on, but...

When I bought my 67 bus, the blinkers worked and the wipers worked on two
speeds.   I had to disconnect the dash for painting, and no matter how many
times I've compared the wires to the schematic in Type2_dot_com's archives, I
can't find anything out of place. I have tested continuity from the flasher
unit through each bulb to ground.

The wipers now run on one speed and the blinkers/flasher will not work. The
blinkers do not come on solid, by the way, there seems to be no power,
though there is power to the flasher unit.

I replaced the flasher with another used on with no change.  I was told
there was a jumper required and I nodded my head, but now realize I was
remembering the jumper on the headlight relay.

I have a volt/ohm meter and know how to use it, so please tell me what I may
be missing.

Thanks!

Clark
