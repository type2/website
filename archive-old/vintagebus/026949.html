  I made a bunk for our '99 North American Tour (38 
states in 3 months), which we now use for weekend 
fishing trips. It was designed with a few things in 
mind: maximize space, comfort, and dissasembly when not 
in use.
  It is basically a wooden platform that butts up 
against the rear hump. This gives us more headroom and 
reduces the size of the bunk to about 4x4. It is held in 
place by brackets that fit the arm rest holds (they 
don't bear any of the weight).  It has four legs and 
enough storage underneath for all my tools and spares, 
clothes and camping equipment. It is stained and goes 
well with our wood interior panels.
  The bunk was made to fit our regular mattress, so it 
is comfy and I don't have to find a place to store an 
extra mattress when we aren't camping. The legs unscrew 
and the whole thing slides under our bed at home.
  Without the mattress it is great for transporting 
stuff too.
  If you are interested in material list, pix, or 
drawings, let me know.

I was wondering if anyone has a Foreign Car Guide or 
suitable vintage 
publication that would have plans on making your own 
camper bed for the back 
of the bus. I thought I had seen something like this 
before? I got a kombi 
that I dont want to make into a westy, but would like to 
make a bed that I 
could put in on special occasions.
