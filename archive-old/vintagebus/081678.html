Subject: T-Shirts from BusDepot (ATTN anyone who ordered one, or tried
  to)

A customer made me aware last night that I made a dumb mistake when
inputting our 3 new Tee-Shirt offerings onto the website. As a result of my
entry error, they would not add to your shopping cart. The message &quot;added to
your cart&quot; popped up but they weren't in your cart.

The affected items are:

&quot;Crying Bus&quot; T-Shirt   http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=TSHIRT1

Toddlers/Kids &quot;Drivers Wanted&quot; Long-Sleeved Jersey
http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=TSHIRT2

Kids &quot;Color Your Own&quot; T-Shirt Kit
http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=TSHIRT3


I've fixed the problem.

If you tried to order any of these and couldn't (or if you thought you'd
ordered them online and didn't notice until this email that they weren't
actually in your shopping cart), please re-order them.  Shoot me an email if
you ran into this problem. I'll make sure they get shipped first thing today
in front of new orders, and I'll adjust the shipping charge if the rest of
your order already shipped without them.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
