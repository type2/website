Subject: Deluxe Pics

I wanted to share a few pics of my and Eric Pruitts weekend bus hunting!

They are posted on Thom's sight under Deluxe's and are currently the top
4! The second pic of the 21 window
says something about it being a 15 window, that was entered after
several Beers Saturday night ;-)

We also posted a few pics of a Tempo in Bus Clones, you can see Eric
checking out the 15 window thinking &quot;I
CAN USE THOSE POP OUT'S&quot;

The sad thing about the 21 window is it could have been saved when the
tow truck driver got it 10 years ago,
however he was thinking smart and took the front wheels off so no one
could steal it, which lead to water siting  above the inner door frames
rotting them out :-(
