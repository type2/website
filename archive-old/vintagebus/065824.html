Subject: Re: [VB] cracked wires...Repro taillights - update

Oh, if it is only cracking in the back I would not recommend a new harness, 
unless you like extra work and expense.   Get some appropriate coloured wire 
from a dead beetle, yr soldering iron and schrink wrap and splice in new.  
wiping the wires free of oil supposedly prevents the cracking.  
I'm sorry, I took you literally when you said all the wires were cracking, 
when you meant all in the engine area.

&lt;&lt; To be honest I have not inspected the front wires yet. The ones cracking 
are in the engine
 compartment.... so oil might of done some damage. For now though I have no 
other problems to deal
 with - lights are OK, engine runs.... I'll take care of all those little 
things later.
 
 Thanks.... and if anything I might replace wiring completely... and will 
take care of the wiper
 motor when I get to replacing the nose skin.... easier done when it's off...
 
 peace,
