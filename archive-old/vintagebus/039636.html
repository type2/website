Subject: Re: [VB] tire pressure confuising?


I can only give annactodal evidence.

I bought load range D tires in 1992. They had a psi rating of 50. I ran them 
at 32 front and 35 rear. They were on a 1970. A year later they were on a 
1969 westy. Same pressure. I then put them on a 1963 in 1996. Same pressure. 
Now all these busses were my only means of transportation and at the time I 
drove all over the place, my work was 20 miles away, and I made annual trips 
to many destinations. On the 63 alone I was going to east of seattle from 
olympia WA 2 times per month, averaging 140 miles or more round trip. I 
finally traded the bus this year. And the tires are still on it, and they 
are still within drivable specs, with even wear. I would guess they are 
nearing 50,000 miles at least. I mean it was 1992 and now its 2001, and if I 
averaged 10,000 miles a year, and thats conservative, we have 90,000 miles 
right?
They probably are nearing the end, but I say set your tire psi to a little 
over VW specs, 32 to 40 would seem right, and you are a happy camper.

When the guys put on my tires, they set them to the VW recommended spec, and 
assuming liability might be an issue, they seem to be correct.

&gt;we REALLY need to figure this one out... this is a big-time safety
&gt;issue!! i recently purchased some bridgestone 603v tires for the 70,
&gt;load rating
&gt;1750 per tire, pressure 65 psi.
&gt;i have been told by a few folk that the vw spec for radials is correct,
&gt;by 2 or 3 others that the tire factory pressure is correct, and MUST be
&gt;adhered to to prevent tire damage and/or wear.
&gt;the people who say to run lower pressure point to the lower weight of
&gt;the bus vs. suvs (the high weight of suvs is usually close to the rating
&gt;of the tire), and that tread wear might be affected. those who swear by
&gt;the factory rating affirm that running a heavily loaded tire when
&gt;underinflated will strain it and cause tread seperation... our busses
&gt;might not roll, but a blowout is no fun nonetheless.
&gt;
&gt;all the &quot;i'm doing this&quot; and &quot;vw said that&quot; is useless - what it will
&gt;take is someone out there who talks to the tire manufacturers on a
&gt;regular basis what THEY would recommend... if bridgestone tells me to
&gt;run the 603v at 60 psi with a bus weight of say 5400 lbs, THAT IS THE
&gt;PSI TO RUN!!
&gt;what vw said is irrelevant: that was 30 years ago. the tires they were
&gt;referring to were passenger or light light truck tires with a different
&gt;manufacturing technology.
