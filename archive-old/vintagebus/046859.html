&lt;&lt; Anyone have any insight on different heads and the need to torque more

Hi Richard,
The problem is that there are so many reasons for this.  The engine case was 
run or is running too hot causing the head studs to pull out.  Too high of 
compression causing stretched or pulled studs.  Areas on the case where the 
cylinder seat are mangled allowing the cylinders to move around.   Areas 
where the cylinders seat inside of the heads is mangled.  Even very badly 
balanced engines will loosen thier own threaded fasteners.  Eric&amp;Barb
