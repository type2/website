Subject: ...speaking of heaters, I have a SW heater

Hi,

Anyone interested in a Stewart Warner heater? I bought it on eBay a 
couple of years ago but have never gotten around to refurbing it. All 
the parts are there, but it needs to be &quot;gone through&quot; - The wiring 
looks OK, probably needs a few new connectors, some new tape, baffling, 
etc. I've never fired it up. This would be a small winter project if 
you need one.

I'll take $45, includes shipping to wherever you are.

Conrad
