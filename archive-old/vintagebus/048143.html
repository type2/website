Thanks for the parts list people.

 I seem to be able to get everything except the thermostatic flaps. Now,

some say leaving them out is a small sin similar to removing the thermostat

&gt;from a water cooled motor and that the only thing to concern myself with is

the slightly longer warmup period. I dont know. Can I have some advice

please?

yes the motor will run w/o the thermostat.

with the thermostat the motor warms up more quickly, decreasing wear.

the motor warms up more quickly, decreasing the time until you get heat from
the heater.

it helps the motor run warm enough in the winter.   This decreases wear.  Yes
VW motors can run too cold.   yes sometimes the thermostat is always on as the
motor didn't get to 170 degrees driving around in the cold.    Decreases wear.

A warmer motor in the winter means hotter heat in the winter.

more volume of heat while the thermostat is not expanded, due to air being
forced through the fresh air tubes rather than over the cylinders

AFter installing the thermostat on the motor in my 65 I was glad that I did.
I have a thermostat set up in my 61, but it was interesting to see a clear
before/after change.  Both in a warmer engine and a warmer me.   :)

The flap shouldn't be too hard to find.    I though the upright rod was the
hard bit to find.   I would install a thermostat if the motor is out and you
can find the bits.
