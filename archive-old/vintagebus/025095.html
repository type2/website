I'm having a problem with bad gas mileage for which I could use a little
advice.
I'm running the engine in a '66 westfalia (SO-44 spec):

1776 dual port with stock cam
Stock size valves with semi hemi heads
HD valve spings/HD push rods &amp; swivel feet
Full flow w/ Berg hose kit
CompuFire ignition
Stock bus exhaust
Stock '66 Oil Bath Cleaner
30 pict-1 w/120 Main, 125 Air Correction
stock fuel pump

Transaxle Setup
3.88/1.26 Boxes / .82 4th
205/75-14 tires

Cruising Speed
57-63 mph
(no andretti take-offs from the lights)

I'm only getting 13-15 mpg and I've tried numerous jet combos with the
same results. Initially this engine ran the 'kadron-extractor-009' setup
when I had the stock 4.12/1.26 transaxle and I got around 20-24 mpg on
the freeway, but I'm not going back to the duals. It runs good, no smoke
or flat spots.

I realize that the larger displacement will drink a little more gas and
I plan on going back to a 1600 single port when this engine eventually
goes south. (it has 43k on it presently) I'm beginning to suspect that
Berg was right about not overdriving the transaxle/engine just because
you may have a larger engine. He mentions taking leverage away from the
engine and giving it to the vehicle. So it has to work harder and it
slows the fan down as well.

So anyway, I'm out of ideas, I know these beasts don't get terrific
mileage anyway but18-20 mpg wouldn't hurt either.

Making oil companies happy,
