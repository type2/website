I had finally fished out the tap from the far forward hole in the right
reduction box and used but stripped my last bolt trying to use the threads.
unable to find the grade 8 bolt, I used a 3 lined silver bolt that was a bit
too long. I threw 3 washers and a wave washer on there and snugged it up
tight. The back middle bolt is also somewhat stripped anyway I found the right
bolts in RI and they arrived the day I took it 600 miles north with the newly
arrived bolts in a baggie in case. When I got up there I jacked it up and got
under with the breaker bar on the plug socket and checked em. I could turn the
weak one and the stripped one a half turn each. Drove it back home without
incident. now I'm contemplating the two new bolts and the washer methods so I
can check the torque.
