Hey all,
I'm about 6'3&quot; and I get a little achy on drives over 200 or so miles...
I drove from Oshkosh, WI to Detroit, MI a few weeks ago for the Auburn Hills
show...and I think my legs went numb around Chicago ;-)  that was driving
Stella...the 71.  I had a hard time getting to sleep after I got to MI as my
legs were pretty sore....I make it a point now to drive for a while...and once I
start getting sore... go get gas or something like that to stretch.
I have more of a problem getting in and out of the 62 than I do actually driving
it... I've split 2 or 3 pairs of pants already...hehe
good thing they were work pants.

Overall I think that the bay window buses have more legroom than the splits...
quite a bit more.  My knees almost hit the dash on the split...but come nowhere
near the dash on the bay...i just hit the turn signal switch sometimes when
using the clutch...
I can get my left leg around the steering column in the bay...but not in the
split....while driving that is.

Maybe I'll just cut out the bulkhead and seat stands...and move it all back
about a foot..and re-weld it in....





....or maybe not ;)

Happy Thursday everyone!
