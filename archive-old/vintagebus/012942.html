Kevin,

It just took me a while to catch up with Email and check my NEATO
Old Bus Registry tables of M-Codes.  According to my records 027
is Fog Lights.  There are three in the Registry, all 1963 models.

I admit, I have not confirmed this with the owners of these
buses.  If you have any way to tell that you have remnants of
original fog lights, it would help confirm my records.  Do you
have any fog lights, mounting holes (in original bumper), or odd
(original looking) switches around?
