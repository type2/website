Subject: respirator help!
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10002231453570.52084-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hello all, 

I am getting to a point where i am going to need to do some
priming/painting on my bus before too long.

Before i have always used a standard canister respirator, but you cant use
one of those with a beard the instructions say, it wont seal right.

I now have a beard and dont really want to remove it, but i dont want to
destroy my lungs either...

any of you other bus-nuts bearded and have a solution for this dilemma?

thanks,

Steve
