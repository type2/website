You know, I had needed one of these too. I yanked one off of a 1300cc
engine I had. But it didn't fit quite right. I made it work, but wouldn't
mind having one that'll do the job better.
My engine is a '75 1600cc. I don't know what the fan shroud is off of. But
the air cleaner is the one that belongs with the bus.
So are the little brackets different from different engines?
