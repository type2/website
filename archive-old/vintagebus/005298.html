&gt;I never did get any responses to my question so I will try again.  I was
&gt;wondering if anybody has those pod things in their tubing that goes from
&gt;the heat exchangers to the vehicle.  I also wondered if these contained
&gt;any asbestos or something else.  Lastly, what could I use instead of the
&gt;tubing.  I know that on my beetle I had a hard plastic tube that went
&gt;from the exchangers but I have since sold the beetle and I do not know
&gt;if it will fit. Suggestions?


At one time I had flexible steel exhaust tubing installed. 2 1/2 or 3 inch,
I don't remember. A little fiberglass and duct tape and off to the races.
Kind of a pain in the butt, had to pull the engine slightly back to get them
on, but they were in no danger of falling off. I think later I crammed the
plastic ones from a baywindow on, using more duct tape, no doubt. I recall
seeing the aluminum air hose from the fan to the heat exchangers duct taped
in there once or twice, but they aren't very durable. Duct tape and
anything, that's your answer.
