Subject: RE: [VB] JCWhitney tie rod removal tool - not worth the money

Has ANYONE gotten ANYTHING from JCW, that's worth ANYTHING?  I inquire
because I never even thought of buying VW parts from anywhere BUT a VW
house.  There is always the emergency local part house stop.  But that is
just to get you by until you find the correct part.  But maybe I'm missing
something...

Of course, I have always been intrigued by JCW's collection of air horns!
