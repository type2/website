First, I feel not a little silly for posting this to the list(s).

The type2 list and the vintagebus list are tribal cultures. They are not 
democracies. The charter made that clear. It also made clear that 
competence and experience are prized by the tribe, whereas lack of 
competence and experience are tolerated. This is a tribe that has tribal 
elders: Bob Hoover, Joel, Ken, George Lyle among others. It even has a 
brilliant if eccentric 'elder' in Clara. If the actions 
of newbies drive them away, as they have driven Bob Hoover away, then the 
list dissolves.

The list also has an initiation process for newbies. If a newbie 
misbehaves, he or she will get a slap on the wrist. The slap is in 
proportion to the behavior, measured by values of the tribe.

If this all sounds a little &quot;fascistic,&quot; get over it or go away.

Please.
