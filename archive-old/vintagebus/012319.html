That's what happens when you use gasahol and synthetic oil!

And slick-50 must be the automotive acid; you're seeing
performance fuel-economy gains that aren't really there; then
you come down off your high and have to rebuild it...  Every
now and then some of the telflon breaks free from the oil
passges and gives you a flashback...

Of course there's someone who'll chime in and say &quot;Oh yeah?  I've
been on that stuff since 1967 and I feel great!  Now if only
my computer would stop breating...

Want some onions to go with that liver?
