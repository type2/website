You don't paint a very pretty picture.  Sounds like junk to me (no offense 
intended)  I would guess a fair price (I'm in Kansas City so the market is 
about the same) to be in the Free to not more than $500 range.  You said the 
gates were good.  I believe that is where the majority of the value will be 
in the truck.  All this of course is dependant on your abilities and 
tastes/requirements in a vehicle.

The best reality check on a vehicle is &quot;What can I buy one for in the 
condition I want?  How much will it cost to get this vehicle to that 
condition?&quot;  Add your estimated restoration cost to your proposed purchase 
price and it will tell you if it is a good deal or not for you as opposed to 
just buying what you want in the condition you want.
