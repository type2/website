Subject: disc brake kit or ball joint beam in a splitty...

I had one and it sucked. My 57 23 had a late ball joint beam in it. It
does &quot;fit&quot; if you use the term loosely. The top holes line up and you
need to tack weld the bottom of the beam to the frame. It was not too
hard to take out actually. The ball joint beams are higher but can be
lowered to match but the big problem is they are wider. I know there are
people on this list to give the exact amounts but I know the beam makes
it wider and then the disc brakes add a little more width (I believe)
and if you use adapters for you wheels you add a little more. It gets
pretty hard to get the tires under the wheel well. I believe they are
making disc brake kits that work with early busses but I am not sure. My
60 Double cab stops pretty darn well with all good stock braking
equipment. The only thing I changed was going to stainless brake hoses.
These give you a much firmer pedal feel as there is no flex and the
insides cannot collapse in and plug the return of fluid. There are TUV
approved sets available now as well. I hope some of this helps. I went
through a lot of trouble taking the ball joint beam out of my 57. I
wouldn't have done that if it was bearable.
hope this helps,
