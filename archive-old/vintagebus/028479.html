I ran into the same problem. I've found that they nail you to the
fullest, when the items come through post. Canada Customs is ALOT more
lenient when you bring them across in person.
  I live in Toronto, which is about 1.5 hours from the U.S border at
Lewiston NY (near Buffalo NY) I rent a USPS Post office box for $32 USD
for 6 months. You would be amazed how much taxes I save at the border! I
also find that alot of American companys, and people in general don't
want to ship to Canada because they think it will be a hassle.
Crossborder shipments also take ALOT longer! I guess if you don't live
near the border, all you can do is pay &quot;the man&quot;...Just remember...
everything is a gift, with a value of $10.00....

Thats my story...
