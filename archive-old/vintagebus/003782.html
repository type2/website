 Enough of the rescue s/c, any other thread would have been killed a long
time ago. Thom, get it or forget it. You are starting to sound like Ronnie
and his 55. Get it or give it up! We get the idea, quite rubbing it in how
you got a super deal and it is worth 5 times what you paid for it. I'm
jealous of both you and Ronnie, wish I had the connections. Ready for
flames, John Howard
