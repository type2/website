 &gt;&gt; The Doliwa book I have says:
 &gt;&gt; 
 &gt;&gt; M 164, Schiebetuer, Blinkleuchten vorn, bis 1/60, 241, 244
 &gt;&gt;        (Sliding door, front turn signals, until 1/60)
 &gt; 
 &gt;but the sliding door was not offered until the 63 model year.  And what
 &gt;does that have to do with liscence light lens?  the front turn signals
 &gt;would, though, being N american spec.  if 164 is a spec code, that would
 &gt;fit with the notes at the liscence plate lights, about us spec.   Having
 &gt;turn signals instead of semaphores would fit with that.
 
 Looking at it again, maybe this should be parsed as:
 
 (Sliding door)   (front turn signals until 1/60)
 
 In other words, before 1960, M 164 meant front turn signals.  After
 that, as you noted, it meant &quot;sliding door&quot;.
 
 The 1960 section of the book bears this out a little.  Apparently,
 before 1960, German buses had semaphores.  So front turn signals
 (US style) would have been called out as an M-code.  From June 1,
 1960, all &quot;Inland&quot; models got front turn signals instead of semaphores.
 No need for an M-code after that if the bus happened to be going
 to the States.
 
 Trivia: The German term for these (bullet/nipple) signals is 
 &quot;Warzenblinker&quot;, which Babelfish translates to &quot;wart turn signal&quot;.
 The later, flatter style, which I think is called &quot;fried egg&quot; here,
 is called &quot;frog eye&quot; or &quot;fish eye&quot; in German.
  &gt;&gt;
that makes sense, in a way.   
lokking for other M 164 items- there are:

headlight switch  211 941 511A (with flashing type direction indicators)
liscence plate light pieces
taillight lens round glass style (how is this diff than the ones on a 58 
semaphore bus?)
something called a 'blinker, rear' 211 945 081 = may be the post barndoor 
brake light decklid bus blinker taillights
main wiring harness for flashing indicators 211 971 013 post bd
check this out-
headlamp wiring harness(flashing indicators) (LHD) UP TO CHASSIS # 20-69 408
etc other wiring bits, which strangely ??? include both dual and single 
fusebox BDs as potentially having blinkies.

163 is sealed beam headlamps and clear glass

these from the 58 ed parts list, later it is not like this.

euro buses didnt blink till ch 614 455 - June 60-- not 1/60   hm

so the second interpretation  makes sense if you say M 164 is blinkies until 
6/60, and sliding door when it was available in april 63
and they used M24 for US wiring when they went to the oval taillights, 
perhaps.

wonder how many more M codes changed.   that could be confusing for M code 
decoding.
