Subject: Part # listing?

I have a good amount of VW parts that I've collected over the years from all
models.  I need to thin out the bulk and I'd like to sell them cheap to help
out other enthusiasts but I need to know what they fit.  I'm talking mostly
about switches, relays, wiper motors and some small hard parts (not &quot;hard to
find parts&quot;).  Is there a listing somewhere that I could look through to
find out the model and year used?

Thanks,

Thomas
