Subject: Strange sound in drivetrain...
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey list,
I had a strange experience today. I was driving 35mph and the strangest sound 
occured. First of all, my tranny is starting to whine quite a bit... The 
noise was like my starter was engaged after the bus was already running. A 
constant &quot;crunch&quot; when I was driving? I pulled over to turn it off (the bus), 
started right back up completely fine? I don't get it. Should I save up for a 
new tranny soon... I'm leaving for the University of Oregon next week, so I 
may not be able to tackle it 'til christmas break, but I'd like to have an 
idea of what's goin on. My tranny doesn't pop out of gear and runs good 
besides a bit of noise.

Thanks for your help,
Pete

btw--will be looking for a solid driver in Oregon (greater eugene area) in 
the next few months...
