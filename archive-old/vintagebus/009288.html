&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Rob Braden asked:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's a Dove Blue camper -..... I'm debating on
&gt;&gt;whether or not I should paint it like everything else, or just have it
&gt;&gt;primered and go for authenticity for authenticities sake. Opinions?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;

Dove blue is way too cool!!  My '66 Sundial was originally Dove
Blue...odd I
know...the paint was discontinued years before...but mine is the second
'66
Dove Blue camper I know of....I want to get it Dove Blue Again...Someone
repainted it and got a baaaad paint match...but with oday's technology
I'm
willing to try and match it again...the cab interior is still the
original
paint though.   Hafta &quot;Keep It Stock&quot;!!!

Must recomend you go with the Dove Blue!
