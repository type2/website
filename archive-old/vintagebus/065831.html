Subject: Shift rod/ heater tube lagging

I am intending on getting my front shift rod blasted and then powder coated
so its protected for a good few years.  
Now rear part of the rod.  I believe it goes through a tube to the rear
where it connects to the gearbox and can only be removed to the rear
.  
Once I have the front beam back on I am going to remove the gearbox and
engine, as the engine has a pulled head stud and the gearbox pops out of
fourth regularly.
Is it worth pulling out the rod to the rear or is there no need? 

One quickie - should the part of the heater tube beneath the cab floor and
backwards have lagging on?  The rest of my tube has but this part hasn't and
I think the remnants of this might have caused me to believe that there
should be a seal where the tube comes through the floor.

Paul
