I wouldn't stress on it too much - sh*t happens.  Roger's motor
grenaded, and it wasn't even making any funny noises first!
I borrowed a Tom Mink's single cab a couple weeks ago, and ended up
having the clutch cable break.  Leverage the guilt for some parts, beer
or cash to help fund the rebuild, then let it go.

&gt; mph.  Also he stated that it didnt gradually get louder but just in a split 
&gt; second started knocking like mad.
