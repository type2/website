 Seems to me that routing the gas line through the engine lessens the vibration and stress on the line. The &quot;pivot&quot; point is out of the engine bay and closer to the center of the vibrating motor. I see the same effect sitting in the drivers seat, the outside mirrors shake at idle, but the center one doesn't.  Just theory, check your gas lines wherever they are during your oil change.
