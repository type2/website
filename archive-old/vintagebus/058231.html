Subject: VWOA Trademark Licensing Program

This is very good news.

I wish there were a complete list of trademarks VW claims to own. There 
are short lists of examples on the site but it's all in &quot;includes but 
not limited to&quot; legalistic weasel-language.

They claim rights to vehicle names and model numbers. Is &quot;type2&quot; a model 
number? Is &quot;samba&quot; a vehicle name, is Everett at risk? It used to be a 
model name but it isn't now.

Hmmm.

&gt; Folks, got this a few minutes ago....mostly because I suspect they 
&gt; picked
&gt; it up from our club site.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone else see this yet?

&gt; Subject: Special Announcement from Volkswagen of America and Canada!
&gt;
&gt; This e-mail address has been identified as belonging to a Volkswagen 
&gt; Club
&gt; or Enthusiast and Volkswagen in the United States and Canada has some
&gt; great news we would like to share with you.
&gt;
&gt; As you may have heard, Volkswagen of America, Inc. and Volkswagen Canada
&gt; Inc. are endeavoring to break into a new arena of licensing!  In just a
&gt; few weeks, we will announce the formation of our Trademark Internet
&gt; Licensing Program for Volkswagen vehicle enthusiasts and clubs in the
&gt; United States and Canada.  Visit us online at
&gt; http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com.
&gt;
&gt; -An Enthusiast: Any individual desiring to promote their interest in
&gt; Volkswagen products, the company and its heritage on a website in a NON-
&gt; COMMERCIAL manner.
&gt;
&gt; -A Club:  Any NON-COMMERCIAL organization that has its primary objective
&gt; a sharing of interests in Volkswagen products, the company and its
&gt; heritage on a website, in newsletters, at meetings and events in a NON-
&gt; COMMERCIAL manner.
&gt;
&gt; -NON-COMMERCIAL:  Having no functionality to allow for revenue to be
&gt; generated at the site including, but not limited to, commercial links,
&gt; advertising of any kind, and shopping carts.
&gt;
&gt; Why do we need to do this?
&gt;
&gt; Volkswagen of America, Inc. (&quot;VWoA&quot;) and Volkswagen Canada Inc. (&quot;VWC&quot;)
&gt; are the exclusive US and Canadian importers of cars manufactured by
&gt; Volkswagen AG (&quot;VWAG&quot;) and are responsible for protecting trademarks
&gt; associated with those cars. The Volkswagen logo; &quot;VW;&quot; the
&gt; words &quot;Volkswagen;&quot; &quot;Beetle,&quot; &quot;New Beetle,&quot; &quot;Bug,&quot; all other Volkswagen
&gt; vehicle names; the New Beetle logo and the Volkswagen advertising 
&gt; slogans
&gt; (such as &quot;Drivers wanted&quot;) are all registered trademarks or service
&gt; marks. (This is only a partial list - we didn't want to bore you right
&gt; off.)  None of these items may be used without the express written
&gt; consent of VWoA or VWC in the U.S. and Canada. (What you may use in 
&gt; other
&gt; places depends on the laws of that country.)  If a trademark owner fails
&gt; to protect its rights to its trademarks, it risks losing those rights.
&gt; Did you know that &quot;escalator&quot; was once a registered trademark?  And so
&gt; were &quot;aspirin&quot;, &quot;trampoline&quot;, &quot;refrigerator&quot;, &quot;yo yo&quot; and many more!  
&gt; But
&gt; they failed to take precautions that would have helped them have a long
&gt; and prosperous life as registered trademarks.
&gt;
&gt; You may want to take a look at our Trademark Enforcement Program Policy
&gt; Statement (http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/policy.html)  and our
&gt; Trademark Usage Guide (http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/usage.html) 
&gt; which
&gt; both include more information regarding our need for this program and
&gt; offer guidance with respect to the proper use of our trademarks.
&gt;
&gt; What will a license involve?
&gt;
&gt; Use of any VWAG, VWoA or VWC trademarks is restricted to certain types 
&gt; of
&gt; use, more clearly outlined in our General Terms and Conditions
&gt; (http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/gtc.html), and requires our written
&gt; permission in the form of a legal agreement, the Draft Club Limited
&gt; Trademark License Agreement (http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/club.html)
&gt; or the Draft Enthusiast Limited Trademark License Agreement
&gt; (http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/ent.html). (These are the U.S.
&gt; documents, but the Canadian documents will be basically the same.)
&gt; These legally binding documents will grant legal permission to
&gt; enthusiasts or clubs to utilize our trademarks in a manner which does 
&gt; not
&gt; infringe upon our trademarks or is not counter to our brand image.
&gt; In order to comply with applicable trademark licensing laws, these
&gt; License Agreements will be continuously monitored to insure their terms
&gt; have not been violated.
&gt;
&gt; Your job.
&gt;
&gt; If you think you may be interested in being a part of our licensed
&gt; family, now is your time to preview our documents and provide your
&gt; opinion prior to the launch of the program.  Now, although we will read
&gt; through all the comments we may receive, you must understand that we may
&gt; not be able to implement every suggestion.  We will, however, do our 
&gt; best
&gt; to make this program as user friendly and acceptable as we can!   Just
&gt; click here (http://vwlicense.ipprotector_dot_com/feedback.asp) to send us
&gt; your thoughts.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for your time and interest in our products!
