&gt; I went with this option, but why they nyloc nut and washer, instead of the
&gt; wing nut it comes with? Is this to prevent it from wiggling loose?

Yes.  You can get the wing nut pretty tight with a pair of pliers, but
the nyloc nut will stay tight.  Once the Bus is started, this connection
doesn't have to be that great, but when you dump all the starter current
through it, it needs to be solid.  At best the starter will crank the
engine slowly and at worst the battery terminal clamp will melt.

&gt; Also why did your email show up as coming from me on the vintagebus
&gt; digest?

My mistake when I was addressing the email; I managed to put you in both
the &quot;From&quot; and &quot;To&quot; fields.  (I answer mail to a couple of different email
addresses from this mailer, so I have it set up where I can edit the
&quot;From&quot; line.)
