I wouldn't expect much of a settlement if the other &quot;driver wasn't 
covered&quot; or the other &quot;vehicle not covered&quot;.  Sounds like maybe
your own &quot;uninsured driver&quot; insurance will need to cover it.........John

Subject: [T2] Appraisers in Florida?

    Anyone have any suggestions/recommendations for getting an appraisal 
on my
so-44?

Someone in Florida willing to travel to my bus on the north side of
Orlando would probably be good.   I could probably trailer the bus maybe
an hour away (the tow vehicle is a 1960 1 ton International . . . ) if I
had to.

A pre-wrecked value is the idea, of course....

I've been gathering ads and ebay auctions as well.

All this assuming that the snafu with the other guys insurance gets
cleared up. (&quot;driver not covered&quot; and &quot;vehicle not covered&quot; are their
reasons so far for denying the claim....)

...david
