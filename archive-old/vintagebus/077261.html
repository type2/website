&gt;  Thanks for letting me vent. 

it could have been worse on the way home. My last clutch failure was
45 miles from home. I usually take backroads w/ lots of lights and
such, home from work. The tranny suddenly didn't want to shift easily
at all. I looked under checking the cable but everything was fine.
Decided to switch my path to take the interstate and not have to kill
my tranny trying to clutchless drive it. I hit all the green lights on
the way to the i-state and got on w/ no more stopping! Karma seemed to
be on my side untill around a blind corner I come across 4 miles of
slightly moving traffic! that sucked, made it home and Butch has
decided to act much more civil since then :)
