there a secret?  Should I use some sort of glue?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
Us roofing tar.  Get a condiment container with the pull off tip (Not the 
screw open/closed kind!) from your local supermarket and lift the edge of 
your rubber with a screwdriver carefully and squirt some tar in there.  Make 
sure to go all the way around the rubber/body frame to seal it well.  Then 
use kerosene to clean up any excess.  Unfortunitly you should have tarred 
between the glass and rubber before installiation to prevent that white haze 
at the bottm of the glass from the water attacking the lastic laminate 
between the glass layers.  Eric&amp;Barb
