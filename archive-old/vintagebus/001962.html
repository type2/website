Go with the retro 70's look and put in slightly aged long shag carpet! ;-)
(Hey, don't laugh,... bone stock and vintage custom is 'in' now but just
wait a few years...)

&gt; Hey everyone--
&gt; Any creative people have some good ideas of what I should do w/ the
interior
&gt; of my restored '59 panel? I had a SO-42 westy interior that I was gonna
use,
&gt; but it was for a wide hatch bus so I sold it to someone who needed it for
&gt; their westy...
&gt; Right now it's grey metal (stock), but I want to have something a bit more
&gt; user friendly which looks Really nice to compliment the rest of the bus!
&gt; This may be a bit off topic, but i'd love some ideas!!!
