-----------------------------------
North side of Indian School Rd. about 30th Avenue.
Parked at a residence behind a hip high chain link
fence. Was spotted mid-day Friday. Looks like a Scamp.
Similar to a Puck, Burro and the unit as posted in the
&quot;Love Bug Trailer pics&quot; email. I didnt stop and
investigate. did see someone peering into it as I
passed
Go get it.
