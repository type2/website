 One thing really puzzles me.   On page 32 it states 
 2.7.63  1 144 303 USA speedo now with gear change markings.
 My 63 singlecab made in dec of 62 has gear shift markings.
 Do I have the wrong speedo or were a few mph marked speeedos introduced 
 before July 63 &gt;&gt;

progressive refinements says the change was at 2 july 63 at chassis 1 150 022

your truck is chassis 1 048 637, right?

late splitty parts list says
211 957 023C speedo (miles) from ch 20-117 902 up to 1 219 510      M20
                              from ch 1 219 511                     
211 957 023D speedo (miles)   from ch 1 144 282 up to 1 219 510     M20/ M215
                               from chassis 1 219 511               M20

M20 is speedo in miles, M 215 is the 1 ton package, which included 14&quot; rims
so 1 ton 63s got the D speedo, rather than the C speedo.   

note progressive refinements and the parts list uses different change chassis 
numbers.  This is not uncommon.
eccles book  1 144 303
parts list       1 144 282
prog ref          1 150 022
well, they are all in the same region, at least

perhaps the C speedo has no lines, the D does.

however, the letter -less version is th barndoor miles speedo, leaving the A 
and B ignored.  This is the horror of later editions of parts lists and 
supercessions.  58 parts list lists the A part for post barndoors.  speedo 
was cosmetically differnt than the one in my 61.   the A I believe went up 
only to 70mph.  It had shift marking lines with a red thicker one at 48 (top 
cruising speedo)

The B version (as in my 61) has a browner face than the later speedos, and 
has no shift markings.  I believe this was introduced at ch 614 456 (June 60)

the C version I think started at ch 803 456 (end july 61) and had green 
lights for the indicator flashers instead of red like th earlier one.

I guess this doesn't really answer your shift lines question, unless the 
speedo was retrofitted if someone took it to the dealer to get it retro 
fitted with M215. 

 FWIW , my ratty 63 sc has shift lines as well.  Hm, maybe I'll actually look 
at some speedos.
