Hi Dan,
It would be best to just replace the whole front early beam with a 
OCT64-31AUG67 front bus suspension.  To try to replace only the early 
trailing arms with later arms out would mean to figure out if you can install 
the later needle bearings from a OCT64 or later front beam that the trailing 
arms use (Unless you have the 1963 only M-215 suspension option.), or if you 
convert the later trailing arms to ride in the earlier less robust pre-OCT64 
reamed bushings in the earlier front beams.  Plus the later rubber snubbers 
on the later front beams are much better designed.   Eric&amp;Barb
