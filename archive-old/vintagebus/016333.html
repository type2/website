Subject: oil temp is reading too low!!!
Date: Tue, 16 May 2000 21:55:48 EST
Mime-Version: 1.0

A question of inexperience... My oil temp guage is reading about 120. This 
is after about 20-25minutes of running.  I know that the sensor may be off 
caliber but I don't want to drain all my oil just to find out. I've got a 
print out of how to adjust the bellows but I'm having trouble understanding 
them. I don't know where the &quot;flaps&quot; are that the article talks about. Could 
anything else be causing a low oil temp? Do i need to run it longer to 
really tell if there is a problem? Any advice? I've checked the library but 
no real answeres. Thanks for any help in advance.
