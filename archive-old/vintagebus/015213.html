I guess I gotta weigh in on this 'cause I started the whole mess.

Yes, I'd prefer an original set of safaris; I bought a set for the '54,
and I'll get to go thru all the restoration when the time comes.

But all of the OEM safari sets I've come across, they're always 
rusted, missing parts, have cracked glass, etc, etc, etc.  I'm guessing
that a set you get for $600 will take another $500 in work and parts
to make right.  The only fairly complete set, ie mounts, tabs,
latches, etc was $800, and it *still* would have needed work.

I bought the CE safaris because I heard the quality was good.  I'll
see for myself in a few days.  I know firsthand that I don't find the
quality of the wolfgang/busboys safaris acceptable, and Izzy's
safaris seem to be up there with the SOTO newsletter.

Since I'd never seen a set of CE safaris in person, I figured I didn't
have that much to lose other than postage (which is actually significant)
by getting a set.  In this case, if I don't like 'em, I won't install
'em.  I can live with solid windows for a while longer.

Yes, most aftermarket parts are crap, but there are notable exceptions.
Most of Alan S's sheetmetal is halfway usable.  Rennie makes some
kick-a** wiper disconnects.  Other stuff is cr*p, like the India-made
stuff.

It comes down to a balance of how much you want to spend upfront vs
how much you want to spend fixing an old part.  I already have, dollar-wise,
more into this panel that I'd ever be able to get out of it, so 
having a set of repro safaris in it isn't going to devalue it 
significantly.  I'll get a couple of sets of popout window screws, 
pour them in the ash tray, and that should more than make up the
difference...  I've made a couple of similar decisions of cost
vs originality, like repop taillight lenses.  OTOH, I blew a wad on
a clear-needle trip speedo and some other kewel trinkets.
