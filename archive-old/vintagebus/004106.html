Hi,

Not a bad idea to have some strategically placed holes so
that corrosion prevention fluids may be introduced into the
hidden cavities.. I believe the Ziebart folks drilled holes
into some areas to applied their magic. Just put a plug into
the holes when you are done.  I may do this as I work on my
bus.

&gt; Hello...last time I sent this, I said not to reply to this
address...if anyone had any helpful tidbits, please reply to
the list...
&gt;
&gt; Do not reply to this address...it doesn't work!
&gt;
&gt; Hi!  I am now actuall in the process of removing the
rotted metal from the floor of my '67.  All I can think of
as I work is the phrase posted by someone a day or few
ago...&quot;our buses rot from the inside out&quot;  How true!  Having
never seen behind and into rockers or door posts, I am
aghast!  So I remove more metal than I planned...I'll post
pics somewhere as things develop (pun intended)...this is
something to share!
&gt;
&gt; Here's my question:  If I want to use POR-15 or similar
chemical treatment to preserve the remaining bus (ya, I
know...many of you have seen much worse!)...and I intend to
weld...how do I do it?  I was thinking that I should leave
or drill a hole or three to spray said chemicals under high
pressure into the affected area after all welding takes
place, then sealing it up.  This goes for the places unseen
that I can't get to...I have a feeling that I would find the
evil rust devils lurking in every crevice...and this bus is
one of the best ones I've seen!
&gt;
&gt; Whadd'ya think of my idea?
&gt;
&gt; Gene
