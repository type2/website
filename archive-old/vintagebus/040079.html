Hey All,

I was wondering if someone could educate me on the earlier spoon popout 
latches.  Is there a way early long spoon and then a shorter spoon until 
like 63 or something?  I want to get the longest spoons to kick my popouts 
way out and would like to now what years they ran.  I have one now and it 
doesn't seem to be a whole lot longer than the late knob style.  I think I 
pulled it from a 62 15 Window.

Thanks,

Eric
