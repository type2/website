Subject: Re: [VB] MC woes

&gt;  I have a similar set up late bay brakes all round and a servo mastercylinder
&gt;with no servo. And have had no problems.

well, that's a different question...  i also have 72 brakes and  a 70 
MC w/ no servo, and a strong leg. but the REG is in its proper place, 
in holes i had to drill in the frame.




&gt;Any hoo a freind is fitting porsche
&gt;brakes and wants to know what the bentley bible says about the angle of the
&gt;pressure regulating valve. TIA Mike


bentley doesn't say... i had measured the holes on the donor bus and 
transferred the measurements to the 70....
