Subject: reduction box problem
Message-Id: &lt;199906031525244_at_rustybus.ireland_dot_com&gt;

With all this talk of reduction boxes it reminded me of a problem we had the other day.  We were trying to change the gear oil in the 57 panel we are getting on the road (after 25 years off the road) and I managed to break the oil drain plug so that the wrench will no longer fit.  Any suggestions on how to easily get it out?  

I though about drilling it out. (need a BIG bit which might be costly)
Maybe drill a hole in it and tap it, double nut it and pull out?(wishful thinking?)
Do what I do to get door screws out and weld a bolt to it? (Are the plugs steel?)
Replace the reduction box half? (messy and a lot of work)
Don't worry about it and just change the oil with the bus parked on a 45 degree incline so all the oil runs to the other side? (no hills around here)
Build a rotissery(sp?) (any one have blueprints for one?) and turn the bus upside down and drain it through the fill plug? (Don't have my rotissery built yet)
Don't worry about it and let my friend worry about it next time he changes the fluid.  (not very nice and not my style... lets the plug win)
Buy a new transmission?  (kind of expensive)
Buy a hond_at_?  (Nope)

I'm out of ideas, lets hear yours.

Richard
