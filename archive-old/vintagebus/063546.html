Subject: I now suck!

Finally, after nearly a year of listening to arguments and searching *bay and
swap meets, I have replaced the 009 dizzy on my 71 with a stock dual vacuum
advance unit.  I must admit that there is a small difference upon
acceleration, not a huge difference in performance EXCEPT that it is MUCH
easier to find the right timing and idle speed.  So, with my new carb and back
to stock dizzy the old bus is running excellent again!  So am I a believer
about the stock vac units being superior to the 009?  I guess you could say
that I am a believer, but I'm not shouting it from the rooftops ;^)

Peace, John Baker
