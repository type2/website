&lt;&lt; There have been some who say that the dual cirquit brake master cylinder
 was a '67 only option.  This code is listed as &quot;430&quot;.  This code is on the
 tag in my June built '66 Westy.  I haven't verified if it's there yet, but
 the code is there.  I'll be back tomorrow with my findings.  Any other '66
 late model built busses/trucks have this code?

Hi Steven,
We found one of those 1966 only dual MC reservoirs NOS at Wolfsburg Warehouse.
Definitely compleatly different from the 1967 only MC reservoir and would not
fit a 1967 MC.   Eric &amp; Barb
