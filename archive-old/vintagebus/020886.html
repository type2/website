someone wrote in pmail:
&gt; Cool thought but do please clarify if we could have
a 'real' conversation if one should crop up that
wouldn't invalidate our five - five word message
limit.
---------------

Ellis sez,
Nope! that's part of the contest. Go long and biff
yourself out of the contest. It's a challange. Lord
knows that anyone &lt;like me&gt; can blather on forever and
reply to every message that hits the list. The deal is
that I am encouraging and challanging everyone who
wishes to compete to be brief, creative and humorous.
If you want to have a 'real' conversation then don't
compete for that highly desirable prize. 

OK to not do contest.

It's not like I'm the list king or anything. 

No Ogre under the server.

Do what you want to.
I support Gray &quot;Pink&quot; Davis and conserve energy and
that highly rationed band width. If we don't conserve
and plan for the future we might be standing in line
for our ration of humor and bandwidth. Rolling black
outs of digital communication and chuckles! You young
'uns don't remember the big humor embargo of the early
'70's. It was grim! ;-)

On Saturday you are 'allowed' ;-) to continue endless
discussions of which over priced, bondoed, butchered,
rustbucket chicken coop, sawzall candidate is worthy
of million dollar marriage destroying restoration. Or
do so on Friday while rest of us have the eye on the
prize.
