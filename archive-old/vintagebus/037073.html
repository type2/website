It won't be long before we start thinking about those cold fall/winter days
ahead and it sure would be nice to have a propane heater in your bus/vanagon
on those cold camping trips.  Even better yet, how about some heat while your
driving that old bus this winter?

I'm getting ready to order up another batch of Carver P4 propane heaters from
England.  Any list members interested P-mail me for details.  Or, check out
information posted at http://members.aol_dot_com/thingguy/carver.html

I'll place the order within a month, or whenever I get at least 6 or 7 orders.
