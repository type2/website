why not incorporate a tanker truck, maybe at the end to push, and then
you'd have a few thousand gallon tank to start off with!  i'd hate to pay

&gt; Hey, why not run all the engines all the time?  If one loaded Barndoor
&gt; can make 50 MPH, two hitched together ought to get 90 easy.  At that
&gt; rate you only need about 18 to 20 Buses in the consist to go supersonic.
&gt; (You should have Z-rated tires before attempting this) Gas stops are kind
&gt; of interesting though, and if you thought synchronizing *dual* carbs was
&gt; tough...
