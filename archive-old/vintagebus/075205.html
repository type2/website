Subject: Thanks for all the imput ..

Thanks for all the input .. I am taking notes.  Don't know how I will put it
all together in my head .. but working on it.

A Few things:

1)  I don't want to give the name of the people working on my car.  I believe
this guy knows what he is doing and if there was ANYTHING done wrong in
installing my engine, it was his son who made the mistake.  Knowing the way
things go around there, I am sure if it was carelessness, the son caught hell
over this.  I would much rather he say to me &quot;my son screwed up - sorry.&quot; than
tell me it is common for this to happen.   This guy, the father, has about the
best VW reputation in town.  I am not out to soil it .. unless he doesn't make
good on his promise.  Then it is too late, yes, but I wouldn't want the bad
Karma that would come along with bad mouthing his business to the entire VW
community.  I also admire him for covering for his kid, if that is the case.
As a parent myself .. I would probably do the same.

My ONLY complaints with him are:  that he pushed the work that needed to be
done on my bus behind any repair that showed up at his shop .. and then rushed
the work on my bus when I would get annoyed with him.  And the other being
that when I finally found someone to do the body work on my bus, and worked
out an arrangement to get it done at his shop, he pulled the body guy off my
new bus to fix the collision damage on my traded bus so he can sell it I
guess.]  [you see, the shop is close to my office, I bring my car there in the
morning and they drive me to work, at the end of the day pick me up.  GOOD
FOLKS .. ]

So that's that .. You people who know your VW's can be sure that this guy
knows what he is doing .. so I don't need to cough up the name .. not yet
anyway .. There are about a handful of VW people where I live.  Now 5 years
ago I was using another one of the handful to work on a bug .. restored bug ..
Smelled gas .. there were lots of reasons for that .. and they fixed them ..
tank, carb, fuel lines etc ..

Had just put a blaupunct stereo in the car.  The guy doing the installation
was a big guy and one of the times that he plopped his butt down on my seat it
pulled loose off the floor.  So I drove it to the mechanic. Couldn't even
listen to the stereo that day because I was concentrating very hard on driving
because the seat wanted to fall backwards, I was dying to crank up the stereo
.. but didn't.  I was going out of town and said this would be a good time to
fix the floors. I told them at the shop.  I still smell gas. They said they
would replace ALL the lines while I was gone .. I took the face plate off my
stereo and left the car.  A week later, picked it up .. smelled gas, but they
said it should be expected for a few days .. drove away .. went to the gas
station and filled it up .. got on the road .. turned up the stereo .. and
within a mile the car died.   I looked in my rear view to pull over and flame
were above the hood ..  The car burned to the ground .. The firemen wrote
their report that there was NO CLAMP on the line going to the carb .. The shop
.. not a back yard mechanic .. HAD NO LIABILITY INSURANCE .. I tell this to
EVERYONE who I ever see driving a VW .. as a warning ..

2)  As for the Clunk:  I only hear it when releasing the clutch and stepping
on the gas.  I can make it so you can't hear it at all if I release slowly
enough to piss off the people behind me.  I hear it just about the time that
the clutch is fully released.  I hear it in all gears I think ..
