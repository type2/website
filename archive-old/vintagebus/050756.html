&gt; &gt; It attaches to the bottom exhaust stud on the #4 cyl.  It is a  tube
about 1
&gt; &gt; inch in diameter and cut at a 90 degree angle on one end and the other
end
&gt; &gt; is cut at about a 45 or so.  The tube itself is bent at a right angle
and
&gt; &gt; has a small bracket welded to it.
&gt;
&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; Actually the bent tube one is the later 1500cc engine one that attaches to
&gt; the #2 cylinder exhaust stud.
&gt;   The 40HP and very early 1500cc one is straight and attaches to the #4
&gt; cylinder exhaust stud.  This ealier model preheat pickup tube in the early
&gt; 1500cc engine compartment requires a hook shaped piece screwed in center
of
&gt; the rear engine tin.  This keeps the paper tube going from the left side
&gt; around and away from the rear pulley on to the right side of the engine
and
&gt; to the 1500cc air cleaner.
&gt;   So which one do you require, and if you already have the curved one and
&gt; would take either one, do you not already have one?
&gt; Confused in the PNW,  Eric&amp;Barb
