with 185% coming in the last 5 years.   Typical price is $15200 with a high 
of $25000.
There is a lot of info on collecting cars but not much on the VW's  It says 
60's nostalgia has pushed prices through the roof.  But don't be greedy: 
Drawback to the &quot;microbus'  weak engine, poor safety rating-  worry car fans 
who say collectibles should be models that were outstanding when they hit 
the market!   I say they were and still are!
