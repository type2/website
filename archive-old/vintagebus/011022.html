Subject: Fiamma Bike Racks for Splitties?

Sorry there isn't a big hatch split bus around anymore here to check out, but 
I am pretty convinced that the Fiamma T1 bike racks  will fit the larger 
hatch splitty buses.

I still have 3 racks available and have 10 more arriving by boat in about 8 
weeks.

As long as the top and rear edge of the splitty hatch is the same as the 
bays, the rack will fit.
