Hi Clara,
Hmm, that is strange.  Thought summer started after 21 of June!   Eric&amp;Barb

I have heard people say things like that, although it made no sense to me.   
21st June, the solstice, is mid summer's day.  How can summer start  -after-  
Mid Summer's Day?  

Regardless, it is June, it is raining, it is the PNW, (I tamp the espresso 
down in the machine with a mag light.)    today is not good  for safaris.   I 
like my stylee  8* track player and the windsheild drips get it.    Hard to 
find a cherry pioneer big dial 8 track stereo.  So  safari bus gets stored in 
carport in winter, and driven mostly in dry weather.   

BTW bought new wiper inserts for my beetle yesterday.  Cost me $8 bosch.    
So nice.  It's a pity that the splitty bus wipers are so pricey.

Clara
