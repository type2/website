&lt;&lt; I rebuilt the carb a few months ago just to learn about it.  I had no 
problems after i rebuilt the carb.  All was fine..   does this sound like a 
faulty idle cut off jet?   &gt;&gt;
Hi Isaiah,
Sounds like the idling adjustment is incorrect or the pilot jet is plugged or 
if you have one of those darn auto-shutoff pilot jets, the solinoid, it's 
adjustment screw, or it is not tightly screwed in, or the wiring to it are 
causing you trouble.   Eric&amp;Barb
