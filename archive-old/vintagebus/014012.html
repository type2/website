I was having rust problems when I first started using the tank in the
'55, so I did two filters ahead of the pump, in series, and the second
one was catching stuff the first one missed.  Makes sense to me to have
it ahead of the pump, and not after..

&gt; 
&gt; 	Yea or Nay.  If Nay,  then where is the best place and finally....
&gt; What is the best filter to use.
&gt; 
&gt; 	I was stupid enough to run near empty and sucked up some crap from
&gt; the tank.  Since cleaning the tank is not an option right now, I want to
&gt; make sure no crap gets into the carb?
