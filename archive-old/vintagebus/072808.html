Rex,
I like your style but I hope you don't mind me saying
that you have a death wish!
Your wife must be a real patient lady.
I stripped a 30 PICT 2 in the living room today
because it was about 7 degrees C outside and I could
see my breath and my good lady wife was fine with
that.
But when I was mourning about the fact that another
friend managed to pick up a late 50's SC and a early
60's Standard bus in o.k. nick $500 for the lot
(despite the fact they both had no engines &amp; had spent
the last 15 years in an orchard) she started to look
quite surly and I stopped complaining lest she pull
the brakes on the current project, a 67 Panel.
If you need to get rid of a few in a hurry and they
run let me know.
I'll take them off your hands while you negotiate the
gun out of your wife's hands :o)
Keep waging that campaign...I admire your gumption.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
Andy P.

&gt; My wife decided to come home with the kids today
&gt; instead of 
&gt; tommarrow. 
&gt; 
&gt; When my wife got here and settled in, I went outside
&gt; and drove the 
&gt; truck around to the front. I made her come out and
&gt; look. She was good 
&gt; enough about it and I could tell she thought it was
&gt; looking kinda 
&gt; cool.
