My story about a fire happened on my way to work on a Monday after returning
from a IVWA show. On the way home from the show I thought I was smelling gas,
but it was real faint and I was thinking it was my spare can or something. The
next day on my way to work, the smell still seemed to linger. My bus has this
problem with the low amperage through the wires where the starter works
sometimes, and sometimes not. I am sitting at the light and the bus stalls
out. I said &quot;Awww, great. I'm stalled out in morning traffic and I have to
push start this thing!&quot; Funny thing is that my bus has never stalled, as I
turn in my seat to get out of the bus, looking towards the rear, I see smoke!
I reach down and get my extuingisher, and run to the back, where the friendly
Florida Power man met me with his extuingisher as well. I open the decklid and
blast the foul flames with a big ball of white powder. Thats all it took, and
then the Florida Power guy who had his overhead lights on for me, helped me to
push my rig over to the curb. A phone call later to a friend was all it took
to put my bus back on the road , new points and a couple of new wires, and
delete the fuel fiter that started the whole thing!!
