&gt; Richard,
&gt; Germany and surrounding countries have much colder
&gt; weather than most of our
&gt; states and the VW engine, in it's original form, was
&gt; designed to take that
&gt; in mind. If all the factory componets are on the
&gt; engines and working order,
&gt; you should be able to start in frezing weather and
&gt; drive where no man fears
&gt; to tread. Up here in the PNW we have mild winters
&gt; and have to drive up to
&gt; the mountains for our snow, but the trusty VW engine
&gt; doesn't balk once, if
&gt; properly maintained. In fact, that's the last thing
&gt; I think of, getting heat
&gt; into the cab is the first thing! Having snow and ice
&gt; packed around your heat
&gt; exchangers cools off the ol' temperature!

&gt; 
&gt; Richard,
&gt; 
&gt; You need to think *lots* bigger than dfroster
&gt; wire....maybe 12volt water
&gt; pipe warmer type wire....lots of amperage draw
&gt; probably.
&gt; 
&gt; And I don't think it would help much anyway...best
&gt; bet is to fix the heat
&gt; riser part of the mainfold, or find a preheat tube
&gt; and use it to feed
&gt; almost all of the intake air with nice heated
&gt; air...but bad when the
&gt; weather warms up...
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; Hi. I know that the correct way to fix carb icing
&gt; is to find a manifold
&gt; with the heat riser tube open, have all the correct
&gt; air cleaners and so on.
&gt; &gt; (This is a 1600 Single port with 009 and 30/31
&gt; carb)
&gt; &gt; I was wondering if there were any other solutions
&gt; for someone who has no
&gt; garage and wants a temporary solution until it's
&gt; warm and dry enough to do
&gt; it right. 
&gt; &gt;   One of my roommates and I were discussing using
&gt; some of that heat-wire
&gt; for a rear window defroster and wrapping that around
&gt; the manifold below the
&gt; carb where the ice is the worst. Any thoughts?
&gt; Anyone who knows better who
&gt; will stop me before I do something stupid? (I would
&gt; insulate it electrically
&gt; from the manifold) Any thoughts and assistance would
&gt; be appreciated, as the
&gt; weather now has been rainy and ~40 degrees for a
&gt; while, and doesn't look
&gt; like it's stopping any time soon.
&gt; &gt; thanks, 
&gt; &gt;
