&gt;&gt;  Why don't some of you West coaster's host another bus show the same day as
&gt;&gt;the legendary $oto meet? Get a boycot going, I plan on driving my bus to the
&gt;&gt;shows next summer, and if enough people would go to an alternative show, i'd
&gt;&gt;go also!
&gt;
&gt;Actually, the Sacramento Samba Society (NEATO) have already done that in
&gt;Sacramento.  The WX Swap pretty much killed the Carmichael SOTO Picnic.
&gt;Heard was incensed, but what could he do?


i just don't understand this at all. you want to get the maximum number of
busses in 1 place. so WHY would you have 2 shows in the same place on the same
day.  just the fact that there are enough busses to actually do this blows my
mind.  I could plan a BUS event. spend lots of money on advertising and still
only have about 10 splits.  and i live in pensacola florida.   So quit your
bitching as long as its type 2. dont join SOTO.  just kick it at the event.
