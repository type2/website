NQ,

If you go to your local janitorial supply house you should be able to get some
enzyme cleaner...the stuff they clean dog piss up with. If that doesn't work,
try that febreeze stuff.

Either way, the best way I know to clean up animal odor is with enzyme
cleaners.

&gt; Well not really but it is a situation that I need remedied.  The mice got
&gt; into the seats up front in the 66 bus and the stench is quite overpowering
&gt; on a warm day.  I've yanked the seats and powerwashed the whole inside of
&gt; the bus.  Even after repeated days of airing out the bus, when I opened it
&gt; up today, I about gagged from the smell.  It all has to do with elements
&gt; called thials - the active ingredient in skunk spray and male cat urine (as
&gt; if you wanted to know.)
&gt;
&gt; So is there any bonifide way to rid the bus of this smell?  Anyone had
&gt; experience with getting this stench out of an old vehicle?
&gt; I'm wondering if there isn't some kind of fumigation or perfume that I can
&gt; use to totally saturate the innards?  Even the smell of gasoline would be
&gt; better than smelling mouse piss.  Any suggestions from the Martha Stewart's
&gt; and Heloise's amongst us?
