Thanks to Ronnie and Don for quick suggestions!

Here's what I did: with the window frame out, I mounted the door on the
body, and then used a body hammer to flatten the pillar-side of the hinge
mount, where the three rivets are, while supporting it with a jack.  I then
welded the back sides of the rivets, building up a fat bead around the
rivets into the surrounding metal.   For an encore, I repeated the process
on the lower door hinge

The door doesn't sag at all now!  Now to do the passenger side...
