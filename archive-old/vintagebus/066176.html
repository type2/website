Subject: King Pin/Link Pin Roller Bearing 

Howdy,

I just got a one side king pin/link pin set for a 64-67 type 2.
It looks complete exept one piece.

I'm missing one of the roller/cage bearings that goes inside of one of the 
king pins.

I know if I buy a link pin set it will come with them.
But was hoping not to have to spend $100 just to get one roller bearing.
And then have an incomplete link pin set.

If somebody might have just the roller bearing or know where I might buy/get 
one I would appreciate any information you might have.

I know the ones on my truck might be ok when I take it apart.
But I dont want to take the chance and not be prepared for the worst.

Thanks Much,
Kevin
