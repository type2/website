&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&lt; any ideas for area VW graveyards.... &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; You might try 'Bry's' in west Seattle.  His address and phone
&gt; number is:  4017 W. Marginal Way SW -and- 206/938-3868.
&gt; 
&gt; Be forewarned!  While the herd has thinned out somewhat these
&gt; last few years, there are still a lot of 'dingleberries' working at
&gt; Bry's.  Don't expect a straight answer should you call and ask
&gt; if they have a certain part on hand.  You'll have to go and see
&gt; for yourself.  Also, even up here in VW-heaven, good salvageable
&gt; splitty Type IIs are getting mighty hard to find in the boneyards.
&gt;


Isnt that the truth! Brys used to be the place to go! And still is even if
they dont have it right now.

Brys and I go way back, they always were helpful, but nowdays they have too
much water cooled.
Just four years ago I needed a front end for the 63, and I was here in Oly.
I asked a friend to pick it up and get it for me. They said its for Jason?
We will deliver! Their driver brought out a early 63 front end to my house
later that day. Wrong part I said! I gave them the right codes etc. and that
(including stearing column) was not it. Delivery for Jason was free of
course! So they took it back home.
But now days I dont think I could expect such service.
Jason S.
