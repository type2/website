Subject: Parts from Ronnie
To: &quot;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com Vintagebus&quot; &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

I also buy mine from Ronnie, but, not just for the
price. I give Ronnie my business because he supplies
more then parts, he spends much time on the phone
talking about different options and his own
experiences with the different manufactures of the
parts you are interested in. He has earned my loyal
business for this and for the two times he saved my
ass with emergency repairs while on road trips......

&gt;Some time ago, during a busy/hectic period, I saw,
but lost the 
message from
&gt;a rubber/seal supplier who is on the list.

I went thru Ronnie (and was patient enough to try and
reach me at work 
;)
for all my door/hatch seals and most of my
driver/pass. door seals for 
way
better than places like RMMW could dare to offer.  :)
