When purchasing bearing from a jobber other than a VW parts house, be careful.
I recently special ordered a double-bearing for my split case.  It turned out
that the replacement FAG part did not have the cut out for the snap ring.
Always bring the old part with you when picking up the new one to compare. The
&quot;so called&quot; replacement parts are not always the exact same.
