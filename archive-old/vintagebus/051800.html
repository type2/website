So that's a good question, how do you contact Tom?

&gt; Ed,
&gt;
&gt; I got the Dark Grey powdercoat, with metallic flake.  Imagine the whole
rack
&gt; dipped in almost a plastic coating.  It has a sheen to it.  I was
expecting
&gt; more of a flat finish.  Very impressed.
&gt;
&gt; $425.00 Delivered by Freight truck to FL all the way from WA, where Tom
&gt; lives.
&gt;
&gt; There you have it!  Tom should be charging more for these racks!  They are
&gt; better than any other rack I have seen.

&gt; &gt; Hi Kevin,
&gt; &gt; I've been interested in a rack from Tom too . . .
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can you tell me how the new Powdercoat finish is?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How much did it cost to ship to you, and where do you live?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for your help,
&gt; &gt; Ed

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I just got my 6' rack today from Tom Conner.  Wow!...What a rack!  It
is
&gt; &gt; &gt; currently the nicest thing on my bus.  I can't say enough.  Tom was a
&gt; &gt; &gt; pleasure to deal with, and his product is outstanding.  Thanks Tom!
