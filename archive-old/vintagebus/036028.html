Subject: Re: [VB] rear axle bearings/geometry (long) 
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

 
.. Funny, Ronnie and I were just talking about how that works- do the 4 bearings per side in the RGBox axles really provide more strength and support that the one per side in the straight axles?   And the hinge idea where the stub axle and the axle intersect.   I don't really know the math of these things.  But it is an interesting idea.  
 
 Also talked about why the buses have reduction gearing boxes.   WHy is that?  AFAIK, it is because when they designed the bus, they used as many parts as possible that they already had.  to make it as cheaply and quickly as possible.   The same motor as a bug.  The same trans and rear axles as a kubel wagon.      The RGB set up gave more ground clearance and also lower gearing.  It was designed for a kubel, which was roughly the same weight as a bug (?) anyway it is a type 1 (I think, not being sure about wartime VWs) for higher clearance and lower gearing for off road use.  They put that in the bus for ground clearance and the lower gearing for pushing a laden delivery van.
 
 Looked up what bearings were used, and the barndoors used the same earings as a later little nut tranny in the RGBoxes.  So the axle bearings in your 63 with little nut were those used in a kubel, which was designed for not so much weight.
 
 Then looked up some weight capacities for buses, and the permissable axle load, rear for a was 1015 kg (2238lbs) for all models, this from a 59 workshop manual for post splitcase buses with little nut rear axles
 
 The 53 barndoors permissable weight load in the rear is 925 kg for all models except pickup, which is 1000kg.

I believe the geometry is also differnt for the barndoor rear axles.  well the axles themselves are the same, though the rear torsion bars are different.   The stub axles are differnt. not sure about the lengths.

 so how does this all work out?  I don't know   Any one have bearing load info?
 

I do know people who have run type 3 axles w/o problems, and those who have had problems.  the problem tended to be that the bearing would fail, which turned out to be because the area in the axle tube where the bearing seat was messed up and the bearing was not frirmly hed, and would thus get more ewear and fail much more quickly than it should.   Understandably because of the lack of RGBoxes this set up tends to have a fat motor, does the torque exacerbate wear on a badly seated bearing?  And I don't know if the  the worn place there before it was installed in a bus or not.  Have seen bug axles with this messed up bearing seats too, on a shelf when looking for replacements, short axles that would not have been put in a bus.

Also, have seen thrashed RGBox bearings, of course this is after many miles of wear in buses, with unknown history of weight and oil changes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem with using the type 3 tranny is that the wheel bearings are not 
&gt; &gt; &gt; enough for the bus.  Especially if you plan on loading your bus with cargo or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; even just people.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Eric&amp;Barb
&gt; &gt; okay,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; i've heard this before but i have a question.  Arent the bearings exactly
&gt; &gt; the same as the ones ussed in the bus? (at least 55-63)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And the loads on the bearings in a straight axle configuration will be
&gt; &gt; less than in a reduction box it would seem to me.  In a reduction box you
&gt; &gt; have a longer stub axle with a shorter gear sandwiched between two
&gt; &gt; bearings...  It would seem that the outer bearing would act as a fulcrum
&gt; &gt; point of sorts, and be subjected to higher loads than a bearing in a
&gt; &gt; straight axle configuration that is not subject to these additional loads.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; rude ascii art...
&gt; &gt; B=bearing  G=gear F=fulcrum point
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; bus setup:
&gt; &gt;   F
&gt; &gt; BGB----
&gt; &gt; the upward force on the stub axle (----) is magnified on the bearings as
&gt; &gt; it is a longer lever and the gear is a shorter lever.  it would seem that
&gt; &gt; the force would be multiplied by a factor of how much longer the stub axle
&gt; &gt; is than the width of the bearing.  Since you have upward force on one
&gt; &gt; bearing and downward force on the other, having two does not appreciably
&gt; &gt; increase their load carrying capacity. (or does it?? do we have an
&gt; &gt; engineer in the house?)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; t3 setup:
&gt; &gt;             F
&gt; &gt; ============B----
&gt; &gt; in this setup the stub axle is shorter than the distance between the
&gt; &gt; bearing and the fulcrum point, thus the force is divided rather than
&gt; &gt; multiplied.  I am by far no engineer, this is just a guess and any and all
&gt; &gt; input is appreciated...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; any opinions?
