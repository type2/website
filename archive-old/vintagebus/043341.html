&gt;
&gt;If, by &quot;main bulbs&quot;, you mean the headlights, please know that that's
&gt;illegal in most places that I know of.  It's considered a safety
&gt;hazard for you to lose your road-lighting ability even momentarily.

Also, flashing white lights on the front of the vehicle are usually
reserved for emergency vehicles only (fire, police, ambulance).
In some places, *any* flashing white light is illegal on a private
vehicle.  For similar reasons, flashing red lights are usually
restricted to the rear of private vehicles.  Blue lights and green
lights, flashing or not, may be verboten on any non-emergency
vehicle.  Flashing yellow lights are usually OK.  Check your 
state/province and local laws to be sure.

It is possible to use a turn-signal flasher to flash sealed-beams.
I used to wire this up on trucks when I was on a volunteer fire
department.  However, most turn-signal flashers aren't really
designed for the high current drawn by a headlamp and will burn
out often.  Again, wiring the headlights on your private vehicle
to flash is not recommended.
