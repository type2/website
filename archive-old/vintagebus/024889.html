It seems to me, that everything is a greenhouse for rust.
I think we should all just do what we can curb the rust population in
our buses, and just drive, that's what they're for. Unless you can
hermetically seal your bus in vacuum packed freezer bag , it's going
develop some rust. SO do what you can, and put it on the road.
Is venting a friday thing?
