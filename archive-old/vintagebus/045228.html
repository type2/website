Holly cow Dave, you got all the cool toys! What condition are your 59's in?
I searched the archive and no other &quot;080&quot; options came up. Sometimes I get a 
blurred image on that site, did you list the Mcodes?
Do you own any single cargo door buses? 
I love my 62 DD WT, It's the coolest design idea. I'll be using mine in daily 
service.
Thanks for your information.
Kerry

 Double door walk-thru panels are *barely* rare...
