List, and especially U.K. based listmembers:

I'm trying to track down someone in the U.K.  His name is Steven Nolan, he supposedly owns, or owned, a VW restoration shop called Wolfsburg VW in Lancashire (?).  I phoned the shop number and it had been disconnected.  I was given the name and phone number of Richard King in the U.K. would owns a Karman Ghia shop, thinking he could help me find Steven.  Called his number this morning and it had been disconnected.  What is it with VW shop phone numbers in the U.K.??!!!

Anyway, Steven restored a Mango subhatch Westy that was featured in the Summer 2000 edition of VolksWorld magazine.  I needed to ask him a question regarding his restoration, specifically what he replaced the plastic bronze trim with that bands all of the tables and countertops.  The stuff in his photos looked brand new, and since he refabricated all of the cabinets I can only assume that he refabbed this stuff too.

The guy that did the cabinet work might have done the plastic trim.  His name is Dave Cahill, so if anyone knows the whereabouts of any of these people I would greatly appreciate any info.

Or if anyone has any great ideas as to what to use to replace the table banding, I'm all ears.  Lou in Havasu needs the same info, and probably every other early Westy owner on the list, as the stuff is almost always destroyed.  I'm thinking an aluminum, or some other metal, is the way to go for longevity, but open to all suggestions.

TIA.

Robert
