I met a man at the Classic last summer that produces looms for VW's.  His name
is Bob Nodvik of Wiring Works.  He can be reached at 310-519-8147.  I do not
know of his reputation, but he seemed to be knowledgeable.  He said that he
can also make custom looms if yours is not listed in a catalog (provided you
send him your old one).
