David:

If you have the church key style latch on your '62 Kombi, then you HAVE the correct engine hatch latch.  The pushbutton style, which I'm guessing is what you're looking for, didn't start until late '65 or early '66.  You can convert your bus to accept this style latch, but you'll need to replace the rear apron or jury rig it with a different catch for the latch.

Robert
