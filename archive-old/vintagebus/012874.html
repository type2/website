1.Employment
Well, I guess Im more of the Hoover type... framed
houses, roofed, plumbed, built engines, welded,
shoveled cow sh*t, cooked, carpet cleaner/install,
remodeled...
Been here at General Services Administration for 5
years, Cusomer Service Rep. The place is a joke, but
its part of the plan:)

3.Bus Question
I think I have found the &quot;Elusive Bus&quot;:) Its a 62
SO-34, complete. Hasnt been raped &amp; pillaged:) 6v,
Interior is all there, just disassebled. The only
problem is the rust:( Its not that Im scared of
replacing sheet metal, Thatll be easy, Its the front
wheel wells that intimidate me. Has anyone had to
replace the entire ones on there bus? Ive alredy found
a sorce for the metal (thanks Ronnie). Any input is
appreciated:)
