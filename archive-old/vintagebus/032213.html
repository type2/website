Subject: &quot;Found&quot;  another bus!
Mime-Version: 1.0

Actually, a 1960 single cap Pickup will join my 2 61 deluxes in 2 days! I
will trailer it 
100 miles from Forestville near Santa Rosa, CA north on highway 101 to
somewhere 
north of Willits in the redwoods behind my ugly green 75 4wd F**D PU
(disclaimer:
Tow vehicle; nothing beats a hopped 428 for towing busses.). So please come
out and
cheer . Or maybe email me and I email back with my cellphone number so
listees can talk to me during the tow :-).
Anyway it looks like its got 64000 original miles, 3 pre owners all of them
pretty much parked it!
The bed, gates, treasure doors and even the body are CHERRY!  Like new,
never used. All original stuff is there.  steering tight.  Dual treasure
doors.  a few very minor nicks  in body. Surface rust on treasure floor,
batterytray rusted. Original bumpers are clean no dents. Orig rims, spare,
pedal pan ... you name it,  Its there. 2 Things missing: Bumper spashpans
and mirrors, Ignition key changed. Repainted in 83, then parked again
(inside). Blown engine is 
not orig. Thursday I will be in VW Singlecab heaven.

happy wrenching,
Aarne

Roof is painted.
61 23 window, yard edition  V10.0  (Thats years in my yard)
