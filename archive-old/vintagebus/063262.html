&gt; I did a ot of research through the archives that suggested I could put this

Usually 205s should fit a pre 62 bus.  I run 215s on mine but I won't say
they really fit.  I use plastic trashbags to lubricate the tire on the
drum and fender lip.  I have to squeeze it and get it in just the right
angle.  It might be the tire you are trying is wider than most even though
it says 205/75.  Your wheels should hang down the same.  The bottom stops
on the spring plates should stop how far down they go. Still running small
nut reduction boxes?  It seems like I was able to find 215s in a stronger
ply than 205s but most people seem to run 205s on the early busses so you
didn't screw up.  I think they just make a wider tire.
