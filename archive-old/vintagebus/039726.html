David, this confuses me because the original color I see does not even 
resemble the &quot;mesh platinum&quot; color that Wolfsburg West sells.  I don't 
believe the color around the skirt could go from the tannish color of 
platinum to the silvery color it is now.
Also, I just got done stripping my front seats this afternoon.  Their 
situation is the same as in the back, so I know the van came with this 
color.  What's the deal?  Is platinum a silvery color?  And if so, is the 
tannish color that WW is advertising incorrect?

&gt;Looks like platinum to me.  A grey might get lighter, but it wont
&gt;generally turn toward a beige tone.
&gt;
&gt;the platinum will get darker with age, due to dirt etc.
