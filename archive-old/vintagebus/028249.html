 I am wondering if someone can point me in the direction of how to do a
 valve adjustment on a 1964 transporter.  On the type2_dot_com page it is only a
 choice between a quck adjustment, and a beetle valve adjustment.
 
 Any help is appreciated.

Hi Nate,

Do you have a copy of John Muir' s Idiot Book?   If not, get yourself to a 
new or used bookstore, and get one, it is in its 3 Kth printing or so, there 
are tons around,  and a new one is about $25.  It has lots of info on how to 
keep your VW alive, including valve adjustemnts, and is written for the non 
mechanic with step by step procedures.
