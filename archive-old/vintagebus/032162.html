&gt;Hello again-
&gt;

&gt;Red and Green speedo lights do not come on when the key is turned &quot;on&quot;, but
&gt;glow brightly when the engine is running.

Sounds like a ground is missing or reversed with a power connection.  
Sequence should be:  12V &gt; Lamp &gt; Oil Pressure Switch &gt; Ground (through
switch to engine block)  Similar for Gen lamp, but ground achieved through
regulator.  But with both of them acting the same, I would look closely at
the wiring around the speedo where the lights are mounted...

&gt;On another note, there is a wire coming off of the regulator (the same pole
&gt;as the battery connection I believe) that has an inline fuse (looks like 8
&gt;amps) that appears to be a factory item, but is not shown on the wiring
&gt;diagram (either Bentley's or Thoms).  The wire runs behind the engine and
&gt;disappears above the wheel well on the left side of the bus going forward.
&gt;Is this a Westy unique installation, and does anybody know what it does?

Isn't this the wire to the added lights inside, over the table?

&gt;Finally, there is a small brown wire running wild out of the body (not one
&gt;of the connections) of what the wiring diagram says is the emergency light
&gt;relay.  Does anybody know where this is supposed to go?

&quot;Brown is ground, the world around&quot; goes the saying -- it isn't always
true, but it is in the world of VW.  IIRC, this wire has a ring terminal on
the end, and should be screwed down under the mount for the relay.  I
think.  Get a second opinion...
