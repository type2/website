Good bye for now list.
I will be leaving tomorrow for Chicago.
So, if anyone sees a grey and white deluxe with a full length roof rack driving North from North Carolina, its me.  My route will take me West from Asheville, North Carolina to Knoxville.  I will then go north to Lexington, Kentucky to spend the night with some friends.  Thursday morning will take me to Loiusville and then north through Indianapolis and finally to the North West Suburbs where I will be staying until I get a new address.
My 58 deluxe will be going to florida to be painted and smoothed by my friend Mark Rafferty.
My e-mail address will be active, so please P-mail me if you need to contact me.

I will be back as soon as I become settled in Chi-town.
