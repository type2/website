&gt;  I am interested in knowing
&gt; list members experiences and whether I should place my order.
&gt;
&gt; Also, the seal for the rear hatch is REALY EXPENSIVE! Does nayone know if
&gt; there is a good substitute available in a hardware store or something?

I'll pitch in support of &quot;The Bus Depot&quot;.  What everyone needs to keep in mind is
that Ron and Co. is providing an exceptional resource for VW parts at the very
best quality and price available, I always shop.  This being the case they are
under an incredible amount of pressure from all over the VW World and are
understandably struggling to meet the demand we place on their modest resources.

I've had my own miscommunication problems regarding payments being received but I
know that he does the best he can.  Call him, its worth the dime.  Sorry nobody
has a rear hatch seal any cheaper than he.  I can't afford it either so tell us if
you do find a good stand-in.

May the Busma keep ya keepin on!
