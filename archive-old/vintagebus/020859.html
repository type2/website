Subject: re: tire pressure/ tire markings

Craig asked about tire pressures, and what is written
on tire sidewalls.

The tire pressure on the sidewall of the tire is the
SAFE Maximum tire pressure, NOT the recommended tire
pressure.  The vehicle owners manual or sticker in the
vehicle tells the recommended pressure for that
vehicle, as long as it doesn't exceed the pressure
limitation on the tire sidewall markings.
