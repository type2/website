&gt; &gt;Also, a minor issue that may come... on the carb of the '74 engine (Solex,
&gt; &gt;H30/31 PICT, inD. BRAS), there is a huge hole in the front.
&gt; 
&gt; It's on the back - front means the front of the car!  If gluing in a coin 
&gt; worked, do that again.  Maybe use some more tenacious glue or epoxy, like 
&gt; JB Weld.

Hi Volks,
We have seen the same repair done with an old W8AC spark plug threaded into 
this hole!  Just make sure you do not try to hook a spark plug wire there!

&gt;Should/Could I swap them or re-wire the bus to match the newer engine? &lt;

We tend to leave the original body wiring as much as possible alone and make 
wiring changes on the engine.  That way later on if you switch engine again 
you can do so without having to reconvert the body wiring back to original.
