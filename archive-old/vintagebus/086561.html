Subject: Re: 6 Volt Devon Light

&gt;
&gt; So ... I have a light from a 62 Devon Caravette. It is 6-volt and takes
&gt; a 12&quot; fluorescent tube - 8 watts. I want to put this light in my 60 that
&gt; has been upgraded (maybe just graded) to 12 volt.

If you want to run this particular lamp, then the voltage drop (resistor)
would be the simplest thing.  The generic voltage drop from the FLVWPS
will probably work.  If you want to get specific (and/or cheaper), there
are various things you can try.  If the nameplate on the ballast is to
be believed, then something like a 3 ohm, 20 watt power resistor in
series with the ballast would be about right.  You can't buy exactly this
resistor at Rat Shock, but you can buy four 10 ohm 10 watt resistors
(2x 271-132 _at_ US$1.79) and wire three of them in parallel to give you a
3.3 ohm 30 watt resistor.  Wire that assembly in series with the ballast.
The resistors will get warm in operation so be careful where you put
them.

Alternatively, buy eight 6 A diodes (2x 276-1661 _at_ US$2.49) and wire six
of them in series (each one will drop approximately 1 V).  These have
polarity; wire the banded ends to the non-banded ends, and put a banded
end towards the ballast and a non-banded end towards the +12 V from the
Bus.  Measure the voltage at the ballast with the fluorescent light
turned on and if it's more than about 8 V, add another diode or two to
the string, and if it's less than about 5.5 V, subtract one diode from
the string.  The advantage to the diodes is that they will drop about
the same voltage regardless of the load.  The diodes will also get warm
in operation, so be careful where you put them.

If you're feeling really cheap, wire a 6 V 10 W dome light lamp, or the
bright filament of a 6 V 18/3 W tail lamp, in series with the ballast.
This lamp will light up whenever the fluorescent is on.

&gt; But ... I'm wondering - what about this florescent tube?  What happens
&gt; with the ballast?  Would the tube that is in this work in a 110 volt
&gt; fixture

Yes, if you got a ballast rated for that 8 W tube.

&quot;Ballast&quot; is sort of a misnomer for the thing that runs a fluorescent
tube from a low DC voltage.  Fluorescent tubes need current-limited AC
to work.  In your house, the &quot;ballast&quot; in a fluorescent fixture is a
simple inductor (coil) that limits the current to the tube from the
power line.  In a Bus, the &quot;ballast&quot; is really a switching power supply
that chops 6 V (or 12 V) DC into 6 V (or 12 V) AC, feeds that into a
transformer to get maybe a few dozen volts AC, and then applies that
AC to the tube to light it.

&gt; How bout ... the 70's westies with fluorescent lights - where do the
&gt; ballasts for those go - I wonder if I might just get a fluorescent
&gt; light and wire it to this early 60's fixture?

It sounds like what you are after is the &quot;look&quot; of the 60's fixture.
If you can find a fluorescent fixture that works on 12 V and takes the
same size lamp as the Devon fixture, then yes, you can do this.  Take
the lamp out of the new fixture and put it in the Devon shade and lamp
holders, and take the &quot;ballast&quot; out of the new fixture and wire it to
the Devon lamp holders.  Apply 12 V to the ballast and away you go.
