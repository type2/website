Like I said before, the bus spectrum is the widest of any in the marque;
you have the old-school hippies on one end, and the wanna-be Warren Buffets (or is it Michael Milk-'em?) 
on the other.  It also seems like those who do the most buying and selling don't even own a 
decent set of tools, and would cry in pain if a 13mm box-end wrench dropped on their big toe.

&gt; Perhaps I should have parted out the PITA

&gt; *WHILE*
&gt; Buses being refered to on a regular basis as expensive
&gt; and whacked sales like this leave me nearly
&gt; speechless. Back to the lurk, scan and delete &quot;while
