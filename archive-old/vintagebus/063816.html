Subject: Motor findings in evil VWBOB 1600

We tore down to short block last night. Seems as if Permatex 1 was used
to glue in oil pump, simply bent and broke my oil pump puller. No way to
get that out without splitting case. Pump had gouges on back of housing,
above top gear, below lower gear. Then found the killer, rod number
three had a gouge in it right my the index mark on the shank, at least a
gram gone. Pulled the sliver right off with my leatherman.
I have no idea what caused the damage.
Well, I no longer trust the shortblock, and will continue teardown to
parts.
If anyone has an idea of what could cause mid rod damage, let me know.
Goes to show buy engines forma  well trusted source, or do it yourself.
This motor cost 1700.00 and lasted less than 2000 miles. Not good
economy.
