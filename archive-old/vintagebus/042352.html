Volks,

Among the projects for the past weekend was conducting my first valve
adjustment in ~10 years :-)  (*Love* them hydraulic valves :-)  OK, the
basics are like riding a bike, once learned never forgotten.  But..  in
the back of my mind, I have all these numbers and am having difficulty
reconciling them.  I know it's a FART, but...

The sticker on the fan shroud says .004.  Just that, no more.  When I
measured the existing clearances, they were ~.006 on 1,2,4 exhaust and
~.010-.012 intake (*very* odd!).  number 3 exhaust, was of courst closed
to 0, as expected (I am playing here and expect an engine rebuild before
the bus actually moves :-)  I have reset them, as is my custom, to a
&quot;fat&quot; .004 intake (the .004 will go in, the .005 will go in if you push,
the .006 will NOT go in) and a thin .006 on exhaust (the .005 is loose,
the .006 will go in if you push, the .007 will not go in.  Anyone want to
get in a free flame? :-)  I know that the spec is right, but am a bit
concerned about the initial settings.
