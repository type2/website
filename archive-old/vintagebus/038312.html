Hi list,

I just returned from a 800 mile trip in my '60 doublecab and I thought I'd
write a report.

Left my house in Parkhurst, Johannesburg at 9-00am on Saturday with my
girlfriend, Lynea and our friends Ray and Janine, a pile of spares, tools,
beer, whiskey and warm clothing.

We drove for an hour or so at 90km/h (about 55mph) and then stopped for a
quick 'spit on the case and clutch the dipstick' test. It passed with flying
colours and my travelling companions almost peed themselves laughing at the
high tech method.

After three and a half hours or so we pulled into Bethlehem(a medium sized
and oddly named town in the Free State Province) where we filled up the tank
and our bellies. An irritating clunking noise that I had 'diagnosed' from
the drivers seat as a 'screwdriver rolling around under the seat' turned out
to be the right hand upper shock mounting bolt that had worked its way out
of the thread causing the shock to flop about.   

Luckily the bolt was stuck in the eye of the shock and I was able to fix it
and tighten up the rest of the mounts - they were all loose.

We set off for Clarens, a tiny town nestled in a valley in the Maluti
mountains. Within ten minutes of leaving I spotted our Passat driving
friends(Anton, Roy and Vanessa) in the rear view mirror and they followed us
all the way into Clarens. They had left Johannesburg long before us and we
had expected to hook up with them when we arrived in Clarens.

We spent a fabulous afternoon and evening in Clarens and then turned in for
the night. We stayed at a little sandstone cottage called Lothlorien which
is on the outskirts of the town. Temps plummeted during the night to what
the locals described as a 'mild' -9 degrees centigrade and the bus required
an application of the old jumper leads to get going in the morning.

After discovering a guy who makes the most beatifully crafted liner locked
and fixed blade custom knives, and a devouring a killer breakfast we set off
for Rustler's Valley, a secluded valley about 50 km from Clarens populated
by travelling hippy types. The valley plays host to a music festival every
easter and a few of other festivals during the year.  We usually go only
when nothing is on and this weekend was picked especially because it would
be quiet. 

The place was empty except for the 15 members of our party, the balance of
whom began arriving shortly after us. The next three days slid past in a
haze of alcohol and awesome food. In the lulls between bouts of whiskey we
drove about the area and explored a bit. 

I got up early on wed morn and adjusted the slightly noisy valves, changed
the oil and refilled the air cleaner. We loaded up the bus while it warmed.
Our rear seat companions decided to pack stuff in the rear footwell area
rather than under the seat. They piled stuff up until it was level with the
seat and then put a duvet over it to create a super comfy nest on whichthey
immediatley went to sleep.

The return trip was completely uneventful and the bus went great. We arrived
home at about 4 pm on Wed afternoon, unpacked and went to dinner. It was a
great trip and I think I converted a couple of people to the joys of
travelling slowly in a bus rather than speeding to ones destination at daft
speeds and arriving there feeling like one had just completed a longer than
usual weekday commute. They said that it felt like the 'holiday' started as
we set off rather than when we arrived.

I plan on getting my kombi sorted out in time for our next(and much longer)
trip as it has much better sound insulation and more generous sleeping
accomodation. 

Later 

Michael
