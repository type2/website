I

&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; People are cheep.  Bus people seem to be especially so.
   &gt;&gt;
 I'm pretty cheap, but to have floors and rockers in a bus is worth $400 to 
me. I dont weld, so it would cost far more to have it properly repaired.
     I also dont understand bitching to the owner about a price, If you dont 
like the number, and its not flexible, dont buy it. 9 out of 10 some one else 
will.
