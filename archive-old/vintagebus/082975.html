Subject: Re: [VB] Changing from swing axles to newer CV joint axles

Dear Dave. A colleague of mine did it, i cannot tell you how long it took
eventually, but the bus sits now in Newcastle in the province of Natal,
South Africa. I have made a few photographs, if you would like me to send
them to you somewhere....
