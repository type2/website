On my 1776 I am using f7 emulsion tube (better mid range progression than the f11), 200 air
correction, 125 main jet, 55 idle jet. Again that is on a 1776 so there would probably be some changes
needed. This system is running beautifully on my 73 Thing. I am still fighting the carbs on my Crew
Cab. I drove it around for a few days which was great to be driving a splitty again. I love my Crew
Cab! I just put in all new brakes with braided stainless lines and the I have never felt better brakes
in a splitty. I am going to tear into the carbs and replace the main needle valve athough it seems to
work when you blow through it. I am also going to put in new plug wires and plugs just in case it is
something in the wires that reconnects when I mess with that carb. It is a long shot but it has been
almost a year of not driving it. I am getting desperate at this point. Everytime I take the carb off
and blow out all of the passages it will run good for a day. After that it starts flooding out that
side. It is just one side that is causing the problem. If the screws you are talking about are the
mixture screws I believe Weber recommends turning them out 2 1/2 turns.
hope this helps,
Craig
