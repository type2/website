&gt;whatshisname in Phoenix (no not Everett) is (was?) a bouncer at such a
bar-I had the impression he drove his 51 bd to work.
&gt;
Earl with the '52 Panel?  He used to be a sort of free-lance bouncer at
a few of those bars, but no more.  I think he daily drives his '57 SC (fo=
r
sale on my site - plug) or he has a driver 60s Kombi too.  The Panel is
under reconstruction after being side-swiped twice within 2-3 months by
stupid people.
