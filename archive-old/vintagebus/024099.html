Subject: Re:engine out-must do's?

Hey, Tim,
Looks like the List gave you a pretty good list of things to do... now
you're going to be working on this thing until January!

A couple things I do whilst the engine's out... check the plugs and
valve adjustment... it's a lot easier with the engine out. You also
stand less chance of stripping the plug holes.

(tip for spark plugs and hard to reach bolts/nuts: slowly turn the plug
backwards (counter-clock) with spark plug socket until you feel it climb
the starting thread and drop, then turn clockwise by hand until it's
threaded most of the way... you'll never strip threads this way. Works
with any nut/bolt, especially when you can't get a clear shot at it.)

Back on things to check; I always inspect the swing axle boots while the
engine is out, it's easier to look at them and replace them if needed.
You might even want to check/change the trans lube while you've got room
back there. Clean up the dirt at the front of the engine compartment
(you know, around the gas tank, or is it only my romping in the desert
that does this?). Check or change the throwout shaft bushing if you
weren't already considering this. Check all the cooling tin screws...
they seem to work loose on my engine (mebbe I'm doin' sumpin' wrong?).
And that muffler belt thing... I only change mine if I'm already in the
last buckle hole ;)

Still looking for something to do? Stroke your Bus' underbelly, I've
heard they like it :)
Good luck,
pd

&gt; seal. Any other &quot;Must do's&quot; while the engine is on the bench? Also, what
&gt; is the best spline lube? Any helpful hints for re installing?
&gt;
