&gt; 1) I have replaced the seal on my fresh air vent flapper. I now am ready to 
&gt; reinstall the cover plate and need to know what to use for the seal on the 
&gt; cover. It looks like VW used some kind of putty or something, any ideas?

Hi Mark,
Try looking for a sealing puddy used on RV windows and we recently found this 
same stuff at a local Home Depot hardware store in the household door seals 
area.

&gt; 2) I need to have my 12 volt clock repaired. Anyone have a recommendation?

We repair, clean, polish the crystal &amp; face, repaint the inner frame and 
hands for $75.00 which includes return shipping in the USA.

&gt; 3) Anyone have a good interior shop that they can recommend to re-apolster
&gt; seats?

That depends on what part of the planet you are on!  Best way to do it is 
yourself though!  Just buy a quality upholstery kit.

&gt; 4) Need to repaint my engine tin, does anyone know what the proper color is?
&gt; Also need to repaint my seat frames is it the same color as the engine tin?

Take the engine and seat frames minus the springs and fully degreased to your 
local powder coater.  Have him sandblast them, zinc primer coat, and then 80% 
gloss semigloss black coating.
