&gt; It was pretty amazing to see a split in a San Diego junkyard.  I almost wet
&gt; my self when I saw it and saw the &quot;outie&quot; vents.


Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that VW simply reversed
their louver machine for '63&gt; vents.  i.e. if you cut out an &quot;innie&quot;
vent panel and flip it around, you can have an &quot;outie&quot;. Those of you who
have mashed or missing (hacked) vents, might try finding an &quot;innie&quot;
donor. I'm pretty sure on this one, but try before you buy.

Hopefully not leading you astray,
Dave
