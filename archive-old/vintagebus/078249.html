Yes, but of what use is it to flame each other regarding individual
political views? Everyone is experiencing the present day reality
according to their own beliefs, which may or may not be grounded very much
in reality, due to cultural differences and upbringing.

Besides, the charter indicates that Fridays are bus-oriented but not
bus-specific.

Happy New Year to all!
