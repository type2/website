Subject: Re: Electrical help on 1/10th of a bus

How about just powering the parking lights?  It might be enough to get 
your friends to leave you alone.  They do light up the headlight 
fixture, and should run off a little DC power supply.  LEDs?

But you really need to install turnsignals and have them flash when the 
blender is running. :)

&gt; I went to radio Shack and was told a 12v power converted would work 
&gt; (1000ma?) it didn't. After a few seconds the lights dimmed and then 
&gt; went out. I am not intersted in blinding people I just want them to 
&gt; glow a bit , sort of like a 12 volt headlight with a 6 volt battery.
