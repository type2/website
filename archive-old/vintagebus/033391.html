Hi Dan,
The best thing you probably can do is to just have your bus painted.  Most
common primers are not water proof even to moisture in the air.  Primer is put
onto metal so that the paint can stick to the primer which it does well.  If
one was to just paint onto metal they would end up with a amazing flaking
paint job.  Had friends in central and very dry Texas strip a convertable Ghia
body to metal and then primer it.  They ran out of steam and let the Ghia sit
in thier garage for four months when it started to show rust forming under the
primer.  You might want to avoid this same problem and just paint your bus.
Then take it to the body shop and have this or that area redone and just have
those areas repianted.  When you finally have the body work finished then have
your bus repainted over the first coat with the same color.  VW painted the
VWs this way high zinc content primer, primer filler, paint, paint, paint, and
paint again.  This multiple piant coats helped to avoid rock chips and even
when there were chips in the paint they were less likely to go to the primer
layer to cause the rust spots.  Plus the original high zinc primer really
stunted the rust.  Found this out with our 1963 Ghia when we got it back from
the body shop the front end had been taken down to the steel and primered with
normal primer, filler primer and one thick (Compared to VW layers.) coat of
paint.  Every week I had to go out and touch up the paint with paper matches
and touch up paint.  Otherwise the rust got under the new paint quickly and
started to spread at ridiculus rates of speed.
