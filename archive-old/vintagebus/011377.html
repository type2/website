Subject: Too much stuff?
Date: Fri, 26 Jun 1998 00:09:05 PDT

Ok this isn't necessarily vintage related, but I do daily drive a 63 
Bus!

Am I nuts, or does evey VW owner gather more stuff then they can use? I 
have 10 or so heater boxes, bug and bus style (yes all nothing special) 
tin parts like crazy, fan shrouds (about 5 or more non doghouse and no 
not 36hp, although I know where to get a nice one). Misc. generator 
stands and oil fillers.

My question is, I want to get rid of some of this stuff! I am this close 
to scrapping it all at the metal recycler. Anyone want any of this 
stuff? Carbs, and distributers as well.

Is there any value or is it all just old stuff? Nothing vintage or 
special, just old vw motor stuff taking up space. Should I try and sell 
it or just scrap it?

Jason
