&lt;&lt; 1.) can I buy side bumper brackets? the ones on mine have been shaved;&gt;&gt;
Hi Andre,
Try WW for those.

&lt;&lt;2.) is there a difference in rear wheel wells between Split and early Bay? 
I think I've seen like 69 or 70 Bay at a local junk yard;&gt;&gt;
Yes there is a big time differance!

&lt;&lt;3.) I've heard talk about pans to cover front undercarriage components, what
 is it called and was it available for a 64? &gt;&gt;
From the parts VW bus parts book....  211 703 609 B  Cover plate under pedal 
linkage (LHD) from chassi No.  20-117 902.  Type and model 211-273.  
  This was used from 1955-66ish then had a cut out, or bulge preesed into it 
for the longer dual MC used in some 1966 models and most of 1967.    Eric&amp;Barb
