&gt; Hi all, we just got a '57 kombi (I think, has three popouts on each side) with some kind
&gt; of camper conversion inside. Our question is how can we tell who manufactured the kit, or
&gt; was this some kind of home built thing? I can't find any kind of sticker or plate anywhere
&gt; on the bus IDing it. Right behind the front bench is a small dinette? that makes into a
&gt; bed and in the back is a little cabinet with a couple of doors. there's also a small
&gt; cabinet right at the front behind the passenger seat. wood paneling covers the sides and
&gt; roof. Any ideas on what this might be?
&gt;
&gt;

    Hey Matt,
Is there a sunroof or hatch that opens on the roof of your bus?
Is the headliner made up of pieces of wood that extend the entire WIDTH of the bus?
Is the cabinet in the back on the passenger side?
Are there brackets on the exterior roof?
Is the cabinet right behind the passenger side a single burner stove?
