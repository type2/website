If any of you bus people want to build a cab divider, I have some extra
divider parts. I have the 2 rigidity supports, 2 pieces of the glass and one
rubber seal. By the way, I dont believe the rigidity supports are the same as
the luggage rails behind the rear seat on the elusive pre march 1955
transporters, similair maybe, but not exact.
