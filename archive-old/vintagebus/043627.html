Subject: Re: [VB] Converting from 9-Pin box

&gt;
&gt;I bought a '64 delivery van that has been upgraded with a
&gt;non-(dys)functional 9-pin box controlling the signals/flashers.

My first thought would be to go back to the original '64 setup, unless
it has also been converted to 12v.  Even then, it's not that hard.

&gt;Does anyone have experience replacing this system with a conventional 
&gt;flasher?

You need my handy dandy 9-prong box write up at either

http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html       or
http://home.att_dot_net/~mroberds/cars/vw-9prong.html

It's the same article both places.  It will tell you how to troubleshoot
the box you have and how to replace it with your choice of a flasher
(for turn signals only), a flasher and some relays (for turn and
hazards), or a flasher and a bay-window hazard switch (for turn and
hazards).

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
