Subject: Re: [VB] roof rack drag&amp;howl

Eric and Barb, 
I'm not sure where the rack was made. I weigh 235 lb.(6'.5&quot; tall) and walk 
all over the rack with out bending. I was thinking that any Howl problem 
people have may be the position they mount the rack in. I have mine all the 
way it can go towards the front of the bus. I also had it Powder coated 
(silver), maybe the drag is reduced some over painted or rusty chipped paint 
racks.
I enjoy reading your posts to the list. You know your VW's.
Thanks
Kerry

&lt;&lt; Hi Kerry,
 Nice full length roof rack!  It is of German manufacture of which there 
where 
 at least two differant styles of this particular manufacture.  The tapered 
 sided type you have and a straight down sided one.  Which type was made 
first 
 or at the same time we do not know.  The racks that are going to howl are 
 probably USA made with thinner walled thicker dia. tubing.  Have had this 
 happen with made for VOA and other USA bug racks and had to weave a bungee 
in 
 amongst the tubes from front to rear to dampen the loud howl.   Eric&amp;Barb &gt;&gt;
