Subject: Re: [VB] Middle seat fit

I believe that is what came (not originally) with my
66 Deluxe that I am restoring because the middle seat
has plastic plugs where a set of headrests should go. 
I should be able to cover these to match the other
seats but I need an armrest as there is only a
protuding metal and it doesnt look very safe.  If I
left it as a hippy bus I could give it the Red Green
solution and wrap it with a bunch of duct tape.

&gt; &gt; The question has come up as to whether a full
&gt; length middle seat from a '70s
&gt; &gt; Bay window will fit into a '67 split.  Anyone know
&gt; for sure?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes it will bolt right in. BTDT
&gt; 
&gt; That is, if you have the keyholes at the edge by the
&gt; cargo doors. A walk-thru is
&gt; set up for a 3/4 seat. A non-walk-thru is set up for
&gt; a full seat.
