&gt; My neighbor wants me to buy his 66 panel, but the only problem is that he is
&gt; having trouble pulling the engine to fix the clutch. Seems he has the bolts
&gt; unbolted, but can not find where to hook the &quot;hook&quot; on the cherry picker. On
&gt; the manifold? Or would this rip out the studs on the heads? Asking for a
&gt; friend.

Lyle,
I always like to attach the cherry picker to the carbueretor, that way
it can rip off that junk stock 28-pict-1 so I can put some kadrons on
and get some real power. Or if you have already installed nitrous, the
bottle brackets you welded to the case are a good spot to hook up to.
Remember, always cut suitable holes in both the roof section of the
vehicle and also the firewall between the engine compartment and the
interior of the bus. Don't worry, a bit of extra shag carpet will cover
these holes really good.  You may want to hinge the hole on the roof for
easy future access, like for when you finally pony up the sheckles for
some chrome cooling tin and a cool turbo, or if you are really cool,
that buick v-6 that will make all the chicks think you got a race love
machine!
