Subject: Mis-fire help needed on my '57...

Hi all,

I personally had similar problems with my '59 Double cab on it's maiden voyage
after I bought it out in the S.F. Bay area and was driving it back home to St.
Louis.  It has a 1641 cc motor, dog-house set-up, dual 44 IDF's, electric fuel
pump, headers, etc.  Once I passed Denver, the increasing stumbling and
erratic sputtering at mostly higher rpm's had me thinking either crud in the
dual 44 IDF's, the fuel pump failing, some other fuel blockage, or something
electrical (coil, points, condenser, etc).  After checking everything out, I
did notice that the newly installed points were pitting quite a bit.  Long
story much shorter, only after I limped it home did I stumble into the
eventual solution in my case, a loosening mounting screw that also serves to
ground the condenser to the distributor case.  With vibration, maybe a little
oil and dirt thrown in, the condenser would sometimes lose it's &quot;ground&quot; and
not fire, burning the points and making for a nerve-racking maiden trip.  Once
I pulled the condenser off, cleaned everything, bolted it up with a lock
washer nice and tight again, all poor driving symptoms were gone!  Such a
simple thing, yet I missed it.  Now it's the first thing I check!  I hope it's
something simple like that for you too.
