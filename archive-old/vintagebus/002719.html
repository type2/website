Subject: Sway bar clamps - replacing

Hi all

On my '66 standard bus one of my anti-roll bar (as we say in England) clamps
is cracked, and I'm getting a new pair of clamps sent to me.

The guy who sold them wished me &quot;good luck&quot; in an ominous way when I said I
wanted to fit them myself. So now of course I'm in a panic and wondering
whether to take it to a garage.

How hard is it? Does it need special tools? Anyone got the time to write
some instructions?

I drove the van for a while before finding the broken clamp, and I must say
it handled perfectly well! Except when a big truck steams past.

Anyway thanks for listening

james
