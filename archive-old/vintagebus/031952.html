&lt;&lt; How does the clock clamp into the dash?  I know it has to be removed to be 
set...if someone could explain it to me, I'd be grateful... &gt;&gt;
Hi Gene,
The clock mounts in with two brackets on each side.  The pre-1962 clocks you 
reach up forward of the dash and adjust.  The post-1961 clocks are adjusted 
through the face crystal.  From what you describe from your clock it is 
missing all the hard to find parts and so is a parts clock for the innards.  
You will need to find another clock with all these parts and have one made 
from the two.  Which we do along with cleaning and some cosmetic repair for 
$40.00 including shipping in the USA.
