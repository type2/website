Subject: Re: [VB] Roofing tar type

e tip cover from your local supermarket.
&gt;For tar we use &quot;Henry #108 Asphalt Coating and Lap Cement.  Non-fibered,
&gt;Brush Grade, Solvent Based.&quot; and it comes in one or five gallon cans.

I just wanna add one thing - go easy with this stuff!
I laid in some THICK coatings on my bus; on the  side and door panels it
cured quickly, and acted as a sound/vibration deadener, but on the floors
and rear hatch area it just kinda sits there staying mushy and smelly! My
dog no longer likes to ride in the bus, as a hot day makes quite a good
deal of fumes... and I did this a YEAR ago!  I plan to clean out the excess
this month; the floors will prolly be as safe with a 1/4&quot; skin of taras
they will be with 1&quot;!
