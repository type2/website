Subject: It's Friday..Do you know where your Bus is?
To: vintagebus &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Ladies and Gents,  Well yep....I do...Ol'No Name is
setting in the driveway just wondering what in the
heck I am doing to her.I have been pulling parts off
the back end to get to that sick little engine and
also do a clean up in there.I can see why some might
give up and let them sit till the next big
freeze......I am just looking one day at a
time....seems to be the best way.The parts list grows
and the trip to Hawaii slips away.The paint on the
body(PO repaint) is sort of gone so I wonder what to
do to cover it up without spending next years trip to
Costa Rica on it(yeah right)... are rattle cans out of
style? Is there some sort of re-wire kit that replaces
all the wires in the engine compartment... to the tail
and backup lights included? My Bus is shakeing in her
Bridgestones/Firestones(just kidding I have tires from
China on her..Oh great!)          Do you know where
your Bus is?
