Subject: Fake Ebay Info request 

Hello all

No Bus content, but as many of you have been so helpful to me in the past, I
wanted to warn you of something that has occured to me twice now.  I
recieved the following:  It included the familiar ebay logo and was fully
formated to LOOK like an actual message from ebay.  If you click on the link
below, it too LOOKS like ebay, and asks for your id,  password, credit card
number, expiration date, billing address, social security number, etc, etc,
etc.

However, it is NOT ebay. It is a an attempt to steal your identity and make
your life miserable.  Ebay has confirmed this to me.  They say they will
never send any emails asking you for personal info.  So just be heads up.

Hope this helps prevent some of you folks some real misery.

Bob T
