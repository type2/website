Subject: NOS German Mufflers $69!!

I just received a shipment of new-old-stock German bus mufflers from Ernst
(an O.E. supplier to VW).  I don't have too many of these, so they'll be
first come first serve.    Price is $69.95.  To order, call toll-free
1-888-819-DEPOT, or they'll be on the website tomorrow.  Note:  If ordering
via the website, the price will be $4 higher.  This is because the shopping
cart is undercharging on shipping for their weight, so I have to price it
slightly higher on the website to cover my shipping cost.

Part numbers are:
40HP Stale-Air Muffler, 211 251 053C (B)
40HP Fresh-Air Muffler, 211 251 053J (E)

I also received one 36HP muffler, which I will sell for $89.95.  This will
not go on the website because it's not worth entering just one piece.  First
listmember who calls or pmails me gets it.

Thanks,
