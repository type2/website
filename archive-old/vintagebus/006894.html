I finally got his home number through a lot of channels and have left some
messages, but alas they go unanswered. I hope he show's at Jerome again, I
saw him at Familianfest driving a Mercedes wagon towing a bus for sale!

 He was at the last Sacramento bug o' rama getting greasy under a Rometcshe.
 I think the speedwell kids are friends w/ him.
 I think its speedwell2K_at_aol_dot_com
 
 Ole Blue is hard to find. I remember one time when he made a trip around
the 
world in a 1998 New Beetle. He wrote me an e-mail because I also owned one.
I 
answered the e-mail with a question, and he never answered. He usta own a 
Type 34 special car, but I never got in touch with thru the Type 34 registry

either. I asked the Type 34
list where he was, but got no response. Usually, you'll find him around some

Rometsche (sp?), which he is a guru on. I tried to contact him about a 
Rometsche for
sale, and was unsuccessful, too. There usta be a way to get in touch with
him 
thru
another fellow who did business with the Type 34 registry. But I guess that 
source is too old to list anymore, So, anyone who finds him, please notify 
the Vintagebus list.
