Subject: RE:BRRRRrr in AridZona

On January 28th  our VW club had its birthday party--So I drove the barndoor to the
event-- as Jan 30th would be the 50th birthday for AB VW 51--As a birthday present the
weather decided to Hail on the bus!!
But being born in Germany on Jan 30 1951-- i do not think the bus really was bothered by
the hail--as of yet it has not had the pleasure of a 115 degree summer--I know it must be
cold as i have to use the choke to get the bus started--The accelerator pump was leaking
so I rebuilt the 28PIC-- now i'm getting a small leak from the 14mm plug and throttle
shaft --of which it was probably there before--But if anyone out there has a leak-proof
28PIC lower half or complete carb PLMK--The 51 is running a 1954 36hp motor--Bus runs
great--but the slight gas leak could be a problem when &quot;Simmer&quot; gets here--TWWM, uj
