I have this on the tag in my 61. It is for codes L346 and
L347, or Seagull grey and Mango Green. I believe that this colour
combination was introduced in late 1959 and was used until mid 1961. The
matching upholstery is Caramel Brown
There is a photo of  my van showing these colours at my Bad Camberg photo
