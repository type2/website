  Hi list, Yesterday I had to rent a tow dolly to get my Bus over to the body 
 and paint shop. The guy at U-haul charged me 40 bucks. I will have to rent 
it 
 again to bring her home when there done painting her. I was thinking of just 
 buying a tow bar of my own to avoid further rental cost. How much do they go 
 for and were can I get one? Any help will sure be appreciated. Aloha Mike
 
 
What's the difference between a Super Beetle,  Regular beetle, and a Bus tow 
bar?
I don't know. RMMW has Super Beetle and Plano Beetle tow bars, which range 
from
$70 - $85 for a Plano Beetle to a Super Beetle. I don't see one for a bus, 
but it doesn't  look too hard to make one out of a Plano Beetle or Super 
Beetle tow bar. Any of you Bus fanatics know the difference?
