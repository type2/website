No way! I know Dan pretty well and have always known
him to be more of a Republican kind of a guy! Now he's
going to be a Librarian!? Pfffft! Now that John McCain
is out of the running maybe he figured that there's
not much choice but to vote for Harry Browne's Reform
or maybe even Ralph Nader's Green parties. I mean come
on! Eight potential years of some apparently near
sighted dude with CIA stuffed up his butt with a name
like &quot;Dub-ya?&quot; Cha! sounds more like a name for a
bubba who rearranges the back stock of beer in a
Southern Seven-Eleven store. &quot;Hay, Dub-ya, Y'all bring
mom-an-nems anuthah case of dat Pearl Pop wit dah foam
on top!&quot; Like, it's not like as-if Alan Keyes has a
chance in hell even though he preaches pure gospel
truth. It's OK Dan, I believe in liberty too but damn,
moving from tornado alley into hurricane alley just to
be &quot;down&quot; for the cause. That's so cool... 
Dan has enough class to support the Red Elvises now
he's gone for the Librarian Party. Less gubbernmint
and more Rock and Roll I suppose. ;-) 
I'm outraged! I say keep the politics off of the
VWlists!
