Subject: RE: [VB] pimpride steering wheels

  I have been in contact with Chriss about making the wheels again and he
has been busy with his real business. I have asked him to PLEASE make wheels
again, as he still has the molds and maybe when he sees this thread he might
consider it again.
  His wheels were beautiful and did not flex or bend like Flat 4's do.

Chris Dreike, listee and Steering Wheel Man takes OG wheels, removes all the

molded material and pours new material around the metal armature and into a 
mold taken from an NOS wheel. I have two and they're great. Not sure if he's

still producing, but save those &quot;hopeless&quot;, beat up old wheels for him.
Patched 
wheels are OK, but Chris' have all the nubs and are as solid as OG.

&gt; The flat four wheels are not exact copies either. There used to be a guy 
named 
&gt; Chris from SoCal that was making brand new ones that were rumoured to be
real 
&gt; nice and cheapre than Kochs.
