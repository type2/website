Well, around these parts, people stand around the back of pickups and talk, so I'll offer my orangish-yellow doublecab to do so. If you can't find it, look for the yellowish-orange one. C.R. Saul's Rosie should be close by if we have an overflow crowd.   How about 10 a.m. for the &quot;illusion-reality&quot; digest?  
Last year we had a dozen thirsty folks who met at the brewpub across Katella from the parking lot after OCTO. Good beer and good food. It was called JT Scmidt's last year. Lingered too long and missed the Toy &amp; Literature show though. I'll buy every listee a pint who shows up.
Here's a thought. Instead of *another* parking lot show, find a park and meet under the trees or along the shore?  A lot of busses will go to Irvine Lake, so why not have OCTO there? I like the level of anarchy at the AZ bus events, Bridge and Jerome.
