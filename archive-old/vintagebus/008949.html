I found an electrical device mounted on the frame of my '66 near the
starter...it has three heavy wires (snipped off), a square front plate with
a round body, and the only clue is that &quot;6V&quot; is stamped in the bottom....I
think it is one of those relays for the starter (shortens the travel of the
high amp/volt juice to the starter from the battery-triggered by the
ignition switch.)

Am I correct?  Anyone need one of these things?  Or should I put it on EHate
for a million...?
