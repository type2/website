Hi
I may have missed part of this thread
but I have posted some pics of a Dormobile of my neighbors
I thought it was neat ,  the stove/ oven,,,,, yes it is like a broiler oven
with 2 top burners as well...... is hidden in the passenger seat!
The interior is not like any westfalia I have ever seen,,,,
It has a great big dash plate from the Dormobile Co.
The other thing I found strange,, was the vin tag is oversized,,, it is 3
times as big as normal
Just my 2 cents!

&gt;&gt;I thought Dormobile and Westfalia were mutually exclusive
&gt;&gt;conversions...
&gt;
&gt;Thom,
&gt;
&gt;There were 2 different Dormoblies...  Westfalia Werk put Dormobile
&gt;camper tops with Westfalia interiors for the European &amp; Canadian
&gt;markets and Martin Walter (Walker?) put Dormobile tops on buses
&gt;in England.
&gt;
&gt;I am sending this from my home account, but you may forward it to the
&gt;list if you think it is important.
