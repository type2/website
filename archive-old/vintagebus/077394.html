Subject: Re: [VB] z bed questions

&gt; &gt; 	I have a z bed in my 64 bus that is from 70' or so bus.  I am going
&gt;
&gt; the bay window westy bed assemblies are slightly narrower than the
&gt; splits. so really unless the current bed fits tight to either side
&gt; (which would indicate someone making up the extra space w/ something)

the bay bed is narrower than a bay bus anyway. there is that wood part
that mounts on the drivers side wall that makes up a few inches.
I would think you could make a replacement for that bit that took up as
much space as you need.
