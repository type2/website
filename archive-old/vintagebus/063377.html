&gt;The main thing about the sump plate is it has to be flat especially 
&gt;around the stud holes where are often warped due to overtorquring.

When I first got my Bus, it was obviously leaking engine oil from
the sump plate.  At the first oil change, I investigated.  The plate
was reasonably flat, but even after I got the usual two gaskets off,
there were gasket remains on the case sealing surface.  Not so much
around the studs, but plenty between them.  Some parts cleaner and
a plastic scraper took care of that.  I use German gaskets and the
little toolkit 10/13 mm wrench to torque the sump plate nuts and
it doesn't leak.

&gt;I've found that an old chuck of thick glass, (about an inch), or any
&gt;surfaced stone that thick or thicker with a piece of wet/dry sand paper
&gt;works good to resurface something.

I used some thin glass (the glass from a picture frame) and valve
grinding compound to re-do the halves of my 20-year-old Brosol carb.
When I first re-assembled the air horn to the body (dry), an .006
feeler gauge would fit in the gap.  After about an hour lapping, I
had it to where an .002 wouldn't go in the gap and called it good.
Not as many gas fumes in my engine compartment now - always a bonus.
