Subject: Type2 Arch!ves from April 1994 ready and on-line!
Date: Sun, 5 Jul 1998 20:53:47 -0700 

Alright Ken, you can now link to the site!

  http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/

I have all the messages on-line, but I'm still indexing for the super
search (should be ready end of Monday).  In separate piles, we have all
the e-mail messages up from __April 1994 - June 1998__!  something like
90,000 messages about Type2's...

A few tips:

  o   Separate each word by a space on body and subject searches, do not
use commas, special words, or other punctuation.
  o   Try a few variations of your search.  Enter &quot;brakes rear&quot; on the
[Body] field, and if that doesn't find what you want, try &quot;brake rear
drum&quot; or other variations (notice that &quot;brakes&quot; and &quot;brake&quot; are not the
same!)
  o   If you aren't finding what you want, try LESS words.  Try just
&quot;rear drum&quot; instead of &quot;brake rear drum&quot; -- too many words will restrict
the search too much.  Remember, there is no automatic word variation
matching, try both &quot;rear drum&quot; and &quot;rear drums&quot; -- the person who wrote
the message you want may have only used pleural!
  o   Once you get to a message you like, on the individual message,
there is a link to show all of the same messages with the same subject
(thread).  You can also see all the messages from the same author (as
long as they didn't change their e-mail address &lt;grin&gt;).

From most places in the search, you should be able to bookmark and/or
paste links into e-mail to get to the same place.  That was a primary
goal of the archives... so that you can post messages pointing to
individual message or a thread.

  ========= Example 1, Individual Message =======
Example 1:  Simple example, you can jump right to a specific message.  I
used the [Subject] field and put &quot;Hooper Christmas&quot;.  I had the [Mailing
List] pull down on &quot;Type2 (December 1996 - current)&quot;.    I then read the
message and pasted the link here...
http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/sm.asp?ID=14108&amp;ml=1

  ========= Example 2, Search Link =======
Example 2:  Here is a bookmark after a search.  In this case, I used the
'standard' search and put the words &quot;clip brake&quot; in the [Body] field and
selected &quot;Type2 (December 1996 - current)&quot; on the [Mailing List] field..
Once the results came up, I pasted the link into this mail message.
http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/default.asp?body=clip+brake&amp;sub=&amp;ml=1

  ========= Example 3, thread link =========
Example 3:  Here is a link to a specific message thread.  I got here by
searching &quot;clip brake&quot; and then I saw a message I liked (second one
down, from Andy McKinley).  I read that message then pressed the &quot;Show
All Messages With Subject&quot;.  Then of course, I created the link.
  (The follow line needs to be all together, you may have to past it
together if it split.  It starts with &quot;http&quot; and ends with &quot;2775&quot; at the
end.)

r+brakes+on+a+%2775

Try to keep your questions about the archive to me in private mail,
don't post archive problems or issues to the main list.

Thanks!

P.S.  One of Ken's filters on the list won't allow you to use the word
&quot;Archives&quot; in a message subject, why we are all using &quot;Arch*ves&quot; or
&quot;Arch!ves&quot; hehe.
