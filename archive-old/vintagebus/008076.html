&gt;Just curious what other genetic mutations everyone else has seen.

I know of a guy here in AZ who took a perfectly fine splitty westfalia and
welded the
bed of a single cab to the back of it, axles and all(basically a bus twice
as long with 6 tires).He took it to bug-o-rama about 3 years ago the day he
finished TACK WELDING the thing together. Guess
the single cab had been smashed all the way in, back to the door handles and
he couldn't think of any better use for the single cab bed??
last I heard hes workin on the paint job..........................

Wade
57 single (non westfalia addition version)
