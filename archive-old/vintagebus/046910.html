&lt;&lt; I'm going to post this to the list so that someone can tell you that the
 stock clips are easy to get in, never fall out, and that the Bus will be
 heavier with a tie wire back there! :)

Hi pd,
Well we have to agree with you on the fact that the clips with the full spring
circle are better and longer lasting than the original U shaped clips.  Have
not had problems with installing either type though.  Just install one clip on
the arm and slip the bearing onto the arm and the clip.  Then slip the other
clip into the other side of the bearing and use a screwdriver to ease the clip
under and up to the front notch of the arm.       Eric &amp; Barb
