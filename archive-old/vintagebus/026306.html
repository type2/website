Hi all,

I know it's not Friday, but I bought the coolest t-shirt today.  It was
a periwinkle blue kinda t-shirt with a small 21 window bus on the front
right side, and a much larger image of the same bus on the back.  It is
a two tone white over green bus with a sunroof and a surfboard sticking
out of said sunroof.  If anyone is interested, I can see how much the
owner of the store could give 'em to me for.  It's a local store that
get's &quot;Annapolis&quot; screened on the front right under the bus.  I bought
mine for 21.95...  p-mail me if you're interested.

Paul
