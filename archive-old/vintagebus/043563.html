&gt;&gt; The Doliwa book I have says:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; M 164, Schiebetuer, Blinkleuchten vorn, bis 1/60, 241, 244
&gt;&gt;        (Sliding door, front turn signals, until 1/60)
&gt; 
&gt;but the sliding door was not offered until the 63 model year.  And what
&gt;does that have to do with liscence light lens?  the front turn signals
&gt;would, though, being N american spec.  if 164 is a spec code, that would
&gt;fit with the notes at the liscence plate lights, about us spec.   Having
&gt;turn signals instead of semaphores would fit with that.

Looking at it again, maybe this should be parsed as:

(Sliding door)   (front turn signals until 1/60)

In other words, before 1960, M 164 meant front turn signals.  After
that, as you noted, it meant &quot;sliding door&quot;.

The 1960 section of the book bears this out a little.  Apparently,
before 1960, German buses had semaphores.  So front turn signals
(US style) would have been called out as an M-code.  From June 1,
1960, all &quot;Inland&quot; models got front turn signals instead of semaphores.
No need for an M-code after that if the bus happened to be going
to the States.

Trivia: The German term for these (bullet/nipple) signals is 
&quot;Warzenblinker&quot;, which Babelfish translates to &quot;wart turn signal&quot;.
The later, flatter style, which I think is called &quot;fried egg&quot; here,
is called &quot;frog eye&quot; or &quot;fish eye&quot; in German.
