Great story, gives me chills, and reminds me of when my family lived in
europe for 9
years in the 70's. I was a kid and my family drove a 70 westy bus, there
were no other vehicles as far as I knew. I thought all vehicles had tables
beds and tents and lots of room to play around in. I could have taken my
sister out the day she shoved me in the closet by the door and wouldnt let
me out though. Still have the tent from those childhood memories and now my
kids sleep in it and have fun, attached to the side of my 67 westy.
