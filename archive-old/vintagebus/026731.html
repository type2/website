&gt; about M codes then, I'd have snagged the tag.  Seems the two tone westies
&gt; were usually euro models (mine was sold in Germany) and tend to have come
&gt; with extras.   I have seen a 66 or 67 (forget now) deluxe hardtop which was a
&gt; westy- original from factory, the white over white - very unusual.  The US
&gt; sold ones were shipped over pretty standard, you would have to order these
&gt; things like two tone paint and pay more, and wait till it showed up, AFAIK.

Yes, but the UT (US Tourist) delivery ones were usually single color.  The most
common was L87 pearl white.  Claim yours is a euro camper (delete the bumper
guards and other things) and look up the stock 67 two tone colors and paint
away.
