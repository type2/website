I understand my mistake. I know what the throw out bearing is. Thing that I

was looking for is not a bushing but the bearing that's attached to the

solenoid operating lever. I thing it's pinion. Idiot book calls it pinion.

Are these available?

 --  - -- - 
never looked for one- ask your local flaps.   I tend to use the good used 
starter or if I must get a replacement go for the $45 schmucks rebuild with 
the forever guarantee usable at any schucks/kragens/checkers
