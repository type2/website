Subject: Any lawyers out here? Engine battle becomes a possible bind.

Volks,
Hope everyone had a fine Thanksgiving.

 This is my last email about this, one to say I've given up on trying to
be compensated for the failed motor I bought from the engine builder
previously mentioned in PA. I need to find a support group of some sort
right now...:)

He is now indicating that he will be suing ME over the three emails I
sent him demanding compensation or resultant legal recourse. He claims a
stroke he had in OCT is my fault, and that I've been causing him
Intentional Emotional Distress, for saying I would employ bureaucracies
for my benefit in my case against him.

He made various statements stating that the motor was fine, and that all
damage was my fault, through underjetting, and that since I had to go
through several (3) carbs (two leaked badly) to get her running right,
that I was using it as a test bed, instead of transportation. He also
made several false claims about what this mill was made with parts wise.
(new case  (it was a 73), Kolbenshmidt pistons (they were Mahle), yada,
yada.

I will not attempt to contact him again since I do now fear legal
recourse, although I have no assets to attack, the one time that this is
a benefit. Seems I just can't win.


Come visit me in the poor house, or living in the back of my bus.
If any of you happen to be a lawyer that can spare some advice, please
contact me.

Al
