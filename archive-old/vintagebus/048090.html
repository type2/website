Subject: Re: [VB] Rear Shocks
To: cryan_at_bigfoot_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I put new shocks on my 65 westy last april.    I put KYB GR-2s in the front 
one day, and a lot of bumps in the road magically disappeared.   THe next day 
I intslled the new rear shocks, which were the KYB GAs-A Just.  THis was 
under advice that they are good for the back being stiffer and the weight  in 
a camper.   THink that idea was lame.  they are too stift IMPBO, 

I recommend the KYB GR-2s all the way around.

drove the same road in my 53 with ancient front shocks one day, and the 65 
the next day, and my god what a difference.  but you cant get GR-2s for 
barndoors.  
(or can you, prove me wrong, please)

VW boats how the load goes in the best sprung area, between the two axles.  
and it does.   engine in back, driver (and passenger) up front, load in the 
middle.
