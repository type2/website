Hi Dan,
The original tires for the 1964-67 bus and 1963 one ton was the 7.00x14 bias 
tire with a dynamic rolling radius of 313mm (12.3&quot;) or about 25&quot; diameter.  
  The problem is that the change in speeds due to larger or smaller diameter 
tires is very affected by the ring &amp; pinion.  In other words when we went had 
a 4.375 R&amp;P in our pre-1964 buses with 25&quot; diameter tires all the way around 
we got 47MPH _at_3,000RPM.  When we only replaced the rear tires with 29&quot; 
diameter the speed went up to almost 54MPH _at_ 3,000RPM.  When the same 
experiment was done with a 3.875 R&amp;P the speed went from 58MPH to 70MPH _at_ 
3,000RPM.  In other words the 4.375 R&amp;P resulted in a 7MPH increase and the 
3.875 resulted in a 14MPH increase in speed by increasing only the tire 
diameter.  So unfortunitly unless you are willing to tachometer your bus so 
we could take a guess at what your gearing is and/or dissassemble your tranny 
to count gear teeth to see what you have to begin with.  Nobody can just tell 
you just how much MPH increase you will experience by increasing your tire 
size.   Eric&amp;Barb
