&gt; The Firestone

[snip]

For what it's worth, I heard on the news this morning that Sears has dropped
the Firestone line due to an excessively high accident rate being attributed
to them failing. Of course the fact I heard it on the news doesn't make it
true, but I'm just passing it on. I personally despise Firestones for desert
heat. They can't handle it. Everyone I've ever owned grenaded or separated
in very short order, Never actually had one last long enough to have any
tread wear, so I can't speak to how well they last otherwise.
