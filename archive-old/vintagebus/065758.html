Subject: Re: [T2] gas tank resto  varnish/sludge

&gt;Finally made time to work on getting the 57 on the road. It's been sitting
&gt;since 88 when it was driven down to one of the so cal shows and back and
&gt;had been parked for an unknown amount of time prior to 88. You can smell the
&gt;varnish when you open the tank. fuel resevrve switch was completely clogged
&gt;and gummed up to the point that I had to remove it to drain the tank.
&gt;Looking at the por-15 kit they claim their chemicals will clean this out but
&gt;the hot rod guys I've talked to say nothing will and I should have it sand
&gt;blasted inside. Anyone have hands on experience with cleaning out a tank
&gt;with 10-15 years of varnish build up? Using this product or any
&gt;other?http://www.por15_dot_com/tankseal_fuelpreserve.html

Any radiator shop can clean out a tank with the same chemicals that they 
use to clean out a radiator.

MUCH better for the metal.
