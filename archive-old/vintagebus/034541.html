Subject: 56 Kombi Camper Interior question
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Well after attending the Sacramento Bug-O-Rama I've figured out that my 56 is
a camper not just a Kombi. All it has right now is the flip top, wood panels
in the back, and the base something. What pieces am I missing? What westy
interiors would be &quot;correct&quot; for this bus? I've heard that even big window
westy parts are the same is that true? Does anyone have the measurments for
the pieces I need? I think it would be cheaper to make them than try to dig up
a 56 westy interior.
