&gt; The pulling to the left just started soon after I adjusted the brakes (never 
&gt; had done it with any other adjustments).  Could I have a cyl. leaking on 
&gt; the right side front???  

Hi Steve,
Could be, but more likely it is a cylinder just barely leaking on the left 
side causing the brakes to grab more like when one wets thier fingers to 
count money.
