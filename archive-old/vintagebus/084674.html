Subject: Re: [VB]  need suggestions onloading busses

....... I found a local junk yard with 2 old split window busses, I want to
buy 
&gt; to cut up for parts.  They have been striped of all the good stuff,
&gt; including front axle beams, and rear transaxlea.  Here is my problem, I
&gt; have no idea how I can get them onto a trailer with no wheels on them at
&gt; all.  Any Suggestions? ............

Forklift!

Tom-seriously, I have seen it done
