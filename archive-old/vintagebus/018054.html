In addition to what Clara said, there are a few more things you might look at to educate yourself.

Go the Everett's page and look under litature.  There is some really good information there.

This is a SO42 brochure and manual that is almost identical to your bus.  Study it.  About the only differences between the 66 in the brochure, and your 67 are that late 67 campers came with the bay window latch handles (I have a early 67 that has the squared off earlier handles) and the water pumps are possibly different.  I think all 67's had the chrome triangle handled pumps.  I have a '65 that has the plunger type pump.  

I just noticed that the bus pictured in the 66 booklet might not be a 66.  It has the clamshell light shades for the two interior drivers side lights.  I think those were mid 64 to early 65 light shades.  After that they changed to a rectangle shade.  Not sure exactly when the change happened, but pretty sure it was early/mid 65.  I've only seen these (hard to find BTW) on 64 SO42's

Is your bus a walk through or a bench?  You'll notice that the rear facing seat is different on the respective busses.  The W/T busses have a single rear facing jump seat with a removable cushion/seat that fits between the jump seat and the icebox.  The bench models have a full length seat that goes from the drivers side wall to the icebox.

Speaking of iceboxes, the W/T box will obviously not have the cut out on the back for the spare tire well bulge that the bench model will have.  Otherwise the boxes are about the same.  There are changes in the water tank design to coincide with the different water pump models, but that's too anal even for me ;-)

One more piece of minutiae is that the door/icebox utility table support arms should be a goldish anodized finish on the 67's while the earlier ones would have been painted pearl white or beige gray or something like that.

I'm sure there are more minute detail changes, but I hear someone goose stepping up behind me.

    I am trying to find out what the original camper equiptment should be in 
this 67. I like the stuff in my 72 and was kinda hoping most of it was stock 
for 67 as well, for that could save me some serious cash Im sure. 
    I have the center pop-top, but what is it for? I know the later models 
have either a cot or a bed up there, but there is no imaginable way someone 
could sleep up in this thing. Is it just so you have room to stand up? 
    Where is the best supplier for like the window seals and such and is it 
true that the 67 has a one year only master cylinder that is in the $200 
range?
    
=  ==  == = 
yes the small pop top is for standing up in, not for sleeping in. 

the kit yours came with was probably a s042 kit, which is verysimilar to the 
72 westys you often see, with the Z-bed, blind spot closet/cabinet, 
headnager/fold up table/rear facing seat behind driver, ice box behind 
passneger.

but it was different.   for one, the blind spot cabinet is longer in the 68 
and ons, , it can be made to fit with some measureing and woodworking, if 
that is your plan.   the splitty icebox came with water tanks and pumps, but 
no sinks.   The handles are a different shape (but functoially 
interchangable)  All the construction is somewhat different, and it will be 
clear to someone who knows splittys so-42s tht you have a bay kit, but if the 
purpose is to have a camper kit and perfect anal restoration is not a 
priority, yes you can use the bay kit with mods to the blind spot cabinet.    
  

There are several suplliers for window seals, the best known are Wolfsberg 
West, and WCM.    Both companies make and sell many parts for buses.  The WW 
peple really know their stuff.  Richard at WW has a nice velvet green 66 
(65?67?) westy he drives.

Yes the 67 master cylinder is one year only, and costlier.   except for the 
first 15K or so 67s.   does your has the later or the earlier kind?  What is 
your VIN?  is the MC bad?   if it is good you dont need a new one.   flushing 
the brake system every coupler years helps preserve brake components.

If you look behind the pass seat there should be a 2&quot;x3&quot; metal tag screwed on 
there.  Copy every thing on it down, and go to the decoder on the 
vintagebus_dot_com webpage, which will reveal wonderful info such as your buses 
birthday, what options it came with (as in which version of the westy set 
up), where it was sent, etc.
