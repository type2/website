Subject: Your opinion please.....

I have a 1600 DP in a '71 Westy. Engine is basically stock with Kadrons and
extractor. Went out to buy intake manifold gaskets this AM and was shown
1)bakelite gaskets, 2)metal gaskets, and 3) fiber gaskets. Checked the
archives and got mixed reviews. Which one is best at preventing leaks? Which
one would be best for this application? As always, TIA.TBear
