Subject: RE: [VB] Bus Sightings

I always knew Laurence Welk was a secret bus horder. Wonder if the busses =
come equipped with their own bubble machine?

BTW obligatory bus content - anyone have trouble shifting with aftermarket =
gear lock installed on a  65 bus? I installed one a few years ago and it =
worked fine- however shifing has gotten progressively worse (especially =
first and reverse). I have spent about 10 nanoseconds investigating but am =
quite confident clutch etc adjusted properly.

If anybody is interested I have rediscovered a hidden VW junkyard down in
&gt; Altus Oklahoma that has a ton of stuff in it. I say rediscovered because
I
&gt; was stationed there in the Air Force until 1990 when I got stationed in
&gt; Japan. I discovered this place by accident , it's located at the end of
the
&gt; runway (north) just off of Altus A.F.B in a big huddle of tree's. The =
guy
&gt; who ran the place only let me back there one time to retrieve a part for
my
&gt; 59 bug and that was it. Well apparantly he is now very close to =
departing
&gt; this place we call earth, or already has, and his junkyard now belongs =
to
&gt; his son who also not very far behind his father, I learned all this from
the
&gt; mother who lives in the house right in front of the place. Anyway from
what
&gt; I could see from my driveby's is that he has panels, deluxes and =
standard
&gt; splittie's back there along with bugs and type 3's and whatever else in
the
&gt;
