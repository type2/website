Subject: [VB] Kelley Park -thanks yto the vintage club
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Kelly park was great fun.........got to look at some neat stuff before I put 
my stuff out and sellers kept on coming in for another hour it seemed. The 
Golden Gate chapter did a great job with what they had to work with...........

its always a problem when everyone has to enter thru one gate, but thats what 
the park told them to do....it was out of their control.
And leaving a certain group of cars out would not have solved the problem, 
its just getting too big for the park, 

I think the club did a great job, lots of these guys would have loved to be 
out scrounging for parts instead of parking cars......

What did I like best......the Mountain Dew van was cool........
And the Red 67 Empi GTV bug had my name all over it.....it followed me 
home........
Anyone have any extra original Empi trinkets.........

As far as Fords + Chevy vans + pick-ups, if you want to buy parts people have 
to get them there somehow,  not to many people want to put all the junk in a 
restored bus (well Howard + Ronnie did)  and if you think they are going to 
unload their parts and park the Fords/Chevies in the back, no way.....you 
will just get less stuff to buy....

well back working on the projects, VW Classic / OCTO is getting closer.....

PS.......Oh did anyone ask Dave Heard what day the SOTO show is ? 
I hope its not the same day again.........back to work..........
