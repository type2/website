I agree totally,

I think its quite silly that people are running around saying they NEED
all this original glass to get their busses back on the road.  I am sure
they want it, but need???

I mean, later model splitty glass is still pretty readily available, if
they want to get on the road, put that in and look for the rare early logo
stuff over time... get some cut.  My 61 has both windshields generic cut
from sheet glass.  I dont NEED original logo glass to replace it, hell i
dont even want it particularly. (though i will admit that i get a kick out
of what glass i have that is original, and if i ran into more i probably
wouldnt break it out of spite...)

how hard is it really to change out the glass later if you find the right
stuff, esp on things like the front side windows where you could just bolt
in an entire 64+ frame as you seek out that rare 57 glass...  4 big screws
and yer switched over...

peas,

Steve
