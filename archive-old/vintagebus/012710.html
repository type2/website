Tom, I have to put my bus up for sale ( unfortunately) It is a 1965 camper,
new engine &amp; transmission from totally European in Irwindale. new brake
drums,brakes,hardware bearing front and rear. recently reupholstered and
painted. Looks very much like the bus on your home page less roof rack.  I am
looking for a quick sale at 6500 firm,Its insured for 10K, its a sacrifice
sell, I want it to go to a good home,  if you know of anyone looking for a
bus  thats already done, please send them my way.
