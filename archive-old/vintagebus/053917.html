Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Ordering from Bus Depot??

Ilearned to call Bus Depot directly, instead of their order hotline, to ask specifically if what I wanted is in stock.  The last couple times I've called, almost everything I wanted was out of stock, so at least I saved myself the aggravation of ordering and then waiting long periods of time to get my stuff.  In my experience, they haven't ever informed me in the past of things being back-ordered, so I had to take the initiative myself and call them to find out where my stuff is.  

Another list member addressed the fact that Bus Depot takes a long time to ship, and made the comment that he'd pay the extra couple of dollars for 2-day delivery.  With all due respect, I don't think that list member ever tried that approach with the Bus Depot.  I tried about 4 weeks ago, and there is a very expensive charge to get things shipped in 2 days.  As a matter of fact, paying this big charge only gets your order moved up in the queue.  Instead of shipping out in a week's time, it will ship out in about 2-3 days, then come to you via 2-day shipping.  Sure, you'll get your order much faster than the normal way, but if I pay alot for 2-day shipping, I want to get my stuff in 2 or 3 days.

One final complaint.  In buying stuff to fix or restore my bus, I kind of take the &quot;squirrel&quot; approach, whereas I gather my stuff over periods of months, sometimes a year.  Well, about a year ago I ordered a sealed ball-bearing unit for the sliding door track's vertical wheel from Bus Depot.  I tried installing it about 5-6 weeks ago, and it didn't fit.  This thing cost me almost $50.  I called Bus Depot to see if I could exchange this thing for store credit, and the customer service guy went on the computer and saw all my other orders except this one.  Of course, I didn't have the invoice for it, and maybe a year is too long to expect a business to exchange a part, but I've had other vendors do it.  

Bottom line for me?  If you don't need it fast, call Bus Depot directly, not their order hotline, and ask specifically if the parts you want are in stock.  Hope that the parts don't get sold to somebody in the queue ahead of you, then call them in 2 weeks and ask if all the items in your order have shipped.  If something went out of stock before your order shipped, cancel the backordered item and find it elsewhere.  

The owner of Bus Depot, Ron Salmon, does a great job of finding things that not many other vendors have, and his prices are actually very good.  So I'll probably order from them in the future, but I will follow my own advice about ordering from them.
