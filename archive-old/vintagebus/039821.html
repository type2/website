My son and I have been playing with a recently aquired presurrized blaster 
using a silica sand on the underside of his panel and although it does not 
heat the area up dramatically the weather has been very cool here and would 
not recommend its use for large panels.  Indeed, I recall a Hot VWs article 
sometime back discussing this very thing and recommending the use of Walnut 
shells over a silica media... I also recall some talk of a plastic media but 
couldn't swear by it.  There is suppose to be a facility near Benicia in 
Cordelia that blasts but I have found it yet.. if I do, and I will look 
again tomorrow, I will repost.

Eastwood offers a number of different media for home use and the various 
applications so you might want to hit their site to see what they say.

&gt;
&gt;Can they do it in any other media?  Soda ash?  Plastic media?
&gt;
&gt;The #80 will tear up the metal pretty good.  I only use it on
&gt;rusty surfaces myself.  I've used walnut shells, and it's amazing
&gt;how delicate they are.  I used them to remove successive layers
&gt;of paint from a friend's Datsun Roadster.  The only problem I
&gt;had was the media size wasn't very regular, meaning I kept having
&gt;big chunks of oversized media clogging my nozzle.

&gt; &gt; insisting that they can use silica (somethin about 80 grit) sand on my 
&gt;panel
&gt; &gt; and not have ANY warpage cause they are just so damn skilled etc etc
&gt; &gt; So what do I do? are they just bs'ing me? Anyone ever silica blasted a
&gt; &gt; panel? Got prices from 250 to 400. Anyone have any thoughts on this 
&gt;matter?
