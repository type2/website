Subject: Brazilin Corner Windows

I just brought some corner windows that have VW Brazil
written on the ID tag.  Will these fit a German Bus?
Is there anywhere that outlines all the differences
between the German and Brazilin Busses on the net?
Also how much for a set of sky light windows, how much
for corner windows and where could I buy them.  Does
any one make them?

Thanks Derry
