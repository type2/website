 Oh, come on. They are nifty. I ride with them open all summer in the
 singlecab. You get that cool hundred-mile-an-hour-hairdo and when it is 115
 out if you smile it will take the enamel off your teeth. Can be a little
 scary sometimes. Once a truck in front of me threw up a big empty plastic
 bag, must have been from like a 40 lb. sack of ice. Plastered me right in
 the face. Watching it come at me through the open window was almost as bad
 as when it hit me, I think I made a marble. Sprayed the cherry off of my
 cigarette all over. Nasty. Get a few bees every now and then. Oh yeah, and
 they leak, but only when it is raining.  8^)

I have never had anything hit me when driving with the safaris open.   Have 
them in my 61 (original) and had them in my 65 for one summer.   When I got 
the 61 the PO recommended that when driving on the freeway use a piece of 1x2 
to prop the window open an inch or two- place it between bus and window 
frame.  This relieves stress on the chrome props, and you get plenty of air 
with it two inches open.   Don't see the point of having them wide open on 
freeway.

they don't leak with NOS seals for about a year, except a slight drip in 
heavy rains.  yes, they leak.   they will leak.  they have leaked.  i 
wouldn't be surprised if they keep leaking.  the person who suggested the 
holes drilling in the package tray for drainage hadn't seen the swiss cheese 
effect that comes from 30 + years of having them in a bus.
