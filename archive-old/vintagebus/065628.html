&gt; For all of you daydreaming about a shop- check out this one, posted on
&gt; the Jeepster bulletin board- I can't imagine how great of a shape my
&gt; VW's would be in if I had this facility...

&gt; Sure is no fun working on the bus outside in the dark and cold...
&gt; (any other Jeep/Jeepster folks feel free to drop me a line...)

Thank you!  I'm in the planning stages of a shop and am always looking
for better ideas and designs since I will be building from scratch. 
Anybody else have some good links??
