&gt; Well since its Friday and a few people have asked...
&gt;
&gt;   Lisa and I had a little girl on September 8, 6lbs,6oz
&gt; 19&quot; long (which is why we missed Jerome)! I brought Lisa
&gt; and Emma home in the New beetle, but look forward to our
&gt; first family outing in the DC!

Congratulations!  I bet that Emma can already do a pretty fair VW engine
imitation!

&gt;  ....so how long do I have to wait to teach Emma how to
&gt; adjust the valves on the Double Cab??

As soon as she can be propped up in a sitting position.  Don't waste those
&quot;golden years&quot; when she can get at the valves without bumping her head!
