Sorry, no direct bus content.

A good friend of mine is in dire need of a pair of triangular plastic reflectors that are common to Puck trailers, and other vintage euro trailers.  I believe they might even have &quot;Made in Germany&quot; stamped on them.  I'm not sure of the specific dimensions. but I'm thinking the sides are approximately 4&quot; - 6&quot; long.

If anyone has, or knows of any for sale, or any leads, he would be forever grateful.

TIA.

Robert
