&gt; Hmmm....this does indeed come as a surprise to me.  Ryan, the editor of
&gt; Trends wrote me last week asking me to write a little about AIRS and send it
&gt; to him for the February issue of trends.
&gt; 
&gt; I am talking with Wade about hiding the web site until we can take care of
&gt; this situation.

I don't see what is so dangerous about the AIRS site getting some
publicity!  Sure, it will get some more use, but isn't the whole idea to
help each other out when needed?

I do think that it would be an excellent idea for anyone who is asked for
aid from the AIRS site to make sure that the person asking for aid is also
on the AIRS site.  This is proof that the person asking for aid is a
participant, not a freeloader.

It might be a good idea for the Site to carry a message that states that
if you are not on the AIRS list you shouldn't expect to get any assistance
from the AIRS members.
