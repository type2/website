&gt; The logic is that you dont need a special part. Correct way? There is no 
&gt; correct way, altering the design of the carb by putting any plug is 
&gt; incorrect. I am merely stating how to do it, but I am not endorsing it.

But this is not some aftermarket thing it is actually designed for this
purpose by the manufacturer. So I'd have to say it is 'a correct way'
probably more correct than hacking off the end of the cutoff.

&gt; The reason why this way is better is that its free, and accomplishes the 
&gt; same goal.


True.

&gt; A &quot;jet&quot; is incorrect, there is no jet, just a plug either way.

&quot;Jet&quot; is incorrect, yes, but you obviously have never seen this part. it 
is somewhat more complex than a mere plug.
