Subject: Re: [VB] MIDDLE SEAT

I've never seen this.  Pics would be helpful.  The grab bar end-thingys on
all of the later middle seats in factory brochures and promotional lit. were
color keyed to the &quot;silver-beige&quot; grab bar.  They tend to dissolve and
crumble over time.

&gt; My 66 has a 2/3 middle seat, and yes, the ends of the grab bar are a
chromy
&gt; like plastic. I will take pics if any one needs them for info. This bus is
a
&gt; non walkthrough, and the mount plates use the slip in bolts to mount, wish
I
&gt; had all of them, but that's for later! :) The legs aren't drilled for the
&gt; new style hold down, so that should be 67 spme time, yes.
&gt; There is no kick panel on mine, didn't know if it was supposed to have one
&gt; or not though.

&gt; Hi Dan!
&gt; Full width middle seats were factory installed in some walk-throughs in
'66
&gt; and '67.  I don't know of an &quot;M-Code&quot; for this, but it was done.  I also
&gt; don't know if this was ever done on earlier buses...I've never seen one.
&gt; And, yes, late '66-'67 full-width AND 2/3 seats were different from
earlier
&gt; ones.  The full-width seat had the outer (right side) leg canted outward
and
&gt; the fold down part of the seat back was twisted inward slightly to allow
&gt; easier access to the rear seat.  The 2/3 seat had NO outer leg and NO
&gt; infamous clip-on &quot;kick panel&quot;.  The first legs (from right to left) were
&gt; offset several inches inward to the left under the seat...don't know why.
&gt; This 2/3 seat is very rarely seen.  And , as already mentioned, at some
&gt; point (late '67?) the lower frames on these seats were factory drilled
with
&gt; holes for the new type hold down clamps that supposedly kept the seats
from
&gt; slipping in a crash.  Also, NONE of these later seats had chrome ends or
&gt; metal grab handles as alluded  to in an earlier post.  They were all
&gt; equipped with vinyl grab bars and bio-degradable plastic end caps that I
&gt; wish someone would reproduce!!
