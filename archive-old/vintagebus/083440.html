Subject: HCBF Favor

Would there be anyone from the north heading to HCBF that would be willing
to help me get a roof top tent from Franklin PA(16323)? I don't have the $$
right now to make a road trip from VA to PA. Any help would be greatly
appreciated.I have a few parts for bays and splits that I would be more than
happy to hook you up with .

Thanks
Ian in norfolk
