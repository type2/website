Subject: 6v to 12 v humor
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id OAA46968

during my search a while ago for 6 volt gauges, and 6 volt to 12 volt
converters I asked a few companies about their abilities to make a 6v to 12
volt converter asI couldn't find them on their websites...anyway I just got a
reply back from one of them. I can get a &quot;This is a fully isolated, 12 amp,
shock resistant, weaoutside mounting, serious unit.&quot; for only $429....thats
four hundred and twenty nine dollars.  I think I'll pass on this one, but if
anyone else has $429 lying arond this christams season and desires to get rid
of it let me know...
