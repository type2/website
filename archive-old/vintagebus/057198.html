Subject: Re: [VB] I have brakes, just no lights!

Volks!

After the help I recieved, I went out to start cleaning connections, and
found two fuses where the cap that fits into the block had broken from
the link.  It looked perfect when it was in the holder, but as soon as I
touched it, it fell apart.

Hey, when Clara, Eric and Barb, and P &amp; C respond to your technical
issues, is that what Moses felt like on Mt. Sinai?

Gretchen rides again!  (Just in time for it to start raining again. 
Yesterday= 74 deg. and I was in a Tshirt and shorts.  Now I wear a
turtleneck and a jacket and its raining.)
