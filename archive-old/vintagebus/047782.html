I just got back from the VW show in Litchfield Conn. It kinda make's me sick 
to think about turning a rare Panel (didn't see a one) into a POS race car. I 
know what I think won't matter but that suck's. I think an unmolested Panel 
may be the rarest of the rare i can't remember the last time i saw one. O 
well :&gt;(
