Subject: Weber 32/36 vs Solex 34
Date: Fri, 5 May 2000 10:23:36 +0200 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi list,

I need to rebuild or replace my existing carb(solex 34). A replacement costs
about the same as a Weber 32/36 with it's manifold adaptor.

Other than the obvious non-stock part issue what are the pros and cons
associated with using the baby Weber progressive as a replacement?

ps. the engine is stock except for a really crappy extractor which I got cos
there were no real bus exhausts in stock at the time that the engine went in
and I was not prepared to cut the apron for a bug exhaust.

TIA 

Michael
