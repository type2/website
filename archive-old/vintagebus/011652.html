&gt; Hey List
&gt; 
&gt; So I never did get an answer to my question about what to do about an
&gt; antenae for
&gt; my 59 standard - is there a way to go about it with out drilling a
hole
&gt; in my bus.

If all you want is FM reception, you can use a through-the-glass
antenna that sticks on the inside and outside of the window.  Check
out amateur radio stores for examples.

These antennas will _not_ work for AM, as they are designed to pass
VHF signals only.

Another route is to use a gutter-mount antenna and pass the coax out
through the air vents.  Don't know if there are any convenient air
vents on your bus, though
