There are plenty of AZ Bus Club members in/around Phoenix.  I for one live 
about a mile off of I-10 on the West side of town.  You are welcome to stop, 
visit, camp, sleep on the couch, whatever.  At this time, I am tentatively 
planning on going to Calif. sometime Friday, meeting up with the Havasu guys, 
doing the campout thing, hit the OCTO show on Saturday, do the campout thing 
that night, and head back Sunday, passing on the Classic.  Since my DC is 
down for who knows how long, I'll be traveling in the F_at_rd, probably with Joe 
Ginter (past ABC Pres) in his F_at_rd towing his bus.  Feel free to p-mail if 
interested.....
