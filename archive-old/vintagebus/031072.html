J.C. Whitney sells the same shrink-wrapped Bentley reprint of VW's 63-67
bus manual, only $60 plus shipping.  Check it out in their VW specialty
catalogue.

Or you can wait around on eBay for another one of the original 2-volume
factory sets to show up.  They usually go for around $75 per volume.

&gt; I'm assuming that Bentley is the manual to have. After searching the web
&gt; mostly all I found was &quot;workshop manual 63-67 type 2&quot;.  Is this the best one
&gt; to have? Can I get it anywhere cheaper than $99.95?  Anyone have an old beat
&gt; up copy that they would consider selling for a reasonable price?
