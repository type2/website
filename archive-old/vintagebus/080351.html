John, I had the same problem on my 65 DC. I ended up taking the fuse
block off and cleaning all the contacts and soldering the tabs. That
helped somewhat except for the hi/lo power when the wipers were going
back and forth and the yellow headlights. I then started pulling
switches out of the dash and using a small brass brush cleaned up the
contacts on all of the switches. That helped even more but the
headlights were still too dim. I ended up running a #10 wire from the
battery through a relay and using the side switch to control the relay
and power the headlights directly off the battery. That solved that.

Dear List;

I'm having electrical problems with my '66 bus. It is a 6 volt system.
The bus runs fine until I turn on my headlights or windshield wipers. As
soon as I do, the engine starts to run rough and lose power. When I turn
the electrical stuff off, it runs fine again. I replaced the voltage
regulator and this seemed to have solved the problem for awhile but now
it's back again. thanks in advance for any advice you may provide.
