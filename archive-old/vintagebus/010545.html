Subject: Goodbye, had enough..

 Well I'm outta here..I'll take my bus and my hobbie and go it alone..All
the bickering and attitudes about this Hoover thing reminds me of why I left
the club thing..I'll enjoy my VW myself and venture out to buy parts when
nessesary. It's just too &quot;high stress&quot; and competitive doing the group
thing. I can pee farther than you can!!!
 To all you who've helped I thank you..
 
  Signing off..
