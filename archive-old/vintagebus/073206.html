&gt; Better to NOT drill a hole in your dash.  Countless
&gt; people say countless
&gt; things while they weld/replace dashes that previous
&gt; owners have cut for
&gt; things like gauges, switches, CD players, etc.

I'm totally with Gene, there.
Don't do anything that can't be undone easily in about
15 minutes, &amp; that means no welding or cutting.
Another idea is to take out the fibreboard roof panel
above you head, make another out of new fibreboard and
make a little overhead guage pod to go in it.
You get that cool aircraft look, and with a dipstick
sender and multiple oil pressure sender you can have
oil temp &amp; pressure guages up there as well.
Then, when you sell it on or return it to standard
just fit that original overhead panel &amp; disconnect the
wiring.
I'll send you a pic of that guage pod if you'd like.
It's what I'm going to do in my '67 Panel.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
