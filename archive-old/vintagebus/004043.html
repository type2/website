&gt; i was thinking you were looking for the starter bushing which supports
&gt; the starter in the trans, ( and you may want to check that one as well )
&gt; but now i think you are looking for the &quot; bendix drive &quot; on the starter,
&gt; which you probably can't buy separately as new, but could replace
&gt; from a used starter which has a bad winding or other defect. if this part
&gt; is defective, you may also want to examine the flywheel teeth. if you are
&gt; testing the starter on the bench, you must realize that the armature must
be
&gt; supported just as it is when installed, and will short if you attempt to
apply
&gt; voltage unless it is . the term &quot;throw-out bearing&quot; , which  technically
is the
&gt; function of the &quot; bendix drive &quot; , is more often applied to the clutch
release bearing.
----------------------------------------&gt;

and that's exactly what I need. Teeth are all fine on the flywheel and on
the starter. Bearing has been hitting something and got beat-up. Now I took
everything apart but you're right, I should of tested it before doing it.
Although I don't have a 6V battery, shucks! well, anybody with a bad 6V
starter they want to get rid off? I believe that part number is SR 11X. At
least that's what all the guys out there have. I have a 1600cc DP motor.

Thanks
