&lt;&lt; 've got an intermittent problem with my brakes. Have just rebuilt all 
 cylinders and put on new shoes all the way around. Also put new line in from 
 MC to back &quot;T&quot;. I had trouble bleeding the rear once so I also took out the 
 MC, Disassembled it and cleaned it up. Honed the inside and put on a new 
 rubber washer on the piston. Tried to bleed them again and fronts bled fine 
 but then the rear still wouldn't. Then I realized that fluid must be getting 
 cought back there because if you push and hold the pedal for a time the back 
 brakes start to stick and hold even when there is no pressure on the pedal. 
 So now I bled the back at the T and then at the rear wheels and it seems to 
 be working now. What is up with my bus? i'm confused. Is this some single 
 circuit secret that I don't get?

how about your rubber flex hoses?  these get old and are probably collapsed 
inside, even if they look ok on the outside.  and the hydraulic pressure will 
let fluid through the hose, but not back to the MC, meaning the brakes will 
stick.   If you don't know they have been redone in the past few years, 
better replace all four.  You could also remove the hose at the end closest 
to the front of the car-  get a 11mm line wrench and a 17mm open end wrench 
to break the nut loose.   after the connection is loose (apply penetrating 
oiil) pry or knock the U shaped holder clip out , then undo the connection 
with an 11mm open end wrench.  pull the rubber hose off.  watch itwhile a 
friend steps on the pedal- fluid comes out- blame your flex hoses for 
blocking it to the rear wheels.
