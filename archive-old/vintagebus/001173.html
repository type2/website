Hey there Gene - BTDT.  Right now I've got the beam out of my 67.  It looks
funny sitting there on jackstands with no front wheels - kind of like a
hoverbus. :-)  In order to do something right, you're right - it takes a lot
of time and you'll find that after you remove something that you never
planned to actually work on - there will be something amiss and you'll end
up fixing that part too.  With this front end removal of the bus, I've got
so many pieces and parts laying around, I'll be hitting the Bentley pretty
hard to get it all assembled correctly.  It'd hard work but keep thinking
ahead to the fun times when it's done - that is my number one driving force.
