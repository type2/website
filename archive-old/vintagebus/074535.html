Hi Boyd,
IF your bus was a grey market import or one of the ones volk would buy drive 
in Europe and then when thier vacation was over they would ship thier now 
barely used VW to the US via one of VWs frieghters it would have a VW of Germany 
factory drilled antennia placement.  If your bus if sold here in the USA new at 
a VOA dealership it would have been without any antennia holes except where 
the VOA dealer or any radio shop dealer would put the holes in any of a couple 
of dozen places on your bus!  If you are going with Safari windows you will 
need to either install a center mount or side mount antennia with wasp waist 
bend area near the base to work to work with them properly.
