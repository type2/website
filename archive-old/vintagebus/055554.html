Subject: Re: [VB] NOS spindles/kingpins etc

Don -

In Early 63 (999 305) only the 20mm King Pins were beefed up a bit to resemble 
the 64-67 style (22mm), but the Link Pins remained the same as the earlier.  
Sort of a ½ 3/55-63, ½ 64-67 style setup requiring the oddball spindles (211 
405 301C/302C) to work correctly.  If replaced as a unit (as you say/ask 
below), they will work just fine on your 61, no modifications needed.  I did 
this on a 61 Panel I owned back in the early 90's.  Wheel Bearings, Wheel 
Seals, Tie Rods are the same, so no worries there.

The only drawback is when you need to replace the Kingpins down the road, they 
can be a real pain to find as the were only used from Early 63 (999 305 - about 
November 62) thru the end of 63 production.  The guy who has these for sale 
maybe selling these for just that very reason.

***************************
&gt; I need to replace these on my '61 panelvan.  I have a located a seller that
&gt; has complete NOS setups that include the spindles, king pins, link pins,
&gt; needle bearings, grease nipples etc.  His ad says they are VW part #'s 211
&gt; 405 301C and 211 405 302C and that they are for chassis # 999305 to 1 144
&gt; 281.  I thought these were all basically the same with some modifications
&gt; for 1964 and up.  Why wouldn't these fit a 1961, chassis # 646230???????
&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, Don.
