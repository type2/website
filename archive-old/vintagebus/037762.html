Subject: 55-57 reflectors for sale - $205
Message-Id: &lt;990617135548JN.11396_at_webd2.iname_dot_net&gt;

I have a set of Perfect 55-57 reflectors for sale, they are 'incorrect' for my Barndoor so anybody want 'em?  $205 firm, a good price, I assure you.  These are real VW and are heavy glass as they should be.  They were NOS but I put them on my Bus once for the '98 Classic.

I do need a 'correct' set of Barndoor 'big-diamond' black-back reflectors so trades are welcome.

These are for a US-spec vehicle.
