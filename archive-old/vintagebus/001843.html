Dave,

Exactly my point! You should however be able to admit that there are some
cables that would not be up to the task which may have been the case with
Ronnie's (already trash) linkage.

Maybe with your experience and available parts you should try this on the
Express. You will not have to improve the Kadron linkage much at all to get
a tremendously better set up.

&gt; I've been watching this thread with amusement.  My 'other love' is
&gt; motorcycles, having been wrenching and riding for years.  I currently
&gt; own/maintain 2 aircooled BMWs in addition to 2 buses.  I've wrenched in
bike
&gt; shops on both coasts.
&gt;
&gt; Motorcycles use cables to operate the carburators.  I have no troubles
&gt; synchronizing anything between 2 to 6 carbs on a motorcycle and once you
get
&gt; over the initial cable streach, cables hold their setting very well.  The
&gt; streach can be lessened if your return springs do not have a huge amount
of
&gt; tension. I've had better luck maintaining the synch on my cable operated
&gt; bikes than I have with the Kadron push/pull on the Express.
&gt;
&gt; This, and $1.00 will get you a cup of coffee in some places.
&gt;
&gt; Mad Uncle Dave
