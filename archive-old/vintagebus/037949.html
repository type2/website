&lt;&lt;  It pulls to the right when you first step on the brakes. It stops pulling 
very quickly, even though you still have the brakes on. If I step on the 
brakes again right away it does not pull. If I wait about 5 minutes the first 
time I step on the brakes it pulls again. I thought I was dripping a small 
amount of brake fluid and that was causing
 the pull. I have seen no noticeable drop in fluid.&gt;&gt;
Hi Craig,
Niether did we, but when we finally pulled the front drums off and found a 
wheel cylinder seeping slightly which in turn dampened the shoe nearest it 
causing tha t side to brake harder.  Just like wetting your fingers slightly 
helps one finger through a bundle of papers easier due to increased friction.

&lt;&lt; Also after adjusting the brakes and the pedal being nice and high, it will 
drop to about half way down within about a 2 week span. It is not spongy just 
low. &gt;&gt;
Are they new brake shoes?  If so you will have to adjust them two or even 
three times in the first month or two to allow the smaller outer diameter 
shoes to wear until they fit perfectly into the bigger inner diameter of the 
brake drums.  There after it still is a good idea to adjust the shoes to 
insure the maximum amount of sq inches of brake shoes against the drums.
