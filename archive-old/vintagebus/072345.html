Hi folks,

The next meeting the Inland Valley Volkswagens is Saturday, May 10.  We meet 
at 11:30 A.M. at Bobby Bajas on the corner of Vineyard and Foothill in Rancho 
Cucamonga.  We are open to all VW's and really need more buses.  For more 
info go to http://www.ivvw_dot_org

Hope to see some list members there,

Rob
