Everybody that might be intrerested there is a campout, &quot;The DAM campout in

This is just outside of Eldon, MO. They do have a website but i've misplaced it.
The three NEATO Chapters of Missouri should be well represented.

Lazy K Campground  573-365-1374

 Also in St. Louis, The Gateway Volkwagen Club &amp; Southland Volkwagen is have
