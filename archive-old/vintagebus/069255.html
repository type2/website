&gt; My source for that information was a series of Sam's Photofacts that were 
&gt; printed in the era of each radio.  I was unable to come up with any

&gt; distributed in VWs in the US as the sapphires.

Hi Volks,
If you just are interested in images of fantastic automobile radios for VW 
and others try:
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://gutefahrt_dot_com/&quot;&gt;http://gutefahrt_dot_com/&lt;/A&gt;
and click on the &quot;radio&quot; listed on the left.
Sapphire radios were USA made for VOA and so probably were cheaper than 
Blaupunkt radios since thier price was probably raised due to import taxes 
and fees.
We have a thick ringed binder full of Blaupunkt service manuals and do have 
quite a few of the Sam's Photofacts on the Blaupunkts and other radios.  Some 
of which we have never otherwise heard of or seen an example!
