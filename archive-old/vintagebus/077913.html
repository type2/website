Subject: RE: [T2] Re: [VB] Last Call, True Canadian Winter Bus Campout
  is TOMORROW

Being a Canadian..
I can tell you that down in the US you have plenty of trails and stuff to do 
:)
Fun is where you make it, and the rest where it finds you.

And the bathrooms are heated cause it's &lt;brrrrr&gt; winter.
Cold showers though.. Canadians don't need hot water.

&gt;
&gt;Why is it that the so-called &quot;greatest nation on earth&quot; can't have such
&gt;recreational amenities and opportunitie?  Even the Aussies have such a
&gt;trail--both countries are roughly the same size as each other, 20-25
&gt;million, heck, CA has more people than that.  AND, they have a
&gt;geographcal area roughly the same size as the U.S.  (roughly)
