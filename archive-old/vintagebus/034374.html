Subject:  RE: [VB] If it's not one thing .....more on steering box b
	ushes and bearings
Date: Wed, 29 Mar 2000 11:16:28 +0930


Here in Aus most places that sell bearings also
sell bushes.  So you sorta turn up with your old
bush and get em to supply the closest they have.
They should also be able to supply you with ball bearings?

Graig (with Rosie) you run an engineering shop don't you?
Any ideas on suppliers in the US?

Hopefully they have some bushes with the right OD and an ID that will
be OK with reaming, or drilling and reaming.....

Even if the OD is over you can get em machined down
(get 50 done and sell em to cover the costs?...)

It'll only take one person to spend a little time tracking down a source and
then
you'll all know about it?

	In other news, the steering is sloppy.  Decided to shop around for a
new
	box; the only places I knew of were Kymco, which didn't have them,
and Bus
	Boys.  $350 for a locking-column box.  And it turns out it's a
brazilian
	box, so you have to use a later (73+) pitman arm.  How much to send
in my
	box and have it rebuilt?  $350.  How much to rebuild a normal box?
$250.
	Why?  No adequate explanation was forthcoming.  I need to learn how
to do
	this.  Any ideas where to get the bushings?  The actual problem is
in the
	&quot;output shaft&quot; of the box - that's where the slop is.  This is the
second
	one I've seen like this.  I'm wondering if this isn't a box that was
	already rebuilt, possibly poorly, as all of the other sloppy ones
I've seen
	had the slop &quot;farther in&quot; in the box, and not in the output shaft.
