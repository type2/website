Dave-

If I read this correctly you are talking about the bearing cover 
inside the brake drum that is held on by 4 14mm headed  bolts?  
The cover that sandwiches the brake backing plate to the axle 
overtube?  If so there should have been a small O-ring between 
the outer axle spacer and the bearing.  They sometimes get 
overlooked when taking axles off and can get rolled under the 
inner bearing race getting trapped between that and the axle.  
This can lead to difficult removal of the axle overtube and 
bearing from the axle itself.  Maybe I misunderstood??
