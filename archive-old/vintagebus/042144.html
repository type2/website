&gt; In the B*g we had a Cobra 29, tweaked &amp; peaked, running thru a Texas Star 350
&gt; watt bi-linear amp w/102 inch steel whip antenna... could talk for more than 50
&gt; miles.

All good, except for the linear.  Since they are illegal anyway, there's
no reason why the backroom &quot;manufacturers&quot; need to make them have a clean 
signal. Figure on wiping out several adjacent CB channels and your
neighbor's TV reception if you use one of these things.  A legal 500W
amateur amplifier can cost $1000.  A CB amplifier that costs a fraction of
that amount is obviously leaving something out!

BTW, the FCC is _serious_ about violations these days, as Riley 
Hollingsworth is handing out $5000 fines with regularity.  Activities such
as illegal CB amplifiers that used to just get your gear confiscated now
result in some major financial pain.

Using 350W to talk 50 miles is excessive anyway.  My _legal_ amateur
transmitter is only 100W, and I've talked to North Carolina with it while 
mobile in SoCal. It's not uncommon for amateurs to work overseas stations
from mobile rigs.  I could legally run 1500W, but there's no point to it.

It's an easy mod to open up the transmit of my Icom 706 to allow operation
on the CB bands with a clean 100W signal, but I won't do it.  It's just
not worth the risk. I have an old CB rig that I put in the bus if I need
to talk on those frequencies.

If you want a CB installation for caravanning, keep it simple and cheap.
The only thing that a CB linear will buy you is trouble.
