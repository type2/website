AHHH, yes, I found the metal brakeline.  It WAS on the outside of the pan.
Now, I still can't find the darn wiring harness.  But then again, I haven't
been able to even get the engine cover open either (not that it has anything
to do with it, just that I'm struggling with these Type II's).  I WAS a bug
guy until I got the panel. Now I'm just working towards the day of my FIRST
ride in a bus.

Thanks

P.S.  Would be interested in talking with ANY double door panel owners,
especially where to get resto panels.

&gt; Um, on mine, the metal brake lights go on the *outside* of the belly pan,
&gt; kind of in the L of the main frame rail.
&gt;
&gt; While we're at it, for the wiring, there's a tube that runs inside the
&gt; belly pan for the harness.

&gt; &gt; I have a '64 double door panel bus (walkthrough). I'm in the process of

&gt; &gt; question is this.  I want to replace all of the metal brake lines. But
since
&gt; &gt; my panel has what seems to be a full undercarriage skid plate (it's
factory,
&gt; &gt; I'm guessing for bracing of the double doors on the bus, kinda like the
&gt; &gt; 'vert rails on a bug or Ghia) what's the best way of doing this? It
doesn't
&gt; &gt; seem to bolt on, it looks to be spot welded in place.  Has anyone ever
done
&gt; &gt; this before?? I ALWAYS, replace the complete braking system when I
restore a
&gt; &gt; VW. Being able to go is nice, but being able to STOP is the most
important
&gt; &gt; thing to me.
