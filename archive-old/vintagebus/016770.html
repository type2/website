If the Bentley has an error, so does Tom Wilson's book on rebuilding your VW 
AC engine.  Both say 14 ft-lb; however, if people are breaking studs when 
they try 14, use 7 .  If you don't end up with a vacuum leak then I guess 
your ok.  When I last did this 15 years ago, I don't think I paid any 
attention to torque specifications.  I just tightened until I sensed that 
the gasket was starting to crush and then turned another 30 degrees or so.  
Same thing I do with a spark plug.  Sometimes you need specifications like 
when your reassembling a long block.  Other times all you need is a little 
empathy with what your working on.

&gt;&lt;&lt; Or, the manual has an error... But that would explain it, the t3 gets 14
&gt;ft lb, cuz it
&gt;  hat the DP and thus m10 fasteners.  &gt;&gt;
