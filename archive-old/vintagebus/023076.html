The first time I did it, years ago, I slightly flattened the ridge at the
rop rear of the tank.  When I did it most recently, I didn't have to.

The trick seems to be to finesses the tank in kinda sideways at first, then
slide it over.  I also took advantage of some &quot;flex&quot; in the middle of the
tank pedestal.

&gt;tank so it will fit. Not satisfied with that solution, I went to
&gt;Vintagebus_dot_com and looked at the procedure there. It said nothing about
&gt;having to bang a big dent into the bottom of the tank.
