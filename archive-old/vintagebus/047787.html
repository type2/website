&lt;&lt; From a buyer's prospective I think it'd be better if eBay didnt show what
the
 current bid was on an item and kept everything hidden until the end.  That
way
 if you bid your $75 and someone else bid only $74, they couldnt see that it
 wasnt enough and then bid a few $'s more until they outbid you. &gt;&gt;

This would be okay but how about the auction ends at xx:xx:xx (am/pm) **OR**
10 minutes after the last bid is recieved following xx:xx:xx.  That way there
if some bids 2 seconds before the designated time it adds 10 minutes to the
clock giving others a chance to jump in.  No more last minute bids and makes
you bid the &quot;real&quot; amount the first time.
