Subject: RE: [VB] Re: weird 28 pict (31mpg)

Maybe his first bus was a split.  My panel gets between 23 to 26 mpg average 
weekly with a 1776 and a Weber 2bbl, as far as my odometer is concerned, but 
I average 8 gallons of gas a week, so I would assume that is accurate.  I do 
have big nut redux boxes and a 3.44 r&amp;p.
