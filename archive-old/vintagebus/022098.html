Well, with just Rex Eastman and myself putting along, we only had two minor
mishaps - He had a flat tire on Buzz, the Viper Red Wonder Bus and my
radiator fan switch shorted out on my 84 Westy.  After securing a toggle
switch and a couple connectors (I had extra wire in the tool box) from a
couple of Jerome attendees (many thanks!), I was back in shape for the trip
back, which I am happy to report there were no problems - not bad for a
total of 19 hours driving time one way.

Rex also learned that a Vanagon jack does not work in place of a
standard-issue Bus jack (he forgot to pack his) - the Vanagon jack insert
is round and is too large for the Bus jackpoint.  After the purchase of a
$37.50 floorjack 15 miles away, we were back on the road to Jerome.

Other than that, Rex and I had a great time.  See ya at BBBIII and Jerome IX
