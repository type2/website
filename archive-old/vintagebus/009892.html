I am afraid I may have screwed something up and I need a sanity check on
&quot;normal&quot;.

This weekend I am tackling the rear brakes (never done brakes in my life
before I did the front last weekend).  I pulled, cleaned and put everything
back together (less the drums) yesterday.  Had to stop there last night;
something about my wife making me have a social life.

This AM I went out and there were a couple of puddles at the point where the
tranny boot connects to the transaxle.  I noticed that the clamp was a
little (half turn or so) loose.  It never leaked before; I tightened it.

Is it possible I caused some back pressure on the transaxle when I took
everything apart?  I did not go beyond the drum (didnt take off the 4
bolts).  Would I expect this leakage to happen if the boot clamp was a
little loose?

Thanks again; Rich
