Subject: Re: [VB] Best Guess, timing

Interesting problem. I have a progressive on my 1776. Had it on a 1600 too. 
Never ran for poop (had it almost 20 years) until I discovered that the 2nd 
barrel was open just a crack. Turned the stop screw about 1/4 turn to close 
it. Runs great now. Always had a problem trying to use the idle circuit 
needle valve.

Re 009: Just get your rpm's down below where the centrifugal advance starts 
to cut in and set your timing. If the rpms are too high, the timing will 
jump around. I also looked at my full advance timing and it's set at about 
32 or 34. You may need different for a 1.8 being that its a different animal 
than my 1776.

Good luck.

Chris
&gt; Anyone have any ideas as to timing a 75 1.8 with a 009 and a Weber 
&gt; progressive?
