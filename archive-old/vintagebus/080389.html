  engine swap  in a splitty bus

Have you checked out the throttle plate modification for the 34 PICT-3
carb to run with the 009? You need to solder the hole in the throttle
plate and re-tune to regain your vacuum at idle with a mechanical
advance distributor instaed of the original vacuum advance distributor
the 34 PICT-3 was designed for. Do you have the two or three vacuum
ports on the carb blocked also?

I have a 1964 VW Splitty (converted to 12 volts), and the original 1500
engine
(with dual port heads) is just not cooperating.   I can't seem to get it
to
idle (after the engine warms), and I have had mechanic friends (although
not
&quot;aircooled VW&quot; mechanics) take a stab at it to help correct this
problem.   I
have recently set all the valves _at_ .006&quot;, and have converted the 009
dizzy to
the &quot;pointless&quot; system.   The heads are a fresh rebuilt set, and I have
a
brand new 34 PICT 3 carb on top.
