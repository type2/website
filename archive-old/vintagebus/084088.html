Subject: re:loose #2 rocker arm

Well I called Bob at Boston Engine(where I got my engine).

He was pretty helpful. Bob said it sounded like the wavy washer/spring
washer probably disintegrated, and got sucked down the push-rod tube; and is
now sitting at the bottom of the engine. This would explain why I didn't see
anything in the valve cover. He said it isn't really doing any harm there-so
not to worry about it.

He sent me two new spring washers. I just installed one. It took all of
about 15 minutes. I imagine this loose rocker arm is why I was getting
problems with overheating recently while on the highway for any stretch...
