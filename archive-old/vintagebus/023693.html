Subject: Thanks! for the CR info.

A big hearty thanks (!) to everyone who responded about my compression
ratio question. I'm going to go with a 6.9:1 if not a 6.6:1 ratio after
I speak with the owner about it.
	I am impressed with how much a little increase in CR can add to the
extra heat and wear, etc., that the engine has to deal with. With some
of the high temp figures i have seen on the list... the lows associated
with the lower CRs sound much more attractive.
	For hindsight: I read really fast... but sometimes I don't retain
everything I read. I read my Berg books several times, each time in one
sitting... If I had reread them, I wouldn't have posted to begin with.
The same is true for the Sermons... I could have at least remembered the
recommended CR limit if I had paid more attention to those sections.
	So... some have said that the more you know, the more you understand
how limited your knowledge is... (something like that). I'll admit I
have been a little uppity of late, thinking I had all my VW s***
together and so on... and perhaps needed a stark message to get back to
some of the basics. (like in the form of a few &quot;you have searched the
Sermons, right?&quot; e-mails...) After I calmed down and went back through
the material, I saw some things I had indeed hurried through... 
	Really, I *am* working on reducing the &quot;panic/spoon-feed-me&quot; reflex...
gotta go now. I've got some technical articles to read.

Thanks!
