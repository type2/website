Kyle,

What a memory!! I already had the schematic. So all those kind replies to
download the wiring diagram from Thom's page didn't really complete the
puzzle. When you've got an empty shell with a harness lying there, its tough
to decide which wires go where. You're a hero!!

p.s. With a memory like that, have you ever considered blackjack??

&gt;Is there a drawing of the bus somewhere which shows the harnesses and where
&gt;they run? I checked the archives and couldn't find anything.

&quot;Not that I know of. Let me think, the main harness comes from the drivers
side dash area across in front of the heater tube and down through a hole in
front of the passengers side kick panel, then goes back inside the passenger
side frame rail in little bendy clips that are spot welded in there. Back
over the transaxle, beside the starter there should be two fairly large
wires sticking out of the harness, a white one with black stripes and a red
one. These are about #8 wire and go to the solenoid, eyelet to the power
stud, female spade to the male spade. In front the white and black one goes
on the ignition switch and the red one goes on the light switch. Positive
battery cable runs to the starter through one hole, harness goes through the
other of the two grommeted holes in the firewall, then splits. The smaller
loom has just a black wire and a thinner blue one with green stripes, I
think. Black one goes to your coil, choke heater, and idle cutoff solenoid,
if so equipped, and the little blue/green one goes to the oil pressure
switch. Should be a little blue wire peeking out there somewhere that goes
on the voltage regulator, and a long skinny brown one that goes to the fuel
guage sender. The larger loom has all your turn signals, brake lights and
taillight wires in it. Wires branch off for the passenger side lights, then
over the top of the engine hatch frame in more bendy clips. The passenger
side taillight wire has another wire in a sleeve coming off it that runs
along with the others to the center of the engine lid for the license plate
light, should be a ground wire for it screwed to the frame there, too. Then
over to the drivers side lights. That's the best I can do by memory, but the
diagrams should finish it up. Not for sure if this is really what you
wanted, but what the hey...&quot;
