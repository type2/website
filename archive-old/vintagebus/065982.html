Hi Tom,
After getting the thing Ray suggested done first you might want to install a 
1968-71 bus tank with 15 gallon capacity instead of the earlier 10 gallon.  
We also install a reserve switch in all our buses and even if there is no 
reserve switch cable in post-1960 buses one can slide under and switch to the 
reserve in a pinch!
