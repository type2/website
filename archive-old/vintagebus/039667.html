Good Morning List!

Just wanted to get some suggestions as to what I should look at on my 
brakes.  Here is the situation.  When you press on the brake pedal it 
becomes stiffer and stiffer to press.   Also the brakes at the wheel don't 
release pressure after you have let up on the brake pedal.  This continues 
for a few pedal pumps until the brakes are completely locked up.   Then when 
you go to one of the wheel and open the bleeder port the brakes release.   I 
have removed the master cylinder and that moves freely.  What else could 
cause the brake system to not releave pressure when you take your foot off 
the pedal.

I heard once that it could be the flexible lines by the wheel ends swelling 
and not releiving pressure.   Is this possible?

In case it matters...   The vehicle is a 61 split with a single circuit 
master cyclinder.  Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Mike Lynch
