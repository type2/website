Subject: Re: [VB] Bosch distributor testing machine

I wish I still had my old Sun dist machine..... sold it when I closed my shop
back in 1978. The Sun unit had a built-in vacuum pump and gauge so you could
test vacuum advances.

This Bosch unit appears to only be good for 009's and the centrifugal advance
of dual advance distributors. It would not work on vac advance only
distributors.


&gt; Wasn't someone looking for one of these?
