It's kinda funny - you thinking of drilling drain holes in the front floor.   
Seems all the buses I have seen came with holes there.  Definately buses with 
safaris.  In fact, the package tray in my 65 (had OG safaris- ha I tossed 
them) had holes in it like swiss cheese.   wasn't this an MX code?

 &gt;I understand about the floors - I'm thinking of applying the same
 &gt;treatment [drilling drain holes] to the low spots in the front floors,
 &gt;giving the water a path all the way out of the car.
 
 Small drain holes would probably work good in the ribs and not let too
 much in from the outside, especially if the pedal pan is still there.
 
 One idea for bigger drain holes - (vintage fanatics, hit 'Next' now)
 drill a 1/2&quot; or so hole in a couple of spots, weld on a 2&quot; piece of
 1/2&quot; electrical conduit, drill hole in conduit wall and install old
 type road draft tube rubber valve.  Water gets out but it doesn't
 get in.
