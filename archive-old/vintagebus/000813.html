All--
Well, I have been lurking on this list for a couple of months, but didn't 
have much to say, especially since I didn't own a Type II at all.  In my 
distant past, I owned a split Westphalia which was very rusty; also more 
recently a 1971 Westphalia, now gone.

For some time, I had been looking for a single cab.  Well, finally one 
appeared in my local newspaper, and it was about 40 miles from me.  It is a 
1967, complete less motor and windshield, rust very minor (confined to 
rockers below storage box).  A second Type II, a 1966 walk-through, was 
included in the deal, &quot;for parts.&quot;  It may be worth fixing too!

Spent all day yesterday driving back the forth in a Dodge van pulling a car 
trailer, to bring these two home.  Will probably have lots of questions, but 
do have the manual, thanks to Steve Howell.

One questions:  What are the considerations in adding safari windows?  Is 
there more than one manufacturer, making different qualities at different 
prices, as in beetle bumpers?  Are originals available?  Can they be 
distinguished from the repops?  Are they worth the difference in price, if 
any, for a &quot;casual restoration? stock-appearing restification, that is?
