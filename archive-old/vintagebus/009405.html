Hi all,

Some of you might recall about a year ago a post I made about a white 67 crew cab that a customer of mine got in trade for some work.  Some of you already knew about it.  It's rough but worth saving, was a daily driver and probably could be again but the brakes need fixing.  Anyway, those who knew something about it responded that they thought $1000 was the higher side of a fair price for the bus, and that's what he's lowered his price to, so I thought I'd re-post in case anyone's interested in it.  I'd be real surprised if he took less, but he mentioned that he'd be willing to trade for a decent rail buggy with no problems, as he likes them but has no time to fix a non-runner right now.

If you're interested, p-mail me and I'll pass along his phone numbers.  I have a couple of photos of it somewhere I could scan and mail too for that matter.

Keep 'em driving,
Curt
