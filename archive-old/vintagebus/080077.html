Subject: re:Plastic Shift rod bushing

I don't know if the year matters-but my '65 has one of these. It was cracked
when I bought the bus(I think it's also cracked on my squareback). I didn't
know it at the time, and didn't until a couple years later.

To see it you need to remove the pedal pan, then look near the base of the
shifter and follow the rod-on mine the bushing was still in place, but it
was obvious it was cracked. 

When I replaced it-the bus shifting was much much much did I say much
smoother! Overall it wasn't that hard a fix...it helps to have a second
person when re-installing the shifter...although not absolutely necessary.
