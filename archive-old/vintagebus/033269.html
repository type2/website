  Hi everybody
      I'm almost to the point of starting to put the 57 singlecab (early) 
back together but there are a few things that I need to get it running by the 
spring. I know that you can pay what someone is asking if you want it BAD 
enough, but I am curious on what the fair price would be on a few things 
before I start buying. Especially after major $$$$ on bodywork to the resto 
shop. The funds are alot leaner as everyone knows. But anyway here's the 
list: 
                 Front bumper (ribbed)
                 engine compartment door and crank hole apron
                 bubble tail lights (decent )
                 speedo 
                 canopy hoops (this seems like a lost cause but if someone 
has the specs and a pic or 2 I'll get them fabricated)
                 barndoor steering wheel 
                 divider for gas tank/lower compartment

   If anyone happens to have any of the above please let me know. I'll post 
some pics when it gets back together                                Thanks 
                                                                      Steve
