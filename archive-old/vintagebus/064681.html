&gt; what do you think of using pvc pipe to replace heater tube on a bus ???
&gt; any better ideas ????  

Hi John,
With our heater output we would be worried of it melting and outgassing nasty 
chemicals.  We would try using zinc plated stove pipe that has the seam 
instead.  Just cut down the diameter of the stove pipe after seperating the 
seam.  Then install two lengths of this modified tubing with a short coupling 
section fitted on the centerish seam between the two longer tubes you have 
made.  Spot weld the pipes together (Be carefull of zinc fumes they are not 
good for your liver!! You can rig up a throughly cleaned out old vacuum 
cleaner with hose for a fresh air pump to your face.) and after zinc 
primering the welds perhaps carefully apply a spray foam (Tape up plastic to 
keep the foam from sticking in places you do not want.) to the outside of new 
the heater tube or some other insulation that should handle heat.
