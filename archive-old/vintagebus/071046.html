Subject: Re: [VB] another good day for the bus!

I live in a subdivision and don't get any nasty letters or complaints when I
pull the motor in my driveway.  Maybe the people in my subdivision just like
me...

&gt; I
&gt; dream of a shop someday where I can roll the bus into and work on it. At
&gt; least I don't live in a subdivision where I'd be be getting all kinds of
&gt; nastygrams for pulling my engine out in my front yard!!Maybe when we get
to
&gt; Kansas I'll have one.....Well , that's it for the night! Hope everyone had
a
&gt; good weekend!
&gt;         Kind Regards, Jason
