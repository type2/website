Subject: heads up!

I pulled Stella's motor yesterday to see why the #4 exhaust valve was
giving me trouble.  there were bits of crap underneath the valve cover
and I could push the valve in with my fingers and wiggle it
around...which I knew wasn't a good sign.
Many hours later I pulled the head and took out the valve (without a
valve spring compressor...thats how bad it was)  and when the valve came
out, the valve guide followed.....in 2 pieces. It just fell out.  That
can't be good!  I've never heard of that happening...and I don't know
why it happened.  The seat still seems good and all...just the guide was
trashed...and probably the spring.  the guide was rather beat up
too...with rigid ends which was probably the crap I was finding
underneath the valve cover.
Its kind of scary....I've never had Stella's motor taken apart this far.

I went last night and bought a frozen up motor with good heads and a
good case so I could use the heads.  It still has a lot of good
parts...and I got a deal on it.

Now to clean up a head and reassemble!

more when thats done...
