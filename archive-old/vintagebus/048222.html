Ken, Split list, 

&gt;&gt;This needs to be posted to all the VW lists that touch busses (if it's okay
with those lists of course) and to the newsgroup, regularly.&lt;&lt;

Seems to me that folks on ebay who might not know of the type2 library, would 
probably not be subscribers to any list.  What I mean is that list 
subscribers are probably not your intended audience.  You want to get the 
person new to the hobby, and list subsribers probably already know where to 
get good cheep information.

Seems like a newbie might look at yahoo for bus info.  At yahoo's editied 
catagories:
http://dir.yahoo_dot_com/Recreation/Automotive/Makes_and_Models/Volkswagen/Models/

Buses__Vans__Campers__etc_/ 

Lists the following:

VintageBus - devoted exclusively to Volkswagen buses built from 1949 to 1967. 
VW Barndoor Page - lots of history and photos. 
VW Bus Mailing List 
VW Planet 

Note that Everett's &quot;VW planet&quot; and your (Ken's) &quot;VW Bus Mailing List&quot; has no 
description after the link.  Submitting additional info to Yahoo might be 
good, although it will be ages before they post it.

Also, if we are trying to reach ebay folks, I might suggest that folks add a 
link to type2_dot_com or a links site like Bill's
http://www.geocities_dot_com/billberckman/1fweem.html
on the ebay &quot;about me&quot; feature.

As for the newsgroup, don't they regurlarly publish or have available a FAQ?  
Getting info on there might be helpful, and it is regularly published.

I remember before the lists split, there was a regular weekly post for bus 
resources.  I get the impression that is what Ken is aiming at.  It went 
along with the weekly stats that Uncle Joe use to post.  I miss the old stats 
since the split.  I assume you folks still have thoes stats on the bay list.  
I guess there was a person in Canada (Jean... something, sorry that I foget, 
my apologizes) who had a web site where list members could list information 
about themselves.  Thom has something similar at 
http://vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/listee.html
(non frame), to hich I will now add myself.

I don't have too much simpathy for ebay folks who waste $10 since they are 
eiter too lazy or ignorant to doo a through web search for information they 
need.  Maybe they don't have a printer and just wanted to get the info to 
take on the road...sure.
