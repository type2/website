On the M  plate just below the gas tank the VIN# 1071349. 


Hi Seth,
On pre-1964 chassi numbers you can not tell the model from.  Instead  check 
in the engine compartment on the left side of the engine, and just forward  of 
it.  There should be a plate held there with two screws.  What is  the model 
number there???
