Good Luck Andre----

The reason I chose Sealing Wax Red is simple:
1) Red is my favorite color on my VW's (I have a red w/ tan top '74 
convertible)
2)It was the original color on my panel and you really don't see too many 
panels wit      this color originally compared to, for example, dove blue.

--It seems as though the midwest is gonna see quite a large number of &quot;new&quot; 
busses on the show scene!!! It'll be a good summer:)

Take care everyone--
Pete
