  I just made two setups last week.
I had two junk trannys laying around and i cut both at the studs for the side 
plates, one i welded up a 2 leg frame and bolted it to the studs, the engine 
sits about 6&quot; off the ground, i might put wheels on it later.
and the other one i welded up a piece to fit into the engine stand, now i can 
run it on the portable stand or on my bench stand.

It sure bets putting everything on the vehicle.
now i can find leaks or problems easilly.


just my 2 cents worth for the day.
