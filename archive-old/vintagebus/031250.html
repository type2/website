Subject: Summer travel of P &amp; C

We are getting ready to head out for our summer travel as soon as we
finish servicing and fixing the bus.  The one year old german throw out
bearing is beginning to talk so that will be replaced, and the one year
old axle boot has decided to start leaking.  Too bad you cannot get
longer lasting repair/replacement parts.  So tomorrow we pull the
engine.  We got a new throw out bearing with a Pomona deal on a case. 
It is marked IND BRASS and part number P-1010.  Any one know about
these?

We will of course be camping out in the VW bus.  We will cruise up the
east side of the Sierras headed north to a family gathering in Gold
Beach, Oregon on 13-15 July and we plan to visit Clara up in Olympia and
non-VW friends in Bremerton WA.  Left lots of time to play and visit.

Probably head south again in mid august, with a swing into the San
Francisco area.  Then we will cross over to Hwy 49 and hope to hook up
with Britt and Kaitlin.  Then travel south, visiting National Parks and
checking out sites as we cruise. 

If any one has any suggestions, or know of camp outs, shows, or junk
yards, or just wants to visit let us know.  We are planning to leave
around 4 July, or whenever the bus work is done, but we hope to have
some email connections enroute.  We have the AIRS lists with us and hope
not to have to use them except for non-emergency visits.

Spotted another 60 panel cruising around here in Hesperia, a little
rough but on the road.  We chatted a bit and shared repairs and ideas. 
He was buying Napa rebuild kits ($13 for the fronts) for the front
brakes while we were getting the GL-4 (also about $13).

And of course there will be Jerome and Busses and Balloons later in the
travel plans.
