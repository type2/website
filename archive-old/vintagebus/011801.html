&gt; I looked at this and looked at the head. I figured I was now going to have to buy another head, but I kept thinking about how I might fix this. I remembered Bob taking about scoring metal to raise it a little. I didn't remember the context, but I knew this was probably a good application of that concept. So...with nothing to loose, I tried it. After a couple of failed attempts--do not use a hammer directly on the guide as this bends it slightly; use a block of wood and light taps--this is what I did:

Sorry, but your fix is not going to last very long.  What you did is referred to
as &quot;broaching&quot; and now you have even less material to support the valve stem.
