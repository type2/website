I have not seen any mention of this show so I thought I would let everyone
know.
Bow-Wow Auto parts is having there annual show at Bellevue community college
this Sunday.
As a huge Bonus the Pacific Northwest Thing Association will be joining them
for there annual show. (most active thing club in the US)
Traditionally this show has had a pretty good bus turn out. Hopefully though
this year it will be even better!!!
