What do you mean too bad about the rhd?  I really want a rhd bus, but don't
have any money at the moment, which kinda puts a strain on getting one...


&gt;   Saw this on Samba, really like the layout, excellent condition, too bad
&gt; the rhd, anyone seen this Canterbury Pitt conversion before? I would say
&gt; it has many neat ideas.  Full disclosure; not anyway connected with
&gt; seller.
