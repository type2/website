Hello everyone,
My bus is a 67 with the original tranny.  When It is idling in neutral and I 
release the clutch I hear a loud growling noise coming from the tranny.  It 
shifts easily, and doesn't pop out of any gears.  I can't hear the noise 
while the bus is moving but this may be because it is moving and the noise 
is masked.  Any ideas what it may be? If the tranny is shot I need to start 
looking for one.
Boyd Smith
67 Westy
