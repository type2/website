&lt;&lt; I've checked the archives and  found nothing. Does anyone know what the
 proper color for the bumpers on a   66 deluxe painted pearlwies (L 87) and
 velvet green. i'm not sure if they should match the top color or just be
 bright white.
 pete 66 deluxe
         76 westy &gt;&gt;

The correct color is Silver White. I do not know the number off hand, but
would hate to see you paint the bumpers body color.
