Subject: unknown engine reliability

I have only been involved with this group a week or so but I have read more
than a few messages in regards to the reliability of unknown engines.  The
best way to get the best info on an unknown engine is a simple compression
check.  Compression will tell you what's going on inside and whether it is
smart to depend on your engine for a long trip.  I check my compression at
every oil change and keep a record of it.  This allows me to see if a
problem is developing and if so how fast it is degrading.  If you do not
have a compression tester I feel that it is time to get one and learn to use
it.  If I remember John Muir gives a good explanation on how to read the
numbers along with different tests to figure out the problem is rings,
valves, or both.
