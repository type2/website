&gt; Did Euro Trucks have black or white interior pieces? (Knobs, handles,

&gt; black t/s switch, white column, black steering lock / ign., white knobs
&gt; and white inside door handles handles.

I've seen it both ways; what year is the truck?  The late ones seem 
to have white accessories, and the early ones black.

&gt; The truck has the original Euro bumpers, steering lock, and Euro
&gt; headlight lenses, but no sign of Euro tail lights or the t/s switch to
&gt; go with them. Any ideas??

What year is the truck again?  Someone may have converted to the US
6-wire over the 3-wire, so they'd have blinkies.

&gt; The truck also has the spare tie mounted in a cradle under the bed
&gt; (pictures tomorrow) I've seen this twice before. Once in either Thom or
&gt; Everett's galleries and in the latest issue of Hot VW's. Is this a VW
&gt; option, and if so what is the m-code? I have must of them sorted out,
&gt; but I don't see this one.....

I think that was common ontrucks with 2 cargo doors.
