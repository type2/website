Subject: Re:  [VB] HELP  my oil cooler exploded , again .....
To: Vwbus58_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

makes me wonder if you are using the heavy duty oil pressure relief springs, 
and what weight oil you are using.    

even with 30 wt oil here, my oil pressure in my 65 goes up to about 50 or 60 
at lidle when I start it up in the morning.

check to make sure you have stock spings, and you are using a suitable weight 
oil for you climate.

after realizing it was the cooler &lt;stock&gt;  I pulled the motor and put another 
oil cooler on. &lt;used ,but good shape&gt;  I reinstalled the motor and was 
driving it only 
hours later and it ran well for about 100 more miles and then The replacement 
cooler
blew out yesterday . I dont think that both of the coolers are bad , so what 
was causing this to happen ?    obviously my oil pressure is building up  but 
why ?
