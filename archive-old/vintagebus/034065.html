Hi Jon,
This will not be fast enough to meet your deadline, but we are modifying the
stock dog house shrouds to install the 40% bigger type 4 cooler on the type 1
engine.  $45.00 with the trade in of your three doghouse tin pieces, or if
you are not in the NW of USA, $100.00 which includes shipping to all parts of
USA with only the trade in of your L-shaped sealing bracket that bolts around
the base of the doghouse cooler.  Eric&amp;Barb
