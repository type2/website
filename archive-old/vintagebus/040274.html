Hey Hey,

Not sure...I've got a 66 transaxle thats been hogged out to accomidate a 
200m 12v fly wheel and just put in a 12v starter in last weekend.  I had to 
do what busboys recomended and put in a 12vto 6v starter bushing.  Could be 
wrong but I believe 6v trannys have a bigger hole than 12v for the starter 
bushing.  So if the starter is too big than possibly you don't have a bus 
starter at all.  just my .5 cents sure you'll get more bank from a fellow 
listee.

&gt;i have a rebuilt bosch starter that i thought would
&gt;fit into my 1966 tranny, but it is definitely too
&gt;large to mount onto the tranny. &gt;bosch
&gt;made in germany
