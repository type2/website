Hi Josh,
Where exactly is the carb leaking from?  We agree with Clara that as long as 
the bore the lower shaft turns in is not worn out the carb is almost certainly 
rebuildable.  Only the electric choke and idle fuel solinoid shut off valves 
are either 6 o 12 volt, and since these can be replaced the carb can be 
changed to work on either voltage.  Getting a copy of the &quot;Volkwagen Service Manual 
Type 1&quot; printed by Bentley for the 1968-79 bug is very helpfull with good info 
and lots of very well done photos.  The latter which really helps when you go 
to put the carb back together!
