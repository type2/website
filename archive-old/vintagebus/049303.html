Death-ray? How about a healthy spark gap emitting RF in all directions? Mount it outside the vehicle and watch the fun. 

Lisa and Todd are listees and were at the Madera show in their beautiful '60 DC. 

I hooked up with a local legendary VW expert, Dennis Sullivan, he's agreed to metal-wiz my 21w. Progress, finally, I'lll be stripping the 21w over the next few days for replacement of the entire left side below the belt. 

Tent washing.... you're allowed to dilute bleach or simple green as much as you want. Water it to nearly nothing, soak for a few minutes and try again if it's not enough to kill the stain or odor.  How about camper's seam sealer? Would that protect the stitching from the bleach or just general weakening? Also, if we can buy SPF 30 sunscreen for sensitive skin, is there a fabric treatment to do the same?
