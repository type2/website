Yesterday I posted a message about Gabriels key shop.  Last night I called
and talked to him.
He does the VW key thing as a side hobby, and is a member of S.O.T.O.
He attends quite a few VW events and does key repairs/cutting on the spot.
To give you an idea of what his prices are this is what he's
doing/charging me for my '66 Westy.
He will cut a key (original N.O.S.) for my ignition, then he will use new
pins in the front door lock assemblies, the cargo door and the rear hatch
so that all five cylinders use the same key.  He charges $20/key for the
ones I want and $10/ cylinder.
So I'll spend $50 for the cylinders to have new pins installed and set up
for the single key operation, get 2 new keys for another $40.  $90 total.
Some may think it's too much, but it cost me $50 to have a locksmith come
out at 10PM to open my car door.  Keys were inside...:(
I didn't even get a key for that price!!!!
later
