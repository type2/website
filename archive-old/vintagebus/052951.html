 I've really been having a tough time starting my bus these days.  I just 
keep turning it over again, and again and again and again and again and 
eventually it starts.  I set the points, the timing, etc.. it just takes a 
long time to get it running?  I drove my bus last winter on occasion and it 
wasn't near this tough to get started and it was much colder than these last 
couple of days.  Once it's running and warm it will restart ok but it's that 
initial started that's a b*tch. I'm running 20-50 oil and I'm thinking about 
going to 5 - 30 for the winter (not that I'll drive my bus much anyway in the 
winter).  I wonder if that will help?

 Where are you - what is your climate?  It may make sense to use thinner oil. 
but I dunno it that is your problem.  Checking the spark is good- blue/white  
better than orange/yellow.   When I start the VW I press the gas pedal 
downbefore turning the key, and then again as the engine starts to turn 
round.  If I don't it can be slow to start.

climate here- lows in mid 30s, highs in mid 40s, raining.   running 30wt in 
the 1600sp, pre heat attached (crucial in this climate)
