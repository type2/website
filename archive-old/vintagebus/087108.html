Subject: Re:Front Beam

Hi,

I think we had a discussion on this maybe 4 years ago or so. If I  
recall correctly, we came to the conclusion that 68-69 were bolt-in  
and '70 were slightly narrower but would fit with some modification.  
Search the archives for more info. i.e. The later front beams will  
raise the front of the bus. And make sure you &quot;load up&quot; the beam as  
you tighten the bolts so that you do not shear the bolts when you slam  
on the brakes.

Conrad
