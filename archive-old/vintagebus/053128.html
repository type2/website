&gt; Hi everyone! I've come to the point that I've got to
&gt; sell my 62 Bus, It's a 
&gt; red kombi with white bumpers , primered cargo
&gt; section and so on, all stock 
&gt; looking. I drove it daily until winter set in then
&gt; took it off the road to 
&gt; drive my old Jetta (heat).  I've done alot of
&gt; bodywork on it, which were cab 
&gt; floors, rockers, left dog leg, new window gaskets.
&gt; It still needs some work 
&gt; underneath, but structurally the bus is fine. It's
&gt; very presentable! It runs 
&gt; well and has new brakes all around including hoses
&gt; and lines. I'm asking 1800 
&gt; for it, more than what I've got into it. But I've
&gt; got another car on the way 
&gt; and cant have everything, so this one has to go. I'm
&gt; located in western MA, 
&gt; incidently. Thanks!
&gt;
