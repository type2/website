&gt; Hey all. Can anyone tell me what the extra wire leading all the way back
&gt; along the roof line and down out near the rear hatch hooks up to. This
&gt; is for a 58 Deluxe. Is it for a heated rear window? It is a factory wire
&gt; and I have seen them on other buses but was just curious cause I've
&gt; never seen it hooked up. Also there is no mount for an extra dome light
&gt; so I figured it wasn't for that.
&gt; Thanks
wow! that just gave me a great idea. in theory, you could take a heated rear
window out of a baywindow to replace the 63-67 rear window, couldn't you? i
could even use my havard switch that doesn't work. and it wouldn't even be a
hack job!

just a random thought that i thought i'd share.
