Subject: RE: [VB] speaking of tires

I found a set of American racing 'Baja Star' wheels... you can see them on
my wheels page:
http://www.dsquared-dev_dot_com/davem/wheels.htm

Some people have told me that these wheels are from the early 60's which
would be really great as I could back date the truck further but others have
said mid to late 60's and possibly early 70's.  The problem with these
wheels is that it looks like I will have to narrow the rear end to make them
fit... but don't worry, I won't cut anything og to the bus, just he axles
and the type 3 lowering kit that's being used so don't flame me ;-)

I can't run Raders (I have some) because of the Porsche 356B brakes which
the wheel won't fit over.  BRMs will fit, Empi GT five spokes will with a
1/2 inch spacer.  The raders would have put me back to 64.  BRMs are about
the same vintage, maybe 65.  The empi GTs are 66 or 67 era.  It's tough to
find stuff in the early 60's for VW applications unless you go with a
porsche rim.

Sean asked: I think your right with the mid sixties guess. You
could also run Radars with Goodyear Bluestreaks! Good
luck finding a set!
 The Cal Look book has pics of some old Bug-Ins and
early racing pics that have photos of old wheel
combos.  Are your american racing rims wide five (vw)? That
will look sweet!
