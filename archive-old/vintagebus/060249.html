I liked your initial post - some people on this list do need to lighten up -
on the other hand it is always important to be respectful because you will
find most people will be respectful to you.  Give the list a chance and
smoke your pipe as much as you like.  You'll also find people will go to
great lengths to help you when you have a problem - so it's a good idea not
to alienate them by name calling.

good luck

&gt; yeah really ....put  down the pipe? jeez, im not a pothead. and if i
&gt; was, i had no common sense before i started smoking,. so LEAVE IT OUT OF
&gt; THIS! and, you, you jerk, i dont really think youre all old and mean.
&gt; just a few of you.
&gt; and i said such things last night because i was putting faith in all of
&gt; you to have a good sense of humor and remember when you were young and
&gt; think &quot;haha, yeah, i AM old...get me some denture cream&quot;  dont take
&gt; life, cars, and especially message boards too seriously. you'll have a
&gt; seizure or go bald or something. (my hair is thinning actually, so i
&gt; know about ALL  THAT) and for the record, i would never ever sell
&gt; anything, (namely my volkswagen) for &quot;alternate medicine&quot; money.
&gt; asshole. in fact, im trying to sell my playstation2, with 2 games, (tony
&gt; hawk3, and grand theft auto 3) with 2 controllers and a memory card for
&gt; $250, and a 13&quot; tv/vcr combo for $75. (with remote!) so if anyone is
&gt; interested please contact me via email and we will arrange shipping
&gt; situations). and im selling this so i can afford things FOR MY BUS. or
&gt; pay some bills so i can afford things FOR MY BUS. so don't assume you
&gt; know who i am. because ill hang myself then, after im good and dead,I'll
&gt; haunt your ass for the rest of your life...(or, ill just write an email
&gt; about it. and you DONT WANT THAT!)  =o\      um, ok so later guys. it
&gt; was nice to spice up the message board a little, and thank you to those
&gt; of you who were cool and helped me out with some info. before i depart
&gt; tho how do i contact this ronnie guy again? boston engine? or was it
&gt; bus-boys? i dont remember. (must be that pipe thats lodged into my
&gt; temple) did anyone see that south park episode when everyone was eating
&gt; with their A-holes and crapping out of their mouths? that was a good one.
&gt;
