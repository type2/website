Subject: Okay, Here is the M-Code Info on the 65
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Got a hold of the M-code info on that 65 I'm considering buying. I have 
figured out some of it, some I'm stumped. Here goes.
29 1 (January 29)
621 (no idea)
425 002 025 091 114 620 (???/???/lap belt anchors/whitewalls/6 popouts/12 
volt)
UA 2812 121783 5097285 (US?/Standard 7-Seater/Sea Blue Blue White Mesh Grey)

What is 425 or 002?

What port is A?

What does the 2 after 281 mean?

Thanks all. Weird that it's 12-volt, guess that was an option on some 65s?

Sue
