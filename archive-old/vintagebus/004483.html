&gt; This is an older link to a site maintained by Telly King.

&gt; It is a late model 1303 with a 1.8 liter Subaru motor shoehorned into
&gt; the engine compartment. It's actually a surprisingly good fit!

Wow!  That IS a great fit.  Looks to me like this would make a great engine
to put in a split or baywindow bus.  If it'll fit a bug that easy, a bus is
no problem.  You could make a radiator to fit the decklid area and have a
nice compact watercooled powerplant. :-)

Is that sacreligeous? :-)
