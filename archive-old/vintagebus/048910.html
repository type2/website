Seems like Clara hit on most everything.  A few more minutia details, feel free to nail me if I'm wrong:

Pop-Outs - Pre 1963 Double Cabs had the horizontal style mount on the   window frame with dark brown/black latch *knobs*.

Front Seats - Bench Style until '64 I think, although '62 was a one year only adjustable bench seat.  Then 1/3, 2/3 split seat with adjustable driver's seat.

Engine Lid - Church key thru '65, then push button latch.  Spring style hold open came out in late '64 or early '65.
