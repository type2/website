&gt; I can relate to Dan's point in a way, i have had several people wanting cargo
&gt; floor sections used that is, to be perfectly honest for the time cost of
&gt; pulling the damn things you can buy floor halfs, so not to be rude but i'm
&gt; not gonna pull'em,it might be good metal but geez the labor of pulling one
&gt; out to salvage it would outweigh the income.

And on that note I'd like to say that DAN contacted me awhile back about $15.00
cargo doors I had listed on my site for sale. He wanted me to send him pictures,
get a shipping cost, etc..............

I explained to him that I was busy doing one of my construction projects and
wouldn't really have the time to do all that. In fact everytime he called me I
was on site and not at the shop. Free time was not something I had and packing
them for shipping wasn't something I would have time to do. Especially not for
$15.00. In the meantime another list member contacted me, drove to my house and
bought 2 of the doors. No problem. When Dan found out about this he got angry
with me sent a couple nasty emails, etc. I pointed out to him again the problems
with time etc. He then said he would have someone local to me come by and pick
them up for him. Cool, a few phone calls between me and his contact, a date was
set....................no one showed. More calls were made and the last contact I
had was leaving him a message to get ahold of me about the doors. Haven't heard
from him since. This has been quite awhile ago...................Since then
another list member had someone pick up the doors for him. Doors gone!!

Forward to Dans post of parts for sale................I wanted some pieces for a
Bus I'm doing. I contacted him about the pieces as soon as the post was
made(within 2  minutes)....................no response for at least 2 days,
inquired again...........got an email saying I wasn't the first t reply and he
sold them elsewhere..............sure, OK, that's believable....RIGHT!!

Then a week or so later he post to the list how &quot;some guy&quot; wouldn't come through
for him with some doors so why would he come through for him. I kept quite and
put Dan on my &quot;Don't do business with list&quot;

It seems to me he has now changed his tune from &quot;You need to do anything to help
me!!&quot; to &quot;I'm too busy to help you&quot; when in fact he was upset that I, with 2
businesses, buying and moving to a new house/shop couldn't take care of him ASAP
and even held the parts he wanted so someone else could pick them up for him(they
never showed).

Point being $15.00 wasn't worth the time I would have had to go through to ship
the doors, that's why I wanted them picked up. When Dan didn't get his way he
complained. Now that the shoe is on the other foot and he is asked has to go out
of his way he won't. He expects people to drop everything to help him but will
take his sweet time helping others...................pretty shady if ask me.
