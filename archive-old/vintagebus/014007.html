Message-ID: &lt;19991116031133.56777.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

hello all    hey  i have a question,    is it worth all the trouble sense i 
am getting my bus painted to go ahead and get all new rubber around all the 
windows even though none of them leak now, but they look pretty bad,   and 
also, if i should replace the rubber, how difficult is it and are there any 
hints on how to keep the job as easy and simple as possible.

thanks for all your help\
