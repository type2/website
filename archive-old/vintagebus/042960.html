sells the bolts you need, I just bought some for the work I am getting
ready to start on. 


&gt; question is where can I get one of these pullers?  Does Grainger have one
&gt; that works, or do I order it from Harbor Freight?
&gt; 

I believe that neither HF or G's has anything like what we need. I have
been researching around, and have found a tool which will be able to
remove the upper outer 6305 ball bearing from the upper shaft after
removing the reduction box outer cover, and the retaining ring. It may be
called a 'clamshell' puller. IT has two halves which are curved and get
thinner towards the center,so that they can grip around behind the
bearing. You then pull using your standard two arm puller. Or you can bolt
a push-puller onto the front of it and pull that way. It will also remove
the N207E ROLLER bearing (not BALL) from the outer lower shaft end. You
will of course need a 7 inch reach puller on that job, or a pair of long
bolts for your push-puller unit. 

I have also been told that I can remove both above bearings merely by
prying them off using two identical large screwdrivers carefully. You
*will* want to use an appropriate drift to install them. 


To remove the 6306's (inner upper and lower ball bearings),

the lower one can be driven out with a screwdriver and care once you have
disassemble and removed the lower stub axle, from behind. The upper one
needs to be pulled out from infront using a special tool sold by -

Alburqurque Special Tools, Don Pierce, at:
800.338.5374
505.332.1780

The two part tool grips between the inner and outer races of the ball
bearing, and pulls it out. 

His catalog lists the folllowing number and prices:

0242 Ball Bearing Puller (collets available for most bearings), $129.00

242A 8 Finger Collet, for 6306/8  $49.00

be sure to check with him on these numbers and applications first. 

I have also been told that the upper 6306 can be banged out using the axle
itself inserted thru the axle tube and bearing down on the back of the
upper bearing.


&gt; case, I will need those hardened bolts and the special puller, so those
&gt; searches have the top priority.
&gt; 

The above will get you going, but it will cost you a bit. My present need
is just for the clamshell puller, which I will buy from Applied
Technology, Inc, (formerly King Bearings), for $65. The special tool and
collet may become a birthday present for myself in the future.
