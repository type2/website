And my dream you ask - I dream about someday there will be two vintage bus
lists - that's right 2 - A waste of bandwidth you say - No I say.

And you ask why 2 vintage bus lists? - well, in my dream - there is one
vintage bus list for tech stuff - like how do i fix those silly springs in
my door handles.

The other list you ask?  Well the other would be for things like What our
friends are selling, buying, advertising on God D*mn Ebay.   Out what the
latest cr*p toys that that the destroyer of communities Walmart is selling,
why on this second list we could even bash hippies, or french canadians, or
campaingn on behalf of our favorite right wing facist &quot;W.&quot;

A waste of bandwidth - NO - wasted bandwidth is all this crap that I get
about Walmart or Ebay - or the bashing of my fellows ;).


Ah well, that's my dream -
