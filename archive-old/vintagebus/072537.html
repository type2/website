Subject: Re: [VB] Bigger rubber bump-stops on axels...how do they mount?

&gt; Was there a shaft or something that was in the center of the dish that
&gt; the bumper sat one?

I also have a 66 &amp; have lost one myself. It is held on by a &quot;button&quot;
thing IIRC about 25mm in dia. My other one rusted off as well. I plan
on trying to use something like liquid nails or some sort of really
strong adhesive to try &amp; put it back in place. Haven't done so yet, so
I can't say if it works or now.
