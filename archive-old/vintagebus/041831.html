I use a dab of Hylomar on the threads.  Never hardens, but seems to be
thick enough to prevent leaks.

In fact, I use Hylomar on a lot of gasket surfaces.  It really works well
in sealing, but there isn't any hardened sealer to scrape off when the
engine is pulled apart the next time.

VW of Mexico uses Hylomar (or something very similar) on the case parting
line.

You can buy the stuff from the permatex rack at your FLAPS.
