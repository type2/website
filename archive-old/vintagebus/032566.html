bentley and &quot;without guesswork&quot; (by VW) sez:
in (initial torque sequence)--tighten all to 1mkg, or 10nm or (i hate foot
lbs) 7ft.lbs
THEN in FINAL torque sequence--torque M10 nuts to 3.0 to 3.2mkg, or
30-32nm, or (those stupid ft.lbs again) 22-23ft.lbs.
  or M8 nuts to 2.5mkg, or 25nm or (damn ft. lbs again) 18ft. lbs.  in the
specified sequence.  
 PLEASE NOTE: the INITIAL TORQUE SEQUENCE  is  DIFFERENT  from the  FINAL
TORQUE SEQUENCE!!
i've built a few motors, and have talked to alot of old timers, and they
say it's ok to go over, and some even torqued 10mm nuts to 30ft
lbs(whatever THOSE are), but only if the case had been case savered.  the
smaller studs are better alloy and don't stretch as much, hence the lower
torque, but again, some oldtimers with 1000's of motors behind them, say
it's ok to go to about 22-23ft. lbs (can someone explain this american
measurement for a metric application?).
i personally have an 8mm stud engine with 70K+ on it.  have checked torque
many times, never have been loose, and only have them torqued to 30nm
(sorry, don't know stupid ft.lbs of that), which is still over a bit, but
they never have moved, and haven't popped any studs either out of the case,
or broken in half.

&gt; Jon writ:
&gt; &gt;this is very dependant on which size head studs you have.&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; I would be interested in learning more on this.
