Subject: RE: [VB] Anyone know of any serious rat look buses?

Hey Andy,

You could incorporate some empi bus steps onto the side bumper
supports... This is where they bolted up originally.  You may have to
reinforce them a little since I cant think if the bumper helps the
structural integrity of the step.

My brother has suggested putting cal-look t-bars on
the front instead of the bumper cos it doesn't have
the seam to ruin the line.
That'd mean coming up with a use for the bumper side
mounts as I'm not interested in cutting them off just
as a whim.
I'm thinking of mounting 55w wide beam driving lights
either side on them.
Wotcha reckon?
