&gt; Does anyone know what the bore size is on the single vs. dual MC's?  If the 
&gt; bore size is smaller (I doubt it) it may not be the &quot;upgrade&quot; it is touted 
&gt; to be.  

Hi Dan,
We wrote an article for the type2 library on this subject.  The 72 and later 
dual circuit MC has the same bore diameter as the 1955-67 MCs.  The only 
change is a longer bore for the front disc brakes which required more CCs of 
brake fluid, which does not affect braking power in drum brakes.
