Sound like a party to me, I'll be there with beer and? And an unsafe 62 DD 
panel ready to drive drunk through the streets of Jerome. We here in New 
Mexico are know for Low wages, high crime and the country's worst DWI rate. I 
think you'll see about 10 or so DWI New Mexicans at Jerome, So lock up your 
beer and daughters cause NM will be there.
I'm joking about DWI. I never drive drunk.
Jerome is one of the best events I've ever attended. I would rather go to 
Jerome then any other show in the country. You ABC dudes have the best shows 
and interest in Busses of anyplace.

&lt;&lt;  Everyone knows that us AZ bus folk are a bunch of drunken, unsafe, 
 idiots.  One need never have been to a Jerome Jamboree to know all about it 
 and all of the people who are in attendance.  And of course we never have 
 &quot;Tech Day&quot; at a local FLAPS where knowledgeble VW people help those in need 
 to fix/maintain their rides before a major caravan and event.   No, Jerome 
is 
 one event to miss for those who are safety consious.  I guess the safety 
 minded people only go to events other than BBB and Jerome.
