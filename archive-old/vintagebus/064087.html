Subject: Re: [VB] berg shifter installed

&gt; While they obviously perform well first up what sort
&gt; of longevity do they have?


I've had a Scat shifter in my '67 Westy for around 10yrs now. Only problem I
had was the adjustable ball that goes into the shift rod wouldn't stay put.
I removed the shifter and used a large amount of teflon tape on the threads
and re-installed the ball. It really works great, tightens up the shift
pattern well.
