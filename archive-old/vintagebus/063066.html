Subject: RE: [VB] re: tent (or other) storage

I cryogenicaly freeze mine, works great.......    actually it has been
stored in a green army foot locker for 28 years, in the garage wherever we
lived, from england to Georgia to CA, and used when needed, and always
cleaned after use, folded up, and stuffed back in the bag it came in. Never
had any problems with it so far and it's in very nice shape. It gets used at
least once a year so it gets checked and cleaned at that time.

Common sense when storing a tent...
ANYTHING that stresses the fabric is Not Good. So you
fold it so that no fabric is stretched needlessly. Nice
and loose. No rolling it into a fattie, then folding it
in half that stretches the outer part because it's
forced over all the other stuff. Nice gentle folds that
don't pull anything. Envision your own bag of skin
being folded for storage.
Dry is good. Put it away on a dry day. A big garbage
bag will preserve that day, otherwise a partially
opened bag of cheap charcoal briquets in an airtight
enclosure will absorb moisture and oders from nearly
anything and a lot cheaper than some volcanic ash BS
you can spend dumb money on. Check &amp; replace mid winter
nonetheless. A stack of dry newspaper will do the same
and can be changed often. They'll become as 'wet' as
the tent, so if you change it during the cold dry
winter, it'll dry it out. A big shot of carbon dioxide
will kill any bug and mold depending on oxygen. Find
your local home brewer, they use CO2 by the tankfull.
