Subject: Proposal for a new event: Midwinter Camping in the Driveway Weekend
Date: Fri, 9 Feb 2001 11:25:14 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

In the spirit of the highly successful &quot;Drive your VW to Work Day&quot; I'm
proposing an annual event for all of us bus owners. This activity will apply
mostly to my fellow midwesterners who are snowed or iced in for a
substantial portion of the year.
Here's what I'm thinking...
Last year, at the end of February, with several months of bleak winter
behind me and the prospect of more to come I finally snapped.
Putting on one of my favorite VW t-shirts and a pair of shorts I headed out
to my frozen Westy.
I put up the pop top, opened up the curtains, put some warm weather CD's on
the boom box and drank a couple of beers. I also smoked a nice cuban cigar I
had put away for awhile
Granted, it wasn't like spending the weekend in California or Arizona, but
it fit my budget, worked with my schedule and somewhat lifted my spirits.
How about a designated &quot;Midwinter Camping in the Driveway&quot; event. Anyone who
participates could snap a picture of their adventure (how about brats on the
grill with an iced over EZ camper in the background)?
Maybe Thom or Everett could find some space to host our pictures??
Sound like fun??
Just remember, only three more months until Spring!
John
