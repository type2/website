Subject: thermo switch?

I'm rigging an external oil cooler (incidently, this is unrelated to my
current engine's running hotness),
and would like a thermoswitch to turn on a fan.

Does anyone know where to get such a thermoswitch?  JC Whitney has one
that supposedly wraps
around a hose and turns on at 170 and off at 150.

I would prefer one that is either adjustable or goes on a little higher
and perhaps can sit in a pipe t-fitting, similar
to the pressure/temp sender for the guages.

Anyone know of such an animal?

Thanks,
...markus
