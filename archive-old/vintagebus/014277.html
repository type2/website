No, please do not post test messages.

If you *absolutely* feel you need to test, then send a message with the subject
&quot;help&quot; to vintagebus-request_at_type2_dot_com - you'll get the canned help message,
whcih proves you can hit the list server.  There is sufficient list traffic 
to determine, within an hour or so, that you are getting mail from the list.  
You don't need to generate more traffic just to test that.

Likewise, please don't post messages to the list asking if the list is down. 
(Think about it for a second...)

You can send messages to *me* (vintagebus-admin_at_type2_dot_com) with questions 
about the list.

Thanks.
