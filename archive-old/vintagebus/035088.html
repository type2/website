 think galvanizing should last a lot longer than powder coating(in terms of

Hi,
That would be the way to go!  Especially if he is sandblasting the parts 
himself.  As soon as one removes the paint off of all metals except for pure 
gold they begin to oxides.  So the longer steel has no protection to our 18% 
oxygen atmosphere the more the rust is going to under your new powdercoating. 
 Since to sucessfully zinc plate iron products means that the metal has to be 
perfectly clean.  The zinc shop first acid dips the parts to rid them of any 
oxides before zincing.  Even after zinc plating the metal it would not be a 
bad idea to have the parts zinc power primered before the semi-gloss black 
powder coating.  Eric&amp;Barb
