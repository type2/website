cause none of the signals work any more. &gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;here's the numbers: 111 953 225 anyone have one of these? my bus is a early
'66, originally 6V now 12V.&gt;&gt;
Hi Bob,
You need to buy the coverter kit for 1966 &amp; 1967 VWs.  House of Ghia in
Oregon has these kits for about $40.00-50.00 and from then on you just have
to use two of those standard three prong blinker box relays that you can get
&gt;from any FLAPS.  Eric&amp;Barb
