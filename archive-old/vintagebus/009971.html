This technique worked to my advantage (I was tied up at work this week and
unfortunately didnt get a chance to get back into it untl this evening.

Actually it was cake and I had the generator out in about 15 minutes.
Tomorrow AM I am off to  the FLAPS (they have a rebuilt in stock for $49;
sounds like a fair price). Should be back on the road by the end of the day
WOOHOO!!

Thanks again gang (I am beginning to sound like a broken record!!)



&gt; Sure.  You reach around and undo the bolt that holds the fan onto the
&gt; generator shaft.  Don't forget to be ready to catch the shims.  An
&gt; extra elbow helps in this procedure, as do long fingers....
