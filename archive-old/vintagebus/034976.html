 Looking for the answer on the axles.
 
 John K. &gt;&gt;


er -  VW used the same axle shafts them selves on all 3/55 through 67 buses.  
 the same tubes/RGBoxes were used 3/55 through 63.   this means the same axle 
parts were used on split case and on non split case trannies.     SO 
basically if you already have the rgboxes/axles, you didn't need to buy them, 
they are the same if you stay little nut.
 bug axle shafts are different.  also, bug axles tubes came in different 
lengths depending on year, meaning you need the right length tube for easy 
bolting into the bug, or so I am told, and have seen several differnt 
lengths, but this is bug, not bus.  perhaps that was what the people were 
thinking when they told you early and late bolt on different is all I can 
think of. 


Made nose cone mount adaptor plate for putting tunnel trans in split case 
bus.  never used the solid mount, but thanks for telling about its hassles.
