Subject: Transmission Noise
Mime-Version: 1.0


Remember a while back when I posted about a strange noise coming from the
transaxle?  It was a rattle at certain RPM's when I let off the throttle.

This weekend I replaced the transmission.  The noise is still there, 'cept
now it seems to do it when I accellerate, too.  The noise seems more muted
that it was before.  I replaced the front mount when I did the
transmission, so that may have something to do with it.

Any ideas?
