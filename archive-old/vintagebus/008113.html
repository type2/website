Hey
    On my recent trip to the Classic and Octo (6000 miles in 2 weeks) the
right front tire had some real outer wear.  I was carrying a ton of stuff
and with the added weight I would of thought that I would of had some heavy
wear on the inside of the tires.  I also had them fully inflated if not
extra for the weight.  Never noticed abnormal wear on the tire before the
trip but had to replace them as had metal starting to show.  Now would be
the time to get them aligned but in trying to think about this I don't get
how the outside of the tire could of worn so bad while there was good tread
in the middle.  Help me think of apples and oranges
