Subject: RE: [VB] How do you convert a 65' from 6volt to 12 volt ?

  Wofsburg West has NOS 12 volt nine pin relays, or you can get a KYMCO copy
for 45 dollars. 6 volt gas gauge will still work fine as long as the sender
is good. Have 6 volt gas gauges in all of my 12 volt converted buses. WW
again makes a replacement 12 volt armiture for the wiper motor or use a
voltage drop on the wiper

A 12 volt flasher will work. I used one from a baywindow.    Sean65
