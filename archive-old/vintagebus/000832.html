Had an emergency at home last Thursday and drove Sunshine (the '64 Westy)
way hard over the Santa Cruz mountains.  On my next  commute (yesterday), I
noticed she got real squirrely when I down-shifted so I checked and found
two bolts missing from the spring plate to reduction box bolt pattern.
Drove her home real carefully and today got the box disconnected from the
spring plate and everything else.

First thing was that the remaining two bolts were loose (no wonder she was
squirrely).  The front bolt (the one by itself) looks like it's been broken
a long time, the body of the bolt is now flush with the redux box and the
exposed part is rusty.  The upper, rear bolt (at the top of the three) has
broken off about three threads inside of the box and the hole looks a little
wallowed out like the bolt segment rocked front to back as it worked its way
out.

My appeal to the list wisdom is how would I go about repairing the oval
hole?  I hope I can get the partial bolts out of the two holes, but it is
obvious that some repair will be necessary to the upper, rear bolt hole.
Can this hole be drilled out and tapped for a larger hole, or is something
more drastic necessary?

Finally, I'll admit that I used old bolts when I put this tranny in two
years ago, but I can't do that again (none left ;-} ), so what is a good
source of these large bolts, qualified for this high stress application.  I
am afraid that the bolts down at Ace Hardware don't have the tensile
strength, but I recall that there is a way to tell by the markings on the
bolt head what kind of steel it is made of.  Any help on this?

Thanks in advance for any help, I really don't enjoy driving the F*rd
Must*ng 70 miles a day and want to get Sunshine running again as soon as
possible.

peace,
terry &amp; Sunshine ('64 Westy)
