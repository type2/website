Subject: RE: [VB] high pressure/Oil filter/cold issues

Clara,

Well...I don't have experience with 'Cold' issues (Yet!), cause' when I had
my engine built I was still in Florida.  I had my 1776 built by the top
mechanics in Ft. Lauderdale.  One of the things I asked for in this engine,
pertained to the oil pump.  I was all stoked to have a newly built engine,
so I wanted a spin-on filter on the pump.  I also wanted the brand Melling.

Engine was bought, I put it in the bus, and was grinning from ear to ear.
Two weeks later I was leaving work, heard a 'pop' or maybe was' a 'click',
and I lost all pressure.  Shut off the engine, and waited 3 hours for
AAA(that is another story altogether!).  I had it towed back to the shop
until the next day, to find the pump had failed.  'That is surprising, that
a Melling pump would fail', I said.  'Well...You asked for a filter pump, so
I put in a BugP*ck pump'.  I had them put in a non-filter MELLING pump, and
I have not had issues since.  It brought me here to the PNW.

I don't know who made your filter-pump, but I'll shy away from them.

IMHO, BugCrap should stay with accessories, and leave vital engine
componenets to others. - K
