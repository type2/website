So I go around blabbering to people about how I want to get a daily-driver,
and someone actually calls me......this guy has a '66 Sundial with bad
brakes, wobbly front end, and creative body contours...and the engine is
&quot;ok, I guess&quot;.  Must sell....moving, with new small human forthcoming....

What do I do?  I make plans to go see the thing...maybe I can get it for
$700...

Wish me luck.....I may want to pass on the savings to someone if they're
interested......

Gene
