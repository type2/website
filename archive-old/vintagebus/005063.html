Casey...

I got it from Home Base.  They had it outside providing cover for plants,
and I, having paint stuff on the brain, recognized it as a likely paint
booth....it cost $149 (plus tax).  SKU# is 087404703263  &quot;Shade Structure&quot;
10'x20'  (You can easily adjust the height by planting the legs on something
and bolting them down)

Good luck!

p.s.  If you have lots of money to spend on this type of thing, there is a
fully-enclosed unit (I don't know exactly where to get it, but I know
someone who sez he has seen them in a catalog)  The ends have big flaps with
zippers.  I think he said the cost was about $300

Gene

&gt; where did you get that awning? i have been looking for an awning for my
new
&gt; place and this is the best one i've seen. i need a tall one so my bus and
my
&gt; dormobile roof will fit under it. TIA
