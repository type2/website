Well I was going to suggest BFY, since I just got wiper shafts from them for my '67, but then I checked the catalog and they carry all years '55 and up...except '65. I wonder why....? What's so odd about the '65 wiper system?

&gt; 
&gt; Aloha all,
&gt; 
&gt; This is a true need--I've come out from lurking to ask if anyone has one
&gt; (OK two if there is that many, though only one is broken at this
&gt; point...) wiper shaft for my '65 bus?  It appears that only a '65 fits a
&gt; '65, and have not found it from Wolfburg West or West Coast Metric.  I
&gt; would truly appreciate the help!
