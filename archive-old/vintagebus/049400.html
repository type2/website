i use to buy quite a few parts rmmw and the service is excelent ,they have a 800 number and yes you pay for those things and the fast service with alittle higher prices,but they dont charge you 3 to 5 dollar handleing charge and they dont put you on hold for 10 to 15 to however long you can stand it ,so. cal is the worst on putting you on hold on your nickle i called kymco today and used a 3o minute phone card on hold twice so alot of times that sweet price is not assweet as you think, also charges your card wheather they back ordered the parts or if you got them .which im not to crazy about .so, cal does this .                               paul   sc																																				tx
