Subject: RE: [VB] Rear sway bar/camber compensator

 Hey Adrian do you have any pics of your Aircooled_dot_net sway bar installed?
I'm interested as to how it mounts to the springplates or A arms - its gonna
 cost loads to have that shipped to the UK so I hope to find something in a
 yard over here to suit.

 Also do you have your A arms mounted bug style or in the style that puts 
the
 A arm on the inside of the springplate.

 cheers
Paul
