Subject: Re.Fuel petcock

Was written++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
i really want to go drive around now and &quot;run out&quot; of
gas, just so i can operate the petcock in a &quot;real
life&quot; situation.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
I did the same think when I fixed the Petcock on my 59
Single Cab. When my 59 finally ran out of gas, it was
very sudden with No Warning at all. Luckily, I was on
a country road going 45mph so the speed kept the
engine going long enough to allow the reserve gas to
get to the engine. Sure was fun...
There is something so antique feeling about the fuel
reserve system.
