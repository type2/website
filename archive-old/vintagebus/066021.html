Subject: Eberspacher early BN4 switch/wiring question

I'm trying to get my BN4 going, which I recently bought on the Samba.  I'm
unsure of how to interpret the wiring diagram for the switch, which is in
the Eberspacher BN4 Manual, in the archives.  That link is below and it's
page # 32 when you get there..  What I don't understand is what the diagram
is telling me to do with 30A and 56H on the top right and lower right
respectively, as you look at the switch. The wire is supposed to be 1.5 gn
(green), but I don't understand how the wire is to come out and circle back?
To what?  I have not done this part yet.  The way I have it wired so far,
the components all come on except the one going from 30A (top left of
switch) to position #1 on the wiring block which is the blower motor.  The
blower works becauce it comes on when I hook it up directly to the battery.
Any help would be appreciated.

Question # 2 - my switch is an NOS eberspacher 6 volt, the heater itself is
12 volts (as is my system, with the wiring that I have done correctly so far
the switch seems to work fine.  Any issues with using a 6 volt switch with a
12 volt system?  I appreciate any help.  Thanks.
