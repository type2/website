Subject: Re: [VB] The talk about insanity...

The worth of something is the price that someone will pay for it.

VWs are relatively inexpensive.  A couple of years back I had to replace a
mirror housing and inside door handle on a F*rd T*urus.  The housing, a
hunk of plastic, cost way more than $200, unpainted.  The inside door
handle, in black plastic, not beige like the original, cost around $60.

Unless we're talking barndoors and split bugs, VW prices don't come
anywhere near &quot;modern&quot; cars.

I did the rear brakes on our Urban Assault Bug this weekend.  New drums
and shoes, less than a bill.  That's the economy you get when the parts
are used on a couple of decades worth of cars.

It's nice while it lasts.

George
