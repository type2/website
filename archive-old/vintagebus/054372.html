Subject: Re: [VB] Next Question

I have had the same problem with mine....... after cleaning that channel I
have spotted a few small holes. After a good cleaning I bought a small gas
welder &quot;set-up&quot; at Menards ($40.00) and used it to fill the &quot;bumps&quot; and
holes with copper - it's called brazing. In my opinion it is the cheapest
and yet probably the best for the money alternative to replacement of that
channel. You can also use this set-up for light welding of sheetmetal and
for cutting. 1 can of Oxygen will not last long but you can also use
Mapp-Gas and get more done. Practice makes perfect. I have used my MIG
welder a bit but nothing beats Gas welding.

Good luck,

&gt; &gt; I'm in the process of adding Safari Windows to my current '67 Camper
&gt; &gt; restoration.  I pulled my front windshields today, and was surprised to
&gt; &gt; see quite a bit of surface rust at the bottom of the channels where the
&gt; &gt; rubber holds the glass.  I put a wire brush into my drill motor and
&gt; &gt; cleaned it out the best that I could.  The surface on the bottom of
&gt; &gt; these channels is very rough and bumpy.  There are also a couple of
&gt; &gt; places that have rusted through, with the holes about as big as the end
&gt; &gt; of a pencil erasure.  My question is, should I have these channels
&gt; &gt; grinded down smooth, which will probably create some more small holes,
&gt; &gt; have the holes welded up and smoothed?  Or, can I simply apply body
&gt; &gt; filler over the entire area and sand it smooth.  I'd hate to have to cut
&gt; &gt; out the entire channels and have them replaced, especially since there
&gt; &gt; are only 3-4 small holes.  Does anyone know if the rust will keep on
&gt; &gt; deteriorating the metal, even if I primer and paint over it?  I don't
&gt; &gt; want to have to re-do this all in a couple of years, or even think about
&gt; &gt; it ever.
