Subject: RE: [VB] carb problem solved

I also bumped my main up to 140 and my air to 50 and brazed the hole in the
throttle plate closed. The noticable fuel mileage drop is very little, but
when my 67 SC is fully loaded, coming up a hill is whole lot easier. I drive
the same route all the time, and I know what it felt like before. The carb
mod was the best thing I could have done on my 1600 DP.

Subject: [VB] carb problem solved


I was recently asked why we changed the jet size on the 34-pict 3 carb my
bro 
has been &quot;dealing&quot; with (e.g. &quot;Just curious.  Why did you change the jet 
size?&quot;)

The reason for the jet size change came from a sugggestion. the guy who
built 
the dual port 1600 that is currently in my 68 bug (the one that I drove back

and forth from Visalia to Fresno ---50-ish miles one way , daily, for three 
straight years, without an f'n breakdown) said that I should. He owns a VW 
parts house in my town and has been in the business for thirty years. He
said 
that in order for an 009 distro to work with a bocar 34-pict 3 carb, a guy 
has to:
       1. set the timing at 30 degrees when it is fully advanced (high rev)

       2. make sure that the carb is &quot;tight&quot;
       
       3. change the main jet to a 135 to add fuel to compensate for the 
timing advance at idle.
       
Apparently, the issues concerning the flat spot come from the fact that he 
009's advance set-up demands more fuel from the carb. Changing the jet size 
on the main from stock (127.5) to 135 solves that problem.

by the way, the jet cost 2.50 , (yes two dollars and 50 cents) rather than 
the kajillions of dollars suggested by much of what I have read on the 'net
