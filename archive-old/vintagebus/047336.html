&lt;&lt; Dear volks,
 I had driving with '74 air cooled bus with standard engine 1.6 L .  Every
 week I drive around 400 KM with 80 Km/hr speed, problem comes out when speed
 more than 100 Km/hrs with more than 100 Km distance, engine oil will be
 leaking from behind of crankshaft pulley ( not a big leaking only dropping
 ), everyday I checked oil level, and I must re filled engine oil 0.5 Ltr
 after 1000 Km driving ( initial filling 2.8 Ltr ).  Did you have problem
 like me ?, please advise me.  Are there deflector, drive gear of distributor
 or pulley groove had problem ?.
  &gt;&gt;
if it is leaking around the crank pulley that much, you are probably getting 
oil all over your engine compartment, slime ick!   I had this same problem 
with the 1600 motor in my 61 bus, but not as much of a leak.    I think yours 
is leaking too much.   I would remove the crank pulley (remove rear cooling 
tin, remove 30mm bolt, pull off pulley.   sometimes the pulley can be a bit 
difficult to pull)  then inspect where the pulley fits into the case, is it 
perfectly smooth?  use very fine sandpaper like 1000 grit, to smooth any 
burrs or crud in there.   clean up- you dont want metal bits in the oil.   
check your pulley- it has grooves, is the matting area smooth?   Replace if 
you like, I would use as big a pulley as you can, for maximal cooling.    
Some people like the pulleys with tiiming marks, for ease of setting and 
knowing timing, but do NOT get the smaller &quot;power&quot; pulley- the idea behind 
that is saving power on turning the generator/fan, but it is better to have a 
bigger pulley and turn the fan more rather than less, especially as you are 
pushing a bay window around with your motor.  ANyway, they are available new 
if your old pulley is funky.   Install pulley, tighten bolt to spec , install 
rear tin and cooling tubes.  Does it leak now?  Hope this helps


Clara
