Hi Thom,
Wel we wanted it to be as easy as possible to remove and replace in case of 
repairs on the road.  With the old 1960-63 reductions we replaced a set of 
reduction bearings twice while on long trips.  The second time at a rest stop 
we did the whole job in just under two hours!  So when we went to the later 
reductions we drilled the center of the plugs, and filed a hex hole in them.  
Then simply welded a half thickness nut into the plug with a sheet metal 
cover welded on the inside of this nut.  Thus making it possible to just 
thread in a reduction box bolt, and using a claw hammer to extract the plug 
with one easy tug!  So far no leaks there for about 40,000+ miles, and three 
years in our panel camper, and the same time but alot less miles in our 
friends Sundial.
 
&lt;&gt;
Us either, except in cases like this where the two parts to be sealed 
together are heavy duty metal structures to be bolted solidly together.  With 
no movement or flexing the high temp silicon sealant does fine!   Eric&amp;Barb
