I have told the list of this product many times and I highly believe in it.
I have been useing it for over 15 years, you'll be amazed.
http://www.iepinc_dot_com/M250.htm. It's not a replacement of POR but is the
best rust remover/prep solution I have ever used. When I used to restore
Porsche's we would coat the whole body after stripped to bare metal with
this product.
&gt;note; I am not affiliated with this company, but have just used their
product with excellent results.

POR is great, but I hear there are alternatives that adhere well to bare
metal/paint also, I am interested in what brands they are, and if anyone has
experience with them. I plan on some minor floor repairs soon, and expect to
well prepare the flor before painting to prevent future rust.
