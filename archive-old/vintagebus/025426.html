Hey R
If you're into parts replacement, that's fine.  I'm of the fix what's needed
frame of mind with the exception of brakes.  At a minimum, flexible hoses,
shoes, wheel cylinders, front inner &amp; outer wheel bearings &amp; seals. Keep in
mind that '67 was a pivotal year with reports of both single and dual circuit
master cylinders.  A single circuit means if you lose a brake line you lose all
your brakes.  A dual circuit means you only lose half of your brakes.  Make
sure you flush the brake system real well with lots of new fluid from a new
sealed jug.  What's the nature of &quot;breaks need work&quot; anyhow?  Does it stop at
all?  Does it pull left or right?  If you give us more info we can probably
help you troubleshoot.  Your very best resources are the Idiot's guide by John
Muir and a Bentley guide for the 62 - 67 Transporter, with the list as a tie
with the above.
Dave
