&gt;I need advice.
&gt;My '66 bus stopped running about 8 months ago and I just can't 
&gt;get it to start.
&gt;
&gt;It turns over sort of irregularly:
&gt;grunt...grunt...[pause]...grunt,grunt [2-3 seconds]

Yours is doing *exactly* what my '64 was doing when I first bought
it.  I charged the battery and cleaned the connections at the
battery, and where the negative cable bolts to the rear sheet
metal.  No change.  Then, I replaced the ground strap with
a slightly longer cable, running from the battery negative
terminal to one of the generator stand bolts.  Went up and
hit the key and it was almost like I'd converted to 12v!
The starter spun a lot faster, fast enough for the engine
to start -- which means the ground strap between the transaxle
and body is probably quite crusty.

I wouldn't drive my Bus very far this way...I just wanted to
see if I could get it running.  The right thing to do is to
fix the ground strap - this will also help my generator and
ignition.  But it's a quick and easy test.  If you have
some jumper cables, you can do it without lifting a wrench.
Don't use the red clips at all.  Clip one of the black
clips onto the battery negative post, and clip the other
black clip onto the engine - someplace where it won't fall
off or get tangled in the belt.  Please don't clip to anywhere
on the carb or fuel line.  Go up and hit the key...I bet you
the starter runs like an antelope out of control.

If that doesn't get it, then the positive cable is probably
corroded.  Try flexing it with your fingers, especially the
end near the battery...does it bend nice and easy or is it
stiff and crunchy?  If stiff and crunchy, replacing it will
work wonders.  Don't forget to disconnect the negative cable
first before doing any positive cable replacement, and hook
up the negative again as the very last thing you do.

Good luck!
