 Thom;
 So when are you going to make a real road trip to So Cal or Az.? Something
like 1000/1500 miles at least round trip. Would love to see your blue 55
sometime, but will have to wait till I  come to Kelly park in April I guess
on my 1200 mile round trip, primer paint and all. No flames please, just
trying to get Thom and his great 55 westy out of his area so we can see it.

John Howard
