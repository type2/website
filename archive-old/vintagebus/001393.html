Subject: Dampner mounting Q
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Does the steering dampner attach to the tie rod clamp on the top of it or
the bottom of it? I have 2 different sources and one has a 58 and says its
on the bottom of the clamp and one has a 56 and says his on the top. I have
a 57...so which is it? or is this a year to year thing or does it really
matter?
Any help appreciated
-Wade
