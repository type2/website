Thanks for all of the responses on the ground question.  I ended up getting
a new battery because that one was shot.  The consensus was that I have a
short or draw somewhere causing the spark when connecting the jumper cables.
Therefore, I'm keeping the battery disconnected while parked to avoid
draining it nil I can track down the short.  I may get one of those cut-off
switches.
Thanks,
Mike
