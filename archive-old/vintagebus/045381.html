&lt;&lt; i need some help in identifying the purpose of the stamped numbers in my 
piano hinge window frames in my 1951 23 window bus. the number stamped is 
248. these frames were purchased seperate from the bus. does this number 
reference the body or chassis number from which the parts are from?  &gt;&gt;

im also curious on that subject. im restoring my 53 and found 241 stamped on 
my original driver door on the hinge and also on the frame top. my model is 
deluxe and if not mistaken is 241 model. i had to get replacement passenger 
door but has no sign  of stampings.???
