Barry,

The Canada crossing story was a forwarded message from Dana Gibeau on the
loaf list... it wasn't me.  Although your point is good about taking the
video camera... but I somehow suspect Dana is not going to get a resolution
to this, I think those crossing guards can do pretty much anything and get
away with it.  One wonders if they have rights like bounty hunters :)  Of
course, if it was your flip-seat Westy front seat they tore into!!  Perhaps
carrying some letter in your bus explaining that this is an &quot;antique VW,
seats costing $1000's of to replace&quot; that you handed to them before they
start their little search might hold some legal recourse later on?

No, VW isn't suing me... how did you reach that conclusion?  The &quot;most
incomplete site&quot; was a joke that people always have the &quot;most complete&quot;
site.  Mine is nothing more than a page that points to the type2 list :)  I
haven't decided what I am going to do with the site yet.

  Stephen

Stephen,
Are you going to be sued by VW? Maybe thats why the site is somewhat
penultimate.

Next Canada crossing, leave the typewriter and take the video camera.
