Subject: Re: [VB] Re: post mortem: intermittent alternator light

If I remember correctly, the threaded sleeve adapter from a spark plug 
will fit over the small starter post. Use it as a lock nut. They also 
fit the tail light screws if you need to affix a ground wire and make 
the tail lights a bit harder to steal.

Who's going to OCTO in two weeks, 2/6? It's also the same day as a 
highly regarded sports event that sells a lot of products to weak willed 
consumers.

&gt; Or, two nuts... or a metric nylon lock nut (check the local good
&gt; hardware store)... or drill it and safety wire it.  :)  The nyloc
&gt; has the advantage that you don't have to remember anything but
&gt; the nut itself.
