The VW air compressor kits are always advertised in Hot VW's mag, the people
who sell the kit have been running an ad for years.

Last year at one of the Puyallup WA VW shows/swaps a vendor was selling a
kit to convert a 1600 engine to an air compressor.  As I recall, it used 2
cylinders to do the compressor function and the other 2 to power the thing.

With a high-output alternator installed you'd pretty much have everything
covered.....

&gt;&gt;  Those are cool!  I wonder how much those cost; that would be perfect for
those remote parts runs.

How about a VW-powered generator/compress all-in-one - is that even
possible?  &lt;&lt;
