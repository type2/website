They're in Santa Ana, California, information (714 I think, possibly 310,
can't remember) anyway, They're listed
as &quot;RIDDLE MACHINE&quot; so ask for that when you call information.

They do good case work and head work, I've never had a carb done by them.
Mofoco (www.mofoco_dot_com) rebuilds your
Solex carb for you, and they do a good job.
