Subject: Re: [VB] RE: Oil opinions

Yours must be a LOT better quality than the one I messed with last summer.
The one I was fidling with was made by Stanley. Probably not the highest
quality as far as they go, but I thought it would have been a decent
contender.

Guess not?

----- Original Message ----- &gt; about the ir guns. I borrowed a decent one
from work &amp; am looking at
&gt; it right now. the spread on it is nothing like you remember eric. Mine
&gt; says 1.5&quot; at 12&quot; distance. So it is more accurate than you think,
