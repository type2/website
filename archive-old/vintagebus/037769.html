&gt; Here's a question...
&gt;
&gt; Were Riviera's the only campers to sport the long horizontal window running
&gt; down the length of the bus on the driver's side just aft of the driver's
&gt; door?
&gt; I'm asking because I just saw some pics of a sundial interior, and it looks
&gt; just like the interior on my 67' Riviera.  Unfortunately out here on the
&gt; East Coast, we don't have many Riviera's to compare with, so when the PO
&gt; told me it was a Riviera, I believed them face value.  Could I perhaps have
&gt; a Sundial?
If you have the long 3 section window on the driver's side, with 2 jalousies
and 1 solid window in the middle, look for a tag that says Travel Equipment
Corporation, of Elkhart, Indiana. Three single jalousies on the passenger side.
That's what mine is, and I have seen 3 others like that. There was also a tag
on the square pop-top before I updated the top as well. Look for the tag on the
overhead shelf in the very back. VERY cheesy interior and panelling. I had to
re-do mine. Someone might have put in a sundial interior, because the TEC
interiors that I've seen are pretty rickety.Usually a walkthrough, although
I've seen a bench seat that TEC converted.
