FWIW...  Many of the commercial electrical suppliers make a latching
relay.  I have used them in the past on industrial equipment.  If you
can't find a source for the 'correct' part, you might try your local
electrical wholesaler and see if Square-D, Allen-Bradley or
Cutler-Hammer makes one with a 6 or 12 volt coil.  If you can find
one, make sure to also pick up the correct eight pin socket. (looks
like a vacuum tube socket.) There's a few other manufacturers too, I
just can't remember their names off the top of my head.  Your
wholesaler ought to be able to come up with something though.

Heck, Radio Shack might even have 'em.  They're just not that rare.
