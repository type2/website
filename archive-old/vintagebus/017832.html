Subject: solo from monterey (a jerome post)

just in case anyone wondered, i did make it... dunno why as several things came up that should have prevented my progress.  i think that in about five years i'll look back on what i did and think that youth is crazy and fearless!  i drove the distance with a truck whose starter crapped out (well actually it was dragging real bad) somewhere between home and my first gas stop.  i almost had it fixed but pressed on like an escapee.  nine push starts later, a disabled break light, no e-brake, no signals, a mysterious wheel lockup that fixed itself and a 50 mph trek across the desert in the middle of the day i made it to rancho vanbondo in phoenix.  i'd been on the road solo, driving and sleeping, for 24 hours.  i had probably three of four hours of sleep total and was undoubtedly pretty weird.  jim, paula and even audry were great hosts and unafraid of the californian loony.  the ellis clan, joe clark from florida, joe bier from new jersey and myself made it to jerome friday with only three push starts.

jerome was great!  i camped with the route 66 splits as i have done in past years but this time i had my own type 2!  i drank so much that falling asleep at night wasn't a problem and enabled me to sleep through all the night strangeness that i was told about in the morning.  richard and dawn's wedding was really neat!  i liked the vows that they exchanged from the bed of a crewcab, the rings that look like bus fronts that they now sport and the two vials of oil combined into one to the engine of the truck.  also cool were the buses up on the ancient studebaker car carrier though my heart was racing to see them back off the rickety rig.  also responsible for some really scary moments was one of the vto twins (stan or steve) who climbed up on top of rustybus to take pictures from the elevated height of a bus on a car carrier.  his body was a swaying!

everyone survived and i think all the buses made it home... except mine which is &quot;vacationing&quot; in albuquerque.  tomorrow i go home to finish off the last six days of my old job, then i fly back a week before buses and balloons.  i want to help the club get stuff together and fix my truck enough so that the drive back to california and my new job is a bit easier.  who knows, maybe jp will have fixed my truck all up so that all i'll have to do is camp in it!  &lt;grin&gt;
 
ps.  don't let anyone push start you with a vehicle if you have a bumper you like.  defend even your nasty bumper from the ravaging of a vehicular push start.  sheesh, what is it about being a &quot;little miss&quot; that makes some men think they know better?

in a Volkswagen you ARE somewhere. -Stormy Henderson's Dad
