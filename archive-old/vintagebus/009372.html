Subject: Stainless Steel Exhaust pipe?
Date: Wed, 28 Mar 2001 18:42:39 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I was walking inside the lumber yard today brainstorming about VW engines
and so forth and as I walked by the hand rails for the handicapped, I
noticed they looked like they were made from spun stainless steel.  They're
hollow and have a 3 bolt flange that attaches to the wall.  It even looked
like it was larger tubing for use in performance VW engines.  So I'm curious
if anyone has used this stuff (a bit pricy) to hackup and make an exhaust
out?  At the very least it looks like it would make a good set of pipes
(with some modification) for a dune buggy.  Anyway, I'm going to file that
away for future reference should I need any custom exhaust tubing stock.
