Subject: RE: [VB] steering &amp; suspension

That's why I love this group!
To answer your questions, no, my trailing arms, which I somehow mistakenly
call swing arms, do not seem to bent in any way. The rubber on the bottom of
the stops is where it is worn off, I can't possbly guess how the rubber on
the top of the stops could ever get worn off in a lowered condition unless
your suspension drops down repeatedly instead of being forced up. And yes, I
checked my manual pictures agaisnt my front end and it looks stock. I have
seen pictures in Hot VW of the lowering adjusters and I don't have that
stuff welded on my torsion bar tubes. Ands as far as the snap, crackle and
pop goes, quit cheering me up ! I think I hear that kind of thing going on
on my passenger side. For the last month or so I have heard odd thunking
noise from that side and now have attributed it to your e-mail descriptions,
thanks for making me feel safer !

&gt; The second item is front suspension. I know my torsion bars are either

Hi Ray,
Is that the top side of the rubber stops you mean?  Congrats on getting the 
steering to work!

 each and &gt; every little bump bangs my front end. The swing arms look to be 
&gt; stock, but how can one tell?

If the trailing arms are that badly bent you would be able to tell from 
looking at the Bus shop manual photos.

 everything down there seems to be equally greasy, but &gt; since I bought this

&gt; truck in a lowered condition and was able to properly raise the rear, I am

&gt; perplexed as to what to do with the front. Right now I am running 750lb 
&gt; coil over shocks that I put on yesterday that raises it back to stock 
&gt; height, but it also rides like a, well, truck. What to do with my daily 
&gt; driver to see what's wrong with the suspension?
&gt; 

Does your front end have the lowering adjusting parts welded in the center
of 
the front beam?  If so you need to jack up your bus and install jack stands.

Then adjust the front suspension so the wheels end up as far down as 
possible.  
  If the DPO removed some of the spring leaves the remaining leaves could be

snap, crackle, popping and ready to let the trailing arms to pop out of the 
front end while you are driving!  If sprong leaves are missing then you need

to remove them and install new ones.   Eric&amp;Barb
