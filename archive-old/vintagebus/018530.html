I'm with George on this one. Why not ditch all the
Type 3's and go with all buses, bugs, things, and Type
1 Ghias? 

If pre-12-volt is where it's at, why do so many people
convert their 6-volt cars?

&gt; we could include 67 buses, 
&gt; but reject 67 beetles; only cars with early style
&gt; headlight buckets.

&gt; &lt;&lt; Y'know, that seems to be a very arbitrary
&gt; division.  Why a '67 bus and not
&gt;  a '68?  Both vehicle share most of the same design
&gt; details and differ
&gt;  only in the cosmetics of the body and a few running
&gt; gear improvements
&gt;  (which '67-down folks seem to love to incorporate
&gt; into their buses)  The
&gt;  line is even thinner between '67 and '68 bugs.
