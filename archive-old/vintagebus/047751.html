 &lt;&lt; I had problems getting it into reverse at first and the seller told me 
 that it needed a shift bushing &quot;same as in my beetle but easier to get at&quot;.  
 Now I lost 4th gear.
  :-(  So I am going to change the bushing and hope it is not the trans. &gt;&gt;
 Hi Paul,
 The 1959 and earlier front shift linkage do not use a plastic bushing.  
 Instead that area is all metal to do the same function.  The rear shift tube 
 in non-barndoor has two plastic bushings.  What probably is wrong is either 
 the rear flex shift coupler is spliting and/or the coupler bolts just 
forward 
 of the tranny and/or where the front and rear shift rods meet in the forward 
 coupler are loosening.  You need to slide under there NOW, take a look to 
 figure out if you need to replace the rear flex shift coupler or at the 
least 
 tighten either or both of the coupler bolts, and safety wire each so the 
wire 
 tightens each bolt.  Otherwise expect to have no shifting all of the sudden 
 in traffic.  BTDT  
 Get the Bentley reprint of the VW bus shop manual for 1963-67 soonest!

wow, I was going to write just about what veewee did.  I just changed a shift 
coupler on a friends 65, unfortunately accidentally used a brasilian 
replacement, those things are real junk- it was cracked and painted over the 
crack !!! and the ID is about 25 thousands &quot; too big, sloppy sloppy, tossed 
that, the good german one is so much better.  That made the shifting much 
tighter pattern up front.

for a splitcase tranny bus you really want to use the sandwich type of rear 
shift coupler, or the metal will transmit the engine and tranny noise up 
front.   Using the later kind is better tahn nothing if your old one is 
trashed, but be on the lookout for the sandwich kind.  Do get the Bentley 
book and a copy of the Idiot book too if you are not real familiar with 
mechanics manuals as the idiot book is much easier to read, but the bentley 
has much more info and pictures and much more complete than the idiot book 
esp on body stuff.  Most of the stuff in the benteley still works on your 55, 
unless you can find an original 55 edition of the transporter Workshop manual 
this is the best book.

============

Also, how rare is a 55 pickup and what is the range of prices, before and
after restoration?  Even in its current state it still turns heads here in
Chicago.
......................
fairly rare, neat truck, everyone think VW bustrucks are cool.   prices- 
really depends on how straight, rusty, hacked, complete, shiny it is.  Things 
like bumpers and taillights and reflectors can cost much dinero.  Drive it, 
fix it, paint you company logo on it.
