How much are they paying you to take their trailer to where they 
need it?  Hopefully you're getting a sweet deal or need to drive 
from Texas to Pennsylvania for some other reason.  That's 
a heck of a lot of gas just to get a trailer from the bottom 
of the country to the top...maybe you could at least pick 
up a rider for that trip to Steel City!

Glad to see you found a trailer.  That would have sucked...

the guy from budget just called - he found me a trailer.
so now i am going to be driving a 24' truck maxed out on weight 
(16000 lbs!)  and towing a 14' trailer. and they want me to take the 
trailer to pittsburgh when i am done with it in texas.

sigh.


moving is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo   much fun.
