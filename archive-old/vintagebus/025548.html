One thing he mentioned as a difference
&gt; was &quot;king and link pin front axle with vacume disk brakes&quot;... now this
&gt; caught my attention!

This is definitely not true.

I have crawled all over and under these Busses (and took many detail
pictures)and they have the normal Bay Window suspension under them.
In Brasil they switched to that suspension in approx. 1975.

Parts from before are interchangable with the 64-67 German Bus, but are
quite expensive. Still avilable at VW Brasil though.

Believe me folks, I had to hang around at a VW dealership in Mexico
recently and had nothing to do but inspect Busses and Bugs.
