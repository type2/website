...the second digit is the model of bus.  My '69 camper was also a Tye23
(-517 to be specific)

The 3..eh. i forget exactly.  The commercial/kombi version if i recall,
but i'm not trying hard.


&gt; 2.&gt; Bench model! 1/3-2/3 seat

Full width middle?  Sounds like a nine passenger...but it could have the 2
person middle and be an eight.  There are a few of them on the type2 list.

&gt; 3.&gt; No interior push-pull door lock knobs on front
&gt; doors. (no hole or mechanisms per factory)

You're saying it doesnt have the up/down style lock pulls?  Did it have
the &quot;tabs&quot; at the handle like the earlier models? Or are you saying it had
none at all?


&gt; 4.&gt; No interior slider lock handle/switch.

Huh.  I think the panels were this way, much like the split
panels...this would back up the &quot;commercial&quot; aspect.


&gt; 8.&gt; US spec turn signal/stop lights frnt/rr.

no surprise here..?

&gt; 9.&gt; MANUAL choke knob in front seat stand ala 1950's
&gt; splitty. Heater knob on dash as all bays.

NOT the aisle floor vent control for the heater? (between and just rear of
the front seats, in the walktrough isle)

&gt; 10.&gt; Vynil headliner over driver/psgr area only.

Still sounds commercial.

If it had rear seats, they were probably added..it sounds like it may well
have been a panel-with-windows.
