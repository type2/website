Subject: Clutch troubles

Hello oh wisened listees:

I am having an annoying problem with my clutch.  I just replaced
everything about 2 months ago, well not everything, my 9 spring pressure
plate is the same one.  When I installed the new cable, I noticed that
the wing nut is almost at the bottom of the threaded portion of the
cable.  Everything seemed to work fine, but as the cable is stretching
my clutch is getting looser and I'm having trouble getting into 1st
gear.  There is also noise coming from back there when the clutch is
released, ie pedal to the floor.
    The only thing I can think of is A) I installed the throw out
bearing incorrectly, I've replaced this stuff before in other vehicles
and never gotten it wrong before.  B) I noticed that my Bowden tube
doesn't bow anymore. C) The cable I got from my FLAPS is the wrong one.
I drive a 65 standard with a 1600 dp and original transaxle ground out
for 12v flywheel.
    Anyone out there with an answer?
Thanks,
Jon
