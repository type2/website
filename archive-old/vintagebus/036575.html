They have the sigla logo on them.  I'm in no rush to get them in and don't
want to break more so I'll probably wait until spring.

&gt;  Thanksgiving weekend I tried putting a corner window in and broke it. 
&gt;  thanks to Neil Pickett for getting me another window.  (I got it today,
your
&gt;  check is on the way)  Not sure what to do about the windows, I don't want
to
&gt;  break any more.  Anyone have any tips for the corner windows, those are
the
&gt;  only kind I've never installed.
&gt;  - -  - -- 
&gt;  I never did the corner windows either,   are yours wth laminated glass or

&gt;  sekurit?    Let us know how it goes-  , use lots of lube I guess, and
warm 
&gt;  the rubber up first so it is more supple.(in the sun?  ha ha)
