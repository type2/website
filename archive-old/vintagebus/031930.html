I have:

'65 Deluxe, 21 window, SWR/BG, original paint (getting a little thin in some
places), very little rust, came with the No Interior and Cut Wheelwell options.
It has about 350,000 miles on it. I bought it in 1980 with 135,000 miles. I'm
starting to think I might keep it a while.

'65 Crewcab, White, Crusty rusty, my trusty daily driver. I've put over 100,000
miles on it since 1993.

Still in my driveway, but sold:

'65 Kombi, Dove blue, rough but still a good driver.
