My 53 standard has these pop outs, and also I saw them on a early 54 in a 
junkyard.probably somewhere else (?)  Sorry I don't have a scanner or 
digitalcamera, being technologically challenged, or I woul take a pic.  
According the the 58 ed parts list they were used through CH # 20-76 673 and 
are called
p/n 221 847 105
ch 20-76 674 &amp; later use the 221 847 105A version

63 edition book lists 
p/n 265 847 105 for the frame sold for the earlier ones,  implying there is 
enough difference between the early version and the truck version for a 
differnt p/n , but the truck version was sold as supercession for the early 
bd version.  hm...

&lt;&lt; I *think* 52 and earlier used this style of popouts.
 Although they would have been different as the barndoor ones would have been 
 the &quot;Wolfsburg&quot; style ones with the four pins on the inner channel holding 
 the screw tabs together.

 Someone has another set of DC windows - which I've never seen on a barndoor.
 What's especially amusing is the &quot;No Reserve!&quot; in the description, but
 there *is* a reserve on the auction.  Hmmmm....
