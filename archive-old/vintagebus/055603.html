Subject: Re: [VB] SHIMS OUT!!! Some advice neede.

Hi Craig,
Of course it is your engine and bus.  We would just rebuild it and not have 
any worries out on the road.  Plus if you install a CW crank and full flow 
filter/oil pump it will have a few more HP, smoother quieter engine, and the 
cam/main/rod bearings will last alot longer than stock.   Eric&amp;Barb
