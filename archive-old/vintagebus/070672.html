Subject: Re: [VB] NOS Barndoor wiper blades found.........

The solution to your problem is simple. Add a 10 to 20% markup on your cost
and offer them for sale. Or, is it your strategy to see how much you can get
for them while appearing to be reasonable?

I found about 50 sets NOS Barndoor wiper blade this weekend. They have the
arms, but no bases.
They are original SWF and still have soft and workable rubber on them.

My question, since I'm not a BARNDOOR guy is, what can these be SOLD for
that is reasonable to both parties?
The reason I say SOLD, is I know I could price them at $XXXX.XX and sit on
them forever, but that's not my style.
