Subject: Sandy Eggoers' Help! (Caution-scant bus content!)
Message-ID: &lt;19990714154244.25998.qmail_at_nwcst292_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

My Humble appologies for the scant Bus-related contents of this e-mail (I'll
never do it again!).  I'm heading to Sandy Eggo to attend a Coastal Conference
and prior to this will be heading down to Baja for some surfing (for four
daze).  We plan to travel about an hour south of Ensenada and I'm having
difficulty finding a car rental that will rent a 4WD beyond Ensenada.  Anyone
&gt;from the area have any suggestions where I might be able to rent a 4WD to haul
4 surfboards and two friends?

On the bus note, I wuz inadvertently nuked from the list (At least I think is
was inadvertent) and since have returned.  two weeks ago, I woke up in my bus
to find my battery completely dead.  I was next to a state park that had a
boat floating next to a dock.  Since it was very early in the morning and no
one around to give me a jump, and I needed to be north to pick up my daughter,
I borrowed the battery out of the boat, started my bus and returned the
battery back to the boat and put my other dead battery back in.  There was a
relatively strong short occuring (I noticed when I hooked up the boat battery
there was an immediate healthly load-it sparked- with everything off.)  My
charging system was working and like i said, I need to be on the road.  About
two miles from my home, the bus died-the battery was drained and the charging
system had failed-either the generator of the voltage regulator... So now I've
got to discern the nature of the short and get foo-neck-betty back on the
road!

later,

-christian
