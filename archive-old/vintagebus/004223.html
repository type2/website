Subject: Friday is Take your dog to work Day

Friday is the huge
take your dog to work day holiday
. Hallmark and the rest are making a killing on cards. How come no take your
VW to work day cards? Looks like Suzie goes to the #hit plant weather she
wants to or not for a nice day trying to out run the coyotes on the island.
She's getting kind of overweight anyway ( like her owner) so should do her
some good as long as she is fast. We will meet for lunch at Burger King.
Suzie a Big King, me a mini diet PEPSI. By the way Suzie is a long
hair/short hair doxie, black and tan. She was at the 1st Jerome Jam with her
3 puppies and all found great homes., have a blowup pic for the Jerome X
auction, plus alot of other COOL PICTURES of the 1st JEROME. You all better
be there or I will sic the man on you ( Kyle, with Joe as backup  ). Little
early for the crazy Friday stuff, but will be asleep in 15 mins so thought I
would run it through now. Also going to a streetrod/motor cycle show in
Laughlin this Sat, see what they all think of a VW Bus in the show. Mark M.
is cool and so are all his Barndoors. All for now

John ( What ever ) Howard, but still having fun.
