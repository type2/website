Being into alternative vehicles like our beloved busses, I'm also
attracted for better or worse to alternative computers.  I recently
ordered the sermons from the BD but forgot to ask if they were
compatible with my computer.  Erin's post reminded me I forgot to ask if
the sermons can be seen on a Mac.  

Has anyone used the Sermons on a Power Mac.  I've got Adobe Acrobat,
will that be enough to view them??

Thanks.


Steve
