Hi Bart,
It depends!  Could be only one or all three of them.  Take each of your keys 
and turn them like you were going to stab yourself in the eye with them and 
take a look at the grooves cut in the length of the key.  If they look the 
same you probably can have an old timer key shop in your area or someone like 
Gabriel who specializes in Vw locks change the pins in your lock so they 
match.  Also take a look at the key number if your have this stamped on them 
near the handle.  If stamped the letter before the number indicates the key 
profile.  Remember that a key cut to the lock code is alot better working 
than one ground by using a old worn key!  It would help to know your year of 
bus so we could tell you the key profile you should have!   Eric&amp;Barb
