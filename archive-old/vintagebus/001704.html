Subject: My Formal Apology To The List
Date: Sun, 16 Aug 1998 13:51:16 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello all.  I am writing to offer an apology to all who feel that I
had something to do with Bob Hoover taking his sermons off the web.
I'm not sure how so much of this got dumped on me, as I never called
him a profane name, discredited his knowledge or otherwise &quot;flamed&quot;
him.  It all started with an innocent reply to SOMEONE ELSE'S post
about copyright and then an offer of agreement as to similar treatment
that I had received from him while offering him my praise of his
knowledge.  I guess because I have been the one to reply to others'
posts and share my agreement so that they would not feel alone in the
bashing, I'm the one to pay the price for Bob's leaving.  Anyway, I am
truly sorry to those of you who feel I am directly responsible as I
would have never chosen to piss off an entire list of bus freaks,
because I would someday hope to be one of you experts.  Also, I do
thank ALL of the kind souls who answered my request for info about
properly supporting a bus, as we did find that it was not as easy as
one might expect, and the Idiot's manual didn't exactly give the
answers that many of you did.  Again, if I wasted your time with such
a silly question, again I apologize.  Some of you will I'm sure write
to say I'm again &quot;snivelling&quot;, then my point is lost on you and will
be forever.  Those who do understand my point would be the ones who
would understand ME, and I do hope we get the chance to meet someday.
For the rest of the list, I guess I'll have to use a fake name now!
:-)
Sorry for the lengthyness of this; however, I do feel it's important
to  say all of this to all of you, because I feel terrible about this
whole Hoover thread and would like to again be able to read and join
in on list discussions without being the black sheep.  If even one of
you still would EVER like to know me at this point, I have
accomplished what I set out to do here.  Thank you for your time.

Michele
Still Samba'ing???
