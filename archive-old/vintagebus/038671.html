&gt; Well, at a current price of roughly $600 per ounce for platinum, of
&gt; course they're going to be expensive.  Maybe you should consider going
&gt; with something a bit cheaper, like gold ($264/oz) or silver
&gt; ($4.70/oz).  Or if you *do* decide for that 100-point resto, go for
&gt; rhodium ($1700).  I have trouble believing that sitting on metal mesh
&gt; of any type is going to be all that comfortable during either
&gt; temperature extreme, though.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, you were talking about colour, not material.  Never mind.

Good point!

Based on durability, availability, comfort,color match, and cost to weight
ration I have selected duct tape to recover my front seats:)
