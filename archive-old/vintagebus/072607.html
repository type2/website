Subject: Re: [VB] AH Case w/ Dual 34 ICT 009 Timing?

Also make sure you do not retard the timing too far. I built an engine
once that turned the exhaust pipes bright orange with a total advance of
28 degrees. LOL
-------------------- Clip ---------------------
Isn't a too lean or too far advance going to show up on the spark plugs?.
I get near white on too lean and a nice coffee with cream color when
everything is tuned in pretty good.
Appears that the plugs would be self destructing at the same time the
exhaust was reaching bright orange /cherry red.
