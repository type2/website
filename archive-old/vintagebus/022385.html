Mark-

Looks like some really nice work!!  For those of us just tuning in, who did
the work?  And what did it cost?

Thanks,

&gt;Well I got the new bed. It's just sitting on the truck and I put the 
&gt;piece of the old bed on it so you can compare. 
&gt;http://www.centralia.wednet_dot_edu/lytle/mark2.html click on the '59 VW 
&gt;Singlecab Truck Link. Take a look and see what you think. I had mine 
&gt;made in two pieces front to back. I'm sure he can make them in four 
&gt;but there would be a lot more shrinking to do to form the ends. He 
&gt;had some problems handling the nine foot sheets of material and it 
&gt;took two days to make so the cost was alot higher than expected but I 
&gt;was glad to pay it to have a new bed! He left me excess material all 
&gt;the way around to wrap around the flange and trim to fit against the 
&gt;front. He also said the best way to attach it is to drill holes where 
&gt;the runners are below and weld the holes with my mig welder.
