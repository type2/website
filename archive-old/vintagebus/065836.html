&gt; As are the bars in a 911 - I wonder when it was that VW decided
&gt; it *did* matter...

Probably when one failed - then the investigation into why it failed found
the reason to be due to R&amp;R during service for some reason.
Would probably be around the mid 60s due to it only being in the bay window
Bentley manuals - by that time the splitscreen manuals had all be written.
