Hello to the list.  I am new to the list and, to a certain extent, VW's.
I have enjoyed reading the archives and have found loads of good advice
within them.

My questions:

I have a 66 Westy with 1600DP.  When the motor is well warmed up (pushing
into a strong headwind for 40+ miles at 55-60mph in warm weather) I can
hear a rotational whirring sound when clutch is depressed.  My first
thought was T/O brg, but I replaced clutch, T/O, pilot brg about
4,000miles ago. Any ideas?

Other question:  I changed the oil in trans a while back and was perplexed
to find only one drain-plug-- not two as my manuals indicated
(Bentley,etc.)  What type of trans is this?  The bus has redux boxes.  I
glanced under a 69 bug and noticed the same trans, but it was an IRS.  I
am just a little curious.

Thanks for any advice,

Don Thompson
