Wow!  I just came in to post about my latest fiasco with adjusting the
clutch on the bus and Jon, know exactly what you mean about the heaterboxes
in the way!

First off, I didn't have the luxury of having a wingnut.  I have a 14mm nut.
Talk about fun.  I was outside last night with frozen feet, sniffles, and a
major headache when I had to threw in the towel.  I decided I'd just have to
buy a 14mm spanner, cut it in half, and use the shortened spanner to tighten
the nut.  It worked well albeit slowly.  I was able to sit at about a 45
degree angle to the bus while on the creeper.  I sat, from the front of the
left rear tire area, with my feet hanging out the right rear.  Then I took
my left arm, reached alongside the tranny and over the swingaxle boot and up
to the end of the cable.  Sometimes I'd reach over the top of the left
heater box and grab the little wrench on the nut but my right arm tired
quicker than my left because of the weird angle.

To top it all off, I tightened the nut all the way up and had 1 1/2&quot; of
freeplay left in the clutch.  Bad deal.  So I painstakingly removed the nut
after noticing that there was no bend in the bowden tube!!!  Someone had
shimmed it previously but it wasn't enough.  I went to the washer can,
picked me out a good looking washer (hey baby!), put it in the vise and
ground a slot in it.  Then I pulled on the bowden tube, stuck the washer in
there, pushed up on the tube, and started tightening the nut again.  This
time I got the nut down to about 3/4 of the length of the threaded part of
the clutch cable before my clutch was in adjustment.

The funny part is that since I took 1/2 day vacation to &quot;recuperate&quot;, I'm
able to have my father help me.  Now that's not big deal in itself until you
factor in the part of him being deaf.  I can't simply yell at him to stop,
go, or any other go-fer command because he just won't hear.  So I told him
about the clutch freeplay and slid under the bus.  I started tightening up
the nut and every so often, he would push the clutch to check freeplay and
as I got nearer and nearer to 1/2&quot;, he was really working that pedal.  Mind
you, I'm trying to tighen the nut the whole time.  So picture this - 60's
male leaning in door on 67 bus, working clutch feverishly with hand.  Big
overall wearing man in his late 20's, laying on creeper, left hand trying to
tighten clutch cable nut, right hand sticking out behind tire - flapping arm
around trying to garner 60s man's attention (in the remote chance that he
looks.)  We finally got everything adjusted perfectly but what a sight that
must have been. :-)

Next I'm setting out to hook up the fuel line, make a vent line setup(the 71
bay window tank has a vent on the top and I don't know what to do with the
line I've got hooked to it.  You can't plug the vent off - it ain't that
simple.), and put in the rear apron, hook up the wiring, and see if I can
actually get this old splitty to move itself.  If it does, it will mark the
FIRST time in my life that I've ever actually driven a split window bus.
