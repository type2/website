&gt; Ummmm.... Why?

I've always wondered myself - the gearing is not compatible with
any except the most modified engines.  I think it's bragging rights.
The mere invocation of &quot;it has a Porsche transmission&quot; evokes
oohs and ahhs.

&gt; sitting around for a good rebuilt 915 tranny?  They only last 50-80K miles
&gt; when treated nicely, first gear syncho dies.

They'll eat first *and* second synchros, and it's common to have to replace
the synchros, slider rings, brake bands, etc at the time of each rebuild.
If you've been gentle, you can get away with &quot;flipping&quot; upper gear sliders the
first time.  A proper 911 (ie 915) transmission rebuild will run you
$1000 easy, and if it was that little, I'd suspect corners were cut.  
$2000 is a better budgetary figure.   I spent $2500 getting mine rebuilt,
along with a new clutch and a couple of minor &quot;while we have it apart&quot;
items, like a shift coupler.

I've hears that 901s are getting hard to find parts for.

Also, the clutch setup is very different except in the early cars, where
it's only mildly different.  72 915's are a one-year-only setup (ask me
how I found that out :( ) and '76 and '77 also have some narrow-year-band
funkyness (like a $100 helper spring).

In all honestly, the 901/915 trannies suck.  They're way too fragile for
the application, but people just accept it.  The serious porsche people
upgrade to the G50 anyway.  My bus tranny shifts much nicer than my
911 tranny, and it's just an off-the-shelf production rebuild.

You might consider the bus 091 tranny, but like Ronnie said, you have to
do a whole buncha work to get everything set up correctly.  Any of the
swaps are going to take a whole bunch of work.  It *has* been done, but
you have to evaluate your objectives as well as your financial and 
elbow-grease committment.  

In summation, what is the objective?  All too often people immediately
delve into exacting technological details, without first defining
what they're trying to accomplish.  They try to define the 
problem in terms of the techology they've deemed appropriate beforehand, 
ie &quot;how do I put a ____ in my bus&quot; rather than determine what technology is 
appropriate for the problem, ie &quot;I want a bus that is ______er&quot;

So what do you want:

* A more durable transmission?  The 915/901 probably isn't it.  
* A 5th gear/higher speeds?  Use the Berg setup or a freeway flier.  
* Bragging rights?  Break out the wallet and the welder...
