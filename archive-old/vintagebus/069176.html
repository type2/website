Subject: Re; Safari Windows

 Just got a set of Wolfgang SS fronts and rear through Ronnie and they are OK.
Have the Volvo style weatherstrips that Harry was talking about. Fit is OK,
they don't seem to be shaped as good as some and the outside welds really show
and look bad with the polished ss, would be OK if painted as you could bondo
the spot weld low spots before you painted to match your color. They came
complete with all hardware and good instructions. Fronts have og style
latches. Have installed many sets before so install was easy by myself and
took about 1 hour total for both front and rear. Nothing is as good as og
though. Overall I'm very happy as my bus is custom and not og.
