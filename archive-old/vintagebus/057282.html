Paul

&gt; i have a split bench seat for him ive been holding
&gt; for over two years... he 
&gt; sent me money for it a LONG time ago. he's told me
&gt; at least a dozen times 
&gt; he'd come to get it. his email is no longer valid. i
&gt; cant get a hold of him. 
&gt; im tired of holding it and want to sell it.
