Subject: Re: [VB] Got my birth certs! time to start cutting in
 thewalkthru

Way back when they didn't charge for this I wrote to them twice witht he =
same VIN (don't ask) and got two different responses regarding the date of =
production of the van. They only differed bya  day but would seem to imply =
that the factory's records aren't flawless esp. when they contradict what =
was stamped on the m-code tag etc.

I doubt that VW expected that 40 years later vw fiends would be asking =
them to blow the dust off their old record books and dig up this info.

&gt;I emailed my Credit card information to the VW museum exactly 3 weeks ago
&gt;and today my 2 birth certificates arrived. They charged my card $30.90. =
the
&gt;extra 90=A2 was charged due to my request of &quot;an Mcode list and any =
addtional
&gt;information you could provide on my buses, I would be happy to pay for&quot;.  =
I
&gt;got a copy of their mcode list and also a listing of paint code
&gt;numbers,names and what upholstery was supposed to match it ( Commercial
&gt;stuff only, 1950-1964) Interesting to note that nowhere do they refer to
&gt;'dove blue' or duvblau, they only call it 'Taubenblau' (the whole list is
&gt;all in german btw). yet on my birth certificate they call it dove blue.
&gt;
&gt;everything seems to be in order on my barndoor certificate except that it
&gt;says my panel has Mcode 083 which they say is &quot;walkthrough cab&quot;.. but my
&gt;bus is not a walkthru.
&gt;Looking at their Mcode list, they have 4 walkthru mcodes, 80,81,82,83.
&gt;80 is called out as being specific for a panel bus, walkthru.
&gt;My only guess is this list isnt early model specific and 83 meant =
something
&gt;else back in the day?
&gt;
&gt;My bus also had snow tyres, Laminated front glass, and 018 and 086 not
&gt;identified.
&gt;heres a scan of the cert

&gt;
&gt;My 57 SC cert has nothing special on it, Mcode 360 unidentified, USA
&gt;delivery
