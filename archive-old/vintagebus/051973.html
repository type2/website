Subject: Re: [VB] Rear Shift Coupler Screw

i have been corrected, because i can't figure out what all those little
lines mean on a measuring tape.
it's 5/16&quot;, and not 5/8. geez, metric sure is easier.........


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; 5/8&quot; for those who use standard tools on their metric vehicles, 8mm for
the
&gt; others. i've used both and they both seem to wotk just fine.

&gt; &gt; There was a post fairly recently stating that you could get the correct
&gt; size 
&gt; &gt; square socket at sear although I don't recall the size.
