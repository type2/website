Youre mistaking body number with VIN number.
Im my 56 the number on the bulkhead does NOT correspond with the actual VIN 
number stamped on the plate in the engine compartment.
Hope that makes sense.

I am thoroughly confused about the year of my bus!  I had sent a message
to the list ealier saying that the VIN of my bus was 282407, but after I
looked at the actual title I noticed that it said 200632.  So I decided to
investigate.

I went out to the bus and lifted the front seat and looked behind the
passenger side to see the number 282407 stamped into the metal.  Next I
went back to the engine compartment and looked at the front of the
compartment at the VIN plate and noticed it had 200632 stamped on it and
right beneath it on the frame (body).

So my conclusion is that the divider behind the front seat was replaced at
some time of the buses life.

Also, where can I find the m-codes for this bus?  I have never owned a
bench-seat splitty, yet alone one as old as this one.
