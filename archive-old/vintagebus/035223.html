Guess you have to drain those float bowls when storing a carb... dont forget.

Hi Steve,
Yes it really helps to drain it completely and allow it to dry out with the 
top off for a night at least.  The red stuff is probably the remains of the 
old leaded additive before lead fuel dissappeared.  We noticed it tended to 
turn our plugs red.  Eric&amp;Barb
