Hi Rex,
BTDT!  Did you torque the lug bolts to 80-85 Ft. Lbs. ?  Then after driving a 
couole of miles did you recheck the toque just to be sure that some bit of 
grit had not been ground out from between the rim and the drum?
   If you did/do not use a torque wrench make darned sure to check the lug 
bolts for tightness in less than a mile!   Eric&amp;Barb
