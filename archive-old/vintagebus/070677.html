Subject: Re: [VB] welding prep advice

Have you got a drill press? If so you could get a drill bit that is the same
diameter as the tube and drill out the cut-out for the intersecting tube.
This would make a clean cut and would also make short work of cutting the
ends.

Welding the tubes together is no prob. cutting them is no problem.
What I'm having trouble w/ is cutting the butt joints. I need to be
able to (hopefully quickly) cut a simi-circle in the end of some of
the tubes so that making a tee w/ two tubes is possible and close
fitting before welding.
