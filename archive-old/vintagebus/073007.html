&gt; Dual port has a few more horsepower than SP.   DP also has less metal between

Is this true with the Mexican long-reach heads?  I'm pretty certain that
they went to long reach plugs to beef up that crack-prone area.

I haven't got enough miles on my Mexican engine to contemplate pulling the
heads yet, but perhaps someone else has.
