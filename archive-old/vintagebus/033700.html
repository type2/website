Subject: RE: [VB] Tranny blues

  The problem is that the GERMANY mounts are just India with a plate slipped
in the mold saying GERMANY not MADE in Germany, so unless you find some MADE
in Germany mounts all your going to get are INDIA mounts with Germany molded
in them. Another way to get around the law. I am out of GENUINE German
nosecone mounts and have been using and selling GENUINE VW Mexico cradle
mounts. The so called GERMANY cradle mounts are INDIA, again with the
GERMANY name molded in, NOT Made in Germany. This is a buyer beware, even
though I haven't seen any major problem with the India mounts being they
make them for over half the auto manufacturers in the world. If you really
want to find out where auto parts come from for a lot of auto companies meet
me in Las Vegas the first week of November and come to the SEMA EXPO and
meet all the OEM manufacturers from India, other middle eastern countries,
Asian and South American, for some reason there aren't very many European
manufacturers there, must be a message. You probably wouldn't be amazed to
find out that at least half the parts in NEW VW of are Asian and Middle
Eastern manufacturer. I could go on a long time with even more examples but
don't want to bum you all.

Hi Volks,
Not normal and rather bad for the tranny in the long run.  Sounds like a 
broken front and/or perhaps rear tranny mount/s.  The new India made mounts 
are junk, so unless you want to replace these mounts about every six 
months.....     Eric&amp;Barb
