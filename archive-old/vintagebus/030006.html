Subject: Hosed rear axle threads.  Got any?

Hello, list.

I have a '65 camper (of some as yet determined variety) and I have
pureed the threads on the driver's side big nut rear 24 tooth rear axle
stub (it still hurts too badly to explain how.  Moral: never rush your
work).  I have 1 and 3/32 inches in diameter of material left on it.  Do
I dare to take it to a machine shop to re-thread it to a smaller nut of
some variety?  Intuitively, that seems like a bad idea to me, but if
it's safe to do, I'll give it a shot.

Otherwise, does anyone have a good 24 tooth big nut stub axle lying
around they want to unload?  I'll take a whole reduction box if you
don't wanna take it apart.

Much thanks.

Michael
