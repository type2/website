A friend came over today and needed some brushes installed in his generator. 
He pointed to something hanging from the inside of the engine compartment 
and asked me what it was. He said it was hooked to the starter and it had a 
heat sink on it also. Is this what some people call a fast starter system 
(or something like that)
