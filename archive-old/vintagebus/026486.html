Subject: [VB] Leaking RGB's
Message-ID: &lt;3853F472.53E49839_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

Well,

I finally got around to finding out why my RGB's are leaking like crazy
today.  I knew it was a problem with the plugs at the back of the boxes,
but until I unbolted them I just thought they were leaking around the
edges.  Well this bus is rusty...very rusty.  Little did I know that it
was so rusty, that the RGB plugs are rusted through.  The gear oil is
literally seeping through the center of the plugs.

Obviously I can't weld a nut to them and pull them out.  I can take a
screwdriver to them and I'm sure they will just crumble.  I assume that
the edges of the plugs will be rusted tight, how would I go about
getting the remnants out?

Are replacements available??  If not, does anyone know of a good
replacement?  Freeze plug maybe??
