Subject: Re:  [VB] Resto of backing plates

Yes they are front and back.   yes the front are riveted on the plate.  
Pictures of the adjuster keeper springs are in the brake section of the 
bentley book.  Page B-5 1 has a nice pic of the 64-67 rear brakes , #7 ing 
the diagram being he piece you are asking about.  age B-5 8 has a pic of the 
rear 55-63 brakes that has a better view.  Yes they are right next to where 
the arms of the star would go.   For better adjusting, lube the stars and 
shoes bolts and where the star goes in the bit on the backing plate so it 
won't stick, then it is realy easy to turn the stars.  But without the 
keepers they will then self deadjust  :(

...............
some responses intrigued me.  It seems there are
supposed to be little pieces of metal for each
adjusting star to prevent them from turning
inadvertently?  On the four I have, none have such a
piece of metal, although there are little pop-riveted
sections (top and bottom) right near where the
adjusting starts would be on the front set.  What is
the shape of these little gems?  Does anyone have any
pictures of them?  Could I just drill the pop-rivets
out and make new pieces to replace what broke off and
rivet them back on?  Are there supposed to be some for
the back ones as well?
