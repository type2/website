Subject: '66 21 Window FS

Hi list-

Spent 4 hours today walking just about the entire parking lot at 
Qualcomm stadium.  This is the weekend of the annual &quot;Big Three&quot; swap 
meet here in San Diego.  It is about the only event I have seen that 
rivals Pomona - at least in terms of size.  As the name would 
suggest, the focus is on American Iron, and there was a high 
concentration of the knuckle-dragging hot rod types ;)!

Anyway, there was a pretty decent 66 21 window bench seat bus. 
Looked reasonably complete, but the middle seat (which was turned 
around to face the rear) didn't look quite right.  The guy even had 
the original delivery shipping document.  Anyway, he was asking 
$8500, and was apparently very anxious to sell it this w/e.

P-mail me if interested.
