wow... I was born March 8th, 1971... doomed in a way, says I. Pigpen
passed away exactly on my second birthday, so I was destined to never be
able to see the Dead play on my birthday :(
	no matter... at least I have the satisfaction of being some kind of
21st anniversary edition human commemorative of the 1st production bus
;)
