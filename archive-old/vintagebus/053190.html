Subject: Re: [BSKA] my new bus/here we go



One word,   YIKES!!!
You are one brave guy.

I had to download the photos and then bring them up in my photo software and
lighten them up to see all the gory details.  It was quite revealing.

Does it now or did it ever run?
Was that engine mated up to the VW trans?
What changes were made inside?  racing seats?
Those tires (the ones still in place) look like its been sitting for years.

have fun,

Scott

BTW ronnie, know of anyone out there in the desert in need of a dump truck?
The college club that I'm advisor for is auctioning a 1965 Ford Dump truck on
ebay.
We drove the thing a couple weeks ago, the five miles to move it to its current
location.

&gt;    I picked up another bus today, it's a 1960 kombi/truck powered by a old
&gt; Chevy iron duke engine. A true piece of make what you got work (watch out
&gt; Road Cow).
