Only a few days after the end of the epic Southern Journey, I was preparing
the bus for yet another camping event.  This one was going to be down in the
boonies of Missouri, near the Lake of the Ozarks.  In attendance would be
members of the Missouri Micros, Kansas City Kombi's, and SAMBA, all Missouri
chapters of NEATO.  The campground was the &quot;Lazy 'K'&quot; near the Lake dam, and
the 'main drag' of the lake area.

Friday morning, I get to a late start, and set off making preparations for
the weekend...  clean out the bus - which was still a mess from the Southern
journey -  and get the gear together, pack clothes, etc.  I don't get out
the door until about 3, and I had wanted to be there by then!  My 1st stop
was the local grocery, and as I pulled into the parking lot, I spotted the
Yosemite Yellow roundy owned by fellow Micro Steve Lashley.   I park next it
(for the karma) and head inside.  There, I caught up with Steve in the
frozen foods isle, and we chatted about our plans for the weekend.  He was
getting groceries, and planned on returning to work for a short time, and
heading to the campground.  We would be taking the same route, so Steve
would prolly catch up to me later.

My 2nd stop was the gas station, and I also got some ice since I forgot to
do so at the grocery store. After that, it was the Highway!  Just as I was
turning onto 44, it started to rain pretty good, and continued to come down
for a good half hour or so. Traffic was pretty screwed up because of it, and
it took me a lot longer than it should have to get to hwy 50 to Jefferson
City.   In Union, MO, right at 44 &amp; 50, I stopped at one of those 'Super&quot;
Wally-Worlds.. I wanted to get me one of those swanky propane gas
camp-grills for the weekend, so I would never have to mess around with
charcoal and lighter fluid and all that mess ever again.  The Wally-World
was one of those mega-centers, with a super market, a Wal-Mart, Tire shop,
eye glass center, law firm, tractor repair, etc all in one.  So after the
mile hike to the camping goods, and not finding anything, then hiking to the
regular grill section, I found my grill. I nifty little until for only 17$.
I then had the privilege of standing in line behind 2 ma &amp; pa Kettle types,
who must have been stocking up their Y2K shelters or something that weekend,
because they each had about 3 mega-Wally-Karts full of crap.  You see, in
Sam Waltons infinite wisdom, there are no separate check-out lines for the
grocery store, the Wally World, etc. so I get to stand in line for ( I swear
I am not making this up) one whole hour to buy my one damned grill for the
weekend.  (No, there were NO express lanes, just all regular lanes).  I was
in line SO long, I actually watched a shift-change of check-out girls!

I am NEVER going to a Wal-Mart again as long as I live.

So I continue on, navigating the curvy, rolling hills of hwy 50, with my
pathetic SP motor overheating, and barely pushing me along.  There was A LOT
of traffic backed up behind me at times, especially on the hills, and
several times I had to pull over to let them pass.  As I rolled into
Jefferson City - the capitol of Missouri - I kept a sharp eye out for my
turn south onto 54.  Only it turns out 54 is marked east and west, even
though it *distinctly* travels north &amp; south on the map.  GGGRRRRRR...  I
miss my turn...   I turn around for a second pass...  and going from this
way, the exit is marked AFTER the turn-off, and you can't see it until
you're past it.  I miss it a third time.  Turn around again, this time
turning onto the West-bound ramp.... There is a turn you're supposed to make
on the ramp, but it's not well marked... and I miss it for a FOURTH time...
turn around again, and from this direction you CAN'T GET ON going west!!!
Well I'm pretty damned steamed by then, and so a couple of highly illegal
maneuvers later, I'm heading down highway 54 West (south).  Soon after, I
need gas, so I stop - I've only come about 100 miles.. man an I getting
crappy mileage! And then I'm back on the road.

I arrive at the camp-ground about 9PM or so, in utter darkness... I had
almost missed the turn to the camp-ground as well, since the road its on
wasn't on any maps, even my AAA Map 'N Go CD.  I pull up to the tent loop,
and there I see quite a few buses there already.. Pink Newell, Dave Filcoff,
a large Springfield contingent, and STEVE LASHLEY are there.. How the heck
did Steve get ahead of me? We went the same way, but I never saw him pass
me!  Oh well...  I pick a somewhat level spot, and start setting up camp.
There is plenty of open area to be found, all level for the most part, and
tons of picnic tables!  Usually campgrounds really skimp one those. Well,
they must have spent TOO much money on tables though, because there wasn't a
trash can in sight.   Setting up merely involved setting u my side-tent,
which went up in a few minutes, and I set about assembling my hard-earned
new camp-grill.  It was Bratwurst time dammit!

Not long after I pulled up, Curt Dilday, and Shannon Darroset showed up,
soon followed by Rick Dennis.  The Micros was making a strong showing after
all!  We all got situated, and busted out the brews and brats.  Rick made
fast work of getting a camp fire going, and we all loved that.. it was
pretty darned cold that night.. the river ( forget which) was literally only
a few hundred feet away, just beyond a row of trees.  About 10 or so, a few
more KC folks show up, and this time its Glen and John in a newly acquired
'67 Westy, that's VERY complete, but pretty rough body-wise.  Turns out
John's infamous 23-Window threw a rod only the day before, and there was no
time to get a new motor thrown together.  Glen's Westy though wasn't even
running, and they had stayed up all night getting wiring bugs, and brakes
and things worked out, just in time to leave late Friday.   John drives a
truck for a thrift store, so he gets 1st pickins on some fine schwag, and
when a whole set of turquoise Melmac dishes came in, he instantly thought of
me, and saved them for me!   Gave them to me no charge!  God I love these
guys!  They also happen to be good friends of a former owner of my bus, who
allegedly knows the whereabouts of the original side tents and poles for the
bus.. a search and rescue mission is in the makings..   ;-)

Soon we all retired, to our busses, and the next morning we awoke to a gray,
overcast sky - it was supposed to be nice out today...  hmmm.. More
socializing is at hand, and a few more busses show up in the morning hours.
About 10 or so, MO Micro Rick Babor shows up in his newly lowered (DKB
Style) 60 mango/gray standard.  This thing is SLAMMED, and it has the
shortest tires I've ever seen wrapped around stock 15&quot; bus rims.  Rick was
not in the best of moods.  On the way down, he was drafting some 18-wheeler,
when it blew a tread, and it dented in the bottom of the 'V' on the front
pretty badly. Then one of his wiper arms blew off when he turned on the
wipers, and then he was cold, so he wanted to turn on the heat, but had to
dig out the jack to toe open the heat exchangers since you can't fit under
the bus anymore.  As a matter of fact, it's so low he had to jack it up to
retrieve a lost flashlight, and to change the back wheels, you need to
jacks... one to jack up the bus, and another to wedge between the frame and
spring plate to spread it out....    Rick's excited about it all, but I
don't know man, that stuff just ain't my bag.  At least he did a real nice,
and proper job of it all...

After some hemming and hawing, it was decided that a mini-caravan to 'the
strip' was in order.  Me, Curtis, and Shannon hopped into Rick Babors
low-rider, Rick Dennis, Pink, Glen and others followed in their busses.  We
made a quick stop at an overlook place near the Lake of the Ozarks Dam, and
just as we were pulling into it, Rick hit a little bump, which bottomed out
the bus right on the steering box, which shorted the horn wire out, which of
course, caused the horn to blare VERY loudly.  With near Flash-Gordon fast
reflexes, Rick ripped the horn button off the wheel to stop the horn, but
not before upsetting a group of people who were trying to fish by the dam.
Curtis, Shannon and I were laughing ourselves silly, and all Rick could do
was look embarrassed and tell us to 'shut up'.  Man, I STILL get a kick out
of that one!  ;-)   We looked around, walked out on the dam, etc. and
continued on to the infamous strip.

On the strip we saw all manner of tourist traps.  Head shops, sexy lingerie
stores, flings, mini-golf, sunglass huts, overpriced souvenir  shops, a
giant Huck Finn, a giant Indian, and giant bear on a roof... Hot wheels
shops, NASCAR shops, you name it.   My favorite item in one of the shops was
Tommy Chong's &quot;Ur-In Luck&quot; a system 'cleaner' if you get my meaning.  It was
that same shop that the skull-guy from Kansas City must have gotten all his
'accessories' from too ;-)

Rick Dennis bought some NASCAR stuff, Cutis bought some new moccasins, and I
think a few others picked up some items as well, but I held back.. I'm on a
budget remember?  So, after the shopping was done, our next stop was a
pretty kewl mini-golf place.  We broke into teams, with Rick B. and the
Dennises on one team, and Curt, Shannon, Glen, Pink and I on another... oh,
and John too.  I don't recall who won, but it was probably Glenn,, that boy
is all about swing!  We had one heck of a good time though, and that's
what's important, right?  We also got to see lots and lots of decent looking
skanky-chicks....  There must have been some sort of convention that day ;-)

Well, all that golf-playing worked up an appetite,  so we headed back to
camp.  Rick demonstrated the capabilities of his new T3 trannied bus, by
driving down a hill that had the speedo wrapped around to zero again, with
the motor revved out at about 7 grand it sounded like ( I expected a rod to
come flying out any second) and we were only going 55 mph or so!  Gotta love
those short little tires.

Back at the camp-out, a few more Springfield busses had shown up, and were
setting up camp.  Lance Moeller being one of them.  We fixed some dinner
(brats and some 'gray matter' burgers in honor of absent friends) and Rick
D. shows up with a whiffle ball set!  An all-out Split Vs. Roundy match was
thrown together.  I'd like to say that the splities slaughtered the
roundies, but they said it was a tie.... Yeah, right..

Soon it was dark, and everyone had gathered around a huge community
camp-fire built by the GROOVE contingent.  There was drinkin', smores makin'
and lie tellin' for everyone!  Late that night, Tom
Neidernsmedenkildenhoffer showed up in the infamous 'Flood-Bus', complete
with drinking buddy!  We sit and talk and eat and drink for hours.  Tom
demonstrated the &quot;Billy-Bob&quot; teeth that would be going to Germany with he
and Bowman on the &quot;Return to the Fatherland Tour&quot; and we laughed our asses
off at that, and we had fun setting marshmallows on the head of some GROOVE
guy who had passed out by the fire.  About 2AM, he got up and started
stumbling around his bus.. we thought he was draining the weasel, but he was
really taking down the GROOVE banner that was tied to his bus!  (??  What
the heck??).   Anyway, we all retired for the night after that stage show.

The morning I awoke with one hum-dinger of a headache and the sound of rain
pouring down on the roof of the bus. Funny, it was perfectly clear out when
we went to bed.  I  bed as long as I could, thinking that it was really
pouring outside, but when I finally did rise, I found it was only barely
drizzling.... That bus roof sure is loud in the rain!   Thank god for the
Reimo side tents though, as we all had refuge under mine and Steve Lashley's
enormous tents.  After a breakfast of powder doughnuts and orange juice,
everyone started going their separate ways.   It was still only slightly
raining, but as everyone pulled out, and Steve and I were left behind to
take down out tents, it *really* stated pouring!  What a bummer!  I didn't
even bother to try and pack mine back in to the bag, I just wrapped it up
and threw it in between the back seats. I would have to set it up again
right away anyway to dry it out.  I was done a bit before Steve, and pulled
on out, waving goodbye to the few who still remained.  I stopped at the
Dumpster on the way out (the only trash can in the whole place) and got back
on the highway.

Instead of going home 50 to 44, I decided to take 54 all the way to 70, and
take that back, possibly stopping at Rick B or Rick D's on the way.  The
road back was treacherous!  My windows were all fogged up, despite a liberal
coating of Fog-X, and the rain was leaking in all over, and it had somehow
found its way into my fresh air vent, filling up my gauges! Plus with the
weak motor, and the winds, I could barely make 50mph.. with the motor
running over 500 on the heads!  And it was a COLD and RAINY day... I was
genuinely worried I wouldn't make it back.

As I was approaching my turn onto 70, Tom Neidensmedenklinkenglenkinhoffer
sped by in the flood bus...  I guess his blown generator wasn't slowing him
down much!  I tried to follow along behind him for a while, but eventually I
was not able too keep up, and watched as he disappeared over the horizon.
It was still raining a bit, and the gauges were filling up again ( I had
already stopped once to drain them out).  And I was getting pretty irritated
by the weather and all, and decided to skip my stops at the Babors or the
Dennises, and drive straight home.

I arrived back home an hour or so later, wet, cold, and tired.  Before
heading inside, I drained out the gauges one last time.  It continued to
rain for the next 3 days or so, and all the while the tent was soaked.  I
managed to rig up a line n the garage to hang it on, but the leaky roof and
the humidity didn't let it dry out for quite some time.

Soon I would be starting work on swapping the motor back out to the old DP,
as this one had me on the ends of my ropes.
The VW circle of life...  never-ending!
