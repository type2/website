Subject: The Hoke, the poke -- banish now thy doubt

passing it on for all to enjoy....

The following is from the Washington Post Style Invitational contest that 
asks readers to submit &quot;instructions&quot; for something (anything), but 
written in the style of a famous person. The winning entry was The Hokey 
Pokey (as written by W. Shakespeare). 


O proud left foot, that ventures quick within
Then soon upon a backward journey lithe.
Anon, once more the gesture, then begin:
Command sinistral pedestal to writhe.
Commence thou then the fervid Hokey-Poke,
A mad gyration, hips in wanton swirl.
To spin! A wilde release from Heavens yoke.
Blessed dervish! Surely canst go, girl.
The Hoke, the poke -- banish now thy doubt
Verily, I say, 'tis what it's all about.
-- by William Shakespeare
(Jeff Brechlin, Potomac Falls)
