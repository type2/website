&gt; Since Thom has committed himself to the drive down, I suggest we all meet at
&gt; his canary yellow VintageBus logoed panel. Say 10:00? Failing that, Harry is
&gt; buying all listees a pint at the brewpub across  Katela from the OCTO site.
&gt; I'll be driving Rosie (Red and white doublecab), Harry will be in his RAL
&gt; 2000 (orange juice) colored doublecab and Thom in yellow. Should make a
&gt; colorful group. See y'all there.
