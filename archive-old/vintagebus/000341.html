&lt;&lt; when I turned the car off, and pulled the keys out, the engine kept

anomaly...But it happened again today, but just once(ie the next two times i

Hi Kevin,
Sounds like you have too big of jetting in the carb and are running hot 
enough to get the carbon in the ctlinder to glow enough to ignite the 
fuel/air mixture when the ignition is off.  Too rich of fuel mixture really 
increases the carbon deposits in thier and thusly increases the possibility 
of run on.  If it was a loose connection to a idle jet with solinoid shut 
off.  When the solinoid would not get electricity this would cause the idle 
circuit to shut off the fuel.  Thus it just would not idle.  
   So best thing to do is clean the carb and check jet sizes against simular 
stock engine jet sizes.
