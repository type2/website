&lt;&lt; I have eight rims, all 14&quot; and would like to keep them but want to know if 
they are all the same. Some have 5JK X 14 stamped on them and some don't have 
that.&gt;&gt;
Hi Andre,
If the rims you have are 14&quot; type they are for the 1964-1970ish bus.  T1, and 
1955-early 1964 buses used a 15&quot; rim.    Eric&amp;Barb
