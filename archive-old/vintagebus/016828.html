&gt; &lt;&lt; The reduction boxes make noise at a low
&gt; speed--But at 50 to 55mph  there 
&gt; is not a sound out of them? &gt;&gt;

does it sort of wind up and change pitch with the
rmps?  i had this problem with my rgbs. i had a worn
out bearing in the passenger side one. if this is it,
i would definitly get the bearing replaced asap.  mine
didn't make much noise at 50-55 either and i think i
just didn't notice it as much because of the constant
pitch as opposed to it changing while accelerating.
they are a b~tch to get out, too. we had to drill a
hole it the blocking plate behind it and pry it off.
then just JB weld it up again. it's held ever since,
too.
