Volks,

I need to have some L82 Silver White whipped up so's when I can walk again I
can finish painting bits of the '55.  Unfortunately, I don't
have any decent bits with the paint in good condition that I can
have matched; does anyone have a formula, or a matching modern
car color that's close?  Or do y'all just wing it?

Thom
