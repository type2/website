Subject: the Term &quot;Split Window&quot;

First, lemme zipper up my asbestos flame suit.

I don't like, and very rarely use, the terms &quot;Split Window&quot; or &quot;Splittie&quot;
Early buses came first.  They are buses.  Bay window buses are ... bay window
buses.  The term &quot;split window&quot; implies that they have to be distinguished
from buses - but they are buses.  Also, the window isn't split - there are two
of them. If I have to refer to my bus such that I distinguish it from a bay
window bus then I call it &quot;my early bus&quot;  or &quot;my 60.&quot;  Am I alone in this?  Do
I need to just get a grip?

jdd 60 std (early bus,)  78 westy (bay window fat chick)
