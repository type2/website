Subject: Re: [T2] DM revisited was Windshield Runaround

Hello all,

I generally dont post on here much anymore, but this one made me do it.

I'm sorry but the only reason to have the german glass is because you are
a resto-purist. All laminated windshield glass must meet the same
standards, get glass that has a safety compliance logo on it and you are
all set.

$189 for a bus windshield is crazy! but, i'm not a resto purist.  Sure if
I ran into good OG glass I wouldnt hit it with a hammer, but wow, $189.

But, then again, there are people on this list that put creative
engineering safaris in their bus, keep the tempered glass, and drive it.
I'd say that shows a complete lack of brains, but thats me. There is a
RESAON that no new cars have tempered windshields, they are a dumb idea.

Basically, I dont get people risking a face/nose/eye/mouth full of glass
cubes at high velocity, and I dont get paying $189 for OG glas.

ah well, guess im just not up with the times...

take care,

Steve
