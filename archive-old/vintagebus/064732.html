Subject: Re: [VB]  A dumb question

65 has a speaker under the dash.  found a speaker than mostly fit the 
bracket, but sometimes when I have the wipers going the speaker goes on/off 
as teh wiper mechanism goes by.

 Getting the whole thing installed is a matter of some choice and skill
 as the package tray, grab handle hardware, and wiper mechanism will
 complicate the installation of speaker and bracket.
