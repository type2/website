&gt;Was writ:

&gt;To get really technical, the brake drums, stub axles, etc., were 2
month only
&gt;M215 parts.  These were indeed later 64-67 (rear shoes) on an early
small 

&gt;And was clara-fied:
&gt;-- - - --
&gt;actually the 63 M 215 option was available more than 2 months- think
the 
&gt;entire 63 model year it was available.  (But I have not checked any 
&gt;refenences for that )  Why do you say it was only used 2 months?

The NEATO old bus registry has one bus with M215, chassis 1.170.517,
made September 17, 1963.  It's a Fire Truck made to remain in Germany. 
How many on Vintagebus Registry?  Who else has one?

hey actually I just looked at my parts list and I think we were actually 
talking about M 216- the 63 version which updates Brakes and motor.  believe 
the 215 is the llater (64) version) offered from 1 144 282 when the 64-67 
brakes were already stanadard equipment.   
How  many M 216 do you have in your list?

thought I sent the m codes for an early 64 m 215 panel van  (now dead)  will 
check back with the vin.  well, the panel had the 1500 tag on it.
