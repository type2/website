&lt;&lt; we asked them if they always keep 
 there cars so low on gas?  &quot;Yes!&quot; they said and we asked them &quot;What would 
 they do if one of their family had to get to the hospital quickly?&quot;, tell 
 them &quot;Just a minute honey while we get some gas!&quot;, when minutes matter?  We 
 informed them we filled ours when hitting about half a tank just in case for 
 emergency and only going below this on long mileage trips when we would plan 
 our fuel ups carefully. &gt;&gt;

A good practice! In August 1996 there was a very large blackout here in 
NorCal. I was very low on gas, so I pulled into a gas station in San Bruno 
near work.  &quot;Sorry, our power is out.&quot;  Went down the street, same thing.  
Went across town, same thing. Turning on the news radio station, I find that 
power was out for most of the Northern State. So, I decided to drive up El 
Camino Real until I run out of gas, or PG&amp;E comes through. Of course since 
ATM's require electricity I have about three bucks cash on me. Luckily there 
was about a three block area in Daly City where the power was on, with a gas 
station.&quot;Three bucks on number four please.&quot;

Telling my tale at work the next day, one of my coworkers really chewed me 
out since this is earthquake country, and should always have enough gas to 
get home, or to a hospital, etc., etc....
