Hi Brad.. [....]
I came in late on this one...
but it looks as if your points are not opening...
keep everything the same, the light attached to the dist wire and to
positive battery, and take the dist cap off. turn on the igntion switch
and turn the engine over by hand, keeping an eye on the light and the
points... if the points don't open, the light will stay on,
If this is your problem,,, turn off the ignition and regapp your
points...start all over again.
I hope that helps

&gt;
&gt;Trying to set the timing, at 10 degrees BTDC statically, as was
suggested to
&gt;me by Steven Howell, thanks again btw. Thing is, I have my lead hooked
to
&gt;the wire on the back of the distributor, but, the light is always on.
The
&gt;other day when I tried to time it, it was onlyon when #1 fired, and if
I
&gt;backed it off, the light went off, like its supposed to? But now, it
just
&gt;stays on, I rotated the engine a complete turn and it stayed on the
whole
&gt;time. I'm lost, please tell me I didn't destroy anyything. The bus ran
fine
&gt;all last summer, I just want it to run like that again. Thanks, and any
and
&gt;all help is better than what I have now :)
