Subject: FS:Complete lowered front end in CA...$75

Thought I'd pass this along for anyone in that area that wants to lower
their front end. Here's one so you can store the one you've got and keep it
in original condition. That way the next owner won't have to hunt one down,
or if you want to go back UP you can. Anyway...contact him not me. I know
nothing:
