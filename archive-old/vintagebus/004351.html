Big buck busses seem to have spread to the UK. Prices are on the increase
over here also, with show quality 23-window deluxes around the 11-12,000
pound mark ($20,000??)
The buses in the link below are expensive, but I think Splits are a rarer
commodity over here when compared to the States or some of the Scandinavian
countries.
