&gt; And we're forgetting the main advantage of those LEDs - and the reason

&gt; before they're fully on.  At freeway speeds, this can amount to several
&gt; feet of elapsed distance before your brakelights are totally illuminated.  

No arguement there!  This is apparent with cars that use LEDs in their
center brake lights and bulbs in the side lights.

I was going to experiment with using LEDs installed in holes through the
taillight lens.  No reflector required with this arrangement, and much
lower current draw.  If oriented correctly (LED axis pointed at observer),
these things are _bright_!  

I don't know how well they will work in the replacement bulbs through
conventional lenses.  LEDs of this type work project their light in one
direction only, rather than omnidirectionally as a conventional bulb does.
Since the lens and reflector are designed to direct the light in the
correct direction, it might not work so well with an LED bulb that
projects its light in  one direction only.
