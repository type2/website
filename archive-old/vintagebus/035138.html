To All:

Thank you all for the many suggestions and comments about my Subaru 
conversion, with special thanks to Mark (cncvw_at_primenet_dot_com) who is actually 
driving a Soob conversion... and has been for three years, making his advice 
especially valuable.

A few comments were negative, a couple anonymously so.  For the few who felt 
I was perverting some ideal by even considering a non-VW powerplant, they may 
have lost sight of the fact that the youngest buses have the rarest engine -- 
Type IV's are becoming increasingly difficult to find and expensive when you 
do.  

As to the various plumbing comments, running pipes of suitable size from 
front to rear is actually a rather trivial task.  First, you lay out the 
path.  Then you chop the holes, which may be large and rectilinear.  Then you 
do the actual plumbing, typically using steel tubing having an ID of 1.5&quot; and 
a sixteenth wall.  One reason for using this size is its wide availability -- 
it is the smallest common diameter &amp; wall of exhaust pipe.  And the reason 
for using exhaust pipe is because nearly every town has someone who can swage 
the stuff, meaning they have the tools that can expand the end of one piece 
of tubing so as to accept the end of another.  All the curves &amp; angles you'll 
need are available from J.C.Whitney as stock shapes.

When you lay out your plumbing run you simply include sufficient overlap to 
accomodate a swaged end.  Not accounting for the curvey bits, you should be 
able to do the entire run with four pieces.  Why four?  Because you must use 
shorter pieces in order to fit them through the holes you've made in the 
cross-members.

To deal with the holes, you make cover plates.  A cover plate is any 
convenient shape of metal having a hole that will accept the tubing and which 
will fit flat over the holes you've chopped.  You thread the cover plates 
onto your tubing as you fit the tubing into place.  Once the tubing is brazed 
together, you weld the cover plates to the cross-members -- where they now 
serve as doublers, making up for the strength that was lost when you chopped 
the hole -- simply tack-weld you new plumbing run to each cover plate at two 
points, using at least half an inch of bead.

To braze the tubing together, use a nickel-based eutectic brazing compound.  
This comes in the form of a paste.  You simply wipe it on the cleaned 
surfaces of the joint, socket them together and raise the joint to a uniform 
red heat.  Because of the tight fit of the swaged ends and the high strength 
of the nickel-based braze (70kpsi... stronger than the tubing!), you end up 
with a strong, leak-free joint.

I've described this procedure because it applies to both radiators and 
heaters.  It also applies regardless of the radiator location.  Pipe is more 
efficient than hose and some amount of pipe would be used even when the 
radiator is installed in the rear of the vehicle.  

The plumbing run for the heater should be of smaller diameter tubing and 
would normally be insulated.  In this case, your cover plates would be fitted 
with a collar at least half an inch wider than the heater pipe.  On 
installation, the heater pipe is isolated within the center of each collar 
and the void filled with urethane foam.  This serves to both support and 
thermally insulate the heater pipe.  (If you welded it to the cover plates 
the water would cool down too much before it got to the heater's core :-)

When laying out such a system it's assumed that suitable drains would be 
installed.

After installing such plumbing it's SOP to pressurize the system and check 
for leaks.

----------------------------------

A couple of comments touched on the wisdom of buying an entire vehicle simply 
to obtain the engine.  Insanity was mentioned but only in the friendliest way 
('You're out of your rabbit-assed mind!')

Actually, the stripping of cars is a common thing.  Before the body is 
crushed the power train, running gear and interior are normally removed.  
Using torches, two men can usually strip a car in ten minutes or less.

Car thieves do much the same.  If the car was stolen in order to be 'dropped' 
, the thieves generally remove only the engine, doors and seats, all of which 
are carefully preserved.  The chassis is then 'dropped' somewhere along the 
freeway system where it is immediately found and hauled to an impound yard.   
(By dropping it along a particular section of freeway it will end up in a 
particular impound yard.) After the carcus has been declared a total loss, it 
will be auctioned for scrap... at which time the thieves will buy it (!)  The 
engine, doors and seats will be carefully re-installed and the thieves will 
then have a high-value late-model vehicle with a clear title.

If the car was stolen specifically to be 'chopped' (ie, stripped for parts), 
a team of three to five men (women too) will take from one to three hours to 
reduce the thing to a bare chassis.  (The most common purchasers of such 
parts are car dealers, although they don't like to talk about it :-)  

Working alone, without air tools or a hoist, over the past nine days I've 
spent about forty hours to reduce the 1985 Subaru station wagon to its 
component parts, right down to individual brake lines and electrical 
harnesses. (I'm still in the process of cutting up the body.)  I've already 
sold enough of the parts to cover the cost of the vehicle.  Which means I've 
obtained the engine I wanted for 'free'.  Hopefully, I'll eventually sell the 
remainder for enough to cover the time spent dismantling the thing.  Indeed, 
I may show a nice profit for my forty hours.  So mebbe I'm not quite as crazy 
as I seem :-)
