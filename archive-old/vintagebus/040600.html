Hey, has anyone else seen this?  I was at my local Barnes and Noble today
looking for VolksWorld or TotalVW and came across the US-made VW Classics
magazine.  Eh, I figured, it was better than nothing to read while the
sealant on my roofrack was drying, right?  Well, wow...premiere issue has
the restored Telefunken '54 Panel, coverage of BBBIV, and a pic of Chuck &amp;
Jan Covington's Double Cab in the reader's rides area!  Keep an eye out for
this one...

-Taylor
