Subject: VWOA calendar

On my route I have to deliver to the local Volkswagen
dealership. And today I had to go to the bodyshop, and
on the counter was a VWOA calendar of aircooled VW's,
it had some catchy name to it like Classic Originals
or whatever or something like that. And it said
genuine VW's use Genuine parts, does that mean that VW
will be selling restoration products or are they
already? Anyways the calendar shows your typical cars
in there typical poses in front of some palm trees or
in a business complex with the concrete watered down.
The funnyies thing is a crewcab that was painted two
tone some god awful colors and it had a sunroof! The
dealership did have its name printed on it so they
must be a promotional tool.
 Mike
