&lt;&lt; also: SPLASH PAN WARNING!!! I picked up a set of
 splash pans, only to find out they were '68 and not
 split bus (thanks Wolfsburg West booth guy). Luckily
 the swap seller was cool enough to take them back. But
 check out your pans before you buy them. On the
 correct (split) ones, there is a notch in them about
 3+ inches before the inner end (where the overrider
 goes) and the mounting bracket nearest the end of the
 bumper has a nut welded in it. The later one has an
 oblongated hole and a carriage bolt where it bolts to
 the bumper near its end. Make sense? Just beware if
 you are a stickler for correctness. The late ones will
 fit with some mods. (further reading, see: vintage
 nazis) &gt;&gt;

Vintage people already know how to tell the difference.
