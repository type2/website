&gt;
&gt;the only problem was 2 of the wire ends being bad--one had 10k
&gt;resistance, the other was cracked (but only had 5k resistance).

You're talking about the plastic things that go between the top
of the spark plug and the wire, right?  As far as I know, this
is the only resistance in a VW spark plug wire assembly.  I know
there are wires made that have resistance in the wire but I don't
think VWs use these.

&gt;so i put in a set of n.o.s. BERU wire ends with 0k ohm resistance.

That's interesting.  Do they have a little zigzag line (schematic
symbol for resistance) molded into the plastic?  If they do they
should have _some_ resistance.

&gt;anyone know of a reason this (the 0k ohm resistance) could/would be 
&gt;bad for the ignition system?

It _might_ result in lower voltage at the spark plugs, because now
the HV only has to get high enough to jump the plug gap, instead of
getting high enough to travel through the resistance AND jump the
plug gap.  The current on the secondary of your coil might be a
little more, too, but I don't know if this will cause any problems.

I hope this helps!
