Getting Rosie ready to go on a road trip this weekend. Decided it was time
to change to Castrol 40 wt., especially since she had been running a little
warm last trip and air temps have been pushing 100 around here. After
thinking about it for a few minutes, I wondered if the slightly elevated
temps might be related to the new vibration I have been hearing. While
waiting for the oil to drain, I reached around into the fan and, lo and
behold, there were the remains of a paper towel, enough to choke down the
air flow. As has been said before, don't keep that grease rag in the engine
compartment, or at least install a clip to hold on to it. Were it not for
the fact that Rosie generally runs very cool, I would have probably cooked
the engine.
