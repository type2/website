No, not equally tight - just to 215 - 250 foot pounds, which you can and
should do yourself. If you get a 3/4&quot; drive breaker bar, and socket, and a
2 or 3 foot piece of pipe to go over it, you just mark the pipe where you
need to stand on it, for your weight, and carefully lift yourself onto the
pipe with your weight on one foot, grabbing the roof-drain of your bus,
then letting go, barely leaning on the side of your bus, and allow the nut
to turn til it stops. Then only a bit tighter if necessary, to fit the
cotter pin thru the hole in the nut and axle.

You calculate the place on the pipe to apply your weight using weight
times distance from socket equals foot pounds, which should equal 215 or
slightly more, but no more than 250.

Example: If you weigh 250, you stand one foot from the socket. If you
weigh 130 like me, you stand a bit less than two feet away.

Important thing is not to bounce on the pipe. Just allow your weight to
turn the nut til it stops.

&gt; that big nut needs to go back on equally tight.
