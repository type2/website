 68 - early 69 were round and black. They were 56 1/4'' long.
 They bent very easily.
 Sometime in early 69 the bars changed to 3 sided galvanized. They were
 stronger. From 68 to 73 all were 56 1/4'' long. They stored up on top of the
 pass. side cabinet. Yes they hung over the edge, but VW stapled a grey vinyl
 pouch to the top of the cab for the ends to stay on. 

============
 I had a 73 westy, which had its childs cot (and rear hatch bug screen and 
westy owners manual etc) and it was kept above the closet, and did not hang 
over the edge.  There was a little vinyl strap with snap I'd clip around it , 
the strap was screwed to the top of the closet cabinet there.

never saw a grey pouch thing.
