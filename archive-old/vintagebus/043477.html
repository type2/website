&gt;If pre-12-volt is where it's at, why do so many people
&gt;convert their 6-volt cars? 

I haven't converted mine!  In fact, since 6 volt is cooler
than 12 volt, I have actually gone a step further and converted
my '64 to *2* volt!  That's right.  I carefully took off the
top of the battery and rewired the three cells in *parallel*
instead of series.  I put flashlight bulbs in the tail-lights.
For the headlights, I run 55W/12V halogens, powered by a
120V-&gt;12V power supply, run on a 2V-&gt;120V inverter.  (The
power supply and inverter are linear and implemented strictly
with tubes and thirty-pound transformers for that &quot;correct&quot;
vintage look.)

The biggest departure from stock I've had to make is in
the wiring harness...a friend of mine down at Power &amp; Light
gets me roll ends of insulated 0000 gauge cable - two
parallel runs of that is just about enough to run the
starter.  It was a lot of work, but I figure what I have
is at least three times as cool as a 6v Bus and more than
six times as cool as a 12v Bus.  So I should be able to
get into the most restrictive shows around...
