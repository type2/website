&gt; Hi all need some help. My VW guy told me I needed to replace the 
&gt; transmissions(?)

Hi Tom,
Transmission is the thing between the engine and wheels!  Does he mean wiper 
shaft s, wiper shaft bearing, or the wiper motor itself?  Check your 1963-67 
VW bus shop manual

&gt; for our 67 (bus) wipers. Where can I get some and can a weekend warrior
&gt; actually replace them??

If you can handle a screwdriver without stabbing yourself, you should do 
fine, but you need to study the manual (our original one has an exploded 
diagram) and have all the replacement parts handy.
