each side)

    056= steering/ignition lock

    139= sealed beams/red lenses

    216= 1500 sp

    This is on what appears to be a '64 Standard Microbus w/ sunroof (no
roof skylights).  DPO has installed a '74-'79 pop-top roof with highly
modified front luggage rack (cut it down so it is only 6&quot;-8&quot; on the
inside front to back).  Also installed is a fairly clean camper interior
(non-westfalia)...

    Bus is Blue white/ Turquoise with como green interior (front seats,
visors, front door panels, cargo door panels, and full partition panel.

Ceiling is wood panel (again, non-westfalia), has a linoleum covered
3/4&quot; fiberboard on floor and carpet covered fiberboard over engine.

    Camper cabinets look like pine with cheap brass corner
reinforcements

        I'm looking at doing some horse trading on this Bus before
Christmas.  Owner is asking $2200, but both rockers are gone, and
doglegs are kinda pinholey( has new replacements for doglegs and one
outer rocker).  Belly pans look okay and it has the under nose panel.

    All hardware for sunroof canvas cover is missing and it wouldn't
take much work to remove funky Westy pop-top (canvas is wasted).


            TIA...
