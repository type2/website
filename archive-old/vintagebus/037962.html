&lt;&lt;  i wouldnt worry about what thes &quot;experts&quot; say, they will make you scared

that you have the engine at 1500 rpm before you engage the clutch&quot;.&gt;&gt;

Hi Chris,
Best you go back and reread that part!  We said it was alright to go below 
1,500 in first or reverse, but best to get above ASAP.

&lt;&lt;you would think after listening to all this crap that driving to work was 
rocket science.  half the beauty of a bus is in its simplicity, lets keep it 
that way. &gt;&gt;

Well this &quot;crap&quot; is from our experience from ACVW driving 20,000+ miles per 
year for the last 12 years.  If one wants to be able to have long engine life 
of reliable 80,000+ instead of only 30,000 or 40,000 miles and best MPG for $ 
savings that will pay for an engine rebuild easily in about 80,000 miles.  As 
for the RPMs we state it that way so others can simply buy or borrow a tach 
and in just a 15 minute drive see where 1,500 &amp; 3,000 RPM are in each forward 
gear at what MPH on the speedo.  While ACVWs were and still are considered 
simplistic transportation, what is really is simplistic is not having to 
repair and rebuild what did not need to be trashed/screwed up in the first 
place.  If you still are unhappy with our info you might just want to trade 
you VW for a horse!  ;-)   Eric&amp;Barb
