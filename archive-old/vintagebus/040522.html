Whoa!  VW garage sales in Utah?  Do you have any more info, or is that some 
kind of inside joke I'm not in on yet?

&gt;&quot;What's in your Garage?&quot; would make a great friday topic.
&gt;Also, with the VW Garage Sales going on in Utah and Florida; how about
&gt;an &quot;International VW Garage Sale Day&quot; so everyone can list the parts they
&gt;want to put on the market.
