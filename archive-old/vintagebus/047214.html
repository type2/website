&lt;&lt; I've got a few gas tanks around that are the old style without the sender. 
 Any reason I can't convert these to use a sender? &gt;&gt;
Hi Rex,
There is a shop technicals bulletin that covers the installation of the 
sender in pre-1961 bus tanks for the accessory gas gauge.  If the bus in 
question is a daily driver you might as well step up to the fifteen gallon 
68-71 bus tank and use the neck off one of your rusty gas tanks.
  If anyone has some rusted through 1955-67 gas tanks sitting around we could 
use two necks.  We hate to chop up perfectly good vintage ones we have.
