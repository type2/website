yes, try pushing in the corner of the wing window as it whistle, if pushing 
the front corner (which makes it seal tighter) makes the whistle go awaty, 
bending the tab out just a tad would make it seal tighter.  which tends to 
make that whistle go away. 

did you replace the rubber?  or is it original?

 Don't our latches get a little tighter just as we're opening them? Something
 like a detent ball that has to rise out of it's detent in order to move?
 Seems to me that Thom's suggestion to tighten the strike tab is one that you
 should not dismiss lightly. Give it a try, you can always bend it back.

 &gt; First let me say thanks for all of the reply 's and
 &gt; suggestions....
 &gt; however, let me explain that the wing windows are in
 &gt; perfect condition and the latches hold the windows
 &gt; very tight, so tight that the whistle gets quieter as
 &gt; I start to unlatch. The rubber is like new and seals
 &gt; great! Still, the noise, the noise
 &gt; &gt;&gt;
