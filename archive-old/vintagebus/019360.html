Subject: antenna suggestions?

I just aquired a Blaupunkt Frankurt radio for the '60 DD panel, and now
I need an antenna for it.  I'd like to get one of the &quot;up the center pillar&quot;
style that has the mount on the roof, like i had on the '55, but I don't 
know where to get one.  The other option would be the &quot;traditional&quot; double-post
mounted over the emblem.  I have safaris, so I can't mount one on the side.
I don't like the spring-base antennas; I had one on the '56, and it ended up 
chipping the paint on the rain gutter.
