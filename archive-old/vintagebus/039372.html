Hey Thom!  Got room in that garage of yours?  Or a back room? :-)
(Ya know, I need one of those APL keyboards from my mainframe days so I 
could use all those nice cryptic characters)

&gt; &gt;BTW, we are possibly going to lose a good So. CA VW shop in the near
&gt; &gt;future.  Got word at Pomona that the owner of Kymco is quitting.
&gt; &gt;Selling the building too.
&gt;
&gt;I thought I read, here or elsewhere, that Kymco was supposed to have
&gt;one of the &quot;big&quot; pieces of equipment for machining cases, which some
&gt;consider superior to the &quot;small&quot; or &quot;portable&quot; equipment that is
&gt;more common.  I don't know the details and I don't want to start
&gt;a flame war about engine rebuilders or methods, but if this is true,
&gt;hopefully another VW place will purchase the equipment...
