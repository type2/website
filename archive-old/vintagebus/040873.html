Kyle writ:

there aren't but a few
&gt;types of conversation on the list. Someone is broke down and looking for
&gt;help, someone just listed a part on eBay, the brawls, obscure little
&gt;restoration details, and mind-numbing reruns of tire sizes, GL-4 tranny
&gt;lube, WalMart toys and 009 flat spots-all of which will be along again
&gt;shortly. Feel free to start them if you wish.
&gt;

How true, how true, pour me another one, Kyle.

OBC: True to form, Rosie took me 350 miles to visit a lady friend and the
clutch cable broke within 1 mile of home. No stops and speed shifted home
without a hitch. Maybe I'll change the cable tomorrow.
