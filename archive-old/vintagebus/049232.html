Was writ that the rear headliner pieces should be easy to replicate by trial and error and using scraps.

Personally I'd say you are being VERY optimistic.  I just finished installing my cargo area *birch* headliner in the '59 subhatch Westy.  I had the originals, although portions were missing due to rot, so I had to assume dimensions in areas.  Even with the patterns, fabrication-to-fit, and installation was no easy task.  I will say there is some play room in the width of the panels, but not much.  To get the proper fit you will need to be well within 1/4&quot; in the correct width to make your life easy, and that's on the high side.  Also keep in mind the panels are not rectangular.  They are actually trapazoidal (sp?).  Maybe that even isn't the right term, it's been 24 years since highschool geometry.  In other words, the rear panel for example is say 54&quot; across at the forward end of that panel, but maybe only 51&quot; across at the rear end of the panel.

I don't want to burst your bubble, but trail and error might drive you crazy.  If I were you I'd sweet talk someone like myself to make paper templates for you, or give you dimensions.  You, and the cat, will appreciate having them.

Robert
