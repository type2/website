&gt;cover on the top of the battery.  Somewhere in the 1965 production year
&gt;(Chassi # 216 190 000) VW introduced a piece of angle sheet metal welded to
&gt;the battery pan that clamped the bottom of the battery on one side and
there
&gt;was another clamp that went on the other side that was bolted down to hold
the
&gt;battery in place.  This later style required a battery that had a step on
both
&gt;lower sides of the battery case for it to be clamped down by.


This is the arrangement I now have in Rosie ('63 Crewcab). Don't know if
it's original, but it fits like it is, and there are no clamps, straps or
brackets over the top of the battery to impede access. Don't forget to put a
battery mat under the battery to prevent further autodigestion.

Live fast, die young, leave a good looking corpse.
Oops, too late!
