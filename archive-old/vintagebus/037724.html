&gt; Rain got ya worried?
&gt; What do you call two consecutive days of rain here in &gt; Seattle? A weekend.

Here in Oregon Two consecutive days without rain is called a drought.

ok bus content and friday topic

took the plung, decided that while two splities is never seems to be enough two 4-Runners is a least one to many. So I sold the 94 and am down to just the 97 and my 67 Westy and 63 single cab, what does that mean, well for the first time in several years i'm back to daily commuting 40 miles in a bus, janelle won't let me near the 97! how was my first day, spent 20 minutes on the side of the road trying to figure out why it was &quot;bucking&quot; turned out to be a very clogged fuel filter, this morning, it snowed the entire way in, gotta replace that fuse in the gas heater.

next topic, i'll be a the spring show in puyallup at the end of april, i know that i promised clara an 8 track player, but can't remember if i'm supposed to bring stuff for others.
