I managed to talk to the owner or someone with him shortly after he
bought it a few years ago.  He WAS selling stuff at a Flea Market,
up here in Grass Valley.  He paid $75 for the bus.

I've also seen it in a section of town I'd rather not hang around.
I saw it in the same section of town at the same establishment.
Probably one of Thom's favorite haunts, thus the SC find.

Oh, and that's the bus I stumbled upon on the day I picked up my '55 SC.
It was sitting at a gas station turned into a recycling center.  This
&quot;citizen of lesser mental faculties&quot; (notice I said &quot;lesser&quot; and not
&quot;reduced&quot; - I doubt he ever had much more than that) yelled at us the whole
time to move the bus; &quot;Dish ish privut propurty, you have to move you van!&quot;
[sic]
over and over and over and over...
