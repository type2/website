What's all this talk about rain?!  We need some good karma here.  Everybody
say five times &quot;It will be sunny and beautiful.&quot;

For those of you who live in the Bay Area you will recall that it always
seems to rain on Saturday but it is always be nice on Sunday for the show.

Besides if it rains it will keep the punk primered lowered bug
playing-bad-rap kids away so more splitties can fit in.

The City of San Jose is only letting us use the one gate again, on the south
side, please spread the word so people don't line up at both gates this year.

I'll be working the gate, be sure to say &quot;hi&quot; I'll be wearing the Split Bus
Club shirt and my trademark Red Sox cap.  If we get the sample newsletters in
time we will have a NEATO booth set up.
