Subject: Proper maintenance of hubcap clips
To: vintagebus &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hi People   This is what I do to insure a long and
healthy hubcap clip life.After checking my oil
level..fan belt tension..valve adjustment..secure
loose gas lines to fuel pump and carb for fire
prevention...oil bath air cleaner level..sparkplug
rubber seals/cable location...engine rubber
seal..engine tin fit.._dot_carb/carbs for little fuel
leaks...heater boxes for fit...cv boots for
drip...transaxel for slip..starter for hot starting
tip...steering wheels two foot drift..clutch cable
adjustment  wont let me shift...43 grease fittings up
front for the grease makers of America bit...I move to
the wheels and check them for shimmys and shakes..and
lug nuts that want to extrocate?...wheel bearings for
lube and fit...brake lines  for blockage that might
send me down a cliff...shocks for loose fittings that
might send a suprize thru your floorboards..I turn my
attention to the overlooked and misunderstood hub cap
clip....Hi Guy's!! How are you today?...I dont worry
about you because of all this other stuff I tossed all
my hubcaps
away!.................................................................................
    Ok.....I am sorry about this.I will never do this
again....I dont know what came over me.To much time
looking thru the &quot;Ark&quot; files I guess.
