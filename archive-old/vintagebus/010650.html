&gt;  I had a problem with underheating my engine (barely over 210, hauling butt
&gt;  over those hills going north from Grant's Pass in the sun...180 and lower
&gt;  the rest of the time).  I'll be installing that oil thermostat I've got 
into
&gt;  the line between the filter and the cooler ASAP!
&gt;  
you have an external oil cooler?  good idea to have a thermostat X junction 
in the oil lines.  seems if your oil temp is under 170F is does not lubricate 
properly.  170-210 is fine, ideal, nifty keeno
