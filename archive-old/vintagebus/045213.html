&lt;&lt; Now that I have gotten so far as to  take the backing plates off to get
them sandblasted and recoated (power  coated? or zinc coated? or POR15?), I
thought why not go the whole way and take care of the rb's too! &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
We suggest taking to your local powder coater.  You will probably have to
degrease your own parts, but most PCers will sand or bead blast your parts
for you.  Also suggest having the parts zinc primered which just a year or
two ago came out for marine use (Salt!) and semi-gloss powder coated by your
local shop.  We had this done to a pile of our old bus backing plates.  At
our local bus club meeting I showed Steve of PLF a finished pair of these
backing plates that we are about to install in another bus tranny of ours.
Steve had some problems talking while in sight of them due to a drool factor
of five.
On a more serious note to your other questions you had better get a copy or
borrow a local friend and his copy of the Bentley reprint of the pre-1968 VW
bus shop manual.   Eric&amp;Barb
