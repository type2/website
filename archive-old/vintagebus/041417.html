I've been through some of this recently so here is what I found with my
58 and 67.  You will need a type2 nosecone and hockeystick.  The ring and
pinion need to be flipped if it is a bug transmission unless you aren't
running reduction boxes.   The gearing in a bug transmission pretty much
sucks, but it will work.  I put a bug trans in my 67 with bignut reduction
boxes and I finish shifting gears by the end of the block.  Ok for my
around town bus, but wouldn't be too good out on the road.  There are
solid mounts that bolt to the original splitcase mount such as Busboys
sell.  If you want one I'll sell it at a reasonable price.  I have two of
these and they didn't work at all well on my 58 but other people have used
them ok.  The other way is to cut out the splitcase mount and weld
in another one.  This is what I did. I made the mount strapped it in with
hose clamps and drove it in to be welded.  On my 67 I learned that the bug
gearing doesn't work that well. I may have the gears changed out
someday.  The 58 has a 3.88 Rancho smallnut from Ronnie.  On that one I
wish first gear was lower, but that thing will fly.  It's kind of scary
driving a 58 bus that fast with stock brakes.    
The bug transmission will get him there, but with reduction boxes, not
too fast.  That can be good sometimes.
