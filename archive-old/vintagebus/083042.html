Subject: Recent Finds

So ... went to see the body man last week - my bus has found a new spot in 
his yard - he says its closer to the door so he can see it ... right!

Anyway - he told me that this new guy working for him told him about a yard 
full of VW's - he said a lot of buses and bugs from the 50's even - right!

So I went to look today - he has a very large yard overgrown with weeds and 
old rotten cars.  I only saw 1 bus ... small rear window with large tail 
lights and a gas gauge so ... 62 I'd guess - rotten bad bad bad - but - 
steering wheel looks like a 7 out of 10 - engine is out and sitting behind 
it - oil bath air cleaner is still attached - rims on the rear - I bought em 
both - he says they are 15&quot; - they sure looked like 15&quot; to me - but not 100% 
sure - when did vw go to 14&quot; rims?

It has a rough 80 to 90% complete Devon interior for a bench seat bus - this 
is a standard - still has the fabric headliner and interior panels of a 
standard - I guess Devon would convert what ever they could get back then - 
it has a metal label affixed to one of the cargo doors that says Devon 
Camperette - or Devon Caravette - or something like that - I'll also try and 
get what I can re: switches and gas gage etc... I bought the interior - it 
is pretty rough and over priced ... but ... not sure if I'll use much of 
it - the bed is in the cargo area - and I like the idea of a z-bed - but it 
does have some pretty nice cabinets that could go in my 60 SO-44 pop-top 
westfakia. Anyone know of any pics on the web of early 60's Devon's?

He has a very nice looking 65 beetle - wow - the interior is amazing for 
such an old car sitting in a junk yard in Ontario - engine is still in - I 
didn't check the numbers - the heater channels seem firm - but the floor 
seems gone.  He says it was sitting in a shed for 20 years and that he 
pulled it out of the shed just a short time before the roof of the shed 
collapsed - he wants $2,500.00 for it - yep - you read that right - he says 
he is going to put it in the iSell for $2,500.00 - I might offer him 
$1,000.00 and just say that if it doesn't sell in the iSell give me a call 
and I'll take it for 1K.  It has a glove compartment full of old paper work 
and original manuals etc.. The body looks very solid - look like original 
fenders etc.. and the car looks totally complete. The interior panels look 
amazing - all the interior needs is a cleaning and seat covers.  It has a 
gas heater and radio.  Anyone know of any VW Beetle Resto shops in Ontario? 
I'd love a 65.

He has a pretty cool Notch back - looks to be beyond hope.

He has a few more beetle shells that he showed me and says he has others but 
he didn't want to show me those - he says they are worse then the two bad 
ones I saw.  I want to explore more around his yard just to see what else 
might be there ... I'm going back next weekend to pull the interior of the 
bus and get the rims - I'll also see what else I can grab.
