Subject: Re: [VB] fuel reserve valve 

How are you getting along with the ex? Any gambling debts? 
Probably a stiffened 40 year old seal that has cracked. Drain the tank, pull the valve and replace the seal and sock. Remove clockwise, maybe somebody made an Armstrong fix the last time it leaked. A penetrant may help.

&gt; So ... damn ... my fuel reserve valve is dripping pretty bad and I'm having a
&gt; tough time getting it off.  Any advice on where this thing would most likely
&gt; be leaking and how best to fix?
