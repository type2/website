Subject: re:tires, i will have the answer
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

i am going to the SEMA show next week, SEMA is the largest automotive parts convention in the world, last year they added the tire retailers show to SEMA, almost every tire manufacturer in the world will have a booth and a lot of the wholesalers will also have a booth, last year i found 6.70X15  6 and 8 ply tires and a couple of other sizes that were close,even found 10 ply tires, the funny part is that most tires in these sizes are manufactured in the US of A for export and don't have the federal DOT, the distributors also told me most of these tires are tube type even tho they are radials, they figure the roads in third world countries must be harsh on tires so they figure the tubes must help, but they also told me that i could run them tubeless with no problem, i will keep the list updated on what i find, i'll be gone from wednesday till friday,
SEMA takes at least 3 to 4 days to go through
and with all the suppliers i talk to it will take 4 days, yes about every parts manufacturer in the world sets up a booth there from bosch to hella to dansk to liestriz  (hope i spelled it right) even VofA should have a booth, volkswagen is getting into the vintage parts business like porsche did in the 80's and wants to start pushing there own line of oem parts, really watch the prices skyrocket on vw parts but maybe more quality parts will become available.
