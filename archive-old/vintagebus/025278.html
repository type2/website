&gt; I was lucky not to have had a disaster when my hose fully failed on me.  And
&gt; my hand brake was in order.        See, I was a dirt hippy back then in my
&gt; younger wilder days (but never into smoking pot) but know better now and keep
&gt; the bus in better order.     A friend of mine who was a potsmoking dirt hippy
&gt; had a 63 bus he rammed into someone when his brakes failed, after my dire
&gt; warnings to fix them, dipsh%t he was, unconnected to the ground off in the
&gt; clouds.  Ya, don't muck around with your safety, your family's and that of
&gt; the people you could run into.

Hey folks,

I'm a young half hippy and I definitely smoke pot ---
but my bus is safe. When I got it, I changed the fuel
lines as stressed on the type2 website and recently
my brakes were getting spongier. I adjusted them but
couldn't open the frozen bleeder valves so I got the
local VW gurus (2 german guys around a 75 years old)
to do it. Some valve in the dual MC (PO mod) was leaking
and letting air in.  Much better now. Wow, I never tought
those busses could brake like that!

I guess I have the coolness of the Hippy without the carelessness...
