Subject: Re: [VB] friday question Greatful Dead song?

hell it a bucket has it pretty close. &quot; i may be going to hell in a bucket
baby, but at least i'm enjoying the ride&quot;

the copy in front of me is on the philly 3/18/95 bootleg, when the wife gets
home with the rest of the cd's i'll see if i can find it on something easier
to get ahold of.



&gt; Looking for a G D song that is named or is in the
&gt; lyrics&quot;but I enjoyed the ride&quot;I would like to know
&gt; what cd it's on ? Thanx for your help, Paul Smith in Texas
