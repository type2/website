Hi Brooks,
That last sentence does not compute!  ;-)
  As for your electrical drain you should try searching for it with a 
voltmeter.  With everything turned off, take out the fuses and check for voltage 
there.  If no drain in that area you will have to work you way back toward the 
battery till you find the problem.
