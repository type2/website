    Just got in from trying to adhere the corners of my interior rubber
seals for my pop-out windows.  Is there a trick to this?  I just tried using
3m Weatherstrip adhesive (black) and made THE HUGEST MESS IN THE WORLD!!!
thank god for goo-gone!  Anybody have a better way of doing this, or a trick
to solve the my corner dilemma?  
    If I take them out and heat them up with a blow dryer, then &quot;sticky&quot;
them into place will that work?
Who knew a rubber seal would bring me to my knees.
