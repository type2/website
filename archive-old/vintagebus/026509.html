I can't believe all of you are dumping on PLF without any evidence of her
actually screwing anyone!!!! ( Jack and Kyle Excluded). Just last week, Thom
halted a thread to stop someone from bashing another listee. This week he even
jumped on this bandwagon to bash PLF!! I know Dawn and I know there must be a
good reason for delay in that ONE order!!!
By doing this, it will only hurt Dawn and make matters worse!!!! Unless you
have personnally been ripped off by her,  which I highly doubt, than I say SHUT
UP!!! PLF has only done very good by me and I hope she continues!!!

            Sincerely, woody

ps. by typing PLF into the subject and then making general negative
statements,it is assumed you are talking about PLF.
