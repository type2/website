&gt; Hey Michel
&gt;
&gt; One thing to keep in mind when you are considering price, especially with
&gt; things like bearings and probably wheel cylinders, is who manufactured
them.
&gt; I've order bearing from California Imports in B.C. and it looked like a
&gt; great price - until I got the bearings.  They were all made in China.  If
&gt; you order from Ronnie you at least have a choice as to whether you want to
&gt; use cheap bearings or not as he stocks bearings from different
&gt; manufacturers.
&gt;
&gt; I've ordered stuff from www.johnsbugshop_dot_com out of Niagara Falls and all
of
&gt; the bearings were either Fag or SKF - I betcha 5 bucks if I had ordered
&gt; those bearings from California Imports they would have been made in China
&gt; crappola.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Wow
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; in the restoration process of my microbus 1960, i dropped the axle beam
on
&gt; &gt; floor, and removed all  brake part (then the surprise, all wheel
cylinder
&gt; &gt; are stuck in rust), now to remove the inner wheel bearing its a hard
think
&gt; &gt; it barely move, i dont have a puller with me, is there any trick to
remove
&gt; &gt; this, in order to get my backplate to be blasted/por-15 ??
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, i was looking around for brake wheel cylinder part, i wonder why
its
&gt; &gt; less expensive to buy in Europe from Custom speed part
&gt; &gt; (http://www.customspeedparts_dot_com/) than any other store in US/Canada ??
&gt; &gt; Its 25 Euro vs 39$ US each cylinder and the shipping is almost the same
&gt; from
&gt; &gt; US or from Europe (to Canada).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Did you know you could buy a new axle beam for about 500 $ shipped there
?
