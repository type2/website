&gt; The trucks I'm talking about are full size haulers and the light assemblies
&gt; have the adjusting screws and drain holes in the same place as buses. These
&gt; trucks were the last Mercs with a 'hood' if that makes any sense. Current
&gt; Mercs have a flat nose where the screen is flush with the bumper. They were
&gt; trucks in the 5 to 10 ton class and there are many still in service here in
&gt; South Africa. I'll see if I can get a current price and maybe a pic or two
&gt; for anyone that may be interested.
&gt;
&gt; Later
&gt;
&gt; Michael

Sounds like a Unimog............
