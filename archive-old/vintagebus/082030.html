Subject: friday fun- &quot;Top 10 Things I have learned shopping for VW's &amp;
  Parts online&quot;

'Cuz it's friday and I am puh-ruzing the online
classifieds and auction listings for VW's &amp; parts as I
always do... Here are some things I have learned over
the past few years from doing this ALOT!:
So drum roll, please

TOP 10 THINGS I HAVE LEARNED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS
OF ON-LINE VW SHOPPING:

10) The phrases &quot;One-of-a-Kind&quot; and &quot;Unique&quot; are
usually BAD things.
9) Avoid sellers who use the following phrases in
their ads: &quot;Bad-ass&quot; &quot;Phat&quot; or &quot;Pimpin&quot;
8) There are MANY interpretations of the word
&quot;running&quot;.
7) If a seller says &quot;They ALL leak that much oil&quot; then
leave, NOW!
6) If a seller says &quot;ALL the baywindows have rust
under the windshield like that&quot; then leave, NOW!
5) Avoid even looking at a bus if the ad has any of
the following words in the title: &quot;Shaggin&quot;, &quot;Hippie&quot;,
or &quot;Surfer&quot; (and I AM a hippie!)
4) To many people, body filler can be described as
&quot;Solid&quot;.
3) The definition of the word &quot;Rare&quot; is apparently 'An
object so crusted or rusty that it is difficult to
distinguish its true function'
2) Alternate definition of the word &quot;Rare&quot; is
'Something that I have many of stacked in my garage
because i cannot use them&quot;
1) If a vehicle is described as needing &quot;TLC&quot;, then
what it really needs is definitely NOT Tender, Loving,
or Caring..it IS BFH and LDW (Big F-ing Hammering and
Lotta Damn Welding)

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
