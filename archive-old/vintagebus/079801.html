Subject: Things to do or see along I-80 and I-94?

Greetings from a new list member. My first post...

I bought a 1964 Kombi on eBay and will be traveling to Ohio on June 26
with my (adventurous) 12 y/o daughter to pick it up. We'll be driving
it home along I-80 to Chicago, then up I-94 back to Fargo, ND. We have
six days, so even in a split bus we should have some time to stop for
fun stuff. I kidded her I had heard of a half-day tour of the
Volkswagen Brake Shoes Through the Years Museum, but she didn't seem
enthused about that one. 

Can anyone along that route suggest some &quot;real&quot; interesting things to
see or do? We have already negotiated a trade of Six Flags for MoFoCo
in Milwaukee, but that's just one day of the six we have. Any help will
be much appreciated.
