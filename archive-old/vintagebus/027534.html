Subject: oil pump - uh-oh

So...
I've been putting my motor back together, pistons &amp; cylinders and heads are
all on.  I just remembered that I bought a new, bigger oil pump and went to
put it on.  Trying to get the old one off, I pried on it with the big screwdriver
and the edge of it broke off.  Basically two of the holes where the bolts go
through have broken off, leaving the circle in the middle and the other side.


What do I do?  Panic?

TIA,
Diana
