&gt;Oh yeah, the color is a green, shade falls in between a Velvet green and &gt;a
Delta green....the passenger seat matches it as well, but it came to me
&gt;missing the driver's seat...

Yeah, I've heard of those (bus with seat missing). I bought a bus that had the
seat AND the stearing wheel missing.  The dude that owned it said that he lost
his ass and didn't know which way to turn.  Man, what a ride..
