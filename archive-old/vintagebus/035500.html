&lt;&lt; I wouldn't get too excited over the use of aircraft aluminum for these.
 It's one of the most easily available sources of suitable tubing. &gt;&gt;

It is rod not tubing.  Tubing is much weaker than rod and I wanted to make my 
extension as strong as possible.

Rant follows...

This is not necessarily directed at the last person to post but after reading 
several responses to my original post I am very curious why so many people 
**WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN MY REPRODUCTION OR TALKED TO ME ABOUT THEM** have so 
much to say about them.  No, 6061 aluminum alone isn't all that exciting.  
But if I had used some crap material and the extension broke on some listee 
at an inopportune moment then there would be some excitement - the negative 
kind.  

It would have been cheaper to make them out of steel and have them 
chromed...but the weight of the steel extension will wear on your transaxle 
over time much the way a heavy set of keys wears on your ignition.  These are 
not &quot;cheapo&quot; reproductions, I tried to make the best part possible.

As far as the price, I have been picking up extensions at swap meets for 
several years trying to collect all the different styles available.  Yes, I 
have even bought one or two for a dollar but for most of them I paid more.  
When I did find one at a swap most had pitted chrome if steel or scratches 
needing polished out if aluminum.  My reproductions need nothing except 
installation.  Also, there isn't a swap meet every weekend and there aren't 
extensions at every swap meet.  Finding one may be difficult and will take a 
while depending on what part of the country you live in.  You can have mine 
within a week of mailing in your check.

Lastly, if you read the original post regarding **extended period of 
under-employment** you would realize &quot;Hey folks, I ain't got no job&quot;  Instead 
of complaining about lazy people on unemployment (which most of us do) why 
not step back and let one of the few trying to improve their situation do it 
without all the comments...especially when you have never seen the part in 
question.

rant mode off.
