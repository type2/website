&gt; Ok folks...
&gt;
&gt; Who or what is aircooled_dot_com?  aircooled_dot_com resolves to 165.227.192.145
&gt; Which, with a web browser, brings up an &quot;account not available&quot; bit..
&gt;

It is www.aircooled_dot_net. Nice site, fairly new business by John Connolly. He
is a regular on the aircooled VW newsgroup on Usenet. It isn't an 009, it is
a SVDA distributor he modifies. Single vacuum, dual advance. He messes with
the spring and counterweights and guarantees a 3-4 mpg increase and a huge
driveability increase. More with a Pertronix. Lot of people on the newsgroup
speak highly of it. He does guarantee satisfaction on everything he sells so
he doesn't sell a lot of the common junk you can get anywhere. No slip in
big bore p/c's, etc. He's pretty heavy on the service after the sale, so if
you have any questions, e-mail him. He'll answer you.
