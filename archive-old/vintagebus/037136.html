 Hi All,
 For some reason when you push the
 horn button on my 62 westy, a loud whirring sound 
 comes out of the steering box. At least it *seems* to
 be coming from the steering box. Don't know where else
 it could be from. Why is there a wire to the steering box anyway?
 The PO removed the original horn and 
 installed an Alstate twin horn on the other side of the bus.
 The iriginal horn wires were still hanging, so I hooked up a bug horn.
 Still No horn. I haven't chased down the wire going to 
 the aftermarket horn yet.  
 Any ideas on that noise?? Very strange.
 Thanks,
 Larry

there is a power wire that runs straighto the horn.  youcan test it with a 
test light to make sure it works.  Then the ground wire runs from the horn up 
through the steering box through the column to the horn button and grounds 
when you press the horn button, which should result in a loud noise from the 
horn.

evidently something not quite right is hooked up under there, perhaps 
investigation would reveal what the horn button is hooked up to- you may find 
a nearly dead horn there.  

either your hot  wire isn't working, your horn is dead, or the ground isn't.

test hot wire first 

your can test the horn by breifly hooking a batteyr charger to it.

removing the horn and cleaning in the steering wheel with sandpapr helps, 
sometimes it is needed to disconect the horn button and disassemble it and 
clean the grounding metal parts in there to get a good circuit. carefully 
prey back one or 2 of the tabs on the chrome ring and let the poieces fall 
out- make sure all is shiny where metal goes together in ground circuit.
