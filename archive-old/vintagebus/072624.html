Subject: Re: [VB] speedo vs. tire size

I have no clue how accurate my speedo is.  It can't be wildly off.
--------------------- Clip --------------------------
Sure it can be wildly off.
Think about it!
It's the first thing that goes wrong.
I had five speedometers in my 83 Westy in 8 years.
I started out at 145K and sold the Westy with 320,000 miles on it and
only 68,000 showing on the speedometer.
I was honest about the miles since it didn't make any difference (With
all the new parts) and Car Fax said 68,000 miles was the correct mileage
and it had never been inspected in a county that reported mileage to the
state.
Car Fax is a great fantasy.
My 92 Narc Car Crown Vic wasn't ever registered since it belonged to the
DEA ............. We're the government we don't need no stinking license
plates. 
Must be an extension of the US mint, making plates for Government cars so
they never get State registration.
