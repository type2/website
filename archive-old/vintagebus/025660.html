Subject: overheating &quot;H&quot; block
Message-ID: &lt;37849BBA.C2874BDB_at_physics.salford.ac_dot_uk&gt;

My new bus has a late &quot;H&quot; block 1500 in it (engine number indicates
early bay). I fitted a Gene Berg &quot;idiot stick&quot;,
the one which goes in the dip stick hole and flickers the oil light on
when the oil temp is around 226 F.

The bus is on late bay window IRS and so the engine is running around
300-500 less rpm. At a constant 60mph
though the &quot;idiot stick&quot; starts to flicker, it goes out at 50-55 but
must be close to coming on. oh and 60mph = 3,500 rpm with this setup.

I pulled the engine and found that the oil cooler (none dog-house style)
was clogged externally with greasy dirt, so I though I found the
problem, I pulled the cooler, cleaned it and made sure it was clear
inside as well - it had little effect to the temp,
although I recon I can get another 5mph now before the light flickers
on.

So the question is, do carb and/or distributor make a massive difference
to ignition advance, I mean is it possible to have a distributor which
is advancing too much and causing the extra temperature, maybe cause by
the wrong dizzy or the wrong carb producing too much vacuum.  The
genuine 64 edition workshop manual talks about relly quite different
vacuum advance units with quite different advance curves, but I don't
have any information on early bay (late H block) engines
