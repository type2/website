The continuing adventurers of our hero or "stuck in Colinga"

The 61 kombi needed at best a tune up and at worst to be put out of its
misery. So with his tools in hawaii our hero works on his bus with
borrowed tools in borrowed driveways...
not good
With a phone call to our Louisiana techno buddy and his spitfire latina
wife (see our hero's saga the bay window days) our hero had plan but no
clue.
For all you SF bay area bus freaks out there; our hero recommends state
route 25 south of holister to the pinnacles campground for a bus camp
out. The road was put there by God for the express purpose of driving
vintage busses over it. All dips and curves and hills with intermittent
4th to 3rd  to 4th shifts and no traffic to worry about.
Our hero took 25 to its terminus and headed east to colinga. ( Not as
much fun  excepting one later incident )
The clutch needed to be replaced. "No problem" thought our intrepid bus
tweaker "duck soup, done it a half a dozen times once in the rain out
doors." While he had the engine out "better check the generator" he
thought. His good buddy had a sideline with rebuilding the like for
heavy duty equipment. After much heating and penetrating oil and yes
even paraffin wax, much to the sarcastic glee of the techno buddy, the
generator sat over night.
The front end was to prove vastly more challenging. the drivers side
spindle threads were all buggered up and not even reverse threads as
they should have been. The nuts were right handed and on inspection were
so wompus that they were unserviceable. The seals were out and the break
shoe linings were contaminated.
While our hero waited for the ride to fresno to get the proper nuts, he
continued with his inspection of the bus. The front-end was degunked and
given a once over with the grease gun. The break lines were flushed and
bleed only after the drivers side line was replaced by a auto zone
generic unit and the master cylinders tin reservoir was replaced with
the plastic one that had been purchased because of the pinhole in the
tin one. The reservoir swap is a blot in :-)
The next day they took the nuts off of the back of the generator and cut
notches in them with the hack saw to use a screwdriver and backed out
the face plate enough to put in a collar between it and the pulley and
used the press to remove the pulley. After which the coil poles were
removed from the housing to reveal the fried on the inside coils. A
committee was formed and the vote put up for our hero to get a new
generator. The consensus was a unanimous yea polling.
The fresno trip yielded a brand spanking new generator but no spindle
nuts.
Back trashing away out hero discovered that the reserve petcock was
leaking.
He took it off and drained the gas. On disassembly the unit's reserve
unit had a plugged passage. To our hero's chagrin he was unable to
reconnoiter the situation and the passage remained clogged. Can anyone
tell our hero why there are three holes on the parimater of the pad and
one in the middle? Two on the outside and one in the middle seems a more
likely scenario.
The next trip into Fresno yielded a couple of nuts that were to wide and
those were cut down and put on the rethreaded spindle. The spindle  was
done by  his techno buddy; rethreded with a die borrowed from work.
With the bus washed, our hero and his clothes washed and he headed out
over the ridge to 101 north. The view of the stars on that moon less
light put  his later difficultys, a failed battery even with a replaced
generator and regulator and a clogged fuel line, into their proper
perspective.
And as our hero sets and writes this to you, he beloved kombi along side
of the road somewhere north of blood alley and south of san jose, he
charges up his battery and thinks of one of his poems as it relates to
the night before.

The receding greatness of the sky
becomes atmosphere from where i lie
and the whole earth becomes a planet
made of gaseous soup and granite
and as i recline the whole world levitates
spinning in time towards heavens gates
and the big things in my life are small
because its a wonder i am at all.

with apologies to the halebop art bell crowd ( our hero was there first
)
aloha
