<< Hello Frank, Cheryl, Calvin and Dan & Family.  I just wanted to 
 drop you guys a line and let you know how things are going here.  I 
 also would like to request, if it's not too much trouble, that you 
 post my message here to the list so everyone knows how things are 
 going. I think Frank can take care of the vintagvw list and Dan can 
 take care of posting to the vintagebus listserv.
 
 Sometime Thursday evening or Friday morning was when I made my last 
 post to the list.  Since that time, the phone company has arrived 
 and removed the 2nd line which we had for over 13 years for nothing 
 but dedicated computer use.  I ran a BBS on this line for 4 years 
 in the early 90's until the computer crashed and that ended things 
 for the "Imperial Realm BBS." :-)  Anyway, I was a bit miffed that 
 they sent a guy out to our house because I had called and asked if 
 they needed to send someone out.  I was assured that *EVERYTHING* 
 would be handled at the phone company and there was no need to have 
 anyone here because nobody would be sent out.  Whatever.
 
 Friday mid-morning I had to make a delivery to my ISP and I got the 
 word that we had in fact been converted to DSL that morning.  I 
 figured this weekend would be the DSL change over period.  It has 
 been but we still aren't done.  As you've probably guessed, the 
 fact I'm having to send this via web mail is clue enough that we 
 aren't out of the woods yet.
 
 Moving along and getting to VW content.  The bus had started just 
 fine for Glen and I Thursday evening but after that first start, it 
 refused to start subsequent times.  Lights were dim, starter would 
 clunk and then things would fall off.  The charger showed the 
 battery was holding a full charge but it no longer would deliver 
 the current to crank the bus over.  I decided that Saturday morning 
 I would put in the battery that I use to test fire engines on the 
 stand.  After installation, the bus fired right up and ran great so 
 a bad battery was the cause of my problems.  The alternator seems 
 to react better to the new battery - charging a lot better than 
 before.  A look at the old battery showed that early 1997 was when 
 it was purchased and beings it was a cheapy - it's no surprise.
 
 Friday evening, I had ran over to my grandfather's the night before 
 to help him try to start his 1949 Chevy Carryall (predecessor to 
 the Suburban).  We kind of got it running off of starting fluid but 
 the carb wasn't delivering fuel properly or even at all so we gave 
 up and decided to pull one off one of the other engines and rebuild 
 it later.  I asked my grandfather if he wanted to ride with me in 
 the bus to the Steele City, NE flea market but he declined stating 
 that he wanted to work on the Carryall.
 
 Saturday was day 1 of 2 of big Steele City, NE flea market and swap 
 meet.  I got a call from my grandmother Saturday morning asking 
 when I was leaving because my grandfather wanted to go.  Grandma 
 said that night he laid in bed and said, "Boy I sure wish I could 
 go with Erin to Steele City."  Grandma said, "Well Wendall, why 
 don't you?  The work will still be here when you get back."  So 
 after making a run to the bank and fueling up, we headed out on our 
 25 mile or so run to Steele City.
 
 Steele City is a dying town - the school is nothing more than a 
 historical site - being shut down in the mid to late 80s for 
 consolidation.  The trains still run through every 20 minutes with 
 100 car coal loads instead of passenger cars.  The people of Steele 
 City are of strong character and drive though.  They've pulled what 
 few of them are left - together, and renovated old buildings for 
 historical preservation, maintained a humble park, and the Salty 
 Dog tavern is a jam packed locale almost every evening of the 
 week.  It's a favourite of Harley riders as one can stop almost 
 anytime around the weekends and see Harleys and their riders from 
 all over the U.S. as the license plates and helmets will tell you.
 
 I like general swap meets because chances are good when you find 
 anything VW, the people will either not know what it's worth or 
 what it is and charge accordingly.  The bus ran great on the way 
 there - bucking a headwind at 65mph required floored pedal but we 
 made it!  Oil temps with 60F outside were a steady 150F.  After we 
 rolled up and parked, it was literally about 5 minutes at the first 
 vendor's tool table that I spied a 13mm/8mm Hazet wrench in really 
 good shape.  The bucket was labeled, "Misc. Tools 50 Cents Ea."  
 The wrench became mine.
 
 The rest of the day didn't net me any more VW stuff.  There just 
 wasn't any.  I did buy some trinkets and some gift stuff but 
 nothing major. I think I only spent about $7.00 total.  For lunch 
 we ate at the Salty Dog since none of the charity benefit lunches 
 there were anything we wanted to support.  You could get a rib 
 sandwich and chips for $3.00 plus your drink so I ordered 2 
 specials for myself and one for my grandfather.  He paid for it all 
 as well so that was nice.
 
 I spent the rest of the afternoon watching the old time saw mill 
 cut up 20 foot Cottonwood logs with blades that were in excess of 3 
 feet across!  Amazing!  The old way of doing things was hard but 
 with a team of devoted people, the work got done.  Today (Sunday) 
 they are going to put on an old time grain thrashing demonstration 
 at 2:30.  It's really awesome to see that old farm machinery work 
 and you can't help but think how hard your ancestors worked to make 
 a living.  Another good plus to watching grain thrashing is that 
 old timers can tell you how in about a half an hour, a handful of 
 wheat kernals can be turned into impromptu chewing gum.
 
 About 3:30, we headed for the bus.  I walked by a vendor that had 
 new tools for sale and I bought 2 BBQ lighers for $2.00 - that's 
 cheap and cheap insurance against burning yourself - they make a 
 great way to start torches and propane open-eye heaters so you 
 don't have to ogle your heater (with match in hand) and jump back 
 before the WHUMP catches you and singes your eyelashes off.  
 Anyway, we walked towards the bus and I passed one more table.  
 Laying there in admidst heavy farm hand tools was a white over red 
 plastic auto compass which looked 50's retro.  It kind of worked 
 but regardless, I figured it would look neat in the bus.  It came 
 with a little bracket and a screw hole in it so it's now mounted 
 securely to the one of the airbox screws.  It even matches the 
 color scheme of the bus! :-)
 
 We got back home around 4:00 and after dropped my grandfather off, 
 I came home and crashed.  About 2 hours later, my friend Greg who 
 is the sysadmin at BeatriceNE_dot_com stopped by and slaved for about 4 
 and half hours trying to get DSL to work.  He tried the P166 and 
 that culminated in a reinstallation of windows (Like I expected.) 
 and a crashed machine so he'll have to look at it on Monday.  The 
 installation on my brother's computer (Celeron 400MHz) worked great 
 but we couldn't connect to the server.  Greg took the Cisco router 
 home, tested it (passed with flying colors), and brought it back 
 here and it flopped again.  So the only thing Greg can figure is 
 that something is misconfigured at HQ in Lincoln.  We'll know 
 Monday or Tuesday if I'm DSL enabled or not.  In the meantime I'm 
 still able to read list traffic but I can't post to it because the 
 webmail header is slightly different and the listserves won't 
 accept my posts.  
 
 A few things I need to say before closing:
 
 Glen Hadley - thanks immensely for the help on Thursday.  I can't 
 get to your phone numbers because they are on my crashed machine.  
 Call me at 402-228-2462.  You left your fanny pack in the bus and 
 eagle eye Dad found 4 sockets in the gutter in the street that you 
 missed.  Everything is here until you tell me what to do with it.
 
 For the Nebraska and Kansas contingents, Pink Newell and Rick 
 Taylor are heading up to Indian Cave State Park in Southeast, NE to 
 scope it out for a fall campout.  VW Buses of all years will be 
 welcomed to attend the event once we have definite plans but if you 
 have any other VW or even a passing interest in seeing a sample of 
 what BNNTA was like, come on down - we won't turn you away.  I'm 
 sure Shawn and Sarah Hunt will be there (great Bus Volk!) and if 
 Isaiah can make it, I'm sure he'd give it a try too although it's 
 quite a long drive for him.  Anyway, if anyone is intersted in the 
 Fall campout wherever we have it (somewhere in IA, NE, KS, MO area, 
 feel free to get in touch with me, Rob, Terry, Pink, Rick, etc.  
 We'll have something cooking within the next couple of weeks.
 
 That's it for now - sorry for the long post but a lot has gone on 
 and I'm sure some of you were wondering where the heck I was at.
