	I will have to agree with Mr. Lyle on this point. Bob Hoover is more
than capable of self-defense. George is also right about the p-mail
issue. I think this may have to do with the fact that the List Website
is undergoing renovation and the protocol for things around here may not
be clear enough to everyone.
	By "protocol" I mean that anyone with a question or problem is supposed
to go through the Archives, Reference and Busted Bus sections, and their
personal manual(s) first. If they find no answer to their question, then
they are directed to post the question to the list server, where
everyone can read their post and answer to them, either by list or
p-mail. I believe p-mailing Bob Hoover is considered a very serious
thing, a "last-resort" reserved for the ultimate unsolvable problem that
the List can't offer a solution to, a very rare thing indeed... IMHO.
This was stressed by the information on the Website.
	Since we have been going through some radical list server changes,
perhaps this essential information has not been given to anyone who is
new. I don't know about that, myself, but I'm several times guilty of
violating the order of things and p-mailing him first. When one panics,
sometimes these things happen. But he promptly replied to me, answering
my questions even though I hadn't obeyed the rules. The gruffness factor
was pretty low, though.
	On here, protocol is protocol, period. If someone has a "simple"
question it certainly shouldn't be sent to Bob's e-mail address at all.
The confusion here is that... well, consider this: in the days of yore,
when I was new to VWs and working on them, what I now call a "simple"
problem WAS a major emergency to me. It was a matter of priorities and
experience. It wasn't my fault for thinking it was an emergency. I just
didn't have the perspective that I do now. It's kind of like 2001: A
Space Odyssey... While we're all standing before this strange monolith
that we don't understand, some of us start picking up discarded bones
and using them as weapons... tools, IMHO. Some of us haven't gotten to
that level yet. Some of us use fewer, or smaller bones than the others.
	It's not that anyone is inferior/superior... (we all started out in
this world with zero technical knowledge!) it's just that not all of us
are on the same technical level at the same time, and certain ground
rules must be adhered to in order to promote List Harmony. Bob Hoover
is, at the very least, *one* of the people in this virtual neighborhood
who knows a heck of a lot about VWs, but if (I assume) he gets too many
requests for knowledge dispensation at the same time (especially those
that the List could answer) then the ol' femur-bone comes out a swingin'
and somebody ends up with their ego bruised. 
	Add this with the fact that Bob Hoover is *not* Emily Post's twin
brother. He's an Navy man, a mechanic of many years with a thick skin to
match the time. 
	Now if all this sounds like I'm kissing Bob's arse, think again. I
respect his knowledge and experience and I think that you can take most
of what he says to The Bank. In spite of that, I have found that he can
be downright inconsiderate for others' feelings sometimes... just what
I've noticed in several public list-posts and one in particular that was
directed to me as far as the flame part of it went. After I read it I
felt completely humiliated, and that in front of the whole List... He
was right about what he said, but he selected an unduly harsh way to say
it. I wanted to flame him something fierce for it, but I had to go get
the facts from people in the post-discussed profession. They were in
agreement with Bob, which I found not surprising although disappointing.
	I'm not angry with Bob Hoover at all. I just respect him in a guarded
kind of way. I'm grateful for what I have learned from him and the time
he has spent composing long, detail-oriented e-mails to me explaining
the more technical aspects of what is done to VW engines to produce a
standard of quality, and I will probably never be able to repay that
debt, except by passing on the information. But, I can't expect anyone
who has been slapped in the virtual "face" to be thankful.
	So I have mixed feelings here. I'm glad that Bob has gifted the List
(and me) with his cornucopia of insight, but I have reservations about
*anyone* who is rude to other people on repeated occasions, without
apologizing. Before everyone starts throwing stones, here, let me add
that I'm not perfect, either. I have my bad days where something goes
wrong or not at all... and sometimes that gets taken out on other
people. Sometimes my intolerance of other people's intolerance or
lacking-of-manners becomes vehement to the point that I become as
abrasive (if not moreso?) as the other person was, like the other day
with the Copyright Thread....
	But I think it's seldom, IMHO.
	Given a bit of leeway here, I'll say that quirky behavior is sometimes
the mark of a genius. knowhutImean, Vern? and... I think Bob's the List
Guru, a genius in these parts, and will sometimes make profane
utterances that befuddle us for a while... and we don't know exactly
why. 
	To sum up this lengthy communique`... 

A: follow the protocol and we're all happier.
B: realize the Yin & Yang of Hoover... take the good with the
not-as-good and don't let it bother you too much. What he has to say
otherwise is more than worthwhile, and eclipses IMHO the rest. He may
have some terrible problem to deal with that we don't even know about
and may be the root of discomfort, even if it is merely the curse of
genius. 
C: Read yer Bentley. memorize passages. spread the word.
D: "Drive it hard! Fix what breaks!" (per Lou Naumann, a German mechanic
in Knoxville, TN) (nothing beats having someone with a Real German
Accent teach you how to work on your bus!)
E: Why can't we all just get along? 
F: Realize that this list is awesome, with *everyone* who is here. There
is no other place on the Internet that is this cool or has the good
people like we do, IMHO!
G: "Everybody, just love eachother and pick up a little garbage on the
way out and everything's gonna be alright!" John Sebastian, Woodstock
Music Festival....
H: "My God, it's full of stars!" 2001: A Space Odyssey...
I: Time for lunch...
