   <h1>Trip report BBB V (long)</h1>
   <b>&quot;Wade's-Wagen's&quot; &lt;wades_wagens_at_uswest_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2001-01-26 12:26:37+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Arrived at the caravan spot to see Everett had his DC all ripped apart in
pieces. Fortunately he was only switchin oil bath aircleaners. Waited for a
bit and Matt and Katie showed up. Very kool people, never met them before.
Another 2 guys (cant remember their names) showed up in a late 60's DC as
well. Dan howard wimped out and hid from me a few days before it was time to
go, so I never did find out his deal and why he didn't go. Shawn and Earl
decided they weren't gonna drive with us and went a different "shorter" way.
Shawn ended up having one of his tires blow out, and didnt have a spare. I
think every bus that was with us did have one tho =) But ah well he ended up
makin it up anyway. Left the meeting spot around 11:30.
    Everything went smoothly until my SC started cuttin out. Stopped and saw
that the fuel filter was clogged with rust. A quick change out and we were
on our way.  Met up with Greg noble at Quartzsite and he joined up in the
caravan. Once at the show we promptly met NQ and Rob laffoon who were
wandering around admiring buses. Saw Rachel but never did get to speak with
her. Clara was missed by me as I was wanting to meet her, but I plan to go
to Buses by the Balloons (when is it?) so maybe then. Show was great, Got to
hear some terrible Karaoke, Saw a non-show participant rabble rouser get
arrested, and watched a "unnamed" prominent listee (code named Fire B!tch)
Light his spare gas tank on fire after pouring it on a un-lit fire and
accidentally leaving a trail from the fire to his can which was placed about
10 feet away. Match was lit and thrown on the fire, followed by a 8 foot
ring of fire hell, and Evv - I mean Fire B!tch stompin on his tank and
dousin it with dirt lol.
Got to go check out my Barndoor, and found out it has a running 1952 25hp
engine in it!!! I could sell that and pay for the resto heheh
    Quite a few deals at the swaps altho the real good stuff seemed to be
mostly "psst hey so-and-so, come here and check this secret goodie out that
i wanna sell you but noone else" type of thing. I picked up a few small
parts from Everett but not much else since I was broke.
  I actually convinced (forced) Everett and Greg to drink a few beers. A few
barndoors were in attendance and tons of other splits, although somehow I
failed to see the (6?) double door panels that were supposed to be there?
Gabe gave me a killer deal and keyed all my locks the same. Somehow my
ignition wires which I left disconnected all night (since gabe was doin the
ignition) ended up drainin the battery. Went to jump start it and the
battery was screwed up and so was the regulator. Wont go into details for
fear of self incrimination (yah i screwed everything up) but I got to get
towed across the lot by the westfailure V8. Ever see a splitty shoot rocks
and dirt onto your windshield as you were being towed? =) Kyle my unofficial
Godfather came to my rescue once again and gave me a battery to drive home
on knowing that my charging system would not be refilling it. Darkness was
nearing and we headed out , with Everett in his DC taking lead, and Earl in
his SC following behind.  Wish I would've got a pic -   3 trucks, one with
hoops and canvas, the other 2 with hoops, rollin thru the desert.
 It was dusk and I was still cruisin with no headlights. Look up to see a
cop cruise by in the opposite direction. Flip on the lights and continue on.
Few minutes later I look back and notice Earl is nowhere to be seen. Stop at
the next gas station to fill up and here he comes, cop right behind him. I
guess the cop pulled him over (Earl had one taillight out) . The cop said "
I see you turned your headlights on"... Earl responded sayin that it was in
fact the truck (me) in front of him. The cop responded "What?? the vehicle
in front of you was a WINEBAGO!!!"  lol (refering to my tilt/canopy setup).
  Cop followed him to the gas station where we were, cause he didn't believe
Earl that I was *not* a winebago....Cop didn't give a ticket but said I
needed to drive with at least one headlight even thought it was still
illegal.....
Rest of the trip home was uneventful except for the 4 different vehicles
that tried to kill us, but the battery lasted the whole way home, thanks
Kyle!
 Another killer show put on by Ronnie and the LBB!
