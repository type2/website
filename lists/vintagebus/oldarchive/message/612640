   <h1>Trip REPORT- WA to AZ, didnt need those toes anyway.(Long)</h1>
   <b>&quot;LilBlauWagen&quot; &lt;wades_wagens_at_qwest_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2004-02-11 10:21:01+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Well my friend had money burning a hole in his pocket and I had been asking him when he was going to
be a proud bus owner over the past 6 months or so, so he finally took the plunge. He knew nothing of
buses, but had become addicted the first time he road in my Binz. He hysterically laughed the entire
ride. The blinkers went on and he busted out laughing. I shifted a gear and he busted out laughing.
Everything about the bus he thought was quirky and funny, said he felt like he was riding in a tank.
At the end of the ride his only response was "I want one." After that, all his working hours were
spent on the internet and drawing up buses on the bus selecta. After he was serious about buying, of
course he coulnt find anything he wanted, so he flew us up to WA on the drop of a dime as soon as he
saw the add for his "perfect bus".

We flew up to spokane washington saturday morning and got there around 11am. Right off the bat
things went downhill. Delta airlines had lost my suitcase. You know, the one that was crammed full
of nothing except tons of tools? the one we needed to make it from WA back to AZ with an unknown
bus? The one with my winter coat, the flashlight, the ground tarp, the sockets, the wrenches etc?
Sat around at the airport waiting for the next flight which didnt come until 4:30 that afternoon.
Still no luggage. Did you know they never scan those tags that they attach to your suitcase? Only
gets scanned if it goes unclaimed, and they dont scan it when they load it on the plane. Which means
i dont know if it even ever got in the plane or if its in germany right now. Decided to leave the
airport with the seller and went to walmart to buy supplies (tools etc). $200 later in Stanley
tools, and 3 pairs of socks (which were of no help, damn idaho weather)a jacket and etc, we were
off. My friend loved the truck so we took off in it. It was a 61 sc with safaris, straight axle rear
with bug tranny,1776 w/kadrons, drop spindles, Newly recovered humpback seat, etc. He drove it
around the block and said that was the bus he wanted, despite all the things i mentioned wrong with
it (He plans to have me fix everything if you know what i mean). the owner then began pulling the
license plates off. Great, have to drive across 3 or 4 states with no plates?? We took off and not
too long into the trip i realized this truck was as bouncy as a trampoline. No shocks underneath,
heh this should be fun!. We made our way thru idaho late on schedule. Snow began and the temp
dropped rapidly. We got off the highway on "a shortcut" the locals pointed out on the map, and
headed down on a backroad in the direction of Idaho falls thru our virtual hell on earth as it would
soon become to be called.
    We soon found ourselves on some mountain range climbing up and down hills at 20 mph sliding all
over the road, a place where snowplows never bother to go and the snow was pouring down. not a car
in sight. 4 hours later we made it out of the mountain drive onto some lower flatter roads when we
saw the "deer ahead" sign. And thats when it began. An elk shot out from the road straight towards
the side of the bus and just skimmed past the back of the bumper. I slowed down to about 10mph and
was just putting along the road. Elk were everywhere jumping out and running alongside of us then
randomly darting out cutting me off and forcing me to brake and steer to the opposite side of the
road. I looked back and saw about 6 or 7 of em just hangin out in the road behind us in the
moonlight. If it werent -3000 degress outside i woulda climbed out and got the camera out. Damn it
was so cold.
    The next morning we were out on some idaho highway, and the wind was blowing the snow so hard
across the road, looked like a solid white fog across the road.  I was running about 45 while
everyone else flew by at 80-90mph. Went under a bridge and when i came out the otherside i was
fishtailing 4 or 5 times, fighting it. Finally went around 180 and slid off the road into a
bottomless snow pit that divides the highways. something tells me the low profile tires werent snow
friendly. Looked around to see 6 or 7 other cars slid off the road as well with the owners talkin on
phones so we held tight waiting for help to arrive. A two tone bay window owner rolled by, didnt
smile, wave, or flip us off. Just cruised on by slow,  looking at us with a straight face. Gotta
love those fat chicks.
Cop shows up and ask us where were from and where we are going and finishes the questions with "So
how much DOPE does she have in er'???" I say "Uhhh none?" and he laughs and says "suuuuuree" and
drives away. He goes to all the other cars and talks to them and in the meantime the tow truck had
showed up. the cop pulls up again and tells the truck driver "Be sure to  pull this truck out of the
snow first, cause we need to get all the dope out of there!!!" Then the two tow drivers and the cops
bust up laughing.... wtf?? the cop takes off again and we hand the tow driver a 50 and just take
off. That idaho cop seemed like he was already high, he didnt need more (no we didnt have any). Damn
it was so cold. We hit up a Walmart and bought one of those propane heaters. I think that actually
saved my life that weekend. It did light my shoe on fire and part of my pants after laying on it
trying to sleep, But it was sure worth it.
    Later that night we got off the interstate in search of a Denny's and we took a wrong turn into
a parking lot. My friend was driving and the carb linkage was a little sticky for some reason (the
owner had it rigged up as well). Anyway he came to a super steep drive and tapped the gas and it
revved up and shot him down the drive and BAM heard a lound bang that didnt sound friendly. we made
our way over to Denny's and go to get out..but we cant. Turns out there were only one bolt in each
side of the bumper brackets and the impact had pushed the bumper so the ends were up and blocking
both doors! So were stuck in the bus trying to get out, and my friend starts trying to convince me
to go head first out of the safari- hell no! It was soooo damn cold at this point i was rapidly
considering it. The people in Denny's just stared out the window even though my friend was waving
for them to come and help us. Nobody dared come out there. a group of guys pulled up and pushed the
bumper down. My friend spent the next 30 minutes diggin snow out from under it in the wet parking
lot trying to remove the bumper. Luckily there was no damage. How do you people live in the snow?
Blows my mind.
    There was some serious celebration going on when we left idaho. Dont think ill ever step foot
back in that state. Going thru Utah was  pretty uneventful and not as cold, but we did get pulled
over on the way out. Cop wanted to know why we didnt have plates. He also asked me what kind of
vehicle it was. Obviously you utah guys dont drive your buses enough!  He did let us go, but not
without threats of impounding it and etc. Lost a grey hubcap in Utah on the interstate. So keep an
eye out in your travels thru there =) At a local gas station i pulled up and a drifter was standing
there and said "Hey! that used to be a german car!" I questioned him about the usage of the words
"used to be" and  he replied" Yah it used to be german, before you lowered it!" Haha cool way of
looking at it i suppose. Im not much for lowered buses anyway. After he was done talkin shit, he
walked off and as we drove out, there he was thumbin for a ride! hah nope.
    Once we hit AZ it was smooth sailing and the roads were all smooth, what a difference! Speed
kicked up to 75 no problem, safaris  wide open, jackets came off. What a different world! I find it
funny that absolutely nothing went wrong with the bus (besides the fact that every control in the
cabin was adjusted wrong, clutch, brakes, steering, etc) but that everything else possible went
wrong! Oh yah, noticed it has mcode 362, and it was not a 12v bus and does not have seatbelt
mounting points. So looks like there is more then one meaning for 362 as well.
All in all it was about 1700 miles / 47 hours to drive home which was about double what we had
planned.. Some guy near my friends house already wants to buy the truck, but i doubt he'll sell it
after his recent experience. He definetely got jumped into the hobby on that one!
Heres a pic of him with his new purchase:
