   <pre>Hi All,

I write this with damaged pride and ego...


Yesterday morning, I awoke, excited with the prospect of going up to Tacoma
to pick up my new 64 SO9 cherry picker.  The comments from all of you on the
list regarding what plates to put on it still dancing in my head and the
anticipation to get the thing home, get it running well and then present it
to my wife on her birthday, the 19th of this month.  I arranged an alibi
with a friend of mine up in the TriCities WA in that I needed to go up there
and help him with a software project he was in the middle of (actually a
true situation so it made it all the more realistic to my wife.  This gave
me the opportunity to leave the house at 5:30, go over to Roy's shop (my
friend with the trailer), park the NB and then off we went.  The drive was
un eventful and we made great time.  Arrived in Seattle a little before 11
am, paid the shipping lines their $100, made it to customs before noon.
They had no issues and signed off on it.  Went over to the USDA to pay the
steam cleaning bill (this is a complete scam mind you... but that's another
story) and then went and had a quick bite to eat since it was during the
noon hour and the union workers at the warehouse were all on break.  We
arrived at the warehouse, I go in and I'm immediately bombarded with
questions and comments about my new *toy*.  Last year when I went to pick up
my tipper at the same location, all the guy could ask me was "why" but this
time, these guys were quite jealous of the v80.  I sign the paperwork and we
pull into the warehouse to load it onto the trailer.  I asked the guy if it
started since before it was put on the boat Bob at BBT said the battery kept
going dead which the guy replied that they had to jump start it when they
drove it outside for the steam cleaning.  So, we didn't even try to start
it, picked it up with the forklift, set it on the trailer and then chained
it down.  One chain across the front bumper brackets (keep this in mind) and
one chain over the rear end of it through the structure of the lift.  I then
remembered a story from Bob that the boom is not secured too well so we
strapped down the bucket and away we went.  Ten miles from the docks, we
stop to check things out and turning off the highway, it was a little rough.
I noticed that the bucket had slipped out of its little cradle so out came
another strap and we fully secured the boom and bucket, and away we went
again.  Things were going very well and people on the highway were staring
at this funky orange VW in tow.  I was all smiles.

Since everything had gone so well, we made it home around 8pm.  My kids were
at grandmas (my wife had left around noon for a conference and returns
Sunday night) and they all weren't expecting me until 9 or 10 so I called
and told them I would arrive in about an hour.  We had backed the trailer up
to one of the bays at Roys shop so we opened the big door so we could see
and started to assess better just what we had on the trailer.  This thing is
sooooo cool.  The dash is perfect (33k km on the odometer), the seats have
come unstitched but other than that nothing was found way out of order.  Roy
does hydraulics for a living so he was checking out all the plumbing.  Bob
told me that the boom went up and down but it didn't rotate.  One
anticipation I had was to get the thing driving and the little rotating blue
light on top working and then drive it in a parade we will have here on
Monday for Veterans day.  Realize that as a running joke in my house hold
for the past year or so is that if I were to ever get a v80, my wife wanted
to ride in the bucket in a parade.  This was my opportunity to put some
'happy birthday' sign on it, and then have a friend drag her down to the
parade and I surprise her with it.  It all seem doable, feasible, and
perfect.

So, here we were with an extra hour on our hands.  We had opened a few beers
and continued to inspect things.  At one point, I decided to jump up in the
cab and see if it would start and if the blue light worked.  I really didn't
think it would since the guy said they had to jump it.  I twisted the key
and to our surprised ears, the engine sprang to life.  I pulled the knob and
jumped out of the cab and saw the blue light on and turning round and round.
Smiles were everywhere.  Well, since the engine was running (remember, it's
still strapped on the trailer) we decide to see the boom work.  We unhooked
the two straps holding the main boom down and I climb into the bucket.  I
don't know German....  so I start pressing buttons.  The boom never goes up
but the end extensions swings up and down.  I keep pressing buttons while
Roy checks out the solenoid valves and what not.  Still the only thing that
works is the end extension part which goes up and down but it doesn't rotate
nor the main boom go up.  No oil is spewing out.  I look down and note that
the out riggers on the rear have extended down as they hung over the edge of
the trailer.  Things don't register and we continue to mess around  but some
of the buttons when pressed, you can hear the motor being pulled down and
there's some creaking noises.  Things still don't register.  Finally, we
call it quits and I hop out of the bucket.  We talk about the fact that the
rear outriggers are fully extended and then our focus goes to the front
outriggers and then it hits me like several tons of bricks.  My heart sinks
below the soles of my shoes and I stare with disbelief......</pre>
