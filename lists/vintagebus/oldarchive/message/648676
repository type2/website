   <h1>Operation: Bullet Binz  (long)</h1>
   <b>&quot;LilBlauWagen&quot; &lt;wades_wagens_at_qwest_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2002-07-23 12:34:12+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>
I recently was contacted by the owner of a 58 Binz, who had owned it for the
last 20 years. He had the same last name as me so i knew right away that it
was meant to happen!   It has been sitting in a field shrouded by trees on
his property. I nicknamed it the 'Bullet Binz', because some hunters found
it on his property and decided it would be cool to shoot out all of the
windows and one of the headlight assemblys. The owner had then moved it to
his new property to protect it and had lost interest as he had about 20 or
30 other non-VW projects lined up. He also said he had some other late 50's
ghias on his other property and the vandal bastard hunters had jumped on the
roofs and caved them in. Supposedly nobody knew about this binz and it was
secret, But if you went to church you couldve spotted a glimpse of where it
was hiding due to the location of the church on the hill............

The owner is still over hitchiking around Spain somewhere so it was hard to
get ahold of him but i finally did and we struck a deal. I drove non stop
from Phx AZ to Hermiston Or.  this last weekend to get the Binz. 44 hours
round trip non stop. the binz turned out to be #181, a very early june of
58. There was a problem with one of the hinges on the suicide door (the
lower pin sheared), so he had removed the door and stuck it on the back Binz
seat. So fortunately that rare glass piece didnt not get damaged by bullets
and I recently found someone who had sold their binz but kept the same rare
glass piece for the other side, so I bought it and now I have both binz rear
side logoed glass and all I have to do is find the normal bus front door,
and windshield glass. There was also a problem with the decklid hinges and
the decklid had been stuck in the bed upside down, which wrecked the paint
from moisture, but preserved the Dealership sticker where it came from!
WINTER MOTOR CO.VOLKSWAGEN  Pendleton Or. For the most the paint is nice
original dove blau, but since Binz sucks at painting, alot of it is cracked,
peeling or has just plain worn down to the metal from sitting in the sun for
so many years. Pitty, i was going to try and buff it out but there isnt much
paint left on the roof.

It is all still 6 volt. There was a 36hp bus engine complete but all
dissasembled, sitting in the bed. I checked the numbers and it is a bus
engine, but numbers are 4 months off of the VIN of my binz. Engine is a Late
october 58 whereas my binz is an early June 58. I have the Oregon title from
1973  which shows it titled off of the original motor which is 4 months
earlier number. The rear Binz cardboard headliner was hanging straight down
(disconnected from the back, but still attached to the center strip) and you
could see where the bullets had gone thru the windshield, thru the
headliner, then out the back window. The only place where the hunters missed
their targets, was where they hit the body a couple of times on the piller
right behind the front drivers door. Im still looking for the bullets
although i have only found a couple of shell casings. I count 3 bullet holes
in the body, 5 bullet holes in the passenger windshield glass ( the rest of
the windows are shot out so i dont know how many bullets went thru that) 3
bullet dents in the body and one bullet I assume, used to shoot out the
headlight assembly. The truck had plastic air scoops at one time but were
long gone leaving nothing but plastic remnants still screwed to the body.
the gates are in VERY nice condition, even the back gate. The bed was filled
with 30 years of piles of "stuff" and so i havent gone thru all that ( i
could see some of it and it did look straight), because when i got there i
saw that the dash was INFESTED with hornets! They had climbed into the
speaker grille, and made nests hanging down from the underside of the
grill( and I later found there is nests in every location possible) Needless
to say i didnt get to inspect much of the interior at the time. All seats
there including the binz rear seat, all interior panels still there, rubber
mat still there for the front, quick check under the mat on both sides, no
holes - ok good - run away fast and wait 3 minutes to go back etc.  Speaking
of the dash, it is nice and uncut. Has a saphire 1 with a dual post
antannae. all wheel wells looked good not counting all the hornets nests
that were built in all 4 of em. Doglegs were perfect. The passenger rocker
was rusty with a hole and that appears to be the worst of the rust, anything
else i have seen has just been surface rust. I was looking under the binz
rear seat when i noticed what looked like some kind of tube coming out of
the bulkhead behind the front seat. I flipped up the front seat and wahlaa-
a Gas heater installed down in the spot where you would put the spare! Cool
a bonus. Has both front and rear ribbed bumpers although the rear bumper was
cut for peashooters and had some towing hitch welded to it. The binz has
been in oregon since at least 1968 and i know of only 2 owners. Last
registered in 78 and still has the oregon plates on it. Piles of 1978
Pendleton OR newspapers in the bed. Judging from the info i have, it looks
like it was sold in 73 to a guy, then he sold it in 79 to the second owner
which i bought it from. Never left Oregon. I will probably be able to trace
ownership back to the original owner and find out more about how it came to
be. Anyway everything seemed to be in order so I loaded it up as the hornets
tried to attack me. I had an electric winch so i stood back and pulled it up
on the trailer and drove away. Seemed like a huge swarm of hornets followed
me because i stopped at the first gas station down the road and there they
were again flying all around the cab while i attempted to secure the binz
and remove the headliner from the center headliner strip. Needless to say
that took a while. I opened up the passenger door and the upper hinge
squeaked. This seemed to piss off the hornets and they attacked the hinge.
It was covered. I got in and drove away. Each gas station i stopped at, i
performed the standard drill. Get out and run away. Then sneak back over
with a small object of some sort, and toss it at the dashboard, then jump
back in my tow truck and drive away. After 4 or 5 stops i managed to clean
out the hornets......Or so i think. I may wake up tommorow with a garage
full of the nasty little bastards after they hatch from all the nests they
have stashed in every corner of the truck. I stopped counting.

In idaho at about 1 am we came upon some stopped traffic on the on the I84
right before the I15.We sat for about 20 minutes and decided to walk up to
the accident. There we found a Semi that had rolled and was laying across
the highway blocking every lane. Cab was all the way out to the barbwire in
the ditch. Emergency vehicles blocking the median ditch. No way past, no
turning around. Busted out the digi cam and hung out there taking pics for
about 3 hours waiting for them to pull the semi off the road. I got to
talking with one of the guys involved. He was towing his new 2002 CBR
motorcycle in a Uhaul small box trailer and wondered why  a couple of people
had put on there emergency lights and pulled over a little ways up ahead. He
figured it was a just a breakdown or something until he realized there was a
huge black 20 feet tall, 60 feet long object that seemed to span across the
entire road. He rubs his eyes..was he dreaming? oh sh*t hes not dreaming,
lock up the brakes and come to a screeching halt at the rear axle of the
semi and sort of bounces back from hitting the tires. Ah good he made it...
or did he? what about anyone behind hi- oh sh*t too late! 3 guys driving
another pickup truck full blast BAM right into the back of him. Never even
saw it coming. were they sleeping? No fatalities except for the cargo in the
semi which was spread all over the highway, dont even know what it was. And
of course the new motorcycle paid the price, Its now scrap metal. the 2
women driving the semi had fallen asleep. 5 minutes earlier and we may have
slammed into it with the binz. Makes you think back to all the "delays"
earlier in the day that you went thru, and wonder which one made the
difference.

On the way home I saw a rainbow in flagstaff AZ, got in a position where i
actually could see it hit the ground. No gold and no leprechauns. Someone
told me they mustve been hiding but i dont think so...... unless they can
burrow.</pre>
