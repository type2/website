   <h1>The Turkis Turd goes to Detroit, Pt. 2</h1>
   <b>&quot;Brian M. Wittling&quot; &lt;kdfmotors_at_primary_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1999-06-17 22:56:34+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>So Sunday, the day of the show, I am awakened bright and early by the sound
of Woody's 64 Kombi being fired up to transport him, Crusty and Matt off to
the show to scam up on the early-bird swap meet deals.   It must have been
around 6AM or so, and raining, so I just slithered back down into the bed
and went back to sleep.  I didn't wake back up until Dawn's mom came
knocking on the bus to get me up, saying it was about 9am already!  (I still
hadn't figured out I was in a different time zone I think).  We hastily
broke camp, and pulled out of Pontiac lake about 9:45ish, with Chris Walsh
in the lead.

Chris did his best to lead us through the myriad of detours, but got us lost
anyway, and in a not so good looking part of town.  Grosse Point, it was
not.  Luckily, someone else headed to the show had seen us turn off the
route, and stopped to help get us back on track.  By the time we got to the
show, it was nearly 11AM. And the sun had come out and the temperature risen
dramatically...  I was dying in my sweater and long pants!  I was charged
like a buck or something to get in, and did my best to get into the show.
Man, it was crowded!  And there was no one around to direct us to where we
were supposed to park, or help guide us through the crowds. I crept along
through the crowd, which was very slow to get the hell out of my way, with
the dog freaking at some other dogs he was spotting, and me sweating like
hog.

I finally found me a spot respectably far enough away from the night-club
volumed country music that was playing over the PA system, however we were
packed so close together in the parking lot, I was so close to a late model
Ghia that I almost couldn't open my cargo doors!  On the other side of me
was about the ugliest late-model bus I've ever seen in my life.  The Ghia
next to me though, was just an ordinary late-model Ghia, about a 73 or 74
maybe, with a fresh Maaco Late model Ghia green paint job.  Like I've never
seen one of those before.  <grin>  Anyway, I proceed to get out of the bus,
and get the dog on the leash, when I notice the owner of the car watching me
rather intently.... She seems rather nervous.  I proceed to set up the
Missouri Micros banner on the side of my bus, and set up the German flag I
fly on a wooden dowel rod from the roof rack.  The Ghia woman is totally
spazzing about this time.  She asks me if the dog is going to jump on her
precious Ghia and scratch it.. and the BEST part was when the wind caught
the German flag and blew it in the direction of her car...  leaning the
wooden dowel flag pole in the direction of the precious gem...  the woman
let out an audible gasp!  As if a 3 foot long wooden dowel would harm her
paint, and as if a little scratch on a green late model Ghia would be such a
travesty to begin with!

I was greeted right away by Paul and Lisa, and his sister Michelle, whom I
have know for a few years now from the MOFOCO shows, and our own Octoberfest
camp-outs.  Paul was there with the whole family - his 2 kids whose names I
can't remember, in the VERY rusty but trusty velvet green '67 Westy he
drives.  Paul's Westy was just seen on TV in the show "Early Edition"  in
which they had painted it yellow for with some sort of water-soluble paint.
>>From there, I made my way through the swap-area, with dog in tow, to try and
score a few things for my VW's.  I'm still searching for a door-cabinet for
my SO-33 Westy, and the large dinning table for said Westy, and a Sahara
Beige radio block-off plate for my '67 bug... oh, I also am still missing
the "P" style church key for my bus! None of which was to be found at this
swap...  for this big a show, I thought the swap was really quite lame.

Once back to the bus, I had discovered the Ghia lady had left... oh well,
it's probably better that way.  I tied up the dog to the side of the bus,
and set off with the cam-corder.  One of the 1st people I ran into was Jaime
Rivers, from that country up north where things are a lot more expensive.
We caught up an things since 'Everybus' and walked about the show together.
I also ran into another guy from that country up north were they sell ham as
'bacon' that I knew from Busses on the Blue Ridge.  And, other than Pat
Hoffman from St. Louis, I really didn't see anyone else there that I
knew....  OHHH...  lets not forget though the chance meeting between I and
"Big Earl" of Splitzine fame.  You're right Cletus, know Big Earl is a
life-changing experience.

The cars there were pretty darned kewl.  There was a lot of awesome stuff
that you never get to see in the shows around St. Louis.  There was more
split-oval Beetles there than you can shake a crank-start handle at.  I even
got to see a Kubelwagen and Schwimwagen in person for the 1st time in my
life! There was also a lot of busses I hadn't seen before, including a few
flip-seat campers.  The concession stand also was selling the biggest Polish
Sausages on bun that I've ever seen in my life.  But man o man, did it get
hot and sunny that day!  Temps were in the high 90's according to the
thermometer in the bus, and I also walked away with a hell of a sunburn on
my neck and the tops of my feet.   The mini-museum in the headquarters was
pretty darned kewl,  with that Telefunken bus in there, and an early Westy
in pristine condition.  There was also a '43 KdF Wagen in there just like
Dick Christensens, only in worse shape <grin>, the hood badge on the bug in
the museum is Dick's reproduction!   One other thing I really enjoyed about
the show was the very low stink-foot count in attendance!</pre>
