   <h1>Rosie Gots (Long) Legs (a VERY LONG trip report in multiple parts)</h1>
   <b>&quot;C.R. Sauls&quot; &lt;crsauls_at_mail.telis_dot_org&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1999-06-14 21:38:05+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Chapter 1) In which our hero and his favorite transporter set out for the
Southland to attend the OCTO meet and VW Classic.

    Packed all the tools and supplies I could justify into Rosie on Friday
morning for a trip to Fresno to pick up Harry Houck and Karl (aka Mario,
more on that later) von Salzen. A lovely summer morning in the Great Central
Valley, but freeway construction forced a 10 mile detour on surface streets.
No matter, we're on an adventure and have plenty of time.
    Rosie is purring like a kitten, strong and oh so willing, just the way
you always thought it should be. Now onto the freeway, accelerate quickly up
to 70, rolling right along with traffic. As we motor southward, with air
temps in the low 80's, the oil temp settles in at about 180. She's running
good and cool, so we pick up the tempo a little. Now cruising 70-75,
paranoia forces us to watch the overpasses and mirrors more closely. Even
though traffic is moving as fast or faster, Rosie's bright color and unique
appearance will attract unwanted attention if we're not careful. The drive
is mostly uneventful, so my mind begins to wander to the upcoming events.
Unfamiliar with Karl or his bay Westie, I hope that he is capable of
maintaining reasonable speed, since we have 250 miles to travel from Fresno
to Anaheim, our first night's destination. I would soon find that my fears
were unfounded.
    Arrived at Harry's house ahead of schedule, about 1:30 pm. Karl would
not be off work until 3:00, so we killed some time cruising in Harry's
electric Thing, checking out some web sites and the like. Karl showed up
about 3:00, direct from work. He needed to go home, clean-up, and gather his
wits. Told us to come by about 4:00. "Lovely", I think to myself, "we
probably won't hit the road 'til 5:00." Killed a little more time, then
drove to Karl's about 3:45. He was ready! Harry decided to ride with Karl in
his '74 Westie. We hit the road within 10 minutes of arriving  and I had to
scramble to stay with him through town to the freeway.
    Karl was three or four cars ahead of me as we merged onto the freeway.
Traffic was moderately heavy, but in an instant he was gone. I was traveling
75-80, not keeping up, but too paranoid to go any faster. I soon discovered
that at 75, the oil temp would hold at 190-200, but at 76, it would start to
climb and quickly reach 220-230. "She's not broken in for these speeds yet"
I says to myself. Four or five miles down the road, I spot Karl pulled over
at a ramp, waiting for me. We hooked back up, and settled into a steady
70-75, with short bursts to 80, then slowing a little to let my oil temp
drop back, which it does very quickly when I slow below 75. This becomes the
pattern all the way to Bakersfield, with a single gas stop.
    As we pass through Bakersfield, air temps are now in the 90's, not hot,
but warm nonetheless. As we roll towards the Grapevine, I toy with higher
speeds, allowing the oil temp to reach 230, then slowing to cool, figuring
short bursts at higher speeds will wear in the cylinders at the upper limit
of the piston travel. I seem to be able to travel a little faster without
the temp starting to climb, but I am obviously still holding Karl back.
    Then came the Grapevine. For those of you not familiar, it is called the
Grapevine because of the way the road winds back and forth, to reduce the
steepness of the grade. As we hit the bottom of the grade, we are doing
about 75 and the oil temp is about 210. A short distance up the hill, Karl
is losing speed, and drops to 3rd gear. Those Westie kits are heavy.
Suddenly Rosie comes on. She and I roll up the grade, 4th gear and 65 mph,
"Cruisin' up that Grapevine hill, passin' cars like they were standin'
still". Then, to my shock and disbelief, the oil temp starts to drop! We're
climbing a hill with signs warning drivers to "Avoid Overheating, Turn Off
Air Conditioning", with a little accelerator still available, and the oil
temp drops below 180! I'm beginning to question the instrumentation, but
she's just too strong for me to worry much. I stop at the top, and wait for
Karl and Harry. I soon realize this was a mistake. A splitty is just too
light and jumpy on the road at high speed to keep up with a heavy bay Westie
going down hill. I quickly learn to catch up and pass on the uphills, then
do my best to keep up on the downhills. I am also nervous because the drum
brakes are less than impressive at these speeds on a steep downhill.
    We continue in this fashion over the Tehachapis and down into the San
Fernando Valley. Even though it is somewhat cool, the air is very thick and
rich. We take the 210 east towards Pasadena to avoid the traffic snarls on
I5 through LA proper. Just east of Pasadena, we stop for gas. As we leave,
searching for an on-ramp, Karl suddenly turns right into a residential
neighborhood. We stop. Broken throttle cable and neither one of us has a
spare. At least we broke down in a (very) nice neighborhood instead of
Compton or East LA. Karl exercises his mechanical creativity, and splices
the cable together with a barrel bolt from the heater. Less than half an
hour lost, and we are back looking for the elusive on-ramp. Once we find it,
the remainder of the drive in the ever-increasing darkness is uneventful. We
arrive in Anaheim about 8:00, check into our motel, and wander down the road
for some dinner and brews.

That's more than enough for now, jeez can I ramble on. More later if the
mood strikes me.
