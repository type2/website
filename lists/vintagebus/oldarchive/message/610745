   <h1>LEAF Festival trip report...</h1>
   <b>Jason Black &lt;vwbus_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2000-05-28 08:00:12+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>    The LEAF Festival was pretty cool....
    arrived Thursday night about 1 or 1:30 in the wee AM hour... but
there were a few people stationed at the main gate to check me in,
etc... so i drove up to the upper camping areas.
    it was kind of a neat vibe... with only the volunteers being there,
that is. there was a nice fire in the pit and maybe 20 people hanging
out around... some drumming going on. a good thing. a baywindow or two
down the hill... i drummed a while and (being used to going to bed _at_
6:00 AM) easily outlasted everyone else at the fire pit...
    I stayed up too late and had too much refreshment... woke up about 9
on a hot friday AM... blah. so i made some coffee and changed and went
walking around looking for some people I thought were coming. walked and
walked and walked... walked some more. they have over 600 acres there so
they are not short on walking space. had to go by the red school bus and
get a double expresso in a cup of coffee... <shiver>.... ;)
    I found noone i knew but met a lot of nice people... took a nap and
went down to work one of my volunteer shifts... 8-midnite at the
cafeteria. but business was slow and so i was let go.... with all this
newfound free time i went walking some more... up the road and down the
road, through the campsite areas... still didn't see anyone familiar.
    sunburns are familiar though... mental note to get some sunscreen.
    well that wasn't exactly true... i met one of the gates' keepers who
i recognized from the '70 Westy that pulled in and whose Beetle tube
burbles roused me from my slumber.
    He and his girlfriend have a neat bus... it has two sets of intake
ducts.. the lower set being cut from a wrecked donor bus, so i hear... a
PO fab, too.
    Herman Bodkin... a la Nashville VW Scene, built their motor... wild,
how life is interconnected like that. I met Herman more than a few times
down at the local VWFLAPS in Nashville...
     anyways... I walked around some more around the scene. listened to
the band a while... got a slice of pizza and some lemonade and cruised
up to one of the Halls to watch the contra dancing.. i have always been
impressed by the coordination that is required to contra dance. about
that time i was detained by a fetching young lass for the next dance...
I protested that I could not dance, but my pleas were ignored... but it
wasn't too bad, for my first time contra dancing. I tried it a couple
more times with different women, but the dances kept getting harder to
remember and i know for a fact that i enraged a lot of experienced
couples on the floor by messing up the routine... ah well... I headed
back up to the camping spot.
    about this time a thunderous noise that was the drum circle started
filtering through the trees.... i grabbed my drum and a couple of
refreshments and headed down the hill...
    it was a good circle... lots of experienced drummers... i.e. it was
hard for me to keep up with them ;)
    maybe 3 or 4 in the AM, the circle ended... and another one started
up on the top of the hill, but it was not IMHO excessively loud....
    woke up again about 9 on saturday... more coffee... went over and
inspected the quadruple-scoop bus. ended up being videotaped concerning
type2_dot_com.. hadda mention (since their bus kind of acted like it was
going to die when they were parking it...) the article about air and
throttle shafts and so on... good reading. I am going to send them the
link and some other info and maybe be on Nashville local access TV...
yikes.
    walked around more... a lot more... walked around more slowly this
time. again, met a lot of cool people. went by the Mandala Massage booth
in the center of the venue area and got a 20 minute seated massage..
buck a minute. aside from some tension in the lower back area, checked
out okay... i feel better, anyways...
    walked back up to the site and shot the bull for a while with my
neighbor... realizing then that i had to be back down at the cafeteria
to work at 6:00... run, run... whew. after slicing a box's worth of
tomatoes up and washing all of the kitchen stuff from dinner, it was
about 10:00...  I was glad to do the work, especially because it got the
rest of the diesel motor oil residue off of my hands and nails, which is
hard to control seeing as how I exist in volumes upon volumes of it
every working day...
    While i was washing dishes... i had some help. the first was from a
guy with:
http://www.virtualtravelers_dot_com/
    the short explanation i think is that they drive their bus (this one
was a '70... i think they have a couple of different ones...) around,
sponsored by people who buy advertising on the bus' panels.... great
idea, IMHO ;) ... but I plan to spend some time on their website and see
what it's about.
    the other help was from Kai Lin (sp?...)... she didn't say a whole
lot, but she was a lot of help...
    So my LEAF tank was about full... i can work my job until the fall
without another festival and be okay with it..
    i was waiting for a sign to decide my course of action... and just
about then one of my other neighbors returned from a wedding she had to
go to... so i just left her my spot and came back early... got stuff to
do.

later....
