   <h1>O4-11-00 Bus Progress Update</h1>
   <b>&quot;No Quarter&quot; &lt;silent_at_beatricene_dot_com&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2000-04-12 00:17:38+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>In the past 2 days, I've taken a great step forwards in this bus project.

Yesterday evening I was able to install the brake pedal and weld up the
fatigue crack in the stop.  I also braced it up with an additional tab but
my welding skills not only sucked, they sucked even worse when I welded
upside down.  Now I kind of have a stop tab with a ball of gumball welds on
the backside.  Oh well - it's all POR15'd now and the belly pan will hide my
amatuerish welding job.

I had to buy a welding bottle earlier in the day and nobody had the little
bottle in stock that I wanted except the welding supply store that had
ripped me off last year and really left a bad taste in my mouth.  The story
was that I turned in my bottle last summer and 6 months later, I was still
getting bills and threats of collections so I had to call the head office
long distance in Salina, KS to iron out my problems.  This was the 3rd in a
series of incidents and last summer was the last straw.  When I spoke with
Gene (the new manager of the store for 6 weeks) initially over the phone, I
related my story to him.  He apologized and told me stop by in the afternoon
and he'd have a bottle fixed up for me.  I visited with him and he told me
of how when he took over, he found checks 3 months old that hadn't been
cashed amongst other paperwork that was allowed to accumulate.  Gene has
really had to pick up the pieces left by the last numskull.  He apologized
for the gross oversight despite it not being his fault - he backed up his
words with a discount on the bottle and giving me free gas.  I told him that
was enough to convince me to do business with them again - I left on good
terms sealed with handshake.

I placed my first order with Bus Boys last week and my order showed up
today.  I ordered the $10 tool that aligns your torsion springs and rented
the swing lever bushing tools.  I gotta say that the tools are AWESOME and
the directions for using them SUCK!  It's just a bunch of photocopied
stuff - some pages look like homemade blueprints and others are hand drawn
diagrams.
The type-written instructions aren't too bad but they are written for a tool
which is slightly different than the one they sent me.  The instructions
refer to a "gold sleeve" on the tool.  I spent about 10 minutes looking for
a gold sleeve.  Finally I just set the directions aside, studied the tool
over, and proceeded to use it with absolutely no problem to remove and
install the center bushings.  I would venture to say or at least suggest,
that Bus Boys should allow someone free rental of these tools in exchange
for a top-notch rewrite with photos.  The rest of the installation wasn't
too bad.  The directions said to run the reamer up to the top bushing and if
the center pin doesn't go in, keep reaming - and ream I did.  I still
couldn't get that swing pin to go into the top bushing.  Finally on a whim,
I ran the reamer down through the top bushing and bingo - the center pin
went right through and man what a nice snug fit.  Absolutely NO slop at all!
The Bus Boys directions didn't say anything about this either.  One more
point of constructive criticism about the Buys Boys tools and directions -
they refer to certain key pieces on the tool as the "large top hats" because
that is what they look like.  For someone familiar with tools such as I, I
can manage to figure stuff out but I think they should stamp the individual
pieces of the tool parts with some kind of identifying marks and then refer
to the parts via these stampings in the directions.  I'm almost positive
that Bus Boys must get frequent calls about this tool on how to use it.  But
enough of this - I'm still grateful to have received the tool in good time
and my order was taken totally over the net via email and shipped promptly
(as in immediately!) so overall, my first transaction with them is a GOOD
one!

I finished the night by treating some areas under the bus with POR15 that
were affected by the welding, installing the torsion leaves in the beam as
well as the gizmos that slip over the ends of the torsions.  Bus Boys sold
me a tool for $10 that aligns the leaves up.  It's like a beam centersection
cut out.  I used it to scrape off a lot of the old grease.  As for putting
the leaves in the beam - that took quite a while.  I finally figured out
that installing them all at once is close to impossible so I did a
progressive install.  I slid about 3 leaves in, wiggled the torsions around
and then one by one, the rest of the leaves went in - their ends spaced
apart by a few inches each.  Once they were all in, I just flushed the ends
and tightend the grub screw.  Next I slid those suspension pieces into the
beam and over the torsions (I forget the name of these parts.)  Due to a
back order, I won't see grease seals for this area until the end of the week
so I'm kind of at a stand-still on the beam.  I think I'll start installing
brake stuff on the backing plates and put the new ATE M/C from Ronnie in.

That wrapped up my evening.  It was 11:30 when I quit so cleaned shop,
washed up, went inside and had some chocolate cake and iced tea as well as a
nice 15 minute visit with Grandma (80 years old and she was still up!).</pre>
