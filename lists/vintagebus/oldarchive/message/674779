   <h1>'59 Kombi...1st trip report (long)!</h1>
   <b>rexrogers_at_type2guy_dot_com</b><br/>
   <i>2001-12-10 20:20:59+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>It finally happened. Made my first trip in my '59 Kombi!

The Austin Aircoolers had a campout planned for this past weekend in Elgin, 
TX, at Vintagebus Listmember Greg Silkensons's land.

Me and the wife have our 7th year wedding anniversary coming up in a few 
days, so she kindly planned to have our kids tended to for the weekend. 
That left the 2 of us for the trip. Yee Haw!!!! We headed out Saturday 
morning and took our time on the trip...did we really have a choice? We 
stopped every at least once an hour to visit junk shops in small towns 
along the way. We spent about 6 hours to go 250 miles.

As we neared Austin we started to see water puddles around. Apparently a 
front had moved in just below our travel route. The cold and rain kinda 
came in unexpected as the forecast had called for nice weather in the 60's. 
Oh well. We got to Greg's place and he told us that there were still some 
VW folks coming for the campout. They all showed up about 10 minutes after 
we got there. Everyone brought food and beer and so we all ate well. They 
started a big bonfire. And to really get it going through in an old T1 
engine case. It eventually started to burn an intense white glow. Very 
cool. Another vintagebus listmember, Craig K, showed up a little later in 
his bus with half of an old 36hp case in his hand. He through that in the 
fire and it really burned! I guess I was easily amused after killing a 
6-pack of Guiness. I got to check out Greg's "other" single-cab and ended 
up getting some parts I bought from him a year or so ago! All in all it was 
lots of fun.

Me and the wife got up early Sunday morning and headed out for our trip 
back. The weather was much nicer and we decided to try a different route 
towards home. On the way I quickly spotted a mid-60's Single Cab pickup 
sitting with a lot of other old work equipment in a field. Wow! The last 
registration was from '87. The truck was pretty worn and torn...but very 
complete. Basically just looked like it'd been used REAL good. It had a set 
of extremely straight deluxe bus bumpers in the bed as well. I asked around 
the neighbors and finally got a name and "in-town" address for the guy. I 
took some pictures and left it at that for now. I'll eventually hunt the 
guy down and try to buy it. I'm a sucker for single cabs!

We headed back down the highway stopping in towns again as we went. Man 
it's amazing how many people smile, wave, give you thumbs up, and all that 
on the road. Everytime we stopped someone would talk to us about the bus. 
As we got farther down the road I spotted a '60ish Kombi sitting in a 
field...again along with tons of old farm/ranch equipment. I found a 
farmboy driving a tractor and he told me I should talk to his dad about it. 
He told me there were more of 'em and pointed me to the right direction. 
Said I could go look at 'em while he fetched his dad. I grabbed my wife's 
camara again and went to take a look. The first Kombi was the one I saw 
from the road. Bullet turn signals, small round taillights....still there 
and not cracked! In fact, the bus was really complete and very straight. 
Just all rusty looking from sitting in the field. No cancer...just that 
oxidized look. Big thing was no transaxle or front beam. I'm sure they 
yanked those to make a hunting buggy. I ended up finding 3 other splitties. 
One was somewhat on it's side. But it was a '60ish one and still had all 
the parts and some good glass. No running gear. Another was a later 60's 
bus missing the engine. It was pretty darn rough and would be good but for 
yanking parts. The last was the funny one. It WAS a hard top deluxe, early 
60's, corner windows as I remember. The front was hacked off and the whole 
bottom was hacked out. It was basically the sides and back from above the 
floor and up. It was welded to a square steel frame and was, I was told, 
gonna be a deer blind! Amazing. Oh well. It still had all the glass and a 
lot of it was cracked. The kid told me that's why it never got finishe. All 
of the beltline trim was there and in good condition. All of the jailbars 
around the windows were there as well. I also spotted an old bug carcass 
with the glass taillights and a few other goodies still in good condition 
and left on it. I talked to the old man and he said he'd have to talk to 
his uncle and mom as the kinda owned the stuff as well. I mentioned $100 
for the bus up front and parts off the others and he seemed to think that 
might work. I'm supposed to call him back in a week or so. Like I said, I 
got pictures of all of 'em as well as the single cab...but they are on a 
"regular" camara so I gotta get 'em developed and then scan them. But I 
will post them along with a few other pictures from the trip.</pre>
