   <pre>Wow, this is the most FUN I have had on the list for quite sometime. There 
are several great ideas mentioned.

First, it has been mentioned or implied by several listees out there. There 
are different schools of thought regarding how to own our buses and as 
mentioned that's what makes this hobby/business interesting to such a diverse 
crowd. That's great! Some want to drive it to death only to rubber band it 
back together and drive it to death again. Others want to restore their bus 
to the better than new condition. I personally prefer the better than new 
ownership thought. However, I do drive a decent/restored by a PO, 66 21 
window, daily. I am criticized by friends outside the car crowd that I 
restore cars to work of art status but drive a junker. Well, I have 12 
junkers now, give me a few years, I have big plans for each.
Second, I agree that a better system, other than people choice, must be 
established to judge restored buses at shows. Concours is a good idea. I deal 
with many car guys, old timers, that have seen cars evolve from just 
transportation, to collector status. They know which Duesenberg is the best 
in the world, who owns it and how much it sold for. You name the car, they 
know which one is the best.    
90% of the best cars are restored. How many of you know which 58 ghia 
convertible, barndoor 23 window or 62 23 window walkthru is the best. Just 
because it was featured in Hot VW's or the owner or the restoration shop that 
restored the car says it's the best does not mean #$%^. Volkswagens (not just 
buses) need to reach this level and the only way to get there is to judge one 
against another.
As mentioned, Porsche and Mercedes do have original parts available over the 
counter at the dealership. This definitely leads to customer loyalty. I can't 
tell you the number of times that I heard from owners of VW dealerships they 
were ordered by Volkswagen to throw away the old inventory. This, as far a I 
am concerned was the biggest mistake VW ever made and quickly led to the 70's 
decline of VW's market share, only to begin to recover just recently. If VW 
remanufactures parts, it will only be due to the demand for quality restored 
cars that the car collectors want. Hence the need for establishing which 62 
23 window is the best in the world. There will always be someone trying to 
restore or find one better, that's what leads to remanufactured parts and 
continued interest from people outside the VW crowd.
Third, daily drivers are just that. The daily reminder to average Joe 
commuter that there is another way of life out there, besides that Japanese 
rice burner that is trying to look like Mercedes latest offering. These daily 
drivers keep the public aware, promote the hobby and hopefully inspire the 
average Joe to BUY one himself. Go ahead drive it. Who knows, with a concours 
system established at a VW show similar to Monterey, your daily driver might 
become your retirement plan. The value of your VW may go up because a similar 
bus won and then sold for mondo $$ after the show. However, as mentioned in a 
previous post, in a concours class the DD owner should be prepared for 
disappointment, unless they are using the system to learn what needs 
attention to better their ride.
Fourth, go head keep hacking. I learned a long time ago that I can't own or 
restore them all, so go ahead do what you want to do. But bear the following 
in mind. There are collectors that want the best, your hack job may be what 
the collector compares the best to. I advise potential buyers/collectors all 
the problems with a vehicle before giving consent to purchase a car. Take the 
rare 23 window double door that was at the Classic and recent Pomona. I had 
three potential buyers at the show that day looking for the best non barndoor 
23 window. Each would have bought that bus, however the rust repair was very 
poorly performed, (pop rivets) the headliner installation sucked and the 
owner played around all day with the price. Each of the buyers walked away. 
They also stayed away from the semi original 60 faded paint 23 window that 
sold for too much $$$. These guys want perfection. Additionally, the more 
hacking the more rare a perfectly restored car becomes and more valuable. 
Hack, hack, hack, I really don't care and you'll see others really don't 
either.
So, I'm all for it, let's get the ball rolling, Concours=value. I want to see 
the value of these buses legitimately go thru the roof and collectors get 
what they pay for not someone's idea of the best.
