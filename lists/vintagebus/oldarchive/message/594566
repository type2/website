   <pre>Hey Volks

Here's the first report from a young Norwegian, Espen Svensen, who is
driving "Mabel", a stock 1959 Kombi, from Cape Agulhas to North Cape, the
southernmost point in Africa to the northernmost point in Europe. Enjoy!

> Greetings friends all over.
>
> Well, here we are at Masai Camp in Arusha, 7646 kms from Cape Agulhas.
> Arusha is located 80 kms west of Kilimanjaro which is the highest mountain
> in Africa (5895 metres). The country is Tanzania if anybody wonders. And -
> we are NOT climbing , we leave that to those who can afford it.
>
> Trip Report no. 1
> ------------------------------
> Wernher and myself started in Pretoria (South Africa) 11th of April after
I
> spent about 1 month getting the car ready for the trip. After the Cape
> Agulhas - Pretoria leg, I noticed that Mabel (that's my car) used a lot of
> oil which she spat out through the tailpipe. New pistons and sleeves went
in
> under the supervision of Werner Alker, whom I stayed with in Pretoria. I
> also put in a new clutch because of some heavy vibration. With new parts
> installed, but not yet tested, we set off for Norway.
>
> Because of the rather hostile situation in Zimbabwe, and the fact that you
> have to wait a couple of hours to get a few litres of petrol, we decided
to
> go through Botswana and Zambia to get to Malwi instead (Find yourself a
> map). The rain that caused the floods in Mozambique had also hit northern
> parts of South Africa, and only two borderposts were open. We chose to use
> Groblersbrug which would give us the straightest route through Botswana.
> Before we left S.A. we stocked up with biltong and droewors (the last
proper
> meat for a while), and crossed the border into Botswana. When we filled
> petrol in Palapye we noticed that Mabel was using a lot of oil again. Not
> being able to find any leaks, I filled up with 1/2 litre Prolong and 1/2
> litre oil, hoping that things would settle themselves in the engine. I
have
> not filled a drop of oil since then. That first day we drove until 3 am,
> covering about 1100 kms, before we pulled off the road to sleep.
>
> We got up at 7 am to cross the border to Zambia at Kazungula as early as
> possible, but after lending tools and assistance to a broken down truck,
and
> having to look for petrol in Kasane for an extra hour, we crossed on the
> ferry about mid day. Customs and immigration in Zambia went easy, and 20
kms
> later we found ourselves at Jungle Junction.
>
> Jungle Junction is a must if you are in Zambia. It is an island about 60
kms
> upstream from Victoria Falls - on the Zambezi river. From the village on
the
> mainland you are paddled/poled in dugout canoes (mokoro) downstream to the
> island, going through some pretty hefty whitewater rapids. As you enter
the
> island, time stops and all you can do is to RELAX. (This is where we
changed
> to Africa time).
>
> We stayed 2 nights on this paradise island before we drove to Livingstone
65
> kms down the road. It was too late in the afternoon to go to Lusaka, so we
> spent the night at Jolly Boys to have an early start the next morning.
> "Early next morning" became 11am before we headed off north-east. What we
> remember of Zambia is:
>
> Police controls (11)
> Potholes (1000's)
> Jungle Junction (1)
>
> Sections of the road is quite OK, but we spent almost 3 days driving the
> 1200 kms through Zambia to Malawi. In Lusaka we stayed at Chachacha
> Bacpackers, where we met 4 norwegian girls that was studying HIV/Aids as a
> part of their doctor studies in Norway. The next stop was a campsite in
> Sinda, only 120 kms from the Malawian border.
>
> We passed the border early in the morning without any hassel. Wernher
wanted
> some material to make pants, and the best place to buy that being the
market
> in Lilongwe, we crawled through the roads of the capital city of Malawi in
> search for material. I had an idea of where to find the market, but it's
> hard to lookfor things and at the same time avoid the crazy taxis, so I
just
> stopped the car on the side of the road while Wernher went out shopping.
He
> came back 1/2 hour later with material and we were ready to continue
towards
> Cape MacLear, which was our plan that evening.
>
> In Malwi it is hard to keep any high average speed, partly because of bad
> and bumpy roads, and partly because of people. People everywhere. On the
> road, in the road, at the road, crossing the road. Every few kilometers
you
> find yourself slowing down because of a mass of people in the road -Bus
Stop
> - men, women, children, goods, goats, cars, bicycles; everything moves
away
> two seconds before you pass to let you through. I've only hit one rooster
on
> all my visits to "the Warm Heart of Africa"
>
> It was already getting quite late in the afternoon when we turned off the
> nice, bumpy surfaced roads, to find that the main dirtroad at Mtakataka
was
> washed away. We were directed to the next turnoff (Golomoti) by some
locals
> at a road-stall. The road, if you can call it that, was passable at
approx.
> 25 kms an hour for the first 30 kms, sometimes having to stop because of
> washed away sections and ditches across the road. It was an hour after
dark,
> when we finally got to see Cape MacLear where we were going to stay for a
> couple of days.
>
> The first evening we spent with old friends, Morne and Marinda, in their
> house on the beach. We got to know their house very well on the first
> evening, when Espen, rather intoxicated on Dan's whiskey, wanted to move
the
> car to the front of the house, and forgot about the resently installed
> roofrack. The next morning revealed the damages: The roof of the house was
> moved a bit (1mtr) and the roofrack was bent. We got some local guys to
help
> us push the house back in position, and put up two poles to support it.
The
> roofrack needed welding, and that was arranged with Kayak Africa, whom we
> spent the next 6 days with.
>
> From Cape Agulhas: 5163 kms (10 days)
> From Pretoria: 2876 kms (7 days)
>
> To be continued............................
