   <pre>Well Ronnie seemed like he was missing out on some trips so here is
our adventure this past weekend.

Friday I tore out the single 34pict-3 and manifold to install the dual
solex 34s. That was fun and I was working on that till about midnight.
I still have to deal with the vacuum advance distributor deal, but for
right now it seems to work well. Sat morning we woke up and got
started packing that morning, instead of the night before. It was
lunch time by the time we make a wally world trip and picked up a few
more things. Tanked up the bus (and the kids too) and started east on
I-40. This was my first real distance with the new carbs so I was
watching the heat temp gauge pretty closely. Basically stayed at under
350 (usually 330ish) on a fully loaded 66 westy w/ kid crap on the
roof rack and 2 adults/3 kids pulling long climbs up hills in east
tn. Not to bad I feel. We made it all the way to Crossville with all
the kids asking when we would be there, etc)

Sometime near dinnertime we pulled into Cumberland Mtn SP. Boy was
that place PACKED. We took a tour of the campground and everything was
full. I had no idea (since I have never camped on Mem day before) that
it would be this full. I just assumed everyone went to the lake :) I
stopped at the reg cabin and asked about some alternatives. She
suggested looking to see if anyone had left, but since we had already
done that it wasn't looking very good. I got directions to a small
private campground from her. After driving down old hwy 70 to it we
realized it was just a big field w/ rvs in it. Not exactly good bus
camping. Everyone was in their air conditioned land yachts and no one
seemed to be even aware of our presence. Especially the office, which
was closed. 

With everyone getting hungry and only a few hours of daylight left we
called all the local camps who all said "no room". This was quite the
bummer. Steph got on her phone and got my mom back in Dickson to look
on the web and get some phone numbers of parks within an hour of us.
We got Picket first on the list, and when I called the nice girl who
answered said they did have some lots, tent lots though. I asked if it
was big enough for an ole' VW bus. A minutes pause and she said
"sure". We were happy campers now, and only about 45 minutes south of
our final destination. I hauled it north up hwy 127 which is a pretty
decent drive, although a bit curvy in areas. We arrived at the park
with plenty of light left to setup camp. Found a great site with
enough of a flat spot to put the bus and the new side tent. 

As we preceded to setup and cook the park Naturalist came by to invite
us on a hike to see the glow worms in a nearby cave. We had to decline
since we were working on camp, but when was the last time you were
invited to go do something by one of the natrualists in a state park?
Very cool. A few minutes later we met the camp hosts who were very
nice people, gave us some insight into some goings on in the area, and
parted. We all got setup and had hot dogs and hamburgers. By the time
we all finished and cleaned up it was bed time, so everyone hit the
sack. This was our first outing with the side tent bus depot sells by
just kampers. If you have more than one kid going to camp outs with
you, you NEED this. It was fantastic having that much extra space for
everyone. We had room to put stuff and ever spread out. It was a bit
humid that night, with very little breeze until later. A small rain
shower came rolling in, and made a very peaceful sound on the tent and
top of the bus. 

Sunday morning we awoke to a nice cool day. Got everyone up and
started on breakfast burritos. After breakfast and cleanup, we took a
few trails (which is quite the experience with a preganent wife and 3
kids). We also hiked to a local suspension bridge, which the kids
enjoyed a lot, but the wife didn't. With a little bit more walking we
found the boat house and rented a fishing boat we could all fit
in. We make a leisurely row around the lake letting the kids try their
hand at rowing and found ourselves back at the starting point, so we
decided to head back to camp for lunch. When I returned the talk of
the camp was that a pretty nasty storm was on the way w/ damaging
winds that nasty stuff like that. We discussed what to do over lunch
and finally decided to not tempt mother nature and head back. </pre>
