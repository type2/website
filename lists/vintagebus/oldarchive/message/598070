   <h1>LONG 1st jerome trip</h1>
   <b>craig &lt;vwbus_at_ckoon_dot_org&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2004-09-16 07:38:24+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>... was interesting. from the tales i had heard, it was neither as 
family-oriented nor as crazed as i had been led to believe. not sure 
which was worse!
actually went w/ the caravan; a note to the abc folks: not EVERYONE 
in the parking lot is a member. i had no idea who to pay, where we 
were going, etc. some info or at a least a frickin MAP on the webpage 
would be nice. this caused me to miss the turnoff in prescott 
valley... where the hell did all the busses go? note to self: if you 
pass the SLOWER busses, but can't keep up w/ the FASTER busses, you 
will be on yer own!  came upon a nasty accident involving a gravel 
truck outside of prescott. found a guy in an orange panel (jack) who 
told me where to go, and informed me of his 'alternate' route; this 
had me driving back and forth along 89a looking for forest service 
roads over the mountain. which thankfully i didn't find, as i 
discovered later.
found a disabled bus and stopped with some others, but it had dual 
dells or somesuch. outta my league - travel on!

as i went up the mountain, the bus got more and more sluggish; in 
fact, full throttle would bog it down tremendously. oil at 210, heads 
at 350, pressure at 45, so no probs there..........  adjust carb 
mixtures and continue slowly.
found the camp, and was right behind a singlecab (driven by a nice 
couple whose names i never got) which ran out of gas RIGHT at top of 
hill. as i was still ON the hill, this was a problem; my tires would 
not bite on the gravel. then i popped outta 1st and damn near slid 
into a squareback - for which crime i got glares and insults all 
weekend from the driver and a teenybopper w/ her belly hanging out. 
pfah - kids, don't stop so close behind a stick on a hill!

camped below the missile. interesting spot. uncrowded on friday, but 
the scene of quite a party - those who claim friday was quiet must 
have been passed out!  lots of james brown from a bug, some flame 
twirling... no hassles until what i assume was the infamous 'rubber 
johnny' got started... not only did i get to listen to inept bongo 
playing, the words DUDE SH*T and F*CK used as a sentence, and his 
opinions on music, i ALSO was privileged to hear his preferences on 
'bitches' and their techniques: how he likes it when he's full 
throttle and they holler HARDER, and how he prefers his oral 
pleasures. WITH sound effects. stephanie, lisa, if you are out there: 
if this loser can't keep up with you, or appreciate your talents, 
time to move on!
and i thought the terrible twos crew had the loudest voices on earth...........

saturday i spent most of the day in jerome; got back in time for the 
band. which was a shame. look, i ain't even a member of abc, so what 
i say counts fer doodoo, but i HAVE been involved in the music biz 
for nigh on 20 years; my personal dislke of the  band and songs 
notwithstanding, the abc might wish to rethink the live band gig... 
is it a vw campout, or a show? trust me, the stinkfoots looking for 
the next dead/phish/matthews/excuse to get loaded will simply add 
jerome to their list. might not be a Good Thing.
hell, i had stinkfoot friends in texas, but their idea of a good time 
and mine rarely intersected. unless massive quantities of mushrooms 
were involved. then i get VEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRY tolerant.

tuned the bus for the helluvit saturday. points were near closed. 
WTF? put em back at 48 dwell, adjusted advance and tweaked carb. took 
out weepy oil pressure piston and put it back in. to no avail - still 
leaks. told ronnie that the aluminum crapcase made it, but dripped a 
whole QUART from various orifices. ronnie would like me to remind 
everyone that he did bend over backwards to help me in my saga.
met clara and bored her to tears, sorry clara. i am sometimes more 
interesting to talk to. sometimes.
sat nite was goldurn BORING. except for the start - in jerome, my 
wife (who was in a hotel w/ my parents and son) turned to me and 
said: 'wasn't that a bus FULL of skinheads?' sure was! at the camp, 
these guys (who may or may not have been skinheads, neonazis or even 
mean to cats and small children) began to f*ck with peoples minds - 
jumping in the fire, yelling, etcetc. the hippies FREAKED. it got so 
bad that fights nearly ensued, the fire at that site was doused, and 
everyone dispersed. now, i may have long hair, but i have been a punk 
for 25 years. i was vastly amused. i enjoy antisocial behavior of all 
stripes, and these guys were pros :)  i really don't think they were 
out to cause serious trouble, but they looked so out of place that 
the vibe was all wrong for most of the crowd. best part was when one 
of em won best rat rod  LOFLMAO!!

sunday i watched the raffle, intending to cut out as soon as i didn't 
win. finally met beto pena, rob laffoon, jp, ricky fu and a few 
others for a few minutes. most all were busy packing up so i stayed 
outta the way.
didn't win the bus... but the drama was so good i stayed til end. who 
was the snoozer, a VTO member? man, i'd  kick the *ss of my buddies 
if they didn't wake me. hopefully, it was rubber johnny.</pre>
