   <h1>OCTO/Classic Trip report (long)</h1>

   <br/>
   <pre>Hi everyone,
Well, I guees I'll start my detailed report with what I drove down. 1963 
hardtop deluxe turquoise and white and it's a walk-thru
I started friday afternoon around noon leaving from Concord which is in the 
SF Bay Area. Tried to meet up with some friends who were trailering their 
pink 23 window down to sell. They ended up being a few hours behind schedule 
so we left a ways before them.
After a two hour drive we met some friends from Sacramento at the Anderson's 
Pea Soup Restaurant. Checked the motor and everything was running smooth.
Left Anderson's around 2pm for the rest of the trip down I-5. For those who 
don't know, this is the worst freeway in the world, in the middle of nowhere 
for hundreds of miles, and not a great place to be.
Somewhere down I-5 near the town of Coalinga, where the Harris Ranch 
slaughter house is (stinks really bad) I hear a slight whining sound and 
about 15 seconds later my generator light comes on. No big deal I think, pull 
over, open the engine lid, fan belt still there. Generator is smoking really 
bad. Sh*t was my initial reaction. No spare gen. with me. Then comes the 
bright idea!!!  Drive on it anyways, fan is still turning, can't do anything 
but get worse.
Well, we drive on anyways, and 300 miles and about 6 hours we arrive in 
Irvine running off the battery and the gen is smoking really bad by that time.
Decided to check out the gen after we unloaded everything into the hotel 
rooms, pulley moves up and down about 1/2". Lost the front bearing and it ate 
through the housing and left a big hole.
Sat. morning I really wanted to drive my bus to the OCTO show even with the 
bad gen. Bus fired right up on the first crank even after running off the 
battery for almost 6 hours.
OCTO show was great, tons of parts, NOS and rare. Lots of  beautiful busses. 
OCTO did an awesome job hosting this new show for the Classic.
Spent the whole morning looking for a gen. but no one had one. Ended up at 
BFY down the road for a new Bosch one for $90. Not bad, but it'll get me home.
Toy show was perfect, bought one piece I've been looking for for a while. 63 
deluxe aluminum coat hooks, this one just happened to have my como green 
vinyl hand strap. That was my find of the day. Not too bad at $40. Bought a 
few toys and books at a decent price.
Saw a barndoor era toy bus about 4 inches long with a clear removeable roof 
with people in it. Asking price $750. Whoa!! That's expensive
After the toy show and letting my motor cool down, I spent the next 5 1/'2 
hours removing my gen. and installing the new one. Yes, it was way too long. 
But when you're doing it in the parking lot of the host hotel for the Classic 
and people are coming by and watching and talking and crowding around for a 
mechanical show. And yes, the gen. can be removed and replaced without 
pulling the motor. 
Bus fired right up after putting it back together, and very happily, no gen. 
light on.
Decided it was time for a few cold beers after that experience.
Ended up being a long night of talking to people in the parking lot of the 
hotel. Met a few listees who were great. 
Craig did an outstanding job on the vintagebus name tags and sheets for our 
busses.
Classic went great, sooo many parts and cars for sale. Lots of busses in the 
show area. Too many to talk about.
Finally left the Classic around 2pm for the drive home. Got stuck behind an 
accident by LAX airport in the dead heat and hotter than hell going over the 
grapevine. Bus ran really hot until I reached the other side. 30 weight oil 
was running a little thin in the hot weather, but thickened up as it cooled 
down. Ran a lot better too. About 20 minutes North of the grapevine we heard 
a very loud thump and bang. Scared the crap out of us. Pulled over, engine 
still running, nothing leaking or missing. Strange!! I looked under the front 
of the bus and saw my horn wires had come free. Go to plug them back in and 
no horn, it had broken off and fell. That's what the loud noise was.
Got back on the road and finally made it home around midnight. Definately my 
biggest adventure so far in my deluxe.
Over the past few days I logged around 1400 miles and around 21 hours of 
driving which included gas and bathroom breaks.
Averaged 20 mpg on normal freeway driving. Almost 17 mpg during the grapevine 
experiences, and roughly 15-16 during the big windstorm we encountered near 
I-5 and 580
An overall great experience. Happy it's over and I can finally get a good 
nights sleep.
Hope everyone else had a pretty good trip and nothing major happened.
Seems like generators were the problem of the weekend. John Howard nuked one 
also, another guy at the OCTO show lost an oil cooler, one guy on the Phoenix 
caravan lost a tire and drum.
Not sure about what anyone else experienced, but I'm glad to be home
