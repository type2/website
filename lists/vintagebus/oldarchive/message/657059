   <h1>Finally got a bus :-)</h1>
   <b>Rhunes29_at_aol_dot_com</b><br/>
   <i>2000-03-30 05:52:49+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>After months of being on the list w/o actually having a bus, I somehow got 
kicked off the list when I hadn't gone online for a while. Instead of signing 
back on and just reading about learning from all your Q's, I decided to 
really try to get a bus. I put a "wanted ad" on every site I could think of. 
Then when I was on Everett's classifieds one day, I wondered if I had an ad 
on that site. I thought I did because I o on it every day. Not knowing for 
sure, I posted another wanted ad that said I was not interested in cash, but 
only wanted to trade my '54 b*g for an early type 2. The very next day, I had 
7 responses from people who wanted to make the trade, and 2 from people who 
did offer money. While most of the offers were for buses that were in really 
bad shape, two were for decent ones. One was a '65 that had good paint and 
was a daily driver. I turned it down though for a '58 that needs a little 
work. I emailed the guy a couple times with the '58 and he called me last 
wednesday. We decided to meet the next day on thursday. He is from No Cal, 
and I am in So Cal, so we met at Harris Ranch, which is a truck stop in 
Central Cal. This is where it gets good... 
    Some of my favorite stories the lists post are how they actually get 
their buses, because they are always an adventure. I was not an exception. 
After getting a late start, driving for 3 1/2 hours, and spending $63 on gas, 
I met up with the guy. I had used some cheap wood for ramps to get my '54 on 
a flatbed trailer. They broke rolling it off the trailer. This was a problem. 
Luckily I took my cousin and my friend with me, and The other guy took two 
friends with him. Five of us lifted the front end onto the trailer up to the 
tires. Then we rolled it up to the rear tires, and 4 of us actually lifted it 
about 2 ft. up to get it on the trailer. One guy stayed in front of it to 
keep it from rolling all the way to the front, and my cousin was filming, 
because I always take a video camera on little adventures. By the time we 
talked about each car, made the trade, and got back on the road, it was a 
little after midnight. We all just wanted to get home. Because of this, my 
friend who offered to drive was going at about 75 mph on the I 5. We both saw 
it coming when hit a dip at 75. I had been staring back the whole way home to 
gaze at the front end of my new splitty. Right after hitting the dip, when I 
looked back, I saw nothing. My friend thought I was kidding when I told him 
it wasn't there until he looked back and freaked. We stopped and pulled over 
to look back, when all of the sudden, through the headlights of cars a few 
hundred yards back, we saw the distinctive split windshield heading straight 
towards us. MY friend hit the gas and I jumped out running towards it. After 
a few seconds, I realized it was going at about 40 mph straight toward me, I 
panicked and stopped dead in my tracks. When it got about 30 yards from me it 
veered to the left and went into a ditch, taking out a wooden pole that had 
the whole freeway lined with barbed wire. The sound of that huge, hollow body 
hitting a pole made me yell a few words that I would rather not repeat. I ran 
up to the bus and saw that it was FINE, except for some paint stripped off, 
that revealed about 5 different colors. We used the truck to pull it out of 
the ditch, but were not able to get it back onto the trailer with only 3 of 
us. After a short struggle, we were able to get the steering box onto the 
trailer. We tied the front bumper to the trailer and pretty much idled onto 
the shoulder for about a mile to a truck stop that we were extremely lucky 
was there. We got a trucker to lend us some 4x4's to use as ramps and we got 
it right back on the trailer. We tied it down much better than it was, and 
went the rest of the way home. We had left at 6 PM and got home a 4:30 AM the 
next morning. BUT I FINALLY GOT MY BUS!!! :-)  :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)</pre>
