   <h1>The Southern Saga - Part 8: The Journey Home</h1>
   <b>&quot;Brian M. Wittling&quot; &lt;kdfmotors_at_primary_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1999-05-13 09:48:03+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>I awoke Monday morning to the sounds of Neil and Mary Kay getting ready for
work, and George coming in for coffee and a shower (the singing shower,
remember?  George doesn't know 'the trick').  With all the folks around,
Neil and Mary Kay called in to say they'd be late, and we had a quick
breakfast of bagels and coffee (tea, Earl Grey for me).  It was surely going
to be a long day, and I had to get moving if I wanted to be home at a
reasonable hour.  Plans for the morning included a quick tune-up on the bus,
and somewhere along the way I wanted to stop and get myself one of them
new-fangled stroboscopic timing lights.  And if time permitted, I was still
tossing around the idea of heading up to the parkway for a "top of the
parkway" sticker.

It didn't take long for Neil to get ready, and soon after he and Mary Kay
were driving off to work in the 66 Deluxe. Not without Neil making one more
attempt to get me to stay another day though <grin>. That left the rest of
us hanging around the house for the morning, the drill being only to lock up
when we finally broke camp.  George left soon after, headed back to Georgia
I suppose, and I remained along with the couple in the big pickup/camper
combo.  While they were getting ready, I dove under the back of the bus for
my 2nd Valve adjustment of the trip (all slightly tight again) and when I
checked the timing, I was in for a real shock. Remember how Dave had set it
up for total advance with the light?  Well it worked out that statically,
this meant it was at about 20 degrees BTDC!!  Yowsa!  Surely that wasn't
right!  It must have slipped somewhere along the way, and maybe that's why I
was having so much trouble on the way to Neil's. I took my best guess on the
timing, and set it just before the mark on the pulley, which I believed to
be about 5 deg. BTDC.  It sure seemed to idle a lot better, and not smoke as
much after that anyway.  The RV couple it turns out would be heading the
same way for a while, so we decided to drive together to the rest stop just
before the Tennessee border on 40.

Well, it was a good idea anyway.. as it would turn out, I only succeeded in
making the bus worse.. I guess it really does need to be set that far BTDC
statically!  It was an ultimate struggle just to do 50mph, and the head
temps were up to their same old tricks.  What was really even more
frustrating, is that I got stuck behind some big ole' Mercedes Benz doing
about 40mph, and I could never get up speed on the downhills to make it over
the uphills because of them!  What #$^%ing jerks!  That Benz could have done
120mph without even blinking!   This was horrible, and there was no doubt in
my mind that if I tried to go up on the parkway, I'd die, or at least end up
with a bus like Danny Morganelli's. I limped into the rest stop well behind
the RV'ers, and immediately got out my 'engine stool' and the appropriate
tools.  The first order of business was that I wanted to switch back to the
stock main jet on the carb, since I was still getting a VERY black tail
pipe, and crappy mileage. Funny though, the plugs STILL looked like I was
running a bit lean, even in that thin mountain air.  I also bumped my timing
up to what I thought was about 15-20BTDC statically, and made a mental note
to REALLY monitor the motor for sounds of pinging and stuff.  With that
going on, the RV couple were busy making some breakfast, ands treated me to
a really awesome breakfast burrito!  WOW, that sucker was tasty!   It was
probably about 10AM or so by that time, and I needed to get moving again.
We said our good-byes, and I took off back onto 40, doing about 50
balls-out.

The motor sounded OK, and the going was a bit easier since the highway
between the NC border to about halfway to Nashville is mostly downhill.
When I got to Knoxville though, I decided this would be a good time to go
looking for a Auto-Zone or something to get a timing light.  I jumped off 40
and onto state hwy 70, which I knew from previous trip more or less runs
parallel to 40...  it also takes you through lots of little towns and
'strip-mall' area where I was sure to find an auto parts store or two.  The
1st place I tried was a K-Mart, who didn't have a light.  Then I went to an
Auto-Zone, where I had to wait in line for about 30 minutes to be told they
don't carry them anymore.  The clerk there said that I might be able to find
one at the Pep Boys about "a mile or so" down the road, on the left hand
side.  So I went off in search of the Pep Boys.  And drove, and drove.  And
drove some more...  About 10 miles down the road I finally saw it... on the
right hand side!  I swerve over, cutting off a few people, and nearly
hitting a truck that was in my blind spot (jeesh I miss my Deluxe some
times!) and into the Pep Boys.  There I found me a nice  gun-unit with a
dial for total advance and everything.  For hid unit, I had the privilege of
paying about 75$!!  Zoiks!  I was now OFICCIALLY over-budget on this trip!
I set my timing out in the parking lot, and it seemed to idle a bit better,
but the real test was yet to come.

I was rather enjoying the more relaxed pace of 70, so I decided to stay the
road for a while.  70 runs parallel to 40, even crossing it several times,
so I wouldn't be too far off course, and I could get back onto the highway
quickly whenever I felt.     I must have stayed on 70 for about 40 miles or
so, when an entrance to the highway presented itself, so I decided it was
time to give it a try.  I had been running nice and cool up 'til that point.
Once on the highway though, things changed...  The winds were picking up
again, coming from the south west, and hitting me in sort of a
frontal-broadside fashion.. winds are not my friend.  I was able to keep her
up to 55, but my head temps were running awfully high.  About 450-500
consistently.  And my oil temps were way up too. About 170 on my oil!
Anyway, I rode the highway for a bit, listening to my Tom Petty CD's, or the
truckers on CB...

I was about halfway between Knoxville and Nashville by then...  it was about
1:20 or so in the afternoon.. clouding up a bit..  I might just get rained
on for the first time in this trip I thought.  At that point, it will be
important to note that I saw a particular hitch-hiker on the highway.. I had
seen many on the trip, but pay attention to this one.. he's important to the
story..  He wasn't a dirty bum type as the others were, this guy was
sporting a crew-cut, big hiking boots, and a giant metal-framed backpack,
walking with his thumb out.   I didn't stop for him, but he did stick in my
mind...   Sometimes I will pick up the occasional hiker..  Good karma I
think.  Once when my bug ran out of gas, an older gentleman stopped for me
and he was even running late for a flight at the airport.  It would have
taken me about 2 hours to walk to the nearest gas station, and this guy
saved my whole evening!  He even offered to drive me back to my bug, but I
declined, telling him he'd better get going.. I could just call my
girlfriend for a ride.  So, I have vowed to return that favor as often as
possible.. this time though, the mood just didn't strike me for some reason.</pre>
