   <h1>My Classic Weekend</h1>
   <b>Ronnie Feitelson &lt;Ronnie_at_OldVolks_dot_com&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2001-06-11 18:32:59+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Friday;  The Havasu caravan hooks up at 6 am and leaves to Christmas Tree
Island, 8 buses, no problems, cruising 60-65, Stop at fellow listy Hart
Ponders house in Yucca to deliver his 21 window, waiting for us were donuts
and OJ, a welcome break from the 4 hour drive.  

NEWS FLASH; just came in. JP just called and he is on his way to Havasu. We
had a small BUS problem. Berry in his logoed DD broke down in Yucca, Cal. on
his way home, I had decided to come home last night and got a call from JP
on my cell that Berry had broken down in Yucca, a quick change in my route
home and I was in Yucca looking for Berry. As luck would have it I found him
driving down the street. A few phone calls later we had Hart Ponder come
down (he lives in Yucca), Berry followed him up to his house, he spent the
night there and JP picked him up on his way back to NM. This is what bussing
is all about, looking out for and helping each other.

So, we continued on from there heading to CTI with a stop over in Cabazon to
wait for the Phoenix caravan. They never showed but we did pick up 2 more
buses there. On we went to CTI, where the buses just kept rolling in.

Friday; afternoon. From CTI a few of us headed out to West Coast Classics,
for the pre OCTO industry party, Lenny as always had one heck of a spread of
food with Mr. Okrassa himself as the cook. To many cool VW's at Lennys to
look at and the food was awesome. The who's who of the VW world were there,
as was French TV filming the whole thing. The buskateirs finally showed as
did Britt, after they were all fed off we went back to CTI to a load of
buses, 46 at last count.

Sat morning; At 4;30 am VW Howard started waking everyone up for the MONSTER
Busavan to OCTO, for a change everyone was ready and the Busavan left before
it's departure time. An hour or so later we were pulling into OCTO which was
already abuzz with activity and it was only a little after 7 am!  We all
pulled in at the same time double file, it WAS a site to see. As always the
gate went smooth and there was NO waiting to get in. Those OCTO boys KNOW
how to run a show.
  Octo was awesome, I wish I would of had more time to look, but my duties
called and I was stuck at my swap area. It was great meeting all the listys
I have never seen and at Noon they all came by for the LISTY photo, sans
Everett (VW Planet) Barns who disappeared right before the photo. The word
has it he was waiting for all the listys to get together so he could score
all the NOS parts while they were all together in one spot.
After OCTO people went there own ways and a pile of them ended up at the VTO
sponsored camp-out at Irvine Lake, who knows how many buses were there but I
would guesstimate 50 or more. The VTO club held a raffle and it was fun with
at least 100 plus people all gathered around the camp fire for this way to
funny and fun raffle, with VW Howard winning at least 5 times including the
50/50 (money) which he generously donated back to the VTO Club, way to go
Howard.

Sunday: Sunday morning was a very laid back morning with people leaving at
there own pace, The general consensus was, scr#w the Classic, I would say
less then 1/4 of the people at the camp-out went. Well I did, Vw Howard and
I pulled out and led a small caravan to the Classic, which went very smooth.
Then we get there, it took longer to get in then it did to get there and we
were 40 or so miles away!!! 
  I decided not to set-up there so I could cruise around, the first time in
5 years and had a blast for a change.
  There were  more BUSES at OCTO then the Classic,  they were all the same
buses that were at OCTO, so didn't need to look at those, as well as the
swap people, all the same as OCTO. I did score a box of NOS 58 to 61 TL lens
for a pretty penny, but I am starting to collect these, just to see how many
different variations there are. I now have 4 different variations of NOS
58-61 lens and will someday photograph all of them and then try to
date/figure out WHY so many variations?</pre>
