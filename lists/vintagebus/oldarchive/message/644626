   <h1>Jerome report/story- Binz maiden voyage (Long)</h1>
   <b>&quot;LilBlauWagen&quot; &lt;wades_wagens_at_qwest_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2003-09-19 12:50:03+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>After seeing the Jerome countdown clock wind to an end, it was painfully obvious that it was going
to be another one of those last minute rush round the clock build offs, if the Binz were to be
"ready" in time for the show. It was completely driveable but theres all those little things you
want to do before you go. And of course test driving is a nice idea in theory, although it never
seems to happen for me.

So I ended up once again working straight thru thursday night (not counting the previous 4 or 5
months) and pulling out of the driveway at 9 am on friday with the Binz never having seen the
interstate highway since 1978 and me not having seen the comfy side of my pillow since many months
prior, or so it seemed. The neighbors must've wondered what the hell is that guy doing out there in
the driveway cutting oak slats for what appears to be a large pioneer style covered wagon hoop
arrangement at 6 AM on a Friday morning. Ah well. This would be the Binz maiden voyage since I dont
count driving it around the neighborhood as being a true test of road compatibility. I had 4
passengers as well that looked at me with a certain dependency and uneasyness, as they wondered if
this would be another one of 'those trips' in an unknown untested vehicle.

We neared the freeway and saw that the cops had the entrance ramps blocked off. Not good, never
gonna catch the cruise now. I sputtered under the bridge and made my way toward the gas station. I
noticed the reserve cable was pulled out to the reserve position for no reason that I could
remember, so i pushed it back in and pulled into the nearest gas station. I topped off the tank at
the pumps and made my way out of the gas station and bam, the engine died. Have spark, fuel in the
filter, what is the problem? I try again and it starts up. Ah yes, it *is* going to be one of those
trips i thought to myself. I barely make it back to the main road and bam, there it goes again, wont
run. Electrics are good. Fuel filter had some in it. Pulled the fuel line and had my friend turn the
engine over and nothing came out of the fuel pump. The small amount in the filter had fooled me.
Figured out that the reserve cable hadnt been adjusted properly and pushing the reserve cable all
the way in was actually shutting off the petcock. Pull the cable all the way out to reserve and that
was the last i heard from that problem for the rest of the trip.

We were somewhere outside prescott valley, on the edge of the desert, when the real troubles began
to take hold. I reached down and felt my stomach drop as i notice the gear shift moving freely side
to side and front to back as though it didnt actually do anything and was merely installed for
cosmetic appearances. Thats when your mind races and you scan back to all the work youve done and
you race up and down the checklist in your head and - Shift rod coupler! of course. Shoulda changed
it - It was now sheared in half. Pull over and try to wire it together with wire scraps laying on
the side of the road (why is there always piles of wire laying on the side of the road?) Waited
around for an hour for that lonely straggler cruise bus to come tooling by but that didnt happen. My
friend muttered "you brought your AIRS list right?" I didnt respond to that comment since I hadn't
and it prolly wouldnt have mattered since all the locals were at Jerome! The rig up didnt work with
what we had found so some passerbys gave me a ride back to Mayer Vee dub which is a newer shop in
Mayer AZ. Got the coupler and made my way back to the Binz and saw that another friend that I was
supposed to be catching up to had left from the cruise and came back to help me and had been
crawling around underneath the binz, wiring it up in best jerry rig fashion as if he had done that a
hundred times. He told me he thought it would make it and seemed pretty confident. I hadn't slept
yet, so not climbing back down and redoing it sounded great. I decide to leave it with everyone
cheering me on saying "it'll be good". Of course that came from 2 women who had been sitting in a
slowbake bus for an hour and just wanted to get to the show.

 I was nervous since the mountains loomed ahead, but with my senses blurred and the sun baking down,
i went for it. I get into the 1 lane, slow, steep, climbing grades in Mingus mountains and sure
enough that was a mistake. Try to downshift out of 3rd and it wouldnt go into 1st or 2nd. I tried it
a couple of times and by then i was at a dead stop and stuck in 3rd or 4th gear. I tried slipping
the clutch to go up in 3rd but that wasnt gonna happen on this grade, and the traffic began to
backup behind me which consisted of 4 or 5 lowered beetles. I try to put it in reverse and managed
to get 2nd gear instead so i was off again. Shortly after, I hit the border of  Jerome and worked my
way up the rock hill of death to see countless buses smiling at me as i pulled in. Unpacked and
replaced the coupler the next day when i was relaxed and fully awake.

 Picked up my new tilt canvas from Tom bueses, specially made for the Binz with the double gate
loops, looked really nice and fit like a glove. threw it on immediately and it was awesome. Thanks
tom!</pre>
