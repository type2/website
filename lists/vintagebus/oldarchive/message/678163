   <h1>Trip report, High Country Bus Fest, or, How I spent my summer</h1>
   <b>Mad Uncle Dave &lt;MadUncleDave_at_charter_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2006-07-30 18:18:08+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Thursday dawned and I was already up to see it, since I had to rabbit at 
the parts store until noon.  Fed crites, off to work, the clock crawled 
even slower then usual.  Finally noon arrived, into the phone booth to 
put on recreating duds and out the door into a pouring rainstorm.  The 
bus had a huge oil leak, part of which was a valve cover gasket.  I 
replaced that and went next door for a bite and to bide my time until 
the rain slacked some.  Finally the rain quit, fired up the bus and off 
we went.  Up 321 towards Boone we went, to be stopped at the bottom of 
the mountain because they were blasting and moving rock.  No big deal, 
by then it was about 1:15 and the pimply-faced attitude boy said the 
road'd be open by 2.  Cool.  No sense turning around and doing the 
detour, by the time I got to Wilkesboro the road would have been open 
here, and because of the oil leak I want to take the shortest populated 
route I can.  Pulled out the guitar and picked away for about 30 minutes 
or so, checked added oil (3 quarts so far in under 20 miles), got back 
in just in time for the road to open.  I don't know what's inside this 
engine but it pulls strong!  We ran much of the hill in 4th gear where 
the Award Winning Burrito Express ran 3rd or 2nd, only a couple spots 
where I had to downshift.  One was a grade that we lost too many RPMs 
and got off the cam & carbs, the other was behind some guy driving on a 
flat tire.  It also probably helps that I'm traveling much lighter these 
days.

Next stop in Blowing Rock to add more oil.  Left turns coming into town 
made the oil pressure drop so I knew it was time.  Added 2 more quarts.  
Onward and upwards, around the twisty part between Blowing Rock and 
Boone, having fun dicing with the SUVs that handle better than a bus but 
people are afraid or unable to drive close to their 
capabilities.             Next stop in Boone, yet another quart of oil 
in the Wally World parking lot.  She's not burning it, it's spewing out 
the crack in the case and at the case seam where the mating surfaces are 
worn.  When I got this but I pulled the engine to check head torque.  It 
was missing 1 case nut (the big ones) and 4 of the remaining 5 nuts were 
so loose I could get almost 1.5 turns each before they seated to the 
case.  Near as I can figure the case expanding with heat opens the 
crack, and the wear from the case halves chattering together from being 
loose beat the sealing capabilities between the halves.

Last stretch to the campground with no major drama.  Register then up to 
the camping area.  Look at the top of the hill.  Drive down to the 
bowl.. Do doughnuts in the grass out of the sheer joy of being at a 
campout.  Run up the hill again, turn around, and we come to rest across 
from where Buddah and Snoopy are camped.  Good a spot as any.  Set up 
takes almost no time, wander around saying hi to everyone that's already 
there.  Enjoy the day and into early evening.  Pasta Fazool for dinner, 
an easy tasty meal, make enough to share with Jamie Auch and 
Tony&Paula.  Dinner dishes done, wander around, play some guitar, help 
TieDie James put up the garage.  Severe unwinding happening here.

Friday morning dawned and I wasn't up to see it.  I finally rolled out, 
looked up at the sky, said Hmmmm.  Put on running duds, went and made 
coffee instead of running.  Shared some coffee with Lala, because Snoopy 
doesn't drink coffee so doesn't have the  makings, then kicked it into 
gear and ran up the hill until the road turned to trail to path then 
almost nothing.  (I run until I run outta breath then walk , then pick 
it back up when I can breathe again)  When I couldn't see where my feet 
were going I turned around and headed back down the hill.  Been a couple 
years since I've been up there, it's grown in quite a bit.  While I was 
up there I saw a good sized deer print, and some fox poop.  The fox had 
been eating berries and a small rodent.  Back down the hill, into the 
shower.  Walk around watching folks roll in slowly like they do Friday 
morning into afternoon.  Lunch from a can because I didn't feel like 
getting extravagant.  Play some guitar, hang out, walk around and talk.

Invited Vicky to dinner, pizza's on the menu tonight.  Gary was working 
on their house and couldn't make the campout  The camping oven was worth 
the investment because I think pizza made with fresh dough is a perfect 
camping food.  Fun to make, tasty, and smells so good while it's 
baking.  Bill the Troll came by while I was making the dough, then Royce 
came over and gave me the makings for a monkey's fist, a knot I haven't 
tied in over 15 years.  2 tries and I had it done.

Pizzas in the over and Vicky comes over.  It's very nice to eat 
fresh-made pizza with a pretty lady across the table from you.  We 
talked about this and that and then with dinner over and the rain 
starting, Vicky left to close the windows in her bus and I got to do the 
dishes again.</pre>
