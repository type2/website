   <br/>
   <pre>Hey y'all
Went to Octoberbus last weekend.  Didn't get there until late friday.
Best start at the beginning huh?
Hooked up with 4 other busses at the intersection of 17A and 176 outside
of Charleston.  We were supposed to meet at 4:30 but we all hit traffic,
I waited for the train to go by.  We didn't get on the road until 5:30.

Ok off we go, up 176 to Columbia - almost.  CB's on Channel 2 (tribute
to Bowie's StarMan).  I was point because I'm the slowest bus with the
smallest gas tank.  Derek & Snoopy hit the Mt Dew real hard and so they
had to pee before the 1st scheduled fuel stop.  So Royce & I pulled off
& waited while Snoopy, Derek, Steve, and Ben & family stopped.  Finally
Royce & I headed up to the designated fueling spot.  Fueled, de-watered,
and dinner in hand we waited and finally the other 3 busses arrived.
Steve had no tail lights so we told him to run in the rocking chair and
don't worry about it.  We got it together for leg 2.

Steve decided he really didn't want to travel with no tail lights so we
did unplanned stop 2.  Fiddlef*&#ed with his cracked fuse block and
finally Ben hot wired the tail lights.  Fed the remainder of the hungry
horde and on the road again (sure as you're born - natural born
easy...).  Chuffling along the Tinkertoy's cruising her usual 62 +-.
She's been running a bit rough for the last couple days.  I figured the
points had closed up the usual .002 in 1k miles.  Fix that later but
that don't change the increased fuel consumption.  Fuel stop by
Statesboro NC.  Oil checks to perform. Royce notices his alternator
belt's gone.  Fortunately he's running a pancake so his fan kept going.
Derek puts the new belt on.  Ben noticed a MAJOR fuel leak, we all
figure it's from around his fuel filler neck.  Doublecheck the fire
extinguishers and off we go for the last leg.  No more troubles all the
way to the camp site.  Set up camp, nighty pops to all - I worked the 24
hrs before and got about 3 hrs sleep in the last 42 so I was beat.  Last
'event' of the night was Steve's bus rolling backwards towards camp.  We
all thought he'd gone to sleep up the hill, out of gear with the e-brake
off.  He was just coming down to level ground.  In case you haven't
figured it out, Steve's a bit of a character.

Saturday Morning.  co-operative cooking.  Tinkertoyman's breakfast
Burritos.  MMMMMMM.  scrambled egg, saut√©ed onions, peppers, mushrooms,
Chouriso or hot italian sausage.  The local Kmart has a decent
chouriso!  We had invited Doc Ric and Sean Bartnic but neither came so I
had to eat 2 burritos!  Pete from Ontario showed up after spending the
night broke down alongside the highway.  He fixed it in the morning and
came to help us camp - what a trooper!  We pretty much hung out, walked
around, politely turned down numerous offers to hang with the Yes
Crowd.  See there was a "Yes Camp" happening up the way and there was a
50/50 mix of normal folks who like Yes and some real creepy people too.
That from someone who isn't exactly mainstream America.  Dragged out a
fallen Red Oak for the fire, went about and looked at busses, talked
with bus people, and generally did bus campout stuff.  Jennifer's bus is
being painted and the newest addition to her bus is way cool - Arlo
Guthrie's autograph!  Met Dave Easterwood, hung with the Gurus for a
while, returned to camp.  Decided to open up the points so the Tinkertoy
will run gooder.  When I went and popped the clips off the dizzy cap the
cap fell into 2 pieces, cylinders 143 to 1 side, 2 to the other.  No
wonder she ran a tad rough.  Break out the get me home dizzy, take the
cap off, open the points (exactly .002!) replace cap, retime and the
Tinkertoy fired on her usual 3/4 of a rotation.  We held a 'slightly
used parts sale in front of the camp - my cap (on reserve on e-bay for
$15), Derek's bashed in conrod & piston from the 1st engine he ever
built, and 1 of Steve's hubcaps.   Oh yeah did I mention Steve went off
to visit a buddy who 'only' lived a couple miles away (he was gone 9
hours).  Saturday night, did dinner - fish stew and/or chili on rice.
Snoopy's recipe kicks ass!  Went to the camp fire, I won a nifty bus
keychain.  We sacrificed an engine case to the fire gods and all were
suitably impressed.  We walked up to the shed and the jam session
started.  Wife, daughter, & I walked up to the creepy Yes people.  Pete
came up too and after about 5 minutes Pete & I left.  Had all we could
stand.  Back to the Jam session and then it started to rain.  Back to
camp to secure stuff, Royce had already closed the Tinkertoy (thanks!!),
we stashed the rest of the stuff.  I climbed in and beat on my guitar
for a while till Sherry & Heed came back.  Steve came back, decided he
wanted to take a shower and left for another 4 hours.  Talked for a
while & went to bed.

Sunday.  The rain started about 4:30 and was kinda steady all morning.
I threw the stuff in the tinkertoy, drove her up to the shed to repack.
The rest of the Full Moon contingent soon arrived and we repacked, Pete
got a valve adjust & retorque, I opened the heater box for defrost and
we went to Honey's restaurant for brunch.  Honey wasn't wearing any
panties that I could see.  Enjoyed breakfast and off to the next fuel
stop.  We decided to take back roads back (my fault, sorry guys).  1
wrong turn, but a quick realization of this, stopped to ask directions
and then we were running'  I didn't know there were so many little towns
this that many stop lights in rural North Carolina.  Derek's bus threw
it's only wiper arm.  We did lots of stop and stop driving until we got
S of rt 85.  Then we made good and uneventful time the rest of the way
back.

THANKS TO ALL WHO MADE THIS A GREAT WEEKEND!!  The shirts rule Doc!</pre>
