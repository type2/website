   <h1>My little weekend jaunt in the bus.</h1>
   <b>&quot;No Quarter&quot; &lt;silent_at_beatricene_dot_com&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2000-09-25 01:44:30+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>I decided to go on a little weekend excursion.  I ended up putting on 252
miles.

I left Saturday morning for the little town of Brownville, NE located along
the Missouri river about 70 miles East of me.  Every year this time they
have a big flea market and the historicity and beautiful scenery of the
small town makes it a natural location for such an event.  Brownville is the
first town to have been settled in Nebraska back in the 1850's but it's
history goes back a few years prior to that.  Not until 1970 was the whole
town put on the historical register and surprisingly despite a hundred or so
years passing between it's founding and it's inductance into the register,
many of the original buildings still stood including the jail which is
nothing more than a metal cage outside where you sit and get humiliated by
your being exposed to the public. :-)

I didn't find a heck of a lot of stuff.  I did end up buying a box of
assorted 1950's thru 1960's Popular Mechanix and Popular Science mags for
$25 (more on this later) and an original VW postcard with a nice photo of a
family in a ragtop bug.  The card was mint until I somehow mulched the
corner of it (DAMN!)  I met up with Judith Noah, the previous owner of my
bus and was able to give her her first ride in her old bus in over 4 years.
I let her drive it and although she had a little trouble with the manual
trans after being away from it so long, she thoroughly enjoyed putting
around for a couple of blocks on the backroads of Brownville.  Not many
people get the priviledge to drive their old rides after they've been sold.

Not long after I had arrived at Brownville, I bumped into listee Glen Hadley
in his 79 Westy  just as he and his family were departing.  We had intended
to meet  there in the morning sometime and with my later arrival and his
obligations, we spoke for a few minutes - just long enough to make
arrangments for supper and for Glen to show me his $75 table top bushing
lathe he bought.  By the time I stumbled across the guy who had the lathes,
he was all out!  DOH!

After filling myslef on funnel cakes, lemonade, BBQ Pork, and kettle corn
(made the old way with oil and suger (YUM!)), I decided to head out to
Hamburg, IA about 20 miles up I-29 to Glen's house.  Glen had attended a
company picnic in Nebraska City in the afternoon and had said that around
5:00 he would be home.  I had called his cell and there was no answer so I
assumed he'd still be at the picnic.  Much to my surprise, the family was
already at home when I showed up (should of called the home number!).  I got
to meet Ben, Ephram, (Glen's sons) and his wife Arian.  As is the case with
the listees I've met, they're all good folks and I enjoyed my little 3 hour
visit with them.  Glen provided a snack supper consisting of whatever he had
available in the fridge 'n' freezer so we all got a little of this and
little of that.  I found it a very nice break from what I normally end up
doing while on the road so many thanks to Glen and family for the eats and
association.  I was also pleased to meet Glen's workmate (forgot his name),
his wife and daughters.  Both Glen and his buddy work at the Cooper Nuclear
Power Plant just outside of Brownville along the Missouri River.  Glen can
talk all this lingo involved with nuclear reactors like I talk about VWs.
I'm glad our reactors are in the hands of guys such as Glen.  :-)

After a nice chat with Ephram about lego engines and VWs, I decided it was
time to head up to Rob Laffoon's in Omaha about 65 miles away.  Glen and
Ephram had helped me Rain-X my windshields so I could see through the
sprinkles that permeated the weekend here and there so I was set.  I bid my
company farewell, fueled up at the first gas station and headed up I-29 to
Omaha.  I followed a train along the road for a while, saw a few cars here
and there.  Got passed by a few semi's and drove through rain and dry spots.
It was really dark out there along I-29 - no small towns along the road like
I'm used to in Nebraska - it was kind of  a scary and forlorn sort of ride
when I was by myself (I need a cruising companion!) putting along.  I drove
my fears away by listening to the 6v AM radio to KWBE 1110.  The Michael
Medved show was on and he just talks about everything under the sun.  He was
criticizing some new movie about homeless people where a guy from London
lives with the homesless in the Subway tunnels for 2 years.  Of course the
phone lines were jammed in response to his public critique but by the time
they took calls, I round Rob's house.  Justin was outside riding his little
aluminum Razor scooter and as usual, I was welcomed like a minor hero, had
my stuff carried in for me, and was made to feel right at home.</pre>
