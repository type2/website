   <h1>Doin' stuff to the bus.</h1>
   <b>&quot;No Quarter&quot; &lt;silent_at_beatricene_dot_com&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2001-01-07 01:28:20+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Well today was a really nice day outside.  Well over half of the accululated
snow has melted off and kind of formed half-breed snow/ice piles (sn'ice)
all over the place.  The thaw has been nice enough that I was even able to
push an 8" thick slab of clear ice that measured roughly 4 foot square off
the of roof at work (the area directly above our kerosene heater.)

Last time I looked today, the temps were in the low 50's so I decided to
fire up the old bus and drive it around and see if I felt like doing
maintenance to it.  I took a little 15 to 20 mile jog north of town and back
on the 4 lane highway.  It's kind of my testing grounds.  If I can get my
project to a little town north of here and back, then it'll probably make a
farther trip okay.

After rolling into the driveway, I decided the time was right so I worked on
changing the oil.  It took about 6.5 quarts to fill the system.  The new oil
filter went on okay and the weight of the old one was testament to the fact
that it had indeed been filtering the contaminants out.  I couldn't believe
just how nice the oil looked - I am used to the black color of oil at 1500
mile intervals on the Super Beetle.  Poking around in the engine compartment
and toasting off a can of brake cleaner to tidy things up, I found out the
reason for my fast idle - a broken return spring on the right carb.  I was
able to fix that in a jiffy and now my bus idles nice and slow again.  I
also put in a different op sender unit and this time, to test my suspicions
as to what exactly was causing the oil leak around the OP area, I made a
little gasket to fit around the threaded portion of the sending unit.  As a
test drive later indicated, a lot of the oil I was loosing was not coming
from sender itself, but from around the threads and seeping out.  When the
case was originally drilled and tapped for the OP unit (this was a T3 case
originally), the bore was just tad oversize and my powerful wrench hand damn
near bottomed the sender out.  Well now it has bottomed out but thankfully
it hasn't cracked the boss.  Making a gasket and then using liberal amounts
of green loctite and gaskasinch has all but elimated the oil leak from the
OP area.  Now there is still a persistant trickle from the distributor base
though.  That one is kind of weird because I put in a new o-ring at BNNTA in
Septermber 2000 and although it helped, it didn't elimate the problem.

After that was fixed, I turned my attention to the linkpins.  It's nice
being able to be on this side of things and telling all of you about
adjusting linkpins.  In the early days of the list, I remember people
talking about it but never knew what they meant.  Now I know. :-)  I slid
under the bus and loosed the 4 hold down bolts and backed the pins off.
Then I grabbed the grease gun and it was empty.  Darn.  Put a new plug in
the moped and stripped out some more threads so I took off the crush washer
to get a bite on a couple more threads and success was mine!  After
adjusting the carb and grabbing my helmet, I sped on down to the local
O'Reilly auto parts store which just opened yesterday and finally, I found a
supplier of Stalube GL-4.  I of course sung their praises on that stuff and
while I was singing, grabbed a couple tubes of quality red grease.  My
grandfather always insists on red or blue grease so "you can see the dirt
coming out" as you pump the new stuff in.

Amidst a cacaphony of laughter behind me from customers walking in the
store, I put on my helmet, tied my sack of grease to the handlebars, and ran
my overall strap through the handle on the sta-lube and I was off.
Necessity IS the mother of all invention and it sure can be a mother
alright.  I made it back okay and loaded up the grease gun.  Started pumping
away on the front end - trying to grab all 18 zerks.  The swing arm pin zerk
was loose and about ready to fall out so I removed it and put a new one in.
They used to throw zerks away by the gallon can full at the drive line parts
place I use to work at back in 95 and 96 so I grabbed a few and saved them.
They came in handy today!  I finally got the whole front end greased
including the clutch pedal arm bushing. (Back when I was doing the front end
work in April of '00, I drilled a hole up through the frame to the clutch
arm bushing and installed a copper pipe with a zerk in each end.  I drilled
into the clutch arm bushing and tapped a hole so a zerk would fit.  Now when
I grease the front end, the most often used pedal of the cluster gets fresh
grease!  This way I don't have to pull off the splash pan and disassemble
that clutch pedal assembly.  Man that worked great - I knew I had at least
done one thing right!)

Next I tightened up the linkpins then backed them off just a hair.  The
grease popped and snapped in disgust letting me know I had pumped in a good
fresh supply.  I tightened up the securing bolts and let her down off the
jackstands.</pre>
