   <h1>Another Junkyarding story.</h1>
   <b>&quot;No Quarter&quot; &lt;silent_at_beatricene_dot_com&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1999-06-10 00:21:12+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>I've had quite an awesome day.

It started out with a trip to Lincoln (40 miles one way) to go pick up my
engine I'm going to use for my bus.  The bill was $57 (OUCH!) for the insert
on #4 and to drill and tap the OP sensor hole ($50 labour and $7 parts) but
you know, I couldn't have done it myself confidently.  When I got there,
they told me drive on inside the shop (this is Olston's Import Auto in
Lincoln, NE - my #1 favourite VW shop - they are pricey but damn they are
good!) to get the engine.  It fit perfectly in the trunk area but I had to
remove the alt/gen stand first.  It was kind of neat - having cars on the
lifts around me with mechanics working on them, and me right in the middle
doing my thing.  I fit right in (except for the overalls and bandanna.) :-)
The effect of having a lowered SB was quite evident with the long block
sitting on the spare tire up front.  I REALLY liked that look and man did
the bug ever handle great in the headwind.  Lowering a front end is really a
neat performance mod that should be looked into.  It also makes your bug
look "mean." :-)  aka the Kuhn look. :-)  Oil temps were a solid 180 going
to Lincoln and coming back, in a strong headwind with the pedal floored
repeatedly to climb hills to maintain 65mph, temps never saw anything over
200.  This is good. (we had 3 grown people in the bug too!)

I picked up me mum and sister for lunch and parked next to a yellow water
beetle in the lot (which turned a lot of heads.)  With that completed, my
sister and I headed over to Paneitz Salvage in Fairbury, NE.  Man it's been
well over a year since I was there and just darn near all of the VWs over
there haven't been touched since I was there!!!  I mean there is still an
old 6v truck generator sitting on the top of a shelled out splitty.  There
is still a bay window bus dash with 12v sapphire radio (complete with knobs
and speedo) laying right where I left it over a year ago (inside of a home
made double cab (which used to be a Westy), and in the same bus, are a bunch
of bay window rims and a big plastic water tank that says "Campmobile" in
raised letters on the side.  It also has 2 brass female connections on the
bottom as if to be used for a water tank of some sort.  I feel so fortunate
to have access to such a great yard!

Since I've dangled the carrot of the junkyard saga in front of you all, I
must tell another part of this story first.

When I got to Fairbury (FBY), I saw a nice little green bug head over to the
Walmart (just off the highway) and since I was dropping off my sister there
to shop, I figured I'd follow the guy and chat with him.  We had a real nice
chat (as the oil temp climed up to 205 due to heat saturation (90F by this
time)) and he told me about living in California and Hawaii.  Within the
first few minutes, we hit it off real good because we both knew what we were
talking about (he actually knew about having to adjust the valves and the
Idiot book.)  We idle chatting for a spell, and after bidding each other
farewell, I headed for Paneitz Salvage.  I happened to look in the rearview
mirror and he was flagging me down.  Oh great - I though I dumped some oil
or had a fire brewing.  When I backed up he asked me if I was interested in
a "header."  He said it was brand new (don't they all say that.)  I agreed
to meet him later to see it despite my skepticism.

Onward ho to Paneitz Salvage.  The first bug I saw was a 68 or 69
autostick - complete but desperatelyin need of some TLC.  The radio was gone
and where the antenna was supposed to be was a chrome block off plate.  I
started to take the block-off plate off because I thought it was quite a
neat rarity.  The owner, Vern, came out and said the bug was sold already.
I humbly apologized and moved on my way.  There is quite a bit of dub stuff
around.  There are only 2 baywindows busses in the hard that I know of and 2
splitties.  Both splitties have uncut dashes.  These would be worth cutting
out for someone who needs to repair their mutiliated spiltty dash.  The one
bus has the old spoon latches on the windows despite the plastic knobs being
in sorry shape.  The home made double cab (mentioned above) has quite a bit
of goodies in it yet - 2 12v sapphires, a belly pan, some bones from a cow
or horse with grateful dead stuff on it (weird), and modern 5 lug rims,
spare dash, and a campmobile water tank (I assume) in wonderful shape.  I
was able to snag a 74 Super wiper motor in anticipation of my 12v conversion
on my 66 splitty.  I located 3 wiper assembled in my basement this morning -
one is from a 72 or so bay window bus and the other 2 are from later
standard beetles.  I wasn't sure if the super/std. motors were the same so I
coughed up $25 for this motor out of the 74 Super (which obviosuly was
burnt.)  Despite the motor being covered by a sheet of melted plastic (which
actually protected it), it still ran when I tested before leaving.  It looks
just like the motor from a std. bug wiper assembly but still, since the
instructions from www.acvwjyro_dot_com specify a super beetle motor on a bay
window assembly, I bought this one.  I'll compare it to what I have and post
the info to the list.</pre>
