 I need advice.
 My '66 bus stopped running about 8 months ago and I just can't 
 get it to start.
 
 Summary: Parked it in garage in January or February (had been 
 running OK). 2 or 3 weeks later, even after a battery charge, 
 the engine would only turn over very, very slowly. Since then, 
 after replacing starter, clutch (which it needed), and getting a 
 new battery (system is still 6V), it still turns over very, very 
 slowly and can't start the engine.
 
 Details:
 
 I'm hoping that you diagnosticians out there will see this as a 
 challenge! :)
 
 The first 3 years I lived here in North Carolina I didn't have a 
 garage. I noticed that if I let the bus sit over a week, I might 
 not be able to start it again. Even after charging the battery. 
 In general, I *could* get the engine to turn over just fine, but 
 it wouldn't catch. I would get it started eventually (this 
 problem happened a couple of times) only after replacing 
 something in the electrical system: the spark plug cables or the 
 condenser. Maybe they were just old.  The coil is also pretty 
 recent.
 
 The distributer cap and rotor are, perhaps, a little older, but 
 look OK visually.
 
 By January 2000 I was living in a house with a garage, and I 
 guess I thought my problems might be over (when I lived in Texas 
 with the bus in a garage, I could let it sit a week and get it 
 going again just fine and it would run well, so I figured 
 keeping it dry and warm would make it happy).
 
 But after letting it sit a couple of weeks in early February, it 
 would barely turn over. Well, the battery was a little old. I 
 charged it, but still it would barely turn over. Since the 
 battery was a "42" month model and I'd had it maybe 6 years 
 plus, I just went ahead and bought a new one.
 
 One possible problem: I got the new one at a sleazy independent 
 VW garage--yes, there are such places :-(  It could have been in 
 stock for years or taken out of something else and cleaned up to 
 look new.
 
 After installing it, the engine still just barely turned over.
 
 It turns over sort of irregularly:
 grunt...grunt...[pause]...grunt,grunt [2-3 seconds]
 
 ... means a slight pause
 [pause] means a little longer
 it's not necessarily always the same pattern, but the point is 
 that it's not regularly turning over, but has irregular pauses 
 during the cycle.
 
 When I turn it over manually with the pulley, it seems to turn 
 over just like it always did. Nothing seems to be binding or 
 seized up.  Anyway, it had been running fine at the time I 
 parked it in the garage.
 
 The clutch was clearly trashed. It had been chattering, 
 grabbing, slipping, etc. I really had driven it way too long 
 since the symptoms had started, I admit, but had just been too 
 lazy to fix it.  Perhaps I had damaged the engine while 
 driving the clutch while it seemed to be slipping (periodic 
 times of extra low power). Since I decided that there must be 
 something wrong with the starter, and the clutch needed 
 replacing anyway, it was time to drop the engine.
 
 So I took the engine out, replaced the clutch, and (probably 
 stupidly) just replaced the starter with a rebuilt one without 
 getting the old one properly tested (a 6V starter will freak 
 out some shops). My parents got the car new in 1966 and I don't 
 have any record of the starter ever being replaced.
 
 Before putting the engine in the car, the starter kicked in just 
 great and spun around real fast, but of course there was no load 
 on it.
 
 After putting the engine back in, it still won't turn over 
 normally at all.  Grunt ... Grunt ... [Pause] ... Grunt, Grunt  
 It stops all together after you've gone through the cycle a few 
 times.
 
 I've charged the battery and tested it with one of those cheapie 
 rubber squeeze things you get at a FLAPS; for the liquid in all 
 the cells, the needle points to the border between good and 
 fair. I think this should be enough to turn the engine over 
 normally, even if slowly.  Not just grunt .... grunt  .
 
 If there were something wrong with the engine's ignition system, 
 it seems to me that it would turn over fast, like it always did 
 a couple of years ago, even when I couldn't start it. That made 
 me think that the problem was in the:
 
 battery
 battery cables (seem just fine from visual inspection)
 starter
 
 Other than than, it might turn over slowly if something were 
 binding in the engine, but it was running OK when I drove it 
 last into the garage.
 
 Question:
 Will it not start even if the battery is good or even 
 if you use the high amp start mode on the charger if there's 
 something wrong with the voltage regulator or anything else in 
 the electrical system? I didn't think this came into play since 
 the solonoid/starter got juice directly from the battery during 
 starting.
 
 Also, I do have one of those low-voltage relays that you use so 
 the solonoid doesn't need to get juice that goes all the way 
 from the ignition switch. (Ignition switch throws the relay, 
 which opens the circuit from battery to solonoid, which then can 
 do its thing.) I've tried it with this hooked up as well as with 
 it not hooked up (in the stock manner, with the solonoid 
 activated directly from the starter switch); either way the 
 solonoid kicks in, but the starter just goes grunt ... grunt .
 
 The engine has about 80,000 miles on it, but was running OK the 
 last time I parked the car and turned it off.
 
 Any advice for further diagnosis would be appreciated.
 
 Thanks,
    Mark, markt_at_duke_dot_edu
 
Sounds to me like the starter is screwed up, maybe the bushing that goes into 
the flywheel. It's just a small fix that you can get to by removing the 
starter and feeling up in the hole what shape the bushing is in. You can back 
it off with a screwdriver and replace it so that the starter doesn't drag.

A dragging starter will sound like it's about to quit whenever it turns over. 
Once fixed, it will turn over fine. I have a Type 34 Ghia that acted that 
way. I was using a 12-volt battery on a 6-volt starter system. It dragged all 
the time. After replacing the bushing that the starter fits into (about a 
1/2" x 3/4" bushing, which was wallowed out) the starter now turns over 
smoothly and rapidly. Don't worry, the 12-volt battery on a 6-volt system 
just turns the car over a little faster, has been that way for two years, and
is the prescribed method of fixing the starter on a Type 34 Ghia (otherwise 
one would have to replace the flywheel, if he could find one). For the length 
of time that the starter is engaged, there is no bad effect.
