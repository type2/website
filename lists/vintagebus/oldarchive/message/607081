   <br/>
   <pre>I was taking apart a motor the other day.   It used to be in a friend of
mine's 60 doublecab.   After she bought the truck I did a tune up on it, and
changing oil cleared a lot of guck out and it suddenly developed a yucky
amount of end play.   Watch out for that I said.  May not last long, but it
does sound good.    She merrily drove it around for a while, and moved up to
the Columbia basin, a couple hours upstream of Portland Oregon.     The motor
died one day , and she found a motor here in Oly, which I agreed to deliver to
her (this was a year ago last summer), as I was going down to P town and I
thought it'd be nice to go east of the cascades and do a little junkyarding in
the dry rust free zone.   So I loaded the motor in my 65 westy, and ended up
back in oly some days later with her dead motor.

So I dragged it out of the pile the  other day.   At some point I had already
removed the heads.   I had put the good generator/distributor and some other
bits onto other cars.  A friend helped me put it on the workbench on some
cardboard.    Eek, oil drips out of the push rod tube holes, so up on some
4x4s, a pan underneath and drain the oil.  After that, back on the bench.
Number 4 piston didn't move when I turened the crankpulley, and there was a
stuck spot.  It was really difficult to get the cylinders off, so I ended up
bashing the gajeebaws out of them and the fins off them, which didn't matter
as they were toast.   One was really warped, and getting it off the piston
left a nice deep scrape/gouge down the inside of the cylinder.    The #4 rod
was warped, had come off the crank and was what broke the hole in the top off
the case.     Even the nut that had come unscrewed looked flattened.   The cap
had bent around backwards.     So it was all just cause a rod cap nut came
loose.  ( makes me think why did the nut come loose?   Was it all just not
torqued, or did it get really hot which loosen the nuts?)   With the p's and
c's off I could see  mass metal hairs in the case.   Wads of it.  I tried to
burn it with the propane torch, but got bored.   with rags spread around handy
to catch more oil, I removed all the case nts and bolts (the big ones were at
about 12 ft pounds), managed to get the crank pully off, un screwed the rear
tin, and pulled the oil pump and the sump plate.      tried to bang the case
apart, the seam opened a tad only.  Found another nut hidden under the dirt,
undid it and then the case came apart.

Thunk thunk thunk thunk out come the guts.   Where is the cam?  
Here and here and here and here.  Four pieces.  Egads. 

  The thrown rod had attacked the opposite side of the case, chewing it up and
making loads of metal hairs out of the case metal.   it also mashed where one
of the lifters went, jamming it in place (the top broke off that lifter) and
I figure it may have caused the camshaft damage by trying to push a lifter
that just wasn't going to lift.

so, do listen if your motor starts making funny noises.   When a rod comes
loose you can hear it.   I have hears that noise three times.  The time I was
driving and heard the sudden loud tatatatatattatatat especially when letting
up on the gas I pulled off the freeway, stopped, refused to drive it or start
it again and we had to be rescued (thanks Eric and Barb) (That motor when
taken apart had spun a rod bearing- the nice AK case got rebuildt and is now
in my 61) and the next a neighbor was trying   to start a motor that just
wasn't going to keep running and sounded really bad-  we heard it and looked
over... that bus sounds like a  carp I said,  it's gonna throw a rod,  my then
boyfriend said run over and tell him I said,  but thunk it went and didn't go
round no more.    You just threw a rod we yelled.   Third time someone was
starting up a bus and it sounds awful, had those metal knocking against each
other noises, don't think you should drive it, i'd shut it off I said, just
moving it a little way he said,  sounds real bad I said,   it'll be okay  he
said,  thunk the motor said, stuck.    Read the expensive noises bit in the
idiot book.     The thrown rod kills a case, and this time even a camshaft.
It was a dual relief later alloy universal case, too bad.
