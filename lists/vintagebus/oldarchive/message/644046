   <h1>10-16-99 Progress on the 66 bus. (long)</h1>
   <b>&quot;No Quarter&quot; &lt;silent_at_beatricene_dot_com&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1999-10-17 03:48:46+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Today was a cooler day than it has been in southeast Nebraska.  We had been
having unseasonably warm weather with daily temps in the high 70's and even
an 80 here and there.  I decided to sleep in a bit and lollygag around the
house in order to let things warm up outside.

Around 10:30 I went down to the local Tractor Supply Company (midwest chain)
and bought a wire wheel for the grinder.  I had worn mine down to about 1/8"
of stubble. :-)  Then I slipped on over to our new AutoZone which hasn't
even been open a week.  I've delivered a lot of materials over to this place
while it was being built. Now it's great to walk in and be able to have tons
more options available to me on the fly than ever before in this town of
13,000 people. It will compliment our Walmart well. :-)  Today was grand
opening at the AutoZone so I got a free hotdog and pop - nice touch.  One
thing I found so amazing at this place was that when I was asked what I was
looking for, I told them I needed tranny fluid for a 66 VW Van (terms such
as microbus, transporter, and kombi seem to throw the average 'Joe' off).  I
stated that I needed to check my shop manual as I didn't know what fluid was
proper to use - the 80w-90 or the 85w-140.  They hustled me over to a
computer, selected the year 1966, then Volkswagen, then Volkswagen Truck,
and then Transporter and there it was - a full spec sheet which they printed
out for me.  It told the engine size (1493cc 1.5L), single bbl. carb, the
fluid of choice, and the total capacity.  This was totally amazing to me
since I'm used to all the local places at times not having references in
their books showing that a VW Bus even existed.

I made my home and stopped at a garage sale where I used to see an old man
every day and I'd wave and smile as I drove by - he'd always return the
courtesy.  Turns out, the kids chucked him in a home and were selling off a
bunch of his stuff.  I bought Marty's old gas can, a couple metal files, a
machinist's ruler, and an old suitcase which I'm going to use to pack my
clothes in when I head to California.  It's older than the bus is but it'll
be a nice touch.  The garage sale spilled into the house so I walked inside
and saw a shelf full of books - many of which were related to nursing.
Marty's wife must have been a nurse at one time.  I did start to wonder when
I saw 3 books related to "Everything you Ever Wanted to Know about Sex" next
to his Catholic Devotionals but I digress.  I'll miss seeing the old guy - I
kind of wished I would have stopped and talked to him just once because now,
I'll never get the chance.  I did tell his kids to make sure and pass it
along that the guy in the little red Volkswagen bug said, "Hello" - I want
him to know that I didn't forget him. :-)

I was ready to get to work so when I got home, that's what I did.  I had
parts hanging around the shop like some kind of modern art display left from
last night's painting marathon.  I got the tranny carrier bolted on along
with the mounts.  I installed the new bowden tube from Ronnie and when I
went to checking the clutch cable - the old one is a helluva lot thicker
than the replacement.  It still looks like it's in good shape so I might
just leave it alone.  After hooking up my wire wheel, I derusted a ton of
bolts, washers, and nuts that I would need to have ready upon installation
of the transaxle assembly.  Summoning the help of my brothers, we manhandled
the rear end into the bus and soon found out that trying to get the spring
plate on the reduction box was major pain in the rear end!!!  I soon settled
on the idea of using a huge C-Clamp to draw the plate up to the box and it
was like night and day difference - the bolts went in so much easier.  No
wonder so many of these boxes are stripped out - matter of fact, my one
whole box is a bundle of helicoils but they held okay - lord help me if I
ever have to pull them off again.

The rest of the afternoon was spent torqueing bolts to spec., putting the
drums on (just so I don't have to leave them laying on the bench while I
wait for the brake parts to arrive.)  This evening I went back to AutoZone
and wonder of wonder, they just happened to have 2 shocks in stock for the
rear end!  They come with some kind of a warranty where no matter where I
am, if there is an Autozone, they'll replace them in the event of failure -
right on!

To cap off the evening, I poured in a cup of fluid in each reduction box and
worked the fluid around by turning the drum.  Since it was getting really
cool out and the fluid poured like honey, I decided to wait and fill the
tranny tomorrow.  So far, the boxes aren't leaking but the real test comes
when the tranny is filled.  My fingers are crossed. :-)</pre>
