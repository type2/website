   <h1>Story of the Shorty Bus.</h1>
   <b>&quot;John Flowers&quot; &lt;flowersj_at_gallatinriver_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2000-12-04 05:02:34+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>A couple of years ago a friend told me about a shorty split that was parked
in a bus garage near my house. The owner of the shorty was a tour coach
operator hauling people back and forth to the local casino, shopping trips
to the mall etc..
I went over and looked at the bus when I first found out about it and came
home pretty depressed. Here was a '60 Standard that someone had cut the
center section out of then welded back together. Standard shoretning
procedure, just take out the doors and weld up the two sections and you have
an instant 48" wheelbase tall narrow bus, something that would make you
yearn for the stability of a Ford Bronco or Suzuki Samurai when you turned a
corner. He and his partner planned on shortening the bus, painting it up
like one of their motor coaches and running it around in parades as an
advertisement, but he got on to other things and the old bus has sat in the
same spot for 12 years or so, with motor coach parts stored on top of it and
stuff inside.
Two years ago, when I first saw it I called him at home and he wasn't
interested in selling it, didn't really even want to talk to me about it, I
guess I just caught him near the phone.

Thursday night he left me a voice mail "If you're the same guy that was
interested in my shortened VW bus, please give me a call."
Well I let a day go by but my curiousity got the best of me and I called him
back. A short conversation led to an appointment to see the old bus and we
got together on Saturday afternoon. My wife INSISTED on coming along, for
obvious reasons I guess, after all, it's three weeks before Christmas, we're
a little "short" if you'll pardon the term on spending money and the
driveway is full to the point of me manually rotating the non-running VW's
in and out of the driveway and street in front of my house to make it look
as if they're coming and going as casually as any neighbor's daily drivers.
Arnold (the owner) met us at the garage and as he turned on the lights he
gave me the story that all of us hears at one time or another,
"She ran when we parked it here, still has oil in the crankcase, gas in the
tank, even the battery's still there." In fact, the key was still in the
ignition. I could see it after several minutes of moving tour bus parts and
crates out of the way. What I uncovered, when the driver's side was finally
free was a bus that's had at least the bottom third caked with bondo, and it
didn't take a handy pocket magnet to find out either.
This stuff was trowled on in that swirled pattern so popular with stucco
ceilings. One sliding window was busted, one popout, the remaining window on
the drivers side was missing entirely, the bumpers are gone, the hubcaps and
clips, the tires are flat, one wiper is missing, the outriggers on the frame
are shot through, I could go on and on but you all get the picture. This
poor beater was crusher bait 15 or so years ago when the two "customizers"
got to it. Interior's gone, seats are springs and back ones are missing
entirely, as is the headliner, kick panels and of course the middle two feet
or so of the bus, let's not forget that.
I give the bus a good look-over and figure that if he "gives" the bus to me
there's probably some stuff that could be salvaged before the body is sent
to the big sleep. After all, there's a motor, small nut tranny, etc. etc. on
down to the fridge handle door pulls and the 70 mph speedo stuff like that.
So I ask Arnold, "What would you like to have for it?" He says, "I'd like to
get just what I've got into it" then a looooong pause and he says  "I'd like
to get 3" My wife and son, even my seven year old daughter are all
thinking...3 WHAT?? but not me, nooooo not the George Castanza of the
midwest, I'm a man of the world, been around the block, you don't need to
explain anything to me "3" I say Arnold deadpans back to me "3". I look back
at Arnold "3, 3's good , yeah, 3," (shaking my head) "3, I can believe 3"
Not having a clue in the world if this old guy actually believes this poor
thing is worth $3,000.00 as a priceless unfinished masterpiece or if he
realistically wants to recover a couple of hundred bucks and is ready to
negotiate down, is it unthinkable that he's going to turn over the title for
three portraits of Washington?? I am standing here in this dirty garage,
shaking my head at this old crusty experiment gone awry and muttering "3" as
if the very sound of the word will draw the remaining sylables from between
Arnold's stern, pinched lips. "3", the number hangs in the air like a Sesame
Street episode; "Today's adventure is sponsored by the letters V and W, and
the number 3."
Arnold didn't give an inch. I didn't know how to ask which particular
position in the area to the left of the decimal point Arnold's 3 was
cemented into. Finally, seeing no way short of actually asking which 3 he
had in mind I deflected the situation into a "I'll have to get back to you"
and finally shuffled out the door, family in tow. I shouldn't even call him
back, but I have this '56 that's in need of most of the stuff that shorty
still has and if there's any chance that I can drag it home for a reasonable
amount, well, that will put the '56 closer to the day we spin past Ronald
Reagan's boyhood home in sublime, aircooled fashion. In the meantime I have
to find out a way to weasel the answer out of Arnold without making him
think that 1. He's a lunatic for asking 3K (which he would be). or 2.
Encouraging him to step up to 3K if he's only got 300 in mind...
If you're still reading this, don't worry, I'll let you know when I find
out.
