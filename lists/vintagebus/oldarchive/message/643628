   <h1>The Turkis Turd goes to Detroit</h1>
   <b>&quot;Brian M. Wittling&quot; &lt;kdfmotors_at_primary_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1999-06-16 20:42:04+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>For as long as I've been into VW's, I've wanted to get up to the show in
Auburn Hills for the Volkswagen of America Headquarters show.   I'd see
pictures in the rags every year with lots of kewl stuff, and listen to the
stories of the rockin' good time had the night before with free eats and
beer provided by VW, live bands, etc.  Every year though, something would
keep me from going...  unable to get time off work, no money, bus broken,
etc.  So, with all this free time I've had lately, I vowed that this would
be the year I make it!  And with the 'Return to the Fatherland" tour
stopping buy, there couldn't be a better year to do it!

First order of business would be to whip the turkis Turd into shape...
there was no way I was going to trust that weak, overheating Single-Port
motor to make the trip (it would be about 1,200 miles round-trip).  I
decided to put the old Dual-Port engine back in, and just deal with the
herky-jerky ways of a DP motor for a little while longer.  I started on
Wednesday afternoon, and planned on leaving Friday.   I pulled the SP motor
out of the bus, and stripped it down, as I would be needing to use the
exhaust, fuel pump, some tin, etc from it on the new (old) engine.  I also
had to prep and paint several new pieces of tin, including a new fan housing
with working flaps, and head tin pieces.  With the motor out, I wriggled it
>from the jack and onto a big bucket to use as a platform for mantling.  I
managed to get the SP long block off, and the DP long block on the bucket by
myself.  As I was cleaning and assembling as much of the engine as I could,
I set about painting the new tin.  It was getting to be one of those typical
St. Louis 98% humidity days though, and after 10 hours under lamps and with
a fan blowing, the tin STILL wasn't dry!!   The fan housing was the worst..
still very tacky.  There were also other problems to contend with. I had to
wait until Thursday to run down to archway, as I was out of gasket sets, and
I needed a few other odds and ends that I didn't have on hand for a
dual-port.

So it's now Thursday afternoon, I've got a half-assembled motor, and I'm
still waiting for the fan housing to dry.  In a marathon overnight session,
I finished mantling the engine, complete with still sticky fan housing.  One
problem however, was that it was quite late when I finally finished the
engine, and I had no help to get the turn-key engine off the bucket and down
onto the jack!  So I developed an intricate contraption of old 2x4 scraps,
plywood and levers to get the motor off the bucket, and then dropped it on
the floor anyway...  I also got quite anal with the fit of the tin, and even
went to Home Depot for foam insulating tape to refurbish the foam around the
oil cooler, and seal up the tin around it.   I got the motor in, all the
electrical hooked back up, the throttle and heat cables, ducts, air cleaner,
and so on.  At 3 AM, I finally set out on a victory test drive.  20 miles on
the highway revealed great power, and my heads never went over 350 degrees,
and my oil was running a full 40 degrees cooler than it used to in this
engine with all the tin sealed up nice and neat!

Back home I began packing, gave the dog a bath, as he would be going with me
on this journey, did some last minute laundry, and get as much as I could
into the bus. With that all said and done, I grab a quick nap for a couple
hours, and head out to the grocery store, and run a few errands before I
leave.  My plans were to catch up with the Fatherland tour guys and the DBG
in Kalamazoo that night, and figure things out from there.  I knew some
folks were planning on camping at Pontiac Lake recreation area, so I could
always catch up with them there.

I finally got on the road, and out of St. Louis about 1:00PM.  Weather was
cloudy and overcast, but at least it was cool out.  At about 4 or 5 though,
things really cleared up, and got a little warm out in the sun.  I was
making pretty good time, being able to sustain 60mph quite easily now, and
even found a couple of semi's driving rather conservatively, and was able to
draft them for quite  a while.  I appeared to be getting great gas mileage
too!   Just south of the Chicago area, I stopped for my 1st fill up, and I
was getting about 25mpg! Woohoo!!  Happy days are here again!   I arrived in
the Chicago area about 6PM, in near record time for me, and just in time for
Friday night rush-hour traffic.  The tollway into Indiana was the worst of
it, driving for I would guess 10 miles or more in 1st gear only, and for no
apparent reason... no accidents or nothing were to be seen.

I stopped for a light dinner (tuna salad and crackers) at the Michigan
welcome center about 8PM.  ( I hadn't realized yet that I had crossed into a
new time-zone).  After un-tangling the dog from a light post he had wrapped
himself around a few dozen times, I set back on the journey.  My plans were
to hopefully meet up with the Fatherland Tour folks in Kalamazoo, where they
were staying at a hotel that wasn't on any of my maps.  Well, Kalamazoo came
and went, and I never saw any signs or anything for the elusive hotel.  I
decided the best course of action would be to drive past Kalamazoo and stay
at a rest area for the night, and surely I would catch them in the morning
when they drove past.</pre>
