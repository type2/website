   <h1>The Southern Saga - Part 6: EVERYBUS!</h1>
   <b>&quot;Brian M. Wittling&quot; &lt;kdfmotors_at_primary_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1999-04-30 07:00:46+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>It is now around 8:30 Friday night, inauguration day for the first ever
Everybus -Type2_dot_com camping event.  Dave, Jonathan, George, the Mini-vanites
and I have just completed one hell of a good days worth of driving.  My ass
hurts, my knee hurts (motorcycle accident when I was 18), my eyes are tired,
the bus is tired.  The 1st person to greet us turns out to be Chris, the
event organizer.   Chris was quite jovial, and explained the fees, where to
park for each, the conveniences, etc.  I did my best to be cordial, but at
that point all I could think was "Just tell me where the hell to park!"
<grin>.  Dave and I made a round of the camping loop to prospect for a site,
and eventually pulled into the center loop opposite the fire place exposure,
and the 'stink-foot' encampment.  It was a good deal away from everyone
else, but not so far as to exclude us from the event.

In the dark, as best I could tell it was quite a nice little camping loop.
It was arranged in a big circle, with all the sites forming the perimeter
having electric and water(?) hookups, and the grassy area in the center was
for more primitive and/or tent camping.  In the very center of the loop, was
a very large public pavilion, with a stone fireplace, and lots of picnic
tables.  It all seemed very well kept, and in great condition.  There were a
few trees scattered about, but mostly we were in a giant clearing, with 95%
or so of the trees surrounding the loop.  Nearly all of the electric sites
appeared to be taken, and the area in front of the fireplace was heavily
encamped as well.

With our parking places chosen, it was time for me to get to work setting up
my new German Reimo camping tent purchased from fellow Missouri Micro Steve
Lashley. I bought it back in December or something as a Christmas gift to
myself, and this would be its maiden usage!  Setting it up in the dark was a
bit of a challenge, but the frame assembly is really quite self-explanatory
once you get all the poles laid out in front of you.  The hard part was
figuring out the canvas.. which way was front, etc. since I had never
unpacked it before.  It took the help of Dave to get it draped over the
frame properly, but, I'd say in no longer that 15-20 minutes, I had a very
nice, and very large side tent attached to my bus!  Whew!  Time to bust out
with the brews!

The poison of choice was some fine Irish Stout brought with me from St.
Louis,  and it didn't take long before I was 'feeling no pain'  ;-)   Almost
as soon as I got the tent set up, long-time friend and fellow photographer
Neil Pickett arrived, directly from Kelly's shop after a long days work on
his 58 deluxe, "Edward".  I know Edward very well.  It was that very bus
Neil was driving when we 1st met, many moons ago at the 1st ever "Busses by
the Arch".  I was, oh, about 18 or 19 then, and had just gotten back into
VW's after a several year hiatus.  Neil wasn't even with Mary Kay back
then...  I don't remember the name of the young lady with him, perhaps she's
off getting tetanus shots somewhere?   ;-)

Neil and I took some time to catch up, but we quickly moved on to other
socializing...  Neil and I would have plenty of time to visit later on...  I
am absolutely TERRIBLE with names, and I'm not that outgoing to begin with,
so I don't recall exactly who I met on that 1st night, other than Chris.
Sorry, but you folks know who you are!  ;-)  This was also a bit of an
unusual event for me in that there were not a lot of people I knew
beforehand there.  Usually I travel in a group of at least a few local
folks.  I spent most of the night hanging out with Dave, Jonathan and his
girl, and I remember admiring an exquisitely restored 13 window deluxe which
had bodywork done by Kelly.  The broad side of this bus was SO STRAIGHT, you
could have shaved yourself with an old-fashioned straight-razor in the
shine!  It was better than factory!  I also recognized quite a few faces
>from the Blue Ridge campouts, but like I said, I'm terrible with names.. the
only one DO remember for sure was Judy Neville.. and that's prolly because
at nearly every Blue Ridge campout she always seems to end up at a site
directly across from me ;-)

So, for the most part, I spent what was left of the evening enjoying my
Irish Stout, and listening to all the bus banter going on.  It was oh, I'd
say about 1 or 2 AM when I finally headed for the comfort of my SO-33 bed,
when I happened to look up at the sky while walking through the clearing.  I
was in awe.  It wasn't quite the best gazing I'd ever seen, but it was hell
of a lot better than the array of stars we get to see here in the urban
lights of St. Louis.  Blue Ridge is VERY good, but most of the campground is
under the forest canopy, which does not lend itself to star-gazing.  But
here I was, standing in this clearing, staring up in the sky in slack-jawed
wonder. It was perfectly clear that night. And the clearing along with the
surrounding circular arrangement of trees around the perimeter, gave the
feel of looking right into a globular star-chart, or sitting under the dome
of the observatory where they project the stars in one of those 'shows' at
the planetarium.  It wasn't clear enough to see the milky way, or shooting
stars... hardly even clear enough to easily make out Ursa Minor for that
matter, but with a little concentration, I was able to make out all of the
major constellations of early spring. Bootes,  Leo, Cygnus, and all of Draco
were just a few of the more exciting to view for once. Mars, Neptune and
Uranus were also out.  Pluto would have just been inside the Constellation
Opiuchus as well, but it would have taken a pretty darned good telescope to
bring him out!  I went to sleep that night with the hatch-top wide open,
gazing out at the heavens above... I only wish the gazing were this good
>from the roof of the library at school last semester, when I took my course
in observational astronomy.  With a sky like this, I could have run through
the entire star catalog in one marathon-night session! BTW, if you own a
Palm Pilot, there is an INCREDIBLE star-gazing app you can download from
http://www.star-pilot_dot_com  I couldn't live without it!</pre>
