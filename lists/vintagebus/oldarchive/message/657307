   <pre>Hey all,
I got back from the Health Fest 2000 (aka buses nowhere near the arch)
last night around midnight....but was far too beat to write any trip
report.

I woke up around 8-9 AM on wednesday morning to get ready for the trip.
I crammed all of the goodies I could/wanted to into the bus and then
headed to meet up with some friends in the town where I used to live
about 30 miles south west of here.  We then proceeded to go to Milwaukee
for the AC/DC concert.  Great show!!  Angus was incredible....and when
isn't he really? ;-)
We then rode back from milwaukee to Ripon (where i used to live) so that
I could pick up the bus and drive to near Aurora, IL to meet up with
fellow DBGer Ben Hawley.  I left ripon at about 1:30 AM Thursday morning
and while heading down to Ben's place...something awful happened.  My
passenger says "I smell gas!"  This was about 5:00 AM on Hwy 36 (i
think). I immediately pull over and kill the motor and stop on the side
of the road.  In a mad rush I opened the cargo doors....grabbed a flash
light to see what was wrong... and opened the engine lid carefully.
Turns out the brass fitting into the carb where the gas line hooks on to
had popped out!!  I even checked it when I had the motor out!!  It
sprayed gas all over the passengers side of the engine compartment and
all over the passengers side head tin and fan shroud and heat
riser...etc etc.  There was this white gas vapor that, if ignited, could
probably have shot me and my friend right across the freeway blowing the
back end of the bus off.  BUT... I got LUCKY and no fire happened.  Some
guy in a Jetta with bikes on the top who had passed us earlier, but
stopped to get gas, pulled over to see if we were alright.  He was from
MN heading to Ohio or something like that.  He used to have a 68 bus he
said...thats why he pulled over.  VW people are just plain cool!  So...I
knurled the fitting...and tapped it back into the carb...and limped to
the Petro station about 15 miles down the road.  It was getting light by
then.  I got some brake cleaner and JB weld and proceeded to fix my
buses flaw in the parking lot.  I cleaned the area free of grease or
anything else with brake cleaner...and then applied JB weld and also
peened in the boss of the fitting with a hammer and screwdriver to
insure that the fitting would never come out again.
On the road again.... got to Ben's place at about 8:00AM and waited for
Chris and his family in his V'gon before we left.  In the mean time Ben
and I went grocery shopping and I went to the hardware store to get some
hose clamps and bailing wire.  I clamped the rest of my fuel lines and
then applied a safety wire to the fitting in the carb with the wire I
bought.  (it was thick enough that I could even make an accelerator
cable if i had to...i later found that i did indeed have a spare clutch
and acc. cable though...)  Loaded all of Ben's stuff in the bus...and
took off with Chris, his family, and us behind.  3 people and all their
stuff in a split gets it pretty loaded down.  We left around 12:30 and
met up with John Flowers in Dixon at the Hardees' there.  Ate some
grub...and then moved on.  About 50? miles out of Dixon John's shifter
coupling fails....so..i throw a vice grips on there...but its really
hard to shift with just a vice grips on there if its not *just* right we
found.  So...Chris towed him with his V'gon a little bit down this road
in the middle of nowhere to a gas station where John called one of his
buddies with a flat bed and he got towed home later.  (John later made
it to buses with him and his daughter in the new beetle)  We make it to
the campground late thursday night and I get some rest.  I'd been up for
40 or so hours straight I figured...  This was a campground right by the
group campground for buses.  So i get up friday...we get in the gates
after a little parking incident... and I park the bus next to a buddy of
mine from here in town.  I was talking with some other DBGers when I
heard this horride grinding and smashing sound.  I look over and this
V'gon is getting intimate with my bus.  Thats not right!  I was pretty
steamed...but the guy came over and apologized and later made up for
it.  Nothing too bad...but a little crease in my passengers side rear
corner by the wheel arch and battery tray.  I'm still a little urked
over that one.
All is well the rest of the weekend....except for the 105' heat every
day!!  Not so bad if it was just heat...but you could see the humid
haze.  I woke up and went to bed wet every night...even after repeated
showers.
NQ pulled in and I spotted him and knew it was him right away...as he
also knew who I was.  We got to talking and bs'ing some more and we took
a spin in his bus later.  WOW!  He even let me drive it! :-)  Every
penny stuck in that bus was worth it.  It drives like a dream.  After
driving his...mine just doesn't feel 'right' any more...if you know what
I mean?

I also met up with Shawn and Sarah with the 15 window...and tried
snaking his shift pattern shift knob off of him...but he wouldn't
budge...  so...he let me drive the bus to ease the pain :-)  Shawn and
Sarah are great people to be around...and a LOT of fun.  That hopefully
wasn't the last time I'll see them.  Although...the his and hers captain
america undergarments did scare me!  ;-)

I hung around with Kent for quite some time (15 window deluxe...the
logo'd one..also has the 56 sunroof at Kelly's) and we had some fun
together...he made me sit in his bus and play with the ambo fans.  I'm
sorry...but those things are overrated.  Just stick a knob with a red
light on your air vent cover plate if you wanna be kewl.  Those things
block more air than they move.  Too bad he had to leave early....

I met up with a lot of people I've been wanting to meet....or see
again.  Steve White, Rob Lafoon (spel?), Terry (forgot your last
name...sorry!), NQ, David Schwarze, Bill Bowman, the DBG clan, and some
of the missouri micros (great camp setup!), Shawn and Sarah, the list
goes on...

I took home a 67 2/3 middle seat, all clamps, and appropriate floor mat
(a nice donation from the guy that hit me), and a turkis split bus
"1500" decklid...and rid myself of a floor mat, a firemans mask
setup...and some other odds and ends.</pre>
