   <br/>
   <pre>A friend of mine organised a camping trip down near Ocean Shores.  She 
planned on being out there all week, and said come on out and join us.

Earlier in the week I felt sorry for anyone camping down by the sea, as it 
was windy and rainy, though not terribly cold.   Thursday it had kind of 
cleared up and I decided to go out on Friday.    Packed up stuff in the bus 
(that doesn't take long, throw some blankets in, packed a bag with fresh 
french bread andvarious food items, dont forget the coffee!, all right, 
keys,tickets,money- ready... left around 6:30 and headed out hwy 8 from Oly, 
through the trees.  Mostly Douglas Fir, and some clearcuts of course, It is 
about 60 miles to Aberdeen, across the base of the Olympic Penninsula, 
through the trees.  Not much in the way of towns.  It is kind of a gently 
winding up and down road.  Cruising the bus around 58, listening to my Guided 
by Voices tape, then after a bit switched to the radio,  The Seattle station 
faded out , and when I got to Aberdeen there was a billboard with the local 
classic buttrock station, KBTT  94.7 or whatever.  The road goes through 
town, then through Hoquim, no bypasses here.  we dont need no stinking 
bypasses.   At point you can see Grays harbor and stuff, and mud flats.  
finally get out of Hoquim, and now I am at the Pacific, actually see rolling 
waves come almost up to the two lane highway , hills on my right inland.  
Then the road turns and climbs up the hills, it's windy and I switch down to 
third gear.  The tree are most Yew now, which likes more water than there is 
in Oly (ha ha haha) and a few westernredcedar and douglasfir.  you really 
dont see barely any yew in oly.

it winds back down to by the sea, usually some trees between the road and the 
Pacific, but it can still be seen.   Take the turn to Ocean Shores, follow 
the directions down to the secret hidden campsite.    There was tarps strung 
up, and a couple tables and nice fire circle with benches made of driftwood 
around it.  Christian is there, said that William and Thomas were playing at 
the Shilo.  So after a bit I head back towards town to the Shilo where there 
is an excellent view over the sand dunes to the sea where the sun had just 
set but it wasn;t dark yet, and hung out for a couple hours listening to good 
live music.  Krista and I head back after that, stopped at the store and got 
a bottle of red wine, and went back to the campsite (Uncle Bob's) and 
Christian had the fire going and we did the camping thang.

In the morning it was time to go to the beach .  Turned out Christian surfs, 
and had brought an extra wetsuit and board, so I was all psyched, lets go!  
so after we had drunk our coffee (they hadn't any, so glad I brought some, we 
all needed coffee) and ate our toast and bagels and fruit we piled the gear 
in the bus and climbed in and drove down on to the beach and parked on the 
hard sand near the sea.  The extra suit was a bit hard to get into, as it was 
a guys suit, and not made for someone with hips, but I managed, and had 
bootiesand we went out for hours had so much fun I hadn't been in the ocean 
for so long.  There were a couple seals out there checking us out, and the 
waves were kind of funky cause sometimes they disappeared but it was good 
anyway, eventually I got out and 

even though it was grey all day it was warm like about 60 and the dry breeze 
from inland felt so good after unpeeling the suit and changing into dry 
clothes.    Krista was beach combing and finding stuff from Japanese boats 
that had washed up and we found lots of shells.  Christian came back from the 
sea (we saw him catch a few good waves) and he changed and broke out some 
munchies and I had some bananas and tangelos to share too. So hungry.   The 
wind turned around shortly and then it started drizzling, we piled back in 
the bus and went  back to the campsite and cooked up some asparagus and I had 
made plans for last night so I figured I would go soon, but not till eating 
asparagus yum yum yum!!! and they were packing up the campsite too

left about quarter to five and the bus just was jamming with that happy bus 
feeling.   Drove through town, and saw two VWs parked in front of the surf 
shop, a red bug and a faded velvet green splitty (westy windows I think)  
with old style WA plates.  cool beans.  just bebopped along listening to KBTT 
till about 20 miles to OLY when I acidently hit a button that changed the 
channel and I couldn't find it again and listened to something else.  Took 
about an hour and a half to drive the 80 miles home, not too bad considering 
the first 5 miles by the beach the roads were so bad they really really 
really sucked and there was a sign "rough roadway ahead" and they got better 
go figure and I was driving second gear and the road was bad shaking the bus. 
Rained a little bit, but only near Aberdeen really, it rains more there than 
here.</pre>
