   <h1>Bus karma (Friday....long)</h1>
   <b>Steve Carrington &lt;s.p_dot_carrington_at_bristol.ac_dot_uk&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1999-10-15 16:53:03+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Had to share this with the List.......must be bus karma at work here!

Last weekend, the Split Screen Van Club here in the UK organised the 
second annual London to Brighton run. Open to all air-cooled VWs, there is 
a Saturday morning cruise (750+ vehicles left the start at Crystal Palace 
to fight their way through the London traffic), and then all the vehicles 
are parked up in Type order on the seafront at Brighton - a fabulous 
sight. Over 1000 VWs were lined up together, including about 140 split 
screen buses. There is trade and entertainment organised throughout the 
day. All VWs on the seafront are entrants in a huge show and shine 
display. A very different event to the usual shows. The SSVC also arrange 
camping and entertainment in the evening at Brighton Racecourse (bands, 
DJs and a large bar!)

Back to the plot......it's Saturday evening after the seafront has been 
cleared (about 9pm), and I'm on the gate at Brighton Racecourse welcoming 
the campers. It's bl**dy cold, but myself and a few other SSVC stalwarts 
are coming to the end of our shift and looking forward to a relaxing, 
end-of-day drink in the bar......when a taxi rolls up to the gate. 
Passenger side window comes down and a distinctly American accent says 
"Hey....is there a bus event in town?" I peer closer into the 
darkness.......and it's Bill Bowman!!!! (NEATO president and fellow 
VintageBus listee) I almost fell over with shock - I couldn't get my head 
round this!! "Just thought I'd fly in to check out your event" he said! 

I'd met Bill earlier in the year when he toured round the UK and Europe 
(in his '55 sunroof deluxe Beetle), finishing up at Bad Camberg, as part of
the Return to the Fatherland Tour. The SSVC helped the Tour out with some 
arrangements and hosted them for an evening whilst they were in the UK. A 
few SSVC members (myself included) and their buses then had the privilege 
of joining the RTTF Tour on their trek through Holland, Belgium and 
Germany (a truly fantastic experience). 

Anyway, it turns out that Bill had earned a stopover due to the long haul 
flight he was working (Bill is a flight attendant with TWA). His first 
choice stopover was London - he said he never usually gets these flights
.......but this time he did. TWA put their London stopovers up in a hotel, 
but not in London.......in Brighton! Bill arrived early afternoon but was 
tired and grabbed a few hours sleep in his room. He got up early evening 
and went for a walk.......saw a few buses about the place and decided that 
there must be something going on....... He waved down a few bay window 
buses, but from the looks he got, he reckoned that the drivers thought 
they were going to be 'car-jacked'! He finally got a bus to stop - and 
found out about what had happened that afternoon on the seafront! He asked 
if anyone would still be about, and was told that alot of people were 
camping at the Racecourse. He asked if any of the Split Screen Van Club 
would be about and on learning that they'd organised the event, he figured 
that he would probably bump into someone he knew up there. 

Bill jumped into a taxi a little later after grabbing some food......and 
arrived at the gate while myself and a couple of other SSVC members he 
knew from the RTTF Tour were on duty....... If we couldn't believe it, 
then Bill himself was a little amazed! He was then totally astounded as we 
took him round the site and into the bar - a huge number of the people he 
met here on the RTTF Tour were about. It wasn't only UK people though - 
also there for the event were Jochen Brauer and his family (Jochen is the 
president of Bulli Kartei - the German club for pre-'67 Type 2s) and Hans 
Sprenkels and Pim van Loon of the National VW Club of Holland, who had 
also helped out big time while the RTTF Tour was in Europe. Now Bill 
really couldn't believe this was happening!! What was it someone 
said......."Now I know there's a God, and he drives a split-screen van!" 
We retired to the bar all night, and just talked about the summer trip and 
the London-Brighton event over several beers. Unreal.</pre>
