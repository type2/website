   <br/>
   <pre>cecil, go ahead and provide their names and phones, their are 6 major
wholesalers and importers of
vw and/or german parts in ths country, i purchase from all of them  and
between all of them the german bearings
could not be had , i have some connections in overseas  but i doubt that
they could come up
with all german bearings for this application,  as i have posted before FAG
the most popular imported german per se bearing
does not make these numbers due to lack of demand (as in the auto industry a
d or e mover) so that forces
them to purchase these bearings from an outside source as long as they meet
their specs. SKF were
never made in germany to my knowlage but originally where u.s.  made then
moved to mexico and canada
i'm sure that the new beetles, the type 1 beetles and the buses still
manufactured in mexico and brazil don't use german bearings and these
cars last forever even on their pot holed roads (don't count the new beetle
you can't buy them in mexico)
in my days of restoring 356 PORSCHE only on the concours perfectionest did i
use all german bearings and
seals, just in case they pulled a drum to check the seal in case of a points
tie, but used other import bearings
on the daily drivers.
in my 62 panel small nut tranny i have a combination of bearings, basically
whatever i could find at the time of
rebuild of the reduction boxes, this bus carries a load of over 1000 lbs at
all times and even more when fully loaded for a swap meet, i have put over
10,000 miles on these bearings without a bit of trouble, i have been selling
and using  imported bearings  since 1983 and can not ever recall a failure
in any car porsche or vw
i can understand your desire for all german bearings with the effort and
$$$$ you have put in your bus, i could
search and locate all fag german from some nos people but you would pay
dearly and i personally don't think
the cost would be justified, this is just my opinion
ronnie   old volks home of az

lots of splits and  other vw related stuff

if you wish you can check out my new web page and let me know what you  like
and don't
this is it's temp address   www.type2parts_dot_com/2/index.html  (still under
constructon)
see jerry jess hippy bus just keep reloadeing the type2 page
