   <h1>The Southern Saga - Part 7: Everybus to Candler</h1>
   <b>&quot;Brian M. Wittling&quot; &lt;kdfmotors_at_primary_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1999-05-06 07:41:50+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Sunday morning, after the sun begins it's climb into the sky of a new day, I
am finally able to get a little sleep.  The previous nights temperatures had
only allowed me to lay in my bus shivering all night long.  Man, if this
wasn't justification for the need of a 'co-pilot' I don't know what is!
<grin>  It wasn't long before I heard some knocking on the window of my bus.
I awoke, briefly, only to drop in and out of sleep  for the next hour or so.
When I finally was able to drag myself out of bed, it was about 9:30 or so.
I got about 3 hours of sleep... it was going to be a long day...

It was still a bit chilly outside, even thought the sun was shinning
brightly... the wind was really picking up too from the previous days..   I
hoped it wouldn't turn out to be a headwind.   I made a quick breakfast out
of some orange juice, kiwi fruits and a bagel, and set off to see who was
still around for the day.  Most everybody had left for the show in
Farmington, but a few still remained.  Jamie, John, and most of the
stink-foot encampment were around, and a few other people I had met the
night before, but couldn't remember their names.  Turns out I missed some
excitement when the Hot Deluxe-Bus Vixens left...  seems they impressed all
their male admirers when they pulled out, by laying a nice big scratch in
the gravel.

As it would turn out, John Yust and I would be heading the same way for the
better part of the day, and even though I would be driving considerably
slower than he, John decided to caravan along with me as far as Candler.
With that deal worked out, I set about breaking camp.  The tent came down
easily, however I had some trouble figuring out how to fold it up properly
to fit it back in to its storage bag.  I tossed my trash, stowed everything
away in the bus, and by about 11:30, John and I pulled out of Hagen-Stone
park.  Our progress was momentarily impeded when we had to stop to let a
family of ducks waddle across the road though (nature!  Ooohhhhh...) and we
were on our way!

We would have to go north through Greensboroug first, then turn west onto
40.  The ride north was fairly uneventful, even if the wind was quite
brutal.  The worst part was that it was then that I realized I would be
fighting a pretty strong  headwind for the drive.  When we finally did make
the turn West, I was really hurting!  It took all the old bus had just to
keep it up around 55.  Plus the fact that we were climbing up the Eastern
Continental Divide didn't help much either.  We pushed on though, and I must
commend John on his patience in staying behind me, because I know at any
time he could have just put the hammer down on that balanced, blueprinted,
dual-carbed 1600 of his and left me in a blaze of asphalt and H-4 smoke.  Oh
well, at least he would be getting really good mileage for this trip. <grin>

About an hour into the drive, it began to cloud up a bit, and it got a a bit
colder that it was even before...  I had all the windows closed, a sweater
on, and my baja, and I was still feeling a bit chilly!  (WHY didn't I hook
up the heat before this trip!  ARRGH!!).  We pulled off at a rest stop to
cool off my motor, for a bit, and it was there in the middle of North
Carolina, John ran into a couple from his own town in Tennessee!  They had
wandered over to admire the busses, and got into a conversation with John
over his "FURTHER" license plates. (relates back to a story from the "Whole
Earth Catalog" in which a writer drives cross-country in a red and white 21
window deluxe to receive his Pulitzer Prize I believe.  I'm  not sure of the
details.. I'm too young to remember such things <grin>).  So anyway, that
was pretty freaky, and after pondering the karma of the incident, John and I
were back on the road.

I was getting pretty worried about my bus after a while...  The heads were
running about 550 on the hills, and only cooling off to about 500, my oil
was running about 270, and the pressure was down about 10 pounds from where
it normally runs...  probably from the heat.  And to make matters worse,
even though you're climbing some pretty viscous hills on this stretch of 40,
there are very few "truck lanes" to pull into to let traffic by.  And to
make matters even worse than that, there is a lot of construction going on
so there is no shoulder in a lot of areas.  When driving my bus through
mountains, I pretty much take on Italian driving habits (whatever is behind
you does not matter) so I can't say for certain what it was like behind me,
but I bet I had traffic jammed up pretty good for a while.  Hey, when I'm
driving my bus, I'd just assume not worry myself with other people.. I'm
driving my bus dammit!  I don't need the added stress..  It's kinda like the
'Joo-Janta 2000 Peril Sensitive Sunglasses' from "the Hitchhikers Guide to
the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams...  Sunglasses which instantly turn black at
the slightest hint of danger, thus preventing you from seeing anything which
might alarm you.  Valium for the mind.. I don't care to know how badly I'm
screwing up everyone else's day by driving my bus slowly on the highway..</pre>
