   <h1>Just flew in from Bad Camberg, boy are my arms tired</h1>

   <pre>Ta-da-ting!	
Please forgive me if I ramble, I haven't slept much since last Wed.

Flew in to Dusseldorf on Thursday.  Waited patiently for my luggage that 
didn't make the flight.  Oh Well (I work for the airline, so my bags are the 
low priority to the baggage handlers) Went to Avis and rented a car.  I was 
hoping to get a Polo, since I was going to a VW show, but had to settle for a 
3 cyl Opel Corsia.  Incredibly high geared it cruised the Autobahn about 
90mph.  Saw a Vanagon Highroof.  My hotel was in Frankfurt, it took about 
2hrs to drive the distance which included a stop to use the toilet and get 
some junk food.
After 40 winks I headed to Bad Camberg on Friday.  At the Elf station I saw 
Jon Peters from the VVWCA.  He had his Westy Syncro shipped over.  Upon 
arrival in Europe, someone helped themselves to the instrument panel and turn 
indicators.  I guess someone wanted the US spec stuff.  Anyway Jon and I 
waved at each other just as we would if we saw each other in San Jose!  
Friday was a kick back and socializing day.  It was very strange to walk 
around and see a lot of familiar faces.
Walking around I ran into Richard Troy (of Karman Ghia fame, he shipped a 
Ghia over), Rich Spohn and Ray Schubert of the Golden Gate Chapter Of VVWCA.

Rick gave me directions to the Lotterman dealership and told me to be sure I 
went downstairs.  Trekking up to the dealership I saw the Fatherland Cruisers 
parked out front admist VW's 1999 lineup.  I paused for a moment of 
reflection and then went inside.  I went downstairs and saw a darkened room 
with middle-aged couple standing in front of it.  She was commenting on all 
the license plates from the US.  Apparently she saw one from their state.  I 
stopped next to the couple who seemed hesitant to go in, smiled at them and 
walked in.  I guess they figured if I was going in they might as well too.  
Carefully, in the dark, I could see a Schwimagen, a few bugs of various 
vintage, what looked to me as a K-70, a fridolin, a Kubel, and then in the 
corner...The world famous Lotterman Barndoor.  I fell to one knee in 
reverence.  Regaining my composure I stood up and fumbled for the light on my 
camcorder.  Just then, somebody turned on the room's lights.  Why didn't I 
think of that?

Saturday, was the big day.  The B-K was there with the mobile museum which 
included two ladder trucks, a highroof, the Florida Boy Single Cab, the 
tank-tread bus, and a few Westies.  The let people climb up the ladder trucks 
for birds-eye view photographs.  The swap was great.  However being a "late 
model" owner there wasn't much for me to buy.  I did see some incredible 
stuff.  People were all over, from all over, sharing stories, taking 
pictures, you know, VW camaraderie.

List people that I met were: Ronnie, Clara, Sam, Bill Bowman, Roger Nang, and 
at a flea market on Sunday; Uncle Jerry.

Sunday's highlight was a countryside cruise.  I ended up helping out as a 
"turn marshal" I went with Jon Peters and friend in the Syncro to an 
intersection in the sticks somewhere.  Our job was to make sure everyone made 
the right turn.  We parked on the side of the road and got ready.  Word came 
over the walkie talkie that the caravan was approaching.  Suddenly the 
Polizei showed up.  As we were explaining what we were doing out in the 
middle of nowhere with camcorders at the ready, the caravan came roaring down 
the hill.  Instead of being in position we were standing next to the Polizei 
car.  Uh-oh!  I ran across the road as the first car, a 4-door bug taxi, had 
stopped at the crossroads.  "Turn right, dude!"  "Danke"  The rest of the 
caravan followed.  It was quite a sight watching all the semaphores pop up as 
the turn was approached.  For those who were there I was wearing an Outback 
hat, a Split Bus Club T-shirt (my luggage arrived Sat), pointing to the right 
with one hand and trying to camcord with the other.
Things wound down after that.  I got some pizza and talked to a guy and his 
son from Georgia.  I then made my way back to Frankfurt, and did some 
sightseeing.  Most of the shops were closed, like the Blue Laws my Dad talked 
about. (when I was your age, stores were closed on Sundays...).
The old bugs and busses at this show was incredible.  Kimball said it was the 
largest gathering of Hebs, and there were a lot of Barndoors.  I'm still 
amazed.  My brain is overloaded.
As more people return I hope we get their stories and finds as well.
