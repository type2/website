   <h1>NQ's BNNTA Write-Up (1 of 2)</h1>
   <b>&quot;No Quarter&quot; &lt;silent_at_beatricene_dot_com&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2000-09-05 16:47:23+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>It had crossed my mind on more than one occasion that I could very well be
sitting here telling my tale of woe, of the BNNTA event that I had missed
for yet another year, of how my engine failed me in my time of need, etc.
Fortunately that was not the case.  I actually made it to BNNTA in a bus I
fixed up (with the help of many friends) on the longest trip I have taken
yet in a split window bus.  I have an accumulated 3,000 miles now in my
splitty of which the last approximately 700 miles have been on my dual
Weber'd 1776.  So for all of you who have followed my saga from the
beginning or are just looking for a good t2 story to read, here we go:

I posted my last message to the list sometime around Thursday evening.  I
had drilled out the jets on the 40IDF's and installed/gapped the chromoly
pushrods.  I wasn't done packing until about 1:00 a.m. and adrenalin kept me
up at least another hour.  I was up, packed, ready to go, and on the road at
6:50 Friday morning.  I decided to head south on 77 to Highway 36 east which
would take us the majority of the traveled miles to the BNNTA campsite.
Terry Wolfe had left Omaha on his maiden voyage of any great length in his
cream over red 65 Westy and was headed south on I-29 in Iowa which parallels
the Nebrasky/Iowa border.  A quick cell call earlier confirmed that we more
than likely would arrive at the pre-determined gas station within no more
than 30 minutes of each other.

Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Rob Laffoon had been taken by Terry the night
before to the Greyhound Bus depot.  Rob had left Omaha Thursday evening
enroute to Tulsa, OK to hopefully pick up a single cab that he had been
working on buying a couple weeks prior to the BNNTA event.  It had worked
out wonderfully that about the time the deal was sealed, the BNNTA event was
literally around the corner so Rob concocted the idea of picking up his 1966
SC and driving from Tulsa to BNNTA (424 miles!) Rob had tried to minimize
his carry-on weight on the greyhoud but still had a bag that was heavy and
laden with tools.  I think he mentioned that at each stop, he would quickly
dismount the greyhound and scurry to grab his bag before the attendants did
so they wouldn't know how much weight he had in his bag.  It was heavy but
necessary.  As planned, the owner of the SC picked up Rob about 5:30 Friday
morning and within 20 minutes of arriving at the guy's house, Rob was on his
way to BNNTA!

I beat Terry to the Conoco about 4 miles east of St. Joseph, MO and couple
of quick phone calls to Terry's cell resulted in me hearing nothing while
Terry heard himself talking.  I finally left voice mail and within 7 minutes
of my arrival at the station (9:55), I saw the little cream and red Westy
inching along the long flat stretch of highway!  Terry and I would have
arrived at the same time but due to the Conoco being a little farther down
than Terry had thought, he turned off to make sure I wasn't waiting at some
other exit.  After he got my v-mail, he boogied on down and there we were -
2 Nebraskies on their longest T2 trip yet!!!
As a little side note, on Highway 36 in KS, I spied a real nice maroon late
60's or early 70's Beetle for sale in a farmer's yard and then later saw a
beat up Maroon one for sale as well.  Close to St. Joseph I saw (not for
sale) and Baja'd Fastback - rather interesting!  Moving right along...

By this time I had noticed I was losing a lot of oil.  The 350+ trip took 4
quarts of oil and the engine was staturated top and bottom but mostly around
the rear.  I just kept pouring it in and figured I was going to make it come
hell or high water.  I followed Terry at his leisurely pace of 50 to 55,
keeping an eye on my lower revving engine's oil temps and making sure to
literally baby my engine during these first few hundred miles of break-in.
We stopped in some town along the way to grab food and camping supplies
because I told Terry that once we arrived at camp, we wouldn't want to
leave.  In agreement we ate at a McDonalds, loaded up on goodies for the
campout, and left, arriving at Monroe City, MO sometime about 3:00.

To say it was HOT out was an understatement.  The 102F heat pulled moisture
from your lips as you drove and your sweat glued you to your seat.  The good
part is that through all this heat, Terry's bus still just purred along and
my oil temps never exceeded 195F.  I was pulling a roof rack with a bike
laying in the top, tools, personals, and a complete 1600DP turnkey for the 3
of us just in case.  Not until we reached the campsite did my oil temps hit
200 as heat soak and idling around caught up with me.  We finally parked
near the entrance so Rob could find us.  I registered, met up with Bill
Bowman (great guy!), and within 45 minutes a little green SC rolled up.  IT
WAS ROB!  Yeah - he made it!!!  I was so happy for him.  The little SC got
him there but she was running too damn hot - so much so I was surprised it
made it there.   You could tell Rob was tired and rightly so.  He'd had more
of an adventure than any of us did and a lot more unknowns.  I set out to
find why I was loosing so much oil and I found that I had failed to put the
o-ring on the 009!  Terry suggested a hack with duct tape but I was
confident that by asking around, someone would have what I needed.  As it
turns out, 3 campsites down from us, a fella (sorry I can't remember your
name!) had a brand new dizzy o-ring - still in RMMW wrap!  He didn't want
anything for it - he just told me to help someone else out sometime.  I
slapped that o-ring in and I lost a LOT less oil on the return trip.  I also
failed to mention that while I was cruising the campsite the first time, I
spied Isaiah and we both knew each other right away from seeing each other
on out websites.  Later Friday evening, I saw a blond headed guy visiting
with Isaiah and while we were introducing outselves to each other, he said,
"My name is Shawn..." and about the same time, we kind of knew who each
other was.  It was neat later on that Shawn let me drive his 1960 deluxe
into town (11 miles) while I was looking out of my old windshields that now
live in his bus - old tint still intact! :-)</pre>
