   <pre>Christian,

Thanks for the wonderful writing. Quite an adventure you took. Since I
live in California, I don't have a clear view of the political climate
in S. A. Things must be quite stable for a group to take such a long
trip on the open road. Can you enlighten us as to the political
situations down there?

Best of luck on the rally next year.

Chris
