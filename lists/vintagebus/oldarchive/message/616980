   <h1>A Burl Ives Christmas, Rudolph circa 1978...</h1>
   <b>Jim Ellis &lt;ellisjames_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2002-12-14 04:09:34+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>It is the Hanukkah/Christmas/Kwanza holiday Season which brings back many
memories. At least the ones that I can recall... The L. Ron Hubbard crowd
claims that environmental triggers are secondary engrams, residual mental
impressions, of events long since past in our personal histories. 

My wife and I are pleased and feel all warm and and clammy inside knowing that
we have two wonderful and healthy children. Little minds fresh from bad
influences awaiting the joys of life. The family unit is huddled around the
television watching the Burl Ives Christmas special, "Rudolph the Red-nosed
Reindeer". Every time I see this program I recall the time that I freaked
following an accidental dosing of Angel Dust in 1978. 
A neighbor of mine at the apartment complex, "Mota" Benny, was on the phone
when I came over to visit. He was on the telephone to someone so I politely
waited for him to complete the call anticipating that we would make plans for
the evening. Perhaps he had a line on a good time so I waited. and waited...
and waited... Benny eventually lit a skanky looking joint that looked like it
had been dipped in VW transmission fluid, rat droppings, and for some reason
wrapped in foil. Not to doubt him, being a little scary himself, Mota Benny
took a hit and handed it to me. Told me to take a hit. As a lame excuse, I'll
esplain that dope "back in the day" barely took the edge off and simply relaxed
us. It did not turn us all into drooling mental Gumbys as I've heard from the
nightly news. In today's tightly controlled Baptist attending and defense
contractor employed random testing kind of world I'm glad that I am long since
distanced from that scene. Oh, yeah, back to Benny... (almost forgot) I
dutifully took a hit and started to hand it back. He held up the hand as if
"talk to the..." and said to take another. He continued to talk smack to Lupita
Pechogrande. Whelp, not to be a party pooper and only uoccasionalvery
occassional imbibement of the lightest and poorest quality of the Mexican
mayhem I did my duty and handed it back. I was verging on Sainthood and didn't
want to mess up my chanReverendecoming the Reverand Jim. Once again, Benny
pretended to be too involved in the booty call and told me to take another.
With permission given to be the Bogart of the ball I started to draw like a pro
when he suddenly said "MAYBE YOU BETTER NOT~ well... OK, go ahead". Hmmm, no
one ever acted that way over a simple joint but hey, who am I to complain? At
least he had "Boogie-Oogie,Oogie" (Grammy- Song of the year for 1979) on the
8-track and was playing it over the stereo with the blinking Disco light
speakers.  Cool, at least the TV was on. He remained on the phone lining up his
prospects de pecador. 
The room began to get hot as hell and I became impatieagitated unusually
aggitated adidn'trvous. My beer didnt last but two swallows and it was Michelob
spewage to boot. The bean bag chair was impossibly uncomfortable. Felt like Tim
Conway on the fairway.  The twinkling emitting from the strmini lights seasonal
minilights wrapped around balcony guardrail called my name. I was drawn
throuAcadiamal-adjusted arcadia glass doors and sliding screen out to the
cooling air of the dead of late December... I stayed out on suddenlyony until I
suddnely realized that I was about frozen. The multicolored horizontally
striped Disco sweater, bikini briefs and Angelflights were no match for the
elements. It's a dry cold in Arizona. ;-)
My mind and body went inside and watched the Christmas specials. Mota Benny was
still negotiating like OJ Simpsonsargumentsm team in closing arguements. The
stop animated wooden puppets looked 3D as they floated through the Norelco
electric Winter wonderland and the Alvin-Chipmunks, Bing Crosby child beating,
Burl Ives razor commercial madness. The action was only highlighted only by the
Chia-pet Ronco extravaganzas and used car adverts from twitching eyed Pete
Ellis and the used car cowboy in the eastern suburbs.
The words floated out of the stiff jawed wooden characters like colorful soap
bubbles out of a blow pipe during kiddie bath hour~! =) The characters looked
to gravitate back and forth from a composition of highly polished plastic and
date expiring Tofu. Benny refused to end the conversation and the tape of the
Silver Convention had repeated iBee Gees self at least once. The Beegees were
not tolerable so I bailed on Benny and Lupita la Impalpable. I was tripping, so
I navigated upstairs to my studio to watch the specials on my 13" black and
white. 

Once I come home from a day of building war machines, I limit myself to Fat
Tire Amber ale and figgy pudding with my Burl Ives. I sit back and concentrate
on preaching Jesus, raising kids who will avoid Benny and criticize the moronic
war mongering masses.  Hypocritical to the Nth degree I know but employment,
for the moment, out weighs starving darkness and homeless kids. If anyone
wantsBeer drinkingriter in support of Beerdrinking Baptists for Jesus, please
let me know. 

This has most definitely been a strange week. I say put Moby in charge of the
911 investigation, force Trent Lott to tour with Bush as opening act for Axl
Rose and the boinoculationay to get the first innoculation of Small Pox in his
RCA jack. 


Take care and have a happy Holiday Season!
