   <h1>Trip Report- Long Version 1</h1>
   <b>Diana &lt;dianak_at_intouch.bc_dot_ca&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1999-05-28 06:35:23+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>So this is my trip report.  It might be embellished a little.
Wouldn't want to be boring.
WARNING: NONE OF THE FOLLOWING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED MECHANICAL
ADVICE.  IN FACT, DO NOT TRY ANY OF THE REPAIRS MENTIONED IN THIS
REPORT AT HOME.

Part 1: Tennessee
After 23 days of travel in the large red propane-powered school
bus, I arrived in Tennessee.  More specifically, at Jason Black's
place in Nashville.  He graciously welcomed the whole troop of us
into his apartment that evening, whereupon we kept him up well
past his appointed bedtime, causing him to be late for school and
to receive a beating from the school principal.
The next evening (Friday) we again met up with Jason, this time
in Knoxville at the home of the much-anticipated '66 Westfalia
which I was fated to acquire.  It was late, so we didn't do too
much to the bus, although Jason did fix the gas pedal.
Saturday morning.  Once all my friends had left (after scattering
all of my things haphazardly about on the lawn, so that poor
Jason's parents must have thought we were having some kind of
weird yard sale) I began the task of putting my motor back
together.  Jason wisely stayed on the other side of the garage
while I tried to remember which piece had come off last (and
therefore, should go on first).  Eventually I managed to get it
all together, with only a couple of mistakes.
My idiot book was not usable because it had gotten soaked with
water when we got caught in a thunderstorm in Mississippi.  In
fact, most of my parts were carried in two large plastic bins on
the giant (8'x12') roof rack on the school bus.  I had assumed
that the bins were fairly watertight and that they had drainage
holes in them.  WRONG.  So certain items suffered some damage.  I
also discovered that the spring for my thermostat flaps had been
hooked up wrong, in addition to the thermostat being
disconnected, so that the flaps were always closed.  A bad deal,
but all fixed now.
So, I finally had the motor together.  I stayed up late blabbing
to Jason about all manner of bus stuff, then the next morning we
put the motor into the bus.  Actually Jason did.  I pretty much
watched, and put in the top bolts.  The fuel pump leaked, so we
changed it.  Also the fan (bent) was rubbing against the fan
shroud and making a racket.  S&*T!!  I was considering wedging
something behind the fan shroud, because when it was pulled on
the noise would stop.  Then Jason informed me that the correct
factory procedure for such a problem was simply to remove the
upper left hand screw on the fan, which immediately made the
noise stop.  Also, we reasoned, it is wise to remove all
unneccessary parts in order to improve gas mileage.  ;-)
After the bumpers and splash pan had been installed and the
shifter fixed, the bus was perfect.  The shifter Jason had was
pretty ugly (sorry Jason) and I wanted my stock shifter on
there.  Unfortunately this required some modification, because
the new one didn't sit far enough down into the shift rod
(coupling??)  With some cutting and welding, I was happy and the
bus shifted too.
All that remained was paperwork.  Prior to my leaving, Jason and
I had agreed on a very fair price for this bus.  It's not
perfect, but it's nicer than my last bus.  No gaping rust holes
or anything, although there are a few dents and repairs.  And the
interior is pretty much all there (no icebox thing) and in good
shape.  It could use a paint job.  And my motor.  However, to my
amazement, Jason had decided to give the bus to me as a gift, in
the Charlie Ford tradition.  Free bus to good home.
Monday, I went and transferred the bus into my name, leaving with
some new Tennessee license plates.  The perfect disguise, now
everybody thinks I'm an American.  Apparently I would also need a
Tennessee driver's license in order to get insurance on this
bus.  Since the license testing place was closed Mondays, I drove
back to Nashville.  The ride was sweeett!!  I felt like I was
driving a brand new 1966 Westy.  My motor was running smoother
than ever, and it sure was nice with that stock tranny.
About 25 miles out of Knoxville, I decided to get off the
interstate, even though I wasn't doing too badly in terms of
getting blown away by traffic.  The speedo doesn't work, so I
can't say how fast I was going.
As soon as I pulled off the freeway, the bus died.  Wouldn't
run.  Limped to the side of the road, just off the off-ramp.  My
first suspicion was the "new" fuel pump I had just put on.  I
pulled off the fuel line to the carb and it was empty.  I then
positioned the line so that any gas coming out of it would be
visible on the engine tin and turned the key for a few seconds.
Returning, there was no gas anywhere, so I concluded that the
fuel pump was the problem.  I went across the street and asked
where the closest FLAPS was.  Lucky for me, NAPAwas only a couple
of blocks away.  They said it would take a day to get a VW fuel
pump, but they sold me a crazy electric one instead.  At first
the guy at the counter was dubious when I told him I could
install it, but he recovered after I told him that I had put the
motor together and installed it and was driving home to
Vancouver.  I installed the fuel pump but still no go.  I decided
to do the damsel in distress routine and call AAA.
The AAA truck towed my bus over to the NAPA where I got the fuel
pump, and the mechanic found the coil wasn't working either.  No
big surprise, since it had been immersed in water.  He replaced
it with a coil off I don't know what, about an inch longer than
the VW coil but hey, what can you do?  It worked.  He also
'fixed' the ground wire from the fuel pump, which I had attached
to the right side coil screw.  More on that later.
At 5:30 pm, I left the NAPA and drove like the wind, to Nashville
to meet Jason for dinner.  We had Chinese food that came with
shiny bits of a pot scrubber in it.  The staff were very strange,
but they gave us free cookies and apologized about the bits of
metal in our food, which we had not mentioned to them.
Having overstayed my welcome and deprived Jason of many hours of
sleep, I made my departure the following morning, a Tuesday.  My
first task was to acquire a Tennessee driver's license.  For this
purpose, I rented a small car and drove it to the DMV.  The lady
at the DMV informed me that I would need a social security # to
get a driver's license.  As I am Canadian, I am not eligible for
a SSN.  I tried to explain this to her, but she insisted that I
go down to the Social Security office and get a number.  So I
did.  I asked the man with a gun who acted as a sort of reception
desk/security guard which box I should check off for
citizenship.  He was of the opinion that, as I was born in
Canada, I must be a US citizen.  Duh.  You know, Canada, that
OTHER COUNTRY up North?  Anyway, I didn't think I could get away
with claiming to be a US citizen, so I tried to explain to the
lady at the counter that I was not legally eligible to work in
the USA, nor did I want to, I just needed a license.  That didn't
fly, so I went back to the DMV.  This time, I got a different
lady.  I gave her my Social Insurance card and told her it was a
Canadian social security number.  She went for it. ("I've never
seen one like this before")   After an incredibly easy test and
$19.50, I had a Tennessee driver's license.  But they made me
surrender my Canadian one.  Lame.
At this point I wanted nothing more than to get out of
Tennessee.  So I did.  I crossed into Missouri, then out of it
and into Arkansas, where I spent an uneventful night in the
Wal-Mart parking lot.

More to come...
