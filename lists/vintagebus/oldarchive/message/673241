   <h1>[VB] 1600 saga (long)</h1>
   <b>soundex_at_eden_dot_com (craig k)</b><br/>
   <i>1999-11-26 06:46:15+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>OK, so here's the tale of the case:
  The 1600 I rebuilt came with my bus 10 years ago; PO had receipts for
rebuilt heads and Monza exhaust. Bus barely made it the 150 miles to Austin
when I moved -  found out that the rebuilder had failed to shim the 3/4
head, resulting in those pistons striking it, and pushing the heads off the
top of the jugs. Shimmimg was required because someone had clearanced the
case for hotrodding and also cut the cylinder seats for a longer stroke
crank! Have no idea how many miles it had on it that way. Took it to
Motormania here in Austin and had it 'repaired' - I don't consider the job
he did a 'rebuild'  due to the number of used parts put in,  but I can't
complain as it ran w/out problem for 20,000 miles.

   Decided the case was having problems because the ratio of RPMs to speed
had begun to climb, as well as temp. My local guru thought it was just
wonky gauge electrics (he don't like gauges), but #3 was down to 85 psi,
and I found metal bits in the oil, so out it came. Teardown revealed that a
lifter  was coming apart (and spreading metal chunks throughout the case).
Motormania had used reground lifters to save me some bucks; something I
obviously now think was foolish of me.  Distro gear lash was looking weird,
too, which accounted for the odd whirring noise the engine made. Thought,
'let's do it right!'
Well, within reason - no budget for new case, Berg crank, etc!!

   The case is a doghouse Mexican B w/ dual reliefs, AS 41 - no serial #,
so I don't know anything else. Rebuilt once or twice?  Odometer reads
82,000 and I assume there is a one in front of that,  so who knows?
Motormania cut it to 40 over, and the saddles were still in great shape, so
we elected to simply clean it up. Found a good standard crank in the pile;
looks low miles, shiny,  and was still well within spec (forget the exact
measurement).
Pulled a clean pair of 311 101 373A singleport heads out and had my friend
Lewis replace seats, valves, 3 angle cut 'em, etc.

   Meanwhile, I ordered some items from Gene Berg... 311 401B rods,
balanced and machined center-to-center; 'pick-of-the-litter' 85.5 pistons
and cylinders, honed and balanced  to within .5 grams of each other;
doublethrust cam bearings; and lifters modified with an oiling groove.
Added cost for the niceties was a little over $100, and I consider it
insurance.  Almost got the GB full-ride SP heads w/ heavy springs, fullflow
job and swivelfeet, as Clyde was very persuasive (friendly and helpful, too
- even before they had my card #!), but decided to try those later, AFTER I
save for them :P.

  Case assembly was nerve-wracking, but fairly easy. Put in a T3 distro and
set the play while the case was still split. New cam and new Schadek oil
pump. Used the Permatex aircraft sealant (brown gunk) on the case halves.
Cleaned ALL the threads spotless before torquing (used primeNkleen, too).
Make SURE you have everything ready to go when you start to put it
together!  Read EVERY book I had, all the archive posts I could find and
Hoover - must have done it right, as the crank turned w/ no binding. Whew!
Buttoned it all up and started on the heads.
   All the head chambers were cut to 54-56CC, as close as I could get them
and on spec. Put .060 worth of spacers under each jug to give me a deck
height of .09," a deck volume of 13.13cc and a compression ratio around
6.8:1. If I measured it all correctly :). Painted the jugs w/ diluted black
enamel and then wire brushed any thick spots off. Wanted to use T3 tin, but
Lewis (who was helping me that day) was already torquing one head by the
time I found some bailing wire to tie them on! He set the valves and took
off, and I went to work on the fan housing.  I had a fuel-injected b*g
housing, which has the MOST  cooling flow, but needed to clean it - dunked
it in a homemade electrolysis tank made out of a garbage can. REALLY worked
well. Painted it and drilled it for the throttle tube, as it's location is
different on an FI housing. Spent a day cleaning the crap outta the heat
risers on the manifold... a tip: DON'T screw w/ carb cleaners, torches,
clutch cables etcetc. Simply drill a hole where the riser first starts to
bend and run a clothes hanger thru it until you can blow thru it; then
braze some brass into the hole to close it. Time it took me to clean up a
6v-bus manifold the day before: 6 hours, only to discover the carb wouldn't
clear the 12v generator. Time to drill hole, clean and braze up a
late-model bug manifold: 1 hour. Can blow thru it like a shofar!! Painted
it silver and slapped it on. Finished putting on all the tin work (all
cleaned and painted, natch - even the Hoover bit) and applied silicone
sealer to every spot air could escape. Checked and set the thermostat and
flaps. Set the end play; three .010" shims gave me .004" which is dead on.

    Got out my boofull NOS heater boxes and muffler from Bus Depot, sloshed
some phosphoric acid thru em and coated them with 3 cans of Krylon BBQ
paint (Hunter Green, which is a nice complement to the Delta Green of the
bus); muffler paint prolly won't last, but the heater boxes should look
good for a while. Painted the generator pulley as well - looks like an ME
109 nose!
Filled it full of non-detergent 10-weight and rocked it from side-to-side
to lube the rockers; attached the starter/bellhousing doohickey and a fresh
battery. Cranked with the coil disconnected for 20 secs at a time until the
oil light went out, then a bit more. Attached the coil and let it rip...
caught after about 6 tries and came to life!! I ran it at 2500, up and down
a bit, for around 12 minutes - the scooter fuel tank I was using only held
mebbee 2 quarts of gas, so ran out before I was really ready to quit. No
bad noises (except a possible bum generator bearing) . Not even hot to the
touch. No oil leaks obvious, but I did later find one small drop on the
head fins between 3 and 4; I may have a leaky cooler or stand. Drained the
oil; some chunks of black gook (carbon or permatex?) and VERY tiny amounts
of metal shavings, but no chunks. Let it cool and checked the valves; they
had dropped to zero, which I gather is ok as it means they have seated in
the seats.....  Reset them at .006 and refilled w/ 30weight. This weekend I
plan to run it at 2500 for another few minutes, and then start breaking in
the rings: revving it to 2500 and letting go of the throttle arm and
dropping it to idle several times for about 20 minutes. After that, I am
contemplating swapping gen bearings and checking on the doghouse while I;m
at it.
If all goes well, it should be back in the bus before Xmas, and broken in
by New Years.</pre>
