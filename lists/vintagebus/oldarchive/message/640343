   <pre>The Big Kansas City MoKan Trip - Part 3
================================

 The next morning I didn't get up until 8:00 or so.  We were all just so
worn out from the late night and the drive from the night before so we
traded an early start for sleep and I for one didn't regret it.

 Before leaving, we raised up Rob's adjustable front end to help alleviate
some handling problems.  With radios in hand, we headed for KC using Dan
Kinsey's directions.  We had a nice time chatting with each other.  I led
because I was the slow one, then Dan in his red CRX, and Rob behind him.
Oil temps were kosher on the way down and with Justin riding shotgun once
again, we had no problem getting on our proper turnoff.  Shortly thereafter
was a neat old tunnel so I had to honk the horn.  The echo was kind of eerie
and awesome at the same time!  We also spied a 21 window in a fenced in auto
shop yard and when we started seeing some dubs, we knew we were close.
Using Dan Buser's fiance Wendy's directions to home us in, we found the
square!  The first guy I saw I didn't know.  He was a big guy in a straw hat
and he walked up to my open window and said, "Hello Erin!"  I later found
out this to be Rick Taylor.  It's weird when people come up to you and know
who you are based upon your web page and verbal description and you can't
place them.  I guess that is sort of what it's like to be a celebrity of
sorts.  As I crept along, I was asked if I was entering the show.  I
declined but later wished that I would have just to add a rough driver bus
to the lot.  If there was a worst of show award, I would have grabbed it for
sure!

 We headed for the parking lot and with tourist loot in tow, we set out for
the show.  Dan Kinsey, my host for the week, was easy to spot with his
shorts, dove blue Binz double cab, and lot of parts for sale.  I really
enjoy getting to know these bus guys because if you need a place to sit or
hang out in the shade, they'll let you sit in their rides.  How can you get
any better than sitting in a Binz slinging the breeze with an old VW buddy?
:-)

 There were not as many entries in the show as there had been in the past
but nevertheless, the quality was there.  The 49 Heb from Trenton was there
courtesy of its new owner.  The previous owner had let me touch it, sit in
it, fiddle with the knobs, etc. but this time, I got the feeling the Heb was
in the Do Not Touch class.  I spent a little bit telling people the story
behind the car.  It was in the same family since it's import back in the
late 40's early 50's and was only recently sold.  I guess good ol' Art would
have rather had the money and I can't blame him.

 I just saw lots and lots of assorted cool rides.  There was a guy named
Gary Meyer I believe who drives a 55 oval in somewhat rough shape but it's
his daily driver in the summer.  He's done a lot of work to the bug but it
still has no interior to speak of (doors are of a heavy guage steel - WOW!)
but the original engine is in it and he just drives and drives it.  He's a
humble guy and I really enjoyed chatting with him.  The other car was a MINT
62 beetle imported from Germany a few years ago.  I forget the owner's names
but this bug caught my eye and I just had a gut feeling that I needed to
visit with the owners.  The beetle was purchased new by a chemical company
in Germany and a year later, a family friend bought it.  Time went on and
the beetle was drivin occasionally but always kept garaged.  Years later,
the widow sold it to this couple.  Everything is original.  Matter of fact,
the guy told me that when it reached port in Houston, he rolled it out, did
some brake work, put in new oil, and with the 15 year old gas still in it,
fired it up and drove it to Dallas to have it shipped to the KCMO area.  The
car is a light greenish color and had a tiny Brandenburg Gate (sp?) emblem
on the speaker grill and a manual mileage counter with thick German writing
on it.  The car had spent the previous 15 years in a garage undriven there
in Germany and with barely anything over 30,000km and the tires still
holding air, was wheeled out and prepped for the trip over here.  Absolutely
awesome!!!</pre>
