   <h1>Jerome Trip Report pt 1 (long) </h1>

   <pre>Part 1

So after about a month of flip flopping on whether or not to go to Jerome, I
decided on Tuesday that if I could get paid early, I would head out early
Thursday morning. I was driving to work at 9am on Wednesday morning,
cruising down I-25 thinking happy thoughts about Jerome and the Friends I
missed and would be seeing again. Midway through a pleasant thought, the bus
coughed once and made a THUNK sound and lost a TON of power.( it was just
after a truck pulling a Jayco trailer passed me... see explanation later)
Just my luck, I thought to myself, My engine picks RIGHT NOW to grenade... I
thought, by the sound of it, that I had thrown a rod as the noise was rather
audible and the bus was getting slower and slower. I limped it to the park &
ride, where I pulled over to survey the damage. Keeping the engine running
(didn't know if it would ever start again) I carefully opened the decklid
fully expecting to see a steel connecting rod poking through the soft
magnesium alloy, repeatedly beating itself into a self induced coma. I
forced my eyes to look towards what I thought would be a molten ball of
metal or what USED to be an engine, and then I saw the most beautiful thing
imaginable... a Spark Plug had come out of the head. Granted, I live in a
strange, self imposed little world but it was beautiful to me! This same
plug had backed out about 2 weeks before and stripped the hole in the head,
was helicoiled back in, and thought to be fixed... but apparently not. I let
the engine cool down as much as possible before sticking my hand into the
burning hot spark plug hole to feel for damage. Not feeling anything, I
tried to thread the plug back in, and finally gave up after I realized that
the helicoil was missing the first two rows of threads. I limped the bus on
3 cylinders to the nearest VW shop, Vee-W Unlimited in Loveland which just
happened to be the place that helicoiled the plug the last time. I told Dick
(the owner) my problem and he said I probably had a cracked head, and needed
to replace it. I told him of my plans and aspirations of attending the
Jerome Jamboree the coming weekend and he just kinda looked at me and said
"you better get working on that..." Dick hooked me up with a good head, on
which he lapped the valves and checked the seats before sending me on my
merry way...THANKS DICK!  Now comes the first of many "don't try this at
home"'s in this story...

I drove the bus on 3 cylinders from Loveland to my Job in the south east
side of Boulder, a total distance of around 40 miles. It wasn't the fact
that I was driving on 3 that made it fun, it was the fact that I could do
about 55mph down hills and on the flat, and about 30 up hills... That isn't
quite contusive to having fully loaded gravel truck semi's following you
about 3 inches off the rear bumper. Its a miracle that I don't have "mack"
tattooed on the ass end of my bus... I limped the bus to work, blown plug
and all, and rolled into the shop about 3 hours late. Told Tyler and Joe the
story, and Tyler started falling off his chair, he was laughing so hard. He
had told me about 2 weeks pryor to beware of a Red Jeep Cherokee pulling the
previously mentioned Jayco trailer. I'm not one to necessarily believe in
premonitions, but Tyler is getting pretty dang accurate with his... I worked
all day, until about 3 hours after I was supposed to get off to make up for
the lost time, and then pulled my bus into the shop and started tearing into
it. At this point, it was about 9pm. I yanked the engine out in record time,
as I wanted my bus fixed and fixed RIGHT NOW!!! Joe had a good point when he
told me something along the lines of "do it right the first time" and
"you're going to be here all night regardless, might as well take your time
and clean stuff up while you're there" So that I did. I took all my tin and
solvent tanked, wire brushed, and painted it. (with hammertone black krinkle
finish...looks NICE for spray paint) I pulled off the old head, which had a
BIG crack between the spark plug boss and the exhaust valve seat. I replaced
the head, did a valve adjustment, put everything back together, torqued
things down to spec (see, I AM capable of changing my ways) made sure
everything was tight and where it was supposed to be, put the engine back in
the bus, hooked the wiring, fuel, and throttle cable back up, and took it
for a test drive. By this time it was 4am on Thursday morning. I drove the
bus down the road behind the shop, and noticed a huge increase in power,
being that it was firing correctly on all 4. I drove about 1 mile then
turned around, and in the process, the bus started stumbling and popping
through the exhaust. I limped it back into the shop only to find that
removing the # 1 & #2 plug wires didn't do anything to affect the idle of
the engine. I made sure the wires were on tightly. They were. I checked to
see if the plugs were installed correctly. They were. Checked the cap &
rotor to find a little corrosion, but nothing unusual. I killed the engine,
then popped the valve cover, only to find all four pushrods on the 1 / 2
side to be completely off their rocker arms. I had apparently forgotten to
tighten and torque the rocker shaft securing nuts, and they had backed off,
allowing the shaft to float freely around. I took the assembly apart, made
sure nothing was damaged, replaced a pushrod that wasn't quite straight,
bolted everything back together, re-adjusted the valves with the engine hot
(don't try this at home #2) re-checked all my torque values, slapped the
valve covers back on and took it for yet another test drive. By this time it
was 5:30am. I took the bus on an extended test drive to go get something for
breakfast, on which it ran smooth with no problems, but it wasn't quite as
fast as before. I chalked it up to the valves being WAY too loose, and
shrugged it off. I came back to the shop, where I ate breakfast in peace and
watched the sun rise through the crisp morning air. As I finished my
breakfast I took a moment to take in the beauty of the sun hitting the
flatirons and the surrounding mountains. With that happy thought in mind, I
folded down my bed, pulled the curtains, and passed out.

The morning came all too soon, as it was already present before my passing
out. I think I acquired around 3 hours of sleep, which was far too short for
a person who normally sleeps 10-12hrs _at_ a time... I worked all day, somehow
working a deal for my singlecab to change hands, allowing for my finances to
be in order and ready for the trip to Jerome. I left work around 6pm, went
home, took a shower, changed clothes, packed, did a "kick the tires"
inspection of my bus, loaded up, and headed out. I hit the road at 8pm, with
the odometer reading 63600 & 0/10ths. I fueled up, and headed south. After
pumping myself up on sugar and Mountain Dew "Amp" energy drinks, (yet
another "don't try this at home" )  I reached albuquerque at around 5am
Friday morning, which really wasn't too awful bad timewise. I went to super
wally world to stock up on some things I had forgotten in my haste to leave,
then attempted to find my friend Shawn and his lovely wife Cynthia's house
in the dark. If you've ever been to the west side of Albuquerque, you know
that every house is stucco / adobe and is painted light tan. They also all
have xerascaped front yards (rocks, cacti & yucca instead of grass & shrubs)
They were apparently also all built by the same contractor, as there were
about 5 different floorplans scattered throughout several thousand houses.
What I'm getting at is they more or less all looked the same... even more so
at 5am... I called Shawn, who was already up anyway, and he gave me
directions to his house. It turned out I was 2 blocks away when I called...
I pulled up, went inside, talked with Shawn awhile, grabbed some Buses &
Balloons flyers, drank another mountain dew energy drink, said goodbye, and
hit the road once again.

Between Albuquerque and Flagstaff I really don't remember too much, except
that all the rock around Gallup, Nm was volcanic. I enjoy noticing and
identifying things like that... I hit Flag around 1:30pm Friday afternoon,
and promptly found a car wash. I attempted to blast the oil spots off the
back of the bus that had been accumulating since I left. (small oil leak to
take care of) I really didn't want to smell oil when I slept, so I though
this a worthwhile use of my time. I found out in short order that the water
pressure in Flag (or at least at this car wash) was nothing to write home
about, but then again, I was in the desert... After my half-assed carwash, I
took some time to empty the trash I had accumulated in the front of the bus,
making it almost presentable once more. (keyword: Almost) I headed out of
Flag at around 2:00pm, south on Highway 89a. The stretch of the
aforementioned highway between Flagstaff and Cottonwood is some of the most
beautiful stretch of highway I have ever laid eyes on. As I drove through
Oak Creek Canyon, I once again heard a dreaded noise...one loud WHACK
followed by the generator light coming on. I pulled over and opened the
decklid, already knowing what to expect. The fanbelt had broken, and
disintegrated. Fortunately, I couldn't have picked a more beautiful spot to
be working on the bus. The scene was a pull-off high on a switchback, next
to a burbling creek, near the chirping birds and the gentle sound of the
breeze floating through the trees. I took my time, enjoying the
surroundings, to replace the belt. I got it all patched up, running smooth
again, took one last look around, and headed on towards Jerome. Passing
through Sedona, I admired the bright red rock formations, speculating on
their content and creation. I noted how I would love to live in Sedona
someday (after I sell a kidney on Ebay...) Dreaming about starting a
campground with buses as "Der kamper kabins", continued on past Sedona,
through Red Rock State Park. The geology through this area is nothing short
of profusely stunning. Words can't even begin to describe the scene, except
possibly "Wow!" Not really having any timetable, I stopped to take in the
Spires of iron saturated rock that jutted out of the desert floor like
natures own skyscrapers reaching out towards the painted sky. After
absorbing more beauty than is possible to retain in the memory, I headed
onward, towards my final destination. As I continued down oak creek canyon,
I passed "slide rock state park", a wonderful little piece of real estate
where oak creek has cut a natural waterslide into the slickrock / sandstone.
My thoughts wondered to visions of last year when a few of us stopped to
play in the water and had a good time co-mingling with nature. Happy
thoughts in mind, I cruised on down into Cottonwood, Az where I stocked up
on Ice and beverages for the forthcoming campout. A short trip through town
and a turn down the road to jerome... It was so close I could feel it! The
hill into Jerome is something to be experienced. Buses with no first gear or
who aren't firing on all four, all I can say is GOOD LUCK! The grade is
anywhere from 2% to 14% with some steep switchbacks and wicked washboards.
After beating my suspension into submission, I finally pulled into the "Gold
King Mine", the site of the campout. I drove around a bit, trying to find
friends to camp with, when I saw Lou & Liz from Havasu's '61 Subhatch westy
with color matched trailer. I knew that I would be in good company camping
with Lou & Liz, so I pulled in and parked. I got out, said my hello's and
introductions to our campmates and campsite neighbors, cleaned up a bit and
set up camp. WE MADE IT!!!
