   <h1>Tri-Chapter Camp Out, Eldon MO.</h1>
   <b>&quot;Brian M. Wittling&quot; &lt;kdfmotors_at_primary_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1999-05-21 07:42:42+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Only a few days after the end of the epic Southern Journey, I was preparing
the bus for yet another camping event.  This one was going to be down in the
boonies of Missouri, near the Lake of the Ozarks.  In attendance would be
members of the Missouri Micros, Kansas City Kombi's, and SAMBA, all Missouri
chapters of NEATO.  The campground was the "Lazy 'K'" near the Lake dam, and
the 'main drag' of the lake area.

Friday morning, I get to a late start, and set off making preparations for
the weekend...  clean out the bus - which was still a mess from the Southern
journey -  and get the gear together, pack clothes, etc.  I don't get out
the door until about 3, and I had wanted to be there by then!  My 1st stop
was the local grocery, and as I pulled into the parking lot, I spotted the
Yosemite Yellow roundy owned by fellow Micro Steve Lashley.   I park next it
(for the karma) and head inside.  There, I caught up with Steve in the
frozen foods isle, and we chatted about our plans for the weekend.  He was
getting groceries, and planned on returning to work for a short time, and
heading to the campground.  We would be taking the same route, so Steve
would prolly catch up to me later.

My 2nd stop was the gas station, and I also got some ice since I forgot to
do so at the grocery store. After that, it was the Highway!  Just as I was
turning onto 44, it started to rain pretty good, and continued to come down
for a good half hour or so. Traffic was pretty screwed up because of it, and
it took me a lot longer than it should have to get to hwy 50 to Jefferson
City.   In Union, MO, right at 44 & 50, I stopped at one of those 'Super"
Wally-Worlds.. I wanted to get me one of those swanky propane gas
camp-grills for the weekend, so I would never have to mess around with
charcoal and lighter fluid and all that mess ever again.  The Wally-World
was one of those mega-centers, with a super market, a Wal-Mart, Tire shop,
eye glass center, law firm, tractor repair, etc all in one.  So after the
mile hike to the camping goods, and not finding anything, then hiking to the
regular grill section, I found my grill. I nifty little until for only 17$.
I then had the privilege of standing in line behind 2 ma & pa Kettle types,
who must have been stocking up their Y2K shelters or something that weekend,
because they each had about 3 mega-Wally-Karts full of crap.  You see, in
Sam Waltons infinite wisdom, there are no separate check-out lines for the
grocery store, the Wally World, etc. so I get to stand in line for ( I swear
I am not making this up) one whole hour to buy my one damned grill for the
weekend.  (No, there were NO express lanes, just all regular lanes).  I was
in line SO long, I actually watched a shift-change of check-out girls!

I am NEVER going to a Wal-Mart again as long as I live.

So I continue on, navigating the curvy, rolling hills of hwy 50, with my
pathetic SP motor overheating, and barely pushing me along.  There was A LOT
of traffic backed up behind me at times, especially on the hills, and
several times I had to pull over to let them pass.  As I rolled into
Jefferson City - the capitol of Missouri - I kept a sharp eye out for my
turn south onto 54.  Only it turns out 54 is marked east and west, even
though it *distinctly* travels north & south on the map.  GGGRRRRRR...  I
miss my turn...   I turn around for a second pass...  and going from this
way, the exit is marked AFTER the turn-off, and you can't see it until
you're past it.  I miss it a third time.  Turn around again, this time
turning onto the West-bound ramp.... There is a turn you're supposed to make
on the ramp, but it's not well marked... and I miss it for a FOURTH time...
turn around again, and from this direction you CAN'T GET ON going west!!!
Well I'm pretty damned steamed by then, and so a couple of highly illegal
maneuvers later, I'm heading down highway 54 West (south).  Soon after, I
need gas, so I stop - I've only come about 100 miles.. man an I getting
crappy mileage! And then I'm back on the road.

I arrive at the camp-ground about 9PM or so, in utter darkness... I had
almost missed the turn to the camp-ground as well, since the road its on
wasn't on any maps, even my AAA Map 'N Go CD.  I pull up to the tent loop,
and there I see quite a few buses there already.. Pink Newell, Dave Filcoff,
a large Springfield contingent, and STEVE LASHLEY are there.. How the heck
did Steve get ahead of me? We went the same way, but I never saw him pass
me!  Oh well...  I pick a somewhat level spot, and start setting up camp.
There is plenty of open area to be found, all level for the most part, and
tons of picnic tables!  Usually campgrounds really skimp one those. Well,
they must have spent TOO much money on tables though, because there wasn't a
trash can in sight.   Setting up merely involved setting u my side-tent,
which went up in a few minutes, and I set about assembling my hard-earned
new camp-grill.  It was Bratwurst time dammit!</pre>
