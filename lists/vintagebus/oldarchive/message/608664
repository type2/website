   <i>2003-04-20 03:49:41+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>    And this is exactly where I am at.!!!   Drilled the cargo door screw
heads today (6 cargo door screws, one front door)  Now I will easy out
hopefully!  But I have all the doors off now and am happy about that.  ;^{)>
    Stripped the back inside roof as it has a lot of  bubble in the paint.
Picked up Metal Wiz's metal last week and have been looking at it.   The
cargo door replacement panels are pretty straight forward as they have a
front 10 inch piece and the back is just the bottom piece of the inside.
Doable?  The rockers and the long side panel 8" look doable but that piece
from Wolfsburg kind looks bay windowish in the little lip it has for its
rear fender well but doable.  The front floors are just a cut and paste!?
doable!?  The bottom 8 inches of the front of the bus aren't terrible but
there is rust behind that piece so got to work on that and I got a piece to
work in there.  Doable?!  Rear corners been pounded and are alot better than
they were but still are rust/ripped.  The old guy down at the shop came in
with some old lead that is supposed to be 1% silver and 1% tin especially
for autobody leading so he sat down with a propane torch and a wood stick
dipped in motor oil and showed me how to put lead into areas using flux core
solder for its tinning agent.  Pretty cool but I think I really need new
metal there.
    I got some used  corners from Metal Wiz but I don't think mine are bad
enough to not use! We'll see!!!   There is a new welder guy in the shop that
says that he will show me the settings and how to use the Miller on  sheet
metal.  A couple of years ago I took a sheet metal welding class and made a
sheet metal cube filled with water that didn't leak so I just need to sit
down with some scrap and work it till proficient again. So Doable!!
    I have to work on the A and B pillars and the bottom of the bulkhead.
Metal wiz sent these and the replacement for the bulkhead is pretty slick.
It will work for a bus that is rusted to that open foot area for the middle
seat passenger or the first bend towards the front of the bus.  It is 3
pieces and has 1 long middle piece and than 2 pieces that are formed for the
bends around what I call the middle seat passengers foot area.  This might
be tough but doable!?
    I hope to enclose the bus with some tarps and get in there and do some
sandblasting on the frame as I have some fish plating to do there.!
Doable!!?  And undercoating to  remove and see what metal is where.  Where
the undercoating has stuck the metal is virginal but where it hasn't it has
becoming pitted.  I have the whole bus stripped of metal but in the engine
bay where I hope to hit it with the sand blaster.
    Still need to remove the driver side battery tray and pound where it was
at to try and get the curve back in the corner.  I hate to tear up that tray
but the bus has a dent that crimped the tray right where it attaches to the
corner and I ordered one for it. If I can get it out nice I might just pound
it flat again and see about a reinstall ? Doable!!  The doglegs at the A
pillars are going to take a little custom work but there is a brake and a
shear here in the machine shop and I think I can patch something together
there as the outside piece by the cargo doors is perfect but the inside is
rough.  Going to be leading the holes around the skylights (Might need a
MetWiz replacement or 2 here) and along the rain gutter.  It isn't really
the rain gutter but about a inch above.  Don't know why but it is.  Doable!
Need to get the bus lowered after the frame sandblasting so I can push it
outside and wash it off with hot water and get the stripper out of all the
nooks and crannies.  Thinking about interiors I would like a Mosaic interior
so I could remove it and put in the regular passenger seats.  But than I
think Pimpdaddy and close my eyes.AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!. No STOCK!!  No
Pimpdaddy!  NO STOCK!!  Stock it is!!  With a custom mosaic!!!!
    Paint!  I bought a quart of some primer that my buddy said to get but I
need to read more about it.  I forget its name but will try and remember to
look it up!  Want to get something on the bare sheet metal before it gets
humid.   Hell its raining now!  Sit back and think about paint and your mind
just wanders. Stock  A red and Black 23 window sunroof of the 50's era.
Custom Bill board for rent to the local company that want to pay for
painting it!?  Custom 2 Patriotic flag paint emanating from the flag emblem
and being blown over the bus!  Custom 3 (My fav)  Fixing it all up and than
painting it so it looks like the day I bought it!  Painted rust and dents
and scratches!   I still got all the broken windows!?
    Alot of work done and much more to go but I feel good and am happy in
what I am doing!  People may look and laugh when they come in the racers
shop and see my poor rusted hulk but when it is done and we both pull in to
a local car show mine will be cool while his is just fast!  Something a old
VW doesn't want to be!  I have some picture updates (and video) that I will
try and get in a format that is easier for Gerald to update onto Gerald's
PDRob's site!   http://www.phorce1_dot_com/BSKA-pdrob/album.html   Click the
dates on the top of the page  Hopefully have a new April update soon   Well
I have been sanding tonight and it feels like my nose is hardening so I am
off to the shower!   Doable!!
Nite!
Rob
