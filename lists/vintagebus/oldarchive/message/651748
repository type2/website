   <pre>Hi woody and list after several contacts on this subject I thought I would
spill the beans, so here is our story-

Recently I have become without westy and needed to fix this situation pretty
fast as I was having withdrawal symptoms, so we started looking at the
different early westfalia campers that were available in the late 50s early
60s, checking the internet and seeing what was for sale.  Saw a few on the
internet but nothing looked to interesting.  Two weeks ago we went to the
New Mexico show- busses and balloons, after the show we went over to a
fellow bus enthusiast co-op and checked out his campers since we had not
actually seen these campers in person, and for the first time in person saw
the SO34 kit and knew at this time that this was the camper for us.  After
many failed attempts to buy his camper we were off to find our own.  Now
heres the cool part, on the way home from the busses and balloons event we
did the normal lets look into all the old junk yards and back yards and see
if over the years anyone has missed an old bus that would need saving,  All
the junk yards we saw had no signs of VWs in them until we passed one in St
johns Arizona where there were several beetles and some bay window buses,
maybe a source for PLF parts?  so we decided if we were going to have any vw
luck this trip this was it, as we were pulling over it looked like in the
junk yard next store there might be a split.  When we got out of the rusty
bus we started thru the bugs, 1 semaphore beetle and 1 ragtop were of the
interesting, we could see it was in deed a split window. Half way thru the
bugs and bay window buses we could see the roof wasn't a standard roof the
possibility of a flip hatch was making it self apparent, at this point we
stooped everything and ran over to see what the story was, as we got closer
you could see the 4 tent mounts on the roof and as we closed in on the bus
it was apparent there it was that highly sought after flip seat yes it was a
flip seat camper.  the bus was closed behind a chain link fence so we went
next door to the other junk yard found out when the help would be in and
went and had breakfast (I must say that was the best eggs and toast with
jelly I have ever had)  We got back to the junk and talked to the help and
we were informed the bus had been sitting there for 16 years at least
(amazing no one else had never seen this bus).  The rear end of the bus was
lacking tranny therefore the spring plates were sitting in the dirt for who
knows how long, rusted rockers and dog legs but for some weird reason the
floors are all almost perfect, except where the rockers are missing.  Other
than missing the kit and rockers it's pretty sound, oh yeah and the missing
metal above the engine =(.  Nothing that cant be fixed hopefully.  Went back
and talked to the help as the owner was out sick that day, he gave the owner
a call and a price was set,  when the help gave us the price he looked
pretty amused that we would even be interested in that old vw, but hello
flip seat camper yeah!  Anyway the price was given and as fast as you can
imagine we were at the ATM machine getting the cash to seal the deal.  Kinda
know what the value of the flip seat itself was and having a great flip
hatch and seeing what they sell for it seemed like a great deal!  Yes it
needs work and the long hard journey to find the interior,  but being that
the day after we decided to purchase a flip seat we found one and have seen
a few for sale since finding the interior doesn't seem impossible (yeah do
any of you wonderful people have any leads on a SO 34 westfalia interior
"the white one").  Oh yeah by now your probably wondering how much well I
hope$50.00 wasn't toooo much whacha think?  Ok we went up last weekend
rented a truck threw a tranny in and used a tow bar and brought it home, it
was here by Sunday morning.  We left on Friday night to go retrieve the bus
and slept in the front of the pickup on the way, we woke up in time to get
to St johns by the time the junkyard opened.  We spent all day putting the
new tranny in so we would have wheels to roll on so we could use the tow bar
as there were few other options on how to get it home.  Had the tranny in by
4ish no problems except trying to find reduction box bolts in a small town
in the middle of no where,  Napa was open on Saturday so we were set.  took
about an hour or so to get the trailer light to function and headed home.
Slept again in the front of the truck Saturday night, and woke up early
Sunday morning, the only problem on the way home the make shift wing nuts on
the flip hatch came loose and you could see the hatch shaking, easily fixed.
Then about 10 mile from the house the cargo doors opened, we were at a on
ramp and were able to jump out and resecure the doors.  All in all a good
trip home no real problems no flat tires and best of all I once again have
my westy urges satisfied.  Now the proud owners of a 1962 flip seat camper
how cool is that
