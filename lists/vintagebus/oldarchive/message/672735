   <pre>[...]This is the story of Bessie my 67 splitty that i just purchased--actually
when i contacted the owner the bus was already sold for parts!!! but when they
found out i was going to put Bessie back on the road -just as she toured
America--they gave the money back to the 1st buyer and sold it to me--i feel very
fortunate to be able to own a great bus with a most colorfull past of joy!!--Uncle
