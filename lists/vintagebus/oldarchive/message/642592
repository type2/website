   <pre>This is a trip report that will eventually be posted to the buskatiers
website.  There will be pictures up but as of this writing, the mention of
them in this article is a bit premature so please ignore those references.
This happened on March 17th, 2001.  Thought you would enjoy reading this.
================================================================
Buskatier's Fun Day at Rick Taylor's bus farm.

(3-17/3-18-01)It had been a mere 4 weeks since we had been down in the
Kansas City area for the wonderful heater seminar that Rick, Pink, and the
KC Kombis had put on. I had told Rick at that time that I was interested in
his lone double-cab and would like to skit down there at the next possible
opportunity to check it out. I had planned for 3 weeks from that date and
the weather dictated that it be 4. As it worked out, Rob and Justin and our
bus-wannabe friend Kevin wanted to go along and I was more than pleased to
have them along as I travel alone in my bus most of the time when I go
places.

Friday turned out to be a rather nice day and after work I immediately took
care of things like getting gas, oil, supplies, and heading to the car wash.
When I arrived home at 7:15, the gang was already here. I didn't plan on
them showing up until 8:00 or after so it was a nice surprise to see that
they had beat me home. It necessitated that I step up the pace a little bit
and get things packed so we could head out. Within an hour we were packed
and I'm sure the guys appreciated the work I had done the day before on the
seatcover on the rear seat. The vinyl is so dry and brittle it's flaking
off and looking like a mouse nest. At least now I don't have to look at it!
:-)

As we left, Rob made the comment that he hadn't eaten and as a matter of
fact, nobody had. We ended up at Burger King - putting down some of their
delicacies and by 9:00 we were on the road, heading south on U.S. 77. Road
construction which commenced March 8th made us take a detour on rough gravel
roads but once we hit the highway, everything was kosher. Just outside of
Marysville, we heard a sound on the roof and come to find out, one of the
chains from the towbar had come loose and danced a jig in the wind up there.
We had just been chatting about the guy who was killed and whose body had
been carted off in my bus about 16 years ago so immediately we thought that

maybe he was knocking on the roof! :-) The towbar and the potato cannon
were still securely fastened to the roof so we were "all systems go." We
avoided the trains that go through Marysville every 15 to 20 minutes and
kept on going east on U.S. 36 until we came to the little town of Seneca.
Bladders and munchies had us stopping so I gave Rick a call on the cell
phone. It was 10:00 by now and Rick said we were still 2 hours out. We
proceeded on to Fairview. That is where we picked up highway 75 and headed
south. We passed the Sac & Fox casino on the reservation and I had to think
about how similar this was to the trip I took from Havasu to Vegas in the
early morning hours back in January amidst casinos. Gas here was $1.21 a
gallon but we didn't stop as we had enough to take us all the way to
suburban Topeka.

I had warned the guys that the bus does get cold even with temps as high as
in the 60's because the induced wind chill robbing heat from the bus via
leaky seals and raw cooling power can be a force to be reckoned with. Rob
and Justin kind of curled up in the back seat under a sleeping bag and
managed to sleep off the trip down there hit or miss. Kevin was up front
with me and since he can sing and carry a tune rather well, we sang a lot
and even did harmonies. I enjoy someone who can sing good enough to do
2-part-harmonies - it's a rare treat for me!</pre>
