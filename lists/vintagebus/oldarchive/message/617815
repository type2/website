   <pre>Ya Brian,,, but YOU just *pass out* ;-) ontop of all this stuff when YOU hit 
the sack! Don't forget that Great big dangerous German Flag You have Brian. 
Hmmm scared that Ghia away...(inside joke Brian can explain)


Hi all!
I just had to *kid* with Brian, actually he does have all this stuff and 
room for the dog too. I was so surprised by what could fit into a Bus that i 
couldn't resist adding my 2Â¢
When we first got our Westy, my Wife and I were discussing what we had 
onhand to put in the camper for our first trip, and I was wondering what I 
would need in the event of a breakdown. She was quite happey to have me 
*take off* (I think those where her exact words) to get some spares. When I 
returned she had all the camping gear spread out in the house, all over the 
kitchen, dining room AND the living room! I think my comment was "Remember 
Honey, It is only a small camper,,,,, and WE have to fit in!" Umm, I better 
not type what she told me THEN! Other than "Remember! WE have FIVE of 
everything, unless you want me to leave YOUR stuff behind!" So I went to  
pack my list of spares and things like, 4 short 2x6's to level the camper, 
my stunt kites (8ft wingspan), kids driving games, artificial turf carpet to 
keep the kids from dragging in the great outdoors on their feet etc. I have 
since added, 5 bicycles to the rear bumper,(2 full size and 3, 16" kids 
bikes), And a canvas bag that holds the lawn chairs and the BBQ on the roof 
rack.
The only thing I scrimped on was the spare tire,,, I took a spare tire in a 
can... I still havn't had to use that, <fingers crossed>
Well, I left the farm for a few hours to get some supplies and when I came 
back, I peeked into the Westy to see how far She had got, hmmm nothing new 
in here, so I went into the house and there was nothing there???  uh Oh! she 
got mad and put it all away,?? Hmm, I looked around and found her gathering 
up the swimming gear, (oops, I forgot that) So I asked where all the camping 
stuff was? Did she want me to load it?  SHE SAID "It is all put in the 
Camper DEAR!"  *MY eyes open wide* Really??? I just looked there, where did 
you put it all??
..........<mean stare from a Woman scorned> JUST get in, shut UP and DRIVE!  
:-) She is so cute when she is the Boss.
Back to my point... we , err She got enough gear into the Westy to keep 3 
kids and a Hubby happy, food, toys, clothes etc and tools and spares also! I 
was getting worried, What does this VW weight now and what is the max. 
carrying capacity??? So, as we have a truck scale in the gravel pit behind 
us, I weighed it!  Glad I got new Continental Contact Tires with the 1540lb 
rating, This Westy weighed in at 5180_lbs!!! yeee, that is sooo close to 
1300_lbs / tire,,,
Anyways, It didn't seem to be all that bad driving this much weight.And it 
was quite comfortable to drive and sleep in that we have spent 7 more years 
doing it! never needed the tools to do repairs, but they come in handy for 
other things while camping.
I really believe in what Paul wrote: "Why not do a walk-around each time you 
drive the vehicle, and set up monthly and/or other frequencies of 
maintenance checks.  I check out essential items before I drive it each time 
and make sure I go over the entire vehicle about every 8 weeks."
That is exactly what I do , so i can just jump in and go on the spur of the 
moment... 14hr drive "LEAVE NOW, SLEEP WHEN YOU GET THERE"

GONE Camping!
