   <h1>Another Search and Rescue!!</h1>

   <br/>
   <pre>Hi all,

Well, I have completed my first search and rescue.  Recently I joined
the SV2's here in So cal.  (Great Group)  After the first meeting I
talked with a few of the members and one said that he had a '59 front
end (hub to hub) that I could have for $20.  Score!  Plus they lived
about ten miles from my house.  I also learned that his wife was the
treasurer for the club and also took care of new members. (Yes this is
all relevant, read on).  So on the following weekend I picked up what
turned out to be a 65 front end and a '59 rear end.  ( You never know
when that will come in handy).  Well last Saturday, I drove over to his
house again to drop off my membership dues.  As I turned a corner, and
looked down a dirt road I saw a white split in front of somebody's
house.  Returning from droping off the dues, I drove by again, and
turned down the road.

Upon first glance, all of the side windows and back window had been
busted out (windshields intact), and it was missing the passenger door.
Some pretty serious cancer in the front and back of the roof, no engine,
cut stereo hole, and like most Search and Rescue operations, it had
"Sheditis".  On the up side.  It was a walk through, had a 2/3 metal
rack, has a transaxle, and was a split.  That in itself is worth further
investigation.  After leaving a note on it I returned home figuring that
somebody had just got it and was going to restore it, but would find out
for sure.

I went back later to find out more.  I lucked out and found the guy
(Jim) who's house it was parked in front of and started up a little
confab.  He said that he had called the city and they were coming for it
next week.  Oh crap!  He also told me that the kids up the hill brought
it down and left it.  After a bit more speakage, jim and I were on our
way up the hill.  The story I got, was that one of the kids cousins
brought it too their house and left it.  They got tired of it sitting
there and wheeled it down the hill.  "How about the paperwork on it?"
"Oh it's out of the books I think" they tell me.  "Well can I have it."
Sure go for it.

Uh oh, the girlfriend is going to be pissed.  I already have one project
taking up all my time and money ('59), now I have another one.  After
returning home, I find that my roomate has just sold his Camero and
there is an empty spot in the garage.  Oh baby this is an omen if I've
ever had one.  This is meant to be.  But it would have to wait until the
next day (sunday) as we were already late for a party.  The whole time,
all I could think about was the bus.  BLA BLA BLA, Words Words Words,
and all I could think was, please let me get it in my garage.  Bright
and early Sunday, I picked up the tow dolly, a buddy and a pissed off
girlfriend.  (She thought that it was a good idea, that if I get
something, she should be able to get a new cat.  Huh What, veto that
idea.  I am not married, and don't need to give in.  I also don't need a
new pet.  I have too much to worry about with a new bus what is she
thinking.)   ;-)

After and hour of replacing rims and tires, and loading we were on our
way.  Thankfully, we had a very uneventful trip, just narrowly avoiding
disaster, with the cargo doors opening.  They weren't latched and I
didn't check them.  When we pulled in front of the house, I noticed one
of the many seats had moved and was propt up against the doors almost
opening them.  It was home and could finally be further inspected.
Results:  The rack is pretty rusty, but can be saved, the headliner is
in great shape, most of the interior body panels are there, and it was a
red and white stripped canopy type thing in it.  The canopy is a little
haggard, but with a little clean up, won't be too bad.  The dash is
relatively unmangled and had every thing but the gas guage and what ever
is next to it.  But all three switches were there with knobs, and even
the little interior light switch was there.</pre>
