   <h1>NQ/Buskateers Scout out Indian Cave State Park (report on wknd trip.)</h1>
   <b>&quot;No Quarter&quot; &lt;silent_at_beatricene_dot_com&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2000-10-05 02:11:47+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Since representatives of the Omaha VW Club and Kansas City VW Club decided
we ought to get together for a campout, the scouting missions were put into
motion. Pink Newell and Rick Taylor of KCMO and Topeka, KS scouted out
Indian Cave State Park in South Eastern Nebraska (about 70 miles east of me)
2 weeks ago and finally, this weekend, the Nebraska contingents scoped out
the park as well and actually camped out in it to get a feel of the area. It
was said more than once over our weekend that Indian Cave State Park is
Nebraska's best kept secret and could very well be Nebraska's most
beautiful, intruguing, mysterious, and interesting park in the state.
I got a late start Friday evening and didn't arrive at the campgounds until
10:00 but ended up driving around the maze of roads in the park for another
hour before I found Terry Wolfe, Kevin (Iowa bus wannabe), and Rob and
Justin Laffoon. I kept pulling over, looking at my map trying to find out
where I was and where they might be. We all grossly underestimated the size
of the park - it's much larger than we thought.
I finally turned into one of the campgrounds and saw Terry Wolfe flagging me
down. There was a lot of relief when I showed up because nobody knew for
sure if I was broke down or not but there I was so after bullshipping around
for a while close to the fire, we started getting ready for bed. Rob and
Justin took the back of the single cab, Terry in his Westy, and Kevin
Sullivan and I shared the tent on lumpy ground. Condering my newcomer status
to camping I slept decent and kept warm with plenty of clothes and blankets.
The next morning we had breakfast and started our little caravan to just
outside the park to the little cafe that made great biscuits and gravy 4
years ago. It's permanently closed by what the little old lady in the craft
shop said. I think she was the old gal that ran it so maybe it was getting
too much for her. The next closest eating joint is a good 20 to 25 miles
away.
Back into the park we went, Rob assuming the lead as usual, Terry in the
middle, and me with my 1776, freeway flyer, and tall tires in the rear so I
don't blow everyone away. It was neat once again to see the the caravan
meandering around the twists and turns of the park which was very
reminiscent of the BNNTA event. We did a lot of scouting trying to find the
best location(s) for the campout and have settled on one location with the
possibility of a few other backup locations just in case.
I forget what order we did all this stuff in but suffice to say we really
covered this park and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  We visited the cave
which was more like a big shale/sandstone hollow in the side of a cliff
which is a rare to non-existant feature in Nebraska.  It's definitely not a
"cave" in the traditional sense.  The soft material has lent itself many
people leaving their mark - anything from the first primitive petroglyphs
depicting buffalo to the Dave loves Sally of modern times which sadly has
defaced most of the old signatures.  I did find my last name up on the rock
with a date of 1912 which was extremely interesting.  The old cave also
served as pow-wow and town meeting HQs from the defunct town of St. Deroin
so there are a lot of signatures from that era as well.  The nice wooded
walkway made walking up to the cave a breeze and it looked great too!
We continued our cruise through the park looking for a great Bustober site
and for a photoshoot.  We traveled the only gravel road in the park to the
boat dock and took some outstanding photos.  You'll notice on the website of
photos (courtesy Terry Wolfe) that we got some GREAT photos - great enough
for calendar or T-Shirt status IMHO.  We even had Justin standing on Kevin's
shoulders next to a telephone pole for some of the "aerial" shots. :-)
After the photo session was done, we worked our way to the one-way winding
path that slithers around in the northern end of the park.  This path is
awesome!  Cut into the sandy soil is a little one-way, one lane, narrow
pathway that wonders up, down, right, left, through the woods.  At some
points, the wall of soil on either side of the road is so tall, if you were
standing on the top looking down, you could jump on top of the vehicles as
they passed by!  We really enjoyed the caravan and this will be one of our
event highlights - a big old caravan on this road.  There is a playground
along the road and some historic interest sites along the way.  Trail
starting points are also found along the road.  It is along one of the
little trails we stopped at that had a nice little food bridge with little
shacks and a cabin on the other side.  There were women inside the shacks
making candles and soap.  The blacksmiths shop was closed down but the
little one room cabin was quite a site - just to think our ancestors lived
this way in the pursuit of free land.  We also walked to the little general
store and school - the only remaining vestiges of the little "half-breed"
town called St. Deroin which the Missouri River all but eradicated in the
early 1900s.  At this point, I must explain the use of the term
"half-breed."  In this in age, one would refer to such people as ones of
mixed race or in a more polite and civilized term such as one whose parents
are of ethnic diversity or some such name.  The reason why it's called a
"half-breed" town is because as white settlers migrated out West, there
weren't many women unless you liked Indians.  Without going into much
detail, there were lots of half Indian and half settler children running
around of which neither Indians nor Whites would accept.  Joseph Deroin, a
"half-breed" himself, saw a need to provide and he started his own town - a
safe haven for Whites, Indians, and all of their offspring.  The school
provided well for these children and thanks to Joseph, those people were
finally accepted and integrated into White society.  The Indians of course
wanted nothing to do with the white man but we know how history ended up in
this regard.
We finished the historical area and proceeded to the scenic overlook (also
found on the website).  This area was absolutely beautiful and can only be
experienced in full in person.  As we walked around a did some minor hiking
on the trails, we had a few people ask us if there was a VW show going on
and as we caravanned hither around the park, we would see people taking our
pictures and even stopping quickly on the side of the road to get a snap
shot.  We had a blast!
Of interest too was the St. Deroin cemetary.  There are a lot of children
buried here due to a cholera outbreak  at the time.  Also of interest was
the broze plated stone where Ray Dean Weddle wrote his own epitaph.  The guy
sounded to me like quite a character.  You can read his epitaph on page one
of the website.
Before leaving, we visited the museum which told all kinds of awesome
history on the area enclosed in the park.  It's your basic state park musem
but there are some neat displays and exhibits to see on the way out.

The next stop was the small town of Stella where we found the one-pump gas
station for Rob.  Gas was high priced here but it's justified by Stella's
strategic location.  One word of advice to all attending the event, fill
your gas tanks in Auburn, NE or Rockport, MO - you've got a 25 mile drive to
the nearest pump!

From Stella we went to Auburn, ate, took the photo of Kevin on the army
tank, and headed north towards Omaha.  We stopped at an a produce store on
the way back.  Southest Nebraska contains many apple orchards so the little
mom and pop produce stands are running in full force.  Gitcher cider,
pancake mix, fruits, berries, carmel apples, and other apple-based goods
here!

Finally as evening approached, we stopped to visit a little VW junkyard
outside of Omaha and then progressed on, eventually splitting up with Terry
as one and all headed home for the evening.  I played a little guitar and
piano at Robs before heading for bed.

The next morning we got up and made it to the Aksarben swap meet at 7:30.
We found a lot of neat stuff here.  The swap meet was absolute huge - bigger
than I've ever been too.  I'll spare all the details but here's what I got:

A "Foxcraft" roof rack, new in the box for a VW beetle for $5.  The guy
tossed in a VW steering wheel and plastic emblem.  The rack is very
interesting but extremely clunky in design.  Can you say, "Metal shelving
and Sears Craftsman table saw table?"  I hope Rob will get some pictures of
this extremely clunky and funny looking beetle accessory.  I ended up
trading it off for a Stewart Warner Southwind Gas Heater out of a 40's and
50's Chevy/Ford.  These are really simple 6v heaters that would work
absolutely awesome in the cab of single cab bus or in a bug for that matter
if you could find a place to mount it.  It's small, needs a fuel line run to
it, and has a little exhaust pipe on it.  I'm sure the suckers gets hot!
Anyway, I grabbed a couple of original General Lee ERTL cars and a beetle
toy.  I also came away vowing I'll make me a powered Radio Flyer wagon not
only to give my feet a rest, but to have a novel way of traveling around at
campsites and future flea markets!  I already bought the wagon - the
"Colusses" from Harbor Freight! :-)</pre>
