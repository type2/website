   <h1>Past few days of 67 bus updates (LONG)</h1>
   <b>&quot;No Quarter&quot; &lt;silent_at_beatricene_dot_com&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2000-03-12 15:35:10+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Wow - after working like a madman on getting this 1600DP engine running, I
finally got it purring like clockwork (after sitting for 3 years) on the
garage floor.  My biggest snag by far was the 38amp bus generator/backing
plate fiasco.  Not even the guru could help me 'without looking at it first'
and since I didn't feel like driving 5 miles one way with a bunch of greasy
parts, I figured I'd work it out myself.  Now for you archivists out there,
you must save this next part of the message because you don't run across
this info that often.
===
The 12v/38 bus generator (I believe it's found from 1967 to 1971) is longer
than the beetle generator.  To accomodate this extra length, you must use an
offset backing plate (it's recessed to allow the generator to intrude a bit
deeper into the fan shroud), (here's the kicker) an offset HUB on the
front (Front Is Front) of the generator, AND either a big stack of shims or
the
real thick shim/washer that VW included with this setup which eliminates the
need for a huge stack of the thinner shims.  The hub allows the the fan to
actually sit a lot closer to the generator than what is allowed on a beetle
generator.
===
I couldn't figure out why after putting the bus backing plate on the
generator, why I still was bottoming out on the shroud.  My backing plate
was 1/4" from
the shroud and the fan was hitting the shroud.  As subtle as it was, the fan
HUB was the ticket - it allowed the fan to sit a good 1/4" closer to the
generator and bingo - it fit like a glove.

After this fiasco was solved, I double checked my fuel lines to make sure
they weren't reversed, put the battery on the charger, hooked up all my
wiring, tightened up the belt (which was so straight, I had to take out 2
shims to take up the slack gained by straigtening up the generator.), and
proceeded to add gas to the carb a few drips at a time between starts.
Eventually I got the air out of the system and the engine ran.  I played
around with the dizzy and the 34-pict-3 and got the engine to settle into a
nice warm fuzzy idle.  Despite the rusty exhaust system and the oil smoke
burnoff, it ran really quiet on the creeper on the garage floor - just
purring - thanking me for bringing it back to life. :-)  It was missing on
one cylinder which I'm almost positive is a problem with the crappy wires
and plugs so I'll put some new ones on tomorrow and set the timing and then
I should have a good used 1600DP to use for backup in case the 1776 blows
up. :-)
=======================================================
Thanks to all of you who replied, I came to the conclusion that the problem
with the eaten clutches and throwout bearing mishaps was because the cross
shaft was mis-aligned in relation to the input shaft of the tranny.  Tonight
I buckled down and studied how the who appartus works and then promptly
removed the cross shaft.  Using washers as shims, I was able to knock the
side to side play down to 1/32" from 1/8".  The 11mm bolt that holds the
left bushing in place in the trans wasn't quite doing its job because the
receiving hole in the bushing was wallered out (and it still is) and allowed
the bushing to float side to side.  I also filed a new set of grooves in
the cross shaft arms for the release bearing spring clips to sit.  The old
grooves were worn deep enough that the springs couldn't do their job of
holding the bearing in place.  The name of the game here is saving money
because it's dumb to sink additional dough into a rear end when I've got one
already built.

Oh and did I mention that I found a little 3.5 lb mini sledge sitting on top
of the tranny?  It had been there a while (as evidenced by the gunk buildup
and rode the 70 some miles back to Beatrice without falling off.  My brother
made some comment about the work ethics of the last owner/mechanic that
worked on the bus.  Come to think of it, Judith did talk about hitting the
starter with a hammer on occasion to get it to turn over.  Maybe she dropped
it or forgot about it because it just laid there close to the starter with
nothing
to secure it.

(an additional note here about that sledge - I've used it a lot in the past
coupe of days - it really is a handy little tool - I think this is more
karma coming into play. :-)

And finally, after new plugs, wires, setting the timing, checking dwell, and
adjusting the accelerator pump, I've now got a healthy little 1600DP sitting
on the creeper on the garage floor that runs like champ - the choke makes it
idle fast at startup, and then as it warms up, the choke goes all the way
open.  It just needs a thermostat and a real good cleaning and it'll be a
good little runner/backup engine once the 1776 needs to go the 67.
======================================================
Not being totally satisfied with the results of my efforts last night at
repairing the cross shaft in the tranny, I pulled the appartus apart again.
I marked and drilled a new hole in the main cross shaft bushing (the part
closest to the clutch arm) and upon reassembly, I observed a perfectly
centered set of release bearing arms with very very little side to side
play.  The main problem was an oblong hole in this main bushing and a groove
in the 11mm head securing bolt.  With everything straight and true again, it
appears I've more than likely fixed the clutch problem with this bus.  I
yoiked the gas tank tonight and tomorrow I'll power wash the engine bay.  In
the morning I'm driving to Frank Musil's in Lincoln, NE to get some new
swing-axle boots.  Hopefully by evening, I'll have the gas tank pulled out
of the 66 and moved over to the 67 (the nice 15 gallon extra range tank!)
Although this bus is a 67 and the gas tank had the sending unit installed,
the tank is not a hump-back tank.  Also, for setting empty for 3 years, the
tank has very little internal rust.  There is probably an area about 14
inches by 5 inches that is surface rusty but the rest of it looks like nice
clean metal.

Anyway, that was it for tonight.  Got a late start and hurt my leg today so
that slowed me down.  More later...
===================================
And then the next article is the first one that came thru after the list
went back online.
===================================
One more little tidbit I'd like to share with all of you.  Since bringing
this bus home, there is been an aura of death in the area.  In the past few
days alone, there has been a botched burglary of a pickup that resulted in
the pursuing woman getting shot and killed in her car, a kid near Adams, NE
rolled his car and laid there for an unknown length of time before being
found and sent in serious condition to the Lincoln hospital (which I later
heard he died but that may be remour), and a contractor's son (The
contractor does business with us at the lumber yard) was DWI'ing and wrecked
his car and was killed.  The latter accident serves as a soapbox for me
because the younger guys at work think I'm weird for not drinking nor
wanting to.  They laugh about minor driving mishaps and other "fun" things
that happen.  I'm not against beer/alcohol but I am against the nonchalant
attitude in this area about underage drinking and drinking in excess (ie.
stoned, plastered, drunk off your ass, etc.)  All I had to say to the guys
yesterday about this kid they knew that died was, "And you guys think I'm a
stupid freak for not drinking - I'm alive aren't I?"  Of course they had
nothing to say.</pre>
