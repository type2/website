   <h1>my Classic weekend? long for you Tom</h1>
   <b>Old Volks &lt;general_at_oldvolks_dot_com&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2005-06-17 15:51:37+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>   It all started like any other Classic weekend or show weekend, busting ass for days and nights getting a bus ready 
that you swore you have ready weeks before the Classic, well that didn't happen and I finished getting the swivel seat 
ready 10 pm the night before we left.
    5 a m Friday Morning 4 of us from Havasu meet up to make the JOURNEY. John VW Howard (yes he's back after a 
couple years off) in his 62 DD WT panel, Cory in the Screaming Eagle 64 panel, Steve driving my 60 DD panel and me 
in my 60 Swivel seat Kombi.
   So down the highway we go crusing and enjoying the drive. All of us have bigger engines in our buses except for 
VW Howard who had a stock 1600 so Steve and I would pull away and wait for Cory and John at the next predesinated 
stop.
    At the next stop (Desert Center, the gas station and bahtrooms are now closed) Steve and I wauted for John and 
Cory again and a few minutes later they arrived. John's bus was pinging a little so he retrded the timing a little and 
checked his oil, quart low.
    All fixed and ready to go again we all take off, up Chirico summit, again Steve and I pulled ahead, uphill for miles 
and about half way up I get a phone call, John blew up his engine!!!!! I asked if he need any help and he said no, Cory 
was with him and he was going to just get his bus toed home and call it a weekend.
    Steve and i continue to the bottom of the hill and I talk to John and a friend is going to come get him. THEN I 
remembered I had a spare engine in the shop and told John so he got hold of his friend (Matt the original owner of the 
Screaming Eagle) and changed plans to pick up the spare engine get it in the bus and continue.
   So Cory continued on and met up with us. I called John to let him know Cory made it and he said he allready had his 
old engine out!!!!.
   Off the 3 of us go ready to get to the VTO camp-out and wait for John to arrive.
   I decided then to blow off going to WCC open house and just relax and wait for John to show up and for the 
AWESOME VTO food.
   A few hours later John arrived, the spare engine puring like a kitten and all was well.

   Steve and I left the camp-out at around 8pm or so to head to OCTO to do my job there of helping setting up the lot 
and helping with parking in the morning.

  Saturday morning rolls around and here they come, the OCTOites. As always with OCTO it went smooth and quick, 
slowly filling up the lot. Weather was nice and cool and everybody we all seem to know were there, a huge, great 
show.

  After OCTO again I decided to blow off the other activities of the weekend, toy show, BDM BBQ, Berg rally and 
headed straight to the camp-out to relax and do nothing, I thought! Heading back to the camp-out my swivel seat 
started to lose power and run worse and worse. I nursed it up to the camp out and proceeded to work on it and 
discovered that the cam had gone flat on 1 and 3 cylinders and we all know buses don't run well on 2 cylinders.
  As I sit there and figure out what I am going to do Franklin from Franklins VW works (whos narrowed beam was on 
one of my buses) offered to tow my bus somewhere to be rescued at a later date. A little thought of where to take it I 
came up with Big hair Bob's house from VTO he lives only 40 miles from the camp-out. 
   We load it on Franklins trailer and off we went, 2 hours r/t and my bus is safely stored untill I can pick it up.
   The rest of the evening was mellow with th always fun VTO X rated night time raffle and the fanous poker game.

   Woke up Sunday morning and headed out to the Classic, got there around 8 am and ro my amazzment NO LINES,
proceed in (now with only 1 bus) and parked with the Las Vegas bus/vw club. What a great bunch of  guys and gals, 
cool buses from rats to some of the nicest buses we will ever see. Can't wait for Vegas show in October just to hang 
with these guys again.
   This years Classic seemed different then all the rest I have been too, very mellow. Swaps were very weak with all 
the same people as always seliing the same stuff it seems I saw there last year. I did find a few good goodies but no 
great scores as in years past.

   After the Classic I decided to just head home instead of doing the after show, show so off we went. 5 hours later 
we're back in Havasu relaxing again.
   6 a m Monday I headed out with the truck and trailer to go and pick up the swivel seat, another 500 miles r/t but the 
bus and I are home safe and sound and looking foeward to the next show, VW Panic, Familianfest, Bandimier and who 
knows what else.</pre>
