   <pre>Hi Mike!
I wrote this to let people know , I think it is worth it to have a
splittie bus, and i'll keep mine 6 volt!
The mechanical part is easy, it is the body work that drives me insane!
I live in Southern Ontario Canada, about 3 hours from Detroit.

Late last year (98) I located a 62 Deluxe hardtop Bus In Texas, and
after a quite a few calls to the East coast and the West
coast, Every one told me that theirs was sold, or needed rust repairs,
etc. My Dad and Brother were fed up hearing me yak
about my reason's for owning a splittie Bus, so they engaged in a 2 on
one conversation,  more like a 20 question barrage of
"when are you going to get it, ? etc." I had a few problems to over
come, like Cost $ , a tow vehicle, etc., but in a very few
minutes they had answered my questions with positive answers :-). Being
a thursday evening, none of us had to work till
Monday morning, and I had already used mapquest_dot_com to plan the trip, I
bluffed them with... OK! Let's GO RIGHT NOW!
... my SURPRISE! they said OK!!!
7:00pm Thurs.- My Dad used his 91 F_at_RD Crown Victoria to go get a car
dolly trailer and meet back at my house, I headed
to the bank for the U.S. money, and then home. I packed a bag of
munchies for the trip. Then I made a pile of tools to take:
4 spare tires (I didn't have 5 hole rims) ,
2 tire irons (to change tires),
8 lb sledge hammer with an 18" short handle (helps to free up stuck
brake drums, installing tires on rims, and any other things
needing persuading)
Wheel wrenches Valve stems and valve stem tool , duct tape
Tow chains, 2 come-a-longs ,a handful of tie down straps, the material
kind that truckers use, and of course the cell phone. I
grabbed a quick shower.
On the previous evening I had told the vendor via email that I wouldn't
be able to make it anytime soon, I didn't get a good
feeling of sending a cash deposit, and he had a chance to place it in a
swap meet. :-(  So I said if you don't sell it this weekend
to call me! I quickly sat down in front of the PC and sent a retraction!
I left my cell phone number and a place I would be
visiting on the way to his house. Grabbed all the pertinent info, just
in time to meet my Dad pulling in the Driveway.
9:00pm Thurs. -all tools loaded, camera, money, munchies in hand, the 3
of us headed out!
11:00pm Thurs.- still in CANADA, very close to Detroit, the phone rings!
The vendor has received my email, but the bus has
already been shipped to Arlington Texas Swap meet area. That is Ok, as
it is about 2 hours closer. So ,as he hadn't been to
Arlington , I got some vague details, and he said he'd call me back with
more details the next morning. Great! :-) !!
11:45 Thurs. -grabbed a coffee at the Border, changed drivers and set
the cruise control again!
7:00pm Fri. The next night, and no phone calls yet?, we pulled into
Dallas, stopped for a sub sandwich, what an ordeal trying
to pronounce "white" as in bread, so she didn't think I was saying
"wheat" as in whole wheat bread! She asked me 5
times..."white or white bread?" and i replied "white!" :-) well it was a
laff then, we had a short visit with my Aunt, then headed
for The swap meet. This part is a story in itself! I knew it was at the
Rangers Stadium ...period! We found the stadium fine, but
no "large swap meet"? A short drive around and still looking we asked a
group of people near the SIX FLAGS amusement
park for directions, they pointed us up the street to the lights at
Copeland St., turn left and drive right up to it. Great! :-) we
drove up the street but came to a gate with a security guard? HUH? My
brother was going to detour before entering the fenced
area as it looked intimidating, but I suggested it looked like there was
a turn around area just inside the gate, drive up to the
guard and ask for directions again. We asked Her for the location of the
swap meet? and she didn't know about it? hmmm so I
asked her how to get to Copeland St.? She was still confused so I
explained the directions of the last people, which seemed to
send us into the fenced area? She said that she didn't know where we
were going but to drive AHEAD to the lights,,,? huh
Couldn't see any lights? She said the street right ahead was Copeland
and there are lights, blocked from view by the interstate
bridge. I SAID "WHAT STREET?" She replied "Well that is Copeland, with a
"c" not a "k"" sir...All three of us looked at each
other, confused as we hadn't spelled the street name??? Darn Canadian
accent again eh! OH Well! With a "Thank YOU very
much!" we continued. Lights, left and 1 block later! Bingo!!! :-) The
swap meet! It was just getting Dark and they were closing
the swap area, at this point only open for vendors setting up. The gate
man allowed us to go in to turn around, and we did that,
about 100 times, up and down the aisles turning around at the ends and
searching! MAN! NOTHING! HUH! Oh no! It was
getting late, dark, and NO LUCK, so we headed back to the Aunt's. Had a
great time yakking then got some sleep.
7:00am Sat. I made some calls to the vendors phone number, HIS WIFE
ANSWERED! phew, confirmation that the bus was
at the swap with the vendor and they were staying at the hotel in the
same parking lot. With this info, We left Dad behind to
keep Auntie company and headed out to the swap meet again, this time we
found the swap as did everyone else,,,very busy
place. But there! on the corner! was The BUS! Yahoo! I inspected it and
it was exactly as the pictures showed! www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers
The transaction happened and we found a empty lot near by to transfer
the  bus from their trailer. Grrr! the rear drum was seized! A
few thumps with  the sledge... no luck! aahhh! Gee,I didn't want to tow
it with the gear reduction rear axles spinning anyways,
but towing a vehicle backwards is a nightmare at any speed, and I could
imagine the trip home at 40 mph!! :-( Oh well, i had
other option if necessary. So we put it on the dolly backwards,
tightened the straps, tied the steering wheel, put on the tow light
bar, and headed off to pick up Dad. 30 mph...ok... 40 mph,, fine... 50
mph, gee, still doing great! then a merge ramp with a
downhill grade bumped the coasting speed up to about 55 mph and HOLY
CROW!!!  THE BIG, DITCH TO DITCH
DAAAANCE! We were just entering a 5 lane wide hiway, and as the other
road merged from the right, we were in the center
lane.... going too slow for the surrounding traffic and swinging from
what felt like guardrail to guardrail!!  With some white
knuckles and fancy driving, My Brother got it pulled over! Thank gawd
for low budget stock car diving experience! A check of
everything offered no reason for the sway? We thought that the steering
wheel tie strap had broken loose. The only thing that we
could figure was the little bit of play in the steering box, so to
eliminate that, we tied the tie rod ends together, wrapping the
strap around the beam a few times  and put a come-a-long from the strap,
tight to the rear frame. Then with our fingers
crossed, we re-entered the LBJ freeway , all the way back to Dallas with
no problems. We actually tried to recreate the sway,
65 mph,,,70mph,, plenty fast and JUST FINE! phew! That was a relief!
Good thing Dad didn't experience THAT in HIS car!
:-) We found a gas station that had an air pump and ,fortunately, was
next to a vacant parking lot. At this point I hand bombed
the tires off the rims and put on the good tires we brought with us.
Also, we did an alignment as it was going to be towed a
considerable distance, I thought that the toe should be set to reduce
tire wear at least. uncertain if the toe would positively affect
the horrible negative camber or not, I used a scissors jack under the
center of the tie rods and bent them until the wheels pulled
together on the rear side,1/4" . New tires on, reverse toe in set, brake
light bar duct taped on the nose , tow car gassed up and
ready to high tail it home!  We got back to my Aunt's house, had a
shower, breakfast, and a short conversation with my Aunt
:-( (wished the stay had been longer) we loaded up and headed home! Well
the truth be told, things had changed over time and
Dad had lost his landmarks in some places, I was glad that I had the
directions from mapquest_dot_com, but in other places where
we seemed to be lost by the directions, Dad came to the rescue and got
us back on the right way home!  So , overall as a team
, we worked out very well. The cruise was set and home we went! The
border crossing went very well as I had the
paperwork. The guard was more suprized that we only had 1 bottle of duty
free! than she was interested in the Bus.
