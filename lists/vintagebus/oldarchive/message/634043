   <h1>67 Bus Update (4-1-00) No Joking! (LONG)</h1>
   <b>&quot;No Quarter&quot; &lt;silent_at_beatricene_dot_com&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2000-04-02 17:33:04+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>The 67 bus sits perched upon a couple jackstands and a hefty 4x4 beam in my
grandfather's garage.  Yeasterday from about 1:00 until 8:30, (skipping
supper!), my 2 friends Shawn and Ryan (both pre-driving age teenagers), went
to town with the wire wheels, drills, and putty knives.  They spent the
entire time underneath the front of the 67 getting all the road dirt,
crusties, surface rust, you name it cleaned out.  I really owe them a big
thanks!  Even though they were just filthy from head to toe by the end of
the day, they were still all smiles because they are looking forwards to our
road trip to Minnesota later this year.  I was amazed when I got down
underneath the bus at just how much of the floor they had covered.  I
treated them out for pizza last night and I couldn't believe my ears when
they both said, "Man, I can't wait to get started painting!"  We're going to
be using POR15 because the floor is in such good shape, I want to preserve
it.  Both of them talk about this as being good practice when they start
restoring cars.  However they view it, I'm lucky to have a couple of devoted
car nuts - even if they don't particularly care that much for VWs. :-)

So while my troops were doing the grunge work, I spent the entire time
removing the wheel cylinders from the backing plates and then cleaning up
the plates (talk about RUST!).  I used a 3M abrasive pad this time instead
of a wire wheel because the wire wheels tend to polish up what rust it can't
remove.  The disposable abrasive disc/pad removes rust (and metal if you're
not careful) by a course sanding action.  It takes more work to get all the
nooks and crannies but I actually had bare metal showing through in many
places and the only places that it didn't reach were the pits.  I took a
wire wheel to these areas and it seems to do a really good job getting any
loose material out so that I can start POR15ing them soon.  Currently they
are soaking in a small tub of gasoline to help finish getting off the brake
dust material.  So far, the wheel cylinders are all stamped VW.  The MC and
reservoir are labeld FAG.  Today, the drums will get the rust removal
treatment and then I'll take them down and have them turned before I POR15
them.

In order to reach more areas underneath the front of the bus, I had my
helpers take a break and remove the steering box assembly - something about
young kids and impact wrenches - I don't know what it is but I have a hunch
it's the power feeling you get when you handle a powerful firearm - you feel
good and invincible. :-)  They had to remove the steering wheel, turnsignal
switch, etc. - not much to it really.  We put the box in the vise and
starting wire wheeling it down and I noticed a little trickle of fluid out
the end of the shaft.  Is this normal?  The box itself is not supposed to be
upside down anyways so maybe this really isn't a big deal.  Anyway, sometime
before I paint it, I'm going to adjust it - I don't know how yet but the
Bentley covers I'm sure.

Letsee - my helpers also removed the MC and did a really good job of it.
While there were doing this, I was working on the front suspension.
Everything is disassembled down except the kingpins.  I believe it was
Ronnie that told me it's usually the linkpins that go bad and not the king
pins.  I took out the grease fittings (zerks as they are called) and one of
the holes had old hard packed grease in it.  I dug it out and cleaned the
zerk out and sprayed a lot of wd40 in the hole while working the king pin
assembly back and forth.  It finally started to free up.  I put in the zerk
and pumped a ton of grease which drove the rust laden WD40 out and the
little bit of old grease that was left.  After greasing up both sides really
well (pump the gun, turn the king pin back and forth, over and over again),
I have one king pin with no play and other other one just moves a smidgen.
Ronnie warned me about the poor quality of seals for the kingpins that are
currently available and I tell you what, for as old as these seals are, they
are in wonderful shape.  I did manage to scrape them a little bit as I was
wirewheeling the whole spindle assembly but now I have 2 spic and span
looking spindles/kingpins.

In the linkpin area, I wasn't so lucky.  The pins were nothing but rust and
destroyed bearings.  After rolling the greasy rusty bearings around in the
bottom of a solvent can, I ended up with a quite a few more parts than what
went in.  As the solvent cut off the grease, the pins fell out of 2 of them.
The other 2 bearings don't look too bad but it's obvious to me that the
grooves worn in the bushings in the kingpin assembly and into the linkpins,
means new linkpins and new bushings.

BTW:  All these little washers about the size of a 50 cent piece came off of
the linkpins.  I've cleaned them all up and wd40'd them to prevent rust
until I can get them reassembled.  I know now that these are for alignment
purposes and I'm wondering if I shouldn't have made a note of how many went
where?  Is there a default value that I can start with and hope that it will
be right or will I have to hit up a professional alignment shop?</pre>
