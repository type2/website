   <h1>Jerome- the journey- epic</h1>
   <b>Claralw_at_aol_dot_com</b><br/>
   <i>1998-09-18 17:05:09+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>I woke up Wed am before 8, GMT, and called the airline.   London was hot muggy
and I had had the crud for a week, though it was slowly letting go, I felt
there would be nothing like a good dose of the desert to do me right.   I
invegled info from the Virgin reps, and quickly packed my stuff, ran out the
door, up to the Angel, and took the tube to Heathrow- an hour plus on the
tube, and then walking for miles with my luggage.   Arrived at the Virgin
Atlantic counter at 10:15, three quarters of an hour before the plane was to
leave, and the day before my scheduled flight, I said politely but firmly to
the helpful lady who said the flight was overbooked and they were hoping
people would accept a voucher and a seat on the flight to LA in exchange for
changing frm this flight, that I would be a nuisance until they put me on a
flight and got me out of there.   Visited a couple windows, bouncing around as
they directed me onward, and ending up talking to a very overworked man who
gave me a standby ticket, and even waived the change fee.   I would not want
his job.   Many blessings on his head.   At shortly after 10 30, I was given
the green light to board to plane, which meant hiking another 5 miles with my
stuff (I had packed light, but still, I didn't check anything) going through 2
check points, leaving stuff at one, running back through the milling masses of
the great unwashed, getting it, waiting until they had time to search it, and
turning back to gate 15675374576A to find the plane, wait for a seat, and got
on board- oh sweet mother of god thank you.   fly virgin, they kept bringing
drinks gratis, and the food is good, arrived  at  sfo wed afternoon- oh no VWs
so

skip to Friday AM Santa Cruz CA when I wake up at 3:30am local time, which is
sleeping in to  11:30 am england time, and say lets go honey - the bus was
packed the night before, and we are  showered, fed and coffee in cups and on
the road before 5am.   Chris' green/white 65 NSR deluxe w/ z bed in back.  yes
it is lowered and has extra headlights.  Evidently it surprised people that I
was traveling in a bus like that, but hey, we agree to differ, he enjoys going
faster, and I like the abilities stock height gives me, and the original look.

However, a disaster had struck, and and important piece of the bus had been
brooken while I was across the water, this was a constant irriation and made a
lot more work, as he had become dependent on this much desired option.  Yes,
the CUPHOLDER on the drivers side was kaput.    Yes, handing  the cup over for
mountain driving and gear shifting.  oi vey.  where's the rollo'ducttape?

Leaving early got us out of Santa Cruz, south and across a long way before it
started getting warm.   still am in Bakersfield.  bus is happy, we are
listening to tunes and lave the safris cracked on the passenger side, held
open by a piece of 1" x 2".    Didn't see any buses, until afte rthe lava
flow, wher ethere were four splits by the side, the rear one with a wheel off.
That guy said he had it all  under control, but the forward bus guy was upset-
tranny stuck in gear.   He was changing the clutch cable, though it wasn't a
clutch problem (?)   They didn't want help, so we carried on.    It is about
2pm i think when we went down the hill to Needles, and the temp outside rose
as we descended, and in the motor too (oil sender guage).  Stopped for gas,
went to a grocery store to get more ice, and enjoy the air conditioning, and
look for a squirt misting bottle.   no squirter there, next door at the drug
store- found the squirt misty bottle.  Walking outside was like walking into a
palpable wallo'heat.  Whumpf.   It even sounded like that.  I am all messed up
in the head- it;s sunny and hot and dry, looks like afternoon, but my internal
clock says time to go to sleep, where did all this heat and dry come from?
Go to a pizza place and chill for a while, eat, I drink a beer,  we chat with
some local guy who's waiting for his wife.   

Leave Needles a bout 3 or 4 , i forget, and just go up to the KOA at Kingman.
Don't know much about it, except as we left Needles, noticed there was all
this way on the road, and off to the right were some serious heavy duty dark
dark dark clouds low down- yes folks- ain- it really brought the temp down.
Driving out of needles was pretty, and deserty.   Approached kingman - a
slight uphill grade and there are more rocky cool things, and a splitty on the
roof of a junkyard, and round this corner cut into the hillside that had
gorgeous stripes of colours-  very cool.  to the campsite, they said it had
just had a big thunderstorm with hail going sideways.  We ate and I passed out
just after dark.

Saturday am-   got up and enjoyed the facilities which were the reason for
paying for a KOA, got gassed up and cruised to Jerome- up aand down through
rolling hilly desert stuff, though starrted seeing trees and stuff at higher
elevations, got gas at the gas station at ash fork, where the cows were
wandering around, and they sold lots of route 66 stuff,  turned off the main
road towards prescott, then hung a left towards jerome.  Seeing as we didn't
know where exactly the Jamboree was, we drove hrough the Funky metropolis of
Jerome, which sticks to a steep hillside by force of habit it seems, then
turned around, and asked the guy with the video camera who pointed it at us as
we got into town, he said- go thattaway, and we did, bumping up a dirt road to
a gold mine, where there were buses and buses and buses, and the occasional
bug, ghia, or other vehicle.  The caravan had not yet arrived.  </pre>
