   <h1>59 kombi in TX found! (long)</h1>

   <br/>
   <pre>Well, that was quick!
Ruth A thought she might have seen it in E. Texas, but it turns out that
Rex Rogers up in San Angelo has it... funnily enough, I had checked out his
page before, but I guess he didn't have photos of the graffitti inside the
bus up yet, so I didn't catch it.

So the story:
   My former roomie knew I was always looking for busses, and being a
bartender, he  heard a lot of hard-luck stories involving people needing to
unload said objects - for quick $$ or due to an angry landlord. Usually,
these turned out to be late bays, often w/ no title and/or severe body
damage, so they ended up being stripped and crushed (sorry).  One day he
mentioned that a customer, Eric The Scooter Guy, had a bus and needed cash.
Not running, he was keeping the engine; had extra parts.
I went and checked it out: it was a 59 Kombi, in fair  shape, good glass,
wheelwells cut (DANG), no motor, no apron;  inside was a spare front beam
and a LOAD of spare redux gears, tie rods, etc. And some Vespa parts (more
in the line of Eric's work).  Eric claimed he had rebuilt the redux boxes
on the Kombi, and  also  the kingpins. He needed the motor to fix his
girlfriend's squareback, which sat between the bus & the street. He had
lost interest, the GF wanted the car running NOW and he needed the dough
for new heads.
   Eric wasn't really a VW guy; don't know why he bought this in the first
place - mebbee to butter up a VW gal? He got it off a woman named Sarah if
I recall correctly; claimed it was in a field in mud up to the floor,
somewhere east of town. Had been used as a shed, which will explain to Rex
why the cargo floor was bent down between all the frame members. Oddly
enough, rust was there, but not as bad as you would expect from being in
mud. They hitched a v8 truck to it and hauled it clear.
   It sat for a while. Now, to me, the best part of this bus was the paint
scheme. Someone had carefully applied a US flag paint scheme to the bus;
red and white stripes on the sides and roof, blue field w/ white stars from
doors forwards... hey man, they may've been hippies, but I guess they were
TEXAS hippies :).  All this hippie rot didn't seem to sit well w/ Eric and
his roommates, who were died-in-the-wool Oi boys (a form of punk rock that
entails Doc Martens, shaved heads, drinking lots of beer and a healthy dose
of nationalism for whatever country yer from - and, depending on how thick
your shaved skull was, a nice dash of racism)... so this tie-dye sh*t had
to GO!!  Inside, the rear bulkhead had been painted with sayings like: "war
is not healthy for children..." etcetc. The punkers took some black
spraypaint and scrawled 'CLASH 1977' over it all. When I saw that, I
laughed so hard I knew I was buying the bus!
   I don't know that I believe him about rebuilding anything; Eric has a
good rep w/ Vespas, but the VW stuff was scattered everywhere, seemed a
little sloppy to me. Regardless, I know that I spent a desperate hour
underneath her, holding the tranny up with my knees, a flashlight in my
mouth, trying to get some bolts in to the tranny mount so that the patient
towtruck man and I could roll her. Whether Eric rebuilt anything, he sure
as hell had the tranny out!
   She sat in my storage space for a while; I owned a record-pressing plant
at the time, and spent 40 hours a week (after my day job) making records
for customers - no time for fun stuff like rebuilding vws! Just for kicks,
however, I would go out and sit in her, looking around for hidden treasures
(just a pair of 6volt wiper motors, alas), imagining driving it, making
resto plans. She had a distinctive smell; maybe she still has it Rex?  I
liked how primitive she was.
   Sadly, the day came when an important part of my record plant broke down
- the plant was built 5 years before the bus! I was already late on a
customer's job, and a water pump rebuild was gonna set me back $400 I
didn't have. My friend Lewis (bus guru of many years) happened to have a
customer looking for an older bus. Chad came out and looked; I asked for
$450. He handed it over while I tried not to think about it... I only had
an hour to get to the motor shop, collect my pump and get back to work.
Watching the bus get hauled out was a double bummer because it went on a
flatbed - I really had wanted to drive it, just once. I had never
registered it, so simply handed him over the title. I kept the spare beam
and parts for my 65.
   I saw the bus a few times after that... once Chad came to my record
store to complain; seems the tranny had fallen out while driving down the
main drag!!  I reminded him that he KNEW the tranny was held up by two
bolts, ANY old bolts, from when I towed it; he had neglected to replace
them, and they broke under the strain. No harm done, and after replacing
them in a 7-11 parking lot, off he went (Rex, check those bolts!).  Chad
apparently grew bored with her, but not before letting her star in a Disney
movie, "Michael" .  Sadly, the movie folks gave her a MickeyMouse
HOUSEPAINT brush job, ruining her period-piece beauty (BTW, that makes TWO
of my busses in Disney movies!! The green 70 can be seen in "The Big
Green.").  I lost touch with Chad and the bus long before that, however.
   I always pined after the beast, and last Friday got a wild hair up my
butt and decided if ANYONE can find a bus in a haystack, these LIsts can.
Whaddya know, it worked!!!!
   I am delighted that she went to a good home, and was someone's 'first
bus.' Rex has indicated that visiting rights may be allowed in the future,
here or in San Angelo; so I'm gonna put the public pressure on now: can I
drive it once, Rex?? :)
