Beetles may have a good reputation, busses certainly don't.  At least not 
with the general population.  I personally know three people who have owned 
busses in the past and have had them breakdown because of overheating issues. 
Engine failure, whether you choose to call it catastrophic or not happens to 
busses frequently.  To know this all you have to do is monitor what's posted 
on this list.  Or talk to someone who works on them.  They suck valves, crack 
their heads, drop valve seats, push exhaust valve seats into the exhaust port 
and hole pistons.  Why do you think the # 3 exhaust valve has such a 
reputation?
Three weeks ago I was on my way home from the races and stopped for a 
stranded bus as I was climbing Altamont pass.  The kid, who had owned the bus 
for 3 months, had lost his # 3 exhaust valve into the cylinder.  He had been 
driving from Stockton (about 40 miles) doing 65 of 70, so when he got to the 
grade his engine was already too hot.  He just put it on the floor and made 
it about half way up before his engine gave up.  If he had a CHT gauge it 
wouldn't have happened.  I'll bet his head temp was close to, if not over, 
500 degrees.
Back in the mid 70's I used to buy nice clean busses, and beetles for that 
matter, that had bad engines and repair them and sell them.  They were easy 
to find and you could buy them for next to nothing.
How many times have you read on this list about someone finding a nice clean 
bus that needed engine work?

That's probably true.  It's also true that had they put them in it would have 
been an unnecessary embarrassment.

I agree they aren't essential.  If you do city driving with short freeway 
trips and you keep the maintenance up they are just added weight.  But if you 
climb any mountains or take trips at high speed for more than about 20 
minutes it's easy to exceed a low stress operating temperature.  
For instance, my brother lives about 40 miles from me and it's flat the whole 
way. If I have a tail wind and I drive 60 MPH my CHT will stay between 265 
and 280.  If I have a head wind my CHT will be more like 325 to 350.  If I 
have a strong headwind I have to slow down to 55 to keep the CHT from going 
above 350.
If you choose to monitor you CHT and keep it at, or below 350 degrees your 
engine will last longer.  Oil filters are not essential either, but they 
prolong the life of the engine.

I was about 900 miles into the break-in of a new engine and was on my way 
back from Modesto when I notice my oil temp was starting to climb and my oil 
pressure was gradually decreasing.  I pulled over to check the oil and found 
I was three quarts down (I have a sump and an aux. cooler so the capacity is 
6 Qt).  There was a pin hole in an oil hose.  Does that count?
I feel safer knowing what's going on.  I prefer to know, not guess.  It's 
just a matter of personal preference.  I also am successful at making engines 
last a long time.  So I think there is something to my OPINION.
