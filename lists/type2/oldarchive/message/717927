   <pre>EV Folks:

So Tracey didn't actually ASK for this (not yet at least), but Jack did, so
what the heck, it's friday (still) and I'm not sleepy yet.  Besides, even
you Vanagon owners will someday come across a *deal* on a used EV that you
won't be able to resist! 8')

My EV GL was one of the last new 93's on the lot when I bought it in Nov
94.  I've checked the door sticker, and it was built in 92.  So... doing
the math, it appears that a couple of time-critical items sat and rotted
those two years that I attribute MOST of the many problems to that I had
with the thing between January 95 and May 95.  Most of these were then
exacerbated (but not in public) by the nimrods at the dealer who seemed to
create two new problems with every one they fixed, or tried to fix.
Probably only one problem had anything to do with the manufacture of the
vehicle.  To wit:

First problem occurred at about 6K miles.  This was the only REAL problem.
I'm on my way to work and lightly decelerating while going over a long
overpass transiting (not "transitioning", as KFWB would have you belive)
from the 710 to the 10 west, I hear what sounds like a siren in the
distance.  Think nothing of it and casually accelerate onto the 10.  Next
time I decelerate I hear the siren again, only closer.  Shortly, I realize
it's coming from under the front of the vehicle and only happens while
decelerating in 5th gear.  Gets louder, pretty rapidly.  Fear sets in, but
I quickly learn that I can prevent the noise by pushing in the clucth while
decelerating rather than letting the transmission shoulder the load.  Okay,
I'm half way to work, and about half way between my dealer (McKenna in
Norwalk) and Trans Ocean in Pasadena.  So I drive it to Trans Ocean to have
them check it out.  Easily convinced that it needs to come apart.  They
give me my first of about 8 Enterprise rental cars and I'm off to work.
Saw the puppy apart.  Fifth gear is splined and bolted on the end of the
mainshaft with a big binder-head bolt.  Bolt had loosened and was rubbing
against the stamped metal end cover while the 5th gear had worked partway
off the shaft and was encountering another gear (don't remember which one,
reverse?) spinning the wrong way.  About a week later and I get it back.
Transmission sounds like hell to me, but they say bring it back in about a
week, they couldn't quite fill it with gear oil (!).  When they do, it
still sounds like hell.  Hard to describe, sort of a SHHH sound while
accelerating, louder when accelerating hard and when car is warm, mostly in
3-5 gears, and a broken gear-like sound at very low speeds, not under load
in 1st, 2nd and reverse.  It took about 4 trips to both Trans Ocean and
McKenna to get the mechanics to agree that something was wrong.  Mind you
VW enthusiasts out there, this would have been VERY EASY, in my opinion for
any one of you to hear and recognize as WRONG.  But VWs best couldn't the
first 3 times.  Turned out reverse gear was cracked!  I *begged* them NOT
to fix the thing, but to REPLACE it instead.  Wish they had.  SSHHH sound
is still there, but not quite as noticeable, and occaisionally (too
infrequently to rely on "showing" the mechanics, I'm afraid) I feel sort of
a vibramassage in the clutch pedal when the throwout bearing is just
contacting the pressure plate.

Second major problem also began on my way to work, but closer to McKenna
this time.  Engine started to miss, only a couple of times at first, then
really badly, such that I could only go about 30MPH by the time I limped in
to the dealer.  Backfiring, too (I was really worried about this and what
it might do to the cataclysmic perverter).  They gave me another rental and
sent me on my way.  Called me a few hours later, saying nothing was wrong.
I told them to leave it running for a half hour and call back.  Sure
enough, it started missing on them.  So, what did they do?  The couldn't
figure out what was wrong so just "reset the basic settings on the
computer" and gave it back to me.  I told them to make sure, cause I was
driving up to my sister's in Crescent City in two days with the fam, and
didn't want the problem to come back.  They said don't worry.  Right.  Sure
enough, on the way back, around Lost Hills it starts backfiring again,
finally quits for good.  Got a tow into Buttonwillow for the night.  Under
advice of mechanic at Family VW in Bakersfield, I try to limp it there the
next morning, cause it started fine (always did cold).  Got half way and it
croaks again.  VW 800 number lady was polite but essentially unwilling to
help get a towtruck.  I called Family back and yelled at them.  They sent a
truck out right away and pull me to Bakerspatch.  Got another rental, took
the fam home and waited...  I have had a couple of batteries do something
like that when an intermittent opening in the circuit developed somehow.
Told the bakerspatch mechanic about that, he said NAW, but two days later
they call and say, by crackie, you're right, it was the battery.  From
sitting two years on the lot, only being partially charged, I suspect.
Well, all that backfiring messed up the exhaust system somfin' fierce.
McKenna ended up replacing all but the header pipe (converter was
pulverized, mufflers were plugged), and VW said replace the computer and
fuel pump, just to be sure.  Having the mechanics in it so many times
(because they couldn't ever solve all the problems the first time, don't
you know) has made me a little nervous about its longevity.  But, it's
still got 20K to go before the powertrain warranty runs out, and it's been
running quite well the last 10K...

Already posted about the Continental tires.  Some of you guys like them.  I
hated mine, but again figure sitting on the lot for two years didn't do
them that much good.  Like I've said before, it's conceptually the best van
around.  The single best improvement they could make would be to reduce the
amount of road noise that gets into the interior.  Don't quite understand
why it's as bad as it is (though it isn't that bad, just that the rest of
the car's so quiet).  I worry a lot about the local salespeople's and
mechanic's attitude about the van.  Most don't think much of it.  Main
problem is they are mostly car-drivers (I don't feel like I can get my
money's worth in a car, been driving vans too long).  And since everybody
is so into these silly so-called "minivans" (I propose they be renamed
"pods"), they don't give a real van much credit.</pre>
