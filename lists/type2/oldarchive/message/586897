   <h1>50K or 150K mi? Checking milage on a purchase-</h1>
   <b>Mike Benthin &lt;benthin_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2003-08-27 08:15:14+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Often we are confronted with a potential purchase whose history cannot
be traced- and claimed milage is suspect- here is a compilation of
things to check, some of which are easier "on the spot" than others.
In this case, ~120 psi was claimed/found in a compression test.
If other listees have suggestions, let's add them.

When we got the 75 bus, the owner claimed their was only 62K on it, and
his title certified (by his sig)
that the milage shown was as shown and not reclocked.   I later found
out he had lost the title and got a duplicate, so there was nothing to
hint he had gotten it years earlier. - The only clues I went by at
purchase were the
pristine headliner and rear seats (he never used the back)- so the
sliding door track showed little wear.  The valve covers I
checked/removed, and
it looked very clean, with the adjustor nuts showing no wear (clean
corners)- turns out it was very tight and likely adjusted very little. 
The trans had a bad 2nd gear-(locked) a clue that bothered me!   and
what clinched
it is when I post purchase found a
sticker not in the door but on the back of the engine lid that showed an
oil change at 108,000! There are ways to get evidence re wear, I found
out 
(and I'll post it to the list)- such as:
-Gas pedal hinge- wiggle the pedal sideways- play shows 100K more pedal
pushes!
-Floor mat- if replaced, that is not a good sign- 152K should show more
heel wear, and it, like the pedal covers should not need replacement at
62K.
-look at the driver seat cover- is the piping intact or worn off and
hanging/gone?  Is it saggy on the left, and has it been recovered,
usually as  an aftermarket pullover.
-Look at the door striker plate-is there wear against the mating
surfaces?  How much play is there in the window crank arm after screw
tightness is verified?
-look at the battery connectors-how much wear is on the nuts to show
replacements over the years, vs it "just sitting there"?
-Wheels- wear on the front
rotor is a clue, as is bearing play when you wiggle the jacked up
tire-especially the rears.  At 62K drums should be a lot less worn than
162K- look at the adjusting stars through the adjusting holes- are they
clean or rounded from adjustment; are the hole edges smooth or bunged
from being pushed against by an adjusting tool against stiff stars?  Is
the parking brake loose or had to be adjusted?
Trans- how tight is the shifting? Is the shift lever "sloppy"? 
Obviously there is little clutch wear at 52K, and looking at the cable
adjustment may give a clue.  A worn disk requires loosening the cable
(backing off the nut) but cable stretch requires the opposite, and often
in worn clutches I see the adjustor is cranked in to compensate
stretch.  Wiggle the arm of the shift fork- is there bushing play? 
Check how much weeping is shown- the more usage (internal pressure) the
more you should see years of coating of dirt on the weeped oil. Any sign
of oil weeping from the rear seal?

-Engine-fair number of clues- but difficult if a rebuild was done-ie,
some clues may be absent-
Distributor- If stock,  check the shaft wear by wiggling it. If it was
replaced (009?) I'd be suspicious.
-Carb- worn bushings are a clue-is there play when you wiggle the
throttle arm and when you check the choke throttle plate under the air
cleaner?  Look at the steps on the fast idle cam- are they rounded? Look
at the cable tube in the fan housing- how worn is it where cable rubs
against same side?  Signs of a rebuild or replacement are not a good
sign.
-Alternator or generator- how worn is the commutator and brushes? Is
there play in the bearings that have been spinning the cooling fan?
-Checking under the valve covers gives a host of clues- how worn is the
surface the cover holders rub on?
As I recall on our 71, the warpy washers on the rocker arm will show
flattening of the curved contact edges with high milage- this can be
seen with a bright flashlight.
-At 150K, 100 valve adjustments should show much more wear than 36
adjustments!   The adjustor nuts should show wrench wear if loosened
many times.  Assuming you don't mind doing a valve adjustment, remove
the adjustor bolts and look at the end banging the valves- this was the
clincher for our 75, as the ends clearly show the flattening that will
happen at 152,000 mi vs little wear of 52K-also, as we discovered, years
of sitting can cause pitting on the ends of the adjustors that sat
against the valve.  the valve stem ends also look more "mushroomed" if
original 152,000 mi- but if a rebuild was done this may all not be
apparent-  looking at the heads may at least show if they match or are
VW or have rebuilder marks.
-if able do a wet test at compression checking- ie, did the compression
go up significantly when oil was squirted in, suggesting ring wear?  120
is good, but an engine with only 52K mi and well adjusted valves should
show 135-140.
-assuming the owner did the oil changes, did the oil turn black within
1500 mi
or so-   That implies a well used engine with some blowby.  A past
neglected engine can show this also if carbon built up. Check the
dipstick oil against
a white paper towel.
-is there an oil pressure gauge?  Running 0ver an hr on a hot day, is
the pressure 18 or 35 at over 3000 rpm?
With no gauge, is there any light flickering at low idle?
-I,m sure the list can add to this list!
