   <h1>EB 2005 Trip Report</h1>

   <br/>
   <pre>Well, I am finally getting around to the trip report :-)  

 

We decided well in advance that we wanted to take the Double Cab.  It's more
nostalgic and it was simply the thing to do.  Our plans to leave on 8th did
not last long.  Our original plan was to leave on the 8th so that we could
take our sweet time and not worry about rushing the truck.  Even though I am
not sure that it could be rushed if we tried.  Not knowing Type 1's that
well, we had the truck looked over mechanically and had several items taken
care of so that we could rest a little easier.  But, as we all know that
does not always tame the nature of the beast.  Our departure on 12th (yes 4
days later than planned) soon proved this.  Our initial drop into Kansas had
been going quite smoothly.  Although in the beginning I planned on taking
highways and staying off of the interstate, the truck was pulling strong at
55mph so it was comfortable enough for us to cruise the interstates.
Thankfully, this made the trip much more straight forward since we were
running day's behind. So, after being in Kansas for a good 50 miles, we
start getting this hesitation from the engine.  The hesitation was very
intermittent though.  When the hesitation did not occur, the engine ran
strong as if no issues.  My first thought's were some type of disruption in
the fuel flow to the carb.  So we stopped at a rest stop and took a look.
Everything seemed to be ok from a connection standpoint.  As mentioned by
other's I checked to make sure no fuel lines were running next to any items
that would heat the lines.  Also checked the timing a dwell which checked
out fine.  Made a call or two to FasterLaster and Joe (bustedbus) and
further confirmed the likelihood of a fuel supply issue.  After some more
staring, I realized there was no fuel filter.  At least, there was not one
in the engine bay.  I called the previous owner who had installed a 25
gallon marine gas tank.  He confirmed that there was one right before the
carb but that he had not installed one near the tank.  DOH!  Ok cool, we
have a couple with us so I slap one in and on we go.  There was absolutely
no pattern though to make out.  Sometimes it happened on a hill and
sometimes it didn't.  Sometimes I was floored, sometimes I wasn't.  We
decide to rest on it for the night and see what the morning bring.  

 

After spending the night in Colby and still having the same issue in the
morning, we realized that there was no way we were going to be able to
continue without figuring this out.  The filter had not become immediately
filthy so I did not suspect a bunch of crap in the tank.  I called Joe again
and asked if he could find a shop in the area that we were in to see if
someone could help us out.  Thanks for everyone's reply to the list by the
way.  Much appreciated.  We ended up stopping by a shop in Salina, Kansas.
I believe the shop's name was Woosters and a man by the name of "J" helped
me out.  Turns out that Friday was the last day the shop would be open as he
was retiring.  In any case, a quick investigation showed that no fuel was
running out of the line from the tank like it should be..courtesy of
gravity.  Our thoughts were that the aftermarket gas tank was probably not
as high up as it should be or the fuel line was not running the correct
path.  J offered a quick solution of a small EMPI fuel pump that would
provide about 6 psi of fuel to the carb.  We got this installed, and J also
adjusted the fuel mixture a bit since we had dropped quite a bit in
elevation.  Got it running much better but he said the carb should be looked
at further.  Seems that he was having to use the idle adjustment screw and
the cam on the carb to get it to idle right.  Mark Dearing also pointed out
while at the campout that I should check the idle jet as well.  I still have
not gotten around to that even though I wanted to before we left back home.
So we get back on the road and all seems well.  No more hesitation and
engine is running very nice.  We plow through Kansas and stop somewhere just
East of Kansas City.  My mind fails me at the moment.  Our plans then were
to try and hook up with FasterLaster by the end of the next day.  A long
haul but worth a shot.
