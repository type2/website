   <h1>trip report: Seattle to Canadian Rockies</h1>
   <b>rickgo_at_halcyon_dot_com (Rick Gordon)</b><br/>
   <i>1996-07-31 07:08:53+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>A somewhat longwinded account of the recent week-long I took the EV on.
Pictures will be posted to the Web page soon. VW content is sparse, but
present.

Technical Details:
Total miles: 1761
Total fuel: 87.6 gals (US)
Total fuel cost: US$143.76
Total breakdowns: 0
Oil consumed: 0
Miles per day: ranged from 95 to 230.
Average mpg: 21 (range was 16.5 to 25.3)
(Best mileage along Hwy 1 from Revelstoke to Golden - probably due to
nonstop freeway driving; worst was between Osoyoos and Nelson where there
was a lot of stop and go and big hills; in the Rockies themselves we did
about 19 mpg.)

The route: from Seattle we took SR2 over Steven's Pass, then north on SR97
to cross the border at Osooyoos, BC. From there, we took #3 to Castlegar,
then #22 to Nelson, then #6 to Kaslo. From there we turned west onto #31A
crossing the pass up near Sandon, then headed north again on #6 until
Nakusp. From there, northward on #23 until Galena Bay, where to took the
free ferry across to Shelter Bay and continued #23 north to Revelstoke.
=46rom there it was a straight shot out #1 to Lake Louise, where we took #93
(the Icefields Parkway) up to the Columbia Icefield. From there we turned
around and headed back south to Lake Louise, then south on #93/95 to
Cranbrook, then west on #3/95 to Yahk, then west on #3 to #6, where we
turned south and crossed the border back into Washington. From there, we
continued south on SR31 to SR20, then followed that all the way across the
state, taking the Keystone ferry to Port Townsend and heading home there
along 19, 3 and 305.

Where we camped:
Conconully Lake, Sugarloaf campground (WA) - mosquito ridden, have to
scrounge for wood, mainly a place for fishermen, free is main virtue.
Nancy Greene Provincial Park (BC) - by road, nice lake and trail though.
Convenient when everything else around Christina Lake was full. Lots of
squirrels.
Davis Creek Campground - north of Kaslo, nicest place we stayed, right on
lake. Hot in the daytime. Not much else there though.
Upper Arrow Lake area  - 23 km south of Revelstoke,mosquito ridden, not
much there.
Mosquito Creek Campground, Banff NP - not bad, nice creek
Wilcox Creek Campground, Jasper NP - nice, near trail and icefield.
McLeod Meadows Campground, Kootenay NP - hot, mosquito-ridden (worst yet),
nice creek, trail to Dog Lake which was too hot to go to.
Curlew Lake State Park (WA) - relatively crowded but enough space between
spots to make it reasonable. Lots of walkin sites too. Hot showers!

Some miscellaneous observations:
- Although I didn't see any oil consumption, I did see fluctuating coolant
levels, and I seem to have lost a slight amount. The level varied with
pressure (and I always checked it in the morning), but not in the way I
expected: it was lower at higher altitudes! It never got more than halfway
between max/min.
- I saw lots of Vanagons, quite a few EVs some of which were campers (even
a Rialta), and a few buses. I waved at everyone, but only 50-60% waved
back. Vanagon drivers were the worst. The bus drivers usually flashed me
the "peace sign". Most EV drivers waved heartily.
- Climbing those grades in the Rockies was a real test. Worst cases were on
th 8% grades where I would have to shift down the 3rd and plug along at
about 40 mph. That didn't last long though - I usually just popped it into
4th and pulled the hills at 50+. Considering the conditions, I think the
van did fine - I very rarely had anyone fuming behind me, and when I did it
was usually because *I* was behind someone that couldn't drive that fast.
- I don't think I saw a single policeman (or woman) the whole time I was in
Canada. I hadn't really noticed until I got back into the US and kept
seeing sheriff cars.
- I don't think Canadians have an accent, they just correctly pronounce the
"ou" sound in all the words that we either leave it silent in or take it
out entirely!
- In the inner Kootenay region, apart from Nelson, it was pretty much just
Canadians vacationing there. That whole area was pretty nice country,
relatively undeveloped, and relatively unpretentious in its pricing.
- Banff/Jasper National Parks are certainly beautiful places, but the
townsites are awfully crowded. Its kind of frenetic, and everything costs
extra $ of course.
- I collected lots of tourist info from the different areas, much of which
was pretty useless. A few good maps and campground listings though.
- Next time I'll bring an axe. The firewood provided in the Provincial
Parks is nice, but its unsplit cottonwood and needs to be split to get the
hotter fire it needs to really get going. My hatchet just wouldn't do it
sometimes.
- Also I'll bring an extra water can: the EV only holds 12 gals and some
campgrounds did not have potable water supplies. We never really ran out
but we had to hunt around a couple of times for someplace to refill.
- I saw lots of people with rental RVs up there. Don't know what they cost.
- Local (Okanagan) paper reporting on how local businesses are leaving an
Okanagan BC Internet service provider because he provides services for
white supremacy movements as well. (So I guess those people made it up into
BC as well.) (But see my comments on Twisp et al below: its not all bad out
here!)

And finally notes from the trip:
Crossed mtns via Highway 2, then north to Okanagan. EV made good time.
Upon leaving headed up through Oroville, take advantage of the cheap hot
showers at Osoyoos State Park just south of Canadian border. Noticed that
all the vehicles had BC plates.
At border crossing, the Sinead O'Conner lookalike customs agent decided she
wanted to search the van. This after a 20-minute wait. I think this was
because I said "I hope not" when she asked if I had any pets or animals
with me. (I was thinking about the mouse droppings we had found in the van
just before the previous trip.)
We tried to stay at Texas Creek but after this long meandering road we
found it to be quite full. (They could of posted a sign!)
Next stop was some dirt road just east of Paulson Pass. But then we saw
something that looked enough like it could have been bear scat that we
decided to push on, and ended up at Nancy Greene. In hindsight, we were
probably too paranoid.
Interesting thing - while we were checking out the woods, some Mercedes
camper van decided to camp just down the road.
On the 2-meter, via the Nelson repeater I spoke with the first of many
German tourists, this one some fellow named Wolfgang who flew into
Vancouver, rented a car there and was driving it to Calgary. Also spoke
with a local fellow (VE7HEG I think). I was pretty far away but at 4000 ft
elevation had a good line of sight to the repeater.</pre>
