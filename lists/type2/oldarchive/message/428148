   <pre>Whew!
What a campout! Just got home after that grueling 30 mile drive, with an
obligatory stop at the Mellow Mushroom in Blowing Rock.  Crazy Auntie
Sherry and I arrived Wednesday night with the Tinkertoy and the Fordbus
Single Cab fulla wood for the campfire. Greetings to Buddah and the
other 8 buses that got there ahead of us, off to town with Buddah for
dinner, setup what we brought and off to bed, me having been up some 30
hours by that time. Thursday back down the hill to drop off the Fordbus
Single Cab and resurrect the Award Winning Burrito Express (AWBE
henceforth) for the trip back up the hill.  Returned to the campsite
about 2 P.M. Setup Crazy Auntie Sherry's sewing and crafts pavilion then
settle in for a nice relaxing campout.  Had DocRic, Teddy, Brad, and
Dawn down for Pasta Fazool dinner, an easy camping dinner, recipe at the
end of this missive.

Rain came, rain went, was gone more than there so it was good all
weekend long!  Greet people who came and went, I did something different
this time, I hung with my lovely bride throughout the campout.  We
usually show up and go in different directions, waving at each other in
the distance (and usually using all our fingers) when we saw each
other.  It was much fun, and we enjoyed having each other for company
without the younun's along,they having opted to stay home and not do
what they were told to do (like watch critters and such).

Friday morning, breakfast and coffee, then drop the engine in the AWBE
for an alternator change.  The extant alternator had wallowed out the
keyway, making pulley alignments a rather interesting exercise in
futility, as well as cutting 2/3 of the way through the the face of the
alternator. Dave came and hung out and as usually happens with
conversant onlookers, ended up helping with the reinstall, and many many
thanks for your help!  Of course after any major surgery, a road test is
in order so I loaded up the Tennessee Mechanized and we went off to play
with go-carts and stop by Wal Mart.  It was raining so I parked way away
from the entrance to Wal Mart because everyone else was parking lot
cruising and I knew there wasn't a close in spot worth fighting over. 
Shopping done we went off to the kart track who were very unwilling to
let us drive the karts on a wet track, despite our most sincere promises
to use the tires of the karts to dry the track for them so they could
get back to business as usual.  We would even have been willing to break
traction in the corners to speed the process.  Back to the campout with
tears in our eyes (or was that the continuing rain?)

After another great dinner and some socializing, off to bed to listen to
the drunk people talking way too loud until 3+ A.M.  Had a strange lucid
vampire dream going on - very strange.

Saturday morning up early to cook breakfast burritos for the hungry
masses.  As usual, none of us FMBC breakfast Burrito veterans had to say
anything, cooking got underway with it's usual smoothness.  Watching the
people line up the hill with saliva drooling as they smelled the
scrumptious repast we had prepared was thanks enough.  A few folks got
grumpy when we ran out of bacon but they didn't go get any so we
couldn't cook it for them.  Next time bring some and join us cooks who
work very hard with little thanks.  After breakfast was served, the
cleanup crew kicked in and did their phenomenal job of clearing the mess
and restoring order to the world.  Heidi and Alex arrived with some
friends to spend time with their parents.  The rest of Saturday was
socialize, go off to the kart track to chase each other around for a
while, back to the campout, where my knight another knight and I
proceeded to try to hit each other with sticks.  Several little ones got
to play 'Whack a knight', and were knighted by a real Duke!  After we
fought for an hour or so we stopped, replenished our fluid levels, and
the good Knights departed for their respective homes.  I showered, ate
dinner then it was time to get ready for VW Family Feud.  Blistered
Dawson tottered in just in time to put on a memorable show, the panel of
celebrity judges seemed to enjoy the show although his highness
Achachachaachach AchAch was restrained to ensure his safety (and those
of the audience in reach of his fearsome scimitar).  The rest of the
night was listening to Bessie May's dream (who ended their show with
some great renditions of Wish you were here and Shine on you Crazy
Diamond).

Circulate around, get a phone call from Chris Slaymaker on the
cool-phone.  I don't usually get calls from Chris.  As a matter of fact
this was the first one I ever got.  He was in Lost Wages, losing money
but asked me to "say Hi to everyone".  So Heidi and I did, walking
around from campsite to campsite telling all I encountered that Chris
said Hi. I got a whole bunch of people at the case fire and got the band
to announce it so yes, Chris, I kept my word like I said I would. 
Wander more, get Baaa Braa written on by the airbrush guy for Rob 'Hot
Dog' Henley.  Wander, socialize, and finally off to bed about 2 A.M.</pre>
