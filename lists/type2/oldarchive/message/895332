   <br/>
   <pre>Hey just had an interesting and successful journey.

Before I left I changed the oil (at 1700 miles, early, but why not) and 
checked the valves (no adjustment needed)

Left Oly, WA Thursday about 3pm... though I meant to leave earlier in the am 
actually, but packing etc. does take time for some reason.  Got gas in 
Chehalis (30mpg!!! must be a fluke) and stopped at a rest area to check the engine 
just in case... looked like a hundred motorcycles... must be some organised ride 
going on.  The time meant I hit rush hour traffic in Portland.  Listening to 
the radio I heard of a stalled semi on I-5 in Portland, so decided to take the 
loop around (I-505) instead of the shorter way through the city.  Radio also 
soon mentioned a car fire, then a crash, and a log truck having dropped some 
logs south of the city.  Luckily I was only delayed half an hour by slow 
traffic, but it was hot and boring.  Cruised about 60mph , with oil temps about 
190F, nice warm day with safari cracked open.   Getting dusk as I hit Eugene, and 
headed east on 58.   The engine sounded sweet going through the windy forested 
mountain road.   I stopped at a campground soon after full dark, cooked up 
some supper and hot chocolate, and passed a cosy night.  Only one other vehicle 
was there.

Woke up at a chilly dawn And made coffee.  Wandered around a bit looking at 
trees and river.  Started up the bus, and headed out.  Stopped at the ranger 
station to check out local maps.  I decided not to head across the mountains to 
138, but to go east over the mountains, then cut back from the other side.   
Lots of snow up there, so the forest roads would not be terribly clear.  The 
pass was a bit over 5,000 ft, and the road was clear, the day was sunny, lots of 
dirty snow on the sides of the road.  Headed south at 97, then back west on 
138, back over the mountains (5,900 ft pass this time, a bit chilly) and 
stopped for gas at diamond lake, which was pricey, but I didn't need much (had 
filled up outside of (Eugene)   The lake was covered with ice, gorgeous actually.   
It was thawing, but I saw tires tracks where someone had driven out onto the 
lake (and back).   Loads of mountain scenery.    Back in the bus, and SW down 
the mountain about elev. 2500 ft to Umpqua hot springs.   A vanagon Westy was 
the only other car parked at the trailhead, and when I had hiked up the steep 
slop to the spring, the hippy couple there was leaving, so I had it all to 
myself.   nice sunny warm day...tall trees, hot mineral springs, and an ice cold 
river to jump in (okay I had to climb down a steep slope to the river, which 
practically froze my toes off, but wow... that woke me up!!!!)   No complaints 
at all.   eventually I decided I was melted into enough of a rubbery blob that 
I oughta leave, and hiked back down to the bus and ate lunch and chocolate.

Back down the dusty gravel potholed road to the hwy, then I headed E to 97, 
back over the pass.   I wanted to cruise around Crater Lake, but that road was 
closed, with several feet of snow on it.   I contemplated driving that way 
anyway, but decided not to.   So I got back in the bus, and it really smelled of 
gas.   Eventually decided that it must have expanded out the top of the tank, 
found no leak anywhere.  So back to 97 and headed south.   Stopped at the 
ranger station N of Klamath Falls to find out about campground, but they had just 
closed, so I stated looking at the brochures outside the door.  A guy coming 
out said they were kicking people out.   Turned out he and his girlfriend were 
the other car at the campsite I'd stayed at the night before... anyhow we all 
decided to camp at a site a few miles away, though they headed to town to the 
liquor store first.   The campsite ended up being a bit farther off the main 
road than I was led to expect, down a washboard bumpy road, but it was a nice 
place.  One with no electricity , and a hand water pump.  It was only late 
afternoon. Set up camp (awning, campstove, chair) and wandered down to the river.  
Yup, river's wet, has rocks in.  Wandered back and drank more water (hot 
springs make me thirsty) and cooked up some fried spuds/onions/garlic, and some 
soup.   mmm... hot chocolate.  Damn mosquitoes came out, and I swatted and read 
a book and enjoyed the scenery.  That couple showed up, and started a 
campfire, and we sat and bsed and drank their wine.  She kept adding sticks to the 
fire.  Turned out he had worked for Riviera Motors in Portland in the 70s, told 
me some VW stories.  They had a nice old dog.   Eventually I got tired and fell 
into the bus into a peaceful oblivion.

I woke up as the sky was getting light, and did the coffee routine, hotted up 
he un-et spuds from the night before for brekker.   Packed up the bus, filled 
up the water containers (squeak squeak goes the hand pump) and headed out.    
Filled up in Klamath Falls for 1.99/gal (over 25mpg).   At this point it was 
still chilly but the sun was up.   Soon was in California and the first gas 
station I saw said 2.69/ gal.  ACK!!!!!   Gorgeous views of Mt Shasta.   ( I'll 
put up pics soon)  When I got to Weed the gas was 2.23/gal.  Hopped onto I-5, 
having enjoyed the route that avoided the S Oregon range of hills to climb you 
get at I-5 between weed and Eugene.  Proceed to go downhill, and as the 
elevation dropped it started warming up.  I stopped at a rest area N of Shasta Lake 
to turn the heat off (which involved crawling under the bus for the rear 
heat)  and even with windows and safari open it was about 80F, about 10 am.   I 
peeled layers and applied sunscreen.  Redding was quite warm, but I waited till 
Red Bluff to get lunch and gas.    When I headed into the Bay Area there was a 
traffic jam of people leaving.   Oil temps around 200-205, I'm cruising 60 in 
the slow lane.    Got to my Bay Area destination about 5pm Saturday.   Now 
I'm about 240 miles since Red Bluff and haven't hit reserve yet, which is better 
than I expected.</pre>
