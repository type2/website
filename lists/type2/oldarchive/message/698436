   <h1>vanagons (all): recall info from NHTSA as of 05/06/94</h1>
   <b>Joel Walker &lt;JWALKER_at_ua1vm.ua_dot_edu&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1994-05-15 06:29:03+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>well, i called the 800 number and asked the machine for ALL vanagons from
1980 to 1991 ... and they sent it! :) so, here's what i got from them.
********
everybody with 1985-1991 vanagons: pay particular attention to Campaign SF
about the fuel line clamp in the engine compartment.  i did NOT get any
notice of this yet (but since i've already replaced all my fuel hoses AND
clamps, i HOPE it won't affect me).

and speaking of notices, if anybody else has any copies of the recall notices
that they've received, i'd appreciate getting a copy of it. thanks.

     Information as of 06 May 1994
-----------------------------------------
1980 Vanagon                Built from 1979 Jul  to  1979 Dec
     Campaign 79V270000     No. Recalled: 2,572
     Campaign EN            Notification Date:     800128
     System:                Suspension; Front Ball Joint Bolts
     Description of Defect: The bolts which attach each left and right
                            side front ball joint to the upper wishbone,
                            may not have been sufficiently tightened
                            during assembly. This could cause the ball
                            joint to separate from the wishbone.
     Consequence of Defect: Separation of the ball joint from the
                            wishbone could cause loss of vehicle control
                            and a vehicle accident.
     Corrective Action:     The dealer will tighten the ball joints to
                            the correct specifications at no cost to
                            owner.
-----------------------------------------
1980 Vanagon                Built from 1979 Jul  to  1980 Feb
     Campaign 80V800000     No. Recalled: 2,287
     Campaign ES            Notification Date:     800729
     System:                Heating; Heater Exhaust Pipe
     Vehicle Description:   Vans equipped with auxiliary heaters
     Description of Defect: The auxiliary heater's exhaust pipe is
                            mounted in a downward position toward the
                            ground.
     Consequence of Defect: In the event the vehicle is parked in an
                            area with dry material (grass) beneath it,
                            the downflow of exhaust could reach the
                            material and possibly ignite it.  A vehicle
                            fire and personal injury could result.
     Corrective Action:     Dealer will remove the existing pipe and
                            install a modified pipe with a shield over
                            the end, without charge to owner.
-----------------------------------------
1980 Vanagon and
1981 Vanagon                Built from 1980 Apr  to  1981 Apr
     Campaign 81V076000     No. Recalled: 92
     Campaign               Notification Date:     810422
     System:                Pop Top
     Vehicle Description:   Campers (Van Conversion)
     Description of Defect: During vehicle operation, the pop top
                            could loosen from its anchor due to wind
                            pressure.  It could open and separate
                            entirely from the vehicle.
     Consequence of Defect: Sudden opening of the pop top could be a
                            hazard to safe vehicle operation.  Complete
                            separation could cause an accident and
                            personal injury to other drivers.
                            NOTE: Until the problem is corrected, owner
                            is advised to avoid excessive wind pressure
                            against the pop top by driving at moderate
                            speeds.
     Corrective Action:     Dealer will inspect and, if necessary,
                            modify anchorages to make sure pop top will
                            be secured under normal operating conditions.

     Consequence of Defect: Door could open unexpectedly while the
                            vehicle is in motion; Occupants could be
                            ejected from vehicle and suffer serious
                            injury.

     Campaign 85V152000     No. Recalled: 16,328
     Campaign               Notification Date:
     System:                Door Look.
     Vehicle Description:   Van-type Wagon and Campers.
     Description of Defect: The latch of the passenger sliding door may
                            become damaged if excessive force is used
                            to close the door.  The damaged door lock
                            mechanism will not properly engage and the
                            door could open if vehicle is driven over
                            bumpy roads.
     Consequence of Defect: If this occurs there is a possibility that
                            a passenger could fall out causing injury
                            or death.
     Corrective Action:     Modify the sliding door lock assembly so
                            door will properly engage.
-----------------------------------------
1985 Vanagon through
1991 Vanagon                Built from 1985 Jul  to  1992 Jun
     Campaign 92V058001     No. Recalled: 340,000
     Campaign SF            Notification Date:
     System:                Fuel Lines.
     Vehicle Description:   Passenger Cars.
     Description of Defect: The fuel hose attached to the fuel
                            distribution rail on the engine may shrink
                            beyond the clamp force of the fuel hose
                            clamps, allowing fuel to leak.
     Consequence of Defect: Fuel leakage in the engine compartment can
                            cause an underhood fire if the fuel comes
                            in contact with a source of ignition.
     Corrective Action:     Replace the fuel hose attached to the fuel
                            rail and install a new spring type self-
                            tightening clamp.
                            NOTE: Volkswagen of America estimates the
                            new self-tightening fuel hose clamps will be
                            available in May of 1992.

                            compartment, can crack and eventually break.
     Consequence of Defect: If the plastic breaks where it is held at
                            the two mounting screws, the center air flow
                            duct can separate from its supports and
                            cause injury to the passengers sitting in
                            the center seat of the vehicle.
     Corrective Action:     Dealers will install a reinforcement plate
                            at the connections of both the center and

                            seam of the plastic casing.
     Consequence of Defect: Should seepage occur, leaking fuel can cause
                            a risk of fire in the presence of an
                            ignition source.
