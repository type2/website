   <h1>Agent 009....</h1>
   <b>NotaJeep_at_aol_dot_com</b><br/>
   <i>1999-03-12 00:18:00+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>As we all seem to be both shaken *and* stirred about the poor 009...
I'll jump in to muddle it *all* up..
VW engineers operate(ed) under the same parameter as do their counterparts
everywhere..make a perfect product that cost nothing to make and sells for all
the money in the world and is propraitary to your company with 15 patents...
Or build and ship anything so your "end of the month" (1/4..year) looks
good....
let's look at the distributor..
The V-dub has had many different types of distributors and caburators...
with a given carb/manifold/valve size/cam and CR the engine will need a spark
right *now* ,at any temperature, air pressure, load and fuel type.......
OKFINE.....
if your engine ran at one speed, temperature and load it would only need a
fixed spark timing..a typical Briggs and Stratton has just such a set up...
But, although on long hills it *seems* that you only have one spped, the
engine has to perform under many different types of conditions...hence the
advance "curve"...
We all understand that the spark has to happen sooner at high speeds to allow
the mixture time to burn and reach the peak pressure *just* when we need
it....
modern engines do this electronicly with computer "maps" and knock sensors..
at any given set of conditons the computer signals the coils(s) to fire the
plug at the time it thinks it needs to..the knock sensor is a feed back device
to let the computer know that it got a *wee* bit carried away on the
advance..it will drop back just a *smidge* and run the engine right at the
edge of detonation...neat...
the older cars had to do this mechanically....so right off the bat, the system
has a lot of built in margin...ain't no feed back on a 57 bug....(until you
blow a hole in a piston.).
Total mchanical advance....what this is the basic timing setting for the
engine at any RPM at wide open throttle under the "worst case" conditons of
pressure and temperature...(maybe minus a bit for safety)..it's all the engine
will take at that rpm...
"Put a 009 in my bug..get more power..'cause it's just like the Porsche
distriburor...."
Umm..no...
The Porsche didn't bother with a vacuum advance..the idea was that you would
*always* be a wide open throttle....if not, why did you buy ths car??? so the
vacuum advance would never come in to play anyway..ditto for the early
transporter..look at a early splitty..the gas pedal is bent to match the
contour of the floor where some cat spent all his time trying to push it into
the pavement......
So..for some engines, VW (Bosch) made mechanical advance distributors..
Ok for fullpower settings, but at lower throttle settings, engines can use
some more advance...the flame front moves slower as the mixture in the
cylinder gets less dense..so we can get started earlier and catch the peak
pressure just where we want it, even a low out puts...this helps the engine
temperature as the mixtrue is not burning late, helps the power as the peak
pressure is at the right place in the stroke, and helps the fuel economy as
the fuel is being used effectively....OK?
The full vacuum advance VW distributors are nothing of the sort....ir you put
one on a distributor machine and run it up without the vacuum hooked up, it
*still* advances!
Huh???...it has a crude mechanical advance..the friction of the rubbing block
on the cam drags the breaker plate around and changes the positon of the
points...
Ok, you, the wiseguy in the back row...
'Ah, yeah man..but if it pulls the points around with the cam, dosen't that
*retard* the time..?".
remind me to give you an A on the next test..
Yes, that is true.....*BUT*..the point swing is not concentric with the
cam..and the change in dwell advances the time more than it gets retarded!
clever, no? Ford did this for *years* with a vengence..look at a mid-sixties
ford with the pivot point out near the edge of the cap!
The vacuum added advance at anything less than about WOT...there is a built in
lag in the vaccum advance that allowed you to change throttle settings quickly
and snap back to where you were and the advance would not have a chance to
change (much) this makes the engine seem "smoother"...you are unable to
"suprize" the things with quick throttle motions...This is what JM was saying
about keeping your foot on the gas with "elan"...
these "vacuum" distributors worked well...the limited rpm range and the
typical bug driving conditons, all was well...not *great*..but hey, it was
cheap and it ran well..
As the car got heavier and speeds went up they needed more power *and* economy
form the flat 4..they finally gave in and put a mechanical advance with a
vacuum advance to get the best of both worlds....a combo unit acts like a full
mechanical under full power (because it *is* a full mechanical) and adds more
advance under low throttle settings when the engine needs and wants
it...great....the best (mechanical) system...
then steps in the smog regulators...Oh boy...what is good for the engine, fuel
economy and power is *not* always good for the air...
more power, better economy and smog *too*!?!? argggggH!
VW went to the duel port 1600...power went up to 60 hp! the bigger manifold
has a larger internal volume...due to all kinds of strange atmospherics in the
manifold, the pulse through the carb is"softened" with this "big"
manifold.....years before this simply ment bigger main jets or smaller air
correction jets..but the emisson/economy gremlins were out in force...and,face
it, the upright has a *weird* manifold.setup...
ok fine..they brought everything right to the edge...jetting, timing, cam and
valve timing...and when everything is spot on..the car ran pretty well...let
one thing get "loose" and God couldn't get it to run right
*Blame* the carb, *blame* the distributor....
Ok fans._dot_carb *perfectly* clean, good throttle shaft bushings..centered and
un-worn throttle plate..float height?..fuel pressure??
hmmmm
Pre-heated air hooked up?..adjusted correctly?
valves set? (cam bearings worn out?)
distributor set up *exactly* to spec on a distributor machine??? (the specs
are in the book)
manifold boots in good nick?
proper (metal) gaskets under the intake castings at the head?
engine thermostat set correctly? (or did the PO bin it?)
Correct plugs with the correct wires and ends?
Hmmm
*When* you have checked/adjusted all of this and the car *still* dosen't run
correctly, you have a beef....until then............
Fussing with different distributors or screwing with the carb is a waste of
time..
Do what you want/can with what you have.....
chances are your *best* bet for the 1600 dual port is a vaccum/mechancal
unit..
Oh yeah..the dual diaphram distributor?._dot_used manifold vacuum to retard the
spark so much that the chambers ran hot enough to burn all the fuel (rich
mixture needed at an idle) as soon as you crack the throttle it's back to the
base setting like a single diaphram unit......
the 72 bus (1700) used a vacuum advance cut-off..no vacuum advance until you
hit high gear .it's the little gismo next to the heater fan and the "extra"
back-up light switch on the tranny....
and now you know.........
