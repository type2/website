   <h1>Mexican Longblock Update</h1>

   <br/>
   <pre>Volks:

Thought I'd let you know how things are going with the
Mexican longblock I ordered from Beetlemex.  So far,
everything's gone exactly as promised with a few exceptions:
1. The engine was lost by UPS.  How can you lose an
engine?  It turns out the bar code got smeared with
grease, and so it kept on being shipped along, but not
tracked.  UPS is fairly awful to deal with, and they
were telling me things that were blatantly false. They
did not know where the engine was, and no one ever said
that.  After 7 phone calls I finally got someone who
was interested in customer service instead of quoting
policy to me.  I guess having worked for FedEx some
years ago, having gone through the training and heard
the stories of deliveries made by helicopter in floods,
I wonder why something close to personal interest is
not shown by UPS- they were telling me it would be 3
more days AS the engine was being delivered to Brooks's
house in Indianapolis. 
2. The engine was not packed well: it is my impression
that Miguel has not shipped many engines, and so there
was a not inconsiderable amount of damage to a few
things: the exhaust bolts were bent, the filter/pump
house was bent cracked, a valve cover was smashed (the
bail lost); worst of all, the oil cooler fins were
bent, which is just not something I can work around. 
He says the next one he ships will have a lot of
styrofoam; that probably would have saved this.  To his
credit, he is overnighting the damaged items to me, and
he called me literally from the recovery room after eye
surgery to tell me this.  I have found him to very
responsive, honest, and geninely concerned about
customers.  After I had already wired the money to him
for shipping, he found a cheaper way to ship, and sent
me a check for the difference even though he was under
no obligation to do so.
3. The engine itself is amazing: I suppose after
spending a few weeks schlepping through crappy
blownup/burned engines anything that was clean would be
great, but this thing is a work of art.  Some
improvements over the original: much more venting
around the ports, much heavier duty adjustment
screws/rocker arms, threaded holes to screw the
engine/tranny bolts into on the top of the engine (no
more trying to find a way of holding the nuts).  The
compression is so tight in this engine that air POPPED
out of the sparkplug holes as we turned it over to
adjust the hydraulic valves.  It has VW part numbers
painted on the block and the heads- very cool.  It
feels and looks more solid than anything from the early
70's, and of course there's the hydraulic valves
themselves.  The left head has extra metal on it, and
there's a sensor almost next to the #4 sparkplug hole,
which (after unscrewing it) must be a temperature
sensor.  I'm going to try to get the gauge that goes
with it: having an accurate head temp. would beat the
snot out of any other solution I've seen posted.  The
tin from my '71 all fits perfectly, every screw hole,
although we had to cut a hole in the tin to accomodate
the previously mentioned sensor.
4. Two hole are drilled on either side of the engine
for the mustache bar, but they are not tapped.  Tapping
them is not big deal because they're blind holes so no
shavings are in danger of falling into the engine. 
However, the third hole (middle) of the mustache bar is
not drilled (although the metal is there for doing
that).  We're probably not going to bother with it, but
it wouldn't be that difficult to do.

So that's about it; the oil cooler will be here Tuesday
(I hope), and we'll probably stick the engine in my bus
on Wednesday.  That is, unless Ted's hidden it
somewhere.  He likes my bus.  Hmm....

Anyway, I'd be glad to answer any questions via p-mail.
Although it hasn't gone perfectly so far, having a
brand new engine and tranny will make it all worthwhile
on the drive home, I can hardly wait.
