   <pre>
 It was a great weekend.  Sent out and e-mail on the vanagon list on   
Thursday afternoon seeing if anyone was going my way to the event   
(Greensboro NC to Asheville).  Friday morning I got a e-mail from a guy   
from the Chapel Hill area named Stefan (originally from Germany). Called   
him up and decided to meet around 2Pm in Greensboro. We were both egar   
 to go the show.  He has a White 76 weekender and I have a White 74   
Westie (Moby).  We both got groceries together and started toward the   
blue ridge mountains.  I highly recommend getting a CB for just such   
events because we both had them and it made the trip fun.  We arrived   
around after 6Pm at the site and met up with Richard Palmer and his   
friends, Stefan had met him before.  Also met up with Neil and his wife   
who were the people responsible for the event( Good job Neil) Got a space   
to camp and set up camp.  We all camped in the tents only space so even   
if you were going to sleep in your bus you had to put up some kind of a   
tarp or a tent.  With the help of Richard and Stefan and some new friends   
we set up my big bus tent on the camping site.  Stefan made some great   
food and  we made enough to feed several people.  After dinner we walked   
around talking to everyone with busses, it took 5 hours to walk 300 yards   
with everyone sharing stories and advice about there beloved Buses.   
 There were all sorts of buses in various stages of restoration.  Also   
stumbled into a group with a bunch of split window buses that were firing   
off a potato gun and having a TAG TEAM WRESTLING MATCH for VW parts!  The   
shirt team one that round.   
 Saturday morning everyone awoke to a chilly lower 40's and gathered   
together about 31 busses to go on a drive.  It was a really exciting   
moment driving on the Blue Ridge Parkway with so many Busses.  I loved   
the expressions of the people  driving past us as our convoy drove buy,   
sort of looked like a invasion of hippies .   We pulled over and took   
some pictures.  I hope someone out there can put some pictures out on the   
net some time.   We broke up the convoy with some going to a waterfall   
overlook and some to a Wildlife Fish Hatchery.   
 At the fish hatchery about 6 of us decided to take a dirt road back to   
the parkway.  We had the 1990 syncro leading the way with my 74 westie in   
the rear.  Half way up we encountered another camper coming down the   
trail,  he did not know there was the bus event that weekend and started   
to follow us.    We were traveling up the trail when I heard over the CB   
my friend Stefan trying to radio me.  He was with the other group   
parallel to us on the main road.  They asked us where we were.  The guy   
in the Syncro figured out that we were about 10 minuets behind them.   
 They said they would wait for us back on the parkway.  CB's are so much   
fun in a crowd!  Shure enough we met up with the other group on the   
parkway and headed back to camp.
That night we had a bon fire and Neil gave out awards for various things.   
 A 1962 camper won best of show,  and a guy from Alberquque won for   
longest distance.  He drove a 1960 high top delivery bus imported from   
Europe.  We talked, drank and ate hot dogs the rest of the night.
Next morning Everyone broke camp and headed to a spot on the parkway for   
the group picture.  They divided the buses up into two groups with the   
first group being the split window busses and the other group being   
everything else.  In total there were about 49 to fifty buses lined up.   
 It was wonderful.  Everyone took pictures and exchange phone numbers and   
E - mail addresses.   On the way home we had a convoy of four busses, one   
white 70 weekender a white 71crewcab, my white 74 westfalla and Stefans   
white 76 weekender.  Kind of funny to see 4 white bubble window busses   
going down the road.
All in all it was a great weekend, I even met a lady and her young son at   
the event, she drove the 70 weekender named Sunshine. We had our first   
date this last weekend and it went great!  Now we are going camping out   
at Cape Hatteras next weekend and the only problem is which bus to   
take? Later    Erick  </pre>
