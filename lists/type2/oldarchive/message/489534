   <h1>Re:heater box recirculation</h1>
   <b>&quot;John Anderson&quot; &lt;janderson_at_iolinc_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1998-10-08 16:04:42+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>With all this talk I'm going to launch into the fray.  If one were to look
back many years when we were all a happy family of about 150 back on
vanagon_at_lenti I believe I was the first to carry out and propose this idea
to the list (I'm surely not the first to do it.)  At the time I had a nice
'76 bus and those recirculation kits for the bugs were just coming into
being and I said, hey why not, we have the perfect system built in (to late
bays.)  Anyway for a post '74? or whatever bay that has the factory electric
fan feeding the system, your recirculation system is about 90% complete
already.

  First things first, the stock system must be made to be 100% airtight and
restored to "new" condition.  Now the buses featuring steel main pipes
likely won't at this point, but even those with the double layer foil paper
pipes are likely to have the Y at the rear and more importantly the
distribution box under the midsection rusted out.  Your choices here are
ones of ingenuity, the Y is tack welded to the crossmember on each side and
riveted under the rear seat in 2 locations, the distributtion box is tacked
to the crossmember on each side.  There are plenty of southern buses who
still have these in good shape (pained me to leave one on Steve D's old
Florida bus a few years back when it went to the crusher, but no grinder and
no electric,) if you can find one you are lucky.  I note now that to really
see how bad they are you have to peel back the insulation, which is likely
causing them to rust out anyway as it holds moisture and salt, but it may
also be asbestos so if you are a pansy ass run in fear.  To be honest that
isn't an iota of the asbestos you will be exposed to,  having abscounded 3
sets of exchangers from VWoA I found it laughable that they were replacing
the exchangers and "sampling" from them when the bulk of the asbestos from
the flex tubes, flex tube seals, and particularly the insulating mats on the
bottom of some exchangers, had it become liberated would have ended up
residing in the corrugations of the main and distribution tubes, that is
probably along with road dust the bulk of what a prior listmember has noted
builds up in these tubes and told you to clean out.  Anyway take precautions
as you see fit, I leave it there.  So your Y and your distribution box are
rusted out, your options, find replacements or ingenuity, as mentioned the
air directly out of exchangers is HOT, but I did use a plastic Y at that
time to replace just the tip of the Y section, it was a modified piece from
the front distribution ducts of a bus, connected with flexible tubing.
McMaster-Carr sells a Y adapter (5398k19 old pn) for car garage exhaust that
is 2-2.5" and 2.5-3" out, made of cast aluminum for $20, would work nicely,
they also sell a number of fiberglass, silicone impregnated, wire coil hoses
that are good to 550F or above which I have used extensively in direct
contact with exchangers and exhaust components to replace missing parts on
Vanagon systems.  Good stuff, can be $6-$10/ft so you need to plan
carefully.  For the manifold distribution box your choices are poor, a good
solution if really bad and you can't find one is just to pipe it straight
ahead with tin pipe and forget the rear, if your box isn't too bad, welding
patches, whatever.  So basically you check the condition of all these parts,
you might take apart and blow out all the hoses, I'm a bit leery here not
for asbestos but because it is very hard to get the paper off without
destroying the ends and the bent pieces for the rear are very fragile and
apt to split.  There are NO good replacements for these pieces that are
inexpensive and nothing I've found to be insulated like the factory parts so
make your decisions.  If my manifold and Y were solid and all the joints
look tight, I'd never touch a thing.
  Anyway goes without saying we must also be sure that both exchangers,
flapper valves, and flex pipes are solid and that all the joints between all
the pieces are tight.  These are NEVER put back together right by casual
mechanics.  The thing I hate the most about air cooled vans is dealing with
the heater stuff when installing an engine, it can take HOURS to get
everything to fit right on a '73-'83 vintage van.  The aftermarket (Dansk)
boxes never fit well to all the little connector pipes and the pipes are
usually rusted, the front joints from heater box to riser pipe are
particularly bad, especially if oval not round (they differ by year and
exhaust.)  Also the rear joint where heater box meets fanshroud should have
1 way flapper valves and should be gasketed with molded asbestos gaskets.
Those gaskets are impossible to keep intact and are usually gone and NLA I'm
pretty sure.  Just using silicone at that joint doesn't help because the
gasket spaces things and makes the flappers work.  I use a 3m product putty
that is made to firestop conduit passages through walls etc, find something
and use it (1/8" silicone rubber sheet would work  nicely as the input end
of the exchanger isn't likely so hot.)  For the other joints on the front of
the exchanger, the exchanger to flapper risers, etc, high temp silicone.
And hose clamps or restoration of the origional welded on clamps or whatever
to make all those joint PERFECT.
    Flapper boxes, OEM have asbestos seals on bus years, replacements have
nothing, Vanagon have silicone rubber seals,  the boxes aren't compatible.
You want that flapper not to leak when it is in the heat forward position
blocking the vent, do whatever strikes you.  The seals to the flex tubes,
again dreaded asbestos, the Vanagon has silicone rubber (red or black) these
do fit (well ones off the straight tube of Vanagons) and are a great thing
to buy or scrounge in a yard.  Beyond not being asbestos they simply work
100% better and are easier to get together and seal perfectly.  You will
have to deal with and remove the old ones, use a mask, do whatever, run and
hide and you shouldn't own your bus.
     Cables are about the only thing left in the stock system, they have to
work or you can just wire the flappers open to some convenient thing like
the cable brackets.  Your choice, they are still available and fairly cheap.
You can get some adjustment out of your existing ones (they tend to stretch)
if you can get the barrel nuts apart and working (replacing these and
coating everything with antiseize on reinstallation is a must) and something
that strikes me, now is a good time to remove and repack your CV's cause
acess to this entire area is greatly improved by the removal of the axles.
If you are cheap and ingenious you can cut the end off a stretched cable and
crimp a home fabbed new end on, or use one of those accelerator cable repair
kits to shorten the cable, but like I said new are about $15 each?
    So there we are, in a roundabout way (sorry,) the origional system is
intact and solid all the way from booster fan to front vents, leak free,
cable system fully opens the flappers (disable cable that ducts rear if you
remove manifold box.)  Right now the bus should heat better than it ever
did, with one or 2 occupants it might be liveable on a good trip down to
about a 30-40 F day (might give you 50F inside at the front and keep
windshield clean) but I was driving every day 70 miles 2 ways in subfreezing
weather alone, I posted way back when exact numbers but the temp rise in the
front vents with the system in this (good) shape was somewhere like 15-20F
above ambient IN THE VENT not in the cab.  With one person in the bus I had
to layer very heavy clothes, coat, gloves, and a clear windshield was not a
given and I probably was hypothermic when I got to work.
    So the recirculation, on the stock electric fan there is just enough of
a lip on the intake to attach a close fitting piece of hose (don't recall
size, I don't think bug/bus hose is big enough, I used air intake hose from
the parts store.  Glued on with silicone and attached with the narrow German
style hose clamp or a band clamp it will stay if not disturbed as there is
likely a slight negative pressure in the fan suction.  Where to go with it,
therein is the question.  YOU GOT TO CUT A HOLE IN YOUR BUS, not much other
way around this, you want air out of the interior to recirculate, you
ideally want it from low in the rear which is perfectly where the coldest
interior air (but still warmer than outside) will be.  On that '76 my
solution was as follows.  I had a bunch of scrap front air vents out of
front dashes and the vents that on a passenger bus are fed by the tubes on
the front doors.  This little plastic vent looks nice and fits into a little
aluminum collar that snaps though sheet metal.  I carefully used an
appropriate hole saw to cut a hole on the right rear interior pillar for the
vent.  BUT the gas filler is back there, and the overflow system and gravity
locks and whatnot are back there, IE lots of gas available to drill into, be
carefull when choosing a location.  Now the size of the fan intake and this
vent thing weren't the same, I fabbed a little aluminum reducer for the vent
I believe to get down to the hose size, plumbed it all together using
silicone at the joint though the sheet metal, removed the flapper from the
plastic part of the vent (snaps out), cut a neat hole in the black trim
panel and snapped the vent though into its housing.  It all looked quite
nice and basically stock.  It occurs to me on a westy you could probably use
the stock rear underseat vent plumbed elaborately up through the tin
somewhere but you would lose a lot of heat from the air you were pulling.
Likewise you could take route similar to the SW gas heater output vent
though the firewall beside the gas tank and out under the rear seat but that
is pretty involved with the engine in situ.  Up on the pillar seems to be
the best option IMHO, can go through the floor of the luggage compartment
but then it gets covered up.

So bottom line benefits, on the 70 mile daily trip, temps were raised quite
a bit as the trip went on, I think (but I haven't had this bus for 5 years)
that I was looking about 30 minutes into the trip at heat 30+F higher than
ambient coming out the vents, may have even been better.  This bus also
featured a nice 1" layer of fiberglass insulation above the headliner and
similar behind all door panels, another real important element in heating a
bus.  I do know I could then comfortably drive on a 15-20F day without my
heavy coat and heavy gloves and have a nice clear windshield at all times
and not die on a hour and a half trip.  For '68-'71 buses your solution is
quite simple as well, buy one of those bug kits and plumb them with seperate
fans for each side into the interior, should work fabulously.  Vanagons
without the electric fan but with the alternatir mounted fan should be
possible as well, just plumb into the intake of the alternator fan, meant to
try this on the '81 but have not yet done so.  The funny thing about all of
this is that the Bus handled so much better in the snow compared to my '85
Vanagon that I still preferred to drive it without heat.  A bus is really
predictable and "tossable" in the snow, a Vanagon is sort of lethargic and
unpredictable.  I often plowed along though 12+ inches of uncleared
interstate in the morning and would never think twice about hopping into the
rutty passing lane to blow by idiots driving Blazers 30mph.  Good tires and
a sensible driver and a Bus will go anywhere, once had to argue my way out
of a ticket for passing a moron MD state trooper (kid) who couldn't get his
Crown Vic going more than 40mph without the ass end all over the place,
fortunately the judge liked the fact that I worked for a defense contractor
and was a proven safe driver.  I've always considered it amazing that we
east coasters destroy out infrastructure and vehicles with salt because we
can't learn to drive while friends of mine who came from real snow states
(ND and the like) find us all comical when 4 inches of white stuff hits the
ground.

For campers with propane a Propex is a nice solution as well.
