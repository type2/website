   <h1>I'm back as well.</h1>
   <b>ja_at_decws3.coe.wvu_dot_edu (John Anderson)</b><br/>
   <i>1995-08-22 02:50:24+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>   Damn I don't know why I'm back here but it probably has
to do with the fact I just bought the two most recent Westy
Buses advertised on rec.autos.vw.  So i figure it is support
group time again as I don't know much about them later
Westy beasts.
   Sadly I did this as my '71 met an unitentional firey
end, suffice to say, change your fuel lines and avoid
a rear ending by a 2+ ton truck driven by a drunk with
4 or 5 DUI charges.
   But onto the gloating, if anybody wondered the guy advertising
the MINT '77 for the last few weeks was far from lying. Although
only a standard model with no stove/fridge it is perfect, origional
paint/rubber like new.  He owned for 1 year buying from the origional
owner, who had all records kept.  This thing has had it's oil
changed every 3000 or less (often less) meticulous nay anal
care, hell it had over $4400 in receits from '88 - '93 primarily
over $2500 invested on the A/C which probably only leaked because
it was never used.  Garaged it's entire life I have never seen better
and I have looked at 30+ Buses in the last 10 years.  He wanted
$4700 I gave him $3900, I figure I could sell for $5000 today if
I posted pictures.  Hell to show the anality of the origional owner
every tank of gas put in the Bus is documented as to where it was
purchased, how much in, how much paid, mileage, etc. etc.  The
thing is amazing.  My sister and I bought it for my mom and dad for
their 28th anniversary so truly, it is not mine (yet) and they
are tickled to death, they looked at a camper back in '75 before
buying our '76 Bus and didn't get one because they decided a fmily
of 5 wouldn't fit on normal jaunts.  With the A/C and the 2.0 it
is nicer than a Vanagon since it has more style. 
   Onto my new Bus though, a guy in Maryland advertised a '78
with 136,000 I went to look and fell in love, although not garaged,
she has never seen winter driving and has no structural rust, totally
solid but hasn't been waxed in 5 years at least and surface oxidation
is horrible plus all the rock chips have bubbled into rust, still nicer
than any I have ever seen in the salt belt.  She is a Deluxe camper
with A/C and a GAS HEATER (which scarily has never been used by the
current owner of 12 years).  It has a major problem with one rear hatch
hinge being sprung which I have not fully investigated as I pick her
up this weekend.  Window rubber is mostly shot but canvas has not a rip and
interior is fairly immaculate.  Overall with paint and rubber she would
sell for $2000+ I paid a whopping $400 as the guy is an older gentleman
who has been paying $45/hr labor for a bunch of recent repairs (starter,
wiper motor, inition switch all new) and he got fed up.  He has
maintained it perfectly running wise though, and I almost wanted to
give him more as he is very nice, but that's what he wanted.  I figure
I could fix the hatch and turn it over for $1500 if I wanted to.
   Anyway enough gloating, now for a few real questions, I want to
pull the dual battery system and fridge from the '78 and toss it in
the '77 for mom and dad, is it worth doing?  The units are physcally
identical and the swap looks easy enough, also does the 2nd battery
only charge off the AC charger or does it also pull off the alternator?
I would fit the stove unit but it would involve putting holes in the
Bus, a no-no for collectibility reasons.  Another question, what about
oil for these, the origional owner of the '77 religiously changed
spring and fall, straight SAE 40 and 30, though the 30 weight usually
only saw 500 miles between October and May.  As 10W40 scares me I
used Shell Rotella T 15W40 diesel grade oil for the rest of summer,
seems a nice solution, the viscosity modifiers don't work over a 30
weight spread.  I'm going to put RedLine MTL in the tranny as soon as
it gets here, and changed to Bosch Platinum plugs but otherwise can't
find a thing to do to the '77.
  OK I've gone on and on, flame away on me, the '78 is a great find,
so I'll keep gloating. Oh and BTW, looks like dad is going to sell
the ***avan now that he's got the Bus to use if he really needs a second
vehicle.

PS some happy driver of a real clean earlier bay window white Westy
passed me on I79 south in WV as I drove the '77 home, we both waved
emphatically, did I see anybody?</pre>
