   <pre>Thanks for thorough comparison!  I didn't know about that article on the
t2 site so I'll go find it.  Also, I found an article on the
aircooled_dot_net site that says the engine should be run at 2500-4000 on
the initial run because 2000 rpms don't properly oil the cam.  hmm..
here's the link:

http://www.aircooled_dot_net/gnrlsite/resource/articles/engnbrkn.htm

Another difference that I noticed between the aircooled and the
motorcycle procedures is that the motorcycle one says never to lug the
engine, and the aircooled_dot_net one says it's ok to lug the engine. 
hmm....
