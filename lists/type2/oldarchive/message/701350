   <h1>red Rock Canyon trip report</h1>
   <b>stafford_at_alcor.hac_dot_com (Jack Stafford)</b><br/>
   <i>1995-03-27 19:57:31+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>  Friday morning I trundled out to the camper and headed North.
As I pulled off the 55 fwy I noticed Scott Harvey's Vanagon.
We arrived at the predetermined Shell station at the same time.
I topped off the fuel and we both continued on to Norco.  
  Dave Schwarze would join us at a Burger King.  After more brief
introductions we rolled Northward to I-15. A fuel stop for all
in Adelanto along highway 395.  Fuel was about $1.40US/Gal. for
unleaded.
  This stretch of 395 runs through the Western side of the Mojave
desert.  Joshua trees and mesquite bushes dot the rolling hills
and mountains to the West.  Blue, yellow and violet wildflower
patches appear now and then.  Clear blue skies make the scene
complete.  This is one of the best times of year for visiting here.
  We turn left at Johannesburg and drive East past Randsburg to
catch highway 14 (which used to be highway 6).  A mile or two up the 
road is the Red Rock Canyon State park.  Fifty to eighty foot cliffs 
marred by centuries of erosion surround the camping area.
  The rate was $7.00US per night. The area had pit toilets and
running water, picnic tables and fire rings.  The ranger held 
weekend talks at the visitor center.  I never made it down there.
  Some of the vanagon_at_lenti folks were already camped when David,
Scott and myself arrived.  We joined them around 12:30. Nearly
every generation of transporter made it except the EuroVan.
  The campsite near Martha and Bradley seemed like the best place
for a communal meal and fire.  We had a roaring fire which helped
cut through the ~40F degree temps.  
  I didn't bring enough warm bedding so I froze my ass off in my
camper that night.  I remember waking up in the middle of the night
and the one flimsy blanket I had was stiff from the cold. :-#
  Not only did the guy driving the '59 single cab (can't remember
your name) have a nice old truck, but flipped a great blueberry
pancake.  After breakfast we embarked on our off-road adventure
to the Burro Schmidt tunnel.
  We drove along the road from the 14 to Randsburg a few miles and
took a left up into the hills.  It started out as a one lane dirt
road which crumbled into a rough, one lane dirt road.  Further on 
it deteriorated into a washed-out, rough, one lane dirt road.Bradley
got stuck and unstuck.  We decided to turn back when faint signs 
of a road were traded for an arroyo.
  Up the paved road a few more miles we found the *real* dirt road
to Burrow Schmidt tunnel.  We also found our compadre from Arizona
in his '69 bus along the trail.  It was about 8 miles to the spot
we were looking for, a half-century old shack of a building.  It had
all kind of antiques (junk) around the 'yard'.  The old lady that
lives there witched her own well, has a tractor, pickup, cherokee
and sedan.  Solar panels, propane and a satellite dish complete the
amenities.  I signed the guest register and walked up to the tunnel.
  Burro dug a tunnel in the early part of this century.  It's
through a mountain top and seems to go nowhere.  Maybe it's the
result of prospecting.  He spent 38 years digging the ~1/4 mile long
tunnel by hand.  We all took a walk through the tunnel to the other
side. The view was incredible at the other end.  You could see the
Randsburg/Red Rock road, Koehn Lake and the mountains on the other
side. Everyone shuffled through the tunnel single file again. 
Rumbled back down the mountain and West to Randsburg for a late lunch.
  Back at the camp that evening we had some more grub Great tamales!
and an even bigger fire.   We laid on more of Martha's parque floor
and some computer hardware (for color).  Drank some beer and mulled
wine to the tune of David and Susan tickling the ivories of a portable
piano keyboard.
  I froze my ass off again.  I woke up in the pre-dawn hours frozen.
I remember looking out the windscreen of my bus at the fire.  I thought 
about throwing another five or six logs on and laying in the dirt next 
to the fire ring to keep warm. It was only a thought.  I should have 
brought flannel instead of prunes.  The stiff, cold blanket was all I 
had and I made due 'till the sun came up.
  In the morning we started to pack up and get ready to drive home.
I was such a nag about saving the empty homebrew bottles.  With the
help of Dave's beer-drinking friends from China Lake I  actually came
home with more bottles than I left home with.
  Most of us drove South on highway 14 to Mojave.  From there we just
scattered to other parts of the state on our own.  I filled my tank with
unleaded at $1.14US/gal. I chose to take the 58 East along the Northern 
edge of Edwards Air Force Base.  I recognized the scenery from watching 
the Space Shuttle landings on TV. Telephone poles and RR tracks.
  From there I took the 395 South to I-15 and back into the smog of
San Bernadino and Riverside.  From the Cajon Pass to the coast, drivers
were mad.  Weaving in and out of traffic and generally driving like their
hair was on fire.  I stayed in the right two lanes at around 65 mph, just
like Friday's convoy with David and Scott.  The crazy drivers around me 
made up for the fact that I missed the NASCAR race on TV this weekend.
I just let them put me a lap down.  All I wanted to do was get home and
avoid a DNF.  ;-)
  Looking forward to the next net_dot_camping event,
