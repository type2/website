   <br/>
   <pre>A Cautionary Tale, for those planning the caravan.
 
 
Back during the oil boom days me and a buddy, David, were driving
from Dillon, Montana up to Chetwynd, B.C. for a job surveying
seismic lines.  I'd be working illegally, while David was a
Canadian. We got to the Sweetgrass border crossing about 1 in the
morning.  It was early February, snowing, about 10 below zero, 40
mph winds.  Typical high line weather.  All the motels were full,
so either we spend one very cold night or press on for Calgary.
Only problem is my buddy is carrying a rather large stash.  Pot,
some shrooms, bit of coke, the usual sort of recreational
supplies that fueled America's search for new petroleum energy
resources back in those days.  David had already spent one year
in a Canadian jail for this sort of thing, and neither of us
wanted to try our luck at the border.  So, we stopped at the
truck stop, filled up the bus and cleared out the empty bottles.
Then we ate all the drugs.  David shared fifty-fifty, so I paid
for the gas.  Then we drove up to the border crossing, hoping to
make it across before total paranoia set in.  When we pulled up I
left the motor running.  You could look in the window of the
guard station and see three Mounties, two old guys and a young
woman, sitting there playing poker.  They glanced up at us, then
laid down their cards.
 
The woman must have lost the hand, because she came outside.  The
wind is really howling now.  I glance at David, he glances back.
I bang on the window to break it loose from the ice in the
channel, then slide it back.  The guard looks at me.  "Canadian,
or American?".  "One of  both", I exhale.  "Anything to declare?"
"No!",  David blurts out.  The back of the bus, now, is totally
crammed with shit.  All the way to the roof.  David's stereo,
boxes of cowboy boots, hats, survey tripods, a Wild T2
theodolite, a laser, bundles of pin flags.  Beer's expensive up
north, so we're carrying a few cases.  Same with Scotch, which
always helps when you need permission to cross a rancher's land.
Why pay Canadian prices, we'd thought back in Butte, we'll be
smart and stock up now at a discount.  Rumor said there were a
lot of bears up where we'll be working, so I've got my 30-06,
David's got a .357, and we're carrying a couple hundred rounds
for each.  Someone told us you needed a permit to buy ammo up
north, so why take a chance, we'd figured.  Machetes to chop down
the brush.  A chainsaw to clear landing zones for the helicopter.
Snowshoes, spare felt boot liners, and so on.  It's clear to even
a casual observer that we're not headed for our winter holiday at
the resort at Lake Louise.
 
The lady stares at this pile, looks back at us, then takes a very
slow walk around the bus, peering in all 21 of the windows, her
boots squeaking in the cold snow.  She comes back to my window.
David stares straight ahead, slowly turning the stereo down, then
off with a final click.  I leave the engine running.  I'm
starting to wonder if it was really a good idea to hold back on
David and slip half my share of the stash behind his seat.  But
then what I had swallowed was, second by second, beginning to
seem like an even bigger mistake.  The lady finally spoke:  "Any
guns or ammunition?"  We told the truth.  "Any liquor?"  "Two
cases of Johnny Walker Black."  "Any knives?"  David pulled his
Buck out from his jeans and she glanced at it.  "Anything over
six inches long?"  I looked at David.  He stared back at me with
a look of total hopelessness.  "A Machete!",  I yelped.  It was
then that I knew this wasn't going to work.  She was absolutely
beautiful, I realized, and she absolutely knew that we were
stoned.  It was suddenly damn cold in that bus.  The snow blew in
around the ragged sunroof, melted on my head, trickled down my
ponytail, down under my collar.  Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to
just get out, go inside the station.  Probably she'd give us some
coffee.  Warm in there, I could tell.  I didn't have a record,
I'd probably just get sent back home.  Wouldn't Triple A cover my
bail?   I looked over at David.  He was sweating.  His eyes
didn't look so good either, not that he was really looking at me.
He'd never really talked about that year in jail, except to tell
me that someone he'd trusted had turned Queen's evidence on him.
He did the time, they got off.
 
"Ok", she said.  "Ok what?", my brain went into a panic.  "Ok,
get out, spread em?" "Ok, drive over to the holding area?"  "Ok,
turn off the engine and open up the side doors?"  My mind
couldn't really cope with this anymore.  What was she trying to
tell me?  Somehow it didn't seem wise to just ask her outright
what she meant. "Ok, have a nice stay in Canada", she said,
smiling and shivering at the same time.  I noticed she hadn't
bothered to put on her coat.  Inside, they were starting to deal
a new hand.  As she turned to go back,  I felt a strange
reluctance come over me then.  "Wait", I wanted to confess to
her, "wait, there's something I need to tell you.  Let me come
inside with you, inside where it's warm."  Then David turned the
stereo back on.  It was the Dead, playing the Mexicali Blues.  "
... is there anything a man don't stand to lose, when he lets a
woman take him by the hand ... "  I stepped on the clutch then,
maybe a bit fast, I don't know, but anyway the clutch cable
snapped, the clutch popped shut, the engine stalled.  She glanced
over her shoulder, smirked at me, turned back toward us.  You
could hear the squeak of her boot, turning in the cold dry snow.
"Oh God no", David whispered.  Inside, the younger of the two
guards stood up, reached for his parka.
 
A few words from Muir's writings came to me then.  It was as if
they were wafting in thru the defroster vents, even fainter than
the faint heat.  I thought:  "Wait, I know what to do, this is
something I can deal with, this is something I read about in a
book."  I left the bus in first, ground the starter, stepped on
the gas.  We lurched forward, got some speed, then I let off a
bit and slipped it into second.  We were gone.  I looked in the
mirror, the Mountie had already stepped back inside.  I could
hear David breathe again, even over the engine, the bad heater
boxes, and the wind.  He pulled my half of the grass out from
under his seat and started rolling a fat one.  "So, what would
you have done?", he asked.  I laughed and rummaged around under
the dash for the lighter.
