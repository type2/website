Derek, 
 I support your efforts.
 I hate to see class action suits against mfr especially litigations
 that result from greed or frivolous matters but my experience with VW
 shows that the individuals within the company that were involved had never 
 learned from their snob attitude during the handling of the Audi 5000 case
 which costs VW dearly.
 Unfortunately because of the decision of a handful of executives within
 the Corporate structure the company suffers financial damage that affects
 all the workers within that organization.
 Perhaps action like this will weed out those individuals within that
 company and thereby set an example for other companies to follow.

 Enterprises like VW must relearn that providing a good product to the
 consumer must be their ultimate goal. The profits will fall in line
 if this law is followed faithfully. If you make a mistake especially
 if some dumb engineer within screw up on the design make the correction
 immediately. Dont start using the army of corporate attorneys within
 to cover up. It will evetually cost you more. 
 Lets face it, if these lawyers were of real calibre, they will be
 practicing on their own and not for somebody. 
 
 A very large corporation that I used to worked for(sorry will not identify 
 it) followed this basic rule and eventually became one of the world's
 largest and profitable company. Not too long ago it too deviated from the 
 principles  laid down by its founder and paid a hefty price for its 
 decision.
