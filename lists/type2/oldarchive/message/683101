   <h1>Blind Man and the Elephant (long)</h1>
   <b>Bob Hufford &lt;bhufford_at_mail.orion_dot_org&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1995-08-22 17:30:33+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>It was a cold January evening.
I had just returned home from work and was scanning the
classified ads in the newspaper, looking for Volkswagens (you know, not to
buy, just to be "aware").  At the very end of the "Vans"  column (funny
how VW's end up at the tail end of any line) were these words:  "1968 VW
van. $200".  Boy, that caught my attention (why am I so attracted to VW's
under $500?).  I immediately dialed the number and discovered that this
Bus didn't run (blown motor), but had no rust (to speak of), a new
transaxle, and the owner was itching to sell.  I took down directions on
how to find it (out in the country about 20 miles away) and carefully
broached the subject with my wife...  "But honey, its only $200".  "What
are you going to do with it?" she asked.  "I could put that motor that I
have out in the garage in it and sell it for an enormous profit!"  "Yeah,
right".  But I had that look on my face (we Volkaholics have it a lot) and
with great enthusiasm for our impending riches she said, "Whatever".  I
was soon tooling down the highway on one of the darkest nights of the new
year, hurtling towards my redezvous with "Bus-Destiny".  After missing the
Farm Road I was supposed to turn on, I circled around, wound around, up
and down, and finally bounced my way up a washed out dirt road to the gate
of Farmer (we'll call him Brown).  It was as dark as the bottom of a newly
undercoated pan as I closed the gate behind me (didn't want to let out the
goats) and stumbled towards the illuminated farm house.  This was one of
those houses where you can't tell which side is the front and, of course,
it was the side completely opposite of where I was.  I was fairly
confident that no one would shoot me, as they knew I was on my way out
there, but, because it was so dark, I was still somewhat apprehensive.  I
finally found my way to the front (back?) of the house and was soon
traversing the frozen wasteland with Farmer Brown on the way to see the
Bus (I use the word "see" loosely here).  As we approached I could almost
make out that familiar shape, and as soon as we got within 15 feet, my
"Ever-dim"  flashlight revealed the Bus in all its blue and white glory. 
The '68 was actually a '69 and had the factory sunroof.  It appeared to
have the usual rust under the windshield, a very small bubble in the right
"dog-leg", and a small spot of surface rust on the roof.  The sunroof was
siliconed shut (obviously needed a new seal), the front seats were in sad
shape, and the Bus had been slightly "camperized".  There was a louvered
window on the driver's side, the rear seat had been replaced with a
"trunk" (?) and there was a small shelf above the luggage area.  It did
have the full-length middle seat and it was in great shape.  It was hard
to get a complete picture of the Bus in the dark, but this forced me to
look more closely at the details.  The cold, however, cut short my
crawling around underneath.  Farmer Brown explained that they had
purchased the Bus at a garage-sale a year earlier, spent mega-bucks having
a rebuilt transaxle installed, but made the mistake of nursing a motor oil
leak (he thought that she checked it, and she thought that he checked it,
and ... seized engine).  I figured that the Bus was in great shape (for
the price) and if I waited for daylight, someone would surely buy it
before I could get back to check it out in more detail.  Sometimes you've
just got to say "What the h---" and jump right in.  I made a lower offer,
which, not suprisingly, was rejected.  Farmer Brown soon had $200 cash in
hand and I had a new Bus ... and title trouble (It cost me another $100 to
get the title straight so I let Farmer Brown store the damn Bus for ...
well, its been over a year now).  The "make us a fortune" Bus still sits 
in the field, the engine it was to be mated to still sits in my garage, 
and I am still looking at other project VWs.  I have no time, no money and no
decent Volkswagen to drive or show.  But I have all these great stories
... ;-)
