   <h1>Electrical Issues</h1>

   <br/>
   <pre>Ok, I did manage to get out and work on the bus for a couple of hours.  I got my
first part in ($2.50 + S/H, thanks BusBoys) and needed to install it.  Also wanted to
test the battery I had on the charger.  Also, wanted to check the windshield wipers
out, and see what needs to be done.

First, the new part.  I got an accelerator cable.  No problems
installing, and now I'm not worried that while puttering about town, I will suddenly
have no throttle.  Being stuck in idle sucks.

So, next project, battery.  It actually came first, as I put the battery that had
been on the charger for 24 hours, and then on my floor for a few days, hooked it up
to the engine, flipped the switch, and click-nothing.  It had enough surface charge
to light up the battery light (I have a short! )  but not enough to crank the motor. 
So, that battery is off to the shop for a specific gravity test, and likely straight
out their back door after.  So, I need a new battery to call my own.  Not a big deal.

Last project for the day - windshield wipers.  The driver side one was not working at
all, the shaft/spindle was spinning, but the wiper arm was not responding to it.  The
passenger side was at a bit of a weird angle, off about 10-15 degrees.  It was ok,
operational.  I think.  I seem to remember me and Josh hitting the switch and they
worked. Anyway, I wanted to pull off the arms and see if I would need to replace the
shafts/spindles. at $40 a piece for spindle kits, I'd rather not.  The arms are only
$20 each from Bus Depot.  So, off came the arms. (a 10mm nut for each, the driver
side without washer, the passenger side with lock washer.)  From the driver side
spindle (I think that's the correct name for it), I removed first tin foil (Josh
admitted he had tried this quick fix without success) and then Duct Tape.  I cleaned
it up a bit with some WD-40 and a battery contact cleaner wire brush, and the
attempted to re-attach the wiper arm.  The fit seems to be a pressure fit, aided by
the splines on the spindle/shaft. (the hole in the wiper arm may also have some
splines in it, but if so, they are worn almost smooth - it seems more likely that the
spliny indents are from the shaft splines)  So I cranked pretty good on that little
10mm bolt.  Everything seemed pretty tight.  So, I did some swapping, and I ended up
with the passenger arm (both blades are shot, but that one was minorly better,
besides, I knew the arm tightened to the shaft ok on the other side, with similar
spline wear on the shaft, so if it were the arm, I had a better chance of getting
things working with this configuration.)  Anyway, the passenger side arm is on the
driver side, with the lock washer.  The driver side arm is now on the passenger side,
angle is corrected, and I found a flat washer to use temporarily until I can find a
lock washer for it.  Both wipers seemed firmly attached to the shafts.  If they
continue to be a problem, I think I'm going to get out my drill and drill a small
hole through arm and shaft/spindle, through which I can put a nail/cotter pin/baling
wire and make sure that the arms move in synch with the shaft/spindle.  I need to get
wiper blades.  The current blade-holders appear to be 15" while I thought the stock
blades were 14".  I will consult my tape measure before ordering replacements.  These
may be the next part I order for the bus.

Then there is electrical hell.  I mentioned I had a short.  (battery light on when
key not in ignition, not on while engine is running! )  The turn signal switch was
for shite, so it has been chucked.  The new one is $60 from BusDepot, and I'm trying
to hunt one down from a junkyard.  Better yet, my '74 bus has the old 73 and previous
style turn signal switch (which seems simpler to install and less stuff to send, but
it may cause some confusion at the various part-houses.)  In any case, in
anticipation of this short, I have been simplifying the wiring system.  The fuse
block is disconnected from the bus, hanging with wires sprouting out of it.  I have
no documentation which fuse is for what, and no hope that any order has been
preserved.  I am basically at the point where I want one hot wire coming forward from
the battery, and going to a fuseblock and then to the ignition, then having the
ignition switched wire going to a separate fuse block, and the proper relay wires
headed back to the starter & engine compartment.  Then, from those fuse blocks, I can
run lights (headlights, emergency flashers and brake lights from the hot block,
running lights, reverse lights, interior lights from the switched block), wipers
(currently not really hooked up or working as far as I can tell, I need to run power
direct to wiper motor and see if it turns over...)  I can also run hot from battery,
or off the alternator (how the f*** does one get to the back of that thing!!! ) to a
engine fuse/relay block to properly power fuel pump, ignition system (coil,
distributor), electric choke on carb, and whatever else actually needs power.  This
can all be nicely done off that relay line coming back off the ignition with clean
power from the battery... I can use a pretty basic relay to get it done, may have to
run a second relay for the fuel pump off a secondary oil pressure switch (this is
from a tip on having a budget safety shutoff on the fuel pump.)  So, rewiring the bus
is going to be a pain in the ass, but I think most of it can be done with the current
failure of a system in place.  I need a few relays, preferably 15-20 amp type, single
trigger should do.  I need some more wire.  I have a spool of bright yellow 14g.  I
want to run my main power forward at 12g, or even 10g.  The rest of it can be 14g.  I
need some other colors, too.  I have black 10g (or is it 8g) for grounds (brown would
be better, I know), but some red and green and blue would be nice too.  Then I need
some connectors.  Looks like a trip to HomeDespot. (can usually find connectors and
wiring cheaper than at FLAPS.)  Also, would anyone know where to get conduit similar
to what is currently running under the bus?  I don't mind using the flex stuff for
interior conduit, but if it's going underneath, it needs to be a bit more hardy.

Also, does anyone know where I can get a good (free? ) primer on wiring diagrams and
how to actually read them?  I despise auto diagrams.  I like to see diagrams that
include the actual terminals of the system I am hooking up.  The alternator/voltage
regulator/battery/starter/ignition system is pretty critical to get right on the
first try, so I don't want to screw it up too badly.  Any good diagrams of how this
system is supposed to be wired would help. </pre>
