Thanks Dave, it still is, and I don't mind either, anybody who wants to
smell my laundry can go right ahead, and since all the information you've
given is entirely relevant to the group I'm including it.

I agree that the booster is real suspect at this point, I've already been
through all other checks in the system, new hoses, new vacuum valve etc.  I
think the thing that clinches it is that as it's running now, if I am at a
stop light and just lightly touch the brakes, the boost holds and the engine
holds idle speed, but if I get heavier with the pedal, the boost breaks and
the idle climbs.  Strong indication the booster is gone, I have a spare from
my stripped bus and will get it in sometime real soon.  I have plugged the
lines and my idle problems are unrelated.

The heads are Berg 856 ported & polished stock size heads with his
'semi-hemi' cut.  They are 58 cc's per cylinder.  I have a final CR ratio
of, as far as I can calculate, 7.19:1 and promise to use premium fuel only.
The dizzy is a stinger S4 auto-retard, the advance works fine.  If you are
unfamiliar with  Bergs recommendations on CR and timing you can get and read
his catalog.  I am within his guidelines for advance on a low-CR engine and
don't agree that 32 BTDC is the limit for advance for such an engine set-up.
My coolest engine is at 13 degrees BTDC with 6.8 CR and dual FRD Dellorto
carbs, 009 dizzy, it has great power, mileage and engine temps.  With my own
engine, I have to admit to being a bit surprised by how it runs with this
advance, but hey, power, pinging and engine temps are my guidelines and I've
not heard even a trace of ping so far, even when I had it up at 20.  I'm
holding at 15 degrees BTDC and am actually having difficulty supressing the
urge to advance to 18, mostly because when I was on the open road I think
the engine temps were slightly lower at 20.  Don't try this at home, this
engine is certainly way different than even a stock engine with low CR.  The
exhaust velocity is very strong, and with over 500 cc's moving through a
stock size valve, I'm sure I have incredible turbulence in the chamber,
something I had in mind from the beginning.

Engine temps have been different than other engines, this engine, with
properly working thermostat and flaps, comes up to 180 and has stayed there
on the freeway at 65-70 mph during midday.  Other engines without
thermostats have stayed around 150-160, and hit 200-210 on hard climbs into
the mountains.  I haven't had this one up into the mountains, or really
pushed it hard yet, it's not ready.  We'll see.........
