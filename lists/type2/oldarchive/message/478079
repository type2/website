   <h1>Trip Report: into the Yukon</h1>
   <b>Eddiehintz_at_AOL.COM</b><br/>

   <br/>
   <pre>Hey now,
     We crossed into the Yukon territory this morning (26 July),  and are
heading for Whitehorse today. Most of the group is going off on the Campbell
highway, which is a gravel road, and will take 2 days to get to the vicinity
of Carmack, where we will regroup and camp at Frenchman Lake. Bob Hoover and
myself have chosen the paved route to defray damage to our vehicles, Dennis &
Sheila are also enroute to Whitehorse so Shelia can catch a plane home to
California-she has to work on Monday-and Ron Lussier headed for Whitehorse to
try and get his loaner computer working. We plan to get to Whitehosrse today,
but don't know if we will continue on to Frenchman lake tonight, or stay in
the vicinity of Whitehorse.
     Last nights campsite was at Liard hotsprings, where we were all able to
take it easy for virtually the first time on this trip. We only drove from
Ft. Nelson that day, so we were all at the campground by about 3-4 pm, and of
course we all went for a soak in the natural jacuzzi. I'm a bit bushed, as a
group of us sat around the fire for quite some time last night, talking
busses, Grateful Dead, and other goodies of common intrest. Neil & Ninic,
Dennis & Shelia, Jorge & Ivita, Jack Stafford, and myself all sat around the
fire with some Molsen Canadian and generally enjoyed ourselves. It's quite
odd up here-it's almost always light outside. The sun sets around 10:30-11
PM, and it finally gets dark at about midnight. Then comes the wierd part-by
1AM it's already starting to look like twilight in the sky. Very odd. Jorge,
Ivita, Jack and I all went to bed at about 1 am last night, but I had to get
up earlier, since Whitehorse is a 440 mile drive from Liard hotsprings. So, I
was up again at 5:30, and we were on the road by 6:30.
     The Alaska highway is a very rural sort of road. 440 miles on I5 is
nothing, 440 on the Alaska highway is a *very* long day. Your top speed tends
to be around 50-60, but there is a lot of wildlife that you need to be on the
lookout for. Yesterday we saw 2 black bear, a buffalo, a couple caribou, and
a whole mess of moutain goats. The road is under construction all over the
place, so we are often forced to reduce speed and/or wait for flagpersons to
wave us through. Another thing that's different about Canada, at least on the
Alaska Highway, is the flag people. In the states, flag people tend to be
male, and of the MillerTime persuasion. Up here, they're almost invairiably
young women. Cool, and different. 
     One thing that has been a bit difficult to get used to is our lack of
caravan skill. We almost never seem to have a real regulated caravan going-it
turns into 2 or 3 smaller groups, going several different speeds. Maybe this
will change on the Dempster Highway, but I kind of doubt it. Having ridden
with motorcycle clubs, I'm used to a very tight group formation, with one
rider taking the lead and everyone keeping formation. Here, one bus takes the
lead, then a small group gets in front and goes faster, others fall behind,
we stop for lunch and half the group will leave before the rest, etc. Kind of
a bummer for me, as part of the fun is the group effort. I guess bus owners
are too independent for that sort of thing though...  ;-)
      As we go farther north, the trees are becoming much more scrubby.
They're smaller and more sticklike, and very little green is found below
about the 6-7 foot line, presumably because they are under snow most of the
year. It's becoming more desolate between gas stops as well, sometimes 200+
miles between gas stations. The veiws are still spetacular, although it's
becoming commonplace. It will be weird to be back in Texas, with the scrubby
trees and the hot weather, after this trip. And whenever I see the national
weather on TV, I'll have a picture in my head when they talk about the
snowstorms in Canada.
     This morning we got to visit the signpost forest in Watson Lake. It
began during the construction of the Alaska highway, when a lonely worker but
up a sign showing how far it was to his hometown-kind of like the signpost on
the old MASH TV  show. It has grown to a huge assortment of signs from around
the world-we saw Croatia, Germany, Austalia, and Switzerland represented, as
well as all kinds of places in the states. Little places, like Carlsbad CA,
San Saba TX, Peoria IL, and Elk Creek CA. We got a picture of my dad in front
of the Elk Creek sign, as it's just outside of his hometown, Willows, CA. We
ran out of time, so we found a Texas flag license plate and took a picutre of
me next to it-couldn't find Austin, although I'm sure it was there. It was
neat to see some of the places I've known-such as Lomita CA, and Fort Bragg
CA-which we just drove through maybe a week and a half ago.
     I hope to send these off in Whitehorse, but may have trouble finding a
phone, so we shall see. In the meantime, I'll keep writing and storing the
reports for transmission whenever possible. As always, our good wishes to
those at home in thier comfortable mosquito free houses...
Peace,
Eddie</pre>
