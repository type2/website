middle seat was missing. The guy who owned it had the engine top-end rebuilt by the 
local service station... and then it dropped #3 valve seat a few thousand miles later. I 
think the van cost me something like $850, and it was in very nice shape overall.

When I got it, besides that, I had to replace all the seals in the engine shrouds. I 
figure the service station didn't want to be bothered putting them back in, and the 
owner didn't know the difference. This, along with the engine compartment being left up, 
(water got into the engine shrouds, so the little flappers all rusted, or rusted off) 
cost me more than it cost to put the engine together. I walked out of the VW dealership 
with a small bag of parts, and about $350 lighter (just for "nonessentials", mind you).

The side door must have been open, and driven into something. The side slider was 
damaged, but no damage to the rest of the body, with a nice crease in the former. When I 
replace the rollers on the bottom of the door, I was amazed how well it slid. Here I 
thought they just slid hard. <grin>  A bit of body work on the door, and the rear 
corners (is there a VW owner who doesn't dent these corners?)... and the body was ready 
for paint.

Here came the fun part. Ok, it's New Year's Eve, and I'm at my father-in-law's house, 
with the van parked in gravel (he had a compressor, but I didn't). By the time I get the 
bodywork finished primed, sanded and ready for paint, the sun had gone down, and the 
temp dropped from its glorious 50 degrees, down to something just above freezing.

Now, I learned to paint in conditions not much different than these. I took the full 
class at our local community college... and had completed the body portion... to be 
followed by paint classes the following year. That summer I picked up a job doing body 
work for the local school bus garage. The body/paint shop was in a shed with no heat and 
an open door. This wasn't bad in the summer, but when I returned during winter break, 
(they had damaged more busses by this time) it was an entirely new experience. If you've 
ever painted a car, you know that it has to be 70 degrees to get paint to stick, you 
have to apply enamel with 85 pounds of pressure, and you can't feather the paint out to 
help it match (this is a job for laquer, because enamel is too course). Not knowing any 
different, I went ahead... and dried the paint under a large heatlamp, made out of an 
old stadium light mounted on a pole. (The baseball stadium next door had replaced their 
old lights for the newer, more energy efficient, models. The old lamps would blister dry 
paint off the side of the bus, if it was put too close.)

So here I was, back to the good old days. August had a 350 watt "troublelight", that 
provided illumination, as well as heat.  Before I began painting, I put a heater in the 
van and closed the door, to get all the panels nice and warm (90 degrees inside that 
van, I would guess). These preparations made, I finished removing all the lights and 
trim that would come off, and masked the rest... and at 6PM I began painting of the 
lower half of the van. (VW calls that color something like desert tan, but it still 
looks yellow to me. It took me an hour to find the color in the chip samples.) I put the 
paint on in VERY light coats. It took 4 times around the van to put it on as heavy as 2 
normal coats, following each by an external warming with the heat lamp (moisture wants 
to accumlate in the paint at these temps).  Needless to say, the paint flowed out to a 
super-high gloss, because drying time was about 20 times longer than normal. Except for 
2 small sags under the rear bumper, it was probably one of the best jobs I've ever done.</pre>
