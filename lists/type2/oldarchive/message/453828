   <br/>
   <pre>Hello all.  Well once again I am composing this message on my word 
processor and hoping that the word wrap feature will work unlike my 
rotten text editor that I normally use where I have to <CR> every line.

I've been working on my 71 Westy and I thought I would tell about 
how it's been going so far in hopes that it will benefit anyone who 
wishes to read.

I wrote this post once already and now I can't find where I saved it so 
here I go again. :-(

It all started a week ago when I wished to reboot and grease my CV 
joints.  I figured I could get this done in a weekend no problem but of 
course, one thing has led to another.  First the drive axle on the 
passenger side came off and I cleaned it all up and regreased and 
rebooted everything but somewhere along the line, I noticed my rear 
wheel had some play in it.  Removal of the axle nut entailed getting a 
1 13/16 socket with a 3/4 drive t-bar of my grandfather's and using a 
4 foot cheater to break it loose.  I did this to the other side as well 
because I always do bearings in pairs.  I've done this rear bearing 
thing 2 times on bugs but never on a T2.  It's the same except for 
that my stub shaft housing didn't have notches for a punch to slide 
into to help punch the bearing out.  Being very careful to not drive a 
punch through my bearing, I got one out and then using a god-send 
tool of mine (just a piece of pipe with a nice rounded edge), I was 
able to drive out the other bearing.  The pipe is "EXACTLY" the size 
of a bearing so you only hit on the outer edge and not on the moving 
parts that are closer to the center.  It was apparent by the caked 
grease that this rear end needed to be relubed.  The original VW 
bearings were in this housing and they still look good.  I'm sure they 
are worn but I went ahead and cleaned them up, cleaned the housing 
they fit in to, and reinstalled them.  I'm using a bucket of black 
hi-temp disc brake and wheel bearing grease.  Man it's sticky stuff 
and it takes about 3 times with dishwashing soap to remove it from 
my hands.  I was able to get this stuff at a big automotive store not 
far from Mr.VW's house when I visited him in August.  Anyway, I 
moved on to the other side.  

Now the PO had told me that he had a bearing replaced by a 
mechanic and so I assumed that by the lack of lube on the 
passenger rear, that the driver's side would be the side with the 
replacement bearing.  After pulled the drive axle, I located a bad CV 
but I'll get to that in a little bit.  I pulled the bearings out and they are 
stamped, "Made in France TIMKEN."  So  this was the replacement 
side but the workmanship was so shoddy that the mechanic should 
have been ashamed with his work.  First off I noticed that there was 
no inner grease seal installed so that gravel and rocks were allowed 
to cake around the bearing.  Fortunately it is still firm as ever but I 
don't see how it managed to not self-destruct.  Then, the outer 
bearing dropped 5 of the rollers as soon as the stub shaft came out - 
just great!   I went ahead and cleaned up the CV's from this side and 
found that one bearing was stuff and had obviously ran hot because 
it had a bluish tint to it.  The balls were seized in the cage and one 
ball had a pit mark in it.  I suspect someone switched balls in this CV 
or mixed and matched parts.  I've never felt a CV with such rotten 
mobility as this one.  I'd grab the shaft and try to swing it around and 
the CV would lock up and I'd have to get a hammer and tap lightly to 
break it loose.  I've got a new CV on the way as well.
To top it all off, whoever lubed the CV's last only put on enough 
grease to lube the CV and the inside of the CV boots was dry.  I kid 
you not - dry rubber.  Common sense dictates you must put grease 
down in the boot.

Well at this point I was in a bind - no parts immediately available to 
install, so my rusted out rear shocks beckoned me and complained 
about the saggy ass.  Following the suggestions from several listees 
on the Type2 list, I got the NAPA coil over shocks.  I paid $44.95 each 
and got them the next day.  </pre>
