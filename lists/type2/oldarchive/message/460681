   <h1>Vacation in my hometown (long)</h1>
   <b>Monica Reynolds &lt;monicar_at_amazon_dot_com&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1999-07-11 16:58:12+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Vacation Vacation  vacationed unintentionally in my home town |:<
 I was headed to mountains in NY and PA.
I knew the lifters had to be changed before I left. It rained for three
days before I left. This really kind man (John) said he'd help me and
show me how to use my new tools(i was just a little scared i'd miss some
thing) the day I was suppose to leave it was sunny so we planned to do
it that day, on john ball joint let loose and he was pretty much stuck
were he lay for the day. I had good luck so far I thought why not wait
to do the job untill I picked up a friend in PA who was to join me on
this doomed Vaction. I got my oil professionally changed added some
mystry oil and took off the lifters sounded pretty loud and further I
went  15 miles on the highway 95 and the bus jerked and the oil light
came on (I was already  on the side of the road I could feel it coming
like you can feel a train coming before you run like hell over the
railroad bridge) I turned the key off there was an exit 200 yds ahead i
rested and then turned it back on punched the gas only a little to get
momentum then turned it back off cruised down the ramp to the
conveinently place gas station. then I proceeded to cry you know its a
girl thing....--my dear friend john said right before I left if any
thing happened to call him and he'd either talk me thru my problem or
come and rescue me. 
thank God  i wrote his # in my book cuz I found my self calling 
He was on his way within a couple hours hitching a ride from my roomate
when she got off work. Here I had broken down in a suburb where John use
to live  he determined it had to be towed or the engine pulled right
there which maybe wasn't the safest thing so I wanted to tow it and of
course I didn't get AAA before I left |=  John knew some one called and
got me a tow 45 miles to his house during a torrential monsoon (the kind
you gotta wait for it to die down before proceeding, here are these two
young men and John  fit my bus on a flat bed as wet as they'd be if they
jumped in the bay w\their clothes on) Cost me 100 bucks and breakfast.
Towed to John's house we took a few days of rest before the removal
process. it was 4th of july weekend ya know... On probably the hotest
day so far this year we yanked the engine. 3 gallons of water and 5
hours later we got the engine resting on a 4x4 wooden block stuck
between the engine compartment and the jack. with the jack stands maxed
out we couldn't raise the bus anymore plus the jack was under the engine
and we were both at the point of exhaustion.  two days later my uncle
who has amazing brute strengh came to rescue us. all three of us
together got it out. john and uncle lifting and I pulled the jack out.
I orderd a long block from the bus depot and an E-brake cables. how the
E-brake passed inspection is beyond me. I really have some resentment
building on a daily basis for the Mech. that I first took my bus to.
Being ripped off was to be expected but I see his whole evil plan now 
ya know its like the old commercial for V8 were the people going around
smacking themselves in the forehead saying I should of had a V8   I
don't know what I should have but I do have a bus and all I wanted was
honesty and he took me. Dave Green at Fair Hill auto (owner) in Maryland 
said when I paid him said "before you go on vacation(Ihad told him what
my intentions were) come back in so we can do a tune up and change yer
oil for ya. one week later I couldn't go more than 35 mph I called him
up. I took it in. the Mech. worked on it filling it w/oil ?? changing
the points?? and setting the timing??  I paid 2400 bucks and this is
what I get? I said the gas tank was leaking still then and the mech(not
dave) said yeh, when you bring it in for that schedual to get the two
oil leaks and the lifters done.*WHAT* as dave the wonder wave said as I
walked out of his shop in the begining said "OH you have a strong engine
we don't need to replace it.......sorry to vent like this I really just
wanted to tell you all what was happening. it sucks I need a joke.
even my back  up car is peeing on my head right now. yeasterday my uncle
and I replaced the battry, the starter and the seliniod switch  I made
it to work but I tried to go to lunch and the &(^%_at__at_! *FORD* won't
start.when it rains it pours ya know and the gods told me that in the
begining when we towed the old Lorax home. thanx for listening..........
