   <b>Derek Drew &lt;drew_at_interport_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1996-01-22 14:31:45+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>	Hello out there all you Bus, Camper, Vanagon, And Vanagon Camper fans.
It's been a
long time since we chatted and now that Summer is approaching, I felt the
urge to say hello to all
you "Bus fans".
	There is one subject that keeps coming up in various discussions.  This
topic effects all
of us regardless of what we drive, and eventually it will effect us where
ever we live.   It effects
the quality of  our lives in some areas and how much it costs for us to
drive in others.  It creates
laws which can govern what accessories go into our vehicles, and may someday
tells us what
vehicles we are "allowed" to drive.

	Can you guess the subject?
Emissions!
	That's right!  Emissions.  That nasty stuff that is produced in quantity
from anything that
burns.  As our automobiles burn fossil fuels to get their power, they
produce various nasty by-
products of combustion which get spewed into the air we breathe.  Although
we like to "believe"
that our cars produce only a small amount of pollution, there are so many
cars on the road that
the pollution problem is a big one.
	Consequently, various government agencies have decided that they need to
control our
automobiles in order to control the air pollution they produce.  These
controls include but are not
limited to new car emission requirements,  mandatory "sniffer" inspections,
and coming soon to
an area near you, Clunker Laws.  Who's fault is it that we have all these
laws that we don't want
or feel we don't need?  Ours!  Yes, Ours!  We love to drive, there are lots
of cars going lots of
miles, and they make a lot of pollution.  To make matters worse, most
people, (I know, not me!)
do not maintain their cars, or they make modifications and remove equipment
in the quest for
more "performance", (or to save money) without knowledge (or concern) of how
these changes
will affect the emissions output of their vehicles.  Depending on what study
we look at,
approximately 80% of all automobile related pollution is caused by less than
20% of the cars on
the road.  These cars are refereed to as "Gross Polluters".  These Gross
Polluters are the targets
that "Inspection Programs" and "Clunker Bills" are after.  Surprisingly,
there seems to be a very
limited attempt at regulating Diesel emissions, (except on new vehicles).
This is probably due to
the very small number of  Diesel cars in service and the Trucking Industry
having the Clout to
avoid this issue.
	During the past two years I have received a lot of requests from people
looking for help
to resolve their vehicles emission failure problems.  I am surprised at how
many repair facilities
perform these tests and have little or no knowledge what the results mean.
My experience has
shown that most emissions tests are focused on finding the Gross Polluters
and that almost all
failures can be corrected through routine repair/tune-up procedures or the
cause of failure can be
accurately determined through proper diagnostic procedures.  I will now
attempt to explain what
the tests are looking for and what repairs are indicated for each failure.
In the future, I will
identify and explain the purpose of the common pollution control devices
that our cars are
"blessed" with.
	Basically there are two types of Emissions tests in use.  Although they
appear in many
different forms and different manufacturers and types of equipment is used,
all the tests are
looking for the same gasses. All official test procedures also call for a
physical inspection to
determine that all of a vehicles emission control equipment is still in
place.  This is enforced to
varying degrees butt should be considered when thinking about removing
equipment to save
repair costs (removing Fuel Injection) or looking for more performance,
especially changing
camshafts and compression ratios.
	The most common type of test is the one that measures the exhaust gas
content with the
engine idling.  The test equipment is based on what is known as a Four Gas
Analyzer.  The
machine tests for Carbon Dioxide,(combustion efficiency), Carbon
Monoxide,(Incomplete
combustion), Oxygen content, and unburned Hydrocarbons.  This tester is
usually combined with
a computer or other operator interface so that test parameters such as
vehicle year, test limits
etc. Can be set.  This machine also uses an ignition pick up or other device
to monitor engine
speed during the test.  This insures that the engine is at a proper idle
speed as a high idle will
enable a poor running engine to pass the test.  This type of test will
eventually be required
everywhere.
	The other test is more complex and requires much more complicated equipment
including a Chassis Dynamometer.  This test is

often refereed to as the IM-240. This test actually simulates driving the
vehicle in real world
conditions for four minutes.  As the vehicle will be undergo changing speeds
and loads, the test
will be able to more accurately determine the performance of a vehicles
emission control
systems.   This test measures everything the above test does with the
addition of being able to
measure the actual volume of certain pollutants being produced,(grams per
mile).  It will also be
able to measure the oxides of nitrogen,(component of smog),( 3 way cat and
EGR system test)
as the engine will be operated under load.  This is the test system that
will be used  for most
state centralized emissions testing programs.  This test will be required in
many areas due to the
failure of the more reasonable testing procedures to accomplish their goals,
mostly due to
consumer pressure on the station operators and their willingness to cheat.
	  Now, what do all these tests mean and how do I get my car to pass?
Luckily, believe it
or not, VW has done an outstanding job in my opinion of keeping their
emission control systems
as simple as possible.  Although this was probably done with the idea of
keeping production
costs down, it has made systems relatively simple.  Many late model VWs do
not have EGR
valves, Air injection pumps etc.  Except for early fuel injection systems,
the VW product line has
always had much less non-sense stuff than other makes.  What is there, has a
purpose and is
usually easy to diagnose and maintain.  Sometimes, as easy as something may
be to repair, it
may not be cheap.   One problem with this simplicity is that it is more
susceptible  to improper
procedures causing nasty results.  For example,  If a GM car can idle at
all, it will probably pass
the first type test with ease.  If a Vanagon doesn't have the timing and
idle speed set by the
book, it will fail horribly.
	Lets look at the different gases and see what abnormal readings on these
gasses mean.
Whether or not your vehicle passes the emissions test, it is a good idea to
keep a record of the
readings from year to year.   This information can be used to spot trends
such as fuel system
degradation or an engine getting tired.
Carbon Monoxide:  Measured in percent, this is the result of incomplete
combustion.  In other
words, the fuel mixture has been compressed and ignited, but could not
complete the
combustion process due to the lack of oxygen.  This failure is always
mixture or ignition timing
related.  The ideal reading for CO is 0%.  A normal reading for CO is
usually around .25 to .75%
with 1.2% being the failure mark in most areas for vehicles 1984 and newer.
Earlier cars are
allowed higher readings.  Any car equipped with an Oxygen sensor will try to
run under 1.0% as
measured before the Catalytic converter,(use that test connection for
set-up).  A vehicle with a
CAT, O2 sensor, and an AIR system,(Air Injection Reaction) will read almost
0% with everything
working properly.  Most 70s cars should run between 1.0 to 2.0% with 2.5%
being the usual
failure point.  I find that 1600 dual port will run fine in this range and
with Fuel Injection, should
be able to run about .5 to 1.5 %.  Remember this is at idle so it is not an
issue with overheating
the heads and burning valves.  50s and 60s cars will need to run richer
still to remain smooth
running.  Anything over 3.5 to 4.0% in any car is cause for concern although
most test programs
allow up to 6.0% for early vehicles.  This is a lot of forgiveness in an
inspection program.  Over
advanced ignition timing will also cause high CO readings at idle due to the
idle speed control
being set low in order for the engine to idle at a reasonable speed.  VWs
are especially sensitive
to this.  Keep this in mind when using different distributors.
Hydrocarbons:  Measured in PPM,(parts per million),  this is the result of
unburned fuel making it
out the tailpipe.  This is different from the CO problem in that here the
fuel has not started
combustion at all. This failure is usually caused by an
ignition,(miss-fire), or an engine problem
such as a bad valve.  An engine running too lean will often have excessive
HC due to what is
called a "lean miss-fire".  Any leaks in the intake system or bad injectors
will also cause
excessive  HC due to uneven fuel distribution.  Vanagons are very
susceptible to the "lean miss-
fire".  Here the ideal reading again is 0 PPM.  Most  late model cars should
run under 100 PPM
with readings between 10 an 50 PPM being typical and a reading of over 220
PPM being the
failure point for must inspection programs.  Again, older cars are allowed
more freedom although
I find that most any car should be able to run under 400 PPM.  My 1923
Haynes runs at 300
to350 ppm HC and 4.0% CO.  High HC readings are a little more challenging to
trouble shoot
because there are so many possible causes including a mixture or worse, a
cylinder balance
problem.
Carbon Dioxide:  Carbon Dioxide is the end product of all Fossil Fuel
combustion.  CO-2,
measured in percent is an indication of an engines combustion efficiency.
The ideal is 14% with
most VWs running in the 12.5% to 13.5 range.  CO-2 output is affected by
timing,(valve and
ignition), compression, mixture, engine condition and temperature.  The
IM-240 tests will also
measure the actual volume of CO-2 produced and limits will be set according
to vehicle design.
If centralized testing is coming to your area, be very careful of any
modifications made to your
vehicle.  Even changes to your tires sizes and gear ratios will affect this
test.
Oxygen:  Measured in percent, is actually excess oxygen left over from the
combustion process.
If this reading is very low,  then you will also experience high CO.  In
boilers and other
equipment, we avoid high readings as that indicates excess air which reduces
heating efficiency.
In automobiles, we usually are looking for about 18%.  Normal atmosphere is
21%.  This is
controlled in late model vehicles by the Oxygen Sensor circuit.  The O2
sensor actually
measures the Difference in O2 content of the atmosphere and the exhaust.
When the
atmosphere has more O2 than the exhaust, a small positive voltage is
generated.  The Vehicle
Computer,(ECM), senses this signal and then adjusts the mixture accordingly.
You can measure
the fuel mixture of an O2 sensor equipped vehicle with a Digital
Multimeter(DMM).  If the mixture
control system is working properly, you should see the signal fluctuate from
.1 to .7 volts.  This
voltage correlates closely(not by design, just luck), with the actual CO
percent.  Ex. .5 volt is
approximately .5% CO.  This is great news as we could install a universal O2
sensor in any car
and use a DMM to set the mixture.  If you wish to do this, ensure that you
mount the sensor in a
"hot " area of the exhaust as it has to be heated to 600 degrees F in order
to function.  This is
why many cars included 86 and later Vanagons use a three wire sensor.  The
three wire sensor
actual has a heating element built in to preheat the sensor.  This enables
the sensor to go on-line
on a cold engine much sooner and keeps weather and driving conditions from
effecting the
sensor.  I find that earlier Vanagons often have problems with sensor
performance as the  sensor
is mounted far enough down stream in the exhaust that they don't get
adequately heated during
cold weather or when the engine is idling.  This also creates havoc with
emissions tests as
vehicles are often tested without being thoroughly warmed up,(car must be
driven to properly
warm up all emission equipment, especially the Cat.).
	So what does all this mean?  Well we went for our  test and we failed.  Our
van seems to
run okay but it failed. Lets review why.
	Failed the CO!  Check the Mixture and Ignition Timing.  Especially on VWs, over
advance timing will cause high CO readings.  When setting up ignition
timing, mixture, and idle
speed, follow the book. On Digijet Vanagons,  disconnect and bypass the Idle
Stabilizer when
setting the timing and idle speed.  Resist the temptation to "advance" the
timing for performance.
Also make sure both the vacuum and mechanical advance mechanisms are working
properly.
On Digifant Vans,  Disconnect the Temperature sensor before setting the
timing.  Again, resist
the urge to over advance the timing.  Check the O2 sensor system to ensure
it is working
properly.   Resist the urge to adjust the Airflow box.  If the O2 sensor
system is working properly,
it will compensate unless some one has already made a mess of things.  Also
check the oil,
diluted oil will also cause high CO readings.  Worn rings and valve guides
will contribute to this
also. However this will only be a problem on very tired engines.  Setting
the idle speed around
1000 rpm will also help keep the CO readings down.
	Failed the HC!  Check the ignition system first.  This usually caused by an
ignition miss.
Then check the engine.  Poorly seated valves, leaking head gaskets, or other
compression
problems will put the HC readings through the roof.  Also check for vacuum
leaks and the
injector spray patterns.  Remember, HC failures are usually caused by
compression or ignition
problems.  Improper fuel distribution/vacuum leaks will cause miss-fires
that will cause excessive
HC.
	Failed both CO and HC!  If the HC is very high and the CO is close, you
probably have
an ignition/compression related problem.  If the CO is very high and the HC
is close, than you
may only have a timing/mixture problem.  Use the above procedures
accordingly and you should
be able to resolve your emissions failure blues
	Next time, we will talk about all that infamous junk they put on our cars
to control the
emissions.  I will explain the purpose of these devices that you can better
troubleshoot your cars
and also to help you decide which equipment is worth maintaining or
discarding when searching
for more performance.  One thing to keep in mind is that much of this
equipment is put on our
cars because we don't maintain them. That's why some car manufactures are
shooting for
100,000 mile maintenance intervals.
	I hope this information will be helpful to everyone.   If you have any
further questions,
Please call or write.  If in a hurry, I can be more responsive if you call.
Just leave a message with
your number, time that you can be reached,  and a brief description of help
needed, and I will
return all calls as soon as possible.
	Till next time, Keep on Bussin!!!
