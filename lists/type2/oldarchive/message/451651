   <h1>Westy found! and SF-Seattle trip report (very long plus some plea</h1>
   <b>James Monberg &lt;jmonberg_at_microsoft_dot_com&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2013-05-28 17:18:08+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>So I've only been on the list for only a couple of months. Some members have
been very helpful with advice/wisdom/encouragement. I'm glad to say that my
search is over and I want to thank everyone that helped. I have a couple of
outstanding questions at the end and I fully expect lots of people to skip
over the admittedly verbose trip description :)

Backstory
I've been looking around most of the summer for a good condition 70's westy.
When I was a kid my family went all over Europe (pop in the military) in a
74 yellow/orange westphalia. That left me with a sentimental attraction for
the "merino yellow" color but otherwise just pragmatism (eventually) about
finding a straight bodied 2.0 FI. I've looked at ~9 buses, called on ~25,
and paid for 2 buyers inspections without finding the 'right' bus. I
eventually found out that I was looking I'm glad I was patient. There is  a
lot of garbage out there! whew -- glad I got that off my chest, looking for
a bus these days can be stressful. through all of that I did figure out that
I wanted something reliable, reasonably powerful, and the westy conversion
(as opposed to the more common (imo) ASI up here in the PNW) at a reasonable
price. i settled on a 76-79 westy and have been looking looking looking.
I'll spare you those experiences because I'm sure all of you can already
empathize with the getting your hopes up about he "clean, low miles, rebuilt
motor 1977 westphalia, perfect $2800" ad to find the
rusty-sat-for-3years-bent nose-rebuilt by the owners cousin Lou with some
aftermarket Napa replacements...

Needless to say there were some disappointments.

"the" bus
Early last week I called a woman in California about a bus she had
advertised locally (I had been casting my net in increasingly large circles
thanks to frustration in Seattle and the power of the internet). She had a
76 Merino yellow westphalia that she was asking $3000 for... She was the 2nd
owner and had maintenance records from 1976. The bus had 110,000 miles
total. No rebuild. I spoke to her for about 30 minutes and after thinking
about it called her the next night and we talked for an hour. I had her
crawling around with the cordless, checking under the rugs for rust, etc.
She mostly gave me useful and accurate answers. The bus had a recent front
brake job, new muffler, working heat, little-no rust, all original parts
except childscot, no bondo, but "needed new rear brake shoes." The total
miles were pretty low compared to the other buses I'd seen but I was worried
about the engine. Because it had oil changes and valve adjustments every
3-5k I was encouraged things might look okay -- I was half right
(foreshadowing)
 

As I was supposed to be on vacation last week anyway I starting feeling
tempted to fly down to the bay area -- at $100 that wasn't much more than
the amount it cost for a local buyer's inspection. After the second
conversation I was so tempted I actually just did it -- Last Wed had me
getting up early for some work, scrambling to the airport stopping only long
enough to pick up a new compression tester and some rear shoes. I took
minimal clothing and the tools I thought I would need and got on the plane.

The owner's partner picked me up at the airport in Oakland and we went to a
hotel parking lot where I started pulling it apart -- well, it must have
looked like that. I really liked the standard interior layout. I didn't want
to deal with a refrigerator and I loved the "well" icebox configuration. I
like the economy of space (any ideas on how to get more seating using the
space behind the passenger seat?) I was immediately impressed with the
interior quality -- no rips or tears, the orginal carpeting was in place,
all the upholstery was there, the cabinet veneer wasn't cracked.  A couple
of handles had the common splitting/electrical tape issue but were otherwise
functional.The exterior was almost as good. The only issues were the
occasional scratch, "freckles" on the nose where tiny rock chips had given
rise to rust under the paint (all spots smaller than a pencil eraser) and a
little bit of rust on the inside seam of the lower lip of the rear hatch. I
hadn't seen an unrestored bus with this little total body rust.</pre>
