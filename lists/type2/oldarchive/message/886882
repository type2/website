   <h1>hightail it down to mexico</h1>
   <b>stevo <stevo(-at-)efn.org></b><br/>
   <i>2003-12-27 08:33:36+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>we got on the road 12/04/03 in the 75 FI westfalia with no definate plans,
except a destination for baja sur, where jingle bells takes a back seat to
high water temps and good surf. along with my wife, three children ages 7,
4, and 11 months, and our 9 year old border collie we left from eugene. we
stopped off in mt. shasta and spent the night at the caswell state park
between tracy and modesto. the following morning  we essentially cut from
99 back onto 5 using 165 through los banos. then, about thirty miles before
grapevine i got two or three tugs reminiscent of the ones felt during the
trip last summer to port townsend. on that trip i learned what a cracked
rubber elbow on the aux air regulator can do. had one spare and i pulled
into a rest stop at the north base of grapevine to install it. too hot to
work on, i melted an ice cube in 30 seconds on the regulator and still had
to wait a half hour. i put the elbow on just so the tip of the elbow
covered the regulator. i think being too agressive and shoving the whole
sleeve thing on may have made it crack - dunno, need more data. made it
over that 4000' mountain and parked at the doheny state beach in san juan
capistrano. both parks are neat clean and well organized, but we didn't
stay long enough to enjoy them: just sleeping time with a d.i.l.d.o.e.
(duck in late duck out early). two days mostly on interstate 5 put us in
shooting distance of the mexican border. in the morning we took time for
two stops.

first i hit up the extremely fancy SJC dealership for a spare elbow or
three. no dice, but they did provide an immaculate throne fit for a king,
coffee, the new vw calendar, and a tip to head to unique auto in mission
viejo for aftermarket parts. great place, supply, service. i bought six
elbows for the trip (dint use any of them) for twelve dollars, no tax. the
replacement i had on board was from bow wow in seatlle and it cost four
bucks, same manufacturer, part number, go figure. listening to my engine
run, the fellers around back thought i probably wouldn't make it far with
the tapping sound. like the mechanics in eugene, and listees here, they
reminded me the cam rivets were the weak component in this engine. i was
glad to find they were in the process of tearing down a low mileage 1800
that had just sucked a valve, and offered me the sweet-looking camgear,
already bolted to its shaft, as travel insurance. second, we stopped at bob
greenup's in leucadia just before he headed off to the pomona swap. at
midday we crossed at tijuana with the wave of a hand.

by this point i realized that our timing was off, and some things had
gotten out of control which isn't an altogether terrible thing before
heading to mexico. in retrospect its probably to be encouraged. but at the
time it wasn't so funny. we left eugene at 10 am, roughly six hours late.
we left caswell around 10am, so we caught friday night rush hour in LA.
this was a notable problem since shifting into first gear, and downshifting
into second was becomming difficult. in capistrano i adjusted the plate at
the shifter, and it seemed all was well enough again. however, once again
on the interstate saturday morning i realized i was just an aircooled loaf
in a lexus-suv-world and late starts chunked badly into my sleeping time.
it was clear the vacation hadn't begun.

the early afternoon held me in tijuana while having the rear facing seat
recovered and exchanging into pesos. have you ever driven tijuana on a
saturday afternoon? DO NOT. 15 minutes to go one block on the main drag.
around 4pm we hit the toll road and the rest of highway 1. slept off the
side of the road near santa ynez. in the afternoon i ran outta gas 5km
short of guerrero negro and sat on my bumper to beg on the side of the road
with an empty gas can. three pemex stations closed in a row! first car
stopped and three mexican fullbacks got out and swarmed both sides of the
road looking for a makeshift tow rope. while that was going on, a farmer
from idaho stopped by a moment later. he hit me up quick with a gallon so
we could all continue. i knew gas mileage was gonna be an issue.

with the exception of my birthday dinner feast in san ignacio,
http://www.efn.org/~stevo/sanignaciolarge.jpg i drove all next day to a
trailer park south of mulege, that i found the next morning was called el
coyote, for another quick duck in. drove all the next day to la paz but
immediately got a sense the city wasn't in the cards this trip. with the
shifter getting worse, coupler i imagine, and a stronger desire to see the
children in the ocean rather than the sea of cortez, i decided to bolt
across the tip of the peninsula to todos santos. we arrived at nightfall.
from tijuana to todos santos i drove nearly a thousand miles and spent
about two hundred in gas, no oil burned or leaked. by the time we arrived
in todos santos it was too dark to find a dirt road to a beach. i stopped
in at the muerto pescado (restaurant, yup) asking for a lead on some
internet-researched campgrounds on beaches, but instead took an invitation
to camp behind the restaurant.  the restaurant was adjacent to an arroyo,
and firewood washes down with the rains. my four year old and i gathered
enough wood for a long fire while my wife heated thanksgiving leftovers
(?curried turkey in mexico?). having no business that evening, the owners
of the place joined us and we watched shooting stars until 10pm. five days
driving - we had arrived.

at this point we still hadn't gotten mexican insurance, nor paid for five
tourist cards issued in guererro negro, the baja sur border. we visited
federal checkpoints three times, each having sunbaked kids with a seemingly
silly seriousness. going down with a family is altogether different... "a
donde va...si, luego". whatever they're looking for on the way south it is
not in an orange bus with three kids.</pre>
