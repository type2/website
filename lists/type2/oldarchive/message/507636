David:
I agree with most everything you said, but a few remarks:
1. I agree that lightening a flywheel will make you need to be more
careful letting out the clutch, however, once that clutch is out
(provided the engine is still running) a lighter flywheel will help a
lot. I installed an aluminum wheel on my 1960 Corvette-283, Rochester
FI, 10/1 pistons, mild H-268 degree cam- higher, quicker lift. The cam
and the wheel were the only substantive changes. WOW, what a difference!
I can remember driving this thing in 1969 and having a lot of trouble
passing people on 2-lane roads- no more! I think the lighter wheel was
the biggest change.
HOWEVER! Is this Westy a sports car or a truck? Right now it's set up
like a truck. I think Matthew could be quite happy taking something off
the flywheel. I don't think he could accomplish the percentage reduction 
that I did with my Corvette(stock probably was 24 lbs, now maybe 12
lbs), nor would he be happy with that light of a wheel.(Ever drive a 2.0
911s with carbs? Pretty glorious AFTER you got the clutch out)
2. Stroker: good idea, no downside except expense.
3. High ratio rockers, not too bad, I'm sure they will reduce cam life
some, but is this a BIG problem in stock setup? I've seen many cams that
I wouldn't reuse, but many that were just fine.
4. 96mm NPR's If you can find them, I'd go for it. My experience was all
good. Be careful of overall c/r though. 7.5 or 7.6 MAX!!
5. I think I'd go with 41 and 34mm valves. Original equipment type
valves are much better in my estimation than any stainless steel types.
6. I'd NOT want any larger oil pump, higher pressure springs. If you're
driving through the desert, then maybe auxilliary oil cooler, but must
be temp controlled. I built a lot of street driven Chevys with big oil
pumps that leaked oil before I came to appreciate how good the factory
ones were: Had small pumps, didn't leak oil, still stayed alive okay.
7. I think to get much more HP you're going to need a bigger induction
system. Maybe modify 2.1 Vanagon parts to work. They are 90-100 HP
range.
