   <h1>Installing Ebenspacher BN-2 gas heater in Vanagon (long)</h1>

   <br/>
   <pre>     Fols, sorry it took so long.....guess that new Westy is taking up my 
     time! :)
     
     How I installed the BN-2 gas heater under the rear seat in my
     1980 Vanagon GL (Non-Westy):
     
      The BN-2 was originally fitted in the VW Bugs, I think. It is a
     cylinder shaped unit, measuring approx 18 inches long by 5
     inches in diameter. There is an inlet and outlet on each end,
     which tapers down from the 5 inch diameter down to a 3.125 inch
     diameter. The BN-2 heater has both the intake and exhaust
     openings located on the bottom of the heater. The inlet hose is a
     flexible hose about 1.25 inches in diameter. The exhaust port is
     approximately 1.75 inches in diameter, and has a short stub of a
     pipe protruding from it. I went to the auto parts store and bought
     a short (4 inch) length of straight exhaust pipe, and tapped it onto
     the stub of the exhaust pipe with a hammer. Once satisfied with
     the fit, I removed the extension pipe, smeared hi-temp Permatex
     RTV silicone on the outside of the stub, and tapped the extension
     back on again.
     
     I thought under the rear seat, all the way on the passenger side
     was the best place to mount the heater. Since I was unsure of
     the temperature of the outside housing during operation, I used a
     utility knife to remove the carpet and sound deadening padding
     from the area where the heater would be installed. I also had to
     cut one of the supports for the rear seat to make room for the
     heater. I fabricated a new bracket that cleared the heater, and
     tack-welded it to the floor. You may not have this problem on the
     Westy (Or is that Westie?) model. The seat would have probably
     been fine minus the one support for me, since I rarely if ever
     carried many passengers.
     
     I placed the heater in the location I wanted, with the intake
     towards the wall and the exhaust towards the center of the van.
     Used a pencil to mark the locations for  both the intake and
     exhaust, I used a hole saw to drill holes in the floor of the van.
     The holes were just slightly larger than the diameter of the intake
     and exhaust pipes. Took a wire brush to remove any loose crud
     around the holes I drilled, and placed the heater on the floor, and
     screwed it down, using the flanges on the housing. From the
     outside (underneath), I again used hi-temp RTV to seal the hole.
     I also used a wire-tie that had a screw mount to secure the intake
     hose to the frame. I turned in towards the center of the van, and
     placed the opening in a corner where two frame rails intersected
     to keep any possible spray out of the heater intake.
     
     The fuel was pretty sinple to set up. Since the gas heater has its
     own fuel pump, you will want to splice into the fuel line on the
     non-pressurized part. In other words, before the electric fuel
     pump for the injection. I went to a FLAPS and bought the OEM
     style braided fuel line, and used a plastic Tee fitting to hook it up.
     The fuel line entered the van through the near-vertical panel
     underneath the seat. I routed the line, and tied it securely to the
     existing fuel line to keep it from getting caught on any
     obstructions I might be driving over.
     
     Wiring was pretty easy as well. On the BN-2, only three wires
     need to be set up. Actually, there are usually more, but since I
     did not have the T-stat, it was simpler. I decided to manually turn
     off and on the heater as I saw nesc. The first wire was the main
     power feed to the heater.This was connected to the 12-GA red
     wire coming off the heater.  Since I had no idea of the amperage
     draw by this beast, I played it safe and ran a 10-GA wire from the
     battery posistive post to the connector on the heater. I used an
     in-line fuse holder with a 16-Amp fuse to protect in case of a
     short. Another wire was for a 12V positive signal to trip the relay
     to start the heater. This connected to a 16-GA red wire on the
     heater. Ther third was a ground, which connected to The battery
     Neg terminal, the switch and the ground (tan) wire coming out
     from the heater. I did manage to get the original power switch
     from the donor, and mounted it under the passenger seat. I
     drilled a hole in the side of the base, connected the wires, and
     pushed the shaft through. Tightened up the retaining collar,
     screwed on the knob and sat back to admire my handiwork. It
     was convenient enough for me when I wanted to turn on the
     heat. I would just bend over slightly, reach down to the base of
     the passenger seat and pull out on the knob. It would only take
     about 10 minutes to make the cabin temp too hot to stand.
     
     When I first started messing with the heater, it did not always
     start up properly. I assumed that it was the glow plug not getting
     hot enought to start the ignition process. Seems reasonable...
     especially since I had no documentation on the beast. So I rigged
     a relay system that would send a 12V current right to the post on
     the glow plug. I would turn on the heater switch, and wait for the
     sound of ignition. There is a safety (one of many) which shuts
     down the heater if ignition does not occur in one minute. If the
     heater did not start in about 20 seconds, I would press the button
     to add some extra current to the glow plug. POOF! Ignition
     always happened then! After about a month of the shock
     treatment, the glow plug failed. I bought another one at the dealer
     for $45, and installed it. I also messed with the fuel delivery
     adjustment, and got the heater to start on its own every time after
     that.
     
     I hope this helps anyone who is considering the installation. I was
     a bit nervous about having the heater on the inside of the van, for
     fear of fire....but the warmth soon lulled me into submission. Plus,
     that heater has so many safety devices on it that pretty much
     takes care of itself! When I sold the van a few years back to buy
     my Notchback, you had better beleive that I pulled that heater
     back out! You never know....If I convert my Westy from diesel to
     gas, I might want to install it again!
