   <h1>Trip report and Aux. Oil Cooler results (long)</h1>

   <pre>Hi folks,

We just returned from a wonderful week long bus trip through three Canadian
provinces. Our '71 Westy logged about 2300 miles on the tour from
Connecticut to New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and the southern coast
of Nova Scotia.  Now is definitely the time to visit--the weather is great
and the exchange rate is $1US to about $1.47CAN (which in practical terms
translates to incentive for a lobster dinner every night :). I retraced
segments of a longer tour I made of the area nearly 17 years ago (albeit
then in a GM van). The hiking trails in Fundy National Park were familiar
still and it appeared most of the larger rocks stayed where I had left them.
We encountered some of the harshest wind gusts I've ever driven through in a
bus on Prince Edward Island--having the canoe mounted over the poptop
probably didn't help matters much.  We did see a few baywindow buses along
the way, but there were an overwhelming number of Vanagon and Eurovan
Westfalias vacationing along the south shore in Nova Scotia and the Fundy
coast of New Brunswick. 

The day before our departure I planned to install an auxillary cooler since
on long 65mph highway runs laden with gear I was reaching 240 deg. F on the
oil temp gauge (with outdoor temps around 95 deg.--timing, valve adjustment,
carb, thermostat, flaps, tinware, etc., etc. were as they should be).
Earlier this summer at the Manassas show I bought an oil cooler adapter for
$5  that was a stock part on a watercooled Audi (I've since learned these
can be found on certain watercooled VW models as well).  It is made from
1/4" thick steel and accepts a standard doghouse type oil cooler using
standard cooler seals.  Two mounting points are provided as well as two 1/2"
fittings for inlet and outlet.  I recently switched my full flow lines from
the 3/8" type that came with the Berg kit to the 1/2" blue Aeroquip hose so
adding the second cooler was simply a matter of running extra hose.  I
mounted the cooler just ahead of the rear crossmember that the main heat
tube runs through and had to modify the adapter a bit with some cutting and
drilling to make a proper mount--I also felt it necessary to make an
additional support to keep the cooler more secure.  

The cooler only protrudes under the bus less than an inch lower than the
front transmission mount, so it gets airflow that it needs but it's not low
enough that I worry about it taking a hit. A Permacool oil thermostat was
not in stock at the FLAPS the day I made the installation, but it has been
ordered and will be added so the second cooler will only be in the oil
circuit when necessary.  Adding the cooler has lowered the oil temp between
20-25 degrees, so the highest I see on the oil temp gauge is now 220-225 on
a long, hot highway run, but most 90+ degree days around town I only see
190-200.  I'm happy with this improvement, but I plan to experiment a bit to
improve airflow to the cooler by mounting an air scoop ahead of it--just to
see if I can squeeze a few more degrees off the max. (might also mount a
plate to protect the cooler's belly).  The advantages of using this stock
cooler/adapter combo are its compact design, which means it can be mounted
under the van in an airflow area so there is no need for an electric fan and
of course, it is a stock part so seals and the cooler are can be
conveniently replaced when necessary, and at least in my case with a stock
1600, it has just enough surface area to bring the oil temp down to the
desired, comfortable level.

Getting back to the trip--we drove from CT straight up into New Brunswick
and across to Prince Edward, then down into Nova Scotia, visiting Truro,
Halifax and selected scenic towns along the south shore (Peggy's Cove,
Mahone Bay, Lunenburg, Shelburn).  As the vacation days ticked away, we
attempted to book the Yarmouth, NS to Bar Harbor, ME Ferry, but there were
no openings left for the days we needed.  We were however able to catch the
Digby, NS ferry to St. John, NB which saved us about 500 miles and allowed
us to enjoy more of Nova Scotia with the time we had.  With the canoe
mounted, clearance is about 8' 4", which wasn't a problem for the ferry that
day since they weren't using ramps and we shared the cargo area with
considerably taller 18 wheelers.  

The Border Issue: Our bus was not subjected to inspection on the Calais/St.
Stephen border crossing entering or leaving.  Before re-entering the U.S.,
we did speak with a waitress in St. Stephen who crosses the border regularly
to run errands and visit family members in Calais.  She noted that the
Calais/St. Stephen crossing is the 6th most heavily trafficked point of
entry on the Canada/U.S. border and even though she has a rapport with the
guards from her frequent crossings, they still randomly search her car a few
times a month, pulling door panels etc. while she watches nearby, then they
reassemble the interior and allow her to proceed.  She says "Oh c'mon guys,
you see me all the time!", but as she said to us, "they're just doing their
job and they always put things back the way they found them."  Nevertheless,
I'm glad they didn't decide to randomly check our van--the original birch
panel on the sliding door is super dry and would've shattered spectacularly
(using it to make a template for a fresh piece is on my ever reprioritized
"to do" list).</pre>
