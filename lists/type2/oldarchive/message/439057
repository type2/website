   <pre>HOW WE SPENT OUR SUMMER VACATION
By George, Marie, Claire, and Tempest
Part 3 of 4, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas

Edgemont, SD
Hot Springs, SD
We headed for Hot Springs on a whim and it turned out to be a lot of
fun.  We found a great place to stay (the Historic Log Cabin Motel), a
"auto camp" dating from the ^Ñ20s.  The proprietors have a small
menagerie of birds and animals that delighted the kids and stacks of
toys and bicycles that guests are welcome to use.  The deck affords a
great view of Hot Springs.  The big disappointment of Hot Springs is
that there really isn^Òt a _hot_ spring there.  There are several warm
springs though, and back before the turn of the century someone got the
idea of building a swimming pool around the springs and the result has
grown and is still in use to this day.  The Evans Plunge is kind of an
odd pool, with a gravel bottom (needed to allow the spring water to
enter the pool) and an edge that is four feet above the surface of the
water.  It is completely enclosed to allow use year-round.  Water
temperature is in the high 80s.  There are a couple of water slides
available, including one nasty one that simply drops you 20 feet and
sends you skittering across the water at what feels like Warp 9.  Yow! 
The girls were in hog heaven!  There were also traveling rings, various
floats, and even some large fiberglass alligators to play with.  None of
this stuff would be available in my home state, as the tort lawyers
would have sued the place out of existence.  Perhaps South Dakota (and
Wyoming, for that matter) has a hunting season for the taking of lawyers
or something!  Later on, Marie and the girls found an outfitter south of
town and took a horseback ride in the nearby hills.  We also visited the
city museum, housed in the original schoolhouse high on a hill.  North
of town, there is a reservoir (cold creek) that has camping and a nice
swimming beach.

Oelrichs, SD
Chadron, NE
Heading south on US385 into Nebraska, the land flattened out.  Really
flat.  No trees.  What^Òs that joke about the state tree of Nebraska
being the telephone pole?  South of Chadron, and just north of the
Niobrara river I saw a yard filled with familiar shapes.  About 20 or so
VWs of all descriptions filled a large yard next to a house.  Nobody
seemed to be home (darn!), so we moved on.  Just south of here we were
waved down by a highway worker who told us that they had just oiled the
road ahead.  He suggested that we take a handy dirt road for a few miles
to avoid the oil and gravel.  Having picked up too many gravel chips in
the windshield, I gratefully accepted his advice.

Alliance, NE
Letan, NE
Angora, NE
Northport, NE
Broadwater, NE
Lisco, NE
Oshkosh, NE
We switched to US26, and  followed the North Platte River for quite a
ways.  This is the route of the Oregon trail, and you can see why the
pioneers liked this route.  The land was flat, water and feed were
plentiful, and the direction of the river was pretty much the direction
that they wanted to go.  Most of these towns were little more than a
grain elevator and a few surrounding buildings.  Oshkosh was a bit
livelier, though.

Lewellan, NE
We wanted to stay here, and there was a nice little motel, but there
wasn^Òt anyplace to eat.  This seems to be a common occurrence in the
Midwest.  Almost every town has abandoned motels, restaurants, etc.  The
cause of this seems to be the increasing mechanization and consolidation
of farms.  There simply isn^Òt the need to have as many people on the
land, so there is a correspondingly lesser need for the services the
towns used to provide.  Unlike the Nevada ghost towns I^Òm familiar with,
this process didn^Òt take place rapidly, but over a number of years. 
Businesses just died as their clientele dried up.  The result is that
there might be a motel or restaurant hanging on here or there, but so
far apart that the traveler can^Òt find or patronize both.  It^Òs pretty
sad to see, but a fact of life if you follow the thin lines on the map.

Ogallala, NE
Found a place on the north end of town (away from the ever-present
railroad tracks) that was quite inexpensive.  It even had a much
welcomed pool!.  Most of the other guests were railroad workers doing
some sort of emergency track repair work.  We didn^Òt see much of them as
they had to leave for their job site at 3:30AM.  Talk about
Oh-Dark-Thirty!  From Ogallala we went south on NE61.</pre>
