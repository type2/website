        From Robert Fuhlghm's "All I ever really needed to know I learned
in Kindergarten". I highly reccomend this and all of Fuhlghm's books to
everyone.

RF>     "Jumper cables? You got jumper cables, buddy?"
RF>     "Yeah, sure, I got jumper cables."
RF>     English teacher and his nice sweet wife, from Nampa, Idaho (as it
RF> turned out). In their funny little foreign car. Drove around town
RF> with their lights on in the morning fog and left the lights on, and
RF> so forth and so on. Dead meat now. Need jumper cables. Need
RF> battery. Need Good Samaritan. Need a friendly hand from someone who
RF> looks like he knows what to do with jumper cables. And the Good
RF> Fairy of Fate placed them in my hands.
RF>     Men are supposed to know about jumper cables. It's supposed to be
RF> in the genetic code, right? But some of us men are mental mutants,
RF> and if it's under the hood of a car, well it's voodoo, Jack, and
RF> that's the end of it.
RF>     Besides, this guy only asked me if I HAD jumper cables. He didn't
RF> ask me if I knew how to USE them. I thought by the way he asked
RF> that he knew what he was doing. After all, he had an Idaho license
RF> plate and was wearing a baseball cap and cowboy boots. All THOSE
RF> kind of people know about jumper cables when they're born, don't
RF> they? Guess he thought a white-bearded old man wearing hiking boots
RF> and driving a 20 year old VW van was bound to use jumper cables a
RF> lot. So I get out my cables, and we swagger around being all macho
RF> and cool and talking automobile talk. We look under the hood of his
RF> rig, and there's no battery.
RF>     "Hell," I said, "There's your problem right there. Somebody stole
RF> your battery."
RF>     "Dang," he said.
RF>     "The battery is under the backseat," said his nice sweet wife.
RF>     "Oh."
RF>     So we took the luggage out of the backseat and hauled the seat out
RF> into the parking lot and, sure enough, there it was. A battery.
RF> Right there. Just asking for jumper cables to be laid on it. I
RF> began to get worried when the guy smirked at his wife and said
RF> under his breath that he took auto mechanics and sex education at
RF> the same time in high school and they had been confused in his mind
RF> ever since, when it came to where things were and what you did to
RF> get any action out of them. We laughed. His wife didn't laugh at
RF> all. She just pulled out a manual and started thumbing through it.
RF>     Anyway, the sum of our knowledge was that positive poles and
RF> negative poles were involved, and either one or both cars ought to
RF> be running, and 6-volt and 12-volt batteries and other-volt
RF> batteries did or did not work out. I thought he knew what he was
RF> doing and kind of went along with it. Guess he did the same. And we
RF> hooked it all up real tight and turned the ignition key in both
RF> cars at the same time. And there was this electrical arc between
RF> the cars that not only fried his ignition system, it welded the
RF> jumper cables to my battery and knocked the baseball cap off his
RF> head. The sound was like that of the world's largest fly hitting
RF> one of those electric killer screens. ZISH. Accompanied by an
RF> AWESOME blue flash and some smoke. Power is an amazing thing.
RF>     We just sat down right there in the backseat of his car, which was
RF> still sitting out there in the parking lot. Awed by what we had
RF> accomplished. And his wife went off with the manual to find some
RF> semi-intelligent help. We talked as coolly and wisely as we could
RF> in the face of circumstances. He said, "Ignorance and power and
RF> pride are a deadly mixture, you know."
RF>     "Sure are," I said. "like matches in the hands of a
RF> three-year-old. Or automobiles in the hands of a sixteen-year-old.
RF> Or faith in God in the mind of a saint or a maniac. Or a nuclear
RF> arsenal in the hands of a movie character. Or even jumper cables
RF> and batteries in the hands of fools." (We were trying to get
RF> something cosmic and serious out of our own invocation of power,
RF> you see. Humbled as we were.)
RF>     Sometime later I got present in the mail from Nampa, Idaho. From
RF> the guy's nice sweet wife. As a gesture of grace-forgiveness
RF> combined with instruction and admonition to go and sin no more.
RF> What she sent was a set of electronic true-start, foolproof,
RF> tangle-free jumper cables. Complete with instructions that tell you
RF> everything and more than you ever wanted to know about jumper
RF> cables, in English and Spanish. The set is designed so that when
RF> you get everything all hooked up, a little solid state switch
RF> control box tells you if you've done it right or not, before any
RF> juice flows. We could all use a device like that between us and
RF> power, I guess. It's nice to know that progress in such things is
RF> possible-in the face of ignorance and pride. Progress is possible.
RF>     Jumper cables? You want jumper cables? Sure I got jumper cables. I
RF> can hook you up to Grand Coulee Dam, buddy. Or wire you into
RF> Almighty God. Or whatever powers there be. AMEN!
