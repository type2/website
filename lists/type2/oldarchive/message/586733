   <br/>
   <pre>Hey now,
      It is now 7:45pm 20 August, we are headed for my sister's place in
Clovis, NM. We're on our way back from a side trip, a whopping 480 mile round
trip up to Taos. We went up to look at the Earthships-a self sufficent
housing alternative built out of materials most folks consider garbage. The
outer walls of the houses are made from used tires stacked like bricks and
rammed with dirt, and the inner walls are made from cement with tin cans in a
honeycomb fashion. The houses are designed to be self sufficent, using solar
power, a rain catching system for water, and a drainage system that uses
greywater to feed your very own garden. I really like the idea of living
independently of city utilities, and the whole environmental concept of these
structures. If this arouses your curiosity check out the links at
 <http://www.slip_dot_net/~ckent/earthship/hotlist.html>.
      So this morning we got up at 7am to take the drive up to Taos, finally
got on the road about 9am. Got to Taos at about 2:30, via a circuitous state
road through a scenic national forest. Beautiful, but slow. And we arrived at
the Solar Survival press office, and the entryway was plastered with signs
saying that it cost $5 for the tour, and there were nice brochures for us if
we didn't want to pay the $10 (5 each). I went inside and explained that the
$10 they wanted was our gas money to get home-we have absolutely no spare
cash. And the woman stopped smiling and said no dough no go. So we took a
little tour of our own, private road or not, as we were not going to dive 500
miles for nothing. Problem was, Sam needed to see the interior of a finished
house... Finally we decided to send Sam in with the $5 and I would wait in
the bus. 
     The tour consists of watching a how-to video, and a walk through of the
completed house. Sam said all she wanted to do was see the house, so the lady
said just go ahead, and keep the $5. Sam felt that she was kind of snotty
about it, and I would tend to agree, from my experience with her. We
definitly came away with a sour taste. It would seem that, in this case
anyway, making a fast ten spot was more important than the environmental
statement they are supposedly making. I understand that business is business,
but when you advertise your business as saving the planet, the almighty
dollar should run a close second to the original goal. Heck, some of us
stiffs actually PAY to help the environment-god forbid!  I still want to
build one of these puppies, I just want to do it while giving Solar Survival
as little cash as possible.
      Enough of my whining. Let me get you up to date. We stayed with Stuart
Habel and his girlfriend Kit (whoose last name I neglected to get) at their
place in Denver. They were wonderful company, and fed us like kings with
fresh goodies from the garden. Turns out that Stuart had ulterior
motives-there's a '78 westy in Texas he's got his eyes on, so I'll be paying
it a visit for him once we get home...  ;-) It was Stuart who provided us
with the information on the location of the Earthships at Taos, as they
intend to build one themselves. They showed us lots of pictures of a friends
that is under construction up in Colorado, and some blue prints and whatnot
that they had, so we really only needed to see the interior of a finished one
to really get a feel for the concept. Oh, and Indra chased thier unfortunate
cat up a tree, took several hours before the poor cat was down...  Indra only
wanted to play.  ;-)
      Upon taking our leave from Stuart and Kit, we stopped off at Vintage
Aircooled Motorwerks (that's how he spells it) in Denver, and spoke to Josh,
who it turns out had intended to go to Inuvik with the group. Unfortunately,
it didn't work out for him. We got the sender unit for the Oil Temp gauge,
and I showed off some of my Inuvik damage, including the busted right side
vent wing. Josh said he had that too, but I had no cash left. So he let me
take it on credit! Even helped pull it off the existing bus. Good guy, not
many folks give complete strangers credit at thier first meeting. Josh said
he specializes in used hard to find parts, especially older stuff. His web
page address is <http://www.diac_dot_com/~vintage>, look him up if you're in
need, he did me right...
      I installed the oil temp gauge at a rest stop south of Colorado
Springs, and of course changed the oil in the process. For the last several
hundred miles I've finally had a semi-accurate report card on all my engine
work, and I get good marks. Generally I stay around 180-200, and mountain
passes usually only drag me up to 230 or so. I'm pretty happy with those
numbers.
      After that we continued south to my sister's place in Clovis. Had some
pretty awesome lightining displays on the way down, as we scooted right in
between two big old angry thunderstorms. Pretty amazing stuff, and so close
that it looked like a camera flash hitting the entire horizon. I have to
admit it made me a little nervous there for a while.
     We got to Amanda and Mike's place (Amanda is my sis, Mike her husband)
about 11 pm, and they'd waited on dinner for us! Amanda made a great veggie
and pork thingamadoo, and we all had a good time. Last night I made Tofu
spaghetti, it came out pretty good. I usually make it with Ground Beef, but
Sam's friend Giselle corrupted her while she was in Los Angeles, and Sam's
back to being a Vegitarian again... I guess I'll have to sneak away for my
steaks now... ;-)
     And that brings us up to date. We plan to head home tomorrow evening, it
will be nice to get home. However, it also means back to the old grind. And
the first thing I have to do is take the spare engine out of the bus and get
it back in the bug where it belongs... Happy happy joy joy. So it all comes
down to this, one last long run-487 miles-and our odyssey is over. 
     It won't be our last.
Peace,
Eddie</pre>
