   <h1>trip report</h1>

   <pre>Hey, guys and gals.  I just got back from spending a week on the Alabama Riviera.  Gulf Shores State Park, right on the beach.  Great place!  Seven nights for $122.  Wal-mart right next door to the park.  In fact, in south Alabama there is a Wal-mart about every 10 miles.  It's becoming El Estado Mexicana de Alabama.  If I had just woken up in one, I'd swear it was in Mexico City.  I heard almost no English being spoken.  Not that I have anything against them.  The carpet industry would shut down without them.  And I had some great Mexican food in Montgomery. 

I was going to stay at a place under the bridge over the intra-coastal waterway called Southport Campground.  A little more convenient to town than the park.  I emailed them and they said they had partial hook-ups for $17/night.  I even confirmed it by phone.  But when I got there some Mexican guy was a real jerk.  He called some girl on the phone and told her that some guy was there wanting a partial in 'one of those old green vans' in an particularly snide tone.  In a few minutes he said they didn't have any openings until February.  When I pointed out that none of the partial hook-ups were being used, he made some lame excuse about them doing some electrical work and couldn't have anybody staying that long.  I was pissed to say the least.  Are there any attorneys on the list?  I sure would like to have some fun with that.

But the state park couldn't have been better.  And with the weekly discount, it's just a shade over $17/night anyway.  I got pretty good TV reception, they had great showers, and everyone was super nice.  I swear I sleep better in the bus than I do at home.  In fact, I caught up on a years worth of lost sleep.  That good, deep REM sleep.  Finished one book and got halfway through a 1000 page biography of George Patton.  Climbed all through the USS Alabama (battleship) , USS Drum (submarine) and they had lots of neat airplanes.  I'd never seen an SR-71 up close.  B-25, P-51, B-52, and lots more.  Found a great seafood place, Wintsel's Oyster House.  Happy hour, 4-7, oysters on the half shell $3/dozen.  And $1 draft Yeunglings.  I'd never had that before.  Nice medium-dark lager.  I tried to eat my weight in seafood.  Durn near did.  And the best shrimp I've ever had called Royal Reds.  They only catch them in Alabama, I was told.  2400 feet deep.  And they taste like those
 sweet Caribbean langostinos (lobsters with no claws).  They're my favorite.  Much sweeter tasting than Maine lobster.  

Met some interesting people.   One guy in a tent was from the upper peninsula of Michigan (a UPer).  Said his name was Neely.  He looked kind of like an old hippie. Or a white-headed George Carlin.   Come to find out, he's some kind of Indian and spends winters traveling to Florida and back on his bicycle.  Must get a check from the government.  But I had to admire him.  He said he makes 30 miles or so per day.  He stayed a couple days and split.  Another guy was in a Dodge van and he had a trailer with a Harley and bicycles in it.  He was 53 years old and had been retired for 5 years.  He went to work for a big concrete company somewhere in Iowa when he was 18.  So at 48 he took retirement with full benefits.  Some guys have all the luck.  He was going to stay through March and head back. He said one guy in a tent lived there for 2 years!  It was a nice place.

All in all it was a great trip.  Around 1500 miles, used 1 quart of oil, got around 20 MPG, tried to keep it right on 60 MPH (my favorite speed), saw lots of the coastal areas, ate, ate, ate, slept, slept, slept.  Only saw 2 VW's.  One 1995 Eurovan parked right next to my slot.  The couple were traveling around the country from BC.  They were headed to Houston next because that's the only place they could find anybody to work on it.  He said he was putting it up for sale as soon as he got home because it was an electrical nightmare.  He worked on it the whole time he was there and couldn't fix it.  Another couple had a 1990 Vanagon they'd just gotten restored by GoWesty.  They were very pleased with it.  I guess that would be a Waterboxer, wouldn't it?  Lots of people came by to admire mine.  Even the people at Wintsel's came out and  admired it.  Got lots of complements.  

Except for one minor glitch, the Bopmobile performed flawlessly.  I left yesterday morning and since it wasn't raining, I decided to come all the way home.  Instead of going through Birmingham, I decided to take a highway up through Talladega to cut some time off.  Turned out to be a nice six-lane highway and I made 60 MPH just like on the freeway.  Nice scenery.  Made it back to I-59 just north of Gadsden.  Then when I was about 40 miles from home, all of a sudden I had no accelerator pedal.  I was right by an exit and pulled off.  Nothing around there!  There was a house up the street that was all lit up.  I knocked on the door to ask where I might find a convenience store.    Somebody said, 'come in', so i did.  Turned out to be kids playing.  The mother came out looking alarmed and asked what i wanted.  I told her and then her husband came out.  He looked like one of those back-woods, back-door brothers from Deliverance!  (Come to think of it, I'm looking more and more
 like Ned Beatty myself).  He was really rude and told me that there wasn't a convenience store for 5 miles in either direction.  So I went back to the Bus and slept through the New Year coming in.  A while later somebody knocked.  Turned out to be a cop.  He wanted to know if I was alright and what the problem was.  I told him I thought I broke the accelerator cable and wanted to sleep until daylight to fix it.  He said that was fine but he'd gotten a report of some guy wandering around.   (Didn't think to ask him what law that would be violating).  I told him that wasn't me.  He did tell me that about a mile up the road there was a convenience store.  I thought about it later and figured that the rude couple, instead of offering to help, just called the cops on me.  I got up the next morning and put on some coffee.  20 or 30 cars passed, including a cop, and nobody stopped to offer any help.  Then a real nice guy stopped in a pickup and offered to do whatever it took to
 get me going.  He said he was going to hunt for a couple of hours and would come right back to help me if I didn't get it fixed.  I thanked him and then took everything out so I could get to the carburetor from the top.  The cable had snapped right at the connection.  I bent it around with a pair of pliers and took a piece of cord that I use to string up my ham radio antennas and tied it to the carb with a square knot.  It worked and it got me home.  Didn't have full acceleration but I could make 60 on the flats and 50 up hills.  Kept me over the 40 MPH minimum.  So now I've got to put a new cable on.  I'm not sure how long that cord is going to hold.</pre>
