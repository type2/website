   <h1>NQ's RMMW/Bandimere Trip Report Part 2</h1>
   <b>"No Quarter" <silent(-at-)beatricene.com></b><br/>
   <i>2001-08-15 21:49:18+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>As I was strapping the goods down to my roof rack, an RMMW rep came around
asking if anyone ran a shop.  I said I did (just a little one really) and
just like that I got signed up for the VIP tour of RMMW.  Rob had been
having trouble with his generator and dead batteries.  It was a broken wire
in the generator and so I insisted that it get replaced.  Just before and a
little after the VIP meeting, I went to work on replacing Rob's generator.
Did it without pulling the engine but it was still a tough job.  I missed
most of the show because of this but didn't want Rob to cruise around
without a charging system.  The VIP meeting was kind of neat.  I got to see
all the inner workings of RMMW.  Got to visit with Clyde Berg about his
newest design - a Berg pulley machined to look like a BRM rim.  I remembered
seeing that on the milling machine at Bergs but didn't know what it was.
Here is the picture I took:
http://www.buskatiers.com/2001/events/buskatierswayoutwest/updates/finalupda
tes/June8_Yacaipa/FridayGeneBerg3/images/MVC-020F.html

At the VIP raffle, I pulled out Dan's name from the hat and he won a $80
Hazet wrench set.  Of course everyone suspected that I cheated but honestly,
I had no idea whose card was whose.  For those that didn't have business
cards, they wrote their name on the back of an RMMW card.  Dee Berg needed
to borrow a pen and since Dan and I sat next to her and Clyde, she borrowed
my pen.  So now I have this pen set aside - Dee Berg herself wrote with my
Mead Lumber pen.  I never dreamed I'd be visiting with the Bergs.  Even
though they are very business-savvy, you would never know it.  Clyde and Dee
were both very personable.

After the meeting, I of course bee-lined it to Rob's SC and with help from
Justin and another fella who I've seen but can't remember (from NM I
believe), we got the generator replaced.  By this time, a little crowd had
formed around us and I was in a pissed-off and grumpy mood.  I was sore, I
cut myself a couple times, so I just wondered off back to my bus.  Terry and
Dan saved the day with Orange Gojo and water so I could get cleaned up.  Had
a really nice chat and jam session with Dan Buser behind my bus.  I got out
the guitar and some lyrics and we sung for a good 30 minutes it seemed.  It
helped break the tension that had welled up inside of me.  The show was over
by now and we were the last of the crowd left behind.  We finally piled into
our buses and headed towards 11 mile campground.  Our little caravan crept
up on Rick and Nikki and Rob blew by them for fun. Rick returned the favour
and then on the way up to the campgrounds, the opportunity presented itself
and I just passed everyone.  I was 3rd gear 45mph and just impatient as
could be - I wanted to get out of my bus, rest, eat, and just chill.

The campout was great at 11 mile.  Chad from Ponca City, OK was there.  He
was a good friend of Josh Rodgers and we had a nice little chat about T4
conversions and campouts.  A severe thunderstorm had formed over the
mountains and it appeared that it was coming our way.  It veered off just
leaving a few sprinkles on us.  It cooled way off and we were all watching
the rain descend on the far mountain slope to the point where you couldn't
see the mountain anymore.  As the storm made its way to the southeast, the
sun came out and we were treated to the most vibrant double rainbow you
could have ever hope to see.  The cameras were clicking and Dan got a couple
of nice shots of Rob's beautiful velvet green single cab and the Binz with
the rainbow in the background.  What a beautiful evening this was! As the
sun set, we got several group photos.  I can't wait to see these!  There was
also an awesome neon light looking sunset - a line between the mountians and
a cloud made a thin strip of sunlight come alive!!!   With Rick and Keith
running the grills, the food was abundant.  There was so much, I was full
and we had stuff left over!!!  Rich spent a bunch of his time working over
the high roof - getting the dome light to work, plugging vaccuum leaks, and
getting turn signals operational again.  He's amazing!  He just fixes stuff
on the fly and I don't have the patience to do this while I'm on vacation.
Rich is just the most determined bus dude I've ever met.

As night fell, we realized that in order to make Bandimere early, we would
have to get up at 5:00 and be on the road by 5:30.  It was really hard to
get up the next morning out of Rob's tent but the alarm went off so I got
Rob and Justin up.  Rob took off, expecting us to catch up with him later.
I woke up Jamie, Dan, and Rich and by 5:30, we rolled out.  The windows were
wet with dew and the morning air was a chilly 50 some degrees.  You could
see your breath!

We descended the slope into Woodland Park with Rich taking his highroof
around the corners.  He was doing an awesome job of handling the bus but you
could tell he had his hands full.   I had my hands full while I was trying
to navigate tight corners at speed with a heavy load.  When we finally hit
the gas station to fuel up, we sent Rich ahead of us because our flyer
trannies just simply were out-running Rich.  If Rich broke down, we could at
least see him and offer assistance.  The bullet ride from Colorado Spring to
Denver was something to behold.  Dan and I did 75 to 80mph and were in the
fast lane a lot of the time.  We actually had some kids in a VW Thing that
hung with us.  They knew something was up as you just don't see splitties
traveling those speeds! :-)  We had to slow down for a couple of big
antelope or deer that buzzed across the interstate as well.  As we hit our
exit, we saw Rich down on the shoulder just past the exit.  He had broken a
shift coupler - not snapped it in 2 mind you but right where the grub screw
goes.  We had to circle around and get back on I-25 and finally got to where
Rich was.  After about 20 minutes or so on the side of the road, Dan and
Rich got the coupler patched up enough so that Rich could shift again.  We
arrived at Bandimere and before long were in VW spectator parking.  It was
neat to have the high roof, the Binz, and my bus parked together.  A caravan
of "rare" buses of which mine was the least rare.  We wasted no time in
getting over the swap pile and we all found a few deals.  I didn't buy
anything but found a box labeled "free."  In it was a T2 1967 12v flasher
relay!  Dan scored a deal on some mint condition popouts (a whole set for
dirt cheap), and Jamie snagged a bunch of splitty jalousie windows as well.
We watched a little drag racing and I just kind of walked around and looked
at all the action.  I never made it as far north as I did last year but I
definitely saw more than I did at RMMW.  Rob's SC was the only Splitty SC
entered in the show!!!  There were a lot of DC's this year though.  Also,
when Rob and I came back from California, there was a couple that we passed
and then got passed by in a white Super Beetle VW around Hastings, NE.  It
just so happened those people found Rob's bus at the show and waited for him
to come back to his bus so they could meet him.  They were ecstatic to see
the bus that they had passed on the road back on June 14th - almost 2 months
prior.  Connections were made and hopefully we've added another Nebraska
couple to the Buskatiers!!!  I also met a guy from Scottsbluff, NE and
managed to give him my card.  Hopefully we can get more acquainted with our
Western Nebraska VWers as the population density is so sparse out there,
it's hard to find VW people.</pre>
