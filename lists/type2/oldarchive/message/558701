   <h1>A Trip around the country</h1>

   <br/>
   <pre>In 1988, just a few weeks after buying our 76 bus, my  wife and I took an 
extended bus romp from NC to the west coast and back, by way of just about 
everywhere in between. Chicago, Green Bay, Nebraska, Denver, Missoula, 
Seattle, SanFran, LA,  Grand Canyon, Albuquerque, Shreveport, N'orleans, and 
on to the gulf Coast of Florida, where we settled down. From early June, to 
mid September.  We took a three legged dog along. Lost him 3 times. On the 
first night after we left Durham, he honest to god chewed the knob off of the 
drivers side wing window, got it open, and managed to squeeze thru.Still 
don't know how he did that.  And he was an almost knee high sort of a collie 
of a mutt. We were spending that night at my Aunts, in Ashville,  and her 
husband did not want any dogs in the house, so Thumper had to spend the night 
in the bus-on a queen size mattress, with food and water close to hand. We 
had just adopted this dog, after finding him with a busted leg, and having 
spent 200 bucks getting him healthy again, you can imagine I wasn't very 
happy that he had taken a hike on me, and futzed my wing knob to boot.  Spent 
all the next day looking for him, called the pound, radio stations, etc. Five 
minutes after we gave up, well after dark, I hear this little moan, and there 
he is, outside the gate, whimpering his little lost doggie heart out. The 
rest of the week at my Aunts, I slept in the bus with him. After that, he 
didn't mind the few nights he had to spend alone in there. Second time, he 
chewed his leash and ran off for the afternoon while we were visiting my 
sister. On the grounds of a military rest home and VA hospital. Inside a 
large fence, so I wasn't too worried.
We lost him again on the Northern California coast, in a rest area, having 
left the window open too far, and after frantically searching all over, we 
were sadly faced with leaving without him when I noticed dog claw marks on 
the plastic bag full of dirty laundry stuffed under the front of the frame 
holding the mattress.  Now, we had spent over an hour in the hot sun looking 
for this mutt, and where was he? He had clawed his way under the bed, and was 
sound asleep in the cool darkness. After that, any time he seemed to be 
missing, we checked under the bed first.  Taking a dog along? GET A LEASH AND 
USE IT!!  A CHAIN LEASH!  THEY CHEW, YA KNOW!! Use it even in the bus if he's 
got a tendency to run, or hide, or go thru the windows.  Apart from that, he 
was a great companion, and a good watchmutt for the nights we slept in rest 
areas, or truck stop parking lots. Which are a lot cheaper than KOA.
    We took too many clothes. We shoulda brought lawn chairs, and an awning 
or an umbrella. We brought all of our camping stuff, but never actually 
camped at all, staying mostly with family and friends, or slept in the bus.  
Paper towels and 409 are a good idea, as is a tub of wet ones, and plastic 
sandwich bags to use as pooper scoopers. Lotta places real strict about puppy 
leaving his mark.. ..
A NEW Atlas helps, or trip tix from AAA or somesuch.They be constantly 
changing the roads... Couple of  water jugs, cause there is no water where 
your dog is dying of thirst. None. Trust me on this. A five gallon plastic 
bucket with a lid, like for sheetrock compound or latex paint, because he 
WILL get bored and chew thru the bag of dog food, and evenly distribute it 
around the bus in no time flat. And then refuse to eat it after you clean it 
up and put it back in the bag. A good hand broom and a dust pan are helpful. 
Plastic garbage bags are good for lots of things-wet clothes and swimwear, 
dirty laundry, dog poncho-you name it. 
A good suit of rain gear, or a decent poncho, and a wide brimmed waterproof 
hat.For you, not the mutt. This insures no rain. Leave home without it, and 
it'll rain alla time. Binoculars and a decent camera are good to have. And a 
decent tool kit. Not just automotive, but some general stuff too. Hammer, 
length of eletric cord, trouble light, small bush saw, folding shovel, spare 
jack, stuff like that. And spares..
Valve cover gaskets. NOBODY ON THE ROAD HAS VALVE COVER GASKETS. Ask me how I 
know. Spark plugs. Lotta FLAPS don't have plugs for busses.Or  air cleaners. 
Or oil filters.  Actually, lotta FLAPS don't have ANYTHING for busses. And 
sure as little green apples, that flap in Nowhere, Nevada aint got what you 
need when you need it on a Friday afternoon at 4:30.   An example...
 In '94 I had an alternator go from fine to fine particles in seconds, in the 
dark, in the middle of  Wheatpatch Kansas, during a round trip to Denver.  
Managed to limp into a truckstop, after cutting away what was left of my 
belt, and perused the idiot book over a cuppa joe. Figured I could make it to 
my College town of Hastings Nebraska [about 100 miles] if I waited till dawn 
to try. Made it. After trying the local VW dealer,[30 miles up the road] all 
the junkyards, and even a couple of vw enthusiasts, I found an auto electric 
shop run by a guy that barely remembered me, who, after making a few calls,  
informed me there wasn't a VW  bus alternator in the entire state.I already 
knew there wasn't one in the county. Had to have one air freighted in 
overnight. $165.00.  Just for the part and the shipping. I did all the work.  
"Spares" are a darn good idea.... 
We had a great time, lots of fun.   Next time we'll take our pop top camper, 
our bikes, and our canoe and a 12v cooler.. And stay gone longer.
