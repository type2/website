   <h1>Panamint trip report (finally!)</h1>

   <pre>Well, here it is.  Part of it was written at Panamint, on my dedicated
camper-komputer (Mac SE).

-David

Friday:
	Packed up floor jack, tools, firewood, semi-combustable computer
parts, clothes, bike.  Doesn't sound like a lot but it took me a good 3
hours.  Stopped by Wal Mart/Vons on the way out and picked up a Coleman
ice chest, ice, beer, and food.  This Vons was brand new, and HUGE.
They had one whole side of one refrigerated isle full of beer.  Of
course, all of the domestics and standard imports, plus about 30 more
kinds of imported beer, most of which I hadn't heard of, plus lots of
West Coast microbrews.  Inside one door was an array of beers sold by
the bottle - most 20-32oz with prices ranging from $3-$5 *each*.  Some
of them looked like they had been brewed in someone's basement, and the
labels printed out on a laser printer and attached with rubber cement.
But they had interesting names - Wheat, stout, guiness, etc.  I thought
about Al Knoll's mention of Raspberry brews at Panamint, and selected
two six packs and a couple of singles of raspberry-themed beer.  Yum!

	The drive was nothing special, I've driven this route many times
before.  Up Interstate 15, over Cajon pass (4100 ft), down into the
desert and up 395.  The skies were hazy when I left San Diego about
noon, but visibility was reduced to a mile, more or less, as I got close
to San Bernadino.  How could anyone bear to live here?  The smog was so
thick I was afraid my engine would choke and die, but of course it didn't. 
Crested the pass in third and coasted down the other side into the desert. 
The houses get cheaper and cheaper as you go out this way - and the
billboards larger and larger.  A few miles ago they were in the $120K
range, now the signs tell of $70K houses and extoll the virtues of
living in the clean air of the desert, only a few miles out of town
(yeah right!).  I stop at Adelanto, knowing from experience that this is
where the last cheap gas is.  Spent the extra 4 cents a gallon for mid
grade (I think I paid $1.13/gal) since I am gauge-less in Schneiter's
bus at the moment.  I also retarded the timing to 5 degrees after dead
center, just to make sure I wouldn't have any detonation.

As I approach Death Valley, the skies were crystal clear and it was getting
dark.  Driving up the 2-lane road, a Dodge Omni pulls out slowly to pass
me.  As he gets along side, we start up a gradual incline, and he slows
down.  "Oh great".  I think.  "He thought he wanted to pass me, and now
he doesn't have enough power.  What a bonehead!".  I glance at the car,
and notice that it looks a little "different" than the typical Omni.
Faded paint, yes... but the tires are wider, the wheels are shiny, and 
the trim is blacked out.  Right about the time I realize it's a GLH
turbo Omni (a respectably fast limited production car) the guy driving
nails it and zips out ahead of me.  All of a sudden I realize that it's
my friend Eric, whom I had invited to come out and visit with us.  Eric
is the one that brought Magnesium to the RedRock campout and showed us
how to burn it, much to the chagrin of the boy scout troop camped next
to us in their little tents.  I bet Eric was a boy scout once...
Anyway, Eric had recognized me, and after getting a sufficiently safe
distance in front of me, pulled onto the dirt shoulder of the road and
executed a perfect 180 degree E-brake turn.  Eric, you see, if a
professional dirt-oval racer with a garage wall covered with trophies.
Now I was really happy!  We set off to cover the last 30 or so miles to
Panamint together at a nice leisurely 55 mph.

We could see Panamint Springs resort from miles away in the darkness.
It wasn't very large, but any cluster of lights in this desolate area
was rare, and there were no others anywhere that I could see.  Eric and
I pulled in, and spotted two vans (An orange breadloaf and a Vanagon
Synchro).  We parked beside them, but there was nobody around.
Noticably absent was Martha's 81 Puke-ivory-eggnog Westy.  I knew she
and Bradley had set sail the day before, and I wondered why they weren't
here.  Eric and I sauntered over to the Restaurant (i.e. the only sign
of life) where we were flagged down by Jack Stafford, Steve Hoge, Kate,
and Norberto & Suzanna.  Of everyone there, the only person I knew from
previous campouts was Jack Stafford, and I'm embarassed to admit that I
didn't recognize him right away.  Part of the reason for that was that I
mistook his bus for the Kautz's, and was looking for them instead of
him.  Sorry about that Jack!  </pre>
