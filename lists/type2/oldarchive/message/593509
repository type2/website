What is all the talk about pancake shops anyway....

I've sort of indicated to Rob a few times but I will to the rest, I don't
think HIOP is much of a secret.  As I think David or somebody
mentioned it simply involves the right parts at the right tolerances.
I'm pretty sure the 2.0 I did that is in Steve's '80 has fair numbers
and I actually ended up using a crank towards the small end but
which did meet spec.  My '82 will maintain about 18 psi barely
idling when it gets REAL hot like 240F or so.  I think that is pretty
sufficient.  It does 40+psi when cold at revs.  The main things
that happen AFAIK are:

1: people use old used T4 oil pumps, this includes most of
the major rebuilders, certainly AVP when I last bought an engine
from them (which had poor hot oil pressure in general) and Mark
Stephens who used a worn POS in Steve's $3000 Stage 2 engine
(which had myriads of problems I once detailed.)  This is an
offensive thing folks as the T4 pumps new seem to have a ton
of backlash compared to the average "racing pump" and when
they wear you can't do anything for them except to polish the
intermediate plate and that is a real effort to do (I still do it when
I reuse a T4 pump.)  All this said the last 2 I put together I did
re-use the best of my 7-8 used pumps and I mixed and matched
parts to get the tightest tolerances I could.  You can look at various
used pumps and see the wear on the gears and predict how much
time the pump had on it, let alone watch backlash.  I hear good
things about the CB Perf T4 pump and it is only $45, and FWIW
if you check interferences carefully any short (flat cam) T1 style
pump should work.  The T4 pump is like 24-25mm gears, I don't
recall, so any 26mm gear pump is going to put out more than the
stocker.  The 30mm iron cased "Melling style" BP3034 should
BE AVOIDED at all costs as far as I'm concerned.  John has nice
pumps on aircooled_dot_net but they are a tad pricey (though they are
hard coated etc and perhaps worth it, but I've not seen regular OEM
pumps wear with clean oil so?)

2: there is a fallacy about the T4 case being bombproof and never
needing cut.  That was true "in the day" but the day was about 15
years ago folks.  If it has more than 2 builds on it or more than 200k
miles, or if you see a lot of fretting around the center main through
bolts, you better bet it isn't going to measure out if you put a good
dial bore gage down those mains.  It may be way out, just a hare,
or it may just be oval and out in one direction.  But they won't make
spec.  How much that matters, well I can't really say.  When I put
the AVP engine back together I didn't have the case cut, and I think
the main issue there was a too small crank and the oil pump, it
makes OK pressure now.  The one in the '82 the case didn't quite
make spec but I again had a nice unground crank.  Neither of these
was far off, the AVP case worse say spec is (2.756-2.7567) with
limit of 2.757 so it measured 2.7581+ or so on most of the mains in
some directions.  BUT you got a spec of 0.002-0.004 with limit of
0.007" on the bearing to crank interface so if you're 0.001 over on
the case but you use a crank that is near the high end of spec,
you still come out in the 0.005" or so clearance range with wear
to spare.  It's an extra step but you CAN plastigage the center main
and as it is likely the worst worn you SHOULD.  I lay the center mains
in dry, the cam bearings in dry, and plastigage all 3 cam bearings and
the center main with the crank and cam in dry.  If it don't make spec
you got to think about things, like having the mains cut.  In my
experience the cams are at the high end of wear or don't make it
either, a new cam may, but I've let them go if close.  One more area
that will begin to be a problem, lifter bores, they don't often still make
spec and there aren't OS lifters.  ALL THE NUMBERS YOU NEED
TO MEASURE ARE IN THE BUS BENTLEY (well except one you
don't really need regarding the rods.)

3: which of course brings us to crank and cam, again they got to
be spec or you need the crank ground or a new cam.  And again near
is OK as long as the case is tight, if it isn't you got issues.  The
Stephens crank was also small on the mains, a hare like 0.0006
or so under spec.  Steve's HIOP on that thing was REAL lousy from
the first day, that case is so big it is about worthless to me unless
I get it cut.  Stephens swore BTW they cut ALL their cases 0.020
and I think AVP actually does cut a lot of theirs 0.020 now days,
just if you didn't put it together you really don't know for sure.  That
is why you install that oil pressure gage, it is all you have to tell you.
Another thing I've thought about doing is using a waterboxer 10-12psi
oil pressure switch in an engine I don't want to fully instrument instead
of the 3-5psi POS that comes in an air cooled engine.  It would screw
right in and actually mean something if it goes off.  Rods aren't much
an issue, you are going to plastigage them for sure, if they don't work,
you can gripe about the crank if undersized or have the big ends
tightened up a little and live with your crank as long as they plastigage
out OK.  Small ends can be towards high end spec or even a hare over
a lot of racers run em big for better lubrication, but if you go too far
they can make noise.</pre>
