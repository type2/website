   <pre>I had a large response for this, 16+ replies so far.  Forgive me all you
others but this is easiest way to do it.  There is a note on a deep cycle
battery FAQ site at the very bottom too, maybe for Westies/solar folks.

>
>A good quality battery will cost between $50 and $100 U.S. and, if 
>properly maintained, it should give you an average of five years of 
>service.  The primary purpose of a car battery is to start the engine, 
>filter or stabilize the power, and provide extra power for the ignition, 
>lighting and other accessories when their combined load EXCEEDS the 
>capability of the charging system, i.e., when the engine is idling.  
>Secondarily, a car battery provides power to the electrical system when 
>the charging system is not operating.  
>
>A battery "ages" as the active plate material sheds (or flakes off) due 
>to the expansion and contraction that occurs during the discharge and 
>recharge cycles.  Deep discharges, heat and vibration accelerate this 
>"aging" process.  Eventually, the sediment builds up and the cell shorts 
>out or the active material in the plates can no longer sustain a discharge 
>current and the battery "dies".  In a hot climate, the harshest 
>environment for a battery, a recent survey of junk batteries revealed that 
>the AVERAGE life of a good qualify battery was 37 months, whereas, for a 
>poor quality battery, it was 23 months.   Slow cranking, especially on a 
>cold day, is another good indication that your battery is going bad and it 
>should be tested.
>
>Deeply discharged batteries almost always occur at the most inopportune 
>times, e.g., AFTER you have jump started your car, at the airport 
>returning home from a long trip, during bad weather, late at night in a 
>dark parking lot, or when you are late for an appointment.  You can easily 
>spend the cost of a new battery or more for an emergency jump start or 
>tow.  
>
>Most of the "defective" batteries returned to the manufacturer  are good.  
>This suggests that most SELLERS of new batteries do not know how to 
>properly test batteries. 
>
>
>3.  HOW DO I PERFORM PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE?
>
>Maintaining the correct electrolyte levels, tightening loose hold-down
>clamps and terminals, removing corrosion, and checking the alternator 
>belt tension is normally the ONLY preventative maintenance required for 
>a battery.  The preventive maintenance frequency is dependent upon climate 
>and battery type, but you should perform at least once before cold weather 
>starts and once a month in hot weather.
>
>If the electrolyte levels are low, add DISTILLED water to the level 
>indicated by the battery manufacturer or to 1/8" BELOW the bottom of the 
>filler tube (vent wells).  DO NOT OVERFILL, especially in hot climates!
>
>
>4.  HOW DO I TEST A BATTERY?
>
>The are four simple steps to test a car battery--inspection, remove 
>surface charge, state-of-charge test and load test.  To test a battery 
>(or to troubleshoot charging or electrical systems), you will need a 
>digital voltmeter with .5% or better accuracy.  A digital voltmeter can be 
>purchased at an electronics store and will cost between $20 and $200 U.S.  
>If you have a non-sealed battery, you will need a temperature compensating 
>hydrometer which can be purchased at an auto parts store for approximately 
>$5 U.S.       
>
>     A.  INSPECTION
>
>Visually inspect for obvious problems, e.g., loose alternator belt, low 
>electrolyte, corroded cable or terminal clamps, loose hold-down clamps or 
>cable terminals, or a damaged case.
>
>     B.  REMOVE SURFACE CHARGE
>
>If you have just recharged you battery or driven your car, eliminate any 
>surface charge by one of the following methods; otherwise, go to the next 
>step:
>
>          1.  Allow the battery to sit for two to three hours,
>
>          2.  Turn the headlights on high beam for five minutes and 
>                wait five minutes, or
>
>          3.  With a battery load tester, apply a load at one half the 
>                battery's CCA rating for 15 seconds and wait five minutes.
>
>     C.  STATE-OF-CHARGE TEST
>
>Using the following table, determine the battery's state-of-charge:  
>
>     Open Circuit          Approximate           Average Cell
>    Battery Voltage      State-of-charge       Specific Gravity
>
>         12.65                100%                  1.265
>
>         12.45                 75%                  1.225
>
>         12.24                 50%                  1.190
>
>         12.06                 25%                  1.155
>
>         11.89                  0%                  1.120
>
>[If the temperature of the electrolyte is below 70 degrees F (21.1 degrees 
>C), then add .012 volts (12 millivolts) per degree below 70 degrees F to 
>the reading.]
>
>Check both the specific gravity in each cell with a external hydrometer 
>AND the battery terminal voltage with a digital voltmeter without the 
>engine running.  For sealed batteries, measuring the battery's voltage 
>without the engine running with a digital voltmeter is the only way you 
>can determine the state-of-charge.  Some batteries have a built-in 
>hydrometer which only measures the state-of-charge in ONE of it's six 
>cells.  If the indicator is clear or light yellow, then the battery has a 
>low electrolyte level and should be refilled before proceeding, or if 
>sealed, the battery should be replaced.
>
>If the state-of-charge is BELOW 75% using either the specific gravity or 
>voltage test or the built-in hydrometer indicates "bad" (usually dark), 
>then the battery needs to be recharged BEFORE proceeding.  Replace the
>battery, if one or more of the following conditions occur:
>
>           1.  If there is a .050 or more difference in the specific 
>                 gravity reading between the highest and lowest cell, you 
>                 have a weak or dead cell(s), 
>
>           2.  If the battery will not recharge to a 75% or more 
>                 state-of-charge level or if the built-in hydrometer still 
>                 does not indicate "good" (usually green, which is 65% 
>                 state-of-charge or better), 
>
>           3.  If digital voltmeter indicates 0 volts, you have an open
>                 cell, or
>
>           4.  If the digital voltmeter indicates 10.45 to 10.65 volts, 
>                 you have a shorted cell.  [A shorted cell is caused by 
>                 plates touching, sediment build-up or "treeing" between 
>                 plates.
>
>     D.  LOAD TEST
>
>If the battery's state-of-charge is at 75% or higher or has a "good" 
>built-in hydrometer indication, then load test the battery by one of the 
>following methods:
>
>          1.  Turn the headlights on high beam for five minutes,  
>
>          2.  Disable the ignition and turn the engine over for 15 
>                seconds with the starter motor, 
>
>          3.  With a battery load tester, apply a load equal to one half
>                of the CCA rating of the battery for 15 seconds, or
>
>          4.  With a battery load tester, apply a load equal to one half 
>                the OEM cranking amp specification for 15 seconds.
>
>DURING the load test, the voltage on a good battery will NOT drop below 
>9.7 volts with the electrolyte at 80 degrees F (26.7 degrees C).  [If the 
>electrolyte is above 80 degrees F, add .1 volt for every 10 degrees  above 
>80 until you reach 100 degrees.  If below 80 degrees F, subtract .1 volt 
>for every 10 degrees until 40 degrees.]  After the load is removed, wait 
>five minutes and the battery should "bounce back" to the 50% 
>state-of-charge level or above.  If the battery drops below minimum test 
>voltage, does not bounce back, or will not start the engine, then you 
>should replace it.  If the battery passes this test, you should recharge 
>it to restore it to peak performance.
>
>
>5.  HOW DO I KNOW IF MY CHARGING SYSTEM IS OK?
>
>A car's charging system is composed of an alternator (or DC generator), a 
>voltage regulator, battery and indicator light or gauge.  While the engine 
>is running, it's purpose is to provide power for the car's electrical 
>load, e.g., ignition, lighting, accessories, etc., and to recharge the 
>car's battery.
>
>When the charging system fails, usually an indicator light will come on or 
>the gauge will not register "good".  The most common charging system 
>failure is a loose, worn or broken alternator belt, so check it first.  If 
>OK, then with a known good battery and the engine running at 2000 RPM or 
>more for two minutes, depending on the load and ambient temperature, the 
>voltage should increase to between 13.0 and 15.1 volts.  Most cars will 
>measure between 14.0 and 14.5 volts on a warm day.  [Most voltage 
>regulators are temperature compensated to properly charge the battery 
>under different environmental conditions.  As the ambient temperature 
>decreases, the charging voltage is increased to overcome the higher 
>battery resistance.  Conversely,  as the ambient temperature increases, 
>the charging voltage is reduced.  Other factors affecting the charging 
>voltage are the battery's condition, state-of-charge, electrical load and 
>electrolyte level and purity.]  
>
>If terminal voltage is below 13.0 volts and the battery tests good after 
>being externally recharged or if you are still having problems keeping it 
>charged, then have the charging system's output voltage and current and 
>car's parasitic (key off) load tested.  A loose alternator belt or bad 
>diode will significantly reduce the alternator's current output.  
>
>If output voltage is above 15.1 volts with the ambient temperature above 
>freezing, the battery's electrolyte level is frequently low, or you smell 
>"rotten eggs" around the battery, then you are probably overcharging the 
>battery and the charging system should be tested.    
>
>
>6.  HOW DO I JUMP START MY CAR?
>
>In cold weather, a good quality booster cable with four to six gauge wire
>is necessary to provide enough current to the disabled car to start the
>engine.  [The smaller the wire gauge number, i.e., the larger the wire
>diameter, the better.]  Please check the owner's manual for BOTH vehicles
>BEFORE attempting to jump start and follow the manufacturer's procedure
>because some cars should not be running during a jump start.  However,
>starting the disabled car with the good car running can prevent having 
>two disabled.  DO NOT allow the booster cable clamps touch each other or 
>the POSITIVE clamp to touch the frame or engine block. 
>
>     A.  If BELOW freezing, determine that the electrolyte is NOT frozen 
>in the dead battery.  If frozen, allow to thaw BEFORE proceeding.  A 
>discharged battery, i.e., battery voltage or 12.0 volts or less or 
>specific gravity of 1.140 or less, will freeze at approximately 8 
>degrees F (-15 degrees C).
>
>     B.  Without the cars touching, turn off all unnecessary accessories 
>and lights on BOTH cars and insure there is plenty of ventilation.
>
>     C.  Start the car with the good battery and let it run for at least
>two or three minutes at fast idle to recharge it's battery BEFORE 
>proceeding.
>
>     D.  Connect the POSITIVE booster cable clamp (usually RED) to the
>POSITIVE terminal on the dead battery.  Connect the POSITIVE booster 
>cable clamp on the other end of the booster cable to the POSITIVE terminal 
>on the good battery.
>
>     E.  Connect the NEGATIVE booster cable clamp (usually BLACK) to the
>NEGITIVE terminal on the good battery and the NEGATIVE booster cable clamp
>on the other end to a clean, unpainted area on the engine block or frame 
>on the disabled car AWAY from the battery.
>
>     F.  Let the good car to continue to run at high idle for five minutes 
>OR MORE to allow the dead battery to receive some recharge and to warm 
>it's electrolyte.
>
>     G.  Start the disabled car and allow to run at high idle.  If the car
>does not start the first time, recheck the connections, wait a few minutes
>and try again.
>
>     H.  Disconnect the booster cables in the REVERSE order, starting with 
>the NEGITIVE clamp on the block or frame of the disabled car to minimize 
>the possibility of an explosion.
>
>     I.  As soon as possible, fully recharge and test the dead battery 
>for latent or permanent damage as a result of the deep discharge.
>
>
>7.  WHAT DO I LOOK FOR IN BUYING A NEW BATTERY?
>
>Battery buying strategy for use in Canada, for example, is different than 
>hot climates that you find in Texas.  In the colder climates, higher CCA
>ratings are more important; whereas, in a hot climate, a higher RC ratings
>are more important once the CCA rating has satisfied the OEM cranking amp
>requirement.
>
>     A.  Cold Cranking Amps (CCA)
>
>The most important consideration is sizing the battery's CCA rating to
>MEET OR EXCEED, depending on the climate, the car's OEM cranking
>requirement.  [CCAs are the discharge load measured in amps that a fully
>charged battery at 0 degrees F (-17.8 degrees C) can deliver for 30 
>seconds and while maintaining the voltage above 7.2 volts.  Batteries are 
>sometimes advertised by their Cranking Performance Amps (CA) or Marine 
>Cranking Amps (MCA) measured at 32 degrees F (0 degrees C) or Hot Cranking 
>Amps (HCA) measured at 80 degrees F (26.7 degrees C), which are not the 
>same as CCA.  Do not be mislead by CA, MCA or HCA ratings.  To convert CAs 
>to CCAs, multiply the CAs by .8.  To convert HCAs to CCAs, multiply HCAs 
>by .69.]

>degrees F (26.7 degrees C) can be discharged at 25 amps until the voltage 
>falls below 10.5 volts.]  More RC is better in every case!  In a hot  
>climate, for example, if your car has a 360 OEM cranking amp requirement, 
>then a 400 CCA rated battery with 120 minute RC with more electrolyte 
>would be more desirable than one with 1000 CCA with 90 minutes of RC.  
>
>[If more RC is required, two six volt batteries can be connected in series 
>or two (or more) 12 volt batteries can be connected in parallel.  Within a 
>BCI group size, generally the battery with larger RC will weigh more 
>because it contains more lead.]
>
>     C.  Type
>
>The two most common types of CAR batteries are low maintenance 
>(non-sealed) and maintenance free (non-sealed or sealed).  [The low 
>maintenance batteries have a lead-antimony/calcium (dual alloy or hybrid) 
>plate formulation; whereas, the maintenance free batteries have a 
>lead-calcium/calcium formulation.]  The advantages of maintenance free 
>batteries are less preventative maintenance, longer life, faster 
>recharging, greater overcharge resistance, reduced terminal corrosion and 
>longer shelf life, but are more prone to deep discharge (dead battery) 
>failures. In hot climates, buying non-sealed batteries is recommended 
>because a sealed battery will NOT allow you to add water when required or 
>to test the specific gravity with an external hydrometer.   
>
>Some manufacturers introduced a third type of car battery, "dual", that 
>combined a standard battery with switchable emergency backup cells.  For 
>about the same cost a better approach was to buy two batteries and isolate 
>them.
>
>For off road applications in trucks, recreational vehicles (RVs), 4x4s, 
>vans or sport utility vehicles, some manufacturer's distribute "high 
>vibration" or RV battery versions designed to reduce the effects of 
>moderate vibration.  For excessive vibration applications, it is best to 
>buy a commercial battery.
>
>Car batteries are specially designed for high initial cranking amps
>(usually for five to 15 seconds) to start an engine; whereas, deep cycle 
>(or marine) batteries are designed for prolonged discharges at lower 
>amperage.  A "dual marine" battery is a compromise between a car and deep 
>cycle battery;  however, a CAR battery will give you the best performance 
>in a CAR.  For RVs, a car battery is used to start the engine and a deep 
>cycle battery is used to power the accessories.  [The batteries are 
>connected to a diode isolator and both are automatically recharged by the 
>RV's charging system when engine is running.  For additional information 
>on multi-battery applications, call (800) 845-6269 or (503) 692-5360 and 
>request a free copy of "Introduction to Batteries and Charging Systems" by 
>Ralph Scheidler.]
>
>     D.  Size
>
>Manufacturers build their batteries to an internationally adopted Battery 
>Council International (BCI) group number (24, 26, 70, 75, etc.) 
>specification, [which is based on the physical case size, terminal 
>placement and terminal polarity.]  The OEM battery group number is a good 
>starting place to determine the replacement group.  Within a group, the 
>CCA and RC ratings, warranty and battery type will vary in models of the 
>same brand or from brand to brand.  Batteries are generally sold by model, 
>so the group numbers will vary for the same price.  This means that for 
>the SAME price you can potentially buy a physically larger battery with 
>more RC than the battery you are replacing, e.g. a 34/78 group might 
>replace a smaller 26/70 group and give you an additional 30 minutes of RC.  
>If you do this, be sure that the replacement battery will fit, the cables 
>will connect to the correct terminals, and that the terminals will NOT 
>touch the hood when closed.
>
>BCI and the battery manufacturers publish application guides that will 
>contain the OEM cranking amperage requirements and group number 
>replacement recommendations by make, model and year of car, and battery 
>size, CCA and RC specifications.  Manufacturers might not build or the 
>store might not carry all the BCI group numbers.  To reduce inventory 
>costs, dual terminal "universal" batteries that will replace several group 
>sizes are becoming more popular and fit 75% or more of cars on the road 
>today.  
>
>Battery manufacturers or distributors will often "private label" their 
>batteries for large chain stores.  Below is a list of the largest domestic 
>battery manufacturers/distributors in North America and my understanding

>     E.  Freshness
>
>Determining the "freshness" of a battery is sometimes difficult.  NEVER 
>buy a battery that is MORE than SIX months old because it is starting to
>sulfate.  [Sulfation occurs when lead sulfate can not be converted back to 
>charged material and is created when discharged batteries stand for a long 
>time or from excessive water loss.]  The date of manufacture is stamped on 
>the case or printed on a sticker.  It is usually a combination of alpha 
>and numeric characters with letters for the months starting with "A" for 
>January (skipping "I") and digit for the year, e.g., "J6" for September, 
>1996.  Like bread, fresher is definitely better.
>
>     F.  Warranty
>
>As with tire warranties, battery warranties are NOT necessarily indicative 
>of the quality or cost over the life of the car.  Most manufacturers will
>prorate warranties based on the LIST price of the bad and replacement 
>battery, so if a battery failed half way or more through its warranty 
>period, buying a NEW battery outright might cost you less than paying the 
>difference under a prorated warranty.  The exception to this is the free 
>replacement warranty period.  This represents the risk that the 
>manufacturer is willing to assume.  A longer free replacement warranty 
>period is better and is usually an indication of the quality of the 
>battery.
>
>
>8.  HOW DO I INSTALL A BATTERY?
>
>A car battery weights between 30 and 60 pounds, so the first question is
>do I want to  install it myself?  The second question is what do I do with 
>the old battery if not exchanged for the new one?
>
>     A.  Thoroughly wash and clean the old battery, battery terminals and
>case or tray with water to minimize problems from acid or corrosion.  
>Heavy corrosion can be neutralized with a mixture of baking soda and 
>water.  Also, mark the cables so you do not forget which one it is which 
>when you reconnect.
>
>     B.  Remove the NEGATIVE cable first because this will minimize the
>possibility of shorting the battery  when you remove the other cable.  
>Next remove the POSITIVE cable and then the hold-down bracket or clamp.  
>If the hold down bracket is severely corroded, replace it.  Dispose the 
>old battery by exchanging it when you buy your new one or by taking it to 
>a recycling center.  Please remember that batteries contain large amounts 
>of harmful lead and acid.  
>
>     C.  After removing the old battery, be sure that the battery tray 
>and cable terminals or connectors are clean.  Auto parts stores sell a 
>cheap wire brush that will allow you to clean the inside of a terminal 
>clamps and the terminals.  If the terminals, cables or hold down brackets 
>are severely corroded, replace them.  Corroded terminals or cables will 
>significantly reduce starting capability.
>
>     D.  Thinly coat the terminal and terminal clamps with a high 
>temperature grease or petroleum jelly (Vaseline) to prevent corrosion.
>
>     E.  Place the replacement battery so that the NEGATIVE cable will
>connect to the NEGATIVE terminal.  Reversing the polarity of the 
>electrical system will severely damage or DESTROY it.  
>
>     F.  After replacing the hold-down bracket, reconnect the cables in 
>reverse order, i.e., attach the POSITIVE cable first and then the NEGATIVE 
>cable last.  
>
>     G.  Before starting the engine, check the electrolyte levels and
>state-of-charge.  Refill or recharge as required.  
>
> [If you want to retain your car's computer memory, security codes or radio
>settings, a second battery can be temporarily connected to the electrical
>system in parallel before disconnecting the first one.  A cigarette 
>lighter plug can used to easily connect a parallel battery.]
>
>
>9.  HOW DO I RECHARGE MY BATTERY?
>
>In addition to the earlier cautions, some more words of caution:  
>
>     A.  NEVER, NEVER disconnect a battery cable from car with the engine
>running because the battery acts like a filter for the electrical system.
>Unfiltered [pulsating DC] electricity can damage expensive electrical
>components, e.g., computer, radio, charging system, etc.
>
>     B.  Check the electrolyte level and be sure it is not frozen BEFORE 
>recharging.  
>
>     C.  Do NOT add water if the electrolyte is covering the top of the 
>plates because during the recharging process, it will warm up and expand.  
>After recharging has been completed, RECHECK the level. 
>
>     D.  Reinstall the vent caps BEFORE recharging and recharge ONLY in 
>well ventilated areas.  NO smoking, sparks or open flames because while
>the battery is being recharged because they give off explosive gasses.  
>
>     E.  If your battery is sealed, do NOT recharge with current ABOVE 25 
>amps.
>
>     F.  Follow the charger manufacturer's procedures for connecting and 
>disconnecting cables and operation to minimize the possibility of an 
>explosion, but generally you should turn the charger OFF before connecting 
>or disconnecting cables to a battery.
>
>     G.  If a battery becomes hot, or if violent gassing or spewing of 
>electrolyte occurs, turn the charger off temporarily or reduce the 
>charging rate.
>
>     H.  Insure that in car charging with an external charger will not 
>damage the car's electrical system with high voltages.  If this is even a 
>remote possibility, then disconnect the car's negative battery cable from 
>the battery BEFORE connecting the charger.
>
>Usually, a when car is jump started, it is run to recharge (or equalize) 
>the battery. This might NOT fully charge it!  The length of time to fully
>recharge the battery depends on the amount of discharge, the amount of
>surplus current that is diverted to the battery, how long the engine is
>run, RPM, and temperature.  That is, an alternator is sized by the car
>manufacturer to carry the maximum accessory load and maintain a battery--
>NOT recharge a dead one.  
>
>[For example, if 300 amps are consumed for ten seconds to start a car from 
>a fully charged battery, it will take the charging system approximately 
>two and one half  minutes to replace the power used if 25 amps are 
>available to the battery, or six minutes at ten amps, and an hour at one 
>amp.  Using the same example with a dead 120 minute RC battery, it would 
>take approximately 86 times longer to recharge it or three and one half 
>hours at 25 amps, 8.7 hours at 10 amps or 86.4 hours at one amp].
> 
>If you have added lights, audio amplifiers, alarms, cellular telephones or 
>other accessories, and "stop-and-go drive occurs frequently, the 
>alternator might NOT produce enough current to keep your battery fully 
>charged.  You might need to increase the capacity of the charging system.  
>[Ideally the combined load of all the lights,  fans, and accessories 
>should be less than 75% of the charging system's maximum output, so that 
>at least 25% is available to recharge the battery.] 
>
>A better method to recharge batteries is to use an external constant
>current charger which is set not to deliver more than 12% of the RC rating
>of the battery and monitor the state-of-charge.  For fully discharged 
>batteries, the following table, published by BCI, lists the recommended 
>battery charging rates and times:
>
>    Reserve Capacity         Slow Charge           Fast Charge
>      (RC) Rating 
>
>  80 Minutes or less      15 Hours _at_ 3 amps     2.5 Hours _at_ 20 amps
>
>  80 to 125 Minutes       21 Hours _at_ 4 amps    3.75 Hours _at_ 20 amps
>
>  125 to 170 Minutes      22 Hours _at_ 5 amps      5 Hours _at_ 20 amps
>
>  170 to 250 Minutes      23 Hours _at_ 6 amps     7.5 Hours _at_ 20 amps
>
>  Above 250 Minutes       24 Hours _at_ 10 amps     6 Hours _at_ 40 amps
>    
>The BEST method is to SLOWLY recharge it using an external constant
>voltage (or tapered current charger) because the electrolyte has more time
>to penetrate the plates.  A constant voltage "automatic" charger applies
>regulated voltage at approximately 14.4 volts.  A 10 amp automatic charger
>will cost between $30 and $60 U.S. at an auto parts store.  [To prevent
>damage to a fully discharged battery, the current should be less than 1%
>of the CCA rating during the first 30 minutes.]  With a taper charger, a
>high current, up to 30 amps, can be applied to non-sealed batteries for a
>short period up to 30 minutes maximum and then is regulated downward until
>the charge state reaches 100%.  
>
>[An excellent automatic constant voltage battery charger is a 15 volt 
>regulated power supply adjusted to 14.4 volts at 80 degrees F (26.7 
>degrees C).  If 32 degrees F (0 degrees C), then increase the charging 
>voltage to 15.3 volts.  When charging a maintenance free battery, add .2 
>volts.]
>
>If left unattended, a cheap, unregulated trickle battery chargers can
>overcharge your battery because they can "boil off" the electrolyte.  Do
>NOT use fast, high rate, or boost chargers on any battery that is sulfated
>or deeply discharged.  This condition requires a constant current from one
>to two amps for 60 to 120 hours.  The electrolyte should NEVER bubble
>violently while recharging because high currents only create heat and
>excess explosive gasses.
>
>
>10.  WHAT IS PARASITIC LOAD?
>
>Parasitic (key off) is the cumulative load produced by electrical devices, 
>e.g., clocks, computers, alarms, etc., that operate after the engine is 
>stopped.  Parasitic loads typically run 20 to 120 milliamps.  To test the 
>parasitic load an amp meter must be inserted in series with either the 
>positive or negative battery terminal and it's cable without the engine 
>running.  If the parasitic load is prematurely discharging your battery, 
>start removing fuses one-at-a-time until the offending electrical 
>component is identified.  Leaving your headlights on will generally 
>discharge a fully charged battery (with 90 minutes of RC) in four to six 
>hours.
> 
>
>11.  CAN I INCREASE THE LIFE OF MY BATTERY?
>
>     A.  Keeping your battery and engine well maintained is the BEST way 
>to extend the life of your battery.  
>
>For cold climates, keeping the battery fully charged and the engine warm 
>will help increase the life of the battery.  In the warmer climates and 
>during the summer, the electrolyte levels need to be checked more 
>frequently and DISTILLED water added, if required.  This is due to the 
>high underhood temperatures.  In a study conducted by the Society of 
>Automotive Engineers (SAE), the underhood temperature have increased 30% 
>since 1985.  Heat shields are becoming more popular and are being used by 
>a number of car manufacturers to protect the batteries from the high 
>underhood temperatures.  Some battery manufacturers build "hot climate" 
>versions by increasing the amount of electrolyte in the battery to provide 
>more "cooling" or by special plate formulations.  Batteries last 
>approximately two thirds as long in hot climates as cold ones.  
>
>     B.  Add distilled water--NEVER add acid or tap water and DO NOT 
>OVERFILL. 
>
>     C.  Turning off unnecessary accessories and lights BEFORE starting 
>your car will decrease the load on the battery while cranking, especially 
>when it is cold.  
>
>     D.  Leaving your lights or other accessories on and fully 
>discharging the battery can ruin your car battery, especially if it is 
>maintenance free.  If this should this occur, you should test the battery 
>AFTER it has been fully recharged to determine if there is any latent or 
>permanent damage.
>
>     E.  Reduce the parasitic (key-off) load to 120 milliamps or less.  
>
>     F.  Storing batteries in cool locations and periodically recharging 
>them.
>
>     G.  In cold climates, increasing the diameter (smaller wire gauge) of 
>the battery cables will increase the power available to the starter motor.
>
>
>12.  WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON CAUSES OF PREMATURE BATTERY FAILURES?
>
>     A.  Loss of electrolyte (which account for over 50% of the failures) 
>due to underhood heat or overcharging,
>
>     B.  Deep discharges (leaving your lights on),
>
>     C.  Misapplication or using an undersized battery,
>
>     D.  Undercharging or loose alternator belt,
>
>     E.  Excessive vibration (due to a loose holdown clamp),
>
>     F.  Using tap water,
>
>     G.  Corrosion, and
>
>     H.  Freezing.
>
>
>13.  WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MYTHS ABOUT BATTERIES?
>
>     A.  Storing a battery on a concrete floor will discharge them.
>
>Modern lead acid battery cases are better sealed, so external leakage 
>causing discharge is no longer a problem.  [Temperature stratification 
>within large batteries can accelerate the internal "leakage" or self 
>discharge if the battery is sitting on an extremely cold floor in a warm 
>room or installed in a submarine.]
>
>     B.  Driving a car will fully recharge a battery.  
>
>There are a number of factors affecting alternator's ability to charge 
>a battery.  The greatest factors are how much current from the alternator 
>is diverted to the battery to charge it, how long the current is available 
>and temperature.  Generally, running the engine at idle or short 
>"stop-and go trips" during bad weather at night will not recharge the 
>battery.  
>
>     C.  A battery will not explode.  
>
>While spark retarding vent caps help, recharging, a battery produces 
>hydrogen and oxygen gasses.  If  a spark occurs, an explosion can occur.  
>Remember the "Hindenburg"!
>
>     D.  A battery will not lose it's charge sitting in storage.  
>
>A battery has self discharge or internal electrochemical "leakage" that 
>will cause it to become fully discharged and sulfated over time.  Prior to 
>storing a battery, it should be fully charged,  placed in a cool location 
>above freezing, and recharged when it reaches the 50% state-of-charge 
>level or once every six months, whichever occurs first.  If left in a car 
>or RV, disconnect the negative cable.  
>
>     E.  Maintenance free batteries never requires electrolyte.  
>
>In hot climates, the electrolyte could be "boiled off" due to the high
>underhood temperatures .  Electrolyte could also be lost due to excessive 
>charging voltage or charging currents.
>
>     F.  Test the alternator by disconnecting the battery with the engine
>running.
>
>A battery as like a voltage stabilizer or filter to the pulsating DC 
>produced by the alternator.  Disconnecting a battery while the engine is 
>running can destroy the electronic components, e.g., computers, radio, 
>stereo, alarm system, etc., or the charging system.  Just say NO! if 
>anyone suggests this.
