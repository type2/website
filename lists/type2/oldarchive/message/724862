Hi Martha:
I've been in the CCC list for the last couple of months, hoping to some
day, when you guys decided to camp on the very north side of California,
I could join you. (I live in Eugene, OR.) The group sounds like fun, and
share two of my biggest hobbies, camping and VW's. However, reading
about your views about the plastic burning issue made me change my mind.
Without even considering the scientific data that puts plastic burning
as a bad idea for the environment, consider the following: If there is
even a small doubt that burning plastics in a campground will pollute
the environment and create unwanted odors, why do it? It can be THAT
much fun... I don't think I would enjoy being part of a group that
allows such irresponsible acts to happen, just for the fun(?) of it.
Sincerely,
Cris.</pre>
