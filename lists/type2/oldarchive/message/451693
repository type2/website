   <h1>Recent Journey - kinda long</h1>

   <br/>
   <pre>Well,  I finally found and purchased a high roof camper.  It is a '76 
and I like it a lot.  I had quite an adventure bringing it home and 
thought I would share it.

I saw an ad for a high roof on the samba.  Worked out the details and 
bought a one-way ticket from Denver, Colorado to Oakland, California 
where the bus was living.  The bus looked good, was a little loud from 
an exhaust leak but I didn't have any concerns about driving it the 
1200 miles home.  I would like to say that it went off without a hitch 
but I was taught not to lie so it would be a problem.

By the time I was past Sacramento the bus was dropping a pretty big 
puddle of oil at every stop.  It seemed weird because the bus ran very 
well.  So while at a rest area I poked around a bit.  I found that the 
aftermarket oil coolers had some loose clamps and some oil was getting 
by.  I managed to get them tightened up and things looked like they 
were improving.  A side note:  Part of what complicated my adventure 
was that I had no tools with me.  All I had was a stubby screwdriver 
with interchanging bits and my leatherman micra.  I thought about 
bringing some tools but it seemed like a big hassle given airport 
security and what not.  I brought what I had by accident and ended up 
having to check a bag to bring them.   So, back to the adventure.

I got into Reno, Nevada and noticed my tail lights were out.  Took them 
apart at the gas station and cleaned up some contacts and they were 
working again.  I stopped for the night just outside of Reno and slept 
in my high roof for the first time.  The next morning it was clear and 
bright, I had slept much longer than expected but I guess I needed it.  
I stopped for gas in Winnemucca just after lunch time and had a 
sandwich.  All was going well but the gas shut off didn't and I had 
some gas leaking on both sides.  I let this subside and cleaned up.  I 
came back from the restroom having degreased myself for the 10th time 
and jumped in to get back on the road.  I turned the key and nothing, 
zip, nada.  Seemed like I had plenty of electricity so I crawled under 
the car to take a look at the starter.  The PO told me he had just 
replaced the starter and it looked clean/new.  My stubby screwdriver 
was just long enough to short the terminals and it was alive!  I turned 
it off and then started it with the key.  Made sure I parked on a hill 
from then on.

Things went well until I was leaving Salt Lake, Utah.  I was about 20 
miles from Evanstan, Wyoming when the alternator light came on.  Oh 
well, I thought.  Good thing I have that type IV motor so I can just 
run the lights off the battery and fix it in Evanstan.  The PO had an 
extra belt but as I said I had no tools.  I got about 5 miles  from 
Evanstan when I remembered that fuel injected cars need more 
electricity to run.  My lights were dim and I was waiting for the 
engine to misfire.  I drafted in behind a semi (Thanks Watkins Truck 
lines :) and made it into Evanstan.  The bus died half a  block from 
the gas station and I coasted in.

I checked the belt and it had come off, not broken.  I looked around 
but didn't see anything open (It was after midnight) so I called upon 
the gods of improvisation.  I was able to get the belt about a third of 
the way on the alternator pulley.  I put the bus in second gear (on 
flat ground) and held the belt on the pulley while pushing on the 
engine.  I got lucky enough that it rode the rest of the way around.  
It was on, too loose for my taste but I had no tools.  I was able to 
push start the bus and get going again.  I was about 100 miles from the 
middle of nowhere (you know the place) when the alternator light came 
on again.  I stopped and checked and the belt was off.  I tried my 
trick again but it took a lot longer on the side of the road with a 
flashlight between my teeth.  Got in to start it up and nothing again.  
Pushed her again and got it going.  I gave up for the night about 100 
miles from Laramie.</pre>
