Dictionary of Terms          from the Bus/Vanagon List
<all years are by definition for U.S. Models. European, Canadian, and
Australian years and models may vary slightly>
--------------------------------------
** Bus Terminology **
--------------------------------------
BAY WINDOW  another name for the buses made from 1968-1979. so called for
            the large single-piece windshield.
BRICK       1. Vanagon model Transporters.  2. any VW Bus or Transporter
BREAD LOAF  usually refers to the buses made from 1968-1979, due to
            the resemblance of the body shape to that of a loaf of bread
BULLI       the German nickname for the original VW buses. loosely
            translated, it means "work horse" or "oxen" (some sort of
            strong animal used for pulling heavy loads.
BUS         1. any Volkswagen Transporter of any model and any year.
            2. specifically those VW transporters from 1968 to 1979,
            distinquished by a large one-piece windshield and rounded
            body contours. all had 'swing-axles'. also called T2
            Transporters.
CAMPER      a model of bus that contained interior features such as a
            bed, stove, cabinets, and in some versions, a refrigerator.
            some versions had a pop-up roof to allow extra room,
            ventilation, and sleeping room 'upstairs'. some of the
            many companies making Campers were Westfalia, Devon,
            and Country Homes.
CAMPMOBILE  another name for Camper versions of the VW Transporter. for
            whatever reasons, this term seems to have been dropped for
            the Vanagons, except in Canada.
CREW CAB    another name for Double-Cab pickup trucks.
CV-JOINT    one of the small circular devices at an end of an axle on
            a bus. Microbuses have only two of these, Buses, Vanagons,
            and Eurovans have four, while Syncros have eight. these
            are necessary to allow the axle to move up and down while
            still turning to propel the car. the joints need to be
            keep greased to function properly. when they are worn, they
            make a knocking-noise that strikes fear into the hearts of
            bus owners everywhere.
DEVON       an English company that made camping conversion VW buses.
DOPPLE-     the German name for Double-Cab Pickup Truck.
  KABINE
DORMOBILE   another company that made camping conversions of VW buses.
DOUBLE-CAB  the VW Pickup Truck characterized by seating for six and
            three doors. a 1/2-ton vehicle.
EUROVAN     any of the Volkswagen Transporters from 1992 to present.
            some were sold in Europe in 1991. generally characterized
            by their engine located in the front of the vehicle,
            driving the front wheels, and their very rounded shape and
            huge rear hatch.
KOMBI       generally accepted to mean a mid-range trim model of a
            Volkswagen Transporter. that is, NOT a utility/commercial
            truck, and yet NOT a Deluxe model with all the bells and
            whistles of luxury and convenience. usually, a Kombi has
            windows along the side, seats, and some side paneling.
MICROBUS    any Volkswagen Transporter from 1949 to 1967,
            characterized by a split (two-piece) windshield and rounded
            body contours. all were powered by beetle Type 1 engines
            and all had 'reduction gears' on the half-axles. known also
            as T1 Transporters.
PANEL       a model of bus that has no side windows behind the front
            doors. usually a commercial model.
PICKUP      a model of bus that had a flat load bed with no fixed roof
            over the rear half of the vehicle. see Single-Cab and
            Double-Cab. optional canvas tents were available to cover
            the rear flat bed area.
PRITSCHEN-  another name for the Single-Cab pickup truck.
  WAGEN
SAFARI      a type of front windshield that tilts outward for additional
  WINDOWS   ventilation. found only on Microbuses, and usually only on
            on those in equatorial/tropic countries.

            21 or 23 Windows and a Sunroof.
SINGLE-CAB  the 3/4-ton version of the VW Pickup Truck. seating for
            three people.
SPLIT       the Microbus, made from 1949 to 1967. also called a
            Split-Window.
SYNCRO      the four-wheel drive version of the Vanagon, made between
            1986 and 1991. using a viscous coupling arrangement, the
            front wheels could be made to automatically provide pulling
            power (at any time the rear wheels began to slip or spin).
TRANSPORTER any of Volkswagen smaller trucks and vans. known as Type 2,
            they evolved through four (4) 'generations': T1, T2, T3, and
            T4. but the entire line of vehicles has always been called
            'Type 2'.
TRANNY      1. an affectionate name for Transporter. 2. an American
            slang term for Transmission.
VANAGON     any Volkswagen Transporter from 1980-1991, distinguished

            windshield. also known as T3 Transporters, or Caravelle.
WESTY or
WESTFALIA   one of many Camper versions made from a basic VW Transporter
            usually the only Camper version imported into the U.S. by
            VW and sold at their dealers.

YMMV     Your Mileage May Vary
--------------------------------------
** Technical Terms **      (real ones)
--------------------------------------
ABS      Anti-Locking Braking System. a computerized method of helping
            to prevent wheel skid/lock-up during braking. it does NOT
            prevent spins, NOR does it allow you to stop in a shorter
            distance. it DOES allow you to steer the car while braking
            as hard as possible. available as an option on some Vanagons
            and Eurovans in Europe during the late 1980's-1990's.
AFM      Air Flow Meter. the silver box next to the air cleaner box
            on the fuel injection model buses. it measured the volume
            of air entering the intake system, and allowed the computer
            to adjust the amount of gasoline required.
CAT      Catalytic Converter. a large, usually round cannister in the
            exhaust system. it helps convert emission gases into more
            harmless, less noxious vapors.
CCA      Cold Cranking Amps. a bogus number printed on the sides of
            automobile batteries to confuse the buyers. generally, the
            bigger this number is, the easier the battery will crank
            your car when everything is frozen. assuming everything is
            in perfect operating condition, of course.
DIGIFANT a form of fuel injection found on VW vanagons/transporters
            from 1986 and later. a later variation of Digijet. also
            reported to be a slightly less complicated version of the
            Bosch Motronic fuel injection used on BMW's and Porsches.
DIGIJET  a form of fuel injection found on VW vanagon/transporters
            from 1983.5 to 1985. characterized by a digital 'map' of
            the 'proper' fuel quantity vs engine rpm and temperature.
DOT      Department of Transportation. an agency of the U.S. Federal
            Government that has authority over some aspects of auto-
            mobile construction, especially in the safety-related areas.
ECU      Electronic Control Unit. generally refers to the 'computer'
            that controls the fuel injection system.
EFI      Electronic Fuel Injection. computerized metering and
            squirting of fuel, replacing the carburetor systems.
            introduced into the buses in the mid-70's.
EGR      Exhaust Gas Recirculation. one of the emission control
            techniques, in which gases are sucked from the exhausht
            pipes (before the muffler) and re-circulated through the
            intake manifold (to be 'burned' again). the high heat
            associated with exhaust gases required expensive metals
            ... so replacing/repairing this system can be costly.
EPA      Environmental Protection Agency. another agency of the U.S.
            Federal Government that gets involved in automobile
            construction, especially in the engine emissions area.
KPH      Kilometers per Hour. speed measured in the metric system.
L/100km  Liters per 100 Kilometers. a measurement of fuel economy in
            the metric system. note that this is exactly backwards from
            the American system of miles/gallon.  the metric measurement
            denotes the amount of fuel required to go a certain distance
            roughly, 10 L/100km = 23 mpg.
LED      Light Emitting Diode. those little red/green/yellow 'lights'
            that almost never burn out. sort of solid plastic light
            bulbs. and they use very very little amounts of electricity.
LPG      Liquid Propane Gas. the stuff that the stove and refrigerator
            use for fuel in the campers.
MPG      Miles per gallon. the American measurement of fuel economy,
            denoting the distance traveled for a certain amount of fuel.
            roughly, 20 mpg = 12 L/100km.
MPH      Miles per hour. the American measurement of speed.
PCV      Positive Crankcase Ventilation. a method of reducing the
            pressure inside the engine crankcase (the middle part where
            things are whirling around, but nothing is exploding).
TUV      an agency of the German Federal Government. sort of a
            combination of DOT and EPA, as well as being responsible
            for inspecting cars before they are allowed to be driven.</pre>
