   <pre>Hello fellow Volksters and travelers,

    As many of you know I just returned from a rather long trip across
country and back again. Thanks again to all that provided *needed*
advice and offers of help....as you'll see they came in handy.

    I left the Portland, Or. area 10/7 in the early morning by the time
the sun was coming up I was headed east on I-80 and feeling good. Well
this lasted for 173 miles when I stopped for a nature call near
Boardman, Or. My '75 VW 9 Passenger bus...with only alittle over 21,000
orginal miles decided to die....turned the key and *Nada* :(( Well I was 
feeling very bummed at this point as I called AAA for a tow. I feared
the worst...blown engine or something major. Was I ever pleased to learn
that it was just the starter and as luck would have it I got it replaced
and was back on the road in 6 hrs :))
   Due the delay I only made it about 500 miles that first day but after
a few hours sleep I was back heading east and Utah was coming up fast. I
made it thru Wy. and into Neb. by the latter part of day 2. My decision
to stop there was prompted by my getting stopped .... Neb. State Patrol!
He claims I was weaving and crossed the fog line....I tried to explain
that my bus wasn't very *Aerodynamic* and swayed when trucks passed.
Plus it was windy which only made matters worse!! He still said he had
to write me up but only a warning. I did ask if he saw the trucks pass
me and if he knew I was doing the speed limit. He responded yes to both
but failed to see the point .....if I was doing 65 and trucks are
suppose to do 55 *WHY DIDN'T HE STOP THEM* ??? But I kept my mouth shut
and remembered I was out of state and didn't need to inspect the Neb.
jail system :)
   It was at this point that I thought I could smell gas...and since it
was just then noticeble (heat on low) I decided to stop and check it out
in the light of day. Early the next morning I opened the hatch to find
the engine seal soaked with fuel :( I had taken the advise I got and
had  *ALL* the gas lines replaced. Well I drove to the next town..Kearny
Neb. and found a fantastic mechanic. It turns out it was the small hose
connector which connects the fuel line to the #1 injector that was
leaking. I had them replaced (Yes all of them) and again in 6 hrs was
back on the road. Now I was determined to make up for some of my lost
time. I drove straight thru the rest of Neb....Iowa...and Mo...before
stopping in Ill. This too was not without some minor excitement :))
While passing thru St. Louis I was almost *Creamed* by a gal that didn't
know how to merge....then in an attempt to get a picture of the *Arch* I
almost ran off the road (which wasn't helped by the guy behind me who
decided if I was drifting off towards the barrier on my right....he
could pass....WRONG!!) Oh well two escapes from death were my limit so I
stopped at the next rest area :)
    OK now its day 4 and since its a Saturday traffic should be light
and except for all the construction Tenn. and Ky. went smoothly. I took
this day alittle slower and enjoyed more of the scenery. By the end of
the day I had crossed into NC and after making it thru the mountains
decided to stop and rest. Day 5 and it was off to my first major stop of
my trip. I drove to CarrowWinds (Paramount Amusement Park) located on
the state line between NC and SC. A close friend of mine works there and
I stopped to surprise her. Spent the rest of the day at the park then
drove back to the Charlotte area (Lincolnton) where I spent the next 6
days. 
   On 10/17 I spend part of the day back at the park...then headed back
on the road towards Asheville. After driving thru some of the most
scenic country roads I arrived at my next stop....Marv and Lucy Krupps.
They had invited me to stop (based on my inquires to the list) and share
in there annual BBQ and swap VW stories. It was a very pleasant visit
and I got needed rest. After a great home cooked breakfast and a
mini-tour of some local landmarks I was off and headed west and south.
    My next destination being Austin, Tx. That day I made it out of NC..
thru KY..TN...GA...ALA...Miss...and stopped just after crossing the
Miss. river. By the evening of the next day (Monday 10/19) I was in
Austin,TX. and visiting friends there. I was alittle bit worried since
this was the time when Texas got all that rain and floods were all over
the news. But aside from some rain and lots of very flat and *Boring*
scenery things were rather uneventful. After a day I was back headed for
Los Vegas, Nv.  This portion of the trip was easy and I made the 1350
miles in just a few days....arriving in Las Vegas on Thurs. 10/22 AM .
     After a overnight stay with friends I was off to Anaheim for a more
extended visit with a *Very* close friend. I arrived in the LA area at
3:00 pm Friday 10/23 and spent the next 3+ hrs looking at taillights and
smelling exhaust...yuk :/ 
    On the evening (late) of 10/28 I took off again and headed north on
I-5....heading for Pleasent Hill (Oakland area) CA. I got into Pleasent
Hill early on 10/29 and crashed (slept) for a few hours before meeting
friends for breakfast. I spent the next day there....left late on 10/30
heading north to I-5. I stopped along the way to sight see (esp. Shasta
area) and stopped for the night (10/31) in Yreka, CA. After breakfast on
Sunday 11/1 I spoke with my friend in Anaheim and decided to go back for
a few more days. Being inspired I arrived in Anaheim that same night
(see what love can do). I stayed there until Friday 11/6 mid afternoon
and with reluctance hit the road again. 
   This began the final leg of my trip....Hey I heard that :)) I drove
straight thru to Yreka...getting there about 3:00 am on Sat. 11/7. I
decided to get a couple hours sleep and was *VERY* surprised when I woke 
up at 6:30 to find 4-5 inches of snow :( I soon found out that I-5 was
closed in both directions. North was the worst....heavy snow and
accidents. South was just snow and would be cleared that morning. After
getting something to eat I decided to avoid battling trucks and heavy
traffic north. South seemed more logical....so it was I-5 south to
Redding....across to Eureka and 101 then north to Crescent City...very
slow 2 lane roads but very scenic and clear. I spent Sat. night in
Crescent City and in the am took Hwy 199 to Grants Pass, OR and I-5
heading home. I arrived home just as the sun was setting on 11/8.
   All in all a very good trip....no other mechanical problems after the
gas problem in Neb. So after 35 days and 8,850 miles I'm ready to do it
again.....Hey Marv and Lucy...Hows the weather in Florida?? Hehehehehe.

Thanks for your patience if you got this far :))

Happy Motoring and See ya's on the road,

Pete</pre>
