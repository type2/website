   <h1>Hydraulic Lifters, a definitive word (long)</h1>
   <b>&quot;John Anderson&quot; &lt;janderson_at_iolinc_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1999-02-18 16:27:12+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>A lot of talked surfaced over the last few days on this subject, and some
statements have been made that aren't strictly true.  I'm going to strive to
set all things straight on this subject but first I want to note for
everyone's sake.  WE HAVE DEALT WITH THIS BEFORE.  Many, many, many, many,
many times.  Ken maintains a www site dedicated to this list for a purpose,
use it.

Now first off I'm going to make the big sacrilegious statement that will
send a lot of people off howling in pain and disbelief, to them I say use
your brains for a second and get over it.

Despite what the ignorant ramblings of a stoner bus driver who wanted you to
keep something alive imply (hey I've read the original printing), and
everything your mama ever taught you about VW's, it IS NOT necessary to
adjust HYDRAULIC lifters stone cold, in fact as I will later present there
are times and means where you purposely strive for this not to be the case.
To anyone put off by this assertion, quit reading now, I don't care.  To
those who want to learn from someone who actually knows, who's owned plenty
of buses, vanagons, whatever, with hydraulics and adjusted them every which
way countless times, read on.

I'm going to back this statement up right at the top with cold hard fact.
When you adjust a hydraulic lifter, you are adjusting it to contact plus
somewhere between 1 and 2 turns of the rocker arm adjuster screw.  I'll give
everyone a hint, that screw is a special fine pitch 10mm but still is good
for 1mm per turn, that is .040" per turn, so taking a happy average of the
information available you will be adjusting to .060" past contact.  Now
think for a second about why on a solid lifter car you adjust the lifters
stone cold, the reason is so that you aren't adjusting them when valves are
warm and "stretched."  I'm also a mecahnical engineer, and I'm not going to
bore you with numbers but think for a second about what YOU know, we adjust
those solids to .006" gap, that means come hell or high whatever we take it
that an exhaust valve will NEVER stretch more than .006" in use, else we
would be holding it open all the time even when on the backside of the cam
lobe and that is way conservative, they aren't going to probably stretch
more than a few thousandths of an inch.  So we know a valve isn't going to
stretch more than .006", we know that VW over the years has proffered an
adjustment range from .040" to .080" past contact on the hydraulic lifters,
frankly that valve can be as hot as it can get and you still have a 3 to 4
time slush factor either way of a "perfect" adjustment.  So get over it,
they don't have to be cold, now obviously you don't want to burn yourself or
anything, but get over the fact the engine can have just run.

Now why are we doing this.  Well you just bought that beautiful lime green
and rust '78 Westy and when you start her in the mornings you get something
between a tapping to pounding sound from the ole engine changing with engine
speed.  You remember what the ole bug, 60's or early 70's bus, whatever
sounded like with loose valves and this sounds the same but even louder,
even up to a hard pounding beat.  You think you got em hydrauleeec lifters.
First, how do you tell?  Couple ways.  Pull a valve cover, any valve cover.
Take the mini Mag Lite and look up a pushrod tube around the rocker arm.  If
that little pushrod is only about the size of a big round (3/8") pencil all
the way end to end and looks steel (probably brown and oily), chances are
there are still hydraulic lifters in there.  If instead right behind the tip
behind the rocker arm the pushrod steps out to a big ugly aluminum rod
(probably closer to 1/2" diameter and probably more silver in color) chances
are you have solid lifters in the block, if they are all currently adjusted
to somewhere in the .004-.008" range you can guess pretty much for sure.  By
the book only GD, GE, or CV blocks came from VW with hydraulics but only '78
and '79 GD blocks, all Vanagon CV blocks came.  But hydraulics could have
found their way into any T4 block over the years along hopefully with a
hydraulic cam and the steel pushrods.  Now obviously if you see steel
pushrods and if when you rotate each cylinder to TDC and try to get a feeler
between the valve tip and rocker screw and there isn't a gap, you got em,
hydraulics, a good thing actually, but why that infernal pounding.  Well the
hydraulic lifter lets the valve ride on a cushion of oil, always maintaining
perfect preload and contact on the cam but not so much (oil pressure
balances the spring pressure) that it holds the valve open.  Now as these
accumulate time (say your '78 shows an actual 120k or so on the original
engine, though they can get noisy much earlier if not driven, not
maintained, etc) the lifter parts lose their tolerances and overnight, or
after setting, the oil inside them leaks out, air leaks in and when you
start he up, the air has to find it's way out.  Imagine the lifter as a
syringe of water, but with the needle end closed and flat against the cam,
the plunger against the pushrod.  Now that water inside is instead being
pressurized constantly to 40 psi or so (oil pressure) from a little hole in
the side of the syringe.  If a big bubble of air leaks in so it is only half
water and half air inside, and if everything is closed off (by the external
oil pressure when you start the car) the air is trapped and when you push on
the plunger the air compresses and the plunger can collapse easily some
distance before a balance is achieved.  Oil can't be squeezed, air can be,
air is no good.  You can check for this if you have the noise.  Go along
with a big screwdriver and try to push on the bottom end of the rocker
shafts, right in line with the pushrod (when the cylinder is near or at TDC
and the valve train is not loaded, though many of the valves will be
unloaded at once so give em all a quick push.)  The rocker shaft is knurled
right where you press so the screwdriver won't slip.  When you press (and I
mean a good hard press) there should be NO MOVEMENT, at all.  Chances are
some of them will be "soft" when you press them, maybe will move in say less
than 1/16" of an inch feeling spongy.  Those have air, but are probably OK.
Then there will be a couple real offenders, you will be able to shove them a
good bit, these have big time air in them, little oil, you are basically
just compressing the big spring in the lifter.  So we have hydraulic
lifters, they have air in them, what do we do.

First off, nothing.  Does this happen every day?  Does the rapping stop
after 10-15 minutes driving?  If you drive the bus everyday does it stop
even faster?  My first opinion, unless you know the engine has been fooled
with (by an idiot), amd the bus hasn't been driven in a few weeks, change
the oil to something light (10W30), put on a new filter, and sit there in
the drive and rev it up and down for 15-20 minutes, staying in the 2000-2500
rpm range.  Get it good and warm but don't rev it too high.  If the bus has
sat for a few months, or even a few weeks, and begins to quiet out, then
subsequently quiets out each morning after even up to as much as 10 minutes,
and isn't banging REALLY loud don't sweat it.  I parked my old '78 on a
sideways slope for 8 months then fired her up, it always had 2 dying
lifters, they pounded for 1/2 an hour, and I mean pounded.  Make sure all
the rocker shaft nuts are torqued correctly and go on be happy.  And NEVER,
EVER, use Quaker State oil.  I don't care what Arnold uses in a commercial
with his dad's tractor up in Latrobe, don't run QS in VW hydraulic lifters.
Generally though I do run the oil VW recs, for me in my climate that means
10W30 winters (but only if it stays cold else maybe some 15W40) and 20W50 in
the summer.  VW is very conservative about oil, they rec thicker stuff than
anyone out there.  Use good oil, change it every 3-5000 with a good filter,
and running the proper weight oils aren't going to cause you any noise or
trouble.  I use Castrol GTX or Shell Rotella exclusively.  In fact I can
often run the Rotella 15W40 diesel weight oil year round say in a camper
that doesn't get everyday use.</pre>
