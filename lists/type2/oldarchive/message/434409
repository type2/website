It is.  In your case, UPS ground takes two working days (average) to get to
your address.  If we had taken your money for UPS-Air, it would have gotten
there in the same amount of time for about 5x the price.

So I call today and find nothing was

Actually, the RMMW component of this is the problem.  I don't know what's up
with them, but recently they have been the most unreliable supplier I have
ever dealt with.  I typically order from them weekly (as their wholesale
division is one of my many suppliers), and they have always shipped the same
or next day (as does everybody else I deal with).  For the last few weeks,
they have been telling me orders shipped that never even left their
warehouse!!  In one case, I paid extra to have an order sent 3-day-air.
When 4 days went by and it hadn't arrived, I called, to learn that they
hadn't even sent it!  They agreed to send it that day, 3-day air.  Four days
later, I called again and it still hadn't shipped.  They once again agreed
to send it 3-day air.  Instead, they finally sent it via freight carrier,
which took another 9 days.  So, three weeks later, my 3-day shipment finally
showed up!  I'd have notified my customers if Motorworks had only TOLD me
that the parts wouldn't show up for so long, but each time they assured me
that the parts would arrive within a few days.  In another instance, I asked
them to dropship a pair of bumpers to a customer in California, also 3-day
air.  Instead someone in their warehouse switched labels and sent them to
someone in Idaho!  So I called and they apologized and agreed to ship
another pair, again 3-day, directly to the customer.  3 days later, this
pair showed up here in Pa. instead!  So on the third try, a week later, they
finally got it right!  Now, the manager of Motorwork's wholesale divison
assures me, after getting an earful from me, that they have rectified the
problems and that they are back to normal again (which was, until a few
weeks ago, very reliable).  Meanwhile, I'm ordering from other suppliers,
even if at a higher cost, until I'm confident that I can rely on them again.
Your exhaust is an item that I had to get somewhere else because of this
situation, although, as we told you on the phone today, we will be supplying
a better system to you for $20 less than the original quoted price.  I was
under the impression that Mari, who took your order, had told you that we
would try but weren't sure we could get the order to you by Friday.  If she
didn't, she should have, because I had told all of my employees about the
Motorworks situation.  I could have gotten you a system by this weekend, but
it would have been what I consider to be an inferior brand to the one we're
sending you, whereas the ones arriving tomorrow or Monday (Pacesetter) are
in my opinion much better quality (and for less money).

I do my best to offer as fast delivery as possible at the best price
possible.  We don't always succeed, but we do try.  Unfortunately, sometimes
these things are beyond our control.  Given the recent situation at RMMW, I
don't know if you would have had any better luck if you'd ordered directly
>from them.  I can say that you would have paid much more money.
Furthermore, ground shipping from them to you would have cost about 3 times
the price we charged, because of how far they are from you, and would have
taken a week, IF they had even shipped the order remotely on time.  And air
delivery of heavy exhaust parts from there to you would have probably
exceeded $100 in shipping alone.

If you absolutely, positively need a part within a few days, the only 100%
safe way to get it is to bite the bullet and buy it from the dealer or local
auto parts store at the full retail price, where you can have the part
handed to you right then and there.  Situations like backorders, supplier
problems, or UPS shipping delays, are out of my control and sometimes
unavoidable even if we do everything right on this end.  We try our best to
accommodate rush orders, and ship out parts via overnight air every day to
people who need a part fast.  But like I said, unfortunately, nothing is
100%, especially when you're dealing with tens of thousands of parts on one
Bus, not all of which can possibly be in stock (or even available) at any
one time.  The one thing we can do is that if one supplier is out of a part,
I have 12 more I can try to get the part from, whereas if you order directly
>from say RMMW or WCM and they're out of it, you're just out of luck until
that one supplier gets it back in.  But again, tracking down a hard-to-get
item by calling 10 or 12 different suppliers takes time, and isn't always
condusive to your getting the part within a day or two.  Something as simple
as an exhaust for a '77 may seem like an easy item to get, but if you narrow
the field down to those products that I would feel comfortable putting on my
own bus, there really aren't that many choices out there.  Frankly, some of
the ones that RMMW and others sell, I wouldn't recommend.</pre>
