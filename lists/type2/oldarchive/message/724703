   <h1>A Story</h1>

   <pre>Well, since it is pretty quiet now and most everyone is already
going home, I thought I might as well tell a story of my own.
Back in '85, I still had my '68 bug.  We also had the new Sentra
we had just bought one month after buying the house.  At this
time my father was also wrestling with the ravages of melanoma.
Linda and I would visit as we could, but we still had to work.

As Christmas drew near, I decided to take the engine out of my
'68.  I don't remember why but, maybe it was because of an oil
leak or something like that.  I think it was the first time I
had done this type of thing at the time.  Okay, so was a late
bloomer.  Anyway, the car sat on jack stands and I'd spend some 
time working on it in the evenings and the weekend.  It must have
been more than the oil cooler because it seemed to take longer
than you would think.

We went to my brothers house that year for Christmas Eve or Day,
I don't know which, because we switch each year so that both
sides of the family get visited fairly.  This applies to Thanks-
giving too.  This was the first year that my father hadn't made
Christmas to who's ever house it was being held at.  He was
definitely missed.  We, however, had a pretty good time considering.

So the New Year rolled around and I think I got the bugs engine
back in and it ran fine, but the darned oil leak persisted.  I
thought about it, and thought well maybe I had the wrong oil cooler
seals in or had tightened it down too tight or not tight enough.
Muir was kind of vague in this area and I don't really know if
he could have made it more clear.  Anyway, towards the end of
January, I tore into it again and worked in the same situation
as I did before on it.  Marking everything as Muir suggested.
Drawing diagrams and using baggies for the nuts, bolts and screws
etc.  I really would've screwed things up if I hadn't done this
even though the '68 engine compartment is pretty simple now that
I've tackled it a few times.  Especially compared to the '74 bus.
Hoses 'Everywhere' as Muir put it. ;)  Anyway, one night I was
putting the whole schmutz back together, and I remember I was
futzin' around with the tin and the gas line when in walks this
orange (tabby?) kitten into the garage.  It was real friendly and
just snugglin' up to me like I was cat-nip.  This continued on
with an occasional remark from me like "who's cat are you?" or
"ya better watch out, I don't want to step on you now."  Well
this went on for maybe 1/2 hour or so and I continued wresting
with the hard to reach bolt on the driver side that connects the
tranny to the engine.  I heard the phone ring and I knew Linda
would get it cause she knew my hands were full.  Well she came
to the garage door and told me it was Lynette.  Well, I kinda
stopped and I looked at Linda and she at me.  I went to the phone.
My sister-in-law told me that my father had passed away.  We
talked for a bit and I finally hung up the phone.  I think I
was kinda in shock cause I couldn't really say much.  Meanwhile
Linda was there and I told her and she made sure I was all right
by asking a few questions.  Well I opened the garage door and th
kitten came right in and still snuggled up to me so I sat right
down and started petting and scratching it.  I'm not sure why
it cared to nuzzle me though, my fingers must have been still
greasy from the engine.  I asked Linda if she had anything to
feed this kitten and she checked the fridge.  She said we had
the left-over turkey, so I put some in the bowl and gave it to
the cat.  It seemed to like it and ate it.  I wondered and asked
Linda what she thought about keeping the kitten.  She said, well
if you want to it was okay.  Unfortunately, we had to go down
to my moms the next day so we weren't sure what to do.  Linda
volunteered to go to the store to get some cat food, a litter
box and some litter, and a bowl or two.  I stayed home with the
cat and just sat on the floor and played with it.  I discovered
that it was a male.  Well, this made me think about my dad and
I just was kind of amazed.  Linda came back with the stuff and
we set the cat up and eventually went to bed.  

We decided the next morning to leave the kitten in the garage with
plenty of food and the litter box.  This may sound cruel, but I
didn't know what else to do at the time.  We also asked our 
neighbor to keep an eye on it while we were away.  

We stayed at my mom's for a few days and came back only to find
that the kitten had escaped after the first day we were gone.</pre>
