   <h1>A Permanent Member of the Family (part 2 of 2)</h1>
   <b>Ron Van Ness &lt;rvanness_at_neuron.uchc_dot_edu&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1999-05-21 19:01:30+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>[Continued from Part 1]

My brother-in-law is shiftless, that is, he only drives automatic, so I
anticipated being fully caffeinated for the duration of the trip. I
considered teaching all the quirks of a 30 year old, butt sitting over the
front tire driven beast to a newbie, but those Pennsylvanian mountains
loomed ominously in the back of my mind's eye and there I saw my tired
destiny.  In a moment of love and pity, my wife unexpectedly boarded the bus
at the critical time of departure and announced she would be driving the
CT-Toronto-NYC leg and would leave us to suffer the round trip to Chicago.
I protested.  Yes, the miles would be draining.  But this trip was rich with
the potential for male bonding, and I could not allow feminist interests to
intervene.  We would have our rugged four day weekend across America's
interstates with all the freedom two men alone have to mess up the
directions, as well as rights to embellish with tales of dramatic hardship
overcome.  But my wife was not moved by my thoughtful, if not ridiculous
arguments.  She stuffed me in a sleeping bag in the cargo area and took
control of the vehicle, piloting us northwest toward Toronto.

With no interior to dampen the vibrations, the engine whined its shrill
3,700 rpm song for hours along the highway.  Proving I was a true bus
fanatic, if not somewhat deaf, the rpm lullaby put me to sleep.  It helped
that my wife handles the bus exactly as I do.  That comfort relaxed my mind,
and I dreamed off faintly hearing the shift points and decelerations in the
background as if my alter ego were driving.   I awoke somewhere outside
Rochester, New York.   At a gas stop there we met an aspiring bus owner.  He
had a '77 lined up to buy, but he'd only seen it in the dark.  I knew
exactly what he meant.  He was excited.  I was excited for him.  He'd been
enjoying Thom's Vintagebus page and I directed him to Type2_dot_com for further
reading.  He was one of the many people I would meet along this road to
Chicago who wanted a bus.  

We arrived in Toronto at nearly 3am and settled for a few hours nap.
Packing the bus was like trying to fit sardines from two cans into one.  We
had leftover sardines.  So out went the sardines (I mean of course, boxes)
and we stood them on their heads, pushed tails from one against the heads of
others and finally packed the bus with a solid mass, with just enough room
aft of the front seats for floor seating and for the additional boxes we
would retrieve in NYC, as well as the furniture stacked on the roof rack.
The furniture projections from the roof rack were offset by the improved
aerodynamics of the newly lowered bus.  The front wheels were considerably
closer to the wheel wells, the rears were becoming hidden by the body work.
I empathetically felt the tension of the torsion bars and leaf springs as if
they were straining within me.  I gave a cheerful thumbs up and my best race
winning smile, feigning the prospects of a successful journey.  I listened
for the creaking of the chassis as I crawled into the bus and assumed my
position on the floor between the seats. My wife slowly accelerated the
waddling bus onto the QEW.  

Not that we all don't know, but the VW bus is a marvel of engineering.  To
make a similar trip in a large diesel powered moving truck would amaze
nobody.  But filling an under-powered 30 year old bus to the brim with boxes
of text books, taxing the small engine to run at maximum rpm over the course
of days and expecting it to complete the journey successfully is the stuff
"B" movies are made of.

Crossing into the US through the checkpoint via the Canada/US border can be
a harrowing experience for VW bus drivers.  The randomly horrific
experiences faced by unlucky drivers are well chronicled in the digitized
lore found in the Type2 Archives.  Despite a few crossings in the bus, we've
not been searched.  Once, in a tidy '79 Buick Regal, our dirty laundry bag
was "briefly" seized and searched.  It was returned to us unscathed and of
course, still uncleaned.  Since I had already removed the camper interior
there was no chance that an impatient inspector could damage the dried wood
in an effort to track down an errant 30 year old roach under the floor
boards.  For an anxious moment I imagined them tearing apart the engine.
Still not so bad, but there I was without my Permatex 3H for case sealing!  </pre>
