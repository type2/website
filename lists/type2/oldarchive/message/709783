   <h1>Hit from behind by a car going 90mph</h1>
   <b>eugp_at_uclink3.berkeley_dot_edu (Eugene C. Palmer)</b><br/>
   <i>1995-10-03 01:17:17+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Volks,

My latest experience in my 1971 VW bus is kind of rough.  As I was driving
home from a Bon Jovi load-out at 1:30 am on route 24 west, traveling at
about 60mph, some drunk who apparently thought my fabulous double taillights
ment that he was still on the road, nailed me hard on the left rear of the
bus.  He then veered to the left a bit, kept his foot hard on the gas, and
continued down the freeway.  I looked around, trying to figure out what the
#^&*!, kept the bus traveling straight, noticed the dash was lighting up
red, and tried to see who and what car hit me.  We were both alone on this
stretch on highway, and there were no streetlights.  I couldn't tell what
car other than an american novaish shape.  Couldn't see the driver at all as
he passed me, couldn't see the color, and couldn't even catch the plate
number as he took off.  Got one digit I was sure of, _2______.  Realized
after about three seconds that he was not going to stop, that there was no
way I could get close enough to read the plate even if I floored it till the
engine seized.  So I backed off the throttle, shut the engine down, and
coasted towards the next viable place where I could walk off the freeway.
This turned out to be quite a ways since it was downhill.  I passed
Childrens hospital and parked it on the shoulder just after the on-ramp from
MLK way.

Bus is toast on the left rear, slammed all the way to the wheel, he had to
doing 90-95.  Oil fittings torn off the external cooler, Oberg filter
dragging on the ground, entire back of the bus covered with oil.  I'm lucky
that the metal didn't quite hit the tire, which would have wasted the tire
and caused a much worse accident.  I can put my hand through into the rear
of the car from under the rear hatch.  Gotta love those headrests I searched
so hard for, and the basic seatbelt factor (it was on).  I was also
concerned about the whole thing going up in flames should the oil have
cought fire, or if there had been a gas leak.  I'm fine, just a bit achy
around the shoulders and neck.  I'm now home from work, hanging around on
muscle relaxants trying to straighten out the insurance process.  I have a
whole new perspective on drunk drivers.  Even if the guy had pulled over,
I'm not sure I would want to confront a drunk with a .45.

I walked back on the freeway to Childrens hospital and called 911, who
refered me to the California Highway Patrol dispatcher.  She took the call
and when I told her I couldn't ID the car or driver, said a patrolcar would
meet me where I was.  Then I called Hali, who came out too.  Of course Hali
got there before the CHP.  After an hour I called CHP again and they said
they were busy and said I could file a desk report on Monday, if I wasn't
feeling injured.  Since I didn't feel too bad we went home and tried to go
to bed.  After about three minutes of discussion, and realizing that I
really was hit hard and might not understand the injuries myself, we decided
that the prudent thing to do was go to the emergency room, bringing books
along for the inevitable waiting.  Called the CHP again and they said call
when you get there and they will try to get someone to take a report at the
ER.  Paperwork is very important and I didn't want to get stuck with a
report that did not include injuries.  This requires the police to be
present within 24 hours.  

Get to the ER at 3:40am, seems quiet for a Saturday night.  Call the CHP
from the waiting room payphone. When checking in and showing my insurance
card the nurse informs me I have to clear this ER visit with my personal
care physician.  Even for an auto-accident?  Yes indeed, so she calls and
gets the approval.  Pay the $35 ER fee.  I then get a return call from the
CHP sargeant, who seems reluctant to send an officer on this busy night, but
when I tell him I was hit hard while doing 60 mph, he softens up and says
he'll send someone down, says it could be a while.  Start reading the book
in the waiting room.  CHP arrives after about half an hour, we talk in a
separate room, two officers.  They take the report and mention that without
a _driver_ ID, there isn't much they can do.  They also say that the car is
supposed to be towed within 4 hours, but that nobody was really going to do
much if it wasn't.

Get called into the ER area about an hour later, where we sit on the bed for
another hour.  Dr. comes in and checks things out, says I'll hurt more
later, doesn't look like anythings bad, take these muscle relaxants and some
ibuprofen, don't go back to work right away, (I had a week of overnight
double-time calls lined up) take it easy.  We leave the hospital at 7:30am
and get some breakfast.  Go home and call about getting the bus towed, they
say someone will be out within half an hour so I stupidly believe them and
go back out to the car.  Wait an hour and a half, dozing off.  Finally get
disgusted and go back home.  Call and of course they are now waiting at the
car, but won't tow without someone there.  Go back out, sign the paper and
show my insurance numbers, finally get the car towed home and into the
driveway.  Finally get some rest, after a few more phone calls from work,
where they are punting without me.</pre>
