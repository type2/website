   <pre>Hybrid Vanagon
 
by James Sly
 
VW & PORSCHE January/February 1989
 
So what's the slowest Volkswagen you've ever driven? An old
split-window van, maybe? Or a Diesel Vanagon? How about a Diesel
Vanagon fitted with the Westphalia Camper option? How about a
Diesel Vanagon fitted with the Westphalia Camper option and 70
thousand miles on the clock? There couldn't be much on the road
slower than that.
 
And David Andrews, owner of said 1982 Vanagon Diesel L
Westphalia, was tired of always bringing up the rear. It was a
great used car deal when he bought it in 1985 for $6500 - the
sticker on the Vanagon showed that it first sold for more than
$17,000 but ...
 
While the camper part worked great, as Westphalias always do,
the Diesel part was slow. Real slow.
 
At first, David felt that he could live with the sluggish
performance. After all, it was a vehicle to relax in, a
recreation vehicle, right? Even so, the virtue of patience is
sorely tried in such a slug and David soon became frustrated at
how slow it really was - like about 21 seconds 0 to 60, for
example. It was true that the vehicle could hit 65, on a gentle
downhill slope at any rate, but it was also true that it was
hard-pressed to maintain that speed. And on freeway on-ramps,
David vows that he could see the drivers behind him swearing and
shaking their fists, thinking that he was taking it easy when he
really had the Vanagon flat-out floored.
 
Compounding the problem, David was not raised on slow cars.
Volkswagens, yes. Slow cars, a resounding no. A 20-year
acquaintance of hotrodder Darrel Vittone of Riverside's
Techtonics Tuning, David was also an employee of EMPI, the most
famous VW tuner of the '60s and early '70s. As an added
distinction, David has the honor of being one of the few drivers
to ever win a major NHRA drag event in a Volkswagen, when his
1967 Beetle, running in A-modified Compact, beat all of the
factory Chevy, Dodge and Ford entries to win class at the 1975
Pomona Winternationais. Volkswagen, yes, but this Beetle had the
habit of running consistently in the 12s-slow like a cheetah.
 
Anyway, the Diesel was considerably cheaper than a gasoline
Wasserboxer Vanagon would have been and it fit the budget. David
lived with the aggravation for another 14,000 miles, planning a
conversion to a gasoline engine at some later point. Slowly but
surely, the Vanagon went from Mexico clear to Alaska, and back
and forth across the U.S. two times. (David notes that a Diesel
Vanagon gives one the mentality of a bicyclist: Terrain that
looks flat from a car really isn't to the cyclist or Vanagon
Diesel owner. Take Kansas as an example: For someone in, say, a
GTI, going east to west is level, if boring, terrain. For
David's Diesel, crossing Kansas was a steady and exceptionally
dreary uphill grind, with a top speed of 55 mph. Finally,
perhaps mercifully, the Diesel block cracked at 84,000 miles.
Rather than rebuild the Diesel, David opted for a gasoline
engine swap. Now that Techtonics is concentrating on research,
development and sales, and doing little installation work, David
is doing some installations of the potent Techtonics 2020 motor.
He knew firsthand about the durability and power that Techtonics
parts offer, so naturally that was the route he elected to take.
He used an early, pre-1983 1600 block as basis for the swap.
 
In converting the Vanagon from diesel to gasoline, it would have
been a lot easier to simply use carburetors, but the advantages
of sophisticated Bosch CIS injection were desired. After all,
with the camper's weight to haul around, low-end torque and
driveability are all-important - and those are two things that
carburetors simply do not deliver. And while the fuel mileage
with a heavy aerodynamic brick like the Vanagon is not great,
the added gasoline that carburetors would burn would have been
an extra penalty.
 
Any engine conversion requires attention in several critical
areas: Adapting the new motor to the old transmission, getting
it mounted properly, getting the cooling system hooked up and
working with the added horsepower, and getting intake and
exhaust systems that fit and work.
 
One of the joys of this conversion is that no adapter is
required for the engine block, either to the transmission or to
the motor mounts. The stock Diesel bellhousing allows a direct
bolton of the gasoline block: tilt it over at the same angle as
the Diesel motor and it's a perfect mount. The new gas motor is
fitted with the slick stock cast aluminum oil pan off the Diesel.
 
David solved the exhaust system problem by using a 1980 Dasher
dual-downpipe exhaust manifold, which required slight
modification to the stock Vanagon motor mount. Next time around,
David will use a late-model Dasher unit that will not require
any mounting mods. The resulting dual downpipe exhaust is an
effective, torque-boosting 4-2-1 system, and finishes with a
custom exhaust and muffler. The current system does not use the
Lambda oxygen sensor for increased fuel mileage, but David does
plan to upgrade soon.
 
On the induction side, the injection air intake manifold is off
an early Rabbit, with '79 injection system components supplying
the fuel. The manifold has had Techtonics welding and porting to
allow fitting the larger Neuspeed throttle body. There's a
special knock-out Plug under the rear fenderwell to allow
adjusting the idle speed screw.
 
The fuel filter, pump and accumulator are mounted up by the gas
tank on fabricated mounts. For future conversions, David would
simplify the installation by using the late-model Golf
components that are already mounted as a unit.
 
A large 80mm diameter airflow sensor plate, as used on the early
cars and on 1983-84 GTIs, measures air and sends out the fuel on
the injection system. Each line had to be custom made and fitted
from the fuel distributor to the injectors and cold start valve.
The material was not easy to come by. Many companies have the
line available in one-meter or 39-in. lengths, but that wasn't a
help as this project needed longer lines, with the longest being
a 54-in. line to the cold start valve. David did finally find
the fuel line and get the custom lines made up.
 
The Vanagon s transplanted engine features one of Techtonics'
GTI heads to fit on the earlier blocks. Stock VW GTI 40mm intake
and 35mm exhaust valves are used for their good wear
characteristics and trouble-free operation. Valve actuation on
the solid lifter head is by VW's G-grind camshaft, chosen for
both good low-end torque characteristics and long lobe life
offered by a German billet cam.
 
In the block is a Techtonics stroker crank, with 88mm stroke.
Combined with Techtonics 82.5 pistons, the motor displaces
1881cc or 115 cu. in. The compression ratio is 9.5:1, helping
both performance and fuel economy.
 
Stock cooling components have had no problems keeping up with
the substantial infusion of added Techtonics horsepower. The
cooling system changeover was not too difficult to engineer,
which is one reason that converting a Diesel is most feasible,
as all the water lines are in the right place. There was no
cutting of sheet metal or extra water lines to run. Some of the
water lines were changed around and some copper fittings were
employed to allow the use of hoses less costly than the factory
pieces. If you've seen some of the contorted examples of
specially molded Vanagon hoses, and looked at the prices, then
you know what we're talking about.
 
The water reservoir was moved to the original battery box
location and the battery box moved to the front of the right
rear fender well, where the battery was located on VW buses in
days of old.
 
Air conditioning made the engine swap considerably more
difficult, as David fabricated almost everything in the
sophisticated, effective AC system. But, if you live in a place
like Riverside, California, where summer temperatures soar into
the 100s, you too would view the work that went into creating an
air conditioning system for the Vanagon as part of the basics.
 
There's a lot of air to cool in a Vanagon and it took some work
to come up with a system that really works. David's super air
conditioning system uses a Sankyo 508 compressor as currently
seen on most VWs - A Diesel Rabbit factory AC mounting bracket
is used with the alternator moved to the "up" position and the
compressor mounted below so as to clear the stock engine cover.
It took careful belt sizing to match up the AC compressor and
the alternator: David reports spending five or six hours just
getting the correct belts, as a belt that's too long allows the
alternator to go too high and touch the engine cover.
 
The custom AC installation has a total of three condensers, with
large units located in front of the radiator, behind the
passenger side headlamp and a smaller unit under car. Inside,
there's two evaporator units in specially fabricated housings,
one in the rear of the large interior and one in the front. A
GM-style accumulator is mounted to improve AC system
performance. And it really works. We took a test ride on a
90-degree high-humidity day and were blown away by the quick
cooling power. It seemed more like a refrigerated delivery truck!
 
Separate controls are mounted for the front and rear air
conditioning. In order to help control the electrical demands on
the system, a trick wind activated switch shuts off the front
condenser fans over 25 mph, with a solid state relay
incorporating a timed delay to prevent rapid on-off fluctuations
near that speed. A two-speed radiator fan from the newer A-2
chassis Golf/ Jetta is used, with another, a stock fan, timed
delay on high speed to provide additional fan power.
 
The resulting all-VW Hybrid Vanagon is a pleasure to drive.
Though the vehicle's still an aerodynamic brick, the new motor
will push it to 90 mph. ("Toto, I think we've finally made it
out of Kansas. . ") We didn't have a chance to time the
acceleration, but subjectively the car is noticeably quicker
than a Wasserboxer gasoline Vanagon. Coupled with the low-geared
diesel four-speed, the Vanagon jumps out, even with the
sophisticated air conditioning on and three or four on board.
Fuel mileage with the Diesel was about 23-24 mpg. The more
powerful gasoline engine delivers a respectable 18-19 mpg. The
Diesel was rated at 49 hp. We estimate that the 1881 is putting
out about 125 hp, a modest 255-percent improvement.
 
The engine turns 4000 rpm at 65 mph, which is a bit buzzy. David
feels a better choice of transmission would be a gasoline
Wasserboxer 4-speed or 5-speed, which would require a simple
bellhousing change to use. It's likely that a different
transmission would improve the fuel mileage as well.
 
In many respects, this is not a simple swap, but it's certainly
an interesting one. Used Diesel Vanagons are a real bargain in
the current market. The added horsepower of a gas high
performance motor can turn a Diesel Vanagon into a much more
desirable vehicle. Tune-ups and parts are easy to get, as is
service, and the sophisticated air conditioning system that
David constructed is mere icing on the cake.
 
But, like many other upgrades, this is one project that is not
quite finished. We mentioned the future Lambda sensor, but David
has some other changes in mind: perhaps a Techtonics 2020 motor
for long hills. One thing's for sure, David might return to
Kansas again, but next time he'll find it more level than he
remembered.
