   <pre>Volks,
	This story was posted earlier today on the Fordnatics mailing list,
of which I am also a member.  It had a lot in common with stories that
have been posted on this list, so I thought you all would enjoy it even
though it has no VW content.  Kemper Porter (the author) has given me
permission to repost his story.  He is a member of a car club called the
"Vicksburg Cruisers".  Apologies to those on both lists (probably just
Steve Maher) who have to see this twice.  :)  Hey, it *is* almost
Friday...

> roof tops. He was back in no time. He braked at the bottom of the hill and 
> the inside drum locked chirping the rear tire gleefully. Lance let out 
> another Yodel and brought 'er to a stop. He must have contracted British Mad 
> Cow Disease because he began babbling and his eyes were loco. Steve turned
