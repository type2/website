   <b>copygod &lt;copygod_at_mail.pernet_dot_net&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>1999-02-19 09:34:11+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre> well, hello all.  this is a mass e-mail, just thought that i would send
this out to those of you that might be concerned about what goes on in
my life.  i think i've just done one of the stupidest things that i've
ever done.  after a two and a half hour conversation with my girlfriend
(heh, well...), we decided that we wouldn't kiss anymore.  or visit very
often.  or call very often.  or buy presents for no apparent reason any
more.  or go on dates.  trust me, i didn't do it because i wanted to,
GOD made me.  if it were up to me, we would date and eventually get
married and have kids and a nice little life together.  but i goofed up
and put her on a pedastal... you know, the one marked 'idol'?  yes, i
made the classic blunder of putting her before GOD, and i guess for a
while He was cool with it, but eventually He wanted me back...
jealously.  as in i can't have her anymore.  at least not now.  who
knows, we might go out again and get married and still have kids, but it
won't be for a long time.  i think she's the second-best thing that's
ever happened to me, and i'm afraid that i might not get her back.  but
i know better than to argue with GOD.  i might complain, but i'm not
telling HIM how to run my life.  quite honestly, i think she's the best
friend that i've ever had, and if she's not, she's got to be tied with
joe and jeremy.  we had a really good conversation, and after we decided
that we were broken up, we started sharing even more intimate/odd
things....  i think i like her.  i know i love her, but GOD doesn't want
me with her, at least not right now.   listen to your sunday school
teachers, she might make a good GODly girlfriend, but the girlfriend
does not make a good god.  no matter how awesome she is.  this is the
weirdest breakup that i've ever been through, and i've admittedly not
been through many, but were we supposed to talk for two hours after we
broke up?  i mean seriously?  have any of you ever critiqued your ex
about their performance as a boyfriend/girlfriend?  ten minutes after
you broke up?  honestly and without anger or spite?  i've always thought
we had an odd relationship (i liked it, but c'mon), i guess it's fitting
that we would be really good friends after all of this.  we never yelled
or argued or got mad about anything, i think we spent half the time
apologizing to each other (i know i did) about how we should have been
better for the other persons sake.  she's the best girlfriend that i've
ever had.... well, WAS.  and i just called it quits on her.  its okay,
though, she was pretty much feeling the same way, but didn't want to
hurt me.  i take that back, i guess i did get kinda mad.  she really
should have worried about her walk with GOD and obeying Him more than
how i would take losing her.  and the thing is, we both still really
like each other.  i think that GOD just isn't through with us yet, so
now we have to give up on each other to let Him do what He needs with
us.  and i'm starting to make plans.  i have a lot of free time now, no
more two hour conversations every other day, no more thinking about how
awesome my (ex)girlfriend is.  no more reviewing what we talked about or
did the other day.  so i'm starting to make a lot more commitments to
GOD.  like really starting to study His word.  like thinking about Him
while i'm at work with a shovel instead of my (ex)girlfriend.  like
starting a bible study with some of my friends.  and really buckling
down and working on achor dumah... my next 'zine project.  it's kind of
scary to think that we might never go out again as dating, or that she
might go out with someone else tomorrow night.  but one of the things
that GOD's been dealing with me on is that i have to give her up
completely.  not just call off us dating for a while, to get back
together when we're done playing holy-rollers.  but to let her go with
the chance that i might get a phone call from her in a year inviting me
to her wedding in the summer.  one of the things that i've been thinking
about and comparing this to is avraham and yitz'chak (abraham and isaac
for those of you without a complete jewish bible).  i have to be willing
to give her up with no chance of getting her back in my power, and turn
her over to GOD.  and trust that He will prove Himself faithful in His
promises, even when i can't see it.  anyways, thats the most important
thing that has been going on in my life.  if you want to ask some
questions, feel free, i'm here.
