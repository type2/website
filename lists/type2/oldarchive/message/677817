 Thanks Fred  Well here is my thoughts on this...This
and 3 bucks will get you a small coffee in this
town(Calif Coast).You wrote....Is it machinery or
mindset that makes the difference in our approach to
traveling?....For me it is an "M" word MONEY! My Dad
is a rich man from a Construction business he and his
two brothers had well he retired when he was 50..(30
years ago) oldest of the three and like your in laws
he just goes man.No sleeping in cars but when he takes
off thats it 3...4...5..months at a time.No worries
just bring that plastic credit card(Very Light and
easy storage) and no mountain pass is to high no gas
bill to large,he travels in a 35 foot Dolphin
Motorhome.You know color tv... microwave style.Well I
caught a ride one time to go back home for a week or
so to have a run at the local ladies(no luck) Well
after a gas stop in Baker,Calif (hot place) he said
you drive.Up the grade we go....then BANG!
BOOM..flop...flop...pull over..take a look...broken
fan belt destroyed plenty..radiator...radiator
shroud...no problem._dot_call tow truck(or was it the cop
that called?)$$$$$$Tow$$$$$ to Vegas$$$$$dropped off
at repair shop$$$$$wait 2 days for parts in
lot$$$$$$fixed RV$$$$$$$3,000 Bucks$$$$$$no sweat ran
both the AC's the whole time$$$$$$$$seeing Mom and Dad
were living in the RV while out(homeowners policy) and
about Dad gets the insurance company to cover his
repair bill$$$$$$$$.Total charge to him.....Oh about
two large pizzas.My point is when my bus caught fire
outside of Barstow I was standing on that hot desert
freeway trying to make a deal with the tow truck
driver to take me back the 15 miles to barstow for
less than $200 bucks and drop me at a Kragens parts
store were luck would have me find a couple of VW fans
than put my bus back together in the parking lot and
even gave me a flashlight.Cost to me for this
fire$$$$$$$around 300 bucks.So.....unless you got that
plastic and a good home owners policy...Take some
parts and join a tow club.   Mark and his 67 butt
burnt 13 window Deluxe (all better now)
