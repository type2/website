   <pre>Vanagon at Altitude: No Problem. I lived at sea level and took
weekend trips to 8000'. Now I live at 8000', and take it over
10,000' passes. It runs fine. Of course it is underpowered and I
am constantly shifting gears when going up long inclines. The fan
comes on too..just like it is supposed to.

> My Bug-Out experience started on Saturday, during the prep for the show.At
>about 4PM, I decided to polish the wheels on my Notchback. (I still haven't had
>time to rebuild the Vanagon tranny yet!) As long as I had all of the wheels off,

>force the fluid out. So I'm happily bleeding away, pushing REAL hard on the
>brake pedal, and the pedal suddenly sinks right to the floor! I press the pedal
>a few more times (as if I expect it to magically recover) as I bemoan my fate.
>Turns out the metal brake line from the front to back rusted out. So I had the
>fun task of replacing that animal. By time I get to the store, buy the parts,
>remove the seats and carpet,install the line, bleed the brakes again, and polish
>the very tarnished wheels, it is 1:30 AM on Sunday.
>
>Sunday morning: Up at 6:00 am. Drive to friends house, and on to Manassas.
>Stopped at supermarket for supplies. I didn't know how may burgers I would give
>out to Listmembers, but to be safe, I buy 15 lbs of hamburger and mondo rolls,
>chips,etc. Got to Manassas right at 8:30 AM---IT IS PACKED IN THERE!! Guy at
>gate doesn't want to let me in the show, says it is filled. Squirm my way in
>anyhow. (I gotta get there earlier next time!) Set up Notchback in show area and
>start looking around.
>
>First stop: SWAP MEET!
>I love the swap meet section. I used to take down loads of parts until they
>started charging $50.00 per spot! Not too much going on there. Saw one pair of
>crusty Safari windows, and a set of side windows (louvered) for a 1960's Westy.
>Two different individuals had the complete breadloaf Westy setup for sale.
>Another was selling just the stove unit for one. Several Bus IRS tranny's, also.
>One guy had a blue '81 Westy for sale--$2500!! It was in decent condition, small
>amounts of surface rust and worn paint.
>
>Next stop: VENDORS!
>Saw a few things down there. First, there was a guy selling class III trailer
>hitches for Vanagons--I think it was Derek's buddy. I bought a new, genuine VW
>windshield for my Vanagon for $145.00. Does anybody know if this is a good
>price, or did I get squealed?? Most of the other parts were for Type I's.
>
>Next stop: SHOW!
>Headed right for the Type II section. Very impressive turnout. Saw everything
>from splitties to Eurovans. Saw fellow listmember Pete Krough's '85 Westy in the
>show. God, I need a pop-top! They are too cool!! Seriously thinking about
>selling my '88 and getting a Weekender or full Westy.
>
>Next stop: LUNCH!
>Fired up the grill and relaxed, taking in the VW ambience. The view from my spot
>was incredible! Directy behind me, a forest green '59 Single cab. Next to it, a
>two-toned blue '86 (?) Crew cab fron Ontario. Further down, a wonderful
