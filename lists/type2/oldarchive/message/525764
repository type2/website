   <br/>
   <pre>~
I did not decide that I was going until very late Thursday afternoon.  Our 
bus is sick and unable to make it and I was so disappointed b/c I had been 
looking forward to it for months.  I decided that I would just go anyway and 
sleep in a tent.  So that is exactly what I did.  

I arrived on Friday at around 9pm.  I was amazed at how many bussed turned 
out already, and there were still more pouring in.  I got my gear out of my 
trunk and started to set up my tent .... Oh no!  NO POLLS!!!  Luckily I had 
packed an extra tent (don't know why) and I used it instead. (whew)!  I 
checked in with Chris, & spent the rest of the night socializing with old 
friends like Uncle Dave, Sherry, and Snoopy, who I had missed since 
Thanksgivings Misgivings, as well as some new friends like Rob, Jon, and 
others making smores up by the fire.  After staying up much later than I 
should have I found my way back to the tent, and went to sleep thinking about 
how nice that evening had been, what a great turn out there was, and looking 
forward to Saturday.

Woke up on Saturday at around 7:30am, my neighbors dog had put its face right 
up to the screen window in my tent so I opened my eyes to a great big black 
mussel staring back at me, (quite a sight 1st thing in the morning when the 
vision is still a little early). After petting the pooch it was off the bath 
house, for an icy cold shower, then to find some STRONG coffee to get me up 
and going.  Found some new Full Moon members from Asheville, NC who had 
brought very scrumptious breakfast burrito's and helped them get rid of that. 
(Sorry, I don't remember names.)  Spent most of the day hanging out and 
making new friends.  The weather couldn't have been any better. I got to meet 
so many cool people like Danielle who is quite the artist (even when 
intoxicated) and Bear (and daisy who is in charge of driving)!  It was 
finally time for the chili cook off, and dinner.  Wow!  There was sooo much 
food, & everything I ate was good!  I am glad that I was not a judge, there 
is no way I could have decided on one!  Chris then whistled for the door 
prizes to be given out, and everyone took a seat out on the lawn.  There was 
enough door prizes for every child to receive something, which I thought was 
extremely cool, as well as most of the children cleverly disguised as 
responsible adults.  Shortly after the prizes were handed out, there was a 
roaring fire back where the case was being burned.  Before long, the whole 
area was lit by the burning magnesium.  Always a sight to see!  A band 
gathered back at the picnic shelter and entertained a large crowd for a few 
hours.  I was one of the crowd, and really enjoyed singing along with songs 
that I forgot I knew.  Quiet time rolled around and the band broke up, me and 
several others made it back around to the fire that was still burning nicely. 
 As the hours went on, there were fewer, and fewer, until only and handful 
remained.  The final few went to bed when we ran out of fire wood at about 
4am or so. Each and every one thankful for such a magical day! 
 
Sunday rolled around much to early for some one who didn't go to bed 'til 4.  
Walking around looking for coffee, watching most people breaking down there 
camps.  I said good-bye to the few friends I could find, (sorry to those that 
I missed) and left around 9-9:30am.  Visited some relatives I had in the 
area, and headed home for charlotte, NC.  I passed Snoopy on the way home, 
honking and waving final good-byes to him and Megan, and smiled the rest of 
the way home.  I had the best time ever on a campout like this.  To those of 
you who didn't come, you should really try to make it next year!  I am so 
glad I decided to come! Chris, thank you so much for getting this all 
together, I know it was more work than any of us realize, and you handled it 
all so VERY VERY WELL!!!  Thanks to all the new friends I made and I hope to 
see you all very soon at the next camp out!

PS  I am the one who brought the chocolate busses.  If anyone is interested 
in getting any more of those let me know, they are around $2.00 a pack of 4 
and they are really cute!  They won't mail, but I will bring a case with me 
to the next campout!

Thanks again!
