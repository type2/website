   <h1>Electrical (&other) issues - pt II (quite long)</h1>

   <pre>(74 - 224)

Well, it was raining today. I hooked up the battery (actually, PO's
battery - mine won't hold a charge) that I had been using, and the red
battery light came on, as expected. (No key in ignition.) I went back to
the engine compartment, unhooked the ground cable, and ran my test light
from ground tab (where ground wire connects to chassis/frame) to ground
post - light on, still appears there is a short. Darn, the VW fairy
isn't shining on me.

Then, I hooked the battery back up and turned on the engine, seemed a
little weak on start, but trouble light went out. It was raining, so I
figured I should make another attempt to get the wipers to work. Here's
what I have. I have a wiper switch, with four positions up and down, and
a pull-washer. Out of this switch comes four wires, one green, one
black, one black with brown stripe, one black with white stripe. (the
solid black may have a stripe too, unsure) Now, I have a wiper moter.
From it comes four wires, three in a rubber/plastic VW clip. These are
the black, black w/brown, and green. The black with white stripe goes to
a second VW clip with one insert for a female connector on one side, and
two on the other. This would appear to be a basic splice type of thing.
Also, there is a black with white stripe wire coming from the fuse
block, with switched (ignition) power. So, in the splice clip, I joined
the black with white stripe wires, (one from switch, one from wiper
motor, one from fuse block), and then I matched the other three wires
from the switch and motor through the other clip (black - black,
black/bwn - black/bwn, green-green.) No wipers. Nothing. No whir, click,
humm, anything. Looking back at the wiper motor through the slot where
the radio used to be, it appears that all wiring is firmly attached to
the motor. Using the test light, I confirmed that all black/white stripe
wires were receiving power. The green wire appears to be getting power
from the pull-washer switch. (actually, wondering about this too -
pull/release power on, pull/release power off, not what I would expect
for a washer switch.) The motor does not appear to be getting any power
except from the 12+ going along the black/white stripe. I attempted to
give it +12 on the black line as well, no effect. I do remember the
wiper motors working previously, but that was months ago. (while still
in the possession of the previous owner. So, no luck here. I decided to
taunt danger and drive without wipers in the showery afternoon.

So, not only do I taunt rain, but I taunt the law. I have expired tags
(about three months), no insurance on the bus, and I don't think I was
wearing my seat belt for most of the adventures. I intend to remedy most
of those issues within the next few weeks. I also have no turn signals,
as documented previously, due to having no turn signal switch. I do have
a good left arm, although it did not always make it out into the showery
afternoon to signal appropriately.

I take a little trip, first to a used bookstore to get a Bentley book.
They have none. At the bookstore, the engine exhibits similar behavior
to previous occasions. Once warmed up, the engine does not like to turn
off. After I have turned off the ignition, the motor continues to cough
and sputter for a bit, jumping about, and then finally die with a sigh
and a lot of smoke (coming mainly from the heater boxes, from the tubes
where the blower fan used to attach. A key to the ignition on position
will imediately restore engine, so it seems that after it stops
receiving spark from ignition input, it is still trying to turn over and
run. I would assume this is a points/dizzy issue, or perhaps plug
cables? I know precious little about points and dizzys, so I'm not
entirely sure. I know if you rotate the dizzy a bit, timing changes. I
know that certain plug wires need to be on certain posts. Beyond this, I
am generally clueless. The little wire from the coil is pretty damn
essential. I had a jeep that had a problem keeping this wire connected.
(and the jeep sometimes exhibited similar behavior!) Anyway, for the
rest of the day, I stalled the engine against the transmission and brake
with much better engine ending success.

Then I go to the gas station, and decide to fill it up. This is the
first time I have filled it fro a pump, the only other gas I put in was
a gallon or two of Chevron 87 octane from a jerry can. Anything else in
the tamk is likely about a year old, and possibly contaminated with
water. (bus had no gas cap when it came into my possession, since
remedied with an old locking cap from that old AMC jeep - fits fine!)
Anyway, I thought I had run it out of gas at one point (directly before
I added the jerry-can gas), but at the gas station, it only took about
5.5 gallons (of 89 octane) to fill it. So, something isn't quite right.
Further, the gas gauge actually showed a full reading (first time I have
observed it giving any reading at all.) But, not all was good.
Throughout the rest of the day, the gas gauge readings were erratic at
best, and I don't think it was giving a reading when I finally got home.</pre>
