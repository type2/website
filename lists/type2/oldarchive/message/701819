>To All:
>
>This is part sermon, part saga.  I'm not sure which part is which.
>
>I had to make a trip to Modesto, four hundred miles and change from my home
>in Vista, near San Diego.  Weapon of choice was my 1967 baja'd beetle, mostly
>because it's faster than the '65 bus and gets better mileage.  The bug has
>one seat.  It is heavily modified.
>
>Left Vista at noon on Tuesday, arrived in Modesto about eight hours later.
> Weather was hot (90+) for most of the trip.  Average speed was high (80 to
>90).  Combined with a lunch stop and a couple of 'comfort' stops, block-speed
>worked out to about 60mph, fuel consumption a little better than 20mph.  No
>problems noted although oil temp ran about 240 -- 20 degrees higher than
>normal even for hot weather, and pressure about 40, 10 pounds lower than
>normal.  Oil was 30W, a change from the usual 20W-50 in anticipation of the
>hotter weather in the Central Valley.  And yes, it did get warm.
>
>Driving around Modesto I noticed a new sound from the passenger-side front
>wheel.  Checked the bearing and found it failing.  Cleaned the hub, replaced
>inner & outer but was forced to re-use the old oil seal, unable to find a
>replacement.
>
>But the problem wasn't with the bearing, it was with the spindle.  Before I
>acquired the car it had suffered a spun outer bearing on the right front
>spindle.  Apparently the long high-speed run up highway 99 had allowed enough
>motion between the race and the spindle to wear it below spec.  That's just a
>guess; I carry a lot of tools when I travel but no precision instruments.
> But the new bearing was a loose fit.
>
>Shopped for a replacement spindle at all of the local junkyards.  Found some
>nice buses including a pair of Westies (Pic & Pull, near Empire, east of
>Modesto) but only eight bugs, only one of which had spindles I could use and
>of course they were already gone.
>
>Decided to head home early, take it slow.  Big mistake here was to elect to
>travel south via Interstate 5 instead of highway 99.  I-5 is pretty barren.
> Departed Modesto about 6 pm Friday, counting on low speed,  the cooler
>evening hours and the slightly higher elevation of I-5 to keep the bearing
>cool.
>
>I spent nearly five hours to travel a couple of hundred miles south, stopping
>frequently to let the bearing cool, repack the thing and so on. I had one
>canteen of water (a gallon), used it to cool the bearing, repacked it twice.
>  About 11pm  I knew I wasn't going to make it home on the spindle/bearing.
> Called home, told them I would be late.  Repacked the wheel bearing and
>headed east, hoping to reach Fresno about 100 miles away.  Made it, or at
>least close enough to count, but it was the middle of the night (temp still
>in the high 80's).  I flaked out in the bug for a couple of hours, parked
>outside a junkyard.  (There's a fore & aft shelf instead of a passenger seat,
>long enough for a stretcher.)   Local activity -- and the heat -- woke me up
>about 6 am.  When I dismounted the wheel to repack the bearing, the cage came
>apart.  So I went ahead and removed the spindle.  I wouldn't be able to drive
>the bug but neither could anyone else.  
>
>As luck would have it, the yard where I'd parked didn't have any air-cooled
>VW's and no bugs at all but they put me onto one that did and a customer
>offered to drive me other there.
>
>I figured out what tools I'd need, made up a pack, put on my straw hat
>(standard Baja-issue), slung the pack over one shoulder, canteen over the
>other and started The Great Spindle Hunt.
>
>I didn't have any luck finding a spare spindle around Fresno but picked up a
>new set of bearings and an oil seal.  It was Saturday, hot -- over 100 -- and
>busy.  I was wearing levis, boots, long-sleeved khaki shirt and a lot of
>grease.  People were surprisingly kind; I had to pay for only one ride. The
>costume may have helped, or perhaps it was the temperature -- 105 at one
>point in the afternoon.
>
>Finally located a spindle near Madera.  Hitched a ride and got there just
>before they closed and was allowed to borrow a jack to facilitate removal of
>the spindle; I had a small floor jack in the bug but didn't add it to the
>pack due to the weight; I was giving lessons in sweating as it was.
>
>Got back to the bug about seven thirty, called home -- they were getting a
>little nervous.  Got the spindle installed, did a rough wheel alignment using
>two pieces of plastic water pipe as a gauge.  Couldn't do anything about the
>camber but got it close enough to work. Cleaned the hub with gasoline (the
>bug carries 25 gallons), got everything back together, started home.  
>
>Pretty dopey from the heat & work; probably a little dehydrated even though
>I'd downed at least a gallon of fluids during the day.  Kept the speed down.
> Got to the top of the Grapevine about 1130, called home to tell them I'd be
>a little later than expected.  It was cool up there, 4,000 feet above the
>valley floor.  Had some coffee from the truck, smoked a pipe.  Dismounted the
>wheel to check & adjust the new bearing.  Couldn't find the metric allen
>wrench for the spindle nut.  Had to empty the whole damn bug, search
>everything before I found it in the pack.  (I used a piece of nylon luggage
>with a shoulder strap as the pack to carry the tools when I went hunting for
>the spindle.)  Saw that as a sign; put all the tools back into their proper
>places, re-packed my bag, taking the opportunity to change trousers.  But I
>only had the one shirt, now a bit the worse for wear. (I'd left them hanging
>back of the shop when I loaded the bug for the trip, drove off without them;
>washed the one I had every night I was in Modesto.) 
>
>Motored on down the mountain just in time to run into a freak rain storm
>crossing the LA basin.  Lotsa lightning, heavy rain.  Engine ran fine but
>started having some electrical problems, apparently due to a slipping fan
>belt.  (The engine has no cover; if it rains, it gets wet).
>
>Kept it rolling; there's really no place to pull off until you get across LA.
> Pulled off near San Onofre, adjusted the fan belt.  Ruddy moon just coming
>over the mountains to the east, rising up through layers of clouds.  Odd,
>fitful puffs of wind.  It started to rain again as I neared Oceanside.
>
>I arrived home at 3:34 having been awake about 22 hours.  Total miles
>traveled, 923 to make-good a distance of about 870.  
>

>If you want to lose weight, buy a Volkswagen.  I lost eight pounds in two
>days :-)  
>
>If you live in Modesto, forget using America On-Line; local access is only
>2400 baud.  (Sandy Eggo runs 38,400.)
>
>If you travel for a few days, remember to No Mail the Vanagon list servor;
>musta been a couple hundred messages in the mailbox when I turned this thing
>on.
>
>Always carry a spare right-front spindle :-)
