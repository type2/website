   <pre>Hi Volks,
   Ok, so you want to here my most embarrasing and costly moment?  Here goes.

   A year ago last halloween, I received a call from a friend (Dale Ward)
and he said that he knew where a lady was giving away 2 buses and a bug.
Just come a get 'em.  Well, I told my bride, Barbra, about the buses.  She
said it wasn't a good idea. I deceided to go after them. I told the her
that I would look at them and if they were not worth it I would just grab a
couple of parts off of them and come home.  I called up the lady giving the
buses way and got directions and a fage discription of the vehicles.  She
told me the bug was already gone. Rats!  Saturday came and after some phone
calls, I came up with a truck and trailer to use. The truck came from my
brother-in-law and the trailer came from a friend, John who used to own
several VW's, (now he owns a Baja).
    Barbra deceided to come along with our 3 year old daughter, Angela. So
about noon we take off an a 1 an half hour trip to belchertown (MA).  The
first part of the trip, getting there, went without a hitch.  We arrived at
the ladies house to find a '79 bus and a '70 deluxe bus.  The '70 was
whipped.  Rusted out everywhere. I asked the wife to remove the crome
strips, I had a deluxe with some missing trim at the time. She also grabbed
the VW emblem and other easily removeable pieces from the bus.  The '79 was
in better shape body wise in fact it was in really good for a New England
bus. I thought it was a keeper. Only problem was the interior pieces were
gone. It did have a VW engine stand and an old FI bug motor inside.
    After getting some help from the ladies husband we loaded up the '79,
tied it down and got ready to head home.  I thanked the lady, (I never did
get her name) told her I didn't want the other bus and headed home. We
started driving home and as soon as we got going about 25mph the truck
became very unstable. So we kept it under 25. Now that may not be to bad it
will just take us alot longer to get home.  Only thing is that
Massachusettes isn't flat.
   We started down one hill headed into Amherst on route 9 and the truck
started to sway.  I tried the brakes but it only made it worse. Before we
knew it the truck and trailer were doing 180 degree spin in the road.  We
ending up going the other way, semi jack-kniffed in the road and the corner
of the van was on top of the bed of the truck. I checked on the family,
Barb was shaken but ok, Angela, locked into her car seat, was laughing and
asking to do it again. I go out and  looked at the damage and deceided to
move the truck off the road.  When we moved the truck the van landed back
on the trailer on top of the landing gear. The trailer tunge was bent and
the truck had a nice dent in the rear quarter where the trailer hit it.
During the spin the stuff in the van rolled around a bit making the sides
of the van look pregnent. The engine stand was mounted on a piece of 1/4in
steel and when it slid around it made holes in the side of the van and it
also knocked out the side window. So much for a good deal.  The police came
we called a tow truck and waited. I called a friends towing service from
town and it took them hours to get to us.  I had unhooked the trailer and
left to get some food.  We came back and waited some more.  This whole
incident started about 5pm and when 10pm came and the tow truck wasn't, we
went home. My friends tow truck was busy and then she didn't know what
truck to bring thats why it took so long to get out to us.
     Anyway, they arrived to get the trailer and van. It was 12:30am.  They
worked though the night to get the van off the trailer and get home. I got
a call about 8 am and Carol said it was a bitch of a job and it will be
$400 bucks fee.  She also said that she was keeping the van and the trailer
until I paid. You can imagine what my friend said. ($#&$#!%$!)
     I had a hard time coming up with the cash but I did it. Not to mention
the money for fixing the trailer and truck.  My brother-in-law was really
cool. He fixed the truck as best as possible, it was a work truck and had a
lot of dents anyway, and I had to clean and wax the truck for him.  My
friend fixed his trailer, I had to buy the materials and pay him for his
time. All said and done it cost me $550 dollars.
    The van still sits in the yard. I have no hope of getting my money out
of it. Its just a reminder of how stupid I can be. I have used the engine
stand.  Thats about it.  The front end is still good if anyone needs one.
Thats my story. Live and learn. Next time I'm renting a dolly and truck.
Thats if there is a next time.  Bye for know...
