   <h1>Engine Dies When Hot - Interesting Trip</h1>
   <b>DAVIDTHEKM_at_aol_dot_com</b><br/>
   <i>2000-07-07 22:14:47+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>OK, this is a question about my Thing, but it's Friday and the same info 
should apply to any bus with a 1600 like my old one had.

I had a fascinating trip over the Fourth of July weekend.  I had my stock 
1600 engine rebuilt 3 months ago and have been breaking it in gently around 
town, mostly to and from work and on errands.  It has run almost flawlessly.  
I have about 500 miles on it.  Two weeks ago I took it for one 60 mile round 
trip at 55 to 60 mph.  It ran fine, restarted, and came home fine.  FWIW the 
guy that rebuilt the engine put in an 009 because the vacuum distributor was 
shot.

This long weekend, I drove it from East Texas to Missouri to pick up a truck 
I was buying.  It ran fine at 60-65 until the first stop 60 miles from home.  
When I came to the first stoplight, it sputtered and died.  I coasted into a 
gas station.  There were bubbles in the clear plastic gas filter ahead of the 
fuel pump.  The filter was less than 1/2 full of gas.  There were also 
bubbles in the clear plastic line bubbling up like blop, blop, blop.  It was 
90 degrees, and this looked like the vapor lock I used to get in my '68 bus.  
I thought maybe it has never gotten hot enough in town to do this, and I'll 
have to reroute the fuel line somehow.  Right now it's on the left side rear 
of the fan shroud and left and above the pump.  Sure enough, once the engine 
cooled down, it started again, and I got back on the highway.  I also noticed 
when it was cool there was fuel in the line and the filter bowl was full with 
no bubbles showing.

I ran for the next 400 miles like this.  Whenever the motor had run more than 
a few minutes, if I had to stop, it would die.  It would not idle.  Once the 
engine was cool enough that the dipstick felt warm instead of hot, it would 
start again.  It ran very smoothly and strongly at 60 to 65 mph.  I learned 
to alternately clutch and brake with my left foot while keeping the idle up 
with my right foot when I came to a stop.  I wasn't always successful with 
this technique, however.  This made going through small towns in Oklahoma 
with one or two stoplights and the many toll booths on the Oklahoma turnpikes 
a very interesting challenge.  In one town with construction having taken 
away the shoulders of the road so I couldn't pull off, I almost got a semi up 
the tailpipe when the light suddenly went red.  He almost didn't see that I 
was stopped dead short of the intersection.

The only other symptoms are, that over the previous few weeks, it had begun 
to go from starting on the first crank to taking 4, sometime 5 or 6 cranks 
and some pumping of the peddle to get it started.  Then once it warmed up, it 
ran fine.  When it did this, it would catch briefly on the first crank, do 
nothing on the next 2 or 3 cranks, when catch again and keeping running on 
the 4th. or 5th. crank.  I also found that, on the road, once it was hot, if 
I had to slow down and shift from 4th to 3rd, it would die.  Both lights 
would come on.  However, if I popped the clutch while still rolling, it would 
start right up again in 3rd.  The same was true from 3rd. to 2nd.  Now that 
I'm home, it will not run around town reliably either.  As soon as it warms 
up, it will die when decelerating or stopping.

My trusted mechanic cannot get to it until the 14th.  That means unless 
someone can point me in the right direction, I will miss Kubeltreffen East 
next weekend, which is the biggest Thing meeting in the US.  I am very much a 
beginner with engines.  I have the Muir book and a Bentley for my '75 bus and 
a beginning collection of tools, but I don't have a clue where to start 
looking for this problem.  I don't want to just go about checking everything 
out because I would probably just get some things out of adjustment that are 
good now.  I also wouldn't know where to start or in what order to look at 
things.</pre>
