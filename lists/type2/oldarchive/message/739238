   <h1>Ex Bus Boy and Bus For Sale (CA)</h1>
   <b>oldvolkshome1_at_juno_dot_com (Old Volks Home)</b><br/>
   <i>1997-06-16 06:02:19+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>To my fellow listees - 

As of 3 1/2 weeks ago, I have terminated my partnership with Bus Boys,
sold my interest in them and have reactivated my existing (low profile)
business, which has specialized in weatherstrip products and small bits
and pieces for Bugs and Buses before there was even a WCM, much less
RMMW.  For the past 10 years, most of my business has been wholesaling to
places like Wolfsburg West, WCM, RMMW, etc., with retailing primarily at
the VW Shows here in the west.  Some mail order too.  It's possible I may
really blast into full time retail mail order again, but I have my hands
full right now taking care of bulk drop-ship orders for my existing
wholesale accounts, so that's why I've kept a low profile on the lists
during this time.

As to why I left Bus Boys.  As a minority partner for the past four
years, I was able to generate and implement some good changes based on my
previous experience in the VW mail-order world.  But the majority owner
and myself became at odds with one another in an increasing fashion, even
more so over the past 6 months as to the direction he wished the company
to take.  Another major problem was the quality and ethics of the persons
at the company I had to work with, including the majority owner, i.e. -
looking after their personal self-interests and not the company and
customer's interest.   A business' performance cannot be upgraded and
expect a nominal increase of sales and service standards if you give
minimal, spoon-fed support.  I got tired of being the only one doing
this, working way too many hours and receiving only minimal support from
the majority owner and most of the employees there.  After buttin' heads
for this length of time, I felt that enough was enough and decided to go
my merry way on my own.  Bus Boys has (and has always had) the potential
to become a better than major player in the Type 2/Vanagon market.  But
if the owner and the people continue in the fashion and direction they
are adamant in pursuing, they are going to have a rough and tough time
staying in the market.  I wish I could say more publicly, but the last
thing I need is to get into legal trouble.  But I will say this -  They
still haven't paid me for the first two weeks of May and I've had to file
a wage complaint to the State Labor Board for them to cough up the dough.
 A hearing is set for the 19th, so who knows?

As Dennis Miller says: "I could be wrong, but that's my opinion"

Bill will be handling the E-Mail requests and such, but until they get a
bigger stand-alone PC, I'm still maintaining their website for now.

To shore up additional financing for my business reactiviation, it looks
like my 67 Deluxe 21 Window is going on the market.  I have a lot of
spare stuff stashed away for it, such as a new headliner, sunroof cover,
interior panels (brown), seat covers and weatherstrip to go along with
the vehicle.  Have been going through my other personal stash and have an
extra NOS turn signal switch, dual circuit master cylinder, a used radio
that is correct for the vehicle (don't know if it works - I will have to
check it out) and other odds and ends that will go with this vehicle if
and when sold.  Also, when it was stolen in LA in Oct 92, the thieves
drilled most of the door locks but I was able to obtain a really nice
matched set of handles AND ignition switch at a show that will also come
with it.  The thieves also took the skylight windows and the popouts, but
I have also obtained new/used skylight glass and selected from my
inventory the best possible good used popout frames & glass to go with it
as well.  Good used sunroof assembly also included (one of the small bows
has to be riveted back onto the assembly.  A new Bus Boys Sidestep from
my inventory is also included.  As much weatherstrip in my inventory is
included (included is a NOS set of side cargo door seals that I purchased
from WCM about 5 years ago - still in very, very good shape, although
there are minor cracks in it here and there - paid over $165 just for
that).  New tires in 1992, still in fine shape with almost zero mileage
on them - mounted on the chrome slotted wheel rims ala 356 style.  I have
had this Bus since my father and I bought it new in June of 1967.  Bus
has 307,000 miles on the clock.  On it's 3rd transmission and 4th engine
(bone stock 1600).  No rust except in lower right windshield area and the
undercarriage and floor pans are "clean".  Interior is fair to good and
ALL seats are there.  Had to buy a Center Seat (3/4) a couple of years
ago because the original was stolen and it is the correct one for a 67
Bus.  All Jail Bars are there too.  Haven't fired it up in 3 years, so it
needs a battery, but it runs and drove it last in 1994.  Registration is
not current (93 sticker) but the title is clean, no liens.  I estimated
that that it would take about $2000 to $2500 to do take the knicks and
dings out of the body and painting to really make this a nice runner
again.  I have restored it twice before - not a 100 point restoration you
know, just something that is functional and nice to look at.</pre>
