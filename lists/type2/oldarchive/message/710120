   <pre>David,
Hello David. How are things in Atlanta?   I may be visiting an x-girl
friend in Decatur next month.  How far is Norcross from Decatur?  
I checked my contact in Marysville TN. J&M motors is the name of the
shop. The owner said he had not bought a Vw in months.  The story he
told me was that peolpe were stealing the cabs, striping and storing the
part, and leaving them to be found by the police.  When the insurance
payed off the car bodies went to the salvage sale. The theives would
then buy the car and have legal ownership to the car.  Within a few
hours they could reassemble the car and have a $10,000 car for $5,000
cash.  He said he had seen a few cases where they would come back with
the keys and steering wheels for the cars.  He also heard that the US
government was making small business loans to foreign vistiors to start
Businesses.  These visitor were using the money to steal and buy the car
frames.  True or not who Knows.

I am considering selling my Cab. I priced it to a man for $4400.  If  I
can turn that kind of a profit I may have to sell it.  After all I have
not bought a Vw in over a year and I fear I am having with drawals.

Good luck with the new beetle.  It really is neat car, but is it really
what the American Auto market is demanding right now. I am afraid that
VW USA has missed the mark again.  They have missed the mark for the
last ten years. I hope it is not to late for them here.

Later
