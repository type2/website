   <h1>Might be selling my baby! (68 Westy that is!)</h1>
   <b>VW_Westy68(-at-)webtv.net (Brian)</b><br/>
   <i>2002-03-14 14:07:21+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Hey all, well I think the time might be near to have to get rid of the
68 Westy. I have owned it for around 7 years, and it has definitely
served me very well. I hate to get rid of it, but with a new baby only a
little over a month away, it might be time. Well I will try to give you
a bit of an overview of it, and if anyone is interested, I can send you
pictures of any part of it if you would like. Its a 68, virtually rust
free westy. I brought it here to eastern PA from Spokane WA in the
summer of '99, when i drove it across the country. The body is in really
good shape, except for a few things, it has a couple little door dings
and what not, but the worst of the damage is on the nose. Looks like at
one point someone had some bad brakes and ran into something in front of
them. So there is a bit of a crunch up front. There is just a bit of
rust under the driver and passenger doors, I would assume from bad
window seals allowing water to get thru. But I dont think the minor rust
warrants replacement of the door skin. Its fairly small, and should
easily be taken care of. There is also a bit of rust right under there,
along the wheel arch, but once again, small amounts. And as far as I
know, thats it for rust and body damage. I dont think it has any major
bondo, but have never stripped it down, so I cant be totally sure, but
in the years I have owned it,  have never seen any traces. There is no
rust underneath, there is no rust under the front mat. Its really clean.
Like I said, it came from the west coast, and as long as I have had it
here in PA, it hasnt seen much driving. Maybe like 100-200 miles in the
last 2 1/2 years. I was having some engine problems, which turns out
that my intake manifold has a crack. Which I will be replacing hopefully
this week,  and then I will see how its running which should be fine. It
has a new carb, new gen, new coil, new fuel pump, new heater boxes, new
exhaust. But to me, the motor isnt the important factor of this vehicle,
because everyone wants their own thing motor wise, after all, this is
just an old 1600dp, and sooner or later you might want a new replacement
motor anyways.    In all honesty, I really havent wanted to have this
bus on the road  for the last couple years, It always felt good to just
own it and keep it off the road. I knew when the time was right I would
do something like this with it.

 So, I went over the body, and the motor, and underneath. The tranny I
replaced right before i moved out here. It works just fine, and doesnt
pop out of any gears, or make any odd noises, so I feel really strongly
about the trans. The cv's are all new, replaced myself, oh, by the way,
I am a mechanic by trade. The tires are great, they were winter studded
tires that i pulled the studs out of. The bus might need new brakes all
the way around, and I believe I have the brakes in the garage still, and
if I get the time, I may do the work, if not, they still work fine, and
brakes are pretty easy anyways. I recently replaced the steering box,
and there might only be 100 miles on it. I would feel better if the ball
joints were replaced, and like the brakes, if i get the time, I may do
the work. But as far as the front end goes, it steers straight, and
doesnt shimmy or wobble or anything, so its still good. As far as I
know, all the exterior lights work fine, both front and rear bumpers are
there and in good shape. All the glass is good, and I believe all the
window rubber is still in good shape.  I know nothing leaks inside the
vehicle. All doors work fine, as does the poptop. The canvas itself
could use replacement, I am pretty sure its still original, but it isnt
the worst, and still serves its purpose. OK, that should be the entire
outside and underneath covered. Now to the interior, which is pretty
much beautiful and original. The dash is in great shape, I think the
only crack is right above the ashtray. The speedo works fine, and I
installed one of those dipstick oil temp sender and gauge, which I
installed to the right of the speedo, in the blank gauge hole where a
clock might have went. The glove box is in there and is still in great
shape. There are NO kick panels, but places like the old Bus Depot has
'em fairly cheap, I should know, I worked there for a little while. The
front buckets would need to be recovered, they are still in fine shape,
but they are worn, and there are a few tears in them. The rearward
facing seat behind the driver is in great shape with no tears, and
plenty of nice soft cushion left as well as the rear seat..it still
folds down great, has no tears, and still is as fluffy and soft as new.
Same with the cushion behind the rear seat. The icebox I have never
really used for more than just storage, but it is in fine shape, seals
well, drains well, and looks good. The sink drains fine, and the hand
pump works fine. The holding tank still holds water. And overall the
cabinet itself is in great looking shape. At some point, someone
replaced the cabinet top with some linoleum, which you might want to
replace, but it looks ok. The sink top is still there, as well as the
arm that allows you to flip the lid over. The table between the reat
seats is there, and works fine, looks good. The closet is still there,
great shape, all works fine, looks great, both doors (front and side)
still work just fine.  Let me see, the flooring itself, I am not sure if
the  flooring in the rearward area is original or not, but it looks
fine. Ahh..the paneling..front door panels are in great shape, no rips
or tears. The rear panels are a different story. They are all the wood
covered paneling if you know what I am talking about, and they arent in
great shape. They are all there, but some of them might need replacing,
if you were to restore it. It never really bothered me much, kind of
added to the old mystique of the bus. It has  the netting over the bed,
and the spare tire with cover is back there, too. I have the front cot
that goes over the front seats, it seems to be in fine shape, although i
have never really used it. The upper cot is there also, no rips, but it
is old, and I dont think it would hold much weight anymore. It would
either need some reinforcing stitches sewn in, or replaced. The light
over the table is there, and works, although I got a propane heater too
close to it one cold night, and it started to melt the cover. But it
still works. I have a rear screen for the rear door, in fine shape, and
I also have many new parts for it, I would have to go thru all my boxes
and gather them all up is she sells. One more thing, along time ago, I
had a little bit of fireworks in my steering column. Which fried the
ignition, and the horn. I couldnt actually figure out how to get the old
ignition out, so I just spliced in another that hangs to the side of the
steering column, same with the horn, there is a button to the left side
of the column for it now.

Oh, we also have some cool celestial window coverings inside it also.   

So..after all that, I just want to say that I believe this is a very
nice bus, one that if someone wanted to restore it, this would be a
prime candidate. But even for a daily driver, it would be great. This
isnt going to be a cheap vehicle, I know roughly what its worth, atleast
in my book. And I am hoping the right person on this list might be
interested, or know someone who would want it. I know a few listmembers,
and I know if you are on this list, you love VW's like I do, so if you
have any questions, or want any pics, feel free to email me at
vw_westy68(-at-)webtv.net
Thanks for your time in reading this, if anyone did, sorry it was so
long and dragged out, but I was trying to answer some questions before
they got asked. 
Hey, I guess if I sell this bus, I am going to have to change my email
name. I look forward to any questions..thanks for your time...and boy,
will it hurt to sell it!
