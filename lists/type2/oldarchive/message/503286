   <br/>
   <pre>Thanks so much for your reply.  Yours was one of the only helpful responses
I got to my post about my hot start problem.  I'm fairly sure that poorly
adjusted valves aren't the problem.  I put new heads (along with pistons
cylendars and rings) on the enging when I recently converted from a pancake
to an upright, and I set the valves to 006 then, as well as having checked
them about every 300 miles since (it's only been 1200 miles since).  I have
tried adjusting my points, new points, condensor, cap & rotor, and I even
threw in my spare 009 for good measure, just to make sure.  No changes.  The
stuff you wrote about the carb seems to hit the nail on the head though.
I've been suspecting my carb for a while, as it acts up a bit.  For example,
when I come to a stop sign or something and push in the clutch, sometimes it
will just cut right out and die, unless I rev it up a little after pushing
on the clutch.  Once I get the carb to "catch" like this, it will idle fine.
Does this mean anything to you? I had disabled my choke about a month ago,
as per Muir instructions, but both the hot start problem, and the idle
problem happened before I did this.  I'm not sure that my jets or float is
clogged, but I'll do my best to check to make sure when I'm done writing
this.  Explain more about the float bowl being too low.  Where will I see
the gas pour in if I diddle the throttle, in the throttle body?  When it's
running, or when it's off.  All in all, I think I might as well just break
down and buy a new carb for $100 or so, but I want to make sure this is the
probleem before I blow the money.  The carb I have was rebuilt by a friend a
little while ago, but I'm not sure he did a great job.  It did run fine on
the last engine I had it installed on though.  I don't have the vacuum cut
out you talk about>  I say my engine is a 71, because that's what the block
is, but I put the rest together from stuff I already had or bought new,
basically its a stock 1600dp though.  Thanks for your great reply, it's
given me more ideas and encouragement with my problem.  I'll let you know
what I find out.  BTW, I live in Thorndike, Maine, not in the midwest as you
guessed.  Thanks again.

>Hi Dennis!

>I have a few ideas... read through this, see if you follow it's logic...
Then try it.
>
>--1-- First and foremost, check the valves.  My first impression is they
are too tight (likely if you can bump start it since your motor is spinning
faster and will have more compression than turned over by the starter)or too
loose, especially if when it starts is only runs on 2, then the other 2
catch. .006" on all of them.  If you have never done this before, it's one
of those things that need to be done every 2500 miles - it used to be on my
'first Saturday of the month car maintenance list'.  Read Muir's idiot guide
on how to do this.
>
>--1a-- And while we're here, recheck your tuneup stuff.  I have had wierd
things like points being off (or in one case the distributor was so worn out
you could wiggle the shaft side to side!!)mess things up.  Since you just
did a tune up, you can almost assume it's OK, but check again anyway.  >
>OK, That's the easy stuff.  Now it gets tricky.
>
>--2--  Your carb. might be faulty.  First, I'd replace the fuel filter, as
it's cheap.  However, I am guessing that your choke plate is either not set
right (not closing, causing a too lean condition), it has clogged jets or
junk in the float bowl, or the float level is not right (if it's too low,
you will still see gas pump in when you diddle the throttle <the accelerator
pump feeds from the bottom of the float bowl chamber, that's why> but it
won't have enough to run right). Having dry plugs when you check after a "no
start" is unsual - I have had wet (or at least damp) plugs when I have check
ed this, and that is what makes me think it's starving for fuel... I'm
pretty sure it's not electrical, esp. if all that has been checkes out and
is OK.  When I had to replace the carb on my 71 bug, it cost $110(32 PICT if
memory serves right).  With some of the additives in what they sell as
"gasoline", carbs wear out.  Also, if the body is worn out where the
throttle shaft goes throug!
>h, you will have an air leak big enough to cause problems. (My '60 was like
that, and it had me really lost until I replaced the carb and all was well.
I took the old one to the local HS autoshop teacher and asked him, and he
showed me.  Pretty cool!)
>
>--3-- I am wondering... this is wierd... but in 71 VW put this little
vacuum operated cutout in the fuel line.  I seem to remember in 71 they put
this little gizmo on the firewall or thereabouts, hooked by vacuum to this
valve... it was a complex system designed to keep fuel from running through
when the motor was shut off, overflooding the carb., and filling one's
crankcase with gasoline.  They only did it a year or two then stopped it,
and almost every 71 I've sen has had this bypassed with no ill results.  if
you have this on there, you might want to bypass it, as it could be
"starving" your carb until you get enough vacuum to activate this little
jewel...
>
>If you do all that and the problem is still there, gosh, I don't knnow.
Those motors are pretty simple, really.
>
>If I were closer I'd love to come by and check it out... I'm in the SF bay
area... and I suspect that (going by your Email address) you are in the
midwest?
>Just a guess, of course... but I have friends that worked at Unity Village,
and were in their ministry (ergo the guess).

>Please let me know if any of this helped, OK?
