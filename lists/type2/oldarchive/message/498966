   <pre>Hi folks,

We're back from another fun filled weekend in the 71 Westy.  On Friday I
looked at the MIG I posted about last week--it looked like a great deal so I
bought it (thanks to lister Mike West for his helpful advice).
Unfortunately I didn't have time to play with it since I was preparing to
leave for the weekend, so I packed my "new" toy away in the basement and
headed up to Lake George, NY.

My wife and I invited my mother and her dog "Scruffy" (who just LOVES VW
buses!) for a camping weekend to see the highlights of the Lake George
region.  My mother was aghast when I bought my first bus six years ago.  For
some reason she associated VW buses with Charles Manson.  She refered to my
old '70 Westy un-fondly as "the Charles Manson van" for quite awhile--that
is, until she realized how useful it was to have someone in the family with
a van that could carry large furniture, appliances, etc. (on a moment's
notice like a good son ;) ).  After that, and after a fun filled camping
trip to Saratoga Springs in the '70, she's been singing the praises of VW
vans and I haven't heard Charlie's name mentioned in awhile!  She even looks
for blumenvasens when she goes to flea markets!  I was taken aback when one
day she asked--"So Ron, do they make those buses with automatics?"  Wow,
mom's considering buying a bus--bus karma conquers all!

The drive to Lake George from Hartford is only about 4 hours (never kept
close track of the time, too much fun driving!).  The drive up was
uneventful aside from a peculiar toll booth incident.  An older woman in a
volvo wagon seemed to be taking awhile at the booth as I waited behind her.
When I pulled up to the booth to pay my $1.60, the toll guard said "No
charge!"  Huh?  I just said thanks and pulled away, quickly remembering
someone on the list who mentioned something about discounted toll charges a
few weeks ago.  I assumed this was just some "weekend special".  Then it
occured to me, maybe that woman in front of me paid my toll (saw something
on Oprah about some "random act of kindness" idea where you pay the toll for
the stranger behind you).  Geez, if I had thought quickly enough I could've
paid the toll for the person behind me and spread the good will along.
Well, I decided, I'll have to commit a random act of kindness on my way back
to set the karma in balance.  Feeling somewhat guilty and ashamed of my
"contribution" to the karma deficit and a little confused (normal state for
me), I continued on to the camp area.

Lake George is a touristy place--not for the cravings of a syncro owner who
wants to forge over unmapped mountains on the weekends--but good enough for
us and plenty of fresh air and water surrounded by scenic mountainside.  My
wife and my mother spent some time in the village area looking at a crafts
fair and through the "discount" tourist shops.  Scruffy and I walked around
the village and milled in areas where dogs were allowed.  I learned that
it's really easy to attract women when you have a cute little pooch as your
companion (how come nobody told me this before I married?!;) ).  Scruffy
(and me) were getting a lot of attention.  I kept worrying that Scruffy
would turn into psycho-dog (as he sometimes does) when some kind soul was
petting him.  He was probably having sensory overload from all the new
sights, sounds and people.  It was difficult to find a quiet spot within the
carnival-like atmosphere, so we eventually just picked a less travelled spot
and chatted with the many women who stopped to admire Scruffy.  Ahhh a dog's
life....

When we regrouped (Ron, why do you have that silly smile on your face?--Have
you been flirting? God, I can be read like a book!) we decided to visit the
historic attraction, Fort William Henry. The fort was built in 1755 and
burned down by the French and Indians two years later--not the best of track
records for a fort.  Scruffy was allowed in and it seemed like a quieter
alternative to the bustling village area.  The highlights of the tour were
demonstrations of British colonial-era weaponry (which we later learned
meant firecracker-simulated-grenade throwing, musket shooting and cannon
fire).  I should mention that my mother was insistent on keeping Scruffy by
our sides throughout the trip's activities and needless to say, he was a bit
frazzled after the military demonstrations with the cannon fire as a finale.
I decided it wasn't a good idea for kids to pet Scruffy under these trying
circumstances, lest they pull back a few less fingers after the musket went
off.  In all seriousness, covering his ears during the demonstrations helped
him along, and he seemed to take the activities of his crazy human
companions in stride.</pre>
