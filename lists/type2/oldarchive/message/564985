   <pre>Installing a bilge blower style booster fan in your
Buss heat ducting.

Having had more than a few inquiries about my turbod
heat I figured I would write it up for the tribe.
As with all things you will have to tinker around a
bit with this. The plumbing is not an exact science
and you will have to work with it. Also this is not
the end all installation. This is just what I have
done. This setup has been in place on my bus for
around 8 years or so. I am on my second fan ($15.00 at
a marine supply store). Dont use PVC (white) pipe as
it outgases when heated not good stuff. The ABS
(Black) is pretty stable at the temps you will be
subjecting it to. If you like the concept.. do it. If
you dont.. then dont do it.  :-)


First of all you need to install it as far forward as
possible due to the extreme heat that can be produced
by a bus heater system. ( I hear you laughing but its
true).
Use the black ABS sewer pipe to replace the stock
pipe.. if its even still there. I had someone tell me
their buss heater didnt work at all and when I took
a look under the bus there was no tube! (I digress)
  You have to go under your bus and measure the outlet
at the back of the bus to determine what size ABS pipe
you want to get. This will also allow you to assess
the condition of your overall heat ducting. While
under there have someone work the on/off control on
the dash. Check and make sure that the cables are
actually working the shutoff flaps located back by
your heat exchangers (the box looking thing next to
your valve covers). If not you have to fix this too.
Once you have the old pipe off and the new one in your
hands along with your bilge blower fan you will need
to cut a length that will carry the heat to the fan..
also you have to leave some room so you can cut a
short length for the other side of the fan. You can
assemble all of this on your bench to make it into one
single unit. I used a fan that was a larger diameter
than the ABS pipe so I got the step up adaptors also.
The large end of the adaptors will need a little work
to get a good fit on the fan. Oh yeah make sure you
are putting the fan in facing the right direction. 
     At the opposing ends of your new assembly will be
the interface points to your stock heater ducting. In
order to fit the ABS pipe into the stock ducting you
may have to do some tapering of the OD with a bastard
file. You only need 2 inches or so of the ABS pipe to
be inserted into the stock ducting at both ends. Now
you take an old coffee can or if your factory sponsor
is real generous you can buy a small roll of the thin
metal roof flashing material. Wrap this thin metal
sheeting around the pipe/ducting junction at both ends
and secure with hose clamps. This helps keep water
from the road out and also adds some structural
support at the ends. Wrap the fan itself in a chunk of
old inner tube rubber. This help keep the water out
and also keeps the thing from making direct contact
with the bus which tends to make it kind of loud.
(make sure the wires dont get wrapped up under the
rubber). Install it.
  IF your bus is a CAMPER all of the above wont work
as your bus has a belly pan and
You cant get a fan to fit under it. I found this out
the hard way, as I didnt know the Poptops have belly
pans though I did have fun while discovering this.
For a camper you will have to get a smaller diameter
fan that will fit in line with the smaller pipe that
is on the other side (forward ) of the box that is the
distribution box which allows you to switch tween heat
an defrost. This means the booster fan will only be
effective in the defrost setting. 
WIRING:
To power the booster fan.
  If your bus has the booster fan in the engine
compartment you can remove it and use the relay that
is there for it. Splice into the hot lead which used
to go to the old fan. Run the new wire through the
firewall where all of the other wires go through. Pull
enough wire to reach the fan plus a couple of inches.
I routed mine above the frame and misc. tubes under
the bus as much as possible and used tie wraps. Splice
into the hot side on the blower (see instructions that
came with it). For the other lead on the fan you may
have to add some wire length but you just need to get
a sheet metal screw and find or drill a hole to screw
it into. This sheet metal screw is your ground
connection. The relay that you are connected to is
operated by the built in switch on the heater lever
(all the way down position). Hopefully the fan in the
engine compartment was working so you know the system
is good. If the engine compartment fan was dead you
have no way of knowing if the existing electrical
system you have just tapped into is viable. If this is
your situation and when you turn the heat all the way
on your blower doesnt work you will need to make sure
the switch on the heater control is working . When you
pull the heat control all the way down it makes
contact with a raised bump at the bottom, which is
the connection. The contact on the arm and the bump
have to be making contact. Also there has to be a
ground connection hooked up to the stationary raised
bump. This bump is an obvious electrical connection
and is easy to find if you are a contortionist. Soooo
contact is being made and there is a brown wire hooked
to the backside of the bump. Good! Then the only thing
left is to check the relay. OH YEAH. The fan will work
only when the bus is running if you are using the
factory switch/relay set up. If the switch is
switching and the relay is relaying then the damn
thing should work.(voltage must be present too)
If you have an older bus that didnt come with the
booster fan setup then you will have to wire from
scratch. Which means installing a switch (toggle?) on
or under the dash somewhere. Find a switched (on with
the key only) voltage source on your fuse block and
wire it to the switch. Run a wire from the switch to
the relay you purchased.. and of course you bought the
relay socket.. right? You can see what you need at
this site.. http://www.partsexpress_dot_com/.
Search for the 12 VDC relay and up will come the 30
amp bosch. THIS is why you are using a relay. The fan
draws more current than you want to have sucked from
under your dash. So with the wire that you have
connected to your new toggle switch on your dash you
will wire to the relay activation pin on the relay. So
your activation voltage goes to
85 and you run 86 to ground. This energizes the coil
and pulls the contact shut on the normally open
contact which is number 87. So you run the wire from
your battery and
connect it to contact 30 and the run a wire from
contact 87 to the fans voltage in wire.
Frankly I would install the relay under the bus and
next to the fan in a housing (metal or plastic box).
Run your switch wire and the wire from your battery to
the relay.
  On both of these installations YOU HAVE TO INSTALL A
IN-LINE FUSE on the wire run from the battery. You
want to have this fuse fairly close to the connection
to the stock relay ckt or the battery depending on
what route you had to take. The in line fuse has to be
before the wire goes through the firewall.
If you need more info lemme know via p-mail.
If, god forbid, I had a brain fart while writing this
then point it out to me.. tnks
