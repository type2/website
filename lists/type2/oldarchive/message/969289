   <pre>I must be one of the lucky ones. In the last year I've rented a 26' truck, a
12' trlr, a 8'trlr and five tow dollies. Never an equipment problem and
always there when I've reserved them. Rented 'em on Vancouver Is,Oregon and
a bunch in Riverside SoCal. One thing that helps (so far) is to get them
from the company store, there a lot that are independent contractors
although in my case I've rented from both and not had a problem. Biggest
surprise was the last one when we discovered that they really didn't want
them to leave Calif. Paid 6x what I was used to, but didn't feel like
driving back to Oregon to pick one up. One thing to be aware of if you have
to cross the border, is U-Haul allows car carriers to cross the Canadian
border, Ryder doesn't and no one lets you cross the Mexican border with
their equipment.
