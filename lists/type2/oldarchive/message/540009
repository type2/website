   <br/>
   <pre>12/27-12/30
 I woke up the next morning and phoned the two sources for longblocks. One 
was in Raleigh - a T. Hoff a German who rebuilds upright engines himself 
and apparently did good work. The Second place was Hicks VW in Durham, which 
sold the Mexican longblocks. The prices were fairly close but the Hicks block 
came with a new oil cooler and though the price was a lot more than I could 
rebuild one for back home, I was in a jackpot and had to get out, so I 
ordered the Mexican block. I also purchase a new clutch plate and disc, two 
new heater boxes and a generator for good measure, plus a couple of odds and 
ends, including the heater accordian tubes. Christine wanted and needed heat 
and I was going to deliver. 
My friend Tony piled his wife and two kids into the rent a van and went to 
pick up the motor, unfortunately the guy who I dealt with on the phone was at 
lunch and somehow no one could take of me
until he returned so they waited. Meanwhile I waited, pacing and watching the 
sun. Talking to the guy who owned the motorcycle - turned out he was trapped 
too, waiting for a new transmission.
Finally they arrived at about 3pm - I had an hour and a half of sunlight at 
best. I needed to be somewhat 
social as these friends threw me a solid and hadnt seen me in six months, 
but at the same time I really needed to get this motor built and in the bus 
as quickly as I could. I worked as the little kids ran around  me and the 
tools and parts making me nervous but I kept at it, installing the clutch, 
pulley, shroud, oil cooler, heater box, intake and muffler combination. I 
decided to remove the flaps as I was heading south and really didnt need to 
worry about them getting stuck. After a while they left and I had the motor 
built.
It was now pitch black and getting cold again. I got the motor on the jack 
and offered it up to the transmission. working the jack with my foot, on my 
side guiding the motor bolts in, occasionally making adjustments to the 
scissor jack under the tranny. I tried for two hours getting frustrated. It 
wasnt going home. I tried the rocking horse winner - one hand on the fan 
housing one on the muffler, no good, I greased prodded poked raised and 
lowered but not good. I packed up washed up bought more fast food and ate 
dinner with Christine - considering that we could could begin to rot away 
from the food like Scotts men at the pole from lack of Vitamin C. But after 
another pep talk from Charlie who called for a progress report, a good nights 
sleep and a reflective ciggie and coffee - it occurred to me that the tranny 
should be in gear when installing the motor, I had made this mistake millions 
of times before - so I put it in gear and no it didnt quite go in, but 
enough so I could get the bottom nuts on it and tighten it in a bit, then the 
tops so it went in square, then the hookups and oil check now try it - turned 
the key, the starter motor began whirring merrily but no pop - of the 
turnover hmmm, now turning the key off but the starter continued to whirr, 
damn how did this happen quickly disconnect the battery. check all wiring - 
try again. same thing. Another problem was the generator belt they sold me 
was way too small. I used my old one and it was still too tight using all the 
shims. Called Hicks they claimed the battery was bad - it was a week old, and 
the starter was bad - it was three weeks old - but admittedly a motorola 
starter not a bosch. Anyway I had some discussion with The VW shop suggesting 
they come out and help but they said they didnt think so. I asked them to 
talk to the boss and give me a call back after talking to the boss - see if 
they could bring me out a new starter, belt and generator pulley, but I never 
heard from them again. Instead I went out and rent a car, which I should have 
considered 3 days earlier, drove down to Bunn & Son, which is a real nice 
outfit I highly recommend, I told the guy my story and he looked at me over 
his half glasses and said that 10,000 bug motors had been rebuild in this 
room in the 70s but he didnt have even one in stock these days. He did have 
a couple of vanagons around the lot. Anyway he accurately diagnosed a bad 
motorola starter which I confirmed by the screwdriver short test which also 
caused the starter to run on until I disconnected the battery, and the tight 
belt a result of a mismatched and tainted pulley. I dropped a small amount of 
money for a used bosch starter which was all he had, a new pulley, some shims 
and a new starter bushing. He also told to put my 009 back on the motor, for 
fear the biscuit went bad. Its a hotly debated issue and Ive always been 
all for the 009 but had recently tried the stock distributor and found it to 
work okay. But I felt safe with the trusty 009 in this case. I got back, 
switched on the  parts, the motor started and idle and ran beautifully. I 
returned the rental car and within an hour we were on 95 south trying to put 
Wilson NC in the rearview mirror. 
I wouldnt go above 50 or so and we drove that way for about 200 miles 
straight until my gas almost was gone and I was exhausted. We pulled into a 
motel in Summerton SC and had a good rest. The next day I did a quick check 
of the valves and again we had to jump on the highway and head south. The 
motor would just have to break in on the job. It was the 29th and the concert 
started on the 30th at 4pm. Didnt think I could make it but I upped my top 
speed to 55 for the second day and put about 550 more miles on 
the bus, making it to Jensen Beach Florida. Next morning, the morning of the 
show I really felt like changing the oil and rechecking the valves but I was 
parked in my in-laws driveway and it was the type of neighbhorhood that 
didnt have Vws and the driveway was the new kind that didnt have any oil 
stains on it so I prayed and started it up and headed down to Fort Lauderdale 
and then west on 595 for Alligator Alley to get to the show. On 595 west, 
maybe an hour from the show - it looked like we might make it and then I 
started hearing a high pitched noise - said to Christine do you hear that? 
She didnt said I was being paranoid. or maybe I convinced myself I was, but 
I hear a subtle change. It sounded to me like the circlip on my crosshaft was 
loose and somehow the throw out bearing was rubbing or about to unclip and 
throw itself around the inside of the bell housing. Well I said nah - weve 
suffered enough kept going then suddenly there was no more moving forward. 
the motor was still doing fine, we were still in the center lane of the 
highway, but when I shifted into any gear there was nothing there. I wrestled 
the bus to the exit and found a corporate parking lot to freak out in. I lost 
it for a few seconds. Told her it was the transmission and that was the end 
of the party. I got out and looked under and saw my driveshaft hanging. Oh, 
okay jacked the bus up got under there with my allen key and managed to 
reattach 5 of the 6 bolts, burned my foream on the heater box but didnt 
really feel it in my exuberence we jumped back in and went to leave but now 
it the motor wont catch - its as though its gasping for air, drowning 
until some violent gas pedal pumping clears its throat and gets it clear 
again. Keep going get close to the show. Get caught in traffic for two hours. 
The clutch starts jerking when I let it out. Its hot out - high 80s, tired, 
tire clutch tired driver somehow I make it into the show, park and we head 
in. Only missed the first set. good. First song they play in called Wilson 
I know it was for us</pre>
