   <br/>
   <pre>     This is in response to a thread started by drew_at_interport_dot_net who 
     spoke of problems with propane leaking out of his regulator.
     
     FIRST THINGS FIRST!
     
     If propane is leaking from the hole in the side of the regulator, go 
     shut that tank valve off NOW!!  Don't wait.  No sparks, no smoking, 
     etc. until the area has been ventilated for a while.
     
     I've been lurking here because it's an interesting list - - and I have 
     long range plans to acquire a Type II.  But I thought I ought to chime 
     in on this one.  My claim to expertise here is based on a previous 
     career as a distribution system and customer service engineer for a 
     large gas company - dealing with both propane and natural gas.
     
     Your propane regulator is a rather simple device.  It has a 2-piece 
     body - cast from what we used to call "pot metal."  In RV-type propane 
     regulators these two pieces are crimped together to form a 
     propane-tight seal - and they are, therefore, nonrepairable 
     throwaways.  In between the two body sections are the working parts - 
     a diaphragm (any number of different elastic materials have been 
     used), a spring (adjustable from the top of the regualtor), and a 
     valve with seat.  
     
     When you open your propane tank valve, propane rushes into one side of 
     the diaphragm, pushing it against the spring.  When the pressure in 
     this chamber is sufficient to overcome the spring tension, the valve 
     is pushed against the seat, closing off the flow of propane.  When you 
     turn on one of your propane appliances, pressure in this chamber 
     drops, the spring tension opens the valve, and propane is permitted to 
     flow thru to the appliance.  All regulator valves work this way, 
     though configurations and added features vary greatly. 
     
     If the spring tension is properly set, the pressure flowing through to 
     your appliances will be correct - usually around 6" W.C. (varies with 
     altitude, exact gas composition, other factors - consult your local 
     propane dealer - let him set the regulator if it needs it - unless you 
     have and know how to use a U-tube manometer). When the gas reaches 
     your appliance it flows through a small calibrated opening, or 
     orifice, in the burner assembly.  The orifice is sized to allow the 
     proper amount of propane to flow into the burner, assuming the 
     regulator pressure is correct.
     
     The small hole in the regulator body that Drew mentioned is known 
     (strangely enough) as the vent.  The vent permits air to flow in and 
     out of the side of the chamber opposite the side where the propane 
     resides.  This allows the regulator to have a full range of motion - 
     if there was no vent, the diaphragm could only move until the forces 
     exerted by propane pressure in one direction and spring tension + the 
     pressure from trapped air in the other direction equalized.  All 
     regulators have a vent on one side of the diaphragm (look at the one 
     on the side of your house, if you want) - except some exotic types 
     used for unusual purposes.  
     
     The vent serves a very useful additional purpose - it monitors the 
     condition of the diaphragm.  In Drew's case, propane leaking from the 
     vent means that the diapharagm has a hole in it - and the regulator is 
     no good.  With a hole in the diaphragm, adequate pressure control 
     cannot be maintained.  These things are designed to "fail safe" - and 
     nearly always do - but depending on the nature of the flaw and the 
     configuration of the regulator, it may be possible for excessive 
     pressure to get thru to your appliances.  When this happens, more gas 
     goes thru the orifice than the appliance was designed to handle.  In 
     case of a propane cabin heater, this means that the heater could 
     over-fire, burn out the combustion chamber or the exhaust ducting and 
     set your camper on fire.  I spent quite a bit of time investigating 
     gas explosions and fires - a variety of ugly scenarios come to mind.   
                     
     I strongly suggest that Drew should drive his camper down to the 
     (best, most professional) local propane or RV dealer to get a 
     replacement regulator.  While you're there, have them leak check the 
     distribution system as well as inspect the gas bottle - only takes a 
     few minutes.  Try to go early in the week when they're not rushed 
     trying to get everybody's stuff done in time for the weekend.  
     
     Propane is great stuff when used safely - here are some safety tips:
     
     - keep the tank valve closed except when you're using the propane    
       appliances.
     
     - propane is heavier than air - given the opportunity, it will push 
       the air out of low or enclosed spaces and wait for a spark or flame 
       to ignite it.
     
     - I know that some folks in real cold climates use propane cabin 
       heaters to keep warm while they're driving down the road.  This 
       practice, though nice and toasty, materially increases the chances 
       of a fire or explosion in the event of a collision.
     
     - Don't use anything but a properly installed, externally vented, 
       cabin heater to provide space heat.  Also - don't bypass any 
       safety's (overheat switches, sail switches, etc).
     
     - Keep your appliances clean - especially make sure that the burners 
       do not have plugged ports or anything other problems that will keep 
       them from operating properly.  (Just try getting that dry, cooked-on 
       pancake batter out of the stove burner - HAH! - try oven cleaner.) 
     
     - You should have your system leak-checked periodically, IAW mfr's 
       recommendations.  I strongly suggest that - before each camping 
       season - you should go over your system visually and with your nose, 
       and - especially - with a squirt bottle of soapy water (nice foamy 
       liquid dishsoap - like Ivory or Palmolive - mixed 10% with water 
       will do) or commercial leak-check liquid.  Turn the gas on and hit 
       each fitting with a squirt of the mixture - if bubbles start foaming 
       up, you've got a leak.  Fix it!
     
     - If you work on the copper tubing gas distribution system yourself, 
       use the proper tubing - Type K, I think, not the thinwall 
       refrigerator tubing.  Also use the flare type fittings - not the 
       compression type (Swagelock or equivalent).  The compression type    
       fittings don't stand up to engine and road vibration well, and 
       flaring tools, etc. are only a few bucks.  Also, it's real easy to  
       over-tighten compression fittings - if you do, you'll over-stress 
       the copper tubing - it will eventually crack and start leaking.     
     
     - If you have any doubt about what you're doing, consult a 
       professional and/or have them do the work.  Where propane appliances 
       are concerned, this may not be your FLVW or other automotive dealer. 
       Unless they are doing a helluva business in campers, they probably 
       haven't developed or hired the expertise.  Neither are you likely to 
       find professional help at your corner gas station where they sell 
       propane.  Try your major local bottled gas distributor (they guy who 
       wholesales propane to the corner gas station - look in the yellow 
       pages) or a major local RV dealership (ask your neighbor who keeps 
       blocking the street with his Winnebago).   
      
     - Don't park your camper in a garage or other enclosed space with the 
       propane tank valve open.  A leak here could blow up your house.  
       Scenario - You return from camping trip - park camper in garage 
       Sunday night but leave door open.  Monday morning - get in your 
       daily driver bug and head for work - and close the garage door with 
       your remote opener as you pull out of the driveway.  Propane leaks 
       out and begins to accumulate in garage.  Explosive mixture begins to 
       form. You return from work, hit remote switch as you drive into 
       driveway.  Bad contact in door opener sparks, igniting gas.  You 
       watch garage explode, remainder of house burn to ground.  
     
       Saw the results one time.  Fire investigators traced source of 
       explosion to propane leak on camper stored in garage.  Close the 
       valve!  Consider storing the propane tank outside. 
       
     - If you use your camper in late fall or winter (when you could get 
       snowed in), you'll be depending on your propane appliances for your 
       life.  Make sure you have enough propane and spares (regulator, 
       spare tank, tools, lamp mantles, matches etc.) to take care of your  
       needs and any problems.  (We once spent nearly a week snowed in      
       while elk hunting at about 10,000 ft in the Uinta mountains on the   
       Wyoming/Utah border - and were damned glad to have that extra tank   
       of propane and the extra box of matches.)  Also 
     
     - If you're going to be in the cold, have your bottles cold-weather 
       serviced by your propane dealer.  Tell him where you will be going 
       and what you will be doing, and he'll tell you if it is necessary.  
       The dealer will inject a small quantity of an antifreeze liquid 
       (usually methanol) into the bottle.  This absorbs water that may 
       have accumulated in the bottle due to moisture in the propane.  You  
       may have noticed frost on your bottle when it's being used - the 
       bottle gets cold because a significant amount of heat is required to 
       evaporate the propane.  If there is water inside your bottle and the 
       outside temperature is low, ice will form at the outlet of the 
       bottle and block the flow - similar to carburetor icing.  If this 
       happens, you will soon be very cold.  So get 'em serviced. 
     
     - Don't take a wrench out on the back porch and cannabilize the 
       regulator off your propane barby to use on your camper.  It may be 
       the model and size you need - - but maybe it won't be.  If it's too 
       small (possible if you're running a lot of propane appliances), it 
       won't provide enough propane - you may start losing pilot lights, 
       and the other appliances won't work at full capacity.  If it's too 
       large (not likely but possible), it will "short cycle," slamming on 
       and off under load - subjecting your propane appliances to surges of 
       pressure with undesireable long term wear, tear, and aggravation.
     
     And finally - -
     
     - If, heaven forbid, your camper catches on fire - GRAB the SO, GRAB 
       the kids, the dog, etc... and GET OUT and get clear!
     
       IMMEDIATELY!!
     
       These things burn to the ground in an amazingly short time - often   
       with spectacular explosions when the propane tank and the gas tank   
       go up.  Don't go up with 'em.
