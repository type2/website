   <h1>Germany trip report + oil cooler query</h1>

   <pre>John, et al, I got back from Germany visiting my Berlin based sister a
week ago, and drove enough in 14 days (in a Golf) for 6 tankfuls at like
80 marks per.  The Golf is pretty peppy (yes I was doing 160kph) and
steers nicely.  Did hit Wolfsburg, and visited Martin Peitz, who is on
this list and just moved back after 5 yrs in the States. I couldn't
believe his full collection of all VW manuals.  He bought a defunct
winery (buildings) and has lots of room to weld VW busses.   I saw about
2 bay busses, one splitty,  and lots of Vanagons (at least 2 an hour),
virtually all with high-tops.  The vacationers must dust off the
campers, for they were out in force visiting the north shore.  Drove
through Switzerland also, where there are van campers I never heard of
(Renault?).  I did take my tent, but at the value of the dollar, I could
stay in nice hotels with full breakfast for less than what the full
service campgrounds cost here! 
Bus  content- my high milage Westy has developed a significant leak that
looks like oil cooler- looking at a parter engine, it looks pretty tough
to do the cooler disengaging with engine in- has anyone done this and
can claim it was easier??   MB 78 Westy
