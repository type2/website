   <h1>YAEBTR (Yet Another EveryBus Trip Report) (Long)</h1>
   <b>David Schwarze &lt;sde_at_home_dot_com&gt;</b><br/>
   <i>2001-04-26 23:12:14+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>I've always tried to plan so that roadtrips in the bus involve as little 
preparation and teardown as possible.  The reason for this is that the 
memories of packing and preparing for days in advance to go camping then 
spending another day to clean everything up when we got home took a lot of 
the fun out of camping.  Unfortunately, everything broke down this time and 
we ended up working frantically for hours, up until the last minute, and 
even then I had to take off work early to get things done and we ended up 
leaving an hour late.  Part of this problem was brought on by the discovery 
of deep cracks in three of my four tires and the need to get them replaced 
within 48 hours - thanks again to everyone that contributed to that 
effort.  There were no tire-related failures on the trip!

We left Wednesday at 5pm with a full load.  Fridge full of food plus an 
extra case of assorted beverages, clothes for three people, bedding, 
folding chairs and table, and an arsenal of spare parts and tools including 
an extra cylinder head and driveshaft.  I have found that bringing a spare 
part seems to prevent that particular part from breaking, and I worry most 
about cylinder heads, so I always put one of those under the seat.  Filled 
up with gas at $1.61/gallon, highest price we paid on the whole trip I 
think, right in hometown Texas.  For a state with a lot of refineries, gas 
has gotten relatively expensive here.

As we headed towards the freeway Bonnie and I both noticed how quiet the 
bus was.  This was partly from the new tires (LT8.5x27x14C TrailFinders 
from Discount Tire) and I think partly from the Q-pads I installed last 
week.  Bought one box of them for $23 and put them on the forward-facing 
firewall which has very little "stuff" covering it in the Safare 
floorplan.  Since the search for a good alternative to Q-pads seems to have 
turned up nothing, I've decided to just buy a box every now and then so the 
price hit won't be so noticeable.  Coasting up to stoplights in neutral we 
could barely hear the engine anymore.  Very nice - I can't wait to stick on 
another box.  Once on the freeway, I noticed that the bus tended to wander 
more than before, not helped by the constant 10mph south wind.  We were 
headed NorthEast on I-30 towards Little Rock.  At the first stop I let the 
tires down from 40/45 to 36/42, which helped a bit.  The extra weight in 
the bus, much of it up in the highroof on the slide-out bed, probably 
didn't help.  Had to pay a bit more attention to trucks and road conditions 
than in the past.  Stayed near Little Rock, AK the first night - got up and 
on the road by 8:15am.  Picked up I-40 and cruised all the way through 
Tennessee.  Nice drive, especially the Eastern portion.  Made it within a 
few miles of Asheville where we stopped at a KOA and squeezed in between 
two 40+ ft motorhomes.  I usually don't stay in KOA's but this one was 
there when we needed it, had hot showers, and was "relatively" scenic.  We 
parked out front and walked up to the closed office, where the note said to 
grab an empty site and pay in the morning.  As we turned back towards the 
bus, a man drove hurriedly up and opened up the office so we could pay our 
$24 right then and there.  No doubt he figured we were a flight risk.

Friday morning we took our time with the remaining 250 miles, stopped and 
did some shopping, etc. and arrived at the park about 3pm.  Up until we 
entered the park, we hadn't seen a single other bus heading our way and 
were beginning to wonder if it was the right weekend.  :-)  We were 
relieved to finally see the Everybus signs pointing us towards the group 
camp area.  We were early enough to score one of the edge sites with 
electricity, which enabled me to plug in the very hip (I thought) 
Baywindow-shaped lamp that my lovely bride-to-be got me for Easter and 
leave it running all night.  Also a way to charge the batteries for the 
"Scruffy Huffy" E-bike.  Next to us was a 2001 Eurovan Winnebago camper 
with not one, but TWO tents!  On the other side of us was an early 'loaf 
with the Mystic (green, blue, gold, etc.) paint job... kewl!  Todd was 
quickly absorbed by the local gang of children who were having a blast 
riding bikes, playing on the open grass fields and in the suprisingly nice 
playground.  We met up with Ted Finesman, Poor Richard, David Raistrick, 
Steve Dolan, Mike Benthin, John Yost (sp?), Denmeister, and of course 
"ncbus" Chris the organizer, and many others whos names I can't recall at 
the moment.  Of all the campouts I have been to, this one seemed to have 
the highest percentage of listmembers present - a real who's who of the 
type2 list.

Some cool things about Everybus, in no particular order:

1)  The automagic bubble-making machine.  Sheer genious!  I want one.
2)  Ted's 100 proof cherries - what a way to make friends... with the floor!
3)  Chili cookoff - I only had room for 4 kinds and they were all awesome.
4)  Case burning - the biggest I have been to, but I missed the water 
balloon... drat!
5)  Kids games and prizes - The kid-friendly attitude made the campout a 
pleasure for all.
6)  Art show, puttputt golf, paddle boats and hiking trails - Lots to do at 
the park other than camp.
7)  Rob (of FMBC) giving me a full-color sales brochure for a blue Safare 
Custom Camper!!!  Whadda guy.
8)  The weather.  Partly cloudy, moderate temps, NO RAIN!  :)
9)  The nice people in the Class A motorhome who put up with our 
festivities and let us take pictures from their roof.
10)  Poor Richard's T-shirts, which we were lucky enough to score two of 
when we arrived.
11)  H. Steve Dolan for carting around my transaxle for 9 months.  I owe ya.
12)  Chris for putting this whole thing together.  I owe you too.
13)  Winning the long distance award.  :)
14)  My lovely fiance Bonnie for enduring the 2,200 mile trip with me.</pre>
