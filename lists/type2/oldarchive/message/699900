   <pre>Here's an artical that ran in a recent issue of "The Transporter"  Enjoy!

                                   TRANSPORTERS BY THE TUNNEL

     In the beginning the Universe was created.
     This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a
bad move. But in 1950 a man invented something called a Volkswagen Type II
Microbus and the world became a better place.
     On July 21st and continuing until July 23rd 1995 over 35 of these
beloved Microbuses, in their many varieties, gathered together for a
weekend of fun and relaxation.
     I'm Jim Digennaro, my wife Barbra and I have been running this event
for two years now.  In case you don't know what Transporters By the Tunnel
is, let me explain.  Located in the city of North Adams is the Hoosac
Tunnel, a rail tunnel, about 5 miles long.  Not to far from the tunnel is a
great little campground named Historic Valley Campground. Closer that you
think is Mt. Greylock; Massachusetts highest point.  In 1994 I
thought,'what a great place for a VW campout weekend'.  Being a LiMBO
officer I persuaded the club to lay out some cash to get things rolling.
Thats why its listed as a 'LiMBO sponsored campout'.  Of course everyone is
invited to come out and have some fun either for the weekend, one night or
just the day. Last year we had about 15 VW's.  This year we had over 35
VW's, and next year hopefully the turnout will be even better.
     We arrived Friday afternoon, under cloudy skies, about 1pm.  We were
pleased to find Jon Hill and his family, had made the trip from Arkron Ohio
on Thursday had been enjoying the area all day.
     While setting up we encountered rain, of course. After the brief
shower the weather cleared and the rest of the weekend weather was great.
     While the rest of the afternoon breezed by my family and I set up camp
made a fire and welcomed new arrivals.  Some of the many happy campers to
make their way to our little get together on Friday, beside Jon hill, was
Steve Paine in his 93 Euro, Scott snider in his beautiful green 77 camper,
Rodger and Nancy Welch in their 79 camper, you might know this nice couple,
they have a heater and an A/C unit mounted in the rear window.  Nevin
Letcher and his wife made the trip in their 91 camper,  Erwin Goldstien and
his wife arrived early Friday in their nicely equipped 90 Westy.  LiMBO
officer Mike Guilfoil and family and President Stan with Ben got in late
Friday.  There were so many people I could take up the entire page. I'd
like to thank everyone for coming and I hope to see them all next year.
     Evening rolled in and site 57 was hopping with people.  Some cooking
themselves a quick bit to eat on the barbecue, others enjoying the campfire
and conversation, and everyone was having a good time.
     More people arrived until late and one show up about 1am.  Grant
Rutland of Toronto showed up in his new, loaner, Euro-Van Winabago.
While Grant made the long trek from Canada, he was not the only ones to
come from the Great White North.  A couple of nice guys, sorry I forgot
their names, were on an extended vacation from Ontario with their 62
hardtop deluxe.  My hates off to those guys.  Just goes to show the
dependably of a Volkswagen.  The longest distance traveled goes to Jon Hill
and family.  While actual mileage was not tallied, Ohio seams just a wee
bit farther.  Maybe next year I'll give an award for longest distance.
     Morning arrived, as it always does, with the familiar sound of those
sliding doors.  My father was nice enough to pick-up a few dozen fresh
Nevilles Do-nuts, and I brewed a fresh pot of java.  It's the best part of
waking up!
     Most of the day Saturday was spent relaxing.  The warm weather was
great for hanging out at the beach.  The water was nice and warm and clean.
About 2pm we got together for a nature hike to the Hoosac Tunnel.  I had
hope to see a train run though the tunnel but no luck. Funny thing was we
waited for an hour then after we got back from out hike 3 trains ran
though. Next year I'll get the train schedule.
     Saturday night we gathered together again on site 57 for a pot luck
supper.  What a feast!  Salads, rolls, hot and cold foods, fruit salad, a
great stew made by my new friend and 'fire starter' Thomas O'shawnasee, and
a lot more edibles than I can remember.  There was this one dish, kielbasa
with barbecue sauce and cranberries, yum.  We finished off with some
birthday cake my mother made for my wifes birthday, happy b-day Barbra.
Surprise!
     After dinner we gathered around the fire place and swapped VW stories
and other interesting tid bits.  I remember seeing the faces of Mark and
Lesley Henabre, Al Zimmerman, Cornlieous Mead, George Alexander, Thomas
O'shawnasee, and the late but never misses a outing Dale Ward.  I guess
we're luck to see Dale at all, I understand he, Steve Paine, and Mike
Guilfoil got separated for the rest of the group during our hike and lost
there way.  They did make it back for dinner.
     As the embers burn away so did the the group.  I saw a lot of
campfires burning in other sites.  I guess 1am was to early to go to bed.
These are the times I'll never forget.  Good friends,old and new,
the young and the old, together having a good time all bound together by a
common tie, Volkswagen.    I bet those Detroit guys don't have this much
fun.
     Sunday morning, sausage and pancake breakfast.  We seemed to have
enough for everyone, though next year I've got to get back my big frying
pan.
      Everyone packed-up and a few people left early.  Some wanted to catch
a few of the sites before heading home and some had a long trip ahead of
them.  They unfortunately didn't get a chance to see the top of Mt Greylock
with us. The view was less than breathtaking , a lot of haze shrouded our
view.  It still is a cool place, 3291 feet up.
     A quick bite to eat and we said our goodbye's.  I hope everyone had a
good time.  I'd like to thank everyone for coming.  I remember everyone's
face but not always their name.  I would like to thank my father for the
Do-nuts and mother bringing the cake. Steve for helping me set up and break
down.  Thomas and Erwin who helped cook breakfast.  I can't forget my
beautiful bride who puts up with all this, without her I wouldn't be half
as organized.  My kids, Derek, Angela, and even little Dylan who helped out
by just being good.
     Well anyway enough of my rambling. It was a great time and I'm
planning to do it again next year.  Thanks again to everyone that came out,
I hope you'll do it again. And to everyone else we'll see you, hopefully,
next year.  We'll try to make 96 even better.
