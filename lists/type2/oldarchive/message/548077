   <h1>Trip Report: Stewart BC/Hyder AK</h1>
   <b>Eddiehintz_at_AOL.COM</b><br/>
   <i>1996-08-12 01:57:37+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>Hey now,
     Yesterday, 8 August, we finally made it to Alaska! Sort of. 
     We split from the main group at Boya Lake, and headed for Stewart with
Jack Stafford and Bob Hoover. It was a long haul down the Cassiar highway,
but scenic as always. Lots of forest, and lakes everywhere. We finally saw a
fair amount of snow on the peaks, which was bordered by mist, above and
below. The whole thing looked like something out of the movies. It was the
sort of thing that Samantha really loves, so maybe someday she & I can come
back and do it together...
    We shot off the Cassiar and headed for Stewart, and pulled into town
after taking a look at the Forest Service campsite (Clements lake). The site
was rather spartan, so we thought we'd check around town for other options,
and we wanted a seafood dinner anyway-Bob had been talking about it for
several days at that point...   ;-)
     We gassed up in Stewart, and found out that there's no customs station
between Hyder AK and Stewart BC, and rejoiced. After our bad experience first
entering into Canada, we had figured we'd better cross the border in Jack's
bus, so I was very happy to go into AK in my own bus. We got into Hyder, and
had a very good Halibut & Chips dinner, for a resonable price-about $7
american. But we paid in Canadian-the primary currency of Hyder AK! While
Hyder, pop. 95, is offically in AK, there are no American banks, so the
primary currency is Canadian. However, there's no sales or property tax, and
you can buy things like pepper spray (illegal in Canada) since it's Alaska.
Kind of wierd. All the kids in Hyder attend school in Stewart, the power is
from BC Hydro, and it has a Canadian Area Code. Kind of odd place.
     After dinner, my dad & I went to go look at the bears. There's a US
Forest Service bear observation area just 5 minutes outside of Hyder, manned
by US personnel and everything-sure was nice to see those uniforms again.
There's this creek that the Salmon swim up to spawn, it's only a foot or 2
deep at that point, and the bears just walk in, scoop up a Salmon, and chow
down. It was really neat to watch the bears from such close quarters (about
10 feet at the closest point), and the bears didn't really care, as they had
lots of fish to eat. There were 3 Forest Service guys around with pepper
spray in case the bears got too agressive, but the fellow I talked to said
they'd only used the stuff 4 or so times this year. It was fun to watch the
bears in a natural setting, knowing that they wouldn't be a threat. There was
one smaller black bear that kept getting chased away by this big Grizzly, it
was really fun to watch. The black would sidle down to the creek and start
looking for fish, the Grizzly would tolerate it for a while, then the Grizzly
would start chasing the black, which would of course run like hell. They went
almost a quater of a mile down the road at one point...
     While we watched bears, Bob & Jack had some bear troubles of their
own-the RCMP(Royal Canadian Mounted Police). Seems that the mounties were
waiting on the AK border for us, and they followed Bob & Jack for a while.
Typical police intimidation, it was much like a small town in the deep south.
When Bob & Jack enquired at the local campgrounds, they were suddenly all
full-never mind the empty spaces visible. The guy came running out when they
pulled up saying "too late! too late!", Bob said "Too late for what, sir?"
and he said "We're all sold out, you'll have to leave." So Jack headed back
for the Forest Service site, while Bob waited for us to come back. And the
cops did the usual
drive-by-steely-eyed-intimidating-I'm-gonna-bust-you-hippie-scum glare, and
then parked on a side street where they could watch Bob. Pretty lousy. Last
time I checked there were no laws-Canadian or otherwise-against being a
tourist.
     We headed out to the campsite out of town, and Jorge joined up with us
there, and the bunch of us camped there. The mounties drove by to check it
out later that evening, but they left us alone. I guess the local kids heard
all the talk about hippies invading town, 'cause they came out around
midnight and partied for a little bit-undoubtably hoping the hippies would
come sell them dope or something. They left after it became obvious that we
were only going to sleep. So I have to say that all the talk about how nice
Canadians are is false, from my experience. They're just like everyone else,
most of them nice-but with a few idiots and jerks here and there. Same as it
ever was...
     So now it's down to Bob Hoover and us. Jorge and Jack have remained
behind, as they will catch the BC Ferry in a few days, and the rest of the
group-Tobin, Neil, and Pete-are a day behind Jorge and Jack. Bob & I have
picked up the pace as I will pick up Samantha at the Seattle airport on
Monday. Indra and I are both looking forward to the reunion with Sam. Me more
than Indra I think...
     Southward Ho!!!    ;-)
Peace,
Eddie</pre>
