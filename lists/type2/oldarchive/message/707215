   <pre>Actually, I took it to the local VW shop, the bolts were rusted together so
I knew it would be a REAL pain to get it apart with my still limited (but
getting larger by the week) tool supply. You guys might want to get a
mechanic opinion before you jump in. The local VW shop has gotten so much
business from me (oil seal repair, tires) that they don't even charge me
for a quick "put it on the lift to see what's up". They only charged me 1
hr _at_ $34 per. Cheapest I've seen for a mechanic anywhere. I guess they
figure they will always get you on the parts, but I had my own, which they
didn't seem to mind. In fact, they were very curious as to where I got
them, seems that they like to sell the off-brand parts when they can
too,...
