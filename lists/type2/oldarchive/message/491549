   <pre>Well volks, I'm going to give this rather lengthy description in the 
form of the good, the bad, and the ugly.  whooo whee whoo, duh dah 
duuummmmmm.

THE GOOD
'82 full westy, somewhere around 85k I'm guessing, the car is with it's 
co-owner.  I got it at 72k, it had Steve's old Mark Stephens engine in 
it till about 78k, a stock 2.0 rebuild since.  So rebuilt 2.0 (by me) 
about 5-10k ago, new hand painted P&C set, new lifters, reground cam, 
my best set of 25k mile heads with 3 angle job new intake and exhausts, 
hand lapped, perfect crank, rebuilt rods, all components match to under 
+/- 0.5gm, all chanbers matched to +/- 1cc with 7.5:1 CR exactly.  
Haven't taken compression recently should turn 110-130 on all I'd 
guess.  Absolutely perfect interior with exception noted below, best 
original striped upholstery I've ever seen, canvas mint, new top seal, 
all camper stuff perfect, hardly used.  Fridge overhauled with slick 
cooler fan installed hard wired with switch in stock panel will keep an 
honest 40F+ drop, lights instantly, will not blow out at interstate 
speed, also functions as well as ever on 12/110V.  Propane tank 
beadblasted, painted white.  New front suspension bushings on upper 
A-arms (I had em from the '81), new upper ball joints, new front 
rotors, bearings, seals.  PERFECTLY FUNCTIONING BA-6 GAS HEATER but 
with new heater boxes, flex tubes, flapper valves (didn't need it, I 
had it, a couple old sets of boxes included if you like and I still 
have them) you don't neeed to use the BA-6 until it gets about 45F 
outside.  New fuel lines all round, chances are I replaced all the 
grommets on the tank as well, I don't recall.  Added VDO oil temp gage 
seamlessly installed in dash pod, looks great.  CV's repacked with new 
boots and I'm sure replaced if any looked bad, again I don't recall.  
Two filler doors for water/electric replaced with nice used, all close 
nicely.  New water pump in tank.

THE BAD
auto transmission, not that this auto is bad, it is as good as ever, 
just that isn't very good on an air cooled van.  See my tirades on why 
the auto doesn't cool and doesn't work say in WV.  The auto is a mixed 
bag though, off the line the torque multiplication makes it a bit 
peppier, but on a long drawn grade when you are direct you lose.  This 
van is just fine to drive around the metro DC area where it is now, on 
the beltway you can cruise 65mph just fine, but come west and try to 
climb the mountains (such that they are) into WV and you are crawling 
in 2 at 40mph.  Regardless it shifts smoothly, ATF/filter replaced, 
then filter changed and ATF re-replaced 5k later (my normal policy.)  
I'll add in bad in regard to the AT, the van now has an aux oil cooler 
(96 plate style) installed nicely tucked in rear left.  Before install 
on long hard grades or summer interstate driving oil temps could reach 
275-280 briefly, now stapled down in 220-230 range, depends how fast 
you want to drive.  Needs a small electric fan installed so it works 
while van is in stop and go city driving as well, I may look for one in 
a yard I saw some nice Nissan radiator fans.  Interior wise only 
problem is 1 foot long crack in sliding door panel which is off car as 
the stupid clips for it are like $.90 each.  I kept looking for a dark 
brown panel to match the front, I've had 3 lined up but no-one would 
ship em for me, stock one looks fine if you want to pay for the clips.  
Van has A/C installed, yeah an overheating by nature air cooled 3 ton 
van with A/C, I WILL NOT SELL THE VAN WITH THE A/C.  The first engine 
in this van made it 65k miles, the second made it only another 7k.  The 
A/C will be removed in total, with tin replaced with normal tin, and a 
matching closet door reinstalled on the rear compartment but it will 
still have the grille cut in the back of the cabinet.  Sorry volks but 
it isn't smart to have, adds weight, and frankly I want it for 
something else (water cooled.)  Radiator isn't very good at the moment, 
I have a mostly fair crossover pipe with the U rusted out.  I have 
ordered a mandrel bent U to replace it but will no longer have the EGR 
port and the gas sampling port obviously.  There are no EGR components 
present anyway and the holes are blocked as that is where I put the oil 
cooler lines through the tin.  Anyway crossover has original cat, brand 
new OEM muffler and tail pipe.  Should be able to run it or just buy a 
1 piece if you can get away with it.  Tires, at the moment a mixed bag. 
 I can inlude either of two options.  Option 1 you get 4 27x8.5R14 
Wilderness AT's (yeah the ones that blew up when stupid Ford drivers 
underinflated em, but not in this size) on nice steel rims with stock 
caps.  About 50% left, look very spiffy, THE HANDS DOWN BEST TIRE I'VE 
EVER PUT ON A VAN, except not on this air cooled van.  Slows it down 
even more, sort of.  Thing is that although they make you downshift to 
2 sooner, you are going to anyway and you can hold a higher speed in 2 
than you could.  And they look real tough, C loaders, etc.  Or two non 
reinforced 205 Michelins on steel rims and two who knows what I got 
non-reinforced tires.  I drive non-reinforced on Vanagons all the time 
(gasps of horror...)  Anyway I'd go with the big boys, they sure do 
look cool and their grip is phenomenal dry, wet, snow, whatever.

THE UGLY
Well this van is generally quite nice for a mid-atlantic van, but.... 
Of course it had some seam rust, fairly minor but I went and tinkered 
and I broke my own irrevocable rule.  I had scraped the rusty seams 
portions with custom scraper, sandblasted, got done on Saturday 
afternoon to find I was out of PPG DP-40 and 3M seam sealer, and of 
course had to do it, right now.  So I used cheap primer and Autozone 
seam sealer.  Two years later the rust is same as it was.  This isn't 
bad by any means, much better than most.  At the time I repainted the 
entire nose as well because of road debris nicks, it is still perfect, 
no rust at all on any front seams (like above the bumper where they go) 
 Color match even though I did the PPG computer match is only fair, and 
many areas of the bus have been overbuffed and show tiny spots of 
primer here and there.  I'm being overcritical here, from 20 feet this 
bus looks fine when waxed up, but frankly I'd go ahead and just bite 
the bullet and do a full repaint when you fix the seam rust.  That is 
about it for ugly.

THE EXTRAS (maybe)
Extra auto tranny out of an '87, will work fine just has an ATF cooler 
that won't be hooked to anything, or hell buy a brand new one and hook 
it with a little recirculator pump to the water storage tank!!!  (hot 
water, give it a thought)  This tranny 110k mile ran perfect, I parted 
the van.  Extra front dark brown door panels, perfect don't need em, 
just happen to have em.  Extra alternator.  As many extra brown 
interior bits as I can find off the '81 signal switches, column cover, 
who knows what.  Very nice '90 front grille and square headlight system 
(bolt in) including the factory wiring harness if you ask nicely and I 
go pull it included for an extra $150.  The square high beams are 
unreal good, the lows are superior to regular sealed beam rounds, and 
are superior to halogen rounds if you buy high wattage bulbs (only 
stock included.)  Oh it has halogen sealed beam rounds at the moment 
with a replaced front grille that doesn't have the chrome strip.

Well thats about it.  The co-owner of this (don't ask, my best friend) 
just bought a mint '65 Corvair Monza vert and the van has to go, I'm 
driving the '77 and don't need it and it isn't WV compatible except for 
I-79.  This is a nice van, we are the third owners from new, and the 
second owner only drove it for 3 months before blowing the second 
engine cause he drove it 70-80mph.  This van is wonderful for the 
flatlander who seldom travels the hills, with the aux oil cooler it 
does not overheat but it is still just dog slow.  The van is now in Pax 
River, MD but will be returing to Morgantown, WV for some minor fixes 
before we sell it.  Steve Dolan has seen the van (intimately he took me 
up with an engine to swap into it when we picked it up) and can likely 
attest to its condition.</pre>
