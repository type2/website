   <h1>Northern California Vacation</h1>
   <b>stafford_at_alcor.hac_dot_com (Jack Stafford)</b><br/>
   <i>1995-08-28 21:04:18+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>  Left Costa Mesa on Sunday morning, the 13th.  Headed through L.A.
and up the coast on highway 101.  Stopped in Solvang for lunch with
a bunch of other tourists, then on to Paso Robles.  From  there I
drove San Luis Obispo county road G14 to Lake Nacimiento.
  The lake is a man-made reservoir and was very full.  The upper
parking lots and boat launching ramps were under water.  Launching
a boat was challenging due to the minimal incline at the remaining
ramps.  Dry rolling hills with oak trees surround the cool water.
I slept on the living room floor at my friend's house the first night
and in the camper parked in the driveway the next two.  We're supposed
to be camping here, right??  :-)  In the middle of the night, three
deer, two racoons and a possum rummaged through the trash cans in the
driveway.  Seems that these animals are tame enough that the neighbors
hand feed them.  The locals also cautioned me that the bobcats are out
at night.  My idea of sleeping on the banks of the lake was nixed.
  A couple days later I drove to the Pacific Coast Highway - 1 via
the G14 and G16 through the Fort Jolon Hunter military base.  
There are some really nice campgrounds along here, right next to a
stream.  Make mental note to return someday.  It was very steep and 
windy for the last 10 miles to the beach.  My brakes were fading and 
stunk so I stopped for an hour to let them cool.  
  I drove across that bridge in the car commercials and blasting 
Steely Dan's greatest hits on the stereo.  It was about 4pm when I got
to the Monterrey Bay Aquarium.  They're open to 6 and I got to see it
all.  They're opening some new exibits in the near future.  My friend
Ted said they've been saying this for a year now.  After seeing all the
fish at the aquarium whetted my appitite for seafood dinner.
  Once in Santa Cruz I took highway 9 to Felton.  The day use area of
Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park had a sign - CAMPGROUND FULL.  As
always, I drove to the campground entrance just to see for myself.
I got the last campspace, #72.  The next couple days I hiked around
on the many trails in this area to the sound of the Roaring Camp train
blowing it's horn.  Never got into the city of Santa Cruz, though.
  Took the 17 east to San Jose and north on the 101 to San Francisco.
I tried to follow the tourist signs to fisherman's wharf, but I must
have missed a turn and ended up lost near Golden Gate park.  Somehow
I found Market street and the Embarcadero...at least I got to see some
of the city.  Had more seafood and then drove on the 101 north across
the Golden Gate to Marin county.
  The folks I was travelling with wanted to get a hotel for the night
in Novato.  The hot tub and cable tv were nice, but we're supposed to
be camping here, right?? :-)  Everyone got cleaned up real good, filled
the ice chest at the ice machine and hit the 101 north in the morning.
  Made a stop in Hopland at the Fetzer winery and the Mendocino Brewing 
Company.  I didn't drink but a few tastes of wine and looked at the menu
at the microbrewery.  They used to grow hops here, now it's mostly vineyards.
The end of the line was Clam Beach campground just north of Arcata.  My
friends Ted and Dave slept on the sand in the parking lot.  In the morning
Ted flicked a huge beetle off him and Dave had a flock of birds around him.
  The Humboldt Brewing Company has a mean grilled chicken sandwitch with lots
of grilled onions and GARLIC.  I had to put the fire out with some of their
draft Red Nectar Ale.  I asked them "Where's the lager?"  they only brew ale.
This is an old brewery in Arcata, it's been there since the 1800s.
  I set out to find a more "civilized" campground because of the other two
in our party.  Mother and daughter aged 28 and 2 respectively. I found the
Eureka KOA and we made this our home base so they would have all the amenities.
It seems this place is a real haven for the fifth-wheel type travel trailer.
I thought it was rediculous that the campers get away from it all, yet bring
it all with them.  I didn't like it, so I went out on my own for a couple days.
  Trinidad had some real nice views and beaches.  This was "roadside" camping
and perfect for the Westy.  I went south to the Avenue of the Giants.  It's
a road that parallels the 101 for about 20 miles just north of Garberville.
The main attraction there is the largest living thing on the planet - redwood
trees.  Some of the stumps are 8 feet across and the estimated age of these 
are > 2,000 years.  I bought a slab for a coffee table as a souvenir.
They take a redwood stump and slice it like bologna.  My slice is about 4 
inches thick and about 4 feet in diameter.
  I drove to Garberville and headed west toward Shelter Cove.  This is the
way to Wailaki campground in the Kings Range Conservation Area.  I was hoping
to meet up with the vanagon_at_lenti folks on the weekend.  I never did.  I did
stay at Wailaki and was eyeing space #13 at the far end.  There's a black
cat that's a resident of the campground.  I took this as a portent and stayed
in space #12 instead.  Everything was going so well that I didn't want any bad
luck to screw things up.  It paid off.
  The road down to Shelter Cove was winding and steep.  Some of the switchbacks
forced me into second gear...uphill and down (to keep the brakes cool.)  I got
to the beach and scrambled around on the rocks and tidepools.  There were a
couple grizzly looking seals sunning themselves on the rocks.  This area is
really out of the way and I could see why the northern coastline is nicknamed
"The Lost Coast".
  Once I got back up to Eureka I phoned Martha (busgirl_at_netcom_dot_com) to give
her the first-hand report on Wailaki.  I left a message that may have helped
some of you find the place/set the expectations.  Sorry I missed y'all and I
hope to meet up another time and place.
  By Friday morning, the 25th, my friends were eager to return home.  My friend,
Dave, had registered at Humboldt State Univ. and needed to pack his stuff in
Costa Mesa and then drive back to Arcata for classes on Monday.  We balled the
jack all the way through to Costa Mesa.  He followed me in his Suburban from noon
'till about 3:30am.  I could swear I saw Scott Harvey's vanagon with a
bike rack along the 101 just south of Garberville.  Whoever it was waved back
to me.  There was alot of delays along the 101 for repaving and a detour
due to a rock slide.  I figured that taking the 101 home would be much cooler
than the I-5 from Redding to Sacramento.  It was in the 90s in the San Joaquin
valley when it was in the high 70s on the 101.  My motor never ran hot.
  I fixed my sun visor (thanks D.Schwartze), my windshield washer, the side
fold out table and changed my oil.  It's nice to return home with more things
working than when you left.  The highest price paid for 91 octane unleaded
gas was $2.15/gallon in Lucia on highway 1.  The lowest price was $1.39/gallon
at Laytonville on the 101.  My gas mileage fluctuated from 12 mpg in the coastal
mountains near Shelter Cove and 21 mpg on I-5 from Los Banos to Grapevine.
227,000+ miles and still going strong.
