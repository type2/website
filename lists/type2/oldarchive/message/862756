   <h1>No such thing as a free bus! (pickup report, long)</h1>
   <b>"Jay Ollom" <jaytype2(-at-)hotmail.com></b><br/>

   <br/>
   <pre>This is basically a trip/free bus pickup report, so feel free to move on if 
that's not your thing.

     Well, this Sunday my girlfriend and I hitched up a two wheel tow dolly 
to her Isuzu and headed out to Brian's place to pick up the 71 "FREE BUS" 
you may have seen on the list.  I have now decided that there is no such 
thing as a truly free bus.

Either the owner, or the bus, is going to make you PAY :-)

     We got to where the bus was a good hour early (Brian's good friend 
Eric's place).  As we were traveling the last 20 miles or so, we fell in 
behind this nice camper, which of course turned out to be Brian heading out 
to where the bus was setting.  Getting there an hour early gave us the 
opportunity to chat busses and astronomy for a while I helped out pulling 
some of the parts he wanted to keep off of his bus.  Brian's a pretty net 
guy, and sharp as a tack.  The bus is chock full of Bondo, but I was happy 
to see most of the camper interior still in it and in good shape.
     Anyway, the real fun began when we tried to load it up onto the dolly.  
We decided that, since the driveway was on a slope, it would be better to 
park the tow dolly facing down hill and roll the bus down with gravity 
helping onto the dolly.  Despite this advantage, we still had to push pretty 
hard to get the bus up the tow dolly ramps.  This probably would have been 
just fine IF, we had been smart enough to put somebody IN the bus to operate 
the brakes!!!!  That's right folks, the bus actually went up onto the tow 
dolly... then right off the front side hitting the rear bumper of my 
girlfriends Isuzu!  Now we have a tow dolly stuck in the middle of the bus, 
and a VERY PI$$ED girlfriend!  We worked for two hours trying to get that 
dang thing out from under the bus, with pretty much everything on hand.  We 
tried pulling it forward over the dolly, but the tongue got stuck on the 
front beam.  We tried pulling it out sideways, but the fenders were too high 
on the tow dolly to slide it under the bus and they could not be removed.  
Then we removed the wheels on the dolly to make it lower.  This helped, but 
eventually we ended up using a set of car ramps to bring the bus front 
wheels back up and over the front of the tow dolly, with the bus being 
pulled by a car.  We got the bus back on the tow dolly using an come-along 
(nice and slowly) without incident.  The tow dolly thing was dealt with, but 
I am still dealing with the girlfriend :-))  Actually she's a pretty good 
sport about the whole thing, but she is still pretty miffed with me 
(understandably I think).
     Anyway, our next stop was Marcus Schaper's place.  Had a little trouble 
finding it, but we got there.  He wanted to asses the bus for possibly 
pulling some parts he needed, or possibly as a restoration candidate.  We 
both agreed that with the amount "Structural Bondo" (this term comes to me 
from Brian, BRILLIANT!), that it just wasn't a good basis for a resto.  So, 
Marcus got the doors, and wanted to two decent passenger tires off of the 
bus, which were nearly new so worth saving despite the lack of a C rating.  
He ended up fighting for two hours with two of the lug-nuts that had 
obviously been put on with an impact wrench on HIGH.  An angle grinder, cold 
chisel, and sledge hammer were eventually employed to convince those lug 
nuts to come off.  Man, Marcus is one dedicated dude.  In this case, he was 
paying for HIS free parts!
     The rest of the trip was basically without incident.  After getting up 
at 5AM to head out and get this bus, and dealing with all the snags along 
the way, I had the moral of my story.  I truly don't think there is such a 
thing as a free bus.  One way or the other, you are going to pay.  I am very 
thankful for the opportunity that Brian presented me with though, and I 
still think it was well worth all of it.

Lessons learned:
No such thing as a free bus
Put a winch on your tow dolly, don't just push things on
Have somebody in the bus to operate the brakes, just in case
