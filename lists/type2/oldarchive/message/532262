   <h1>Brake affecting idle? Also my idle problems.. </h1>
   <b>&quot;Janice Bartmess&quot; &lt;sbaypetinn_at_tailwag_dot_com&gt;</b><br/>

   <pre>Brake servo (booster), hose and valve notes..
Someone had posted something a little while back now about a wierd problem
with their brakes, that the idle and the braking system seemed to be
interacting, or affecting each other. I think that they said that the pedal
height would change with increase/decrease in engine RPM.
I just wanted to point out that there is a valve in the brake vacuum hose that
is potentially going to cause problems if it is not installed correctly. This
valve sits right inline with the brake vacuum hose and looks like a black
round cannister, maybe in profile as big as a quarter. That is the '71
version, anyway. There are only two ways to install it, and one is wrong.
Well, this is a one-direction valve, so if it is turned the wrong way, your
power brakes are not going to work (it will still brake, but hard pedal), and
it could affect the idle or rpm, especially if the servo or the hose between
the booster (booster) and the engine compartment had a leak, even slight. The
direction is marked on the little valve, but apparently some people don't
check and put it in the wrong way.
When you reinstall that valve, it might be a good idea to cut back the hose a
bit to get into some good "live" rubber, and use a couple of hose clamps. The
hose has a metal thread in it, so use some good cutters.
The valve should be installed in the engine compartment, for ease of access
and to prevent interaction of idle with excess air volume which might remain
in the line.
I had to mention this, because the bus that we brought back from Couer d'
Alene had so many things that were not done right, which apparently caused the
engine to fail and prior to that probably made it operate badly. We can now
add this one to the list. We haven't been using it much, but we did drive it
all the way back to Los Angeles from Couer d' Alene after putting in the
rebuilt engine, and used it around town. We have gone through it a little more
as time allowed, and it's getting better and better. Recently we have had a
problem with the idle after warmup.. In checking for vacuum leaks, we found
this problem with the wrong-way valve. I knew that the brake servo was not
working, but I sort of assumed it needed a rebuild. Now it works great! We had
a good laugh over this one!
Other problems found, and recent problem with idle..
The original blown engine that was in this bus had a broken crank.. busted
right in two! Amazingly, someone drove it into the sales yard up there, making
a heck of a racket. It also had a broken bell housing on the transmission,
apparently from a rather cataclysmic and sudden event that resulted in a
massive amount of torque being applied to that housing.. But then, the '71
does not have a lot of support in the mounting system to control and dampen
torque. Anyway, you get the idea.. And when we got into the engine, both the
oil pressure relief valve and the oil pressure control valves were completely
disabled.. the plungers were totally gone! The engine had also been installed
in such a way that the big rubber gasket that is supposed to keep hot air out
of the engine compartment was kind of sticking up in the air uselessly..lots
of daylight between the exhaust and engine areas, and I recently found a very
tell-tale piece of obviously ancient, brittle, and shredded generator/fan belt
in a recess of the engine compartment. It's really amazing, that these
vehicles and their engines can tell their story, isn't it?
In checking things out, I found a little hole in the heat riser on the
manifold that had been eaten through.. now hot exhaust gases are getting
directly into the engine comparment, and that won't do. So, this must be
changed, but it would not affect idle.
The carburetor is less than a year old, but we're changing it out to the one
that came with the C d' A engine, just to maybe eliminate that. The new one
just doesn't seem to adjust! Cannot get this thing to idle, or even to hold a
steady rpm. Any ideas, anyone? Has anyone ever had a problem with a new
carburetor like that? I did find one potential small vacuum leak in a 1" piece
of fuel line with a metal dowel that had been used to close off a vacuum port
on the carb.. It was old and possibly cracked, but that has been fixed.
Because of the recent problems that we had with bad fuel on another engine, we
drained all the gas and put in new, also drained the fuel bowl in the carb.
The other '71 bus was running VERY badly, backfiring, not idling, etc.. We got
it running, drove it home. It ran just fine when the fuel was drained and
changed. The bad fuel came from a "World Oil" station, the newly reblended 91
Octane Union Oil product that they were dispensing.. Visual inspections
revealed several suspicious symptoms that all was not right.. a clear
substrate that was heavier than the fuel and settled out into a layer on the
bottom of the sample jar, particulates, and a general cloudiness when the fuel
sample was allowed to stand in contact with air. The clear substrate did test
positive for water with one brand of test paste, and not with another!!!
The carburetor that I am using on the bus I'm having problems with now is a
Solex 34 PICT 3, and I have checked the electromagnetic idle valve and cleaned
out the passage from the outside with a little can of compressed air (the kind
with the long, red wand that they use for office), and also the pilot valve
and idle and fuel adjustment valves. I've gone through the Bentley's carb
adjustment procedure for that model a few times, but cannot achieve any kind
of a free-standing idle once the choke (warm up) throttle opens up and lets
air into the carb. RPM cannot be adjusted with any consistent and sensible
results, measuring with a digital tachometer. The fuel filter has also been
changed, although it didn't really need it.
Any thoughts?
