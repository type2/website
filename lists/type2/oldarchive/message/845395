   <b>ChaMoon <standingbearz(-at-)yahoo.com></b><br/>
   <i>2004-11-13 13:29:19+00</i><br/>
   <br/>
   <pre>ok heres what i think 
cause i am out of ideas also we have fixed all sorts of things.
It has had a slick fan belt for quiet sometime before i bought the dual carbs and put on it.
When i would go to adjust the valves and try to turn the bolt on the alternator i would have to physically grab the belt by hand as i turned the bolt to get it to turn and then sometimes i like on the 180 i could turn the motor with just the wrench.
"Reason"= the oil was slick on the belt causing it to slide when turning the bolt.
No friction .........
i never noticed the oil dripping under the bus till later on but dont think it was till after the duals got put on?
it has always had a qaurter size drip coming from the tranny and engine where they were mated even though we used all new seals. That was fine by me and is a normal spot for a tiny drip as that and she is just marking her spot.
The small drip that started under the fan housing on the ground i never could locate though; the one that was making fan belt slick and causing the oil drip under the fan housing armor.
 
Well when the duals were put on the engine was run real hot that day trying to adjust the linkage and my fears is this is what could of made the rings etc... go bad?causing blowby?
there again was the oil already blowing out of the dipstick hole slightly? causing the slick fan belt and wetness there in the belly of the fan armor?
the overheating of the engine must of made it worse?(duals installed that day)
 
thing is the oil spliage this bad didnt start till i decided i no longer wanted to run the duals
they gave me a fit and i didnt have the power i needed so michael mentions the power loss i had and thats true i just couldnt get them right and someone else mentioned about the jet sizes.???? hmmm the duals made me appreciate a weber but thats just me call me lazy if you will i call it being simple.(grins)
 
so i took them off and have traded a friend for another weber but in the meantime i am borrowing the carb off the club engine in order to puut putt round town for work and other thing trying to make to money and then school pick up and drop off and such.

back Before Taking The Duals Off i went to help a friend in need broken down on his and her way to Fire On the Mountain campoutFMBC
 
i noticed when i got there which is 45 minute drive or more and almost in phils back yard.(he was at FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN)
was a normal day to me and didnt race the bus there never get on her she's my baby and i treat her right nice and slow (SLOW VEHICLE=PASS WITH CAUTION)reads across the back  bumper in  large 4 inch letters ... {{{{{no joke go around bung hole head should of left ealrier or as expected as much(YOURE BEHIND A 76 VW BUS 55 stay alive)!
 
{{{{{ok so thats the first notice that i had lost a great deal of oil}}}}}}}(it was all over the ground under the bus) since rebuild motor wasnt using oil at all except maybe every 500 miles i would put a drop in her 1/4 of a qaurt had the same qaurt for awhile.
 
i got home and cleaned her up and put about a half qaurt maybe a little less than half qaurt>?close....
ok so the leak went to minimal for a bit afterwards?
 
then the leak came back again?
phil drove up  we messed with the oil filler cap and it stopped leaking like that and a few other things as well.
made sure everything was right and readjusted timing again.
(anything you remember we did here i forgot to mention phil?)
 
the leak started back and was chunking up some oil and phil came back up last week and we did compression test and everything turned out good.
we also replaced the oil sender on the top of the crank case and plugged off the oil dipstick hole with a piece of gas line and bolt.
 
the  leak stopped.
after a day of driving it::: i was bound and determined to figure this out.
i didnt want to have to carry my dipstick around with me it needed to be in the shoot and why is it coming out of the dipstick and how do i fix it now?????
 
so i cleaned the oil breather soaking it in gasoline for 3 hours shaking it every 15 minutes of three hours.
all sorts of black junk came out of it each time i shook it.
 
i blew through it and had lots of air coming through even soaked the top pvc valve with it  and off of it unattached made sure it was cleaned out.
dried and put back on bus sealed up good and still oil everywhere>?
i can see it running down under the metal tube from the dipstick. A actual stream of oil under the tube and it is flowing from there to down in the belly of the fan armor and tin and out onto the ground.
 
ok so i take a piece of gas line and attach it on there and then take a piece of gas line that is as big as the biggest round part that stops the dipstick from going in the tube its's self.
it seals it up tight fit and it bottoms out on the metal tube and gives accurate oil reaind on the level line, buttttttttttt when i go take my daughter to school and come back home the smell of oil lubricates the air in the carport as i exit and i look and yep same spot its the size of a soda can already??? dark black oil and i open the hatch to see where its coming from since it was all cleaned up before hand.
you can see the oil streaks on the new gas line to seal off the dipstick looks like the barrel of a firecracker once blow up but yet with oil. and its dripping from the alternator end again and all over the back side of the tin foam seal and in the belly of the tin under the fan armor.
 
then i came to my wits and have parked her till i can get a new/ used oil breather to try my luck in case its my oil breather thats messed up or still clogged.
If that doesnt work i will get a leak down test kit maybe got to check around today for a price on one so more than likely that will have to wait.
If for any reason that happens i may have to borrow the club engine??? once again to stay rolling till i can get mine right?
 
wont take long to take mine out and that one back in,.
 
Only if it comes to that though.
The oil worries me that shes speaking to me and saying shes sick somewheres?
to why she does it sometimes and not all the time but most of the time is a mystery>?
 
so its down to a peanut butter jar trick
then new oil breather
next  leak down test
if fails rebuild with new parts?
 
hoping i can stop at first two 
hope it doesnt make it to the leak down test.
 
thanks you all for help and overabundance in emails and support was awesome.
so this is where i am right now didnt have a chance to do much last night and wont have the chance today might be able to finally look at it again monday got some things to do today as well as tomorrow but at least going to try the peanut butter jar somewheres today or tomorrow when i take a break.
after that going to see if i can find a oil bretaher somewhere?
 
then its off to seeing about a leak down test.
 
i really hope this ends up being somethig stupid i am overlooking and something as simple as a small hole in the oil filler tube side or needing a new dipstick or the oil breather or something not so costly times are what they are and that means like a ROck.
yep things that tuff right now.
keep you all updated and thanks for the replies 
wish luck arg*&^&^matey
peace and love
