<PRE>Hey Kevin,

I have a '78 CEII and had the same broken wire and same intermittent horn
action. For the contact in the steering wheel that contacts the horn
button, I ended up using copper tape maybe one eighth of an inch across.
I'm pretty sure you can find the stuff on Amazon.
I first tried to bend the contact up slightly in the hump or the middle so
that it would make better contact but that didn't seem to work but wrapping
it in a very small amount of copper tape worked a treat. If you go this
route, make sure the copper tape you buy has electrical properties, as in,
it can pass an electrical current.

Good luck to you. When I eventually tackle my heat (not really needed in S.
FL) I'm going to look back on your descriptions and successes for guidance.

-Patrick

In for a penny in for a pound...here is an update:

I started going through the duct work in the back of the bus. At the
booster fan - removed these ducts - great airflow through here. Shoved my
vacuum through where ducts go into engine tin to see if anything came up
-but all seemed clear.

Next stop heater control flap boxes. The driver side heater cable appeared
to be adjusted as tight as possible - i.e. the end of the cable was pulled
as far through the barrel nut as possible. The other side looked like I
could possibly adjust a little bit. Maybe 1/8&quot;. But I figured I should give
it a try. Of course the bolt snapped when removing. That was fun trying to
drill out. Hopefully I have an extra barrel nut clamp thing in my part
stash. Found one.

I ended up removing the top of the heater box - I think this is called the
heater box control flap - I decided to do this on both sides while at it.
This took a bit of work, but figured it was a good time to take it apart,
address any leaks, put some anti-seize on this stuff, throw some paint on
any rusty parts. Everything was relatively solid - but some surface rust.

On the passenger side the seal was the original asbestos seal, on the
passenger side it was replaced with an orange silicone boot. Both in good
shape - but while I've got this apart, I think I'll replace that asbestos
seal. The PO gave me a box of parts - and I found a grey version of the
orange seal. Part number 111-819-945, or 819-945-73 74. This is going to go
on - now what to do with old asbestos seal?

I've done a quick cleanup of these boxes, and some master series silver
primer, and black chassis undercoat.

I've checked airflow at forward end of heater box - and it feels pretty
good. Not as strong as at booster fan, but there must be some loss right?

Ok - just waiting for paint to dry on heat control flapper boxes, then I'll
re-assemble and see what I get for air flow at each junction.

Thanks for listening, and for all your tips.

Ok - while waiting for paint to dry on the heater box flaps - I figure I
might as well address a horn issue.

My horn worked intermittently for a week or so before I started addressing
all these other issues. I looked underneath, and saw a short ground wire at
base of steering column. This wire was broken. I just replaced wire -
underneath the bus, I used the same bolt, above the floor I used the bolt
that is 180 degrees from the original bolt that was used, as it was a lot
easier to get to. I put some anti-seize on the bolts when I put the thing
back together.

As far as bolts - I'm referring to the 4 bolts at the base of the steering
column that go through the steering coupler. I picked two bolts next to
each other.

Horn not working.

I checked wire under button on steering wheel - it is in good shape.

If I ground the horn directly (is put a short wire between horn ground and
touch the body, I get a honk). Which connection is messed up?

Thanks for any guidance.

Asbestos is not such a big deal to dispose of. Always handle it wet so the
dust does not become airborne. Soak it with a garden sprayer or spray
bottle and water and dish soap. Seal it in a baggie and put in the land
fill. If you have a truckload (like roofing tiles) the landfill here would
take it but put it in a separate place.
This might not be the law, but for small amounts, my advice is protect
yourself and your household.

Just took for a test drive - horn works intermittently, I think related to
where steering wheel is. I think there is a contact point under steering
wheel - this could be worn out, or dirty, or turnsignal needs to be
adjusted closer to steering wheel.

I'm calling it quits for today. Will be doing clean up tomorrow...and will
post updates.

Last update before calling it quits tonight...

Got all heater box flaps reinstalled. Driver side heater cable was TOO
long, that was one of the problems. I had to cut the end of the wire, and
put the clamp on the wire instead of the thick piece at the end of the
wire. Passenger side was probably ok before, but I've tightened it up a bit.

Now all cables/lever work properly. I get heat in the right spots with the
right amount of power. Although I think it would be nicer if the booster
fan were quieter and also more powerful...;)

I think I can take it for a bit more driving around tomorrow, and maybe
even a road trip to NH on Wednesday...depending on how tomorrow goes, and
weather reports for NH. If they are getting any snow, I'll leave it here in
Boston. Thanks for your help in troubleshooting...I'll keep you posted on
how it all goes. I think I'll get in in shape just in time to put it away
for the winter ;)

Did you get the one-way flaps on the engine fan housing and also on the
booster fan? The engine fan will over run the booster fan at highway
speeds, so you could just get by without it, but it is only actuated by
full right setting on the temp lever.

Both things happen. Usually the brass wiper has worn thru in 100k miles. or
it is not sitting close enough.

Call Tim Taylor to find out how to boost that blower power. Maybe rewind

Cheers,
Chris
