<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Interesting talk with my dad today, which brings to light my thoughts on the Facet pump reliability and then on good ole bay L-jet reliability, despite the woes and diagnostic tips recently expounded here.&#160; I have got to say, in experience with probably 30+ bays, 15+ Vanagons, 6-7 Eurovans, I'll take good ole L-jet in a bay or Vanagon, even a 35 year old setup&#160;over anything else&#160;VW has since put in a transporter, except maybe for an IDI diesel, or a 30-PICT, but I do want some power and all.
&#160;
This is brought home by the conversation with dad.&#160; '95 EVC, I bought this van front end wrecked at 48k, 1 owner miles, had sat about a year, put it back together over 4-5 years, dad has ran it for about 8-10 years now.&#160; Irregularly over the last few.&#160; Over the couple years it initially sat while I tinkered away at the bodywork, the fuel pump had died, all the injectors in the rail seized, all had to be replaced when I put it back together.&#160; Dad used it a lot 5-6 years ago but has diligently started it every 1-2 months, driven it around the block, but hasn't really used it in 3-4 years while he has worked on his new house.&#160; He goes to let my sister borrow it, drives poorly, he tosses VAG-COM on it, but can't find anything obvious in a quick look, takes it to his mechanic, who notes a number of ECU sensors very&#160;intermittently coming and going.&#160; So the guy is messing with the ECU connector when he notes the entire ECU is PULSATING !!!&#160; He pulls it
 open and the ECU is FULL OF GASOLINE !!!&#160; The fuel pressure regulator is attached to the ECU MAP sensor with a T into the manifold, and&#160;had failed and filled the ECU with gas, and was spurting gas into the manifold, with the manifold vacuum pulsations pulsing the walls of the ECU.&#160; Still ran though in its defense, poorly but ran, electronics submerged in gasoline and all.&#160; They dried it out, dad pulled a MAP sensor off a spare '93 ECU to repair the '95 only model, they replaced the regulator and fixed, sort of.&#160; 
&#160;
Now I've had 1 L-jet regulator fail in my life, and it just failed to high ring pressure, diaphragm didn't rupture, didn't really matter much, ran rich but ran.&#160; I mean the EVC is to me still a newish car, it still has under 70k miles on it and the entire fuel delivery system has failed.&#160; I've bought L-jet bays that haven't run in 15 years, fired em, drove em home, replaced the fuel lines just for safety and put 50k more on them without investing a cent.&#160; From VW the EV fuel pump is over $400, the injectors over $200 each (though back in the day I replaced all with stuff from parter vans.)
&#160;
Other EVC&#160;things dying from 3-4 years of sitting, the ridiculously large pressure lift cylinders for the roof, a no longer available custom sized skylight vent that the Vanagon skylight guy never bothered to repop since so few people bought EVCs, the rear hatch lift cylinders, and a thermostat to open the cooling vanes on the radiator fan shroud, that costs, get this $56, and of course 3 others on parter shrouds I had sitting around (dry garage storage) all shot as well.&#160; Just from sitting.&#160; Spring hatch in a bay doesn't go bad, manpower powered roof lift frame doesn't go bad, who needs a stinking skylight vent, and hell T4 thermostats, well, um, err, let's not talk about those.
&#160;
1.9 Waterboxer injection is cursed by grounding issues, 2.1's are cursed by ECUs with cold solder joints, D-jet was well, just a bit too complex for its day, yet the air cooled bay and Vanagon L-jet soldiers on.&#160; Clean up all the connections on your harness and repair any heat damaged wires, and it will run when it is 50 years old.
&#160;
I am right now sorely tempted by a '96 Rialta for sale for $3500 up here in AK, engine died overheated because the Winnebago side of the conversion sprung a coolant leak in the ridiculous unplated, unpainted (and of course NLA)&#160;mild steel piping they ran back to a rear heater and coolant/domestic hot water, water heater (itself not a great idea IMHO when running ethylene glycol.)&#160; Had Winnebago just ran coolant hose all the way, it would still be fine.&#160; I am of course the only one in AK that happens to have a low mile EVC 5 cylinder mill sitting in my garage gathering dust, but the thought scares me because even if I got a better deal than it already is, and having the engine at hand, I could easily be $2000 into the fuel and cooling system, and who knows what else.&#160; So although it kills me I'm letting it pass.&#160; Plus the layout is dismal, seats 3 driving, but sleeps only 2 in separate twin beds.&#160; I guess just the thing if you are living in the
 1950's without a kid...
&#160;
Anyway, if weather isn't torrential downpour, we'll take the '77 out this weekend, for last weekend of the summer.&#160; I'll check the tires, top off the tank, fill the water tank, and I'm sure drive it several hundred uneventful miles even though the fuel lines are 8-9 years old at this point, as are the tires (oh my, oh me.)&#160;&#160;Although we've only had it out once at the beginning of what was a busy working&#160;summer I'm sure it&#160;will start, run, go wherever we decide, with a canoe strapped on the roof, with no complaint.&#160; Just like it always does.
&#160;
I'll lazily put off doing the fuel ring one more year, and think about restoring the A/C to operation again, eyeing Ron's Sanden compressor conversion mount, since we may end up back down in the 48 next year.&#160; I will finally install the retractor front belts my wife bought from BD last Christmas as somehow the drivers side fixed belt seemed to have shrunk terribly, so I had to install it as a 3 point for the 6yo in the back, and my cobbled together Vanagon retractor system didn't look so nice even if it was dirt cheap.&#160; Seems like the rearward adjustment on the drivers seat has gone to hell, and the steering wheel has gotten larger as well, I might have to look into those issues as well.
&#160;
Anyway have fun all.&#160; L-jet forever.
&#160;
John
