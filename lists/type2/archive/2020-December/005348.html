</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Midnight Repairs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He came down the back drive just before midnight on Christmas Eve.  I was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out in the shop, about to call it a night when I heard the unmistakable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sound of a Volkswagen running on three cylinders.  Bad valve.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It was an early model high-roof delivery van.  Bright red with white trim.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He pulled up behind the shop.  As he shut down the engine it made that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unmistakable tinny rattle of a dropped valve seat.  Good thing he shut it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> off when he did.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There was a barber pole logo painted on the door:  &quot;NicEx&quot;  A young
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> old-guy jumped out, came toward me offering his hand.  He was wearing a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> snowmobile suit, red &amp; white like the van.  I could smell the engine.  It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was running 'way too hot.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Fred Dremmer,&quot; he said.  We shook.  He was about my age, mebbe a little
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more, but young, if you know what I mean - alive.  Phony beard though.  It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was his own but too shiny and perfectly white to be natural.  I eyed the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get-up he was wearing, took another gander at the door.  &quot;Nice ex?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;NICK ex,&quot; he corrected me.  &quot;I've got the franchise for this area.&quot;  He
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> looked around, noted the tumbledown appearance of the shop, victim of an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> earthquake that never happened, thanks to politics.  &quot;Are you still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> building engines?&quot; he asked.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Not so's you'd notice.&quot;   It was pushing on toward midnight and colder
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than a well- diggers knee.  His shoulders slumped down.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;But you used to build engines,&quot; he said hopefully.  I didn't deny it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;They said you offered a lifetime warranty.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Actually, I didn't offer ANY warranty.  Most of the engines I built were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> high- output big- bore strokers.  A firecracker doesn't carry any warranty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> either.  And for the same reason.  But if I built it, I promised to fix it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if they could get it back to the shop.  And if the problem was my fault,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there was never any charge.   So I told him, &quot;Something like that.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;My van has one of your engines,&quot; he said.  &quot;In fact, I think all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> franchisees use them.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;This I gotta see,&quot; I laughed.  He ran around to get the church-key but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd popped the engine hatch with my pocketknife by the time he got back.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> twisted on my mini-maglite and sure enough, there was 'HVX' stamped right
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where I'd stamped it.  It was one of the lower numbers, a bone stock 1600
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd built back in the seventies.  Big sigh.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Can't you fix it?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I gave him a look and he shut up.  It had just gone midnight, clear and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cold and silent. The on-shore flow had increased, bringing with it the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> charred smell of disaster.  About a mile to the west of me a family's house
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> had caught fire and burned to the ground only hours before.  Merry
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Christmas indeed.   I straightened up, knees creaking, and went to fetch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the floor jack.  As I moved away from the vehicle the guy got all excited,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plucked at my arm.  &quot;Really, it's very important... &quot;  I snarled something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appropriate and he let me go, stood like a dejected lump in his idiotic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outfit.  He brightened up when I came back towing the floor jack, a pair of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> jackstands in my other hand.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;You're going to fix it?&quot;  If he was a puppy he would have been licking my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> face.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Nope.  You got a bad valve.&quot;  I got the jack under the tranny support and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> started pumping.   &quot;Which ain't my fault, by the way.  I built this engine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nearly thirty years ago. You've gotten your money's worth and then some.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I got the jackstands under the torsion bar housing, went around and chocked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the front wheels.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;I wasn't complaining... &quot;  he began.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Well I was,&quot; I shut him off.  Veedub valves don't last thirty years,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> especially when they're pushing a van around.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;It always ran perfectly.&quot;  His tone was placating.  And it was Christmas
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Eve. Or rather, 0015 Christmas Day.  &quot;And it never gets driven very much,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or so I was told.&quot; I gave a snort of disgust.  Thirty years is thirty years
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and every salesman always sez the thing was only used to take the family to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> church on Sundays.  I got a tarp and my small tool bag, rolled the tarp out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> under the back of the high-roof, dug out my head lamp, checked the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> batteries.  Dead, of course.  Began taking the battery case apart.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Need some batteries?&quot;  He was right there, offering me a 4-pak of new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ray-O- Vac's. Right size, too.  I put the thing back together, tested it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;What are you doing, exactly.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Swapping engines,&quot; I grunted.  I handed him a ratchet with a 13mm socket
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and pointed at the rear apron bolts.  &quot;Whip'em outta there.  And don't lose
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the washers.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I skivvied under and got the surprise of my life.  The thing was CLEAN.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As in showroom new.  No road rash.  No oily residue.  Original factory axle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> boots so clean and new they gave a tiny squeak when I touched them.  But no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> heater ducts.  In fact, no heat exchangers, which explained why the guy was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wearing a snowsuit.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Does this mean I can finish my route?&quot;  He was bent over, peering at me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> upside down.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Not unless you get those damn bolts out, it don't.&quot;   I was running my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hand over the paintwork.  It had been treated with some sort of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> surfactant.  It felt oily smooth but left no residue on my fingers and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> didn't seem to attract dirt.  There were steel rails re-enforcing the frame
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on each side.  They ran as far aft as the bumper mount.  I couldn't tell
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how far forward they went.  &quot;You do all this?&quot; I shouted as I crimped-off
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the fuel line.  The breast tin had one of my early bulkhead fittings, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ones I made out of brass before discovering lamp parts worked just as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well.  I popped off the hose.  No dribble but I plugged it anyway.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;I don't maintain the vehicle,&quot; the fellow shouted back.  &quot;They do all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that at headquarters. What should I do with the bolts?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Put them in your pocket.&quot;  I skivvied back out, popped loose the battery
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ground strap, removed the rear apron, disconnected the electrics and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> removed the barrel nut holding the accelerator wire.  I gave it to him.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Keep this with them.&quot;  I put the little plywood pallet on the floor jack,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> got it positioned under the engine, jacked it up and pulled that puppy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outta there.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Fred Dremmer was impressed.  He even told me so.  &quot;I'm impressed,&quot; he
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> said. Then he said &quot;Happy Christmas.&quot;  It was 0030 and I was tired.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Balance that,&quot; I told him, tapping the top of the blower housing.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grabbed the handle of the jack and used it as a trolley to pull the engine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into the shop.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He stood looking around while I dug the spare engine out from under the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bench. It was already on a scooter.  &quot;What happened?&quot; he asked softly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Look down,&quot; I snarled.  &quot;You'll figure it out.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He looked down, toed the gaping crack that ran across the floor like a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lightning bolt, saw the way the shop was sloping.  &quot;Earthquake?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Northridge.  Popped the foundation like a pane of glass.&quot;  I pulled the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> engine out into the open, keeping it on the level part of the floor.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Don't they offer special loans... &quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Only if you're in the 'official' earthquake zone,&quot; I laughed.  He started
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making apologetic sounds.  &quot;Balance that,&quot; I told him.  We scootered the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spare engine out of the shop.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I had to swap mufflers.  His came away okay, thanks to the lavish amounts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of anti-seize someone had swabbed on the fittings.  It was one of those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lifetime stainless steel bus mufflers from Germany or England or some damn
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> place.  Cost the earth.  He looked around, sat down on the workbench when I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nodded toward it.  We were out back of the shop, under the shed roof.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Plenty of light.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;So what are you getting for Christmas,&quot; he asked, smiling.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I just looked at him, shook my head.  I work best without an audience.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;You want some coffee or something?  This is going to take me a few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> minutes.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He said No; he had a thermos of tea in the van.  &quot;Seriously, what do you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want for Christmas?&quot; he smiled.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Not being pestered in the middle of the night would be nice,&quot; I muttered.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He just laughed, as if I was joking.  &quot;Seriously,&quot; he said again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;You want 'seriously'?   Howabout a new house for those folks down the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hill?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He gave me a blank look and I realized he didn't know about the fire.  So
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I told him.  He ended up looking as sad as I felt.  &quot;What do you think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they'd like for Christmas?&quot;  I goaded him.  I shook my head, &quot;It's mostly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bullshit anyway.  A birthday party that's gotten outta hand.&quot;  And the best
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evidence of that was right there in front of me, some yuppie asshole
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yuletide delivery service running around on Christmas Eve in an antique
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bus. He stood gazing off toward where the fire was.  It had been a huge
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> blaze, you could see it good from the house.  Hopes and dreams and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Christmas trees are all highly combustible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I finished transferring the J-tubes and muffler to the spare engine and he
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> helped me shift it on to the jack.  We pulled it out to his bus and I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> started putting it in.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;It's unusual to find someone who doesn't want anything for Christmas,&quot; he
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> said.  I'd given him a pair of vise grips to hold.  I didn't need them but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I figured it would make him feel useful, mebbe shut him up.  Wrong.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;I've got everything I want.&quot;  I'd checked the splines.  Things were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lining up good.  His seals looked new.  I gave them a spray of glycerin so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they wouldn't grab the engine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;That's even more unusual,&quot; he said.  He was smiling, acting a little
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> antsy but working hard to keep me happy so he could get the hell out of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there.  About the worst thing that could happen to him would be for me to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slow down.  So I did.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;People spend too much time wishing for things they don't need.&quot;  I patted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the red high- roof.  &quot;I'll bet this thing is chock full of yuppie junk,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eh?&quot;    He looked uncomfortable, passed the pair of vise grips from hand to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hand.  &quot;And what about you?  I'll bet you're some sort of retired
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> executive, working a little Christmas-time tax dodge to supplement your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> retirement, eh?  Bleached beard with a platinum rinse, funny suit and this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> oh-so-cute Santa's Helper delivery van, popping up in the middle of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> night to trade on an implied warranty almost thirty years old?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;What are you saying?&quot;  He looked kinda angry.  The sight was as silly as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> his costume.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;You wouldn't understand,&quot; I sighed.  I fished the throttle wire thru the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> blower housing, plugged the engine back in, started the upper nuts and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shanghaied him into holding the wrench while I skivvied back under.  Did
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the nuts, torqued to spec, did  the fuel line, checked things over,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> skivvied back out.  With everything installed underneath, I began putting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the engine compartment to rights.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;You mean the religious aspect,&quot; he said.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;You heard about that, eh?&quot;  I kept working.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Are you a religious man?&quot; he asked softly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was connecting the generator leads.  I wanted to ignore him but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> couldn't. I stopped, rocked back so I could see his face.  &quot;Yeah,&quot; I told
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> him.  &quot;I'm religious as hell.  And so are you.  But the difference is you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worship money and I don't.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;And you can tell all that just by working on my van?&quot;  He was smiling.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He was no longer angry but really cheerful.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Yeah, I can.  You've had some sort of anti-stick powder-coating process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applied to the whole undercarriage.  That must of set you back some major
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bucks.  But it's not a car- show kinda van otherwise it would be all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> original underneath.  That tells me you did it so you could impress your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> customers with your shiny, never dirty ride and THAT tells me you probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> charge some big bucks for your Christmas Eve delivery service gig.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That wiped the grin off his face.  &quot;Very astute,&quot; he muttered.  Then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frowned. &quot;But if you knew it was all just another Christmas-biz scheme, why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are we standing out here in the middle of the night while you repair the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> engine?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I laughed at him.  &quot;See?  I said you wouldn't understand.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I finished the hook-ups, connected the battery, replaced the rear apron,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connected the throttle wire, wiped everything down.  &quot;Go run the starter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for a minute.  We gotta prime the carb.&quot;  He clumped around to the front
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and got in.  I hadn't noticed the boots until then.  Or the buckles.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ridiculous.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I held the throttle open while he ran the starter.  He held it down for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about thirty seconds then came clumping back.  &quot;Won't it start?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;It'll start.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Shall I do it some more?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Not right now.&quot;  I sat there, loaded a pipe, got it going.  He turned out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be a pipe man too.  Some foreign smelling crap.  I've got Prince Albert
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the can.  I mentioned that fact but he didn't get the joke.  Or mebbe he
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> did.  It was about a quarter after one.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;What are we waiting for?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;For the starter to cool.  It'll start now.&quot;  And it did.  Nice steady
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idle.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I took his credit card and driver's license, did the paper work.  He
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> balanced the clipboard on the steering wheel, signed both slips without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> question.  &quot;This is just a deposit,&quot; I explained.  &quot;Bring back my engine,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you can tear it up.&quot;  But right then I had a premonition I wouldn't see him
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or my engine again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;What was it I didn't understand?&quot; he asked softly.  It sounded like he
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really wanted to know.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Christmas presents?&quot;  I motioned toward the back of the van.  There was a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partition behind the driver's seat that blocked my view. He nodded. &quot;That's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what you don't understand.&quot;  He looked blank.  &quot;I get mine all year
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'round,&quot; I laughed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Like what?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Like my family.&quot;  He gave me that frown again and I laughed.  &quot;See?  You
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> haven't got a clue.  A smile from my wife is a better thing to have than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any of the crap you've got back there.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The dawn of understanding began to break across his brows.  &quot;That's...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that's pretty old fashioned.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Old as the hills,&quot; I agreed.  &quot;Older than Christmas, too.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now he got it.  &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he stammered.  &quot;I assumed you were a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Christian... &quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;I am,&quot; I laughed.  &quot;Of a sort.  And a Muslim, if it comes right down to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it. And a Buddhist and a Jew and Inuit too.&quot;  And maybe a touch of White
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Buffalo.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now he was laughing and nodding.  &quot;Okay, I get it.  I think.&quot;  But I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> didn't think he did.  He cocked his head, gave me a thoughtful look.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Yours must be an interesting wish-list.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I smiled back at him.  Maybe he really did get it. &quot;Sunsets are nice.  A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good sunset is a thing to be thankful for.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Good health...&quot; he offered.  I nodded.  He was clearly getting it. &quot;Good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> friends...&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;That's the idea.  All that...&quot;  I gestured toward the back of the van,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;...is just... stuff.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;It's the thought that counts...&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Yeah, but only if the thought is there all year 'round.  Christmas dinner
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the homeless followed by 364 hungry days?  Gimme a break.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He nodded again, slower this time.  &quot;What about the engine?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Because I said I would.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That one took him a minute.  Then he got it.  &quot;Trust...&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;And honor... yeah, stuff like that.  Telling someone you'll do something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then actually doing it...  That's a present of sorts in today's world.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;But... thirty years later...&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Doesn't matter.  What got me pissed was you showing up in the middle of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the night.  And that silly suit!  Do you know you look like Santa Claus?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This time we both laughed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;But haven't you ever wished for something at Christmas?&quot; he asked softly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;You mean, like world peace or wishing no one's house would ever burn down
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on Christmas Eve...&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He interrupted me with a gesture.  &quot;No, I meant something personal.  A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tool, perhaps?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;I've got all the tools I need.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He kept looking at me.  &quot;Never wished for anything?  Not even once?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Sure,&quot;  I laughed.  &quot;When I was a kid.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;What was it?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Time sucked me back more than half a century.  &quot;A wagon,&quot; I admitted.  &quot;A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'Radio Flyer' wagon.  It was about the same color as your van.  Roller
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bearing wheels.  It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.&quot; I was five
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> years old.  I can still smell the oiled wooden floor of the Montgomery Ward
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> store in the little California town as I knelt to worship the marvelous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> machine.  They had it propped up so you could spin the wheels, listen to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the  oily purr of the roller bearings.  I was sure it could go at least a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hundred miles an hour and carry me any place I wanted to go, a magic carpet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disguised in steel.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Did you get it?&quot;   The soft question drew me back. Overhead the stars
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> snapped back into focus on the velvet cape of night.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Take care of my engine,&quot; I ordered as I shut his door, stepped away from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the vehicle.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> He slid back the glass.  &quot;Did you?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;You're going to be late.  Wouldn't want to upset all those yuppies.&quot;  He
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> considered that, conceded the point with a nod.  He fired it up and backed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cautiously up the drive then went rolling down the hill toward the road.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I slept late.  When I stepped out of the shower there was a steaming cup
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of coffee in my favorite mug.  Someone had laid out my shaving tackle.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The kitchen was full of smiles and good smells of things to eat as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> women prepared our Christmas dinner.  My wife gave me a big kiss and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bigger smile.  &quot;I almost tripped over it when the kids arrived,&quot; she
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> laughed.  I had no idea what she meant, gave her a blank stare.  She gave
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me a playful punch.  &quot;Fool. It's perfect.  I can use it for moving flower
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pots and carrying potting mix... &quot;  Something exploded in the microwave and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> she joined the fire brigade.  I took my coffee out to the patio.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It was parked on the walk under the hibiscus, just inside the redwood
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gate. A coaster wagon agleam in red.  It looked brand new.  It even smelled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new. 'Radio Flyer' in white script along the side of the bed.  The handle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was black.  The wheels white with thick black rubber tires.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My wife came out, slipped her arm around my waist, leaned her head on my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shoulder. &quot;It's beautiful.  Where did you ever find it?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the kitchen, my daughter overhead her.  &quot;He probably MADE it!&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Everyone laughed. Even me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Is this what you've been working on?  You came to bed awfully late.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I shook my head, sipped my coffee.  My great-grandmother was Kiowa.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Coffee was 'burnt-bean-soup'.  And still is, to me.   &quot;No.  I think it's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gift.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My wife gave me an odd look.  &quot;Who would give us something like that?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;I don't know.  Maybe a white buffalo.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> She laughed, hugged me a little harder.  &quot;You're crazy.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Yep,&quot; I agreed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
