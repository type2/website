<PRE>Bob is correct (as usual). I've replaced both rubber ends of the fuel
filler hose with the engine in, and at the same time. Helps to have a 2nd
person that can tolerate swearing and arms that can tolerate being
scratched to hell. The 2nd person is useful for either holding the fuel
filler piece or not letting it drop inside to much, while you work the
other end onto the fuel tank itself. I HIGHLY recommend getting it done
with the engine out.
I also tried replacing the sender with everything in, and I couldn't find a
way to shoehorn the thing in there. It didn't get replaced, BUT I did put
some Sea Foam in a full tank and let it sit for a few weeks. When I started
her again, the gas gauge worked! I assume the Sea Foam dissolved some gunk
on the sender itself, so it started sending again. It's not perfect, (3/4
full showing when full) but better than nothing, and better than replacing
it. I was going to cut a hole, (there are some elegant cover solutions on
thesamba.com) but wanted to keep it stock if possible. Good luck with
yours.

I finally found a shop that is good with old VWs, including my 1976 2000cc
Kombi/Riviera camper. They're doing a lot of good, important things that I
don't know how to do and it's going to cost me a fortune but at least
she'll run a lot better, be a lot safer and they give a 36 month/36,000
mile warranty on parts and labor which I will definitely use if I need to.
FYI, the shop is Simards Automotive in Fairbanks, Alaska.

I have a question about something they diagnosed, though, and depending on
your advice, a followup question. I've been having trouble with people in
the back complaining about gas fumes when I fill up. I never top off
because of that. Question 1: I asked these guys if they could replace that
hose, and they said they can't do that without taking out the engine. Is
that right?

These guys have entered the 21st century, they sent me a pdf with all the
info including notes from the technician and costs for everything. Here's
what the tech says about the fuel fill line:

Confirmed customers concern. Started filling tank and found fuel leaking
from
the right rear corner of the body. Removed inspection cover for filler neck
and found hose very dry cracked. Started filling with fuel again and found
fuel
is leaking through cracks. Unable to see other end of hose. There is a big
cover
behind the engine that would have to be removed. Need to replace filler
neck hose and
remove fuel tank cover. Not sure on labor time.

Anything having to do with fuel hoses being dry and cracked makes me very
nervous. This seems like something that just has to be addressed, if not
this week very soon. (Note: I found a different shop, now out of business,
the first summer after I bought the bus, and I asked them to do a long list
of things, mostly based on advice from YOU folks, and one of the things on
that list was replace ALL the fuel lines. I guess they didn't consider the
filler hose one of the fuel lines. So all of the rest of the fuel lines
were replaced in 2009)

Question 2: If they're right, and they have to drop the engine to replace
the filler hose, this is something I will schedule for later in the summer.
Would that give them enough access to the gas tank to replace the gas gauge
sender at the same time?

Thanks, as always.

to answer your questions,  I have changed the fuel filler hose and gas
guage sender without removing engine.
   it is a super huge PITA to do and removing the engine gives them a tiny
bit more room to work with, but my hands tend to be on the small side with
longish fingers so it was a huge help.

most often they cut an access hole in the deck above the fuel sender to
replace it.  turns a two hour job into a 10minute job. but then youe have
a hole in your deck that needs patching.

as for changing the fuel hose yes you have to take air cleaner, rear cover
and ECU cover and ECU out to access the hose. it is not an easy job even
with ideal conditions.  I suspect they want to do it the way VW probably
did it, put the hose on the tank before putting tank in bus.

since taking engines out is no big deal in a bus why not let them do it
the way they find most convienent.
