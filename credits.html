<B>The folks who deserve the most credit (but get very little) are
the ones who answer questions day in & day out on the list. You
keep us all rolling. Thank you.</B>

<P>Special thanks to the following:

HREF="mailto:thom@calweb.com">Thom Fitzpatrick</A> administrate
the lists and put up with lots of crap up with which I no longer
put. All of these guys are princes. A "thank you" means a lot when
you aren't getting paid so don't be shy.

<P><LI><A HREF="mailto:keen@type2.com">David Raistrick</A> is our
server admin and our secret weapon.

<P><LI>Josh Rodgers created and maintained the Library and was one
of those people who would  do just about anything to help out
another Transporteer.  Unfortunately, Josh left us in December of
1998 but his work lives on.
<A HREF="library/library.htm" TARGET="_top">Here's what he started.</A>

<P><LI>Ron Van Ness tended the Library after Josh died, and the
Ness-Tek pages as well. On a day-by-day basis he
<a href="/archive-old/vintagebus/049962.html">contributed
more</A> to this site than anybody else for a very long time.

<P><LI><A HREF="mailto:mattroberds@cox.net">Matt Roberds</A>
currently takes care of the Library and the Archives.

<P><LI><A HREF="mailto:andy@type2.com">Andy</A> keeps the BuySell
pages cleaned of duplicates and spam, which is the sort of work
you don't notice unless nobody does it and then it becomes a huge
problem.

<P><LI><A HREF="mailto:AIRS@dropgates.com">Wade Lloyd</A> maintains
the AIRS initiative, a large database of bus owners who are willing
to give back rubs.

<P><LI><A HREF="mailto:jwalker@URONRAMP.NET">Unca Joel Walker</A>
has kept the statz on the type2 list since its inception and those
of us who were on the Vanagon list owe him for a LOT of useful
information, much of which still lives in the <a href="http://www.vanagon.com/info">Vanagon files archive.</A>
Joel is also responsible for some of the ghastliest bus poetry ever
to sully the Internet.

<P><LI>Jennifer Sarantites for web design and graphics consultation.
<A HREF="http://www.buran.org/">Here's her home page</A>.

<P><LI>Original type2 logo artwork by Jean-Baptiste Le Pesant.

<P><LI><A HREF="mailto:hanlone@Acad.Ripon.EDU">Emily Hanlon</A>
helped with graphics and ideas. When I did the buttons on this site
I was aping ideas that Emily sent me.

<P><LI><A HREF="mailto:mwagner@prizmpharm.com">Michael Wagner</A>
continues to help with graphics and professional graphic design
expertise.

<P><LI>Rock star fontography by <A HREF="http://www.chank.com/"

fun it made you laugh out loud?

<P><LI><A HREF="http://www.i405.com/">Stephen Gutknecht</A> ran

<P><LI>Gerry Skerbitz started it all.

<P><LI>type2.com was coded and is maintained sporadically by <A
HREF="mailto:webmaster@type2.com"> Ken Hooper.</A>

<P><LI>This site was built on a Power Macintosh G3 using BBEdit
4.0 for markup and Photoshop 4.0 for graphics. BBEdit is a lot like
a bus, I guess, I keep coming back to it because it's just better
than the apps with the cup holders and power seats.
