Subject: Thanks

Ron,
I very much appreciate your company coming to my rescue last week by 
getting a friction plate to me timed just perfect for delivery last Friday 
so I could finish off my clutch job.

Please be sure to thank your people for me.

I was pretty darned impressed, and grateful.
I still am.
