Subject: Re: [T2] Front table

Bill,
I was missing one of the two on my 78 when I bought it, so I replaced
both with stainless strap anchors from west marine. They look sharp and
of course will never break. I think I still have the one I pulled. You
may have it if you like. I can't help with the picture.
