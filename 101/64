Folks,

I ma slowly coming to the realization that I am probably *not* going to be
able to find the correct seat cover replacements or vinyl wallboard
coverings for my 78 Champagne edition.

The seats are a burnt red with brownish?/grey cloth inserts.  The wall
boards were burnt?red with plastic chrome down some of the seams.

I haven't seen anything close in any of the mail order houses.

To complicate matters, I really would like to switch to Vanagon seats as
they are supposed to be more comfortable.

Has anyone seen the correct replacement seat covers/vinyl covering?

If I can't restore it to original specs, then what?  I hate to take a
special edition and change it to "standard" or something else, but I can't
see that I have much choice.  Surely, some of you have been here before...

Comments? Constructive suggestions<grin>?

Undecided, dave
