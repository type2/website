Subject: steering wheels

I bought my '77 sunroof bus in the early nineties and have enjoyed thousands
of miles with my hard plastic steering wheel. But, its cracked real bad, so
I replaced it with a soft, sticky spongy one. Yuck.

What years had the thinner, hard plastic steering wheels?

Anybody have a MINT one for sale? I will take any color, as long as its
black!!
