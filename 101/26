Subject: Re: [T2] Relocate Battery

I have mine under the fold out bed in my 79 Westy. Just drilled a hole in
the angled floor just by the rear passenger wheel well for the positive
cable and bolted the ground cable to one of the seat belt anchor bolts. To
stop the battery from sliding around I used wood to box it in place.
