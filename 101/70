Subject: Hot Start Wiring Diagram

Hey Folks,

       OK, I said the other day my Westy ran flawlessly on the winter =
campout trip-I lied. It does have the "hot start" problem. I have the =
relay kit (purchased 3 years ago for my old Westy-never installed it) =
but have lost the instructions! I looked in the library and found Sean's =
write up, "The relay kit comes with good instructions as to which wire =
is supposed to go where"-if you haven't lost the %$*! instructions! =
Would some kind soul out there who still has the instructions  please =
send me (brief) instructions on where each wire goes?  Thanks, Jeff=20
