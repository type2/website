Subject: A great fix

I just solved a problem with NewBus that I am enthusiastic about.
I did the same to Casper, as well.

I want to share what I did.

Problem -  Leak in brake fluid system.............
Items in system:
Brake Fluid Container -
Bottom Connection of the container that connects to the -
Plastic tubing that runs to the brake system -
Rubber sealing Grommet used in the sealing arrangement.

There is a rubber grommet that mates the brake fluid reservoir  nipple and 
the plastic tubing together.
The plastic tubing is clamped to this rubber grommet so as to prevent brake 
fluid leaking out of the connection.

If the rubber grommet fails (and it will dissolve over time), it is a mess 
and a pain to fix.

I took a plastic vacuum cap and slipped it over the nipple on the bottom of 
the brake fluid container. It is a very tight fit, but the vacuum cap is 
soft plastic and will fit/stretch just perfectly.

I then cut the end of the vacuum cap open so it is no longer a "cap" but is 
now a "sleeve".
Call it a bushing, seal, sleeve, whatever.

These vacuum caps come in various sizes and diameters  so use a properly 
selected one that fits very snuggly over the brake fluid reservoir bottom 
nipple.
The one I used was red in color, in case these things have some color code 
for sizings.

The plastic brake line tubing then very snuggly slipped over this vacuum 
cap (sleeve), and sealed perfectly.

It would appear that the need to use a hose  clamp is not even needed, but, 
of course, use a clamp.

The finished result is great.
No rubber grommet to dissolve on me over time, and a very fine sealing 
achieved.

I know, it may seem like a little thing, but I am really happy knowing I 
will not have to worry about that stupid rubber grommet ever again.

My design fix should last for many years with no worries about it ever failing.
