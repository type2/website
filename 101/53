Clark,

There is enough vacuum from a Progressive to run your stock
distributor.  I have a Progressive on my bus (PO); over the weekend I
pitched the 009 (PO again) and replaced it with a dual vacuum
distributor (with thanks to Karl).  Much better low-end pull; no more
hesitation off the start.  A good outcome from a carburetor that
'sucks'.  (pun intended)
