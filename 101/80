We sell both flexible rubber underdash mounts and above-dash plastic
mounting pods for VDO gauges. These are the ones that have been alluded to
by other respondants on the list. The underdash ones angle the gauges up for
easier viewing.  All are genuine VDO products, so they fit the gauges
correctly, and can be found on our website.  (But wait an hour or two before
looking; it's down for maintenance.)
