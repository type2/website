Subject: horn and brake lights are linked

I was not aware until I had to troubleshoot them that
the horn and the brake lights on the 68-71 series, at least,
are linked. A while back the horn stopped working. I just
thought that it had rusted up again. I would get around to
fixing it eventually. Then, a few days ago, a very angry
driver informed me that my brake lights did not work.
I thanked him for letting me know.

To fix the problem, I traced the wiring and found that
the 12 volts that feeds the brake light switch on the
master cylinder is the same 12 volts that powers the
horn. After a few more minutes of poking around, I
found that the wire had somehow slipped off the fuse
box. I reconnected it and both the horn and the brake
lights now work just fine.

Moral: if your horn stops working, your brake lights
might also be dead and you might make other drivers
angry. Fix it soon.
