Subject: Popup Parts Needed

I'm working on a popup camper insert for my SC and am considering making
use of two of the Westy poptop support arm/spring assemblies.  Can
anyone give me a measurement on the span between the two vertical arms
and the total height of the support?

If the numbers work out, I'll be looking to score two of the assemblies,
if anyone has a line on some spare ones.

Thanks,
