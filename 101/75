Subject: Re: [T2] gauge mounting

I used this bezel and mounted them below the radio.  I'm very happy with
it, but it might be a little bit better if they were aimed (aimable?)
towards the driver.

If anyone is interested in the process of cutting out the vinyl padding
and the metal, I have pics I can email you.
