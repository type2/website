Subject: stock vs aftermarket exhaust.

Good morning list.
    My name is Brennan, I'm 17, I am fairly new to the list, and to the 
wonderful world of Volkswagens as a whole.  I just bought my first bus, a 
1978 Westy Champagne edition auto trans. with 124,080 miles.  The engine was 
rebuilt about 20,000 miles ago.  I am currently saving for a new one.  The 
bus interior is in fantastic shape and looks as though it has never been 
camped.  
    The first problem I am going to tackle is the exhaust.  It is very loud, 
It is the stock system.  The whole system seems to be fused together in some 
way.  It almost looks as though it was welded together.  Is this common 
practice?  I thought it came in all those parts so you could replace 
individual parts as needed.  Anyway, I am not even going to mess with it, I 
am going for the whole new system.  I was wondering what the drawbacks were 
of an aftermarket extractor system were.  Or should I just go for a new stock 
system?  And also what exactly does an extractor system do?  I know this 
question may sound very amateur but that is what I am.  So please take it 
easy on me.  

Thanks,
Brennan
78 Westy.
