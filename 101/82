Smile, pause, and then say
"Yup, it's nice to know there's still good people out there".

That response either flatters them, of throws it back in their face; 
whatever their thoughts were to begin with.

Works every time.

To kids,
I say,
"Hey, work hard, play nice, don't spend your money on junk, and you can 
grow up to be the same."

Again,
Works every time.
