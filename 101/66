Subject: FYI - links

Folks, i've seen people give the busboys URL wrong a few times now (it ha=
s a
dash in it), so i figured i'd do a PSA. Most of you already use these sit=
es.
Also - if you send a hyperlink, make sure it gets the "http://" ...

Below are the main parts vendors that have relevancy to our busses.  At l=
east
four of them have a constant presence here on the list.  The way i see it=
, if
you can't get it from one of these guys, you probably can't get it!

Busted Bus - Boulder, CO :  http://www.bustedbus.com/
Aircooled.net - Salt Lake City, UT: http://www.aircooled.net
Bus Boys - Redding, CA :  http://www.bus-boys.com (notice the dash, man)
The Bus Depot - Perkiomenville, PA: http://www.busdepot.com
West Coast Metric - Harbor City, CA: http://www.westcoastmetric.com
Rocky Mountian Motorworks - Woodland Park, CO:  http://www.motorworks.com=


I'm sure there are other great links and other vendors, but these are sor=
t of
the 'icons' of the late bus community.
