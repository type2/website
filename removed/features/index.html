<font face="times new roman" color="#000000" size="4">Howdy! 

<br><br>

Thanks for checking out the features page.  My name is Kevin and I am your host.  I am fairly new VW's.  I have had
my 1976 Westy (aka Mr. Bananahead, named by three daughters) for a little over a year.  So hopefully, if you are new to this
like me, you will find something encouraging.  If you're an old pro, I hope you'll find something useful.

<br><br>

As you can see, I have divided this page into two parts.  One for useful articles/sites on maintaining, restoring, and repairing
your bus.  The second is for those of you who wish to share your bus with the world.

<br><br>

Here's the catch:  There are bunches of sites for the "Look at Me!" side, however, good "Help Me!" sites are a bit hard to come
by, especially since we prefer to link to non-commercial sites.  So in order to be considered for "Look at Me!", you will also need
to submit a "Help Me!" URL for consideration also.</font>

	  <font face="times new roman" color="#000000" size="4">Since summer has officially in full swing (in the Northern Hemisphere) and people are getting
	  ready for summer trips and camping, I thought this site which takes you through restoring your poptop might be good to look over. 
	  While it takes you all the way through an entire restoration, you can peruse and see how to fix just those parts that are in need
	  work on your particular bus.  The site is a reprint from a March, 1989 "Dune Buggies and Hot VWs" magazine.  Enjoy the article and
	  enjoy your summer camping!!
