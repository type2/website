This year we are hoping to focus on a large VENDING AREA.  Are you
tired of paying a lot of money to go to a swap meet and having to
search through a field of Bug parts to find the good bus stuff?  No
fees will be charged for setting up your display of parts that some
busguy out there despratly needs,  so bring all your spare parts and
make someone's world a happy place!
Tee-Shirt sales will be handled on an advance system this year.  The
shirts will cost $15 each and this money will be due by JUNE 12th!
There will be a limited number of shirts available at the event,  so
please get your order in early.  E-mail me for information.

We have planned a caravan along the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway for
Sunday morning before we all depart.  Saturday we will simply be
hanging out!  There will be a large open grill lit on Saturday night
so please bring some hotdogs,  burgers, chicken, tofu, steak  ect!
