First, you must be eligible to post to either the Type 2 or the Vintagebus mailing lists. Information on how to subscribe is on the first page of this FAQ. 


Once you are eligible, simply hit the link "add a new answer" when you are in the appropriate location. When you enter the submission, you will have the opportunity to hide your email address by selecting the "hide attributions" check box. Note that anti-spam features are in effect as well, so even if you allow your email to be seen some modification would be required before the address is usable.


The Faq-O-Matic users guide can be found at http://www.dartmouth.edu/~jonh/ff-serve/cache/2.html if you have further questions. Enjoy!
