by George Lyle [notes by Nikki Elko]
<p>
Basically, you remove the cylinder (put the key in before pulling the cylinder out to prevent loss of the &quot;pins&quot; [wafers]), then carefully rearrange the pins (actually, little flat plates) so that the key makes all the pins retract so that the cylinder can rotate. Work on a clean tabletop so that little bits won't escape!
<p>
On the front doors, the cylinder is held in by the phillips screw that holds the lock lever and, on the early models only, by a set screw that goes into a slot in the cylinder. On later models, the set screw was deleted. [On the engine compartment lock the set screw is accessed via a small hole in the top of the mechanism; it lines up when you push and hold the unlocked latch button about halfway in.] Sometimes the set screws are hidden under a blob of paint [or grease], so you have to dig a bit for them. 
<p>
[To remove the cylinder, turn the key to the locked position and gently pull the cylinder with the key out of the latch mechanism.] It should come apart with no force, so don't bang on it. If it isn't coming apart easily, you're overlooking something!
<p>
Take all the little plates out. Half of them go in one side and the other half go in the other. I seem to remember 9 plates, but 8 [in the engine compartment lock] is possible as well. Now you have a bare cylinder, hopefully with those little springs in their holes held in place by a bit of grease. [For rearranging the springs, I used a small paper clip -- unbent on one side -- to coax them out and reposition them as necessary.] Start with the slot nearest the outside end of the cylinder. Try each plate with your key until you find one that levels out with the key all the way into the cylinder. If you find one, leave it in; otherwise remove it and move on to the next slot. Repeat the procedure for the other slots in order. The idea is to figure out which plates will work in which slots in a systematic way.
<p>
OK, so you've probably found some that fit nicely and some that don't. Now you need to take those that don't and modify them so that they do.  What I do is to take the end of the plate that sticks out and file it down to fit by rubbing it against a flat file. This results in a bit less security than the &quot;correct&quot; plate, but these things aren't high-security anyway!
<p>
[Put the lock back together, turn the key to the unlocked position, set the screw if applicable, reinstall, and voilà! One less key to keep track of.]
<p>
[Notes: (a) I ended up with one wafer and spring left over -- I skipped the filing step, put those aside and went with 7 wafers in the lock, and it works fine. I recycled the above mentioned paper clip to keep track of the spring and wafer. (b) If the lock doesn't turn easily with the key in it, back off the set screw slightly until it does, but not so much that the cylinder will come out of the lock along with the key! (c) I'm going to tag my old key with the its number off the cylinder and keep it. Y'never know.... (d) To paraphrase Steve, file the old key numbers off the cylinder -- any future owners will thank you!]
