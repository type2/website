I sprayed POR15 throughout the underside, as well as the frame for months,
using the same gun. Just run some of the POR15 solvent thru the works
every hour to keep it clear. Also, I thinned the POR15 about 2 to 1 with
the solvent as well (2 parts POR, 1 part solvent), to make it more
sprayable. You should experiment with the mix yourself. And wear gloves
and aspirator. Get nitrile (solvent-proof) gloves from Graingers or
McMaster Carr. The thin latex gloves are useless.
