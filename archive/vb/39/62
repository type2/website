VWoA had better remember what got them where they are now. Their new
watercooled, shiny, excuse for an automobile sure did not.

I would pay 100 bucks to be able to pound some sense into their skulls
concerning what they are doing to OUR industry.

Needless to say, I will never own one of their new "cars" I would rather
cruise in a Horse drawn buggy first.
