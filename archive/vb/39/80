Let that be a lesson to you. This would have never happened in the truck.
You wouldn't have been thinking negative thoughts, and you wouldn't have got
smacked. In fact, in order to prevent bugs from getting smashed I vowed them
off many years ago. I've got myself smashed on a number of occasions since,
and I noted that I was never in a bug.......
