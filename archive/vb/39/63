Hi Don,
Then take out the shifter, check the forward shift bushing for wear and wipe 
out all the old grease and regrease with molygraph grease.

<<  The Bentley is on my xmas list, so I guess I'm now looking for a brief 
description of what things should look/act like from shifter, down through 
floor.  Right now, there is a chrome cover over another plate on top, and 
another plate with a J shaped hook under the floor.  Where the male meets 
female is very loose fitting.  When I move
 through gears - reverse, first and second work great, but I no mater how far 
right I get,  I'm still just getting first and second.  I've tried spinnning 
the plate up front, with the same result.   >>

Okay, postion the lock plate under the shifter on the floor so as to position 
the ridge that sticks upward on the rightside and forward.  Then rebolt 
everything back together.  Probably your biggest mistake is thinking that 
since you do not have third and fourth gear you need to move the shifter base 
more to the right.  Wrong!  When you move the shift lever to the right and 
rear to get third gear you actually have the bottom tip of the shift lever 
and shift linkage rod move to the left and forward.  So to get third and 
fourth gear you actually need to move the shifter base to the left!
