A lot of overheating problems that can not be traced down to external influences are usually a result
of to high a CR.  Do you know who built your engine?  Did they do any CR calculation or adjustments
(barrel spacers, combustion chamber balancing, ect.)?  Just because you are using stock size P/C's and
stock heads does not mean you're running low enough CR.  When I calculated my CR on this totally stock
engine/heads, it came out to over 8.0CR!   Too high!   CC'ing the heads and them matching them to each
other, plus the addition of .060 shims under the cylinders brought me back down to 6.9CR.

My last motor had this same problem when the ext. temp rose.  I eventually killed it.  I'm pretty sure
its because when I slapped on the pistons and new heads I didn't bother to calc the CR.  Live and
learn.
