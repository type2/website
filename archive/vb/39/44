Subject: Generator brush spring

Ok, is there a trick to putting the brush spring back on while the
generator is still assembled?  I've now succeeded in breaking one.  How
do you preload the spring and get it back on the post??

Secondly, I'll now have to disassemble the generator to get the broken
piece out.  This will solve my install problem, but how do you get the
thing apart?  I've got the fan and backing plate off....now what?
Bentley only shows the early style and is very brief even with that one.

Help.

Thanks!

Steve
