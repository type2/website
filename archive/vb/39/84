Subject: Re: [VB] positive thoughts

We love you dearly Raych-girl, but *please* use some
carriage returns along with the positive thoughts. For
some reason yours are the only posts that string out
endlessly to the right making them impossible to read.
I've never known you to lean to the right on anything
excepting your online text formatting. ;-) What's up
with your email tool?
