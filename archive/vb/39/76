I can't speak to this too much.  Normally I think the idea is to leave
the spring on the post - lift it off the brush and let it "unwind"
a little - change the brush - grab the spring end with pliers and
"rewind" it to sit on the back of the brush again.

Look at the other end.  Take the front (FRONT) half of the pulley off
if you haven't yet.  There are two very long screws that go through
the back end plate of the generator and thread into the front end
plate - you can probably see the ends of them on the front side of
the front end plate.  Unscrew both of them and the back end plate
(with brush holders) will slide off the back of the generator; the
armature stays in the front end plate.

Good luck!
