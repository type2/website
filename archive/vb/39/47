Subject: RE: [VB] EMPI rear stabilizer bar

The straps you see on ebay and places like that are empi but they're not
like the originals... the og ones are more rubber looking while the ones in
the blister pack are a woven fabric or strap.  There are a lot of the empi
straps in the blister packs around... don't pay over $12 for em.  I think
vintage parts inc. used to have them on the shelf

How about the axle tube straps?  I've seen some NOS ones in the Empi
packaging....seems the sellers are more impressed with the stupid shrink
wrapped cardboard than the part inside.  Couldn't bring myself to pay that
much
for card board!
