Subject: more shifter linkage questions

Will the shifter linkage from a 58 bus work in a 60 bus? My shifter is 
further forward on the floor on my 60 so I'm guessing that the front
shift 
rod on the 58 is shorter. But is the long straight shift rod in the 58
the same
as what should be in my 60. ( I'm missing both shift rods, and know of
one 
on a 58 parts bus ) Thank-you
