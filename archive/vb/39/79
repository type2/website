Well, that is the coupler then.  It is held in with two set screws.  one
to the shift rod, and one to the transaxle side. (they go into little
divits, so unless they are damaged it is easy to align.)

BUT.  Some bussi are easier then others to do this on....removing the two
parts is simple.  Unscrew, slide around and off.

But getting the new coupler in, just depending on your bus, could involve
unbolting the entire transaxle (nose, cradle, redux bolts) or a
combination there of, for it to slide far enough to get enough room for
the thing to go back in.

The part is readily available at any VWFLAPS who deals with 67 and back
busses.
