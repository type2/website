Hey Don,

Your shift plate may be upside down.  I forget exactly what it looks like 
but remeber thinking when it was right it looked backwards to me.  When I 
first got my bus I swaped my bay shifter for a splitty one and put the plate 
on upside down and had your senerio.  Just try flipping it and see.  Easy 
job with a helper.  However by yourself with no front pushing is a bear...I 
had to jam a stick redneck style just to line the shifter ball in to the 
sloted cup thing.

Good Luck,

Eric
