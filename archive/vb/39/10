...the second digit is the model of bus.  My '69 camper was also a Tye23

The 3..eh. i forget exactly.  The commercial/kombi version if i recall,
but i'm not trying hard.

Full width middle?  Sounds like a nine passenger...but it could have the 2
person middle and be an eight.  There are a few of them on the type2 list.

You're saying it doesnt have the up/down style lock pulls?  Did it have
the "tabs" at the handle like the earlier models? Or are you saying it had
none at all?


> 4.> No interior slider lock handle/switch.

Huh.  I think the panels were this way, much like the split
panels...this would back up the "commercial" aspect.

no surprise here..?

NOT the aisle floor vent control for the heater? (between and just rear of
the front seats, in the walktrough isle)

Still sounds commercial.

If it had rear seats, they were probably added..it sounds like it may well
have been a panel-with-windows.
