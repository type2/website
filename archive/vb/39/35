Subject: Taking out engine for first time

Well, tomorrow is a big day for me. I am taking the engine out of the '67
bus that has sat untouched for 26 years. Tomorrow is a holiday here in
Nevada (state birthday ), and my boss is coming over to help. He loves VWs,
and I am hoping this will inspire him to get a bug or bus. His wife didn't
like it when they lived in SD Cali, because he lived in the garage, playing
with his bug whether it needed or not. She is going to be gone for a few
days, so here we go. I will be posting pictures, and comments about it, and
taking suggestions.
This is an all original bus which has been in my family since we bought it
in 1967.
Should be fun tomorrow.
