Subject: EMPI rear stabilizer bar

My '67 DC has an original dealer-installed EMPI rear stabilizer bar in
need of some repair.  34 years of oil leaks have disintegrated what
appears to be a rubber piece that connected the bracket attached to the
engine to the bar attached to the axles.  Does anyone know if a suitable
replacement part is available?  Or have one for sale?
