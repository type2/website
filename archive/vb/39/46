It was a unknown engine that was in the bus when I bought it. I tore 
the top end down and replaced the heads as they were shot. I bought 
stock VW heads. The head, deck, and shimmed displacement volume 
calculated out to be a compression ratio of 6.6:1. I have also 
checked for manifold vacuum leaks.

Thanks,

Rocky
