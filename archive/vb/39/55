Is this because of VWOA? I think that is ridiculous,
if they have a problem with the repo stuff, maybe they
should get in the business.

Not defending all/any VWOA decisions, but they are
just protecting their copyright. It's just easier to
deny use across the board rather than by individual
case. If they didn't, it could start a precedent with
a company (ala GEX) offering VW-logo pot metal
pistons...
On a similar note, Rolls Royce sued an aftermarket
company for selling fiberglass Beetle "hoods/bon-
ets" with the RR grill. 
...And Harley-Davidson tried to copyright the "po-
tato, potato" sound of their twins...
