  One of the reasons there are no part numbers is because one of my
importer/manufacturers has been fined $65,000.00 by VWoA, even though a lot
of his product was imported from Germany, Mexico and Brazil and was
authorized VW but not for export to the U S A. VWoA is very anal and is
doing nothing else but hurting this industry. I could go on and on but we
have all heard it and the list has allready been there on this subject.

ps; they are fighting the fine

Is this because of VWOA? I think that is ridiculous,
if they have a problem with the repo stuff, maybe they
should get in the business.

Not defending all/any VWOA decisions, but they are
just protecting their copyright. It's just easier to
deny use across the board rather than by individual
case. If they didn't, it could start a precedent with
a company (ala GEX) offering VW-logo pot metal
pistons...
On a similar note, Rolls Royce sued an aftermarket
company for selling fiberglass Beetle "hoods/bon-
ets" with the RR grill. 
...And Harley-Davidson tried to copyright the "po-
tato, potato" sound of their twins...
