They were meant to be driven, the ouch is just part of the equation, what
color is your car and I'll see if I have an OG rear fender in the correct
color for your ride.

yesterday while driving home in stop and go traffic, i reassessed the
relationship between my commuter 1967 beetle and me.  i wondered how i'd
feel if my '67 got smacked.  it is a beetle after all and a kind of late one
at that.  well i decided that i'd be pissed.  about 15 or 20 minutes later
while sitting behind a stopped car, squealing brakes and a crunching sound,
my beetle had a smashed rear passenger's fender.  the lesson i've learned?
think positive thoughts; my thinking about an accident caused one.
