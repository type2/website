Subject: Oktoberbus/Below the Salt 2001 Tshirts

You saw them you coveted them, here's your last chance to get your very own
Oktoberbus/Below the Salt 2001 T shirts.  Order form with instructions at
http://personal.clt.bellsouth.net/clt/d/_/d_jersey/tshirt.html  I need the
orders by Halloween so the shirts will be ready by Thanksgiving Misgivings

sgivings.html
I can mail shirts to those who don't come to get the shirts in person.

If y'think he was mad BEFORE the Normans arrived...
May those who love us, love us.
And those that don't love us, may God turn their hearts.
And if God doesn't turn their hearts, may he turn their ankles,
that we may know them by their limping.
