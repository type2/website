It's a 'Kustom Camper' Has the KK initials on the magazine holder on the
drivers side rear.
I took a pic of it at Ennis. I actually met him and his family at Bug Swarm
in Arlington a few months back but I forget his name. Real nice guy, he
didn't even know I was a bus guy but offered me a glass of brew from his 5
liter mini keg like you get in Europe he had set up in his bus! He's from
somewhere in California (still has the black CA plates) but lives near
Dallas now. I think he said the company was in CA also. It is a sweet bus
with a tent and all. He didn't have that cutout above the cabinet, that
looks like something added on by a PO.
I uploaded a pic at www.vintagebus.com Look for 'Kustom" in the search
section. I thought I took more than one pic but I guess I didn't.

Jim
