Subject: [VB] Doc project stuff

I updated the site.  No big deal, no new docs, but I added a page for
contributors to the project and cleaned up a little bit.  Since most (all?)
of the contributors (10!) are on this list, I was hoping I could get them
to make sure I got their names in the right spots and etc.  So, if you have
(or think you have ;-)) contributed to the project, please check out the
new layout and make sure you're where you deserve to be.  In particular, 
check:

And if you feel like it, check the manuals you've contributed to to be sure
I didn't goof.  It's been several months in some cases, so please forgive me
if I left something out and let me know about it.  

Added a "mirrors" section.  Thanks VintageBus!

Finally, it's "scanning season"...in other words, I'll be out of school pretty
soon.  If you'd like to have something scanned for the project over the winter
break please let me know.  Of course, we _really_ like pre-scanned stuff :-)

Bus content: The other day I went to adjust the passenger mirror and it
broke off!!  I also discovered that my steering box is a little loose, and
I have no toe-in whatsoever.  Looking forward to Bulli Brigade!
