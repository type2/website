Since it's Friday, how about this one that appeared on RAMVA in May:

A blonde pushes her Bug into a gas station.  She tells the mechanic, "it
died".

After he works on it for a few minutes, it's idling smoothly.

She says, "what's the story?"

He replies, "just crap in the carburetor."

She says, "how often do I have to do that?"
