Subject: re sundial vs westy and vent question

thanks all who replied, it was less of a hornets nest than I expected.
Although its obvious that sundials have their champions. One more question
for the experts, what year did the panel vans loose the vent holes below the
roof line, or did they last untill 67
Thanks
