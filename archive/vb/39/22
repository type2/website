Subject: paint gun for spraying POR-15 ?

Hi list !!

I just wonder about spraying POR 15, mostly on frame  and underbodie
carriage, i bet i can use the cheapest spray gun to do the job no ??

What about Campbell Hausfeld.. they seems to be cheap gun, and after
spraying POR15 i think everything must be clogged as this stuff is a real
stainer !!

Thks for any input
