All this talk of Bus steps so I figure I might as well chime in that I ha=
ve reproduction steps, the s-shaped bracket ones with the square pads for=
 $40. They are in transit to me right now, I should have them by the end =
of the month. I used the same guy to do split and bay double bent shift e=
xtensions as well. Those will run $12 ea.

Now you know.......
