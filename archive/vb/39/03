Subject: Adjusting a H30/31 pict carb

Hello listees,

I searched the archives and found vague information on adjusting and 
jetting the H30/31 PICT carburator. I am sure this has been covered 
before. Would someone kindly point me in the right direction for this 
information. My bus is getting real warm after driving 30 minutes at 
60 MPH. My plugs are a grayish beige at the tip and black around the 
base. I have placed the doghouse cooler on the engine and ported it 
in the direction of the tranny through the firewall sheetmetal.  All 
the engine sheetmetal is present. The timing is at 29 degrees at full 
advance. The pulley is stock size. The engine compartment seals are 
fine. The muffler is fine. So I am left with the carb as the possible 
culprit.

Thanks for any help,

-Rocky
