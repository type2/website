Subject: Bearing puller

   Today I am a happy guy, I just recieved my RGB bearing puller and the
collets to pull both the 211 501 285 and the 311 501 283 bearings, now I can
finally tear down all the RGB's I have. Oh happy day!

ps. I will rent this tool for a small fee or for free with the purchase of a
complete set of RGB bearings.
