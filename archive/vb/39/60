Hello Sandy Eggo bussers,

I am moving to Sandy Eggo in two months, and need to know good, quiet, and
secure neighborhoods to consider moving to, in SD. Maximum payable rent
should be $1000, preferably a bit less, for two (2) occupants and one
bus. Where are you folks living?

Not fancy, but somewhere where my restored 67 deluxe will be safe, if
parked outside, although a garage would be preferred.

Any advice would be highly appreciated. Email me off-list. 

Thanks, cal
