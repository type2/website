Hi Karl,
Thanks for the info!  How common is the 1600 L-jetronic out your way?  We 
would love tpo get a complete setup to try out in our 1960 panel with 1641cc 
SP engine.  Eric&Barb

injection. 76 and up type1 1600's used the same L-jetronic as 75 and up buses 
[in the USA]. The injector trigger signal for L-jetronic comes from the 
negative side of the coil. Every time the points open, all 4 injectors open 
at half voltage. For each 2 revolutions of the engine each injector will have 
opened 2 times at half voltage which equals a full shot of fuel. A lot easier 
then having to time each injector to open on the intake stroke with full 
voltage.....
 That is why they gave up on the D system with trigger points.   >>
