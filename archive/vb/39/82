Hey, dude, that's not funny.  My grandmother lives there and we lost
grampaw last October when he went out for a wiz during a storm surge.
Have some respect.

Actually there's a Scamp down the road from my house that I've had my eye
on.  Never seems to move.  Good sign.

PS: Gator?  Allah forbid.  I's born in Tallahassee.
