Hi Jdd,
Depends!  Are you going to try to keep your bus looking like a pre-1964 bus 
or is this a daily driver.  You could install your earlier lower MPH RGBs on 
the 1964-67 center section.  If the bus in question is a daily driver and 
often used on the highway you really sould consider installing a 1965-67 
front suspension and then install a 1964-67 tranny with it's RGBs for both 
higher highway speed and 20% bigger brakes all the way around that feel more 
like 50% stronger brakes.  Do check out by hand the tranny gearing before 
installing, it could be completely geared wrong.  BTDT, which turned out to 
be a 35 MPH (-at-) 3,000 RPM in fourth gear!
