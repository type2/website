       I agree; 
      
       I spoke with the PO and he said that the master cylinder was replaced 
some time ago. So, is there any way to determine if there is a problem with 
it, or do I have to take it apart (something that I really don't want to do 
if I don't have to)? :)

       Thanks again!
