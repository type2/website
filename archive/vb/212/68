Subject: Need help in calculating speed vs rpm

Hi Volks,
I am getting closer to get my '60 DD on the road and would like some help 
in calculating RPMs vs. Speed.  I plan to use the tranny and reduction 
boxes from a '66 and still keep the 15" wheels.  What can I expect with 
that set up.  I have reseatrched the FF but I don't want speed just pulling 
power.  I will have a 1904cc.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Joy Thru Air,
