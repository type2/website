Subject: New Air Cooled Search & Rescue shirts

Howdy. It's time for the annual spring printing of ACS&R shirts. Due  
to the shark-like copyright protectors at VWOA, the design of the Air 
Cooled Search & Rescue Team shirts has changed slightly- everything is
the same except that the VW logo in the center has been replaced with 
a red circle with 2 crossed combination wrenches inside. I will have  
artwork up on the TeamSpatula.com site by Monday, so you can check it 
out. The old artwork is up there for historic purposes, so you can get
the general idea if you're not familiar with it. Ordering details are 
on the tshirt page already. (I am only printing up the red on gray    
version at this time, due to extremely limited finances)              
Anyway, thanks, and see everyone at EveryBus!

Feel free to e-mail me with questions...
