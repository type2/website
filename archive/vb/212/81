Subject: RE: [VB] brake progress (was moaning and clicking)

I'll second what cal just said.  I replaced the M/C last fall and was
expecting better results.  Mine stops at the half way point as well.  I
guess the important thing is that the bus stops.

Don,

On my 67 dual circuit MC, I've never gotten the pedal higher than 2/3 no
matter what. It usually works at halfway, and I've just accepted that.
That's including  replacing the MC, all brake lines, adjusting everything,
etc.
