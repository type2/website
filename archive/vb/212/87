Subject: cat heaters, propane heaters

with the mr heater buddy, we got a smell for a few days... all the 
production chemicals cooking off the plastic and metal, i imagine.
i know there was some debate about a 5000 btu unit (ie, the procats, 
propex, etc) not heating well, but our 5K btu mr heater buddy made a 
significant difference in our 'house'... a 12' x 25' room inside our 
cinderblock warehouse, with a skylight. now, the warehouse wasn't 
MOVING, which i imagine would make a big difference due to airflow 
sucking out the heat, but it was toastier. and MUCH bigger than a bus.
perhaps a $400 propex vs a $400 BN4 isn't a debate, but a $90 
heaterbuddy (or $50 procat) vs a $400 BN4 might be.............
