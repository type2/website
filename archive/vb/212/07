Keith,

My main concerns with tires are two:
sidewall strength to handle the extreme sidewinds I encounter, and
wet traction at highway speeds (55 in rain).

What have you found with regards to these? They are *really* critical to
me. Tire wear is not a big thing for me.  I have been using Michelin XZX
185R14's for the last 17 years with no problems, and much satisfaction.
I feel safe in the rain and wind, and regret that they are discontinued.

Lemmee know, as I'm close to the 'big buy'.

thanks in advantage!
