Subject: re:new aircooled search&rescue shirts, NOT AIRS shirts.

To everyone that has emailed me and anyone else who is wondering.......

***** "Aircooled search and rescue" shirts are NOT AIRS shirts.********

ASR shirts are richards own thing and is not part of AIRS.


The last time these "air-cooled-search&rescue" shirts came out i received a bunch of emails from
people saying they were ready to order, and now im getting the same emails again from another batch
of people, so i just thought id clear it up.
I even got a few emails from people saying they wanted to order a VRS shirt (Volkswagen rescue
society or something) they saw on thesamba. dunno what the heck that is.

AIRS shirts are currently in the work and there will be a link from the website when they are ready.
Portion of the shirt sales to benefit the type2 and vintagebus mailing list servers.
Thanks for all your AIRS support
now at over 1500 worldwide members!
