Subject: My brakes are clicking and moaning

Hi all, In rehabbing my 65 bus, I replaced all brake pads, hardware, 
wheel cylinders and flexible hoses. The brakes worked before, but two 
leaky cylinders caused binding, so I did them all while I had the time. 
  So... I have now bled them twice, and I get excellent clear fluid, 
bubbles stop, etc, just like they're supposed to.  But the pedal goes 
to floor on first try, then 2/3 on second pump, then 1/2 way on third, 
and then I can stop.  So theres still air in there somehow?  I adjusted 
the pads, and they're right where they should be.  The other wierd 
thing is when pumping the brakes and letting the pedal back up slowly, 
the mc is making a "moaning" sound, and the passenger rear wheel makes 
an intermittent clicking sound, like they're binding on something while 
returning to position.  The resorvoir holds fluid fine, and I can't 
find any leaks anywhere.  I guess all signs are pointing toward taking 
off the MC, and checking that.  The thing is, it worked fine before I 
took everything apart at the wheels.  Any other clues on what could be 
wrong here?

TIA
