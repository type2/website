Subject: New engine, broken in, but we can't get idle.

Finally got the new 1600 SP in. Broke in at 2k for 20min, but could not get
idle. Engine will just shut off, can also backfire through carb. Starting
without giving gas is not possible.
Valves at a perfect .006, came that way, checked that way.
009 dizzy at 7.5 static (have the pulley with the DENT for TDC and one mark,
which lined up against an alumn degreed pulley as these marks) Pulley
cooresponds to dizzy position.
Dwell is perfect 49-50 with .016 on the points.

Any ideas for no idle, and a backfire if throttle is fluttered/worked? Will
run at 1700-2200 rpm, but if you drop throttle, she'll seem to lug/choke,
then backfire (not hard) though carb.

Al, almost there.....
