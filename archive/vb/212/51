Subject: Bus Parts Yard Sale Nevada City (Sacramento)

I just got back from the location of the following ad:

USED VW PARTS COLLECTION SALE
Motors, trans axles, body parts, & more
Sunday Feb 16th 9-4 11495 Red Dog Road
530-613-4960

He has parted many busses over the past 20 years
and has a bunch of motors, front ends, trannys,
cooling tin, motor parts, and misc stuff from
busses of many years, all splits.

Obviously by the time any of you read this,
the choice stuff will be gone, but if anyone
in the Sacramento area (Thom?) are interested
he will still have a bunch of major things.

If you can't make it today, give Ned a call and
see what you can arrange for another time. This
stuff is not where he lives, it's at his garage.

It's about 10 minutes past Nevada City, which
itself is about an hour from Sacramento

Jeff who doesn't have a bus, and Ned doesn't really
know what a Type 3 is, so Jeff didn't score anything.
