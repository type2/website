Subject: Re: VB] Brakes Lights/Continuation of 67' MS Question..

  Just went through this (and much more) last weekend. Its been 5 years 
since my bus was registered/legally on the road so alot of stuff wasnt 
working/missing, its been owned by 5 people since then too. One of the last 
battles was the brake lights, which didnt turn out to be the rod (which i 
had hoped) but the switches  (yes, BOTh!). They had constantly been tripped, 
even when taken out of the master cylinder one at a time, the lights stayed 
on! 2 new switches and on the road. I couldnt get that little pin out but 
ended up being able to get the rod loose and adjust it properly (tighter), 
but it wasnt causing the brake lights to trip. But that and a homemade 
muffler and a bunch of other work and my bus survived its first weekend of 
cruising quite well and our show went off without a hitch. I also got lucky, 
my rear shifter bushing had tons of play making the bus almost undrivable, i 
was down there to add fluid to the tranny and happened to check it, the 
bolts were lose and it fixed it to working acceptably! Adjusted the berg a 
little better and good to go. Have a high end miss im working out that seems 
to be fuel related, as a ignition tune up didn't fix it. Id think a stock 
fuel pump should be able to power a 1835 with kadrons no problem but maybe a 
resitriction in the tank (new lines and filter) or something else is up. Ive 
been using the wiring diagrams on thoms site to make sense of some of my 
wiring which is still hopeless but coming along.

If your brake lights are always on, then your MC is always depressed.  This 
is not good, so spin that nut back.  Ya like veewee was saying, the nut is a 
lock nut, and not only do you need to break that free a tad, to actually 
adjust the push rod you turn the actual rod (not on the threads) with a pair 
of pliers or vise griips.  Often it's rusty and the easiest thing is to 
remove that pin and clip that holds the push rod assembly in play, remove 
the push rod thing, get a bucket of wate rand a propae torch, hold the push 
rod thing with a par of pliers and heat it up with the torch.   Drop it into 
the bucket- it should sizzle vigorously.  Repeat.  try breaking it loose. 
This way you don't bend stuff under you bus and get less junk in your eyes.
Clean The threads, grease the threads generously and reassemble the push rod 
assembly.  reinstall lubing all moving parts.   adjust push rod by turning 
the rod which now turns easily, so that there is 1mm free play before the 
push rod hits the piston in side the MC.
