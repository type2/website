Subject: Re: [VB] Fuse Block

I use early bay window's fuse blocks for my 53 & 59.  I have them converted
to 12V, since finding 6V parts here in Indonesia is very hard.  So is
finding original fuse blocks.

Now  I have tail lights, brake lights & blinkers (even the semaphore
blinks), and very bright head lights.

 Driving them at night are much saver...:)
