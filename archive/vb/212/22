What I have found with my master cylinder-is that it looks really old, very
quickly. The fluid inside(the brake fluid) is hygroscopic and super toxic(i
think that is what it's called) anyway I think this stuf causes the master
cylinder to rust in an aggresssive fashion, which makes them appear older
than they are....
