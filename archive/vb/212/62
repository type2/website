Jim Ellis suggests that all chat of Fuel-cell vehicle development or engine
swaps in VWs be henceforth canceled. New power source if we tapped John
Lennons' tomb. Energy produced from Lennon spinning in his grave must be
potentially endless!...

Yoko Ono to Release Dance Version of Lennon Song 
Mon February 17, 2003 06:56 AM ET 
LONDON (Reuters) - John Lennon's widow Yoko Ono has recorded a dance version of
the late Beatle's final song, her record label said Monday.
Ono has teamed up with British pop act the Pet Shop Boys for a dance remix of
her husband's song "Walking on Thin Ice."

"It's not clear when it's going to be released," a spokeswoman for Parlophone
said, adding: "I've heard it, it's very good."

Lennon was shot dead by a crazed fan, Mark Chapman, outside his Manhattan
apartment building in December 1980. After marrying in 1969, Ono and the rock
icon had moved to New York in the early 1970s.

The couple had been working on the track before he died and two months
afterwards the record was released, making it to number 35 in the UK charts.

The single will get its first public performance in the United States Monday
according to the Web Site of disc jockey Danny Tenaglia, who remixed the
record.

Ono will premiere the record with Tenaglia at New York's Arc club on the eve of
her 70th birthday.

Lennon once described Ono as "the world's most famous unknown artist," though
many fans of the Beatles dubbed her Dragon Lady and blamed her for the
legendary group's break up.
