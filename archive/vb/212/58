Subject: Re: [VB] Another silly 67' Master Cylinder Question..

the play at the push rod should be 1mm.  So if it was larger than that, it 
needed adjusting. If you adjusted it down to 1mm, you did the right thing.

Just as long as you made sure there was 1mm play, you need play or the MC is 
always somewhat on.

 This afternoon I bled and adjusted the brakes, still nothing. So, I checked 
 the MC pushrod. Here is where I need the help: There is a lock nut right in 
 front of the rubber boot on the rod itself. This nut was tightened all the 
 way to the very end of the rod. I adjusted this nut downward toward the 
 rubber boot and viola!, the pedal is back up and feels very firm. Was this 
 the correct thing to do? Basically I elimated the travel that the rod had in 
 it, so now it contacts the MC much sooner. I'm a big novice here, so please 
 bear with me. :-) I just want to make sure I am not doing anything wrong, as 
 these are the brakes we are talking about. :)  Thanks so much once again...
