(assuming George is talking about his 603's)

They're suprisingly good.  Very good.  I've been known to push them fairly
hard in the wet and they've never given me a problem....on pavement.

Get off the pavement and they're god-awful.  Sand, grass, mud...  But on
wet or dry pavement they're great.  Acceptable on hard dirt or gravel, but
don't try anything fancy or fun.  For that, I sure miss the yokohama 370
