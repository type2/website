Subject: RE: Tires Tires and More Tires

Hello All

	I have a question about tires not the question about the tires
that originally were installed on our buses but about what type of tires
the lowered group on the list uses. I bought my bus already lowered and
I have been using the 145r tires from Kebler. They are descent looking
tire but poor on mileage and I need something that will last more than
15k. 

Please Help
