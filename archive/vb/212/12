Hi Justyn,
The big trick to properly bleeding dual MC brakes is you have to overadjust 
the brake shoes too tight.  Then after bleeding the brakes you adjust the 
brake stars to thier proper light drag in the drums.  As for the ancient 
looking 1967 MC it could be the problem itself with either road dust sludge 
inside preventing the cup seals to properly seal with the the inside of the 
cylinder wall or the cylinder wall is corroded or the seals themselfs could 
be bad.  Only taking it apart will tell, but first try bleeding the system.
