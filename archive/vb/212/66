Subject: re:procat heater smell

I got one of those heaters, and went through a tank-the smell never went
away-so i returned it...instead i got a stewart warner heater, but i have
yet to install it...i could definitely use it now-we are having a blizzard
here, up to 25" of snow, temps below zero, cars on the street are
disappearing under snow drifts, super windy....time to crank the heat, stay
indoors and have some hot chocolate....
