sounds like a problem I have had in the past-and it was usually due to
reversing one of the wire connections...double check that you have hooked
all the wires up correctly. there is a shut off usually on the carb-that
needs power to allow gas to flow through...

check the wiring diagrams on Thom's site vintagebus.com
