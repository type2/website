Hi Ken,
Hmm, some differance between the first and second brake pedal pressings in a 
short time will show a bit of increased hieght of up to 1/2" or 13mm due to 
the slight ballooning of the flex lines, but there after any rapid succession 
of pedal pump will not increase pedal hieght..  How much is "greatly 
increased" that you have???

First check you present drums, and hopefully someone on this list might know 
whom you are reffering to on Ebay selling drums.  Beware repro drums some 
manufactures of them if not most are junk.  We have seen a fellow who dumped 
good used German drums at his brother's shop and a week later he was digging 
in panic into the scrap barrels for these drums due to the lousey bearing fit 
in the Brazilian drums he had bought brand new!  So better to buy them from a 
well known supplier like Ronnie of Old Volks Home who will not leave you in a 
lurch.
You really do not need a special calipher to measure brake drums.  All you 
need is two pieces of thin wood to put side by side and slide them out till 
each have an end touching the inner drum diameter.  Then mark where the wood 
ends overlap.  Take out of the drum, realign the marks on the wood and then 
measure the total length of these wood pieces with a tape measure or ruler.  
Having the wood pieces each tapered at just the ends that touch the drum will 
increase accuracy.  Please see "Check and adjust Toe-in" in the "How To Keep 
Your VW Alive" manual for a longer but simular tool. 1/64" = .015, 1/32 = 
.030, and 1/16" = .060, etc......
