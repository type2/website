Subject: shipping deluxe trim

Hey everyone,
Has any body had experience with deluxe trim that's been rolled so it can be
shipped.
I found the last missing piece for my bus, but seems that people want to roll
the trim.
Doesn't sound like a good idea to me. I've talked to others that don't think
it's a good idea.

Anyways, hope  someone has had experience with installing it post-rolled.

Thanks in advance,
Dave Barnes
