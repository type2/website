Hi Dixon,
Might be a good idea to remove the E-brake cables clean them and regrease 
them throughly as you feed them back in form the back.  It does sound to us 
like a bad flex line.  Each of these are actually two lines one inside the 
other.  When the inner one breaks it can start to act as a one way valve and 
not allow the release of brake pressure.  So replace that one flex line or if 
it has been more than five years since you replaced all of those flex lines, 
then now is the time to do so.
