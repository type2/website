Don,

On my 67 dual circuit MC, I've never gotten the pedal higher than 2/3 no
matter what. It usually works at halfway, and I've just accepted that.
That's including  replacing the MC, all brake lines, adjusting everything,
etc.

On my 64 with single circuit MC, it had stopping power at 1" down from
the top, just like a power brake on a modern car.

Who knows?
