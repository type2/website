Hi Justyn,
Our best guess says "NO!".  The nut is a locking nut on a threaded rod.  When 
adjusting the rod one often has to break loose the nut from the rod and then 
turn the rod into or out of the MC to proper adjustment of about .040" or a 
little more than 1/32" or 1mm slack before the rod pushes against the MC 
piston.  Climb under your bus and back off the rod from the MC and wiggle up 
and down the rod with one hand till you get the afore mentioned slack while 
pulling down the brake pedal with your other hand.  Without this slack the MC 
piston/s will not return fully to off position where the brake fluid pressure 
can be released back into the resevior on the MC.  Brake pressure will build 
up with a couple of brake pedal depressions causing the brake lights to stay 
on constantly, while the brake shoes will be dragging and heating the brakes 
way up even to a brake fluid fire!!!  Please get the Bentley reprint of the 
1963-67 VW transporter shop manual before you blow up your bus and 
yourself!!!
