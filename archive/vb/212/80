You probably meant head temps of 350 degrees, otherwise there would be long
lines of dubs pulled over on the side of the road!

Bernoulli Interval: Do I really have enough data to draw a valid conclusion ?

Given the air cooled design, which I am told runs at a head temp of around
650F - what keeps this from running down a hot dry road and suddenly up
ahead it has been raining for awhile and you encounter large puddles. How
does this extremely hot motor cope with copious amounts of cold water
without cracking the block? Or it already common knowledge this is bad?

Deep thoughts for the eve,
