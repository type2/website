19mm Wrench, Reversible Ratcheting
Sears #: 00942430000

Craftsman	17mm Wrench, Reversible Ratchetig
Sears #: 00942428000

I dont see a 19/21 combo listed.
there is a 15/17   and a 19/21.
there are cheap sets of metric combos but none seem to include 17
there are ratchet/open end seta that include 17 and 19.
