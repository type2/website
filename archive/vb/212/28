Subject: Re: [VB] shipping deluxe trim

I agree with you, sounds like a bad idea, though I heard that people do it.

i assume you're paying for the shipping, so it's up to you right?  Did n't 
you say it was a door piece... that's not so big to put in a package

 I found the last missing piece for my bus, but seems that people want to roll
 the trim.
 Doesn't sound like a good idea to me. I've talked to others that don't think
 it's a good idea.
