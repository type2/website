I was wondering how much the vacuum effect was caused by venturi  effect if 
any, and how much by the fan and crabs sucking in. I guess you  could test by 
free wheeling down hill and seeing if you get a vacuum in the  engine bay.
   On another note I have fitted a 875mm X 10mm belt. Will  report later.
