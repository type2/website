BTW which rocker? anyway. I have always been very pleased with my
orders from wolfsburg west. Except for a few items which are not made
just like stock (the cargo door rockers on splits is one), everything
I have purchased have been good quality, and usually shipped the same
day or next. I usually make my orders beginning of the week, and
nearly always have the package for me by weeks end. I don't pay for
expidited shipping, or anything like that.
