Hey guys    Now that we have two different people (Tedebare, eric&Barb)   
both giving the same results , with Tedebare even giving his head temp drop I 
would say it is safe to think that the porsche pulley is a good thing to do .  I 
would agree with most of us that it isnt a real good idea to remove the engine 
tin. If any of you have the split bus spec book  by david eccles  on page 61 
you will see what VW did for real hot driving which was to add a set of scoops 
that you could open when you wanted to  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
