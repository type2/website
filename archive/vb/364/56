Subject: Porsche pulleys, an all that stuff......

Watching the on-going discussion on Porsche pulleys and so forth
brought to mind this site I looked at last year.
This looks like a better way to increase your engine cooling all though
more pricey. Wondered does anyone have first hand experience with
this system.  Maybe some comments?
