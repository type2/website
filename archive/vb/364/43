If the  wiper park in the same place each time then you only need to rotate   
the wiper arms.


Hi Mike,
That will only result in the wiper wiping half the windshield and have the  
sweep on the body!  
 
  Russell,
We could spend an hour writing an Email on this and still need to send  
images.  Basicly you need to remove the wiper motor assembly to fix the  problem.  
Plus any wiper motor has not been gone through in the last  five years, it 
needs new grease in its gear box and pivots to be  both swifter , AND quieter.  
We used to have to yell over our wipers  due to old grease.
  Once you have the wiper assembly out we can try to walk you through  the 
problem.
