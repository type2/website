Subject: RE: [VB] wiper motor question

Clara, thanks, that sure sounds relevant.  I'm going to dive into it this morning, so I'll keep an eye out for the 10mm screw.
 
I wish I was near Tacoma so that I could drive over and get some pointers, but I'm across the country, in the Appalachian mountains (where corn winds up in mason jars instead of ethanol...)
