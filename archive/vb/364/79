Subject: I miss my Bus

Hi all! About five years ago I have traded my then Bus for a real basket case
from Wisconsin. After that I really didn't care what happened to her. Now I
kind of miss her and would like to find out where she's at at this moment...
She was (hope still is) a 64 camper (EZ or Sundial) - white/red color combo
with a nose full of bondo. Last owner I traced was Dana Gilbeau from Madison,
Wisconsin. Any help would be appreciated.
