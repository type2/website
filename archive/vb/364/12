No, it's worse. I don't know anybody that drives thier bus in a climate
controlled booth during a road trip. Do you?

Who said anything about hot air recirculating? Tell you what, George, I
daily drove my 64 delux while living in Vegas with temps well over 100
degrees with no "recirculation" issues with that tin removed. 34 mile drive
to work, half highway, half gridlock on the side streets. Never a cooling
issue with my motor. I ran oil and head temp gauges and monitored what was
going on with my motor.

Obviously.

Even more obvious. Look at the Type 1 as a comparison. Watch the progression
of the intake area for the engine through those years as they went to the
doghouse.

Check for the "tolerance" with the split window bus. There is no tolerance
built into it. I've done the tests, and share the information i've gathered
from that. If you choose to ignore it, that's up to you.

What did I say that wasn't true? You might want to re-read what I wrote. As
for the "intake" on a bay window bus, yes the "grill" over the opening is at
an angle, but simple physics explains that it's going to be how far the
scoop sticks out from the car rather than the angle of the intake grill that
will dictate if air will "ram" into it. You need to take a close look at the
intake design of a bay window a lot better than you have. From the main
bodywork, they protrude a full 1 1/2" for the opening from the edge of the
body line. Then look inside the scoop and you'll see it slopes inward quite
aggresivley. This allows the air to follow the bodyline and take even more
advantage of the "scoop" effect. You're way off on your thought on this one.

Sure sounds like it to me. lol

Quick fix? I've driven my buses like this for YEARS. And believe me, the
25,000 miles a year I rack on my buses i've been in every situation you can
think of. Head winds, side winds, tail winds, grid lock in 120 degree heat,
fully loaded, floored for 600+ miles at a time, long dirt-road driving (80+
miles), etc, etc. A "quick fix" does not keep and engine perfectly cool for
years of hard use. Yes there is a risk of pulling in a bunch of leaves into
the fan, or a plastic shopping bag, but you also risk that with getting
something sucked onto your side louvers (I've had a plastick shopping bag
suck onto the side louvers of my bus before (back when I ran the front tin)
so I see no difference.

But what it comes down to, George, is that you have ZERO experience in
testing for engine bay vacuum, ZERO experience in testing for what effect is
has on the cooling system, ZERO effect on monitoring fan shroud pressure in
regard to head temps and engine bay vacuum, and ZERO experience in testing
how a bus engine will run with the front tin removed. But you try to hold an
arguement against actual results that I have gathered with ideas that what I
have done. The results i've gathered so clearly knock out the points you try
to argue that I can't understand what ground you are trying to hold.

Do me a favor, George. Do the same testing I have done, then come back to
this discussion with your results. I've gone through the hell of trying
every combonation I could think of with my buses and am sharing my findings
with fellow people in the bus community. To reply to someone elses actual
experiences and shoot them down acting as if they have no credibility while
you have no experience of your own to base anything on is incredibly
insulting.

I post the information I have gathered on here (and samba, and the STF, and
the CLF) to help people out. Do you see me trying to sell ANYTHING? No. I
gain nothing from going through all this effort except I get to help friends
in the VW scene. If you don't want to go for any of it, that's fine. But if
you think for a minute you're going to argue somebody's actual results, you
better make sure you have ground to stand on or you're going to start
stepping on toes. I'm trying to lead the horse to water. If it drinks or not
is up to me. If you don't like the water, don't drink it.

Sorry for the public rant.
