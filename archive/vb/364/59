Subject: [VB]  need suggestions onloading busses

I found a local junk yard with 2 old split window busses, I want to buy 
to cut up for parts.  They have been striped of all the good stuff, 
including front axle beams, and rear transaxlea.  Here is my problem, I 
have no idea how I can get them onto a trailer with no wheels on them at 
all.  Any Suggestions?  I'm sure someone out there has found a way to do 
this, without tearing everytihing up.

Thanks,
Kevin Howlett
