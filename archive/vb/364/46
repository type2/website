hello  Clara   So the scoops dropped the temp about 10 to 20 degrees   which 
is 
about what I have seen on my test bus a 59 panel  ,   next swap meet I take 
the panel to I will do a test with the porsche  pulley. That will probably be 
at 
the fall Bug Out  later  mark  Dearing


scoops dropped the head temps 10 degrees Celsius.  
this is about 18 degrees Fahrenheit and quite significant
the air flow through the defrost vents decreased
the ENGINE COMPARTMENT temperature also decreased 10* C.   It  went from 
being hotter than outside to being the same. 
 
  What I believe was going on was that more air was blasted through  the 
engine compartment and out somewhere (even though it was fairly well  sealed)  
This cooled the engine compartment air, which is what the  fan blows to cool the 
engine. 
 
I might dig up the pressure #s as well.   But the engine  compartment temp 
numbers seemed much more significant.

 
if you want to do tests, definitely include engine compartment and ambient  
temps, and compare them
 
I had sensors hooked up to a laptop... 
ambient temp, 
engine compartment temps, 
thermocoupler ( head compared to ambient), 
pressure in engine compartment,
pressure outside
 and the airflow meter
