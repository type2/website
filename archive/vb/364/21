yeah, a canopy really helps - for years i had a sheet of thin plywood 
clamped to the 2/3 roof rack, but gas mileage suffered and the noise 
was pretty amusing.  neither are a concern if you are crawling along 
the nifud!

a well-made canvas sheet might work better as far as the noise goes; 
a crap one will flap.


those articles reminded me i need to attach my engine skid plate... 
for fun, one day i want to make ALL the little skid plates and put em 
on.  oughta make routine maintenance quite the entertainment.
