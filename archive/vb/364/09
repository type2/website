I used to consider the "choked flow" concept to be valid, but I've changed
my mind for the following reasons:

1. VW made several changes to increase airflow over the years.  Bigger
crank pulley, wider fan, etc.  If the flow was approaching the point of
choking they would have had to take other measures.

2. Choked flow requires fairly high velosities.  I don't see these
velocities being approached in a fan-forced cooling system.

Frankly, the proof of the pudding is in reduced head and oil temperatures.
That's the goal, after all, and if the temperatures come down it doesn't
matter what the airflow is doing, although I admit some intellectural
curiosity in determining the actual mechanism behind the drop.
