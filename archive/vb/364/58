hello Eric   I have found in my test that that is exactly what the problem 
is.  anything over 1600cc will run hot unless you do something to get more air 
in there.  Scoops do help some, more vents would be the ticket.  I dont agree 
with running without the engine tin or leaving the engine deck open . When you 
take off the front tin on a doghouse what about the oil cooler duct, wouldn't  
that hot air not get sucked right back into  the fan? also the waste from 
heater boxes dumps back there so it to would  get sucked back thur .  I havent 
tried the porsche pulley yet but thats next  .  take a chill pill and have some 
fun   Later  Mark dearing
