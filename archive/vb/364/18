Subject: Engine Compartment Pressure...

Wow, such a hot topic!  You guys are all bringing up interesting ideas.  
To throw some of my experience into the ring, my scooped '67 splitty, 
dog house sp 1600 runs cooler into a strong headwind than on a road with 
no headwind.  The engine compartment is fairly tight.  All seals present 
and working.  Running cooler into the wind while the engine is working 
harder!  Seems like the headwind helps to pressurize the engine room.

This winter I did a top end rebuild on this same sp1600 and adjusted the 
CR from 6.6-1 to 7.2-1.  With the higher CR the engine runs hotter.  No 
question about this.  The power is much better at mid-range.  The fuel 
economy is also better now.  I'm still messing with engine timing, less 
advance now, and jets....

Maybe the real questions with heat are things like, how fresh are your 
heads? how hard are you flogging your bus going up hills? how fast do 
you want to cruise?????
