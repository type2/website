No, it's not that at all. I've repeated myself so many times that it's
gotten old. It's the definition of insanity. Doing the same thing, but
expecting a different result each time. I can only repeat myself so many
times before I have to say to myself "I'm wasting my time".

Take for example a message posted on Sunday about using the DTM shroud. I'm
reapeating myself again when I reply to it and say "Yes, those are great
shrouds, but you still have the issue of the stock louvers on the side of
the bus being a restriction". I've been saying that all along, how many more
times should I say it and repeat myself so that i'm not accused of "taking
my toys and going home"?

This is what I meant when I said "i'm done with it".
