I loaded a bay window bus in a field without any running gear on it one 
time. It was a done creatively with the use of jacks, blocks, wood, and a 
come-along. Did it by myself. I had no idea the bus was in that condition 
and really wasn't prepared. I used what I had and what I could find lying 
around. Drove a long way for a free bus so wasn't worth the gas to go get 
help or more tools. Wasn't fun...but I did it within an hours time.

The others I personally have yanked the running gear from have mostly been 
done in the barn. I use the rafters with cables/chains and come alongs to 
lift 'em in the air and I back the trailer underneath. Did a few in the 
driveway under the hot texas sun before. Used the block/jack/come-along 
method for those.

Those stripped busses aren't very heavy.
