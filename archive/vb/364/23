George, you have a "theory" that recirculation is a problem with this mod. I
have years of testing on multiple buses that that has never shown any
cooling issues at all. You can argue it all you want I guess, but the proof
is in the pudding.

First hand experience has shown me that the more you reduce engine bay
vacuum (and if you can, create pressure with scoops), the cooler head and
oil temps run. Why do I have to have an engineers notebook to validate that?

Interesting how you came to that conclusion. Then how come at 4000rpm while
sitting still, I can pull water 3 inches up a tube with the engine bay
vacuum, and if i'm doing 4000rpm at 75mph, my engine bay has enough pressure
to force the air 1/2" below the water level? The awnser is simple, the scoop
design works, and works very well at that. George, you've never tested for
vacuum/pressure in aVW engine bay, so you have no ground to stand on. I
have.

You're the one that needs to take a tape measure out to a bay window again.
It is a full 1 1/2". My 79 Westy is parked right outside. I've double
checked this measurement just now. It is 1 1/2".  Another reason why
"theory" has to take a back seat to actual testing. You seem to think that
sticking your finger outside the bus is going to tell you all you need to
know about if the bay window scoops ram air or not. Do some actuall
vacuum/pressure testing and you'll see they do a very good job. Again,
"theory" holds no ground to actual testing. If you don't understand that,
then i'm very sorry for you.

I've done a lot of bus cruises that cover dirt roads. My engine bay
collected no more dirt than any of the others on our cruise. A true side by
side comparison if you will. Same drive and all. Again, "theory" taking a
back seat to actual testing. Are you starting to see a pattern here, George?

No offense to anybody, but "well-engineered" is not the correct term. The
reason that mod works is because it relieves the intake restriction to the
engine bay. People that do this mod have the idea that they are providing
"cool air" into the engine bay with it. It does lower the engine temp, but
not because of how they think its working. "Well-engineered" means they know
how and why it works.

Again, ZERO experience with engine bay vacuum/pressure. You've measured
engine bay temperature compared to outside air temp? Big whoop-idy-doo,
that's not vacuum/pressure testing like I pointed out. I've gone another
step further than you have though with engine bay vs. outside air temp. I've
measured that difference of engine bay vacuum vs. outside air temp with the
front tin missing, and with the front tin installed. Do you want to know the
results, or do have a theory and no matter what figures I got from actual
testing you'll argue it anyway? Ah, what the hell, i'll tell you anyway.
With the tin installed, the air temp entering the fan (that's where I put
the sensor) was 20-25 degrees hotter on the highway than the outside air
temp. Want to guess what it was with the engine tin removed? The air temp
going into the fan was the exact same as the outside temp. Interesting. Even
sitting parked in stop and go traffic where your "theory" of recirculating
air is the issue, the air temp into the fan didnt' increase. Now, I do have
a "theory" for you. I think the reason for the increased airtemp going into
the fan came because of the engine bay vacuum all the stock tin provides.
Even if you have all you tin and seals in place, there are still small
airgaps that hot air from underneat can come through, and if the engine bay
is under vacuum, then it is pulling hot air from anywhere it can to feed the
fan.

No, without any testing on your part, you don't have any understanding of it
at all.

What downsides? Everything you've pointed out in "theory", i've given
firsthand experience taken over a number of years on multiple buses to
counter any doubt. Just because you're unable to undersand it, doesn't mean
it's wrong or doesn't work.

Uh, you could do the testing for yourself. That's an idea. You can't shoot
down first hand experience with "theory". Plain and simple.

I've done these mods to a number of buses over the course of years. I've
monitored head, oil, and fan intake air temps. I have all the first hand
experience. George has "theory" and no actual first hand experience with
running a VW engine with the front tin removed.

I agree, let others read both sides (although without any experience with
testing it himself, I don't know that George has a "side") and decide for
themselves.

As for me, i've tried to share my hard work with the community, and I get
the impression that it's a waste of my time. George, you can have the last
word on this if you want, i'm done with it.

Later.
