    Just got back into town from a short trip so I'm a little tardy in
responding to the feedback on BM.

     However,  I was recently talking to some folks who attend BM regularly,
& mentioned I was planning on hanging w/a  VW bus group.  They responded
that last year there were about 35,000 folks at BM  & that about half of
them were in VW buses! That would make BM the largest bus show in the
world????

Tom-looking forward to parallel universes-split windows & vanagons?
