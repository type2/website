First hand is fine, but if you're measuring the pressure differential
between the interior of the bus and the engine bay the results might be
deceptive if the bus is moving.  I'd suggest that you make a U-tube
manometer out of your tubing and place a temporary static port on the
outside of the bus, forward of the air inlet and perpendicular to the
airflow.  That way you'll have the true pressure differential between the
slipstream outside the bus and the engine bay.
