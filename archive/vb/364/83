Subject: 356 Pulley results

I see you all had quite a lively discussion on the subject of engine 
cooling while I was on vacation. I almost hate to bring the subject back 
up, but I did promise to report on the results of the pulley swap after 
the trip, so here it is.

I drove 1727 miles in my bus, which has a 1600 DP with dual Weber 34 ICT 
carbs, a counterweighted crank, full flow filtered synthetic oil, and a 
3.88 R&P freeway flier transmission with big nut reduction gear boxes. 
The belt I used with my pulley was the 1.1 cm x 89 cm belt, also sold as 
a 15350 belt.

The ambient temperatures on the trip were in the high 90's. It was 
actually 100 degrees in Ithaca, NY as I left town to drive home on 
Monday at about noon. Most of my driving was on I-81.

My oil temperatures were 20 degrees cooler than they were before the 
swap at the same speeds. Since the engine was so much cooler I was able 
to drive faster on the interstate. I was able to do 70 mph this year 
instead of 60 to 65 as in past years and my oil was still 10 degrees 
cooler than it usually is on the interstate. I don't have a head temp 
guage, but I checked my valves today, and found that I still had .004 
clearance on the exhaust valves. I set them at .006 just before the 
trip. That's more clearance than I used to find after a hot drive like 
that, so I think it's safe to say that the heads were cooler with the 
Porsche pulley than they were with the stock pulley.

I got my pulley from Pap Parts, http://www.pap-parts.com/, which is the 
place Rocky mentioned in his post back in April. I paid about $43 
including shipping for the hub and two halves. I used my VW washers and 
nut. The pulley has the slot for your screwdriver to hold it while 
tightening the nut.

I think this pulley was one of the best things I've done for my bus in a 
long time. Get yours now before the big rush.
