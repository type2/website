John, does this work if you are running the alternator conversion?
Would it take the same belt you mentioned?

Thanks,

 I got my pulley from Pap Parts, http://www.pap-parts.com/, which is the
 place Rocky mentioned in his post back in April. I paid about $43
 including shipping for the hub and two halves. I used my VW washers and
 nut. The pulley has the slot for your screwdriver to hold it while
 tightening the nut.
