you want to  cruise?????



Hi Gary,
Good points!  We are running at 7.1:1 CR with our 1641cc CW  69mm cranked 
engine, 3.875 R&P FF tranny, with .82 fourth  gear, and 215/75R15s on the rear we 
are able to do 61 MPH.  We  have 205/75R15s on the front which are as close 
to stock size in radial as  possible, and when the 215s rears (which are really 
too big to  easily get in and out of the early flat style rear wheel  wells)  
wear out (which will be soon) will be switching to the 205s on  that axle.  
Then 205s will drop our top cruising speed (-at-) 3,000 engine RPM  to 58 MPH.
  As for hill climbing we keep up with most of the semi  trucks.  When too 
steep to keep  above 2,200 RPM (about 50  MPH) in fourth, we just drop down to 
third at 44 MPH (-at-), 3000 RPM.   When in third and loosing MPH to the point of 
going much below 2,250 RPM (about  30 MPH), we down shift into second and cruise 
along at 25 MPH (-at-) 3,000 RPM.   Fortunately it is very rare for us to need to 
drop down into second gear.   Going through the Syskiyou mountains in S. 
Oregon & N. California  there are two or three of the hills there where we have to 
do 25 MPH,  and even then we are slowly but surely passing most of the semi  
trucks.  That long steep hill (Syskiyou Summit 4310 Ft.)  heading  South of 
Ashland Oregon is definitely one of those.
