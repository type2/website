Remember here that the differential you are are measuring is between the
interior of the bus and the engine bay.  Depending upon the position of
the vents/windows/etc. the interior might be pressurized compared to the
outside air.  Daniel Bernoulli and all that...

Also, a water manometer is very sensitive as 1 foot of water is equal to
roughly 1/2 PSI.  I wouldn't expect to see too much vacuum, as even one
PSI would cause a force of thousands of pounds on the engine bay sheet
metal!  Never heard of a bus imploding!
