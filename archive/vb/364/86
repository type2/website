Hi,

I am not John, but I have a Bosch alternator and I put a P pulley on. I used
my original adapter, washers and nut from my aftermarket pulley. No need to
buy more than necessary.

I have no temp data as of yet. I still need to obtain some temp gages. I am
looking at the ones from Dakota Digital. A bit pricey, but they look quite
good.
Oil temp:
