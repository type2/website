  I cannot wait till someone actually documents whatever everyone is
saying. I have heard and seen everybodys answers to the cooling
question yet I have seen tons of buses with BIG engines, duel carbs go
10's of 1000's of miles with out a hitch.

 Bill Corville DD camper with the 1914 with duel Kaduds, if I am not
mistaken he had put at least 100k miles on that engine without any
extra cooling over the years (he did loose a set of CB heads at 33,000
miles though, valve seats hammered IN) and a customer in Tucson, AZ
with a 2007 with 150,000 documented miles with out additional cooling,
my DD with a 1800 stroker, duel Kaduds and close to 60k miles with
only a type 3 tight finned oil cooler and its hotter then HELL here
half the year and I run 3800 rpm on the highway. (it has developed
some oil leaks so it's coming out for a freshening up but being
replaced with a 2110).
  I also have a customer with a new 1600 Mexi with duel kaduds and
1.25 ratio rockers in his 64 21 window, stock doghouse cooler and has
just gone over 70K with it and still runs like a top and it is used as
a L A freeway commuter now doing the same in Santa Cruz.

  So with the life span on the engines I have seen in buses I am not
worried about needing more air, maybe with the 2110 I will watch my
temps closer.
