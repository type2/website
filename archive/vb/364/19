The advantage of a controlled environment in evaluating changes
is obvious.  It's a luxury I would love to have, and I have a lot of
respect for someone who goes to the all the expense to create it.  There
is value in "seat of the pants" testing, but no researcher would turn down
the opportunity to experiment in a well-controlled environment if that
opportunity existed.

Look, you have a big fan pushing air out the botton of the bus.  If you
have a big opening nearby pulling air from the bottom of the bus into the
engine bay the air is going to take the path of least resistance, which
means that the air will be recirculated unless there is a big slipstream
to carry it away.  In addition, the airflow around the rear of a vehicle
isn't as smooth and predictable as we would like.  You may have gotten
away with this, but that doesn't mean the the people who follow your
advice will.

More about recirculation below.

The counterexample is the Type 2, with no changes in intake area when the
doghouse was introduced.

Yes, you've done the tests but what was the engineer's intent for the
acceptable pressure drop through the intake ducts?  Unless you have
happened upon a VW cooling engineer's notebook I doubt that you know any
more about that than the rest of us.

"...to relieve engine bay vacuum."

Exactly, and the baywindow scoops don't stick out enough to get out of the
boundary layer.

Get out your ruler again.  At its _maximum_ extent, the "scoop"
extends _one_ inch from the body, and most of the scoop extends less than
this value.  I'm being generous here and measuring to the outside of
the rounded lip, not to the inside of the opening.  The "scoops" are
located at the far aft end of the bus, ensuring that the scoop is well
within the boundary layer.  Since you're a "try it yourself" guy, I
suggest that you stick your finger one inch outside the window while
driving your bus and see how much slipstream you feel.

The shape of the inside of the ducts has nothing to do with the pressure
gain.  It's just a plenum, and its shape is determined by the exterior
contour of the bus.

Sorry, but I just can't believe that you would recommend dirt road driving
without a front tin.  Even with a well-sealed engine bay more dust than I
like will infiltrate during dirt road travel.  Without a front tin a huge
amount of dust will get into the engine bay, cooling ductwork, and air
filter.

My experience is different.  I've never had anything bigger than a leaf
come in through the stock cooling vents.  The chances of something getting
in via a missing front tin is obviously greater.

When I said "quick fix" I was referring to the simple discarding of the
front tin.  I have much less problem with well-engineered modifications,
such as cooling air ducted through the front tin from the front of the
bus.  At least in this case, the modifier considered a way to achieve the
desired result without causing other problems.

I suggest that you check to see what work I _have_ done before making
such accusations.  This topic has been discussed previously although
the discussion centered upon missing engine bay seals, not discarding
the front tin.  I measured the difference in inlet and engine bay
temperatures and found the delta T to be about 3C under the
same conditions with good seals.  The important result was that missing
engine seals make a _big_ difference in engine bay temperatures, on the
order of 10-15C, due to recirculation.  Whether you acknowlege it or not,
recirculation can occur.

I haven't and don't intend to test my bus without a front tin, because I
understand the function of that tin and I have no intention of running
without it.  I'd just as soon go without the windshield.

I'm sorry you feel that way,  but the fact is that you are promoting
radical changes in the cooling system while ignoring the obvious
downsides.  If my pointing out these downsides causes you distress there
is little I can do about it.  You may have had satisfactory results in
your particular situation, but those results may not be realized by
other bus owners, and in fact your changes may cause severe problems
for them.  They can read all sides of the discussion and make their own
decisions.
