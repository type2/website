Subject: Nightmare bus incident

Has this ever happened to you?

I parked my 21 window bus (DARTHVW - black bus with
red beltline and "V") at the public lot at the beach.
Spent the whole day out on the beach, far away from my
bus, but never thought about it and never worried. Had
an amazing time! I ran into this group of girls who
were the cheerleaders way back in high school. We
caught up on old times and they all seemed pretty
interested in what I was up to now-a-days. We even
ended up having dinner together down there. 

So, now it's late, it's dark and I'm walking, like
three miles back to my bus, and I have a bad feeling.
Then in the darkness as I walk up to the bus, I see
that the entire front driver's corner is pushed in and
wrapped underneath the bus, like a Hummer slammed into
the front corner going 50. The headlight is pointing
at the ground, the fonrt end in ON the ground and the
bumper brackets are mashed into the seat stand.
But then, as I get closer, I realize "Wait, that's not
my bus. This is a 58 stock color samba"
Then I turn around and see MY bus in the distance.
Whew.
But that's not the end.
As I get closer to MY bus. "Where are the safaris?"
"Where's the wmblem?"
Where are the wheels? The front beam!!!?
My bus has been STRIPPED!
Suddenly things start coming to realization: The
entire driver's side is gone. Like the sheetmetal,
too. You can see into the bus!
The engine and tranny are gone. I walk around the bus
realizing that someone must have had a Sawzall and a
flatbed truck to haul away everything but the right
side and floor of the bus!

THEN I WOKE UP!!!

It was a nightmare!

I immediately, and cautiously, went straight to the
window to make sure DARTH was still sitting in the
(secured) driveway, and in one piece!

Man, I wish I had a way to deonstrate to you guys what
it looked like. I was depresed for like ten minutes
AFTER I woke up.

Sorry to string you along, but maybe there was a tiny
bit of feeling like I had.
It was brutal.
Oh yeah, I think I was in my underwear in the dream,
too.

Keep bussin'
Sweet dreams.
Jason
