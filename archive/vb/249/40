 Where is the pre-heat tube supposed to come from?  I've been letting my paper

has pics of pre-heat pick up tubes.   To find tin, I 'd go to the VW swaps 
and dig around.  Gives you a good excuse to go to shows (like you need an 
excuse, right?).  the pre heat pick ups are kind of hard to find.   But usually they 
are a buck.   There are rights and lefts, shorties and longs, 1" diameter and 
later 2" diameter.   

...so many to choose from.....
