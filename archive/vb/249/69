I can answer a couple of them from experience on other engines. On the end
play change, I've had that occur from a burr or other debris on the crank
which rubbed away after running creating the additional end play.

I took my pistons in and had then measured from the pin and two had to be
decked to get the correct height after first marking the piston direction on
one side with a felt pen. I then weighed them and removed material from the
three heavier ones. The cylinders were left alone since they are not part of
the movable drive chain.

I haven't got to lay in the cam to check it yet. If it turns out like some
cams that I have it will probably get sent back with blue dye on the bad
lobes. They hate me for that!

Probably still a month away on getting my aluminum block into a running
engine.

at last - AND I AM CROSSING MY FINGERS,  SAYING 7 HAIL MARYS AND
SACRIFICING A GOAT JUST IN CASE - i have the aluminum hellmotor
installed in the bus and RUNNING.

some issues remain... i hear air hissing somwehere, and i had to
crank the big carb screw out quite a bit, so i must have an intake
leak someplace, tho  i haven't found it. hope the manifold didn't
crack :P

end play - which WAS at .07mm now reads to .013 - .015, the limits; i
really have no choice but to leave it right now, as the car needs to
be running the last two weeks i am here in texas. if i finish all the
chores and have an extra day before i leave i'll drop it and set
again.
any ideas why this would change?

shimmed both rocker arms .030, and the valve noise lessened
considerably. it may need some tweaking still, and at least one
rocker arm needs replacing due to problems w/ the adjuster... when
you tighten the jam nut, no matter what the clearance setting, the
clearance will shift to .008 - must be stripped internally. bob p,
these are not the ones you sent - those are in a box, and will go on
as soon as i get a free day to shim them for sideplay.

cam is retarded 4 degrees, which sucks, but schneider said to hell
wid it, run it. i did notice that when the throttle is goosed, the
rpm will run to 4500, stay there a sec, and then shoot to nearly 6k!
great for a racecar, but not exactly the torquey motor i was after.
oh well, at least i'll never ping!   other than the timing, intake on
#1 specd exactly to card (duration 220, lift .391) but the exhaust
was a bit off: duration was solid, but i measured lift at .471. this
will hold it open longer, running the valve hotter, so i hope my
measurement was in error. i can't recheck, cuz i dropped the dial
indicator and broke the bezel :P it could also have been my crappy
chinese mounting base, which moves if a fly zooms by it.  as soon as
i replace the dial face i'll redo the measurement.

has some slight vibration, which also sucks, as everything was
balanced. sadly, the replacement p & c i had for jug #4 was a full 5
grams heavier than the other pistons, so that might contribute. when
i get to phoenix and settle in i'll pull it and grind it a bit. that
cylinder has slightly more compression, too. compression is 1 - 6.93
2 - 6.92   3 - 6.93   4 - 6.96.

one small oil leak at bottom rear, but i can't tell if it is the
seam, or if my fullflow fitting has a leak under pressure that is
squirting there.
after 20 minutes of running, the tightfin T3 oil cooler was barely
warm. i'm attaching a temp guage and sender to it, so i'll know the
exact temp of oil to bearings!

aluminum case did get warmer, and stay warm longer, than stock cases.
we'll have to watch that.

as soon as i can pawn the kid off to someone for an hour or two, i
need to roadtest it. wish me luck!
