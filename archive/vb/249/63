Subject: Hello & church key

Hi everyone,

My name is billy and I've been on the type2 list for a few years.

Having acquired my first splitwindow, I will now commence asking questions.

(More about the new 65 later)

My decklid opens with the churchkey. Was this stock?
There is a wallowed out hole in my decklid and some kind of latch inside. My friend's 66 has a regular pushbutton latch. What's correct for my year?

Will any 113-xxx-xxx latches work? I just got one.

Billy
