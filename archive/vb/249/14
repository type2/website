no, nothing wrong at all with them... very informative, in fact. it's 
just that what YOU would be after are the graphs and notes gene took, 
rather than the articles where he says things like "x makes engine 
runs hotter - i tested it, and that's what i say the results are."  i

and the numbers he bases his opinions on.
