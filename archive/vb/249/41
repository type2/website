Subject: VWOA mirrors

Thanks to the more than kind help from a couple of people on this list, I have been able to cobble together a pair of original VWOA elephant ear mirrors and put them on my '67 Westy. I had new mirror glass cut, used the repro grey rubber, redrilled and tapped the mirror arms, polished lubed and reassembled. The vibration is way less then the repros' travelling at 55 mph probably because of the thicker metal used in the mirror and the more substantial mirror attachment point. 

Anyway at least I can see alot better the traffic behind the bus, proving once again that VW original always seem to be the best approach! As a side note, I have another friend with the VW "harp" mirrors, that I would have thought had no vibration, but apparently they have a little as well well on the road.....
