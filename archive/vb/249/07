LOL!  well, that's the bergs - no nonsense cash on the barrelhead! to 
be fair, gene did a lot of research at his own expense; often stuff 
even  the factory might not have bothered with. if the asking price 
wasn't too bad, they were probably worth buying. just make sure they 
weren't just sending you the book of technical articles :P
