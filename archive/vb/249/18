Subject: Sacramento CA info ?????

I HOPE to be heading from Florida to Sacramento California on June 17th for 
the Studebaker Nationals in Sacramento CA.  Is there anyone in the area or 
is there any kind of VW stuff going on the week of June 22nd ???

Email me at VWandSTUDEBAKER(-at-)rocketmail.com  as I check it more often than 
this one.

Thanks,
David
