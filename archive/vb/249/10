 Yes, scoops provide pressure, how much depends on how fast you go.

according to my test, the pressure in the engine compartment varied < =1mm Hg 
between idling and driving at 70 w/ scoops on.  actually, pressure varied 
really little at all ever, which surprised me.

air flow inside the vents was about double w / scoops on compared to no 
scoops.  

airflow from the defroster outlet went DOWN slightly w/ scoops

This says to me that the additional air that blew into the engine compartment 
found it way out around the seals (which were actually all present and in 
decent shape, but of course not airtight).  It did not pressurise the engine 
compartment.  It did not blow more air over the heads/cylinders/oil cooler.    The 
temp in the engine compartment did drop significantly, which to me accounts 
for the cooler temps at the head.

what would an electric fan blowing at the fan do?   I think about f all, if 
not blocking air into the fan.   the stock fan does blow pretty well.

I would have liked to compare different generator pulley sizes.  

the huge amount of air my 65 westy w/ smaller gen pulley kicks out at the 
defogger is really annoying when I have to defog my windows.  It blows in my 
eyes.  (it also has all heat air comeing out up front and has larger heat tubes, 
so even w/ regular pulley it kicked out much more air than the 61 w/ small heat 
tubes and some air going to the back) .  But when I installed the smaller 
pulley the air coming out the heater vents  went up a lot.  whcih tells me it 
does blow more air over the heads/cylinders/oil cooler.    It would be neat to 
find out if that changed the engine compartment temps or air flow into the vents 
or other things.   

hm, maybe I'll put my graphs on a website.
