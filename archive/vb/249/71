good point - thanks for catching the typo.

checked endplay the same place both times... i have the official 
little doodad to check endplay using a dial indicator. checked the 
measurement 6 or 7 tmes, pushing the f/w in HARD each time. it would 
rebound about .01mm and come to rest at the same point on the dial; 
then i would give a firm pull.
after breakin i checked for the hell of it and was miffed to find it 
had opened to the limits. i understand closing up - esp if you don't 
torque the gland nut to full spec before checking the first time - 
but i was startled how far it had grown. i'm going to try and get 
more shims this week and drop it again to change back to spec.

  nah, they weren't needed (or used on any motor i've tyaken apart in 
the last 5 years... do people use these things anymore, and why/why 
not?).
