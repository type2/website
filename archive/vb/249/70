.07mm is .070 mm, and much more than .013-.015mm.
Endplay is .07 to .13mm ( 0.0027"-0.0051")
Let's assume you mean .13mm as installed.
Where did you take that final measurement ?
If you found a better measurement (and procedure), 
fitted the proper shims, installed the main seal
and torqued the nut, did you check the endplay again ?
Did you add a paper or metal sealing gasket
and not verify the additional endplay ?
