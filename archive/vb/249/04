 Today I traded VW parts for this killer '61 Double Door Panel. It's 
 complete down to the original wheels. Cut wheel wells and cab 
 divider. Needs front turn signal lenses and correct rear taillights. 
 Everything else is sweet! Probably the best bus I've brought home 
 ever.  >>

early style or more reinforced later style?
