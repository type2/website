Subject: Misc Item needed

Hello all,
 
 I am looking for a some broken switches and misc items for a side project I have.
 
 I need a fuel gauge, headlight switch, wiper switch, dash grab handle, emergency switch and a stock radio that will fit a '64 dash.
 
I prefer broken items as I am looking for CHEAP prices. These will only be for show. 
 
Cash waiting!
