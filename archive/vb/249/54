Take exit 194A east and proceed to the 42nd st. exit. Turn right at the
light onto 42nd st. Turn right at the next light onto Olympic st. It's the
5th building on the right just follow the vw signs. The address is 3520
Olympic st.

Owner/participant judged car show w/ $5 fee to show. Swap spaces are FREE!

I'll be the guy in the swap with the full length bus rack hanging out the
5ft bed of my green toyota if anybody wants to meet.

Directions from I-5 would be great.
