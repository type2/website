Subject: Re: [VB] scoops are cooler

Thanks for the research Clara.

I was especially interested to see the scoops lead to cooler
head temps.

I have had similar results with a more unscientific test:

I have scoops (good quality steel ones that look like they
could have been factory, if such a thing ever existed) on my
63 Dormobile and not on my 75 Fleetline panelvan (Brazilian
splittie).

I ran the same engine in both buses, and it ran noticeably
cooler (dipstick test) on the scooped 63 Dormer than on the
unscooped panel.

Yes, I also think they're ugly, and I would not have added
them myself, but I bought the Dormer with them fitted.

FWIW ...
