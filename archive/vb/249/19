Clara,
	Thanks for sharing your research with us.  Sounds like scoops help 
provide cooler air, not more air,  to the engine fan vs. no scoops.  
This info really makes engine compartment sealing obviously a critical 
part of cooling.  Without scoops some of the "cooling" air must be 
sucked from beneath the engine through the rubber seals?  Air from the 
scoops must displace some of this hot engine air?  The slight difference 
of air flow at the defrosters with scoops may have to do with the cooler 
air in the engine compartment?
	My 18 year experience with scoops on my '67 is that the engine runs 
cool driving into headwinds.  The current engine is a low CR 1600sp and 
I can drive it at a good clip into strong headwinds wide open throttle 
all day long.  Everything seems balanced and working fine!   Gary Gibson
