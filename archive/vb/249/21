Subject: "Busses by the Falls" details wanted

I was recently contacted by "Randall Petersen" <asic00(-at-)earthlink.net> who is
currently seeking additional information and details regarding "Busses by the
Falls" in Niagara Falls, Ontario, June 20-22.

Although a website is said to exist for the event (URL Unknown) general
information is still needed.

Exact event location and venue name, a graphic map, promoter contact names,
email addresses, phone numbers, anticipated costs/fees, etc., would help. 

Being in Arizona, I will not be attending nor do I know any of the above
desired details. Please pump all correspondence via public email lists, the
official event website or popular "German car" related websites.

I would encourage the promoter or promoting club to add these bits of wisdom to
their website and contact Mr. Petersen as a courtesy. I would also encourage
adding this information to theSamba.com via everettb(-at-)thesamba.com.
Good luck in this regard. I truly hope that everyone who can attend this event
and have a great and safe time.
Peace,
Jim Ellis
Phoenix, AZ
