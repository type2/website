Hi Dave,
That is not too bad.  Anytime one has to plug in a whole quart every 500 or 
less miles as a norm is a problem!  It can take up to 10,000 miles for the 
rings to completely seat in.  Though it problably would be a good idea to check 
your spark plug color, jetting, and fuel pump rod hieght to make sure there is 
not too much fuel getting to the P&Cs which will thin out the oil lubricating 
the rings ruining them!
