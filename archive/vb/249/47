Matt,
You take the prize. I should have been more careful reading the parts
book.
key # A7, part # 113 129 163  "Operating lever-fast idle cam"
is the missing piece. The name says it all...

So, does anyone know whether Brazilian carbs have this piece?
We've got loads of Brazilian VW stuff here. It's literally crawling
with bugs and air-cooled busses from the 80's and 90's. Most of the
busses are split busses with a loaf nose clip (bent window), 1600
engine. The busses that aren't panels have the corner windows like
early deluxes, birch (or some rain-forest equivalent) ply panelling
and, unfortunately, modern plastic rear view mirrors, mounted on the
doors :-p There are also Diesel loafs (and double cabsi want one!),
with a radiator in a black plastic housing on the nose. A lot of people
bought panels and cut windows into the sides, making a poor man's
kombi. People have really odd taste in window sizes and combinations,
and you often see two or three different size windows on the same
"Kombi" or even "Combi", which is what the newer ones tend to be,
generically, called. A few 1989-1993 "Combi" sell for about $1200-1300
us dollars in this weekends papers. Older busses like my '61 are called
Kleinbus by anyone over 45 or so.
If anyone needs help sourcing brazilian parts i'd be happy to do what i
can, since i'll probably be trolling through the bins at the dealer's
soon.
