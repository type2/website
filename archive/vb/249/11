 LOL!  well, that's the bergs - no nonsense cash on the barrelhead! to 
 be fair, gene did a lot of research at his own expense; often stuff 
 even  the factory might not have bothered with. if the asking price 
 wasn't too bad, they were probably worth buying. just make sure they 
 weren't just sending you the book of technical articles :P

I think that is what they were offering to send me...

is there something wrong with them?  I haven't seen the book of tech 
articles, what's it like?  Sounded interesting, but i didn't send them money.
