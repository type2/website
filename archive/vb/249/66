I'm a recent split convert as well Billy. I have found a lot of useful

I found it at my local Borders bookstore & I believe you can also
order it through NEATO, but just stumbled across it here :)

I'm darn sure that what Sean wrote a bit ago is correct. My 66 has a
church key gas lid & a pushbutton engine & hatch.
