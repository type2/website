Well after having my camper interior out for over a year I spent the entire 
weekend getting it back in.  I had saved some of the original foam 
insulation and the original felt that goes over the motor on the inside and 
didn't use them.  Before chunking them, I wanted to make sure noone was 
looking for anything like this.   The foam is the stuff that goes in between 
the roof and the paneling on the roof.  I decided to use newer stuff and 
sound proofing material.  Talk about quiet!  I will try and take some pics.  
I want to thank everyone who sent me reference photo's.  Without those I 
don't I would have gotten the z-bed together.  Just gotta recover the 
cushions and nag at the wife to finish those curtains.  I did put a new 
floor in,  I scored some vintage looking industrial vinyl flooring.  Instead 
of the orignal 2 piece, I screwed the 1/4" ply to the floor cut the vinyl to 
fit and used standard flooring glue to stick it on.  Looks nice w/o the 
seam.  The interior went in pretty easily once I rounded up all the peices, 
it has survived 2 moves.  I did add a few screws to strengthen some of the 
shelves in the cabinet unit and had to reglue the slides for the sliding 
door.  We are going to try going over all of it with some oil.  Any way if 
someone wants the foam or felt (NOT TANK DIVIDER FELTS) I'll keep it for a a 
while.
