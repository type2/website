not too bad, considering!
biggest problem was the source of the  oil dripping: the fullflow 
inlet fitting TO the case was leaking. enough to be more than a 
nuisance; an active leak. not  a river, luckily. i need to see if i 
can back it out and add some permatex to the threads  ... its  hard 
to tighten it any further without either changing the geometry to 
where the hose won't fit, or cracking the case!

next was the carb: too rich. i can't remember whether it has stock 
jets (H30/31... should be a 120 main with i THINK a 130 air 
correction).  my air/fuel meter was pegged at the blue light the 
whole time (should be green). i'll pull it tomorrow and double check.
couldn't find any air leaks, but i sure had to crank the bypass and 
mixture screws out!

not sure if it is related to the carb or the cam, but i had to watch 
my foot on the gas pedal! too much gas and the rpms would shoot to 
the high 3Ks. found my self screaming the engine in 1st gear at 5 mph 
a few times. on the other hand, 30 mph in 3rd gear at 2500 rpm (as 
calculated by my tranny chart) required barely a touch on the pedal.

a few noises i'm still not sure about... could simply be the aluminum 
has different resonances. i do know i am not liking the sound of the 
stock muffler. guess i had the monza muffler too long - came with the 
bus, lasted 13 years!
