If you can't locate or fabricate a 3mm shim,
make an accurate measurement from the case
to the top of the dizzy drive gear shaft, compare to the
dizzy, and add appropriate additional shims to the stack
such that you have at least 2mm ( or more ) of engagement.
Clean the shims and  fit to the shaft with a drop of superglue.
This will hold them for installation, where grease is normally used.
Don't expect these shims to be easily retrieved next time.
If your case originally had the fat shim, it may still be in there
somewhere:). Raising the dizzy drive shaft to where it should be
will hopefully not compromise the gear engagement, but there may
be an unusual wear pattern established from previous improper use.
You should be able to inspect for that down the dizzy port.
