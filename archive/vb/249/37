Subject: pre-heat pick up tube

I'm on 4 mailing lists (of course this is the most important) so I tend to
delete a lot of messages after just reviewing the subject-line.  So - a
million of apologies if this question has recently been answered

Where is the pre-heat tube supposed to come from?  I've been letting my paper
tube just terminate by my push-rod tubes.  Am I missing something?

TIA
