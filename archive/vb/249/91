Fellow bus pilots,
  No doubt it is dangerous to be on the road in a vintage bus that is so out of 
step with today's 75 mph+ air-bagged and crumple-zoned traffic. Seeing Dawn's 
and Richards accident and 2 couples being placed on backboards just south of 
Fresno on 99 really brings this home and makes me wonder if loading the wife 
and kids into a 43 year old bus for a long distance interstate road trip is 
worth the risk.
  We had a white knuckle ride on the way home ourselves when a broken shift rod 

coupler made going from 2nd to 3rd an ordeal that lasted an eternity each time 
it was attempted. Believe me, 30 mph on I5 is not something you want to go 
through...I've never had so many people tell me I'm #1 before! Of course LA's 
stop and go traffic only magnified the problem. From now on I'm keeping an 
extra with my other spares.
