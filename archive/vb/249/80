How high do you normally rev the motor? Stock springs on the new 043 heads
are only good to about 4500rpm (you can push the spring down by hand). If
you rev higher than that, the pushrod can come out of its 'cup', and do as
you explained. You can easily swap the springs out for a set of HD singles
to help prevent this in the future if you want with the engine installed.
