Which is *exactly* why I load mine on the trailer, drive to the general 
area of the weekends activities get a hotel room unload the Bus, drive 
it around the whole weekend and put it back on the trailer and bring it 
home when I'm done.

I like to drive my Buses, and do so everyday, but I-5 and 99 for that 
matter are no place for them for 4+ hours at a time.
