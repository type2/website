Subject: Re: [VB] preheat tube into air cleaner? SOLVED! THX CLARA!!!

Ok, first of all, together with a sweeping bow, my hat goes off to 
Clara.

Last night we were up till about 1am reading the archive and found an 
old post where Clara relates that some engines were set up for air 
cleaner on the right, which means the hole in the tin for the preheat 
and corresponding riser from the heater box is also on the right. I had 
been thrown off because my bus has a cleaner mount on the engine 
compartment ceiling's left side, as well as a triangle brace on the 
left side.

But what i'm trying to say here is that i am astounded at the sheer 
volume of informative, germane, and also quite funny posts from list 
member Clara.

It's heartwarming to see such a display of bus love...

Ok now i'm starting to blush, so we'll go back to fabricating the 
little pin which holds the distributor cap clamps on to the distributor 
body and then out to find some metal flex hose and fiberglass wrap for 
the now empty space between the sound attenuators and the heat ducts. 
Winter is soon upon us here in the Southern Hemisphere. Although 
yesterday was a safari open day. go figure.

Thanks also to all the listmembers who pmailed warning me of impending 
doom, or was it BOOM!, regarding my silly idea of stashing the spare 
gas can in that oh-so-inviting space where a spare battery could go.
