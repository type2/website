Hi Joe,
12-15/32" length.  The problem with going with longer amrs or blades is the 
arc then increases to the point that the upper blade tip then chew up the 
windshield rubber and even the paint on the body from swinging so wide.  We have 
thought about making wiper pivots with shorter arc travel for taller volks!
