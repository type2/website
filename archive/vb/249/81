Not a bad idea.  Mine seem like there's plenty of room to add a bit of length to either the arm or the blades w/o hitting the rubber at the ends of travel.  
I'll check the length tonite.

We certainly had plenty of rain over the weekend, which gave me a chance to test mine.  With Rain-X, they're adequate for all but a toad-strangler.
