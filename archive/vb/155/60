If you're seeing it get sucked dry at idle, try taking off the gas cap
when it's dry and the engine is still running.  See if it then fills
back up.  If so, then your gas tank is not vented right.  You may need
to replace your gas cap or maybe a vent hose.  Otherwise, you might
check that you have the right push rod on your fuel pump (there are
two lengths) and that the fuel pump is adjusted correctly - see Bentley
for details.
