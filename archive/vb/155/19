... I tried to have them ship a middle seat a few years back and they
refused it


I received a middle seat and pedestal shipped from KY by Ghound in about two
days.  No problem, and only about $40!  I have heard that they can sometimes
be a bit snotty about oversized items - it may pay to try more than once.
