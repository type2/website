Subject: safaris CE -Izzys

I have tried to withhold my criticism of Izzy and the way he does business.
I ordered the stainless framed safaris from him several years ago. I took
the truck to the body shop to have them installed because I don't have the
equipment or the know how to do it myself. The shop took the old windows
out, cleaned up & painted the windshield area and when they started to
install the safaris they called me to come & look. There was no way these
windows could ever fit.
I called Izzy & he told me how he was having trouble with the design, he was
getting some new dies made, I would get the FIRST set available. so, I'm
here with no windshields cause they had to break the glass to get the old
ones out. We went ahead and installed the set we had, knowing they would
leak.

I called Izzy off & on for the next couple of years and got excuses ranging
from"the dies still aren't ready" to " I have a sick relative"
Then it got so he wouldn't answer my calls at all.

Over the last 5 or 6 years I have had 2 good stereo units destroyed because
of moisture. We always carry  a dozen towels when we go out of town, just in
case we get caught in a shower.

He knew these windows were defective when he shipped them. It still pisses
me off every time it is mentioned. You asked. That's my story.
