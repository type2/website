Subject: Re: [VB] Shipping

I tried to have them ship a middle seat a few years back and they refused it
as to large. I've managed to ship a sunroof clip from a beetle, a short bus
1/4 panel and a few other large things, but they wouldn't let the seat go.
It may have changed or it may be hit and miss, seems like alot of folks
working there don't really know how it goes so make it up along the way.
They have shipping info on line, I think its www.greyhound.com
