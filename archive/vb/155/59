Subject: Re: Aluminum Engine cases!


	I just got back my bus from the shop and it has a cracked case.
This is the second engine that I have had crack on me over "3" in 27,000
miles and I am not sure what is going on but I am thinking of building
my own and trying an aluminum case. The case is 20 bucks cheaper than
the regular case but I am not sure if it is going to be good in the long
haul. Any thoughts and is anyone using one.


Thanks Again,
