Split Nosers,

  Small Change here to report something that must have been reported
before.  My 61' Side Loader has no gas sender or gauge, I try to keep it
topped off and often pull into gas stations with no idea of how much I
need.  Since here in used jersey, you cannot pump your own, I usually get
someone who does not speak english as an attendent.  Last week the
attendent put 12 gal. in my 10 gal. tank.  I became very confused and the
attendent could not comprehend my complaint.  Since I'm using the POR15
gas tank sealant on my gates and I have an extra tank that need the
treatment, I decided to use my home depot yardstick and measure gallons.  
You can only put the yardstick in one way - horizontal.  Here are the
results -

<2 gal. - no wetness on yardstick
3 gal. - 1.5" wetness
4 gal. - 3"
5 gal. - 4.5"
6 gal. - 5.75"
7 gal. - 7.375"
8 gal. - 8.875"
9 gal. - 10.5"
10 gal. - 12.125"
filled to the top of the neck - 10.5 gal.

  Since I was not that scientific (yes, I spilled some) - use this as
striking ballpark figures.  Tell'em Small Change uses rulers too!

Best,
joe

ps I was informed that a coachbuilding patent was applied for the 61' Side
Loader, but still don't have the companies name.
