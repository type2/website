Wow, sounds like quite the nightmare!  Sorry to hear
about all you had to go through.  I had a similar
experience here in Idaho about 7 years ago and guess
what.... the guy is out of business now.  He screwed
enough people that it eventually caught up with him. 
I guess that however you do business it always comes
back to you, good or bad. :)
