EBAY ITEM # 1855504707

This is a set (6 complete frames) of used, original popout window frames 
removed from a 1966 VW Microbus Deluxe. These frames, for model years 
1955-1967, are in good shape, with only light channel rust to deal with. 
They are painted white, and are still glossy. These are an extremely rare 
item, and I hope they will find a good home in another, well-cared-for bus. 
Winning bidder will pay shipping and handling costs. Payment will be 
accepted via PayPal, Certified Check, or Bank Money Order. All sales are 
final. Please feel free to ask me any questions before bidding. Thanks, and 
keep on groovin'
