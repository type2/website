If you have the engine out and see oil in the bell housing (engine oil not 
gear oil as you can smell the difference) you ought to replace the main seal 
and O ring.  If I were you I'd pull the fan shroud and replace the oil cooler 
seals as well.  Grease the main seal lightly around the face whre it goes 
into thecase to make it go in better.  The O ring is in the FW around where 
it meets the crank- use a small screwdriver to pry it out and wipe the FW 
with a rag and oil the O ring lightly when installing.  Early FWs don't take 
an Oring- they have a step where the meet the FW.

Simple green works well to clean up the bell housingand the case under the 
FW.  Make sure the FW is clean and ungrooved where the clutch presses it.  
That your clutch is dry and has lots of wear left- if it wears down to the 
rivets it'll groove the FW.
