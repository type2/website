Subject: RE: [VB] middle seat seatbelts

we grew up with a 63 bus and then a 65 bus until my dad got an American van
in 1969. In both cases he extended the seatbelts with hand bent steel
straps. The center portions of my SC seat belts are also extended with 8"
steel 1/8" steel straps attached to the original mounting points in the
wheel well. My wife and I needed the, um, extra room. heh heh

I have mine mounted to the floor and there is no tripping problem.

It would be nice to have the belts attached to the seat.  My father's
C*evy van has belts bolted to the middle seat, but the seat supports
themselves are MUCH beefier on the Chevy.  You need two people to carry
the Chevy seat.  I don't think I would want to trust the seat supports of
the VW to carry crash loads.
