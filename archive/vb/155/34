I have mine mounted to the floor and there is no tripping problem.

It would be nice to have the belts attached to the seat.  My father's
C*evy van has belts bolted to the middle seat, but the seat supports
themselves are MUCH beefier on the Chevy.  You need two people to carry
the Chevy seat.  I don't think I would want to trust the seat supports of
the VW to carry crash loads.
