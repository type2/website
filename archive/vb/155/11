Hi Cal,
When filling the RGBs and tranny after  completely draining them, it does 
make it a heck of alot easier to fill the RGBs first, then the center 
section.  While you can fill all parts of the tranny and RGBs through the 
center section fill plug, it is a longer, more painfull time doing this on 
your back pumping or pouring in the tranny gear oil.  Of course if pain is 
your game....  ;-)
