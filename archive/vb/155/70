The old engine cases were made out of magnesium and some other type of
metals. They have just started making\selling the aluminum engine cases
or at least now that I am in the market for one I see them as well. 



Eric


Could you clarify a little bit....what are most engine cases made out
of?
and which type did you have that cracked?

sorry i thought all cases were made of the same material.
