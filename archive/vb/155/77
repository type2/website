In the 3 months after receiving Rudolph from England--I have had a fried
motor after just 35 miles in the Phoenix heat--Blown main seal-Blown Tranny
seal--Leaky nose cone--Installed fresh 1776 low compression motor--convert
to 12 volt--and other
various fixes, the "Turnkey" German Highroof Beer Bus, is now on the
road--Next stop is Jerome Jamboree XII--

Special thanks to Roy Martin--Steve Fowler--Wolfsberg West--And Lady Magoo
with putting up with this old man while I went Bonkers!!
