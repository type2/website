Subject: Flywheel compatibility and seals

Over the next few weeks I have to change the oil seals on my bus, and my
friends bus ready for the UK annual Splitscreen Van Club London to Brighton
run.

First I will start with my bus, it is a 66 with a 1600 twinport.  The
flywheel is still the 6V item, but I have been told that this flywheel does
not properly fit a 1600.  I had to change the seal a few months ago, but did
not use that good a quality seal, and it is leaking already.  When I removed
the flywheel there was no O ring in the flywheel, just a metal spacer
between the flywheel and the end of the crank, with holes for the dowels to
go through.  My local shop said there should be a O ring there so I fitted
one in a recess that was present.  I found it difficult to put the flywheel
back on, but it went back together and ran fine.  I do not have excessive
end play so the fact the seal is leaking is either I nipped it whilst
fitting or else it is a poor fit.
Should I have fitted an O ring to this flywheel?  Was I missing any other
gaskets?

On my friends bus, it is also a 66 (with a chassis no about 1500 later than
mine!) with a 1500 single port.  What gaskets/ seals should this have around
the flywheel?

Also what size clutch should each have?

Thanks
Paul
