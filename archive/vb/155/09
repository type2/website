FYI,

For those of you who are interested, there is a 68 bus w/a good front 
beam in Las Cruces, NM - Garrett Lamb <oilspot2002(-at-)yahoo.com> - is 
selling for $100. You have to pull the beam yourself.

I have nothing to do with the deal other than passing along the info. 
Please mail Garrett if you are interested.

Thanks,
Conrad
