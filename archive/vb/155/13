Subject: re: Shipping

Not a cliche about 'Bama, 'Zona or slack-jawed yokels 
but try Greyhound. I sent a bus towbar with my brother 
when he took the blue Riviera up north. He taped up the 
loose parts and put it on the bus. I got a phone call 
from the local depot and got to drive my double cab in 
with the big boys to pick it up. Not sure of the cost, 
he picked up the insurance premium.
