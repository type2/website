Hi Aubb,
Sacramento always starts with the swapers and/or overnight campers getting in 
Sat. at about 1300.  Gates close for the night and open back up Sun. morning 
to let in more swapers and the buyers.  The meet ends Sunday at about 1700.  
If you show up Mon. all you get to do is stand outside the gates and listen 
to the wind blowing by!  Check http://bugorama.com/ for more info.
