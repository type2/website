I was wondering if any of you fine volks know if any harm will be caused =
to my 64 splitty tranny if I top off the fluid with a synthetic amsoil =
GL 4 fluid, I am assuming there is standard GL 4 in there now.  I can =
not find any standard GL 4 fluid in my area (only GL 5 and I don't want =
to use this) and I have extra synthetic GL 4 fluid that I use on my =
vanagon syncro tranny.  Any help from experience would be greatly =
appreciated.

Thanks,
