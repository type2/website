From the greyhound site:

"The extreme measurements of length, width, and height shall not exceed
either A). 33" x 33" x 48" or B). 24" x 53" x 74". "

A middle seat would be too big.

Greyhound is great though, I've shipped a couple back seats, a few sets of
hoops, and a set of bumpers that way.

Thanks,
