Subject: dusty air heater vents

I have wiped soot several times off the surface of my dash around the heater
vents. It is blown out from the system and is getting fairly annoying. A lot
of it looks like internal vent line rust but some looks like the sooty dust
and dirt that comes off the oil cooler fins. Is there anything on the market
for filtering the cabin air. Maybe an inline filter at the flexible heater
box attach points?
