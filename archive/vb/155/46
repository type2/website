wow, I really feel your pain on that one, and understand having been on the 
raw end of a tranny deal gone bad. :-(

I kept asking myself all day after reading your email about the wisdom of 
taking a car to an Auto Salvage yard for engine "work".  I kept remembering 
the words of the guy I ran into at the junk yard last week.  "They VWs are 
great!  I know this guy who has a VW repair shop and he just comes to the 
junkyard for parts, cleans them up and slaps the engine back together."

I couldn't help wondering what a guy with an engine repair shop in the 
front yard and salvage yard in the back yard would be up to,

Oh well......
Hope you get your engine back running SOON!
