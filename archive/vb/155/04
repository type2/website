A quick test is to pull the wire off at the sender and ground it, then
go up front and turn on the key.  The gauge should indicate all the
way one way, probably "full".  Then go back and unground the wire -
the gauge should move to something around 1/2 or so.  If this doesn't
work, either the gauge or the wire from front to back is suspect.  You
can eliminate the wire by taking the gauge out of the dash and temporarily
hooking it up back at the tank, trying these tests again. 

If the gauge and the wire are OK, it's probably the sender.  You can have 
a broken wire on the resistance element on the sender, or the sender float
can be stuck.  For a broken wire you need a new sender; if it's stuck a
blast of carb cleaner might free it up.
