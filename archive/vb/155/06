Suggestion: Buy a new 5 gallon plastic gas can and fill it up yourself
or fill it at a station you trust.  Mark the 5 gallon point with a marker
on the outside.  Dump the gas into your VW's tank, and take the empty can
to this station.  Try to get them to use the same pump they did when they
put 12 gallons in your Bus.  When the gas gets to the mark, if the number
on the pump isn't pretty d(-at-)mn close to 5 gallons, a call to the state
Weights and Measures people is in order.  If the station is a dealer for
a major oil company, you might call the corporate office as well.

Gas stations have been known to tweak the pumps before and in a state 
where it's all full-serve I think it would be noticed even less.  I
saw an "investigative news" report on TV where they found a station
that was cheating; the reporter called Weights and Measures and the
oil company.  The next day, the state Weights and Measures guy came
out and checked all their pumps, and the oil company came out with
a bucket truck, took all their signs back, and de-franchised the
dealer.
