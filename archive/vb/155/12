John,

No big problem. Buy the same model pump (generator model or alternator 
model)that is working for you now. After you remove the old pump, turn the 
engine through and observe the pump push rod rise and fall. Make sure the 
maximum height it sticks out above the base spacer is the same as called out 
in the pump install instructions. They recommend some lube as well.
