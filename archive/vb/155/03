Subject: Shipping

Has anyone shipped a seat recently?

I purchased a middle seat, for which I have used forwardair in the past,
but they now require you to crate all shipments.

If it's possible to ship another way so I don't have to pay for it to be
crated, that would be preferable.

It's from Alabama to Phoenix, if someone is coming this way... ;)

Thanks,
Everett Barnes
