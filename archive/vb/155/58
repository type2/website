Subject: RE: [VB] Safari's-CE vs. Izzy's

Hi Aubrey,
Maybe you need to find someone who has Izzy's, and someone who has Dave
Palmer's safari windows installed and check them out for yourself.  The guys
who laid down the money for Izzy's or Creative Engineering safari's are
going to tell you that theirs are the best.  You need to decide for
yourself.

If you live in California, you should be able to find a pair of each
installed in someone's bus.  I have Creative Engineering safari's, and live
in So Cal.  Pmail me if you would like to have a look at them.

Ed
