Subject: New French on board 

Hi all 
Let me introduce myself. My name is Olivier and I'm french and I'm new on this 
big list. Usualy I'm intresting in Type H citroën van (I've one of 1978). I ve 
no VW type 2 at the moment but I'm dreaming of it. I'm dreaming to find 
a "samba bus deluxe" split window and offers it to my girlfreind. I want to 
find some french guy that could inform me on VW type2 van in france (where? how 
mutch? witch state? etc...) I'm not sure to know all type2 versions exactly but 
the one I'm looking for is a splited front window with 2 door on the rear side 
with glass on the roof (rounded between roof and side) and 7 seat. I think it's 
called a samba bus but I'm not sure. Can someone Light me ? 

Thank's for you help 

Olivier
