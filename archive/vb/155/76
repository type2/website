Subject: Do I need a main seal?

Probably a dumb question. But when I pulled the engine
from my bus, there was oil in the bottom of the bell
housing of the tranny. Not all the way around the
housing, just around the bottom.
Time for a new main seal? The engine had been leaking
slightly, I thought from back there (back is front)
but there was so much grime on the engine, I'm not
sure really where the oil is coming from (usually the
case, eh?) engine pun not intended.

BONUS QUESTION:  Ever notice the tranny gear oil and
engine oil smell distinctly different?

Mine do, anyway.
