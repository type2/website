VW cases are made of an aluminum-magnesium alloy.

Some cases have been recently imported that are all aluminum, a supposedly
tougher material than the alloy.  I read an article in a VW rag the other
day that cited some machining problems with the cases such as the
inability to fit the distributor drive without some hand-clearancing.  The
problems are such that I think that if I were to go that route I would
send the case to a "guru" like Rimco for massaging before I built it up.
