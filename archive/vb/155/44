            ^^
I wonder if VW's over-active trademark protection department knows
about him?  The enemy of my enemy is my friend...

Other interesting info...Bob is in Pennsylvania.  His domain is
registered to somebody in Texas:

His Web site is hosted on freehostingweb.com under the username
"vwbobco".  Freehostingweb says they give you mailboxes at your
domain; Bob could have his email (-at-)vwbob.com but he doesn't.  His
Web page has a Webmaster address of baja1641(-at-)yahoo.com and a general
contact address of vw_bob(-at-)webtv.net .  His "order form" goes to
the WebTV address and to bobsonline2(-at-)hotmail.com .

He has a '65 Bug race car for sale that he presumably built.
Interestingly enough, he didn't build the engine for it - says it
has a "Kawell racing engine".  He also doesn't know how to spell
Pauter.

He _may_ have previously called his business "Bob's Volksworld."  See
the picture http://www.freehostingweb.com/~vwbobco/jypbobssinglecab.jpg .

Just some extra info.
