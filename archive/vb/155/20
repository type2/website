Subject: Great Canadian VW show & mex engines

Finally got to a VW show for the first time this year, and for someone who
cut his teeth on the classic it was way overdue. Checked out the Great
Canadian Show which was blessed with great weather this year. Couple of good
looking buses, great looking dormobile and 4X4 crewcab. Heard Eric & Barb
would be there, but didnt see anybody that looked to be a Washingtonian ; )
Some pretty good deals to be had in the swap zone. First vender I stop to
see has a pair of BN2 heaters, one a 12v and the other a 6v complete with
most of the ducting for both. Has a tag asking $10cdn for both, Stunned, I
ask if he means all of it. Fastest money has ever come out of my pocket.

Then time to head south to visit the so's relatives and pick up the kid.
Headed to Seattle to help one of type 2's newer members assemble his mex
motor shortblock. Noted a couple of things, no casting for the thermostat, a
too short stud for the manifold base, all in all seemed like a pretty good
deal. We even got the dist drive in the correct way the first time. Had
hoped we would have it in and running before I left, but the inevitable
missing part syndrome raised its heads and slowed us to a crawl as we were
almost finished. Miles down there is going to need one of the small rear
pieces of tin and it wouldn't hurt for him to have a newer rear piece too.
He's got a good looking 71 and is new to VW's so I'm sure He wouldnt mind a
hand. Pretty uneventful trip, only surprise was how fast we crossed the
border both ways, I'm sure it was under a minute both ways.
