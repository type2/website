Subject: When do I need new drums?

I pulled the drums off DARTHVW today (by the way, 46mm
equals 1 and 13/16 when the FLAPS doesn't have the
giant metric)
And the driver's side brake shoes were worn to the
metal at one end, and barely worn at the other end. I
think someone must have driven this bus with the
e-brake on?

Anyway, the drum is grooved slightly, but it loooks
like it has been turned a few times? The metal braking
surface is about 1/8 or so down from where the metal
comes out from the drum edge (make sense).

How much can be taken off before they need replacing?
