Subject: New points/ gone bad.

Installed  new points (Bosch).They were a couple years
old, but still in orig package. After running for a
couple of miles,the bus started missing, popin &
generaly running like crap. Managed to get back home.

After letting things cool off, I checked to see if the
setting was off,nope they were right where it was when
i put them in.

Checked the timeing, here's where things changed.
Turning the engine over by hand the test light stayed
on full revolutions? Changed the condenser this time,
didn't do it the first time. Still wouldn't run?

Changed the dissy & it started fine.I then replaced
the orig points with another set,in the orig dissy
with new condenser problem solved.


As a precaution, hence forth I will keep two sets of
points& two condensers in our spare parts box.
