That, or Bus was driven for a long time without the rear brakes being
properly adjusted.

Is there a lip around the outside edge?  In other words, does it look
like [___] (lip) or |___| (no lip) in cross section?  It shouldn't
have a lip; the whole outside wall should be at the same level as
the surface the brake shoes ride on.

You might mean that it has a lip around the inside edge, like: b___d
which isn't too great either. 

>How much can be taken off before they need replacing?

See page B-8 1 of your Bentley manual.  You should have the 250 mm
nominal diameter drums (the other choice is 230 mm).  According to
the Bentley, if the walls of the drum (where the brake shoes press)
are thinner than 5.5 mm you can't re-use the drums.  The wear limit
on the inside diameter is 251.5 mm - any bigger than this and it
should be replaced rather than being machined.
