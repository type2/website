Subject: RE: [VB] Safari's-CE vs. Izzy's

  For the budget minded get Wolfgangs, they have changed there latchs to OG
style, but still have the wrong profile on the frames, they now cost $409
dollars.
  A friend of mine just installed a set of IZZYS and is complaining about
the flex in the frames, they have the correct profile though and also come
with the one eyed duck and wiper disconnects $450 dollars
  CE's are by far the best if you can live with button head screws holding
the hindge to the frames. They are the correct profile, have the double
walled frame and the best hardware, come with the duck and wiper
disconnects. $500 dollars delivered to the U S, takes about 1 or 2 weeks to
get, these frames are made from extruded aluninum and have tempered glass
and come as a kit that you have to assemble.
  OG (germann Safari's) These are by far the best. I paid 400 dollars a few
weeks ago for an early set with all hardware, no rust, but no glass and just
bought another set with out the mounting hardware but with the glass for 500
dollars this weekend. I will use the hardware from the new set of Wolfgangs
to mount the OG Safaris in my 63 flipseat Westy this afternoon.

ps. Does anybody have a copy of the DEALER INSTRUCTIONS for installing
safaris. Just want to know where they drilled the holes in the winshield
post brackets.

I've been on the list for awhile now.  I remember for
a long time everyone said Izzy's Safari's were the
closest to original VW frames.  Now there seems to be
a following for frames built by CE.  I definetly plan
on installing Safari's on my double cab.  I unbolted
the front window frames because I really need that air
flow to stay cool in the hot Cali Summers.  This
winter I would like to purchase the kit and finally
instal, as I'm doing metalwork to my truck this
winter, and hope to have it perfect by next winter,
christmas 2003.  Which should I buy.  The price is
acceptable if it pays for quality.  Sorry to all those
tired of hearing this story.  I know I have seen it a
lot, but I just started hearing about CE and would
like to know.  Thanks of course.  This list is the
best bus idea yet.
