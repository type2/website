I've got a few friends in Europe that are "Vintage VW" fans like you. I may
get you in touch with them... I just need to talk to them. To start looking
for your Bus go over to Everett's website and search ads. You might find a
few Buses for sale in your neck of the woods... Check:

Good luck and welcome to the list,
