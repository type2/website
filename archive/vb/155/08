Subject: Re: [VB] without guessing fuel measurements!

Every single time I buy gas I record the mileage on the odometer, the amount
of gas, and the cost of the gas.  I fill up at approximately every 200 mi.
(I use Imperial and not U.S. gallons - actually I convert from litres into
Imperial Gallons).  I will run of gas at around 250 mi.  I keep my reserve
switch in shape but I prefer not to use it.
