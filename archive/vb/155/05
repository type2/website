Subject: RE: [VB] Safari Windows

Hi all,
Sorry this is late-just got back from Baja an hour ago.

I installed Dave Palmer safari's last November, when I painted my 67
Sundial.  Took a friends advice and bought them.  From what I can tell, they
are really superior to any others on the market.
I tried to buy them from Ronnie, but he was out of stock, and had a
container sitting on the dock, held up by the 9/11 tragedy.

So I bought mine directly from England.  Called and talked to Mandy.  She
was very knoledgeable and helpful.  She explained about the exchange rate;
Sterling vs. US Dollars.  I placed my order on Monday morning early,
(remember the time difference), and I had them the following Friday morning.
Talk about service...I also phoned back a few times for advice when I was
installing them, and Mandy was great with the advice.

Just look at the window sliders on any brand you can think of, and then
compare them with the CE window sliders, which are really beefy, and
polished.  Cost wise, I paid about $500, including shipping.  Many of the
other kits don't come with the "One-eyed Duck", or the wiper pivots.
Whatever brand you buy, be sure to compare before you buy.

Ed
