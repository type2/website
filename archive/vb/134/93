Subject: RE:Lights on the fritz

when you say that your turn signals or brake lights...do you mean just your
rear tail turn signals?

If this is the case I would say you have a bad/no ground on your tailights.
I am not sure how you would test this exactly...but take a wire wrap it
around the socket that the light goes in. Now take the other end and touch
the body some where(the body of your bus) to ground it. a good spot with
bare metal...like one of the screws holding the rear apron on, or better
yet, run it directly to the battery ground. now check your lights.

I beleive most buses were designed to have the tailights ground through a
tiny screw that goes through the gasket around the lens. bad design. I took
a piece of wire, and ran my own ground for each tailight. passenger side
ground to the same bolt that the battery grounds to, and the driver side
tail light grounds on a screw that holds the rear apron on. now my tailights
are nice and bright.

good luck
