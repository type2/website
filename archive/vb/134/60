from a co-worker...go ahead an e-mail me if you are interested...

                OK - so the cops are finally threatening to impound my =
van if I don't move=20
                it by friday. Thing is, it's dead, and I can't find any =
charitable cause=20
                that is interested in taking it. So, if anyone wants (or =
knows someone who=20
                wants) a 1982 VW vanagon that doesn't actually run, the =
only cost is to come=20
                get it before friday. What a deal! Here's the details:

                1982 vanagon - I paid 1500 for the thing and it was =
running
                New water pump (needed to keep it alive)
                Battery is dead - but I think it'll start if you give it =
a jump - not=20
                sure
                Doesn't like to start in cold/wet weather (what do I =
look like, a=20
                mechanic?)
                Bad gasket in fueling connector tube (means that if you =
fill it above=20
                3/4 full, it leaks gas)
                Expired tabs - needs emissions inspection (but I think =
it'll make it -=20
                there was some work done 3 years ago to get it to pass, =
and that should all=20
                still be fine).

                Think of the possibilities:
                A great project for your new garage space!
                A great source of materials for your "found art" exhibit =
at the MOMA
                Terrific as-is for a party van - just get your best =
friends to push it!

                Seriously though, I just don't have the time and money =
to put in to making=20
                this a useful vehicle again, and I've been looking to =
donate it to a=20
                charity. I think it could be turned into a decent mode =
of transportation=20
                for like 800 bucks. Anyone interested (or know someone =
who might be)?=20
                Please respond or I'll end up paying someone to tow it =
away.
