 Just lookin to see if anyone within a few hours from here has one of those 
nasty vac dizzys they might want to trade for a 009... or a couple of 009s... 
or whatever:)... those vac advance things aint worth a flip no ways.... 
right:)  Need one for a AE 1600 case or newer...
 If one cant be found here near (yes, a few hours is near) Ill broadin the 
search:)
Thanks,

PS if anyone knows of a place to get new diaphrams for a vac, that would be 
be even nicer.....
