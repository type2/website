Subject: RE: [VB] dizzy's & TX listee's

Hi Karl,
I noticed that you have posted great info previously, in response to a
question I had regarding Vac Advance dizzys several months ago, when I
changed over from a 009 to a 205 Vac Advance dizzy.
Your info was really helpful to me.

So I'm wondering what your take is on buying/rebuilding/installing a vacuum
advance dizzy?  Is it better to get one directly off an engine, so that at
least there is a good chance that the dizzy is/was working when the engine
was running?  If you buy one at a swap meet, is there a way to tell if the
dizzy is good/will work?  Seems like there are 2 types of used vacuum
advance dizzys.  One is where the owner switched over to a 009, and ripped
out a perfectly good Vacuum Advance dizzy, and there is where the vacuum
advance dizzy quit working for whatever reason, and the owner replaced it.
Is there a way to tell which is which?

Thanks for your help Karl.  As I said, I did the switchover 3 months ago.
Rebuilt my SOLEX carb also.  My milage went from about 17 to 22, and driving
my 67 sundial is really smooth.

Ed
