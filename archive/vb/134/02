Subject: Lets discuss this.....

OK  Type IV's are all the rage now days. I have been wanting to go with a 
2.0 liter 914 for some time.  In doing my research I have discovered that 
for about the same price I could put in a 2.2T 911.  Have already upgraded 
my tranny in anticipation of the Type4.  No disc brakes, but have got 
braided stainles hoses, new drums and there is no play in the pedal, so it 
will stop.  Also have the new kyb air shocks all around.  My bus is ready 
and I am pretty sure I won't have to cut for the oil sump.  Would like more 
input on this.
