Hello all,
 Well no one wanted my 63 15 window delux whole so I am am gonna part it
out. The body is rusted in all the usual spots but has lots of surface rust.
it was pretty complete. I am keeping the bumpers , belt trim and radio but
everything else is up for sale.
 Jail bars are good ,
corner window frames are pretty good
has back seat , front seats,  middle seat from a bay.
guage, knobs, switches, drivers wheel well,  and other goodies.

 I will ship small stuff , larger items need to be picked up.
Located in Charlotte/Concord NC.
 Thanks ,
 Bryan
