Jim --

I've read before about the '67 air cleaner pre-heat hose running forward
through the front tin to the heat exchanger, but I remain unclear on what is
exactly meant. (My '67 has a '73 beetle 1600DP in it right now.)

Does the hose (1)actually run to the heat exchanger itself, which must have
a non-standard port on it for the hose to connect to? In other words, does
it actually take warmed fresh air from inside the heat exchanger? OR does it
(2)run forward and connect to an intake pipe that bolts to the heat
exchanger and is in the engine-cooling airflow? In either case, the front
(FIF) tin must have a 1-inch hole in its right side, making it different
from other years. And, in Case #1, the heat exchanger must also be a unique
design for this year, so where does one get a suitable replacement?

By the way, Tom, it looks like your pre-heat hose just hangs open at its
lower end. It should run down through the rear tin to a 1-inch intake pipe
that gets bolted to the lower, left-rear area of your engine, to grab engine
cooling air on its way out of the tin. Listees in the past have posted URLs
for on-line pictures of two types of these -- I just don't have the URLs
handy right now.
