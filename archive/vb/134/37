There is a small ad in the current issue of VW Trends for this event.

Last year was pretty cool, with staff members from the mag available for
questions/comments, etc.
There is also a judged car show, and People's Choice awards are given as
well.

It all takes place in Old Town Upland, which looks like it fell right out of
the 40's/50's.  Surprisingly, not many of the businesses were open in the
area last year.  Seems like it would be "Built-In" customers to me.

Is there anything else you need to know?  Cost $15 to get your car
displayed, or to swap.  Free to walk in if you park somewhere else.  I think
it starts at 8 AM, and they start lining up vehicles at 7 am.
