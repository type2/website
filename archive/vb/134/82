Subject: Pulling to the left

My truck started pulling to the left violently when the brakes are first
applied after the truck has sat for any long length of time.  After I
brake a few times she does not pull at all.  This combined with its long
standing misalignment pull to the right makes it a ton of fun at the
first stoplight of the day.  

The pulling to the left just started soon after I adjusted the brakes
(never had done it with any other adjustments).  Could I have a cyl.
leaking on the right side front???  I've not pulled the wheels yet.  All
new everything brakes (hoses, shoes, cyls, etc.) 1.5 years ago (10 K).

Thanks.

Steve
