 Well.... I found out yesterday the SC aint the best thing in the world to 
race with. Or off roading for that matter.... when racing, ya slow to a 50 in 
a 30 mph corner... the front digs right in, but only one rear tire digs in 
(opposite direction of corner) and the other tire comes right off the 
ground... not in that flippin over feelin... but in that 3 wheeler feelin.... 
it can really mess up a good corner.... 
 And whats up with hills and big bumps...... right front tire goes up on a 
big berm... trucks pullin good.... then all the sudden, right rear tire comes 
off the ground.... truck dont pull so good no more:( I reckon ya could hit it 
at a high rate of speed.... but I dont want to tear anything up... ya know? 
 Now after loadin 1650lbs of scrape steel on it, it would take the smaller 
berms (washouts) but we didnt try the high speed cornering test loaded:) 
rides a heck of alot better loaded down too. Empty, its more like a steel 
wheeled poppin johnney at 50 mph....
 It is Friday.... aint it?
