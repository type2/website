Subject: electrical question/fuse box

was writ:
"Also check your fuse box for any fuses that get too hot to touch when ru=
nning
your bus. Any fuse that gets hot needs at least cleaning or very probably=
 the
brass clips pressed into the fuse box need to be soldered together."

i had thought about this...soldering the connections in the fuse box-as i=
t
appears as though these connections are not very good. But it seemed like=

there might be reason not too-or some reason they(vw) never did. I imagin=
e it
would have been cheaper to have lla those connections just soldered
connections...

anyone have any input on this?

thanks
