Hi all,

After finding that actually my 1600 cc DP engine did have the hoover bit in place but no foam, I installed a new foam piece as a replacement. Driving around it appears to have dropped the oil temp 5-7 degrees in 25 deg Cel plus weather based on the VDO gauges.

I also was running 10W-30 Castrol and changed to 20W-50 Castrol which dropped the engine temp another 5 degrees and added an additional 4 lbs to the oil pressure. On a 28 Cel ( 90 degrees +) day plus high humidity the oil temp stayed at 200 degrees ( dipstick sender) at 55 mph.

Like that '67 Westy on Ebay (-at-) 1840442637....despite the "repaired" damage. Original bills, history. and 67,000 orig miles, plus gadgets only an engineer would love. Auction prob. over.... haven't checked if it sold.

'67 Westy
