Bosch suggests that an overall drop of 0.6 V to the headlights on a 12 V
system is acceptable.  I'd guess that 0.3 V would be acceptable on a 6 V
system, but I'd try to minimize the drop as much as possible.  If
everything else was in top shape, that 0.35 V drop at the dimmer switch
is good for a 17%+ hit in light output at the headlights.

It should be white, but OK for now.

You're losing 0.22 V from the battery to the fuse box.  Not super,
but that might be as good as it gets.

You're losing 0.26 V from the fuse box to the light switch.  This
can probably be improved and may be the reason for the warm wires at
the back of the headlight switch.

You're only losing about 0.09 V in the headlight switch itself, which
is pretty good.

Right.  This means you're losing 0.66 V in the dimmer switch wiring.
I am assuming this is still with the spade connector hooked up instead
of the dimmer switch.  If this is with the dimmer switch hooked up,
you're losing about 0.35 V in the dimmer switch and about 0.31 V in
the wiring.  Either way, this is a big chunk.

To sum up these tests:

+6.15 V  battery voltage
-0.22 V  drop from battery to fuse box
-0.26 V  drop from fuse box to light switch
-0.09 V  drop inside light switch
-0.66 V  drop from light switch to dimmer switch to fuse box
-----
+4.92 V  which is almost exactly what you measured at the headlights.

>I imagine it is the wiring between the headlight switch and the dimmer 
>or between the dimmer and the fuse box.

I agree.  If I had to guess I'd say it's the white/black stripe wire
from the headlight switch to the dimmer.  It could also be the other
two wires coming from the dimmer, though.

Not sure.  The wires go behind the parcel shelf and down behind the
fuse box.  You might take down the front panels in the Bus (around
the back of the headlights) and see if you can wiggle the bundle of
wires around the fuse box to get some more slack.

>thanks for all your help.

You're welcome!
