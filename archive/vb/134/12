I haven't had to install "one of those relays" in
quite some time, but if I do, I'm going to put it in
the engine compartment, because then you can start it
with a screwdriver from there.  Actually, I may try to
find one of the old British solenoids that has a
rubber covered button on one end:  makes it real easy.
