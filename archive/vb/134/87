'64 SC>>>

That would also be the setup on my '67 with two exceptions:

1) I have a governor (limiter) under the carb so it sits higher and the
intake air tube is level.

2) The pre-heat hose from the air cleaner goes foward and through the
front tin (front is front) to attach to the right heat exchanger.
