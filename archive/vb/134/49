Sam,

Page 3 is showing up as a thumbnail for me, but the article is fascinating
as much for what the writer does not know as for what he does :-)

The poor writer seems to have done an interview and test
drive on two vehicles he is dead unfamiliar with, then gone
back to his desk and done the writeup.  The article could
have benefitted greatly had he passed it back to the owners
for correction.  Misstatements I see right off:

o The bay bus starts in '67 and ends in '78.
o There is "virtually nothing interchangable" between bay and splittie
o "The new transporter (bay) was longer and wider"
o The bay has "low pivot swing axles with universal joints"

There are some fascinating points, tho...  The bay is a British "Devon"
conversion, and is RHD.  I have never seen a British bus in person, so it
is fascinating to note the differences. The sliding door is behind the
pasenger's seat, that is the left seat, where it ought to be if you are
flipping driving position, but it looks *odd* to my American eyes :-). The
"late model two-litre" appears to have dual carbs.  The hubcaps look very
"Vanagon" to me :-)  Anyone know the driver of this bus?
