Subject: rear shift rod coupler

List-

Is it possible to replace the rear shift rod coupler without pulling 
the engine and transaxle?  Seems like such a lot of work for such a 
small piece of hardware.  I'll do it the hard way if needed, but am 
counting on one of you sages to show me the "easy" way.
