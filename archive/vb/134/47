Hi Michael,
That sounds like a bad connection between the battery and starter or perhaps 
between the starter and generator/alternator.  If you have one or more of 
those lead batter clamps that clamp onto the battery cable to replace the 
original VW swedged on brass battery clamp one will have tons of truobles 
unless one removes these clamps from the cable and clean the cable and clamp 
where they connect.  We solder on new brass clamps From Shucks/Exide onto the 
OG VW cables to prevent corrsion from happening in these extra connections.  
Also check your fuse box for any fuses that get too hot to touch when running 
your bus.  Any fuse that gets hot needs at least cleaning or very probably 
the brass clips pressed into the fuse box need to be soldered together.
