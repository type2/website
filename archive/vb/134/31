Subject: 56-63 wheel cylinder symposium

hi - springing in from the other list... i received four front wheel
cylinders in an auction slated for 64-70 NOS. they turned out to be 56-63,
and the nobel winner who sold and shipped them refused to believe me. no
refund. my question to the list is are they NOS. they appear to be but i'd
like to be sure as possible so that when i trade or sell them i can do so
with integrity. no original box; three of them have raised single digits:
2, 4, & 6. the last one has S176. otherwise they have ATE plugs to keep
dirt and moisture out, and hearty bleeder bolts. my NOS wheel cylinders for
the rear had ATE raised on them, as do my NOS 71+ -- hence the uncertainty.
all help appreciated.   - steve
