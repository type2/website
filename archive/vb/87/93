I drove my '62 Mouse Grey Standard to Kelley Park when I lived in CA from
Napa, totally rained the whole way down (nice day once we got in line
though) and intended to park inside with my club.  When I pulled up, the
guy at the gate asked me where I was showing.  I told him I was parking
with the club, he said, oh no you're not, park with the show cars.  I
parked over by the fire station, where the "Luxury Type II's" were. 
Well, I was the only standard!  But when I left, it was sure easy. 
Pulled right out and drove away.   Anyway.... there were plenty of beat
up and rusted cars in there.  There are so many places that aren't "show
areas."  Really, that's what most of it is.  I'd encourage you to pull
in.  If you can handle the mile long line.  Definately get there early.
