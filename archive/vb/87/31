wondering what cleaners folks have had good luck with cleaning the gunk =
out of the engine compartment. I was able to get most of it with simple =
green and hot water but some of it is just to tough to scrub off. I'm a =
little paranoid of the oven cleaners as I'm trying to preserve whats =
left of the original paint.
