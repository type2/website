Subject: Re: [VB] fuel pump for H-case

 Hello-

Your motor looks like it could be a a '65, well the
tin at least. I don't have a list of cases and the
codes for them.I think a '67 pre-heater set up is
different running behind the shroud, instead of the
front? I could be wrong. Fuel pump looks like a late
model one. You could also be missing the governor but
i'm not sure. That little pre-heater hose clamp that
is on the tin i could be wrong for a '67 and I could
even find it in my heart to help you get rid of it!
let me know.
