And they are both 6 (12) volt bulbs, right?  Bulb bases clean and all
that good stuff?

I saw the gallery picture where you were testing the lights (probably
with a battery or power supply) and they seemed to work OK in that
picture.  You might try that test again, with just the trailer and
a battery, to see what happens.

Check the ground on that right tail-light.  Just jump the right
reflector to the left reflector temporarily and see if that fixes it.

That's much better than a guillotine tap, actually.

Good.  The picture looks like the left tail-light; is there a ground
running to the right tail-light too?

If the Bus lights work OK without the trailer, and the Bus wiring is
stock, and the trailer lights work OK without the Bus, then when you
plug everything together, "it should just work".
