You should check out the wiring diagrams Thom has put on on vintageb....
Oh, sorry, reflex reaction.

Bum ground on right trailer tail-light.  Check the left one too,
but it's probably the right one.  It's also marginally possible
you got one or both of the bulbs in backwards.
 
The reason why the running light works is that it is grounding through 
the right trailer brake light filament and the right Bus brake light
filament.  These have nearly zero resistance when not lit up so it's
almost as good as a real ground.  With the tail lights and the right
blinker on, the trailer running light filament can't ground when the
right Bus brake light filament is energized, but can still ground
when it isn't.

And you ran a ground wire from the trailer frame to the Bus body, 
right?  Thinking "Oh, it'll ground through the hitch ball" is the
number 1 cause of dim, crappy trailer lighting.  Running the ground
wire through the connector is fine, but make sure there is one.

Good luck!
