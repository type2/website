Bad connection, probably a bad ground, at the right rear tail-light
on your BUS, then.  Make the Bus electrics work correctly with no
trailer and then the trailer should work.

Probably the extra load of the trailer lamp is enough to make up
for the somewhat-disconnected Bus lamp and get your right blinker
to blink.  Once it's gone, the front turn signal lamp isn't enough
load to convince the flasher to do its thing.
