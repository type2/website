Subject: Re: [VB] Trailer Wiring Question

Do you mean the "trailer connected" electrically or mechanically?
Mechanically --  could be a ground problem, electrically -- we did have a
problem in the turn signal switch ( on the steering column ), we did the
Radio shack contact spray cleaner (shielding every thing from the spray)
with the switch in place and all was happy every after.
What type of flasher are you using blinken box or 3 or 4 contact flasher?
