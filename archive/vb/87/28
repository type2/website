Hullo, list.

I have a '63 single cab that is a white color.  It's whiter than my Pearl White 
'65 camper.  The plate inside merely says WHITE.  When I entered this into the 
vintagebus registry, it translated out to "Lotus White."  paintscratch.com says 
there was L84 White, L87 Pearl White, L82 Silver White but no Lotus White for 
that year.  Any thoughts as to the true color?

TIA
