Subject: Re: [VB] Red Barn / KelleyPark FYI

just down the street is the San Jose Fairgrounds......no idea what it costs 
to rent but its big......

the "shine"  of the cool backgrounds of old houses has lost out to the hassle 
of getting in......

I hate to try and make it smaller, I just think it needs a bigger place.....

but then you cannot call it Kelly Park !

no way to keep everyone happy........
