Speaking of raffles..............

Was anyone else *very* disappointed at the 50+ T-shirts, and 25+ Johnny
Lighting Bus raffle at the "new" Bug-In. I like raffles where you actually get
some cool stuff. But to stand around for 45 minutes (no joke) while T-shirt
after T-shirt was raffled off waiting for the 2 "big" prizes a starter or
alternator (I couldn't hear the guy so I wasn't sure) and the wood slat rack,
was a disappointment. The rack was cool, but after 45 minutes I would have been
happy with a cool drink and a chair.........................
