Subject: can't figure out red light glow

Hey all,

Ok, my '65 Kombi's red light glows while I am driving. I know
this may be normal for a 6V system due to resistance building up
in the wire to the light over the years, but here's the weird
part: it glows brighter as the engine RPM goes up. It's
completely out at idle, but when cruising at 3K RPM it glows
about halfway on. The other symptom is that the battery tends to
discharge over the course of a week or two if I drive the bus
regularly. I've tried to go through the Muir steps to diagnose
whether it's a generator or regulator problem, but the results
are a little confusing.  I can't remember exactly what multimeter
reading I got from Step 1 (C), but it wasn't 7 or 8 volts like it
was supposed to be. So I did step 1 (D) and the multimeter went
up to 1.48 volts and just stayed there, no matter what the engine
speed was. Sorry for the "Idiot" descriptions of the steps, but
I'm not well-versed in this kind of terminology.  Can anyone
offer any advice based on my crummy description here? My guess is
that the generator isn't doing a very good job of charging,
possibly needing new brushes, and is letting the battery do most
of the work, but not all of it, hence my ability to drive for a
couple of weeks between battery-out-of-the-bus charges. Any
ideas?

Thanks!

Alex Vieira
