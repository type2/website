Hi Joel,
The type 1, 2, 3, engines with larger oil passages would have the two oil 
pressure relief valves and with the cooler removed one passage to the oil 
cooler is visably larger than the other.  AE coded engine cases are supposed 
to have more aluminum in thier alloy and thusly a bit stronger.
