Subject: Couple of 36 HP questions

I picked up a 1959 36hp engine this weekend that I plan on rebuilding =
and
putting in my 59 deluxe. The engine came with a small 4 inch generator
pulley. I have another pulley off a 1960 36hp engine that is 4 =BC  =
inches in
diameter. Which one would be correct? Also the fan shroud was stamped =
with
"M157". Any listies know what that indicates?

Thanks,
Paul Dotson=20
