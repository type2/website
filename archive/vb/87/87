I am under the impression that the tube should be on driver side exhuast
stud, run through the tin, across the pully (stupid clamp, I want one
too), then up to air cleaner on pass side. I don't think there was a
preheat tube right under the air cleaner, except for early buses with
driver side aircleaner.
The tube I pulled out of a 65 (mine is early 66 model year), was
straight, short, angle cut, and had one welded tab to attach to lower
stud. Still need hose to use this, anxious to do so.

Okay,  I correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that my bus is early '65
as it has the early front beam for that year.  Either way I had no luck
finding the rear tin with the hole on the right side and probably won't
be able to find the tube that goes on the left to match the rear tin I
do have.  Maybe I can fudge it until KP where I can maybe find one in
the swap.  Anyone have a pic of the left side tube to help me pick it
out from the tin piles?
