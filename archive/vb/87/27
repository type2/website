Subject: Trailer Wiring Question


Ok, I'm almost done with my 'westy' trailer:
http://vintagebus.com/cgi-bin/search.cgi?string=home+made+westy+trailer

I got it wired this weekend, but have a strange anomaly:
the running lights work fine, but the blinkers are goofy:
the left blinker works in time with the bus, but the right
one works *opposite* the bus.  A cool effect, but I'd really
like them to match.

I tapped into the harness where it comes up by the right
taillight.  I'm using the gray/red gray/black for the running
lights, and the black/red black/white for the blinkies and brake lights.
As far as the connector, it's a straight-thru setup.

Any clue as to what I did wrong?  I haven't had a chance to
take it back apart yet...

Thom
