Subject: Warm Ups


In 15-degree, cold, stultifyingly black mornings up here in Reno, Nev, just
how long *should* one warm up a relatively new (c. 1999) 1600cc engine in a
vintage bus (c. 1967)?

From my previous bus' experience that I had for 20 years (in the same
locale), I'd always given it five minutes and then it's off we go, slow
RPM's first, then up to speed. It was always ample for said previous bus.
Never, in 20 years, ever had a problem, engine after engine.

With this bus, this isn't working. Gas is *repeatedly* contaminating the
crankcase oil, after the five-minute warm-up.

The carburetor choke checks completely operational.

Stumped, I took it to people who are paid to work on these things and was
told to warm it up til the choke is off.

That's great, but how does one ascertain this? *I'm* looking at two gauges:
0-80 PSI oil pressure and 120-300-degree F oil temperature. Presently, after
warming up for five minutes, I am still getting gas in the crankcase over
and over again, so, obviously I'm doing something wrong.

Is there any indication, then, at the two gauges I have, oil pressure and
temp-wise, when generally that the "choke is off?"

Worse, if not, what criteria *should* I use?

Thanks, all. Tried finding this in the library / archives but wasn't
successful.
