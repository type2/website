The past week or so, the wife and I were really thinking about heading up for the weekend.  She heads back to work at the end of April, and we we hoping to get out and about before doing so.

With all this negative talk.....I am definately reconsidering the trip.  I just can't see driving that far and not being able to get into the show.  Camping with a wife and two kids....the word 'early' left my vocabulary years ago!

Now the question is--Corona de Tuscon or SV2's club campout??
