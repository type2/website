Both the solenoid and the ignition coil seem to work well even though they
are 6v running on 12v.  I have converted 6v heaters for a long time without
any problems from either the coil or the solenoid.  But if they do ever have
a problem, or quit working, I have the 12v fuel solenoid on my web page
(which drops right in place of the 6v) for a really inexpensive price and
the ignition coil is the same as you run on a bug or bus.  I know many
people love the Eberspacher heaters and really they are a great unit, but
working with, working on and getting parts for the South Winds is pretty
easy.
