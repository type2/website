Alright after gaining more insights into the remarkable world of Porsche and
VW from our friends at Old Speed I have some neat information to report
back.

1.  The 944 and late split (64-67) share the same front wheel bearings.  But
no, the 944 rotor will not directly bolt up to the split spindle w/o some
"help".

2.  The bay window master cylinder has a 24mm piston instead of the 22mm
found in the stock split master cylinders.  It is reported that if you plan
on upgrading to the dual circuit bay MC that pedal effort will be increased.
Since the bay was designed with vacuum assist in mind the extra pedal effort
was never felt by the user...  Now I know why my friends in bay w/o the
vacuum attached complain about stiff brakes :) (and I just thought they were
wussies).  Anyone care to comment on this?

3.  For those who have eliminated RGBs and gone with Beetle T1 rear drums it
is reported that the front brake cylinders are 22mm and work better on a bus
than the stock T1 rear 20(?)mm units.  Should be a direct swap.


That is about all I can think of to pass on... Hopefully someone is
benefited by this ramble :)  Call Old Speed if you are interested in a easy
Porsche front disc conversion for a split.  They have been very helpful to
me and recommend them for your custom needs as well.
