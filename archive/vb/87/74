Your oil pressure gauge and oil temp gauge can certainly tell you when
your engine is warmed up, but they don't tell you what your choke is
doing. For that you have to put down the phone, turn off the stereo,
and listen. You can hear the idle drop as it bumps down each of those
little steps on the fast idle cam. When it stops dropping you've
gotten all the work you are going to get out of your choke until it
cools down again. If you are not confident the choke has unloaded,
just run around back and look at the fast idle cam. If you really want
a gauge to tell you, you could get a tachometer.
Got carb preheater, thermostat and flaps? Those are vital to speedy
warming.
Warming up the car is a good thing, but why have you set upon this as
the cause of gas in the oil?

In 15-degree, cold, stultifyingly black mornings up here in Reno, Nev,
just
how long *should* one warm up a relatively new (c. 1999) 1600cc engine
in a
vintage bus (c. 1967)?

From my previous bus' experience that I had for 20 years (in the same
locale), I'd always given it five minutes and then it's off we go,
slow
RPM's first, then up to speed. It was always ample for said previous
bus.
Never, in 20 years, ever had a problem, engine after engine.

With this bus, this isn't working. Gas is *repeatedly* contaminating
the
crankcase oil, after the five-minute warm-up.

The carburetor choke checks completely operational.

Stumped, I took it to people who are paid to work on these things and
was
told to warm it up til the choke is off.

That's great, but how does one ascertain this? *I'm* looking at two
gauges:
0-80 PSI oil pressure and 120-300-degree F oil temperature. Presently,
after
warming up for five minutes, I am still getting gas in the crankcase
over
and over again, so, obviously I'm doing something wrong.

Is there any indication, then, at the two gauges I have, oil pressure
and
temp-wise, when generally that the "choke is off?"

Worse, if not, what criteria *should* I use?

Thanks, all. Tried finding this in the library / archives but wasn't
successful.
