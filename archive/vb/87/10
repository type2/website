Subject: Re: [VB] Red Barn / KelleyPark FYI

This whole Kelley Park thing is way out of hand.   The wait to get
into the show is now almost equal to the length of the show.
The process for getting into the show is painfully slow.  We
can thank the CalLook punk crowd for their burnouts which don't
let us park on the lawn any more.  People are having to line up
earlier and earlier, which can only go on for so long before SJPD
starts making a fuss - and maybe they already have...

The show *has* to change.  Period.  Not open for debate.   It can't 
continue in it's current format.  The number of cars is growing and 
the area to put them is shrinking.  Don't give me the lines about
how it's put on by a loving club and they work hard, yada yada yada.
Yes, I know. But it's still broke.

Here are some options, off the top of my head:

* make it a *truly* vintage show.  67 & earlier (maybe even 60 and
earlier).  Get rid of the late models.  

* make it a real car show - use pre-registration to get the
docket lined up in advance, park everyone else in some secure,
offsite parking.

* move the show.  Yes, that sucks, but it's a simple matter of how
many cars you can fit in a given area.  You either increase the area,
or shrink the numbers of cars.

* at the *very* least, streamline the admission process.  You
shouldn't have to stop and talk to 4 different people on the way in.

Having the swap in the lower lot was good, as it relieved some of the
congestion, but it was a MAJOR PITA to traverse between the two.
It was, in essence, two separate shows.  If that's not the case
this year, they're doomed.   The parking lot on the north side would
make more sense, but I guess they can't use that for social/economic/political
reasons.

Offsite parking has to have *real* security.  From what I've seen
in the past few years, I would *NOT* park my bus in one of those lots.
You're just *begging* to get stuff stolen, particularly with the popularity
of the online fencing sites.

I've been debating whether I actually want to go or not.
