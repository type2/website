Subject: 62-71 T/L assemblies

   Thanks to all that bought the tail light assemblies. The good news is I
was able to get more and can continue to offer them at $35.00 dollars a
pair, these are complete assemblies with the 2 wire pigtail out the back.
They come complete with housing, seal, lens and bezel. I don't know if I
will be able to get any more of these
