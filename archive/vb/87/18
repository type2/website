Well put Thom.
 I didn't go last year because of the wait to get in. 
The year before (2000) that they had to turn people
away at the gates after they waited for hours to get
in. I remember when that show was 50 cars!
 I will go to BYOB, but more than likely will pass on
Kelley Park. It's a shame that they don't have shows
at the Pleasanton fairgrounds anymore. That was a
great place even though it was put on by the Goodguys.
If only we could all ban together and put on our
shows...
