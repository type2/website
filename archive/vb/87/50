Subject: SOTO is Back, eh?


I'm seeing rumblings on the 'net that SOTO is back.
Is it relevant?  How many bus clubs can SoCal support?   
OCTO, NEATO, SV2 (aren't they in SoCal?).   It seemed
to me to be that OCTO was the be-all/end-all, with
the backing of the biggest names in da bidness.

If you have (let's say) 5 bus clubs, and everyone in
a given geographic area is in each of the clubs, do
you really have 5 clubs?

If a bus A leaves Seattle travelling at 105kph, and
bus B leaves Lake Havasu travelling at 120kph...

Ramblings of a sleepy systems administrator...
