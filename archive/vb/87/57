That degreaser sounds like the stuff I picked up at Lowes a week or so ago.
I had my belly pan off when I was replacing the drag link and it was full of
(35 years worth of) nasties.  I hit it with this stuff and took a wire brush
to it.  I finished up with a quick coat of primer followed by a 96 cent can
of cheap flat black enamal.  What a difference it made!!

I got some industrial degreaser cleaner at Costco (they also have it at Home
Depot) in the floor cleaning supply section. I don't dilute it just spray it
on straight and let it soak, then hose it off. Works great and is 7 dollars
a gallon!

ronnie   the original! not the other
