Subject: Re: [VB] Trailer Wiring Question


Ok, I just went and did a couple of tests.

I don't think it's a ground

With the headlights *off,* everything works
perfectly - left and right blinkers work
like they should.

With the headlights *on*: left blinker works
perfectly.  Right blinker does it's funky 
off-beat dance - *and* the right blinker
only works with the trailer connected - if I
disconnect the trailer, the blinker stops
working!

I'm outta daylight, and don't feel like taking
the rack off to get the bus into the garage.
