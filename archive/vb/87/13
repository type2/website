Hi Ronnie,
Well there were the VOA trucker mirrors that bolted to the doors.  Good luck 
finding a pair since these have become very rare!  You did check the mirrors 
you took off for a VOA stamping in the forward side?!  
  To remove the hinge pin you need to soak the hinge/s every day for weeks to 
even months.  Then have a helper hold a piece of at least 1/2" thick plywood 
over the door below the hinge while you hammer a punch up the underside of 
the pin.  If it is really stuck and you plan on repainting it anyway you 
could heat the hinge up and quench it with cold water to break up the rust in 
there.  Just do not heat the hinge to red hot!
