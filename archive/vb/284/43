Subject: Bus Depot Now Has Metric Hardware & Chemicals

Just a quick note that we have added to our offerings some of the more
popular standard hardware and chemicals used on VW's  - such as bulk
packs of metric nuts & bolts, plus German sealants, grease, additives,
and of course POR-15.  These may save you a trip to the store when you
install your new parts. When you click on the vehicle type (i.e. '50-67
BUS) you'll now see a CHEMICALS & STANDARD HARDWARE parts category.  Or
if you prefer a direct link...
