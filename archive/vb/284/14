I think the peace loving fellow started the thread discussing selling his
bug, didn't he? Bugs are VW's and busses are VW's aren't they? Therefore
bugs must be busses, right? Isn't that a math theorem or something? Oh well.

Cops do good things and cops do bad things. Bad things like chasing down law
abiding citizens to enhance the revenue of the local PD. But we sure would
be in a mess without them wouldn't we?

I've been trying to write a response that is something more than a flame
since I read this. Let me try this:
  The "not a fan comment" indicates you need to spend some time thinking
about the trash they deal with every day. Might make you a bit more
understanding and willing to help them out and you might develop a more
mature attitude about the difficult job that puts them in life
threatening situations every day. Just my thoughts
