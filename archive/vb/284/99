  VW Sawmills. Today I sold some parts to a logger in Washington/Oregon. He
proceeded to tell me of all the portable saw mills in these 2 states that
are powered by VW industrial engines. The parts he ordered were for a 40 hp
industrial engine but he proceeded to tell me about the 36 hp and 1600 cc
powered ones. He is sending me pics of his and a friends IN USE today and
also is looking through his spares for some extra magneto's and other odd
parts that he doesn't need anymore.

ps. Everett needs to start another cat in the gallery for VW powered
equipment. Ricks weed sprayer, snow cats, saw mills, refer truck units, fire
pumps, generators, tractors, Zambonies and all the other VW powered
equipment out there.
