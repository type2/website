Per http://gutefahrt.com/radio/blaupunkt.html , I'd say it's a 1954-1960
Blaupunkt Frankfurt.  Mostly because it seems like only that model had
the "split" bezel with B L A U P U N K T on the bar between the dial and
the pushbuttons, and also because of the pushbutton order.  The site says
the first Frankfurts had U U M M L pushbuttons, which corresponds to the
FM FM AM AM M buttons your radio has.  (Yours was probably built
specifically for the North American market, with AM and FM on the buttons.)

I hope this helps!
