Subject: Re: [VB] Yet another tranny question!

Billy-
I already bought A full rebuild gasket set last week. I just figured since I 
basicly have the whole thing apart I'll just use it as an excuse to open the 
tranny all the way up and make sure everythings fine in it.
I talked to the guy at the import shop and he told me how to get the case 
open... So  I guess I'll have a 10 or 12 hour project for this weekend!! 
Thanks again though about the gaskets.
Kelly
