Subject: Re: [VB] Quick VIN question

Yeah, if the vin starts with 227; then it should be a '67 bench seat
standard.  You can assume anything you want about the bus, it just won't
necessarily be correct.  But in this case, I would say that it'd be safe to
assume that it's set up for 12 volt.  Don't know of many people that would
take a stock 12 volt bus and convert it to 6 volt.
