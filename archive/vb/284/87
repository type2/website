Subject: Cool new toy find

Hey all you VW toy collectors,
  I found a cool new toy today while waiting for my tire balancing at Walmart.  Corgi has a new series of "Fighting Machine" die cast vehicles.  2 of the 3 left were kubelwagens.  I bought both ( $3.88 ).  I was quite surprised to find them.  I was even more surprised that they have a small swastika on the side, not very PC these days.  One of them will now reside next to my bus collection.
  Bus content - I just finished installing Time-serts in my RGB's today, so I should be putting my trans back in within the next week or so.
