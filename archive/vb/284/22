Subject: Towing my 67

Hi all,
	My 67 bus needs to be towed to her new home. I had removed, a
long time ago, the left rear backing plate, brakes and rear reduction
box cover. As in the cover and seal. I have replaced the cover, put
the gasket on and need to tighten it up. It appears that most, if not
all, of the oil for the box leaked out. Now, if I am towing the bus,
front wheels up, rear down, for about 8 miles, max speed about 50
mph, should I worry about refilling the box to ensure nothing seizes?
Or is it safe to tow this short distance and speed. Engine is out.
	Thanks for the help.
	Mike
	67 Deluxe bus
