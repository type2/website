Subject: Re: [VB] Quick VIN question

I will skip the long story but I was on the phone with customer service at VOA
reporting a problem with the service dept at a local dealership.  She kept
telling me that the VIN number on my bus registration was wrong, said it
should be longer and have letters or something like that, I wasn't paying her
much attention .. basically she was an idiot .. diane

  they started the 9 digit vin that tells model and year in 65, in 57 it was
  just what number bus was made.   This confuses my insurance company when I
reel
  off a 6 digit VIN for my 61, but whatever.
