Subject: Steering Wheel thingy

So I have my steering wheel off and I pulled that thing that screws on the
bottom of the steering wheel with the 3 screws.  It has a metal kinda tab
thing on it.  So when I put the steering wheel back on the column the slot in
the steering wheel lines up with the key on the column - that's easy - but in
which direction does that metal tab go relative to the slot in the steering
wheel.  I realize this email is confusing but I'm sure someone must know what
I'm talking about.

TIA
