Subject: Quick VIN question

I just picked up a bus (no title) that the PO thought
was a 64.
However, upon receiving the bus, I see the VIN number
starts with "227". This can only mean that the bus is
a 57,67,or 77, right? (A 67 in this case).
And assuming that the bus is indeed a 67 (the M-code
plate begins with "01 9" indicating it was built
January 9, 1967, correct?? So should I assume from
this code information that the tranny and all the
electricals in this bus are set up for a 12 Volt system.
