I've been trying to write a response that is something more than a flame
since I read this. Let me try this:
  The "not a fan comment" indicates you need to spend some time thinking
about the trash they deal with every day. Might make you a bit more
understanding and willing to help them out and you might develop a more
mature attitude about the difficult job that puts them in life
threatening situations every day. Just my thoughts
