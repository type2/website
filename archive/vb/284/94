These people are like weeds. I send them mail saying that
these auctions are against ebay policy; you cannot sell
CD-Rs compiled from information from the web, especially
if you don't hold the copyright.  No one ever replies.
Its too much trouble to report each one to eBay to have
it removed.
I guess that if one in ten of the auctions ends in a sale,
the rip off guys make money.
