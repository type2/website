Hi Jason,
Take a look at the images in section M-20, page 1 it shows the nine spring 
211 141 025 A.  Those round canister things between the TO arms are where the 
coil type springs are mounted/housed.  The six spring clutch 211 141 025 D just 
has six of these canisters.  The diaphram type clutch 211 141 025 B is shown 
in the parts manual which can be viewed through vintagebus.com website along 
with the afore mentioned clutch PPs.
