New beetles (including the exclusive Target Thanksgiving 2000 hand-out) old beetles, bajas, golfs ,and buses. Nothing real hard to find, just some extras that I found in one of the many boxes of crap I have still... 42 cars in all and I'm sure they will go for less than what I would like to get...(I'm raising money for my Novemberfest trip)
