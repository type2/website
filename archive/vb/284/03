Subject: Re: [VB] Bit of a find

fromt the back hatch its pre-64.   From the dash it's april 61/earlier.  From 
the high hinge cargo doors, it's nov 60 or earlier.  From the flat decklid 
it's mid 57 through 58.  I'd guess some PO changed taillight and turnsignals.

M code plates were started about early 59. or was it early 60?  The metal tag 
with vin # on it is inthe engine compartment, and the VIN is stamped in the 
flat area between engine and battery.

I'd save it if the body is half decent,   If you have room for a spare bus.  
They make good storage sheds.  In any case, high hinge side doors, flat 
decklids & early pop out latches, the all chrome kind,  aren't getting any easier to 
find.  front bumper if it's there , the thin kind with the pressed out bit at 
each side.  And of course, safaris.  early shift linkage is hard to find too. 
  

I think if a bus is so bad it gets crushed, it could at least be an organ 
donor.

It also has the narrow rear door which I thought was
pre-64 but it has the newer indicators on the front.
Any ideas?

I'm stumped.
The sad thing is it is heading for the crusher in 2
weeks.
Should I grab it?
I'm not real inspired as it seems like a bit of a dead
loss per its condition plus it's sitting between 2
very swampy sections of ground.
