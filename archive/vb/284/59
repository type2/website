I didn't know there was a dif between them. I was using the one I had with my
stock 34 PICT-3 with the Progressive and didn't seem to have a problem.

What are the prices now? I paid $119 for my SVDA 6 years ago and $80 for my
dual point .050.

71 Trike 1776cc Dual T-4 34 PDSIT-3
VolksAir 1585cc 31 PICT

Progressive
Stock FI T1 and T2's (works with aircooled vanagons as well)
Dual carbs (vacuum signal from two cylinders)
34 Pict
31 Pict and 30/31 Brosol

These are re-curved to meet our specs for the above applications to take out
any guesswork for setting them up right,
