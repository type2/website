replace parts and fill with oil.   lack of lubrication wears the parts, and 
causes damage, shortening its useful life.

all, of the oil for the box leaked out. Now, if I am towing the bus,
front wheels up, rear down, for about 8 miles, max speed about 50
mph, should I worry about refilling the box to ensure nothing seizes?
Or is it safe to tow this short distance and speed. Engine is out.
    Thanks for the help.
