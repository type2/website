Your signature reminds me of going to an Arlo Guthrie concert in Miami -
sometime in the 70's -
He came on the stage and I believe his VERY FIRST WORDS were "... want to
start off by saying
I am NOT going to do Alice's Restaurant tonight ... "

I got up and left ...  Diane

You are driving down the Highway of Life. .
You spot another VW in the opposite lane ...
As you pass,hands go up ...
Eye contact is made and you both smile ...
VW's are more than just transportation ...
They're your soul, your inner peace ...
and sometimes your worst nightmare.

  "So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the
implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's
station..."
