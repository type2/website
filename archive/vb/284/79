A few years back, at least, there was a driving range on the east side of
I-470/MO-291 between I-70 and US-50 in Lee's Summit, Missouri (a suburb of
Kansas City) that had a few working Bugs.  One had a body and had some kind
of rake or scoop that was bolted to the hood (!) and front bumper and hung
out in front of the car; I think it was used to retrieve balls from the
range.  There were a couple of pans with engines that were visible from
the road, but I don't know what they were for... they didn't seem to have
any extra hardware; perhaps they were just spares for the one good body.
