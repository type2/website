Subject: Got snaffled - was: Bit of a find

Well, I will learn.
I hopped in the car today and drove 2 hours to find a
guy had already scored the safaris.
On the plus side I managed to score three pieces of
window glass(sekurit), a headlight switch knob(which I
needed) and an early model popout latch in quite good
condition.
So for those with amazing offers on the safaris
they've gone to a guy in Canberra!
I'm not sure if he was lurking on this list or just
saw the bus by the side of the freeway.
Either way it's a bit of a wrench.
But I'm not so sad.
The owner of the wrecking yard had to cut the A-pillar
to get the left hand safari out and I can tell you
that anyone scoring these would have a STACK of
careful welding and restoring ahead of them.
A closer look at the inside had worse surprises & the
only good popout had also been taken.
Personally I believe it would've been pretty dodgy
too.
It'll teach me to keep my cards close to my chest
though.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
