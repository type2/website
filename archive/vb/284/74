Greasy Volks,

For as long as I have been working here, the university has had 3 bug
pans sans bodies, for practical use around the campus.  One belongs to
the Physical Plant paint shop, and they use it to paint the road traffic
lines and curbs on the myraid streets on and around campus.  The other
two are used to paint the lines and hash marks on the football practice
and stadium fields, as well as for soccer, field hockey and rugby. 

Has anyone seen an application like this, or is it unique?  

BTW, muh beloved Cougs got kilted last night by them d*mned Rams of CSU
just over on the east side of the Rockies, 58-13 . . .  snif, snif.  But
just you wait, the Ewtes of the UofU are coming down on the 22nd Nov.,
right Tom?  Ask Mike Anderson if he's seen this application at the Ewe
of Ewe.  Anyone else?

Best,

Curt
