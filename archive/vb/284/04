Don't call your local police, call the local FBI office.

Or, if you don't like using the phone, deposit the check.  The bank will
contact the FBI for you when it bounces or is discovered to be a forgery
(and not in a good way).  Your account will be debited for the typical
"bounced
check" fees as well.
