Subject: SVDA distributors in stock

We were on back order for a few weeks, but wanted to let everyone know we have
them back in stock.

We have 5 different applications avaliable depending on what your engine is
running:

Progressive
Stock FI T1 and T2's (works with aircooled vanagons as well)
Dual carbs (vacuum signal from two cylinders)
34 Pict
31 Pict and 30/31 Brosol

These are re-curved to meet our specs for the above applications to take out
any guesswork for setting them up right, so you can install it, and be done
with it (no adjusting anything after the timing is set).

Sorry for the 'spammy-ness' of this, but I knew there were a number of people
that were waiting for these to get back in stock.
