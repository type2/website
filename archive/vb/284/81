Bus content:  I have in my possession a neat VW sales aid from the 
mid-60s, "Comparing the Competition with Volkswagen Trucks" (marked 
'CONFIDENTIAL"!!).  It gives salesmen point-by-point instructions on how 
to favorably compare VW commercials to various models of Corvair/Corvan 
and Ford Econoline commercials.  Sadly, they don't seem to think the 
homely Dodge A-100 van series was worthy of mention...
