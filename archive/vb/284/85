Subject: looking for info on this radio

It's a Blaupunkt 3 band that came out of my 61 Rustfalia...looking for any info... where to get parts, who can "restore" to working condition (I have never put it to power so I don't know if it works) and maybe model name or possible age?
Not looking to sell it... unless you REALLY want it.
