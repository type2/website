According to the Bentley (page H-6 3), those are the nuts on the drive
pinion and main drive shaft.  You can take them off, but then there
are about ten more steps (including removing the differential) before
you can take the transmission out of the rear axle.

You might take off the nuts on the studs around the outside -- the
ones around the joint you're trying to get at, a few inches back from
where the nose cone bolts on -- and make sure the studs are tight in
the case.  Then torque the nuts back down to 14 lb. ft.  If that
doesn't stop any leaks around that joint, you might need professional
help.
