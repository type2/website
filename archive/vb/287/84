Cal,

I haven't touched any of the linkage except of course for the coupler to the trans.

I figured it would require some adjustment. I know the adjustment process for baywindows, is it the same?

Can someone fill me in before I get the Bentley for 
x-mas?!

I really think it's in the nosecone, unfortunately. It's so hard to shift, that I don't think it could be simple adjustment, but I guess I should try first.

Also, doesn't matter whether engine is running or not, hard shifting both ways. Points to trans.

Billy
