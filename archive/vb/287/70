Subject: '65 new trans-trouble

Listees,

My new transmission is installed, engine running, but extremely difficult to shift into gear.

I have gotten it into 2nd and R, and moved the bus back and forth, but it is no way close to acceptable for driving yet.

Short synopsis:

Clutch: reused all existing gear, have tried adjusting the clutch cable settings, no avail. Currently set to 1/2" play at the pedal

Trans: new 12V from rancho. reused my nosecone/hockey stick assembly, new rear mounts, reused front. GL4 in the case. I believe we put it in neutral when we installed the nosecone.

also: have some gear oil leaking on both sides. seems to be from the side case seals, not the axle retaining ring, but the case itself. The trans is clean on the sides by the retaining ring. Only fluid is on very bottom of case at case seal.

Linkage: unchanged, reused coupler after cleaning it up some. No adjustments at gearshift.

I appreciate your help. It's been six weeks and I want to get on the road asap! I can acquire any additional parts recommended this week.

Billy
