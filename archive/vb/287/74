Subject: Re: [VB] Battery Repair?

Wal-Mart is a good place to get a new battery.  If you ever have a battery
problem that is under it's warranty, no matter where you are, there's a
WallyWorld close by to take care of you. You never have to worry about
finding a certain auto parts store if you're on a trip in another city/state
and need the battery taken care of.
