Yup, though, since I rebuilt the entire harness from scratch back in the
resto days, from mil-spec space-flight qualified teflon coated stranded
heavy guage wiring, the wiring will prolly be non-suspect long after I'm
gone. The connectors are another thing, of course, but I checked them and
the soldering as well - they're all doing well.
Thanks for asking! The extra input is always appreciated - you never know
when a neuron will quit firing, and someone's suggestion will save a day!
