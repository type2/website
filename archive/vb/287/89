Oh, that bus is just too cool.  I count parts of four buses (one
perhaps a splittie) and one bug.  It would have been so cool if he had
continued the double-decker baywindow theme on the top instead of grafting
on the bug.

It apparently has a drum brake front end which should make those downhills
quite sporting.  I wonder where it is now?
