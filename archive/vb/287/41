Subject: Re: [VB] Shift Coupler - HELP!

Andrew, I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that you've just had the gear
stick in the wrong position when you were putting it back together.

Check your manual ( Bentleys or other ), and the procedure for fitting the
coupler will state " put gearstick in" 2nd/3rd or whatever.

If you undo it coupler, put the gearstick in the correct position & then
re-tighten it, it SHOULD engage all gears.

One of the more experienced guys will, I'm sure, come back on this, but I'm
pretty sure that's what the problem is.
