Subject: water rotted case/ was vw auction

I got the original motor with my 57 deluxe, still std/std but unfortunantly
it has some pretty bad water rot in the bottom, limited to the area right
around the drain plate.
Is there anyway to repair the damaged section reliably? Can someone with the
skills actually weld another little bit in from a good case? Is there some
other method of filling the damage in? I'd love to put the og motor back in.
