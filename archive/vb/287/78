I'd prolly try setting the battery on the opposite side, to stop the drip.
Then clean up the mess around the hole with water, and then isopropyl
alcohol, then rough up the plastic around the hole with fine sandpaper,
clean that off, and then either:

use some good epoxy glue over the whole roughed up area, or

find a good patching material, such as thin neoprene sheet, cut a one
inch square, rough it up on one surface, and apply a good quality contact
cement to the roughed up battery surface and the roughed up side of the
sheet material, wait 15 minutes, and patch it. Let it dry for a full day
before setting the battery down again. And clean up the spillage that has
already occured in the bus, or it'll rust up quickly.
