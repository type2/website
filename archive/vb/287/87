Subject: Re: [VB] '65 new trans-trouble

1. Remove the shifter in the cab.

2. Disconnect the coupler again and make sure that the securing bolt is
correctly engaging the depression in the rear shift rod and the transmission
shift lever.

3. Go to the front of the bus and attempt to manually engage all four gears
using the front shift lever that is now disconnected from the shifter in the
cab.

4. If you can engage all four gears using this method then your problem is
in the shifter in te cab. If you still cannot engage all four gears, the
problem is in the transmission shift lever or the sliders in the
transmission.

I haven't touched any of the linkage except of course for the coupler to the
trans.

I figured it would require some adjustment. I know the adjustment process
for baywindows, is it the same?

Can someone fill me in before I get the Bentley for
x-mas?!

I really think it's in the nosecone, unfortunately. It's so hard to shift,
that I don't think it could be simple adjustment, but I guess I should try
first.

Also, doesn't matter whether engine is running or not, hard shifting both
ways. Points to trans.
