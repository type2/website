Use the pre heat that picks up off the right heater box.   means the rear tin has no holes except for fresh air.   Same shape as the small preheat tin, but no hole.   front tin does have hole in it.   see p k-2 16

Probably best to find pics from an owners manual

Or from the original workshop manual on the pages dated 11/66
