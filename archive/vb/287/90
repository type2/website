Hey Y'all,
I have just been notified by Bus Depot that a little
part I need is not available. It is the little
thrust\cup spacer that goes on the outside of the
generator pulley on an upright engine (the thing just
under the pulley nut).
Has anyone got one of these they would be willing to
sell\trade me. I have a ton of late bay parts I can
trade (switches, ash trays, dizzy vac cans, handles,
etc..) or I will give you what BD charges for a new
plus shipping.
Thanks!
