Subject: Some guy's pictures

Volk-a-maniacs,

I ran across this in a random search and think they are worth a smirk and
maybe even a chuckle.  Give the pictures at this location a looksey.  All but
one are VW monsters and the one might be a VW on the inside.  I like the
VW-copter.

Have a good day.
