The flex hose suggestion was good.  old flex hoses are a PITA.   

other thing that can happen is that the shoe end might not be set down into the cylinder slot, but turned slightly.  

also, sometimes the shoe have to set into the middle.   a few stomps on the brakes should do this, then sometimes it needs readjusting.
