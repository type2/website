Subject: Type 2 Reduction Boxes

I have a pair of reduction boxes that I acquired with a project car, they are
off a Type 2 but I don't know what sort they are.  They look to be in
fantastic condition with virtually no use visible, can anyone give me any
information on how to identify them and of anyone who could make use of what I
assume are a rare item.

Thanks for your help
