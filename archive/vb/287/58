Subject: parcel tray vinyl

So I'm in the process of puttin' my bus together and I'm about to put my
parcel tray back in.  The vinyl is ... ok but I'm going to try and find
something close and use that.

Did all buses have two pieces of vinyl in the parcel tray - or was it more a
delux/standard thing?  Did kombis and panel vans have that vinyl?

just curious
