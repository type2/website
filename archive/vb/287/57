Subject: Windshield Goo Removal Tip

I took a big step a few days ago and I am 
now committed to the reinstallation and
clean-up of gutters and windshield seal 
area before it rains. 

I took out the windshield.

It had been installed and covered over
with many compounds and goos in a feeble
attempt to keep it from leaking over
many years.

I scraped this heavy accumulation of odd
materials as best I could with wooden
Popsicle sticks to avoid scratching the
paint, but a lot remained.

The remaining residual was enough that
solvent would take a really long time
and a lot of solvent.

I had been working in the shade, and as
time passed the goo came into the sunlight
and it softened. I took the hint and grabbed
my wife's hair dryer and hit the goo with it
and found that it softened up enough to wipe
off with a paper towel!

Within a short period of time I was able to 
easily remove the goo. I, of course, had to
use solvent to finish it off.

Jeff - hoping it won't rain until I have
everything primed, sealed, painted and the
windshield buttoned up.
Yeah, it's not a bus, but it's of a similar
vintage and other than those folks in Arizona,
the use of heat may not have been obvious for
sealant removal
