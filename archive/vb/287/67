Subject: 67 engine sheet metal

Since I'm putting this stock 1484 motor together for later use in the truck if
I sell it, is there anyplace that has a good pictorial of what the original
sheet metal looks like for this motor. I would like to have it as close as
possible. Half, no, three quarters of the sheet metal I have is bug stuff
because that's where most of my used motors come from.
