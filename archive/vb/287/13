oooh yeah - bought a trailer full of supposed 'good' 36hp motors and 
a few boxes of misc parts -  $180. all the cases turned out to be 
water-rotted inside... junk.  but i found an oval bug coathook in a 
box that won nearly double that on *bay!

if you can pick up a box of 'junk' cheap, go for it.
