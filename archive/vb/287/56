How many people will catch that GL reference?  :)

From the looks of the pictures, they look like something made to hold the
edge of something (gates, perhaps?) a set distance away from something
else that has a ridge running along that the two "feet" can straddle.  The
threaded T-handle whatsits look like they thread into the two hook
parts, perhaps as a height adjuster?

They don't really look "finished" enough to be factory tooling, but who
know?
