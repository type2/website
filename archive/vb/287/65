Hi Cal,
Did you check the wiring at the starter and ignition switch?  A friend of 
our's years ago had the same thing happen due to bad wiring in the ignition 
switch area.  She had to push start it to get down to our place where we helped her 
pull the engine and sat her down to hand file the FW teeth which had been 
mushroomed over.  Two hours later she had a nice FW again and she was very 
motivated to do full wiring repair on her bus.
