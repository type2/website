Bob,

Cool pict.  Any others have picts. of misc. air-cooled apps?

Bob, I hope this baby wasn't the sawmill that started the big
Jellystone fire back in '88!  We'll never live it down if it did!  Oh,
you said '98.  Okay.

A friend drove up to the very top of I-15 and then west down I-90 for a
cool bike ride on the new Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes Trail, . . . 72
miles, paved, bikes and rollerblades only.  We did not see a single
air-cooled along the way.  Nary a one, nope, not even a Bug.  What is
going on up there?  We decided it was a cool trip but we both need to
get our 70's Westy's on the road, we'd have been warmer and dryer.  Trip
would have taken longer though.  ;-}

Curt
