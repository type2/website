Hi Andrew,
We also have never heard of RGBs breaking in anyway except due to poor 
maintenance.  On the other hand we were at a Texas VW meet near Dallas when a swing 
axle bug broke one axle on the drag strip.  Sounded like a ear splitting fire 
alarm from Hades and we were quite a ways from the track when let loose!

  Like Clara says, the RGB gears are alot thicker and beefier than any of the 
center section tranny gears, but when drag racing anything can possibly break.

  We got to see the remains of a swing axle tranny that a friend of our's 
broke when he tromped on the gas to show off his newly installed type 4, 2 liter 
engine in his split screen bus.  The rear wheels popped the rear of the bus 
slightly into the air and when it came back down the high RPMing tires bit into 
the pavement.  The torque energy was so much the R&P pushed the tranny case 
apart left to right just forward of the axle tubes!
