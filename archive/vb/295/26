Do you have good experience with cleaning off clutch discs?
Hi Dave,
We have used Brake Klean to degrease oily clutch parts, with great results.  
Do not let the chemical get on your skin or it tends to peel it off in chunks 
later!  As long as you have not slipped the clutch too much and kept the 
pressure plate from heating up so much as to blue it and heat treat the spring out 
of it.
