The South African Fleetlines were one year only: 1975. The
1975 model year ran from August 1974 to July 1975. VWSA
assembled only 789 of these throwback splitties from
Brazilian SKD or CKD kits.

The VINs on Fleetlines (note this name applies only to these
75 Brazilian splits, and not any other) do not follow the
usual German pattern. All the Fleetlines I've seen have VINs
starting with 205 (maybe signifying type 2, RHD???), with
the fourth digit signifying the model, the 3 in your case
signifies a Kombi. Panelvan would be 1 and pick-up
(wide-body single cab) 6. The rest of the numbers are
sequential production numbers, so your Kombi was probably
number 155 of 789.

It's also interesting to note that the Fleetlines did not
have the VIN stamped anywhere on the body -- the only record
of it is on the plate behind the driver's seat. Well worth
getting it stamped if you own a Fleetline!

The Fleetlines were sold as economy models alongside VWSA's
regular production of German-built bay-window buses. For the
1976-78 model years they dropped the split windscreen and
introduced the fugly, bizarre Brazilian hybrid with the bay
front grafted onto the splitty rear end. Fleetline has been
used as a model name previously by Chevrolet, Daimler and
Leyland!

I hope this little essay is useful to anyone who is
interested in these unique SA Fleetlines.

Jean, please pmail me off list so we can talk SA buses!
