Subject: Be careful out there--

Bessie is almost out of the hospital, and on the road again--Nasty thing
with her tranny--about 10,000 miles ago a "friend"? rebuilt the tranny and
installed a 3.88 R&P.--But after about 8000 miles or so Bessie started to
howl in her tranny--I contacted the rebuilder, a friend I have known and a
local, for some 13+ years--But no luck with him checking out the
tranny--finally no contact--So I felt I was taken--Took the tranny to long
time Phoenix builder and friend Tom Bowman--Lots of "Stuff" in the tranny
was not set right--also the main shaft bearing was no good--And guess
what ---- NO 3.88 R&P !!--- Even though I paid for it !! Bummer-
In trying to help a friend--He helped himself to my wallet !! double bummer,
