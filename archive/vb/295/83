Subject: 67 Middle Seat (again)

Hiya Gang,
Once again, a 67 Middle Seat question.

I've heard that the middle seat in a 67 Standard/Deluxe/Samba is a
one-year-only seat.

If this is true, does anyone know the difference between this seat and an
earlier one?

Also, if the middle seat is different, is the rear seat the same?

Thanks for your help.

Ed
