Hi Billy,
Did you install new rubber boots on the front and rear of the tube the rear 
shift rod passes through??  Without these the dirt, rust will come back with a 
vengence.  Wolfburg West had them last time we did the same.
  Good to hear you have the tranny in properly.  Yes, it does take time to do 
it just so, but it will run right and last alot looonnnngggeeerrr!
