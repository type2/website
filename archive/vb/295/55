Try to open the case up, arefully, clean all the gears and put back
together, makes for a smoother running motor in the cold months, and quieter
motor overall.

Ok after 2.5 years I'm starting to put things in the Bus to stay and make it
drivable.  I'm putting the Wiper motor in next week and starting putting
everything in it.

Is there any think I should do to the motor before I put it in?  Like clean
the motor or lube any parts?
