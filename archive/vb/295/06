Subject: Convert late bay tranny to swingaxle?

Hi All,

There is bus content here..... just. I have a friend who is on the
board of the South African Formula Vee Association. Vee is single seat
racing with a space frame chassis, beetle front end, beetle trany(mouned
back to front with crown wheel flipped to give mid engined
configuration) and a tweaked 1300cc Golf engine. These small light cars
hit 120 + mph depending on gearing and provide cheaper racing than small
bore karts.

Beetle tranny parts are getting scarce and pricy and they are looking
for alternatives. Here is the question:

Has anyone any experience with converting a late model bay window
tranny to accept swingaxle sideshafts? Can it be done? If it could be
done at all this would be the route to follow as Vee is all about racing
on the lowest possible budget. Converting the cars to IRS would add to
the expense as the rear ends of the cars use the swingaxle as a
suspension link.

If this could be done they would farm the work out to a commercial
tranny supplier who would be contracted to supply 65 odd converted
trannys.

Any pmail  info would be greatly appreciated.

Michael
