Subject: Re: [VB] Convert late bay tranny to swingaxle?

Hi E&B,

Having trannies built in the US and exported to South Africa would
unfortunately be prohibitively expensive. We have a weakish currency (the
Rand) which trades at around 7 to the Dollar. From looking at prices for stock
rebuilt bus trannies from suppliers in the US it looks like the tranny would
end up costing around 50% of the South African build price of a car before any
modifications from standard spec.

The question was really just a wild flyer and I didn't really expect it to be
a straight bolt on type conversion - just kinda hoped.

Since it is Friday..... the German Formula V champion's car was built in South
Africa. I thought that was kinda funny - back to the fatherland and all.

Michael
