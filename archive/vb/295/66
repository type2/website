I had a similar hole on my 60 kombi and found an antenna to fit it nicely
for $6-8 at bi-mart. They keep them on the same isle as the fuzzy dice and
skull shaped valve stem caps. Pretty decent looking realy, here's a picture
of the bus w/ antenna

Anyone know of an antenna that would fit this hole as I don't want to
> drill anywhere else thru the metal to mount the typical type 2 antennas.
Thank you!
