How can I tell what kind of wheel I have?
Hi Kevin,
First you need to measure the outer diameter which will be about 1" bigger 
than the tire that seats on it.  Next does it have five of four lug bolt holes 
in it?  Does it have riveted hub cap clips?  Also look for the rim measurements 
which should be stamped somewhere between the lugbolt holes.  Lastly are 
there any slots between the inner and outer parts of the rim?
