Subject: Re: [VB] Redux Boxes?

Well, I was talking to Jake Raby at a show a few months ago, telling him
about putting a type 4 in my bus; and he said that I would need to do
something about the redux boxes because the gears aren't all that strong and
will shatter with all the torque that a type 4 engine has.  Any truth to
that?
