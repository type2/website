Subject: 71 engine into a 65 Not!!!

Well ran into a job ending snag and really don't know what to do to solve it.

I have the doghouse cooler setup on the 71 engine. So I had to use the 71's
fan housing.  When Iwent to bolt it on the puley for the generator doesn't
line up.  I found out a while back that I have a bug generator with a bug
backing plate.

Haven't been able to locate a dished plate to use the correct gen.  I thought
I might be able to use the backing plate I had on the 71 with the 6V gen but
the holes don't line up.  :(

Any suggestions?

Hoping for the best,
Snoopy
