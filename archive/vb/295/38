Subject: Re: Re: [VB] Convert late bay tranny to swingaxle?>Rand 7:1

"Michael Evans" <MEVANS(-at-)xxxxxxxx> mentioned that the Rand (SA currency) trades
at seven to one US dollar. Does this mean that if I wasnt p*ss poor broke that
potentially I could import one of those infamous transcontinental Dormobile
splittie buses to the US and feel like I got a good deal?

Darned tempting to really work for a living and nab one.

Isnt taking a later tranny back to swing axle kinda like leaving Pam Anderson
and going back to that bad skank date that you had on a short shore leave in
Bangkok?
Just when we've seen all of the possible bus trends we now are going see all of
the kewl kids undoing all of the BusBoy lowering kits and raising the
boxonwheells back up to Baja height with the Jamax white wheels with mudders.

Ah, what do I know? It's been so long that I've almost forgotten the feeling of
driving a splittie or Pam Anderson. <sigh> ;-o
