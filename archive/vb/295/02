Subject: [VB] Finally found my bumper sticker

Since the holiday season is now upon us (or has been since Halloween, it 
seems), the following bumper sticker sentiment might be the **perfect** 
holiday gift (or stocking stuffer) for your favorite in-your-face bus

Or if he's too nice a guy to have a bad attitude, you can opt for the 
more traditional sentiment:

Lots of funny stickers at this place.
