Hi Ventwing,
Best guess we have is a fuel problem.  Sounds like the time we had one of the 
two springs inside the fuel pump fail so in higher RPMs the fuel pressure 
dropped off.  If you are running a bus not a SC and the fuel tank is well above 
half full you can run a flex fuel line to the carb bypassing the pump and use 
gravity to give the engine enough fuel.  Just make sure to plug the inlet and 
outlet of the fuel pump with a loop of flex fuel line to prevent any fuel 
residue from inside it from starting a fire.
