Wow, either you guys got lucky or I had the MFH (manifold from hell)!  I
had to drill a hole at each end (just above the turn) and then was able
to have a straight shot with a suitable reaming implement.  I finally
got it open.  I've heard of people heating it up with a cutting torch
and then blasting O2 in there to burn it out...obviously this is not an
in bus operation.
