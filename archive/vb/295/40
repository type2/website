Subject: Re: [VB] Re: fleetlines / 10 digit serial number/ pic

A guy that visits my site has a fleetline. Its a 75 according to "the system" of his DMV, and a post
made earlier i think by clara, agrees with this vin being a 75 as well. It is a widebed singlecab.
Heres a pic of his wacky mplate

Im assuming EA is his delivery port code. Will have to add it to my list although im not sure what
port in SA that is refering to. any idea Christian? can anyone decode that plate?
