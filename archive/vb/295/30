Hey All--

Hope all of you survived the feeding trough yesterday--I know I overdid
it--I love Thanksgiving--*>)

Anyway--I am in the process of purchasing a bigger capacity plazma
cutter and am offering my current one, to anyone that would like to be
be able to cut any steel up to a half inch thick--with a wave of your
hand.

It's only 3 years old and works perfect--I just want to be able to slice
up to 1.5" plate in a single pass--so I ordered a bigger amp unit last
Tuesday--

This unit would be perfect for any of you who are into fabrication, or
body work--it makes for slicing sheet metal a breeze --and with no or
very little slag, or distortion---

Might even be interested in some sort of trade--

Drop me a line if your interested---

Happy Recovery Day---:>)


Later,
