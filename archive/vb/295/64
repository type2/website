Subject: re:  Blocked heat riser tube...

Hello all,

While I have not done this personally yet (I will), a friend did this to a
clogged manifold that I bought from him about a year back.  The manifold was
off the motor.  He turned the manifold upside down (ends of the pre-heat tubes
pointing upward), clamped it in a vice, and then poured Castrol "Super Clean"
de-greaser concentrate (kind of a purple-ish color) "full-strength" into each
end until the pipe was full at each end.  He left it that way for about 24
hours, then poured out the degreaser.  He then ran the clutch cable into each
end and cleared out a bunch of "softened up" carbon and other shit until it
got tough to get any more out.  He then repeated the process again (fill, soak
overnight, empty, and clean out).  He said it works great at
softening/loosening up the carbon and eventually cleaning out the pre-heater
tube.  The manifold tube was cleared, then bead blasted, painted and installed
on my '59 Double-Door Panel, and now warms the intake tube nicely.  Worked for
us, you might want to give it a try!

Happy Holidays!
