Your right on the money here Karl--after who can count the years of
using a incadescent drop cord--and never having anything quite like this
happening--It just crossed my mind--in a flash to request a flourescent
drop cord lamp from Happy Snappy when he shows up Wednesday--

Let me elaborate on this one again--it was quite the the heart throbbing
happening--

I've had tri power go poof and start a gas fire--I've welded panels on
Semis and had under dash fires--but nothing quite this exciting, and awe
inspiriing--:>)

Scary story, glad to hear it didn't have a terrible ending. In my 22
years in business, early on I learned the lesson that those open-bulb
type drop lights are unsafe for use around a car. I highly recommend one
of the nice sealed florescent lights, more expensive but well worth it.
