Subject: help--bus won't go!

Drove out to mom's house for thanksgiving--made it
almost all the way there. The bus starts a little
hard, but starts...idles, I can even rev it all the
way up to 3k, and the timing advances properly, but as
soon as i put a load on the engine (come up off the
clutch) the engine sputters out. I have revs, but no
power. any ideas? thanks guys, and i hope you're
having a nice holiday!

Oh, BTW- '61 bus with a 1600 DP, solex 30/31 (no
aircleaner) someone suggested i sucked some crap into
the carb?
