Subject: 67 Middle Seat

Hiya Gang,
Got a question.  There's this 67 Deluxe that I'm considering . . .the middle
full length seat folds over the way it should and everything, but it has a
latch that you lift up on to fold it over, like the latches that VW put on
the 67 Sedan seats.  It's to keep the seat from going forward during a
sudden stop.  Also, there are no hand rails on top of the middle seat
sections, but on the back, on each side.  They are black, and look like they
belong there.  I am pretty sure that the 67 middle seat is a one-year-only
seat, but does this sound like the right seat for this year?  Forgot to
mention that both the middle and back seats are upholstered with
basket-weave ,(ala 64-67 bugs) upholstery.

Also, this bus has been re-painted, supposedly original colors.  The velvet
green looks correct, but above the beltline is a bright white.  I thought
that above the beltline should be L-87, pearl white?

I'm grateful for any help/advice on this.
