That is a very typical Fleetline VIN plate. I hesitate to
call it an M-code plate, as the Fleetlines came as they were
served -- the only choices were body style and colour. I
have been unable to decode most of the Fleetline VIN plate
codes. The EA I think is consistent across all of them, and
may be a port code. VWAG used SF as port code for South
Africa, but the EA may be the Brazilian code for SA, as the
port nearest Uitenhage is Port Elizabeth, so E could be for
Elizabeth, and A for Africa???

Clara is correct that the top left number (264B in this
case) is the model number, with the B signifiying (I think)
Brazil. I have noticed that all Brazilian-made parts have a
large B, usually near the VW logo or the part number.

Nearly everything that I have written about Fleetlines is
pure speculation and educated guesswork on my part, and may
be subject to correction. So far, I have yet to find anyone
who KNOWS.
