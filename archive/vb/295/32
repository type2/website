Subject: 71 engine into 65

I am in the process of installing the engine from my 71 SC into my 65 deluxe.
I already asked the list a while back which parts I need from the 65 6 Volt
engine to swap and have that part ready.  But I was wonderig what to do about
the engine hanger???  Should I leave it on (the engine will eventually be
going back in my 71) or just let it hang?  Will it even fit in the splitty
engine compartment?

As soon as I can break loose the flywheel nut I can go about putting it all
back together and installing so I can drive my bus again.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
