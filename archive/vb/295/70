Subject: Re: [VB] Redux Boxes?

Yes,
	The redux boxes are extremely stout if all of the bearings in them 
are fine.  They will deal with most any motor.  People change out the 
reduction gear boxes when they want to change the final gearing on their 
bus and when lowering.  I like redux boxes!  Gary Gibson
