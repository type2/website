  I have found that all 59 to 67 bumpers use the same components. You may
have a WW repo bumper and/or parts in which case it will take some work to
make them fit. Another problem could be a bent/tweeked over ride, towel bar
and/or bumper.

How do the overiders and uprights fit on those
bumpers? Do you have to put that black "stuff" on them
to cover up big gaps?
