Tom,
I guess I should have used the spell check option before I sent that.
I don't mind laughing at myself once in awhile though.
For a short time, I had a security guard job at a Borg-Warner Plant, and
they had a wall in their cafeteria listing all the corporations that they
make parts for and the awards they had received.
Featured prominently on the wall was "VOLKSWAGON"
