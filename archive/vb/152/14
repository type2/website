Subject: RE: [VB] New Seat Covers

I got mine from Ronnie at oldvolks.com
I actually just finished getting the old wire through the new seat covers.
Surprisingly not as hard as I thought(although I did get one tiny puncture
wound, trying to get the thin wire to turn the corner)

The original cover for the drivers side bottom had a odd connection-instead
of the dagger like metal prongs sticking out, it had another short piece of
wire that went through a hole in the frame, then through the upholstery,
then through another hole in the frame. This must be where Ronnie
recommended hand sewing part of the drivers side bottom seat covers.

Kevin,

Who did you order them from? I need new upholstery for my bug and I'm not
having much luck finding a
reliable supplier.

Well I have finally gotten around to ordering new seat covers....and now i
am trying to install them. I got some pointers from Ronnie (-at-) oldvolks. but
one quick question to the list-how do you guys clean the frames? I was
thinking of taking them down to the self car wash, so I could basically
pressure wash them. Would this cause some premature rusting-right now there
is basically no rust on these(a little bit where the metal spikes that grab
the covers)
