Subject: FW: [VB] Re: Slash rear bumper

Hello Sean	
	
I believe there are two types of overriders early pre 65 for the slash
bumpers and late for the pointed bumpers. I will check when I get home
but someone on the list will tell us here shortly.

67 Deluxe 13 "Brutus"

How do the overiders and uprights fit on those
bumpers? Do you have to put that black "stuff" on them
to cover up big gaps?
