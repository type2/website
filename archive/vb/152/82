Subject: Funny Ads

    I admit being addicted to Everett Barnes' great website "thesamba.com"
and although I've never bought any of the cars advertised, I'm sure someday
I will. Once in awhile, the grammer and the errors make me laugh, for
instance " 65' Westfalia" (I picture a camper sixty-five feet long), and I
wish people would remember that the abbreviation for "etcetera" is "etc."
not "ect.". But, it's the actual grammatical statements that send me
howling, for example "all original, completely restored" appears quite
frequently.
Today's favorite is a Karmann Ghia which according to the advertiser "This
car only needs an engine and will run perfectly."

Am I the only one that notices these things?
John Flowers :-)
