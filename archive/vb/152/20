Hi Bryan,
Best guess is that it was another try of USA auto manufactures trying to pass 
US laws to help keep out VWs and other imports.  Some of these laws passed 
and others never quite made it.
Here is a small list of things VW had to change due to import laws.
1. Pennsilvania only tail lights for 1959ish-61 bug.
2. Higher head lights in KG starting in early 1961.
3.  1956-61 bug tail lights having plastic dimming lense to prevent too 
bright of tail lights.  This was not used in EURO bugs.
4.  Sealed beam head lights.
