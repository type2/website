I wish it were true.  I couldn't find any reference to a straight-weight 
synthetic on Mobil's web site, so I called them up and asked.  The person I 
talked to said he knew nothing about a straight 30-weight oil.  Here are 
the only weights listed on www.mobil1.com:

0W-40
0W-30
5W-30
10W-30
15W-50

He did say they were working on a 5W-20 oil.
