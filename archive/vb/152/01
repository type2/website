Subject: RE: [VB] H4s ~WARNING~ BIG DANGER!!!!

***WARNING***

I strongly, emphatically, suggest running fuses AND a relay to each light
housing. Case in point I ran the Indian H4's on the from Phoenix to Seattle for
the Summer Vintage meet and SIR show in 1998. 

Barely inside Oregon we stopped for gas after running headlights during the day
for supposed extra safety consideration. Got out to wash the wind shields Paula
noticed smoke emitting from the headlights and warned me. Massive scramble back
to the battery and clawing at the interior fuse panel prevented a total burning
of the 67camper!!!! No Bueno!

Additional crappy human factors engineering by VW results in brown (ground)
wire going to the silver electrical lead on the headlight buckets and grey wire
(positive) going to a copper connection. A road weary traveler and supposed vw
guru self-absorbed resto driver running on pure adrenaline is proned to connect
brown to copper and grey to silver thereby cross-posting the connections and
creating an open ground. DUH! Major danger Will Robinson.

Remember: Brown is ground the world around and a grey day may be positive...

We ended staying the night rebuilding the entire wire harness from the
headlights to the switches due to smoking all insulation off of the OG harness.
We were REAL lucky that the whole bus didn't go up in flames. Thanks to that
nameless gas station attendant who's dad was an electrician and had tons of
wire from which to build the harness...

I am dead serious in running relays and in-line fusible links prior to the dash
fuse panel. Over kill is better than toasted buses. I personally will run OG
closed beams and if I get a "heart on" to run more lights will use addition
driving lights with the above suggested set-up.

If you purchase H4's choose a high quality unit sold by Ronnie at Old Volks
Home or other reputable vendors.
Good luck and be careful,
-Ellis\
