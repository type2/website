Hi Rich,
We dealt with the repro slash rear bumper about six years ago.  Definitely 
nicely done press wise, but thinner sheet metal and all welds in the bumper 
and uprights were a spot of weld bead here and there instead of the solid 
lines of weld the original ones had.  If we could not find an original to 
have straightened out then we would get a repro and reweld all the joints!!!
