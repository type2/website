Subject: RE: [VB] busted igntion switch?

Hi Michael,
in an emergency I have repaired these things by silver soldering. It is a
higher temp solder than radio solder but it also has a higher tensile
strength. The piece that broke off of mine was too short to do anything with
so I went to the local FLAPS and bought a little packet of terminals. You
can also steal one of the bent ones off of a coil out of the wrecking yard.
Clean up both areas with OO steel wool and solder a blob on the switch
housing broken off tab around the rivet, (the rivet won't solder if it is
the aluminum one, it will if it is the brass one). Pre-tin the new tab only
in the area not mating with the push on terminal, and then holding it with a
pair of needle nose pliers or some long nose tweezers, solder it onto the
broken off area and let it cool normally without moving so as to not
crystallize the solder joint and make it weak. I have used that method in a
pinch, but on my 71 westfailure it was that way up until the time I sold it.

hi all-

in my flurry to clean up an ignition switch out of a 65 bus (snap of style
terminals) i accidentally bent one of the copper (?) terminals on the back
of the switch and it broke off. is there any way to repair this? the
terminal appears to be rivetted to the ignition switch , so dunno if there
is anyway to make a workable solution. the switch itself appears to be a
sealed unit which does not lend itself to being taken apart.

help! :)
