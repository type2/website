The ground.  Go down to the hardware store and get a 6' copper ground
rod.  Pound it into the ground behind your Bus, then run a minimum 6
gauge wire from each tail light to the ground rod.  Note: use long wires
if you want to go very far in your Bus.

Seriously...I grounded both of mine to the bolt where the battery negative
strap attaches to the chassis.  For the right tail-light this is easy; for
the left one, run the ground wire along the existing harness - over the
engine compartment opening and back down the left side.  Put the battery
strap closest to the chassis and the other wires (with ring terminals)
on top of it.

If you really want to do it up, Rat Shock sells (used to sell?) a little
"power tap" connector that was meant to give you more push-ons at the
battery.  It's just a stamped piece of metal with a slot for a big bolt
and three push-ons along the edge.  Slide it under the battery strap
bolt and you have three ground connections. 

While it is true that early models didn't have these grounds, VW did
add them sometime around 1969.  They definitely improve the grounding
and brightness of your lights.
