Subject: H-4's...

I have run H-4's for years. I have never tried the cheapy new style. You
can usually pick up H-4's for $5-$10 a piece by watching swaps and since
the bulbs are replaceable you only need to visually check the housing
for cracks. My secret is to run the 90/130 bulbs but drop your lights
down about 1/4" when aiming them. I have never been brighted by oncoming
traffic and have traveled in numerous caravans with no complaints. If
you go with the 90/130 bulbs stick with quality Hella or Bosch bulbs as
the cheap imitations tend to burn out much faster. The 80/100 bulbs seem
to have a longer life regardless of brand so I started running those
instead. I have not added any relays or fuses and have had no problems.
I would however recommend adding them for the safety benefit and getting
a little more power to the light can never hurt. The advantage to the
quality H-4's is exactly what someone mentioned before, they have a
super sharp and clean cutoff. This means you can put a ton of light
where you need it without a bunch of excess light bleeding over into
oncoming drivers eyes. A lot of that new cheap Xenon/Blue light stuff
causes so much glare that it makes it hard for anyone to see.
hope this helps,
