A straight weight synthetic had actually been on wish lists for a 
while.  About two years ago there was a discussion at one of the 
meetings i attended on new merchandise for the flaps iworked at that 
time.  The vendor rep from mobile stated that strange as seemed that 
there actually were some difficulties in blending a straight weight in 
synthetics.  Looks like the hurdle has been beaten.
Love it.. i definately have a use for the stuff as soon as it hits the 
street here.
