Subject: Syn oil again

   As I have stated I have switched to Mobil 1 15-50 full syn oil. I just
checked my oil after over 2500 miles of driving and didn't use a drop! I
would usually use 1/2 guart of dyno in the same distance.
  I just came from Wally World where I was getting some lights for my new
trailer http://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/42250.jpg and saw that Mobil
now makes a straight 30 weight full syn oil now, all the air cooled people
must have gave them an earfull, so they decided to make it.
