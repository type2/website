Subject: Re: [VB] Funny Ads

there were more funny ads in the past and I'm sure that if you start checking right now I bet you
can find errors and misspelled words in almost every ad.... I know since I have been in the market
for a little while. Stuff about "rust in usual places", "95% original" or "Volkswagon" don't really
make me laugh anymore.... eBay scares me though.... people would list a Bug in the Bus section with
title " 1967 VW Bus Bug for sale" - what? not really sure what it is? - or a 1972 Ford Camper Van
with title "1972 Volkswagen Van" as we've seen noted here just yesterday. Why wouldn't people use
spell check? Usually when I write descriptions I use Word and then just copy and paste text.... to
avoid laughs..... but that's just me.... some people don't care.

peace,

I like the people who say "usual Bus rust".  Uh, I'm used to no rust, so
it's perfect, right?
