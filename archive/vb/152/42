Subject: Re: [VB] Tips on removing petrified window seals?

Soak the frames in molten lava for 30 minutes.  The rubber will
come out like butter.

Failing that, take a sharp utility knife and cut at angles
down the channel, ie 'reaching into' the channel  This will reduce the rubber
to little strips which can be pulled out easier.
