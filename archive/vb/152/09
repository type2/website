Subject: New Seat Covers

Well I have finally gotten around to ordering new seat covers....and now i
am trying to install them. I got some pointers from Ronnie (-at-) oldvolks. but
one quick question to the list-how do you guys clean the frames? I was
thinking of taking them down to the self car wash, so I could basically
pressure wash them. Would this cause some premature rusting-right now there
is basically no rust on these(a little bit where the metal spikes that grab
the covers)

The reason I want to clean them(I know they will basically never be seen)
but they are kind of sticky, and greasy-I guess 37 years does that to you.

Any other suggestions welcome.

I am trying to reuse the metal wire from the old covers, and then the
existing spikes-as they are still fairly solid. I am not planning on
painting them-as there isn't really any rust on them, and the original paint
looks pretty good.

thanks
