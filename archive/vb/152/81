Hi Bart,
It should if it is a post-1963 model.

New rubber will have to seat/squish in.  So try pulling it over when closing 
and see if it stops needing to be pulled over in six months to a year.  If 
not, adjust the door.

If you are trying to preserve the original paint then wax it.  Use only a wax 
with Carnuba in it.  Ones that use Silicon in them make a real mess when you 
want to repaint it!
