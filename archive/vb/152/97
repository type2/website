Subject: busted igntion switch?

hi all-

in my flurry to clean up an ignition switch out of a 65 bus (snap of style
terminals) i accidentally bent one of the copper (?) terminals on the back
of the switch and it broke off. is there any way to repair this? the
terminal appears to be rivetted to the ignition switch , so dunno if there
is anyway to make a workable solution. the switch itself appears to be a
sealed unit which does not lend itself to being taken apart.

help! :)
