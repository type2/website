How long did it take for him to give you a price and to order them for you?

I got mine from Ronnie at oldvolks.com
I actually just finished getting the old wire through the new seat covers.
Surprisingly not as hard as I thought(although I did get one tiny puncture
wound, trying to get the thin wire to turn the corner)
