  I will have a fair set of single cab gates with me at Familianfest/Pomona
this weekend if anyone is looking for something to get them buy till they
can find a cherry set. These are pretty straight (passable) and do need some
rust repair in a couple of the lower hinges. Use as is or spend a little
time and cherry them out. Both sides and rear gate . Also have 2 treasure
chest doors there also. Both look great from the outside but 1 has had some
work done on the inside.
