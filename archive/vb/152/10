Hi Sean,
If the light switch gets hot then you need to disassemble, clean and solder 
all the riveted connections inside.  Also check you fuse box for hot running 
fuses.  If any of the fuses are hot, not just warm, you need to solder all 
the brass clips in it together.  Failure to do either can result in singed or 
burnt wiring or at best reduced voltage getting to all parts of the VW wiring 
system!  Resulting in slower signals, wipers, and all lights being dimmer.  
We have been using the Indian made H-4s with 55/60 bulbs for several years 
and have never been flipped off during that time for having them on.  Aiming 
them properly seems to be the ansewer to prevent that.
