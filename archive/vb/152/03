the thing skid plate is pretty cool,
 It is a 3-piece set up. You have 2 parts that bolt to the long bolts at the
front and rear of the oil sump. It had "bars"that run the length of the sump
and curves around the sump plate so that it can be removed. The third piece
bolts to the 3 hole that a late bus or type 3 uses to mount the hanger bars.
this piece comes down and covers the gap between the lower cylinder tin and
the muffler. The only thing it really does is keep things from hitting the
cooling tin, fins  or catching the sump plate.
