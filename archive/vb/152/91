Hey all...just another reminder that SOUTHERN California's BEST Vintage VW 
show is tomorrow (fyi-North of Oceanside is Central California, North of 
L.A. is Northern California and anything North of San Fran is just Oregon! 
:) ). 

Get there early to get a spot to swap, show or just kick back and have fun. 
General Admission is $7. More info is at http://www.sv2s.com/ . 

See you all there I hope!
