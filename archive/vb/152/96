Greetings from Indonesia,

I saw a RHD panel van with the following VIN:
16 3
106 196
JD 2141 111180 1267208

Would this be translated to:
M date March 16, 64
Heavy-duty shocks, asymmetrical light
JD (help!) -  RHD Cargo, came in primer -Ruby Red on ruby red with grey
upholstery

Regarding the finishing, which area was in primer? interior? engine
compartment?

Have a nice week end....

Kemal
