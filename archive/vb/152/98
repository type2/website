Remove the tumbler by removing the clip on the center pin.
Buy a new ignition switch from any vendor of your choice.
Remove the tumbler and toss it.
Stick in your old tumbler.
Toss the old broken switch.
Only difference will be the position of the key. It will be turned about 20
degrees farther then the old switch. But you have a brand new switch....
