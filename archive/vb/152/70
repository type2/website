Subject: Oil cooler hose size reduction

I am installing an oil cooler, per Ron VanNess article, in order to drop
my hwy operating temps by 20 degrees. The problem is that the hose to my
oil filter is 1/2" and the largest fitting to the oil cooler is 3/8".I
have the adapter to reduce the hose diameter but I am wondering what
this reduction in size will have on my lubrication system. I am not an
engineer and know nothing about hydraulics so I will defer to the wisdom
of the list. As always, TIA TBear     



Don't take life to seriously--you'll never live through it.
