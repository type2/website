Subject: Re: [VB] Firewall between tank and engine on a split?

Hi,

enclosing the tank with the overflowed fuel could be the makings of a bomb. 
Imagine a couple of ounces of fuel overflowed into that enclosed area 
evaporating into a nice 14:1 air/fuel ratio. This does not happen in the 
tank itself because all that fuel evaporates to saturation which is not so 
likely to ignite. I would leave that firewall alone.

Cheers!!
Chris
