Hey, you are entirely too awesome Jim! Thanks SOOOO much for hooking me up
with that. I know the other alt is better, but at the moment it's a case of
using available resources and time.

Your link is working again too.

Thanks again,

John

Normally I would direct John and other list members to a link on my website
dealing with this problem, but apparently my ISP (C-Zone.net) are having
technical difficulties (they're workin' on it).....

Link when it's back up is:  http://www.oldvolkshome.com/7374altvr.pdf In the
meantime, I have sent a copy of the PDF to John via pmail.  If any others
would like a copy of this PDF by pmail, I will be happy to provide it.
