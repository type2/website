Aha! There is a small rectangular Motorola box that  came with the  engine.
It has a  small connector with  4  spades in it. Any  way  to  identify
these  connections?

hey john  You would be better off swapping the alternators .   The 3 wire
unit requires a voltage regulator  .  the single wire unit  was the later
style and has a built in regulator.  You can rewire the tree  terminals to a
voltage reg.  later  mark  dearing
