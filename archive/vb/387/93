Subject: Re: [VB] Firewall between tank and engine on a split?

Well, it seems the majority of people are going with the 'no firewall' 
solution.  As I am not one to screw with the natural order of things, I will 
also go that route... although, I don't appear to have a drain/overflow on 
my '63 panel, so I will look into finding a solution to that.

Thanks for all the opinions.
