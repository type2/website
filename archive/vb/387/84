Several potential solutions that I've seen work
when filling older cars in Oregon. The Type 3
Invasion last weekend was in Oregon, and I
saw these tactics successfully used.

- Ask the fillers to not top it up. Be a touch strong
with this request, they are very eager to top it up.

- Ask to fill it yourself due to it being a classic car
and it needs to be filled differently than newer cars.

- If you have a really nice paint job, request that you
do it yourself, to reduce the risk of them accidentally
damaging the paint.

If none of these are accepted by the fillers, stand next
to them during the fill up, which makes them nervous
and more likely to hand it over to you. If you have a
tank inlet geometry that requires someone to actually
hold the nozzle during the fill, they are more inclined to
hand it over to you, so they can go on to another vehicle.

If you can find a station that does any of these to your
satisfaction, let them know, and use that station more
so they get to know you and your vehicle.
