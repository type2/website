I had a similar problem.  An adapter you need. Assuming you are not in a 
Metric Zone. Buy a piece of 5/16 square key stock at your hardware store. 
Most likely in the specialty bins.  You may want to cut a 1/8 or 1/4 inch 
off of your existing shank (you will need to decide if this is necessary or 
not). If need be, drill the hole a little deeper, with a 5/32" drill, and 
rethread using either an M5 or a 10-32 tap. The two are so close that they 
are virtually interchangeable for this purpose. Cut off the desired length 
of key stock and drill a clearance hole, 7/32", thru the center. Best done 
on a drill press or at a machine shop. Use a slightly longer screw, again 
either M5 or 10-32, and assemble your handles. The adapter will slight into 
the square hole and into the inside handle.

I did this once with a piece of brass without cutting my old handle.

Subject: [VB] Side Door Lock Mechanism

 I have another question. I'm driving a 1963 Panel Bus. The side doors ONLY 
lock from the outside. No handle on the inside, or lock.

 I bought an original locking mechanism with inside/outside handles & inside 
lock tab from a Deluxe Bus on TheSamba.com, and received it this week. I was 
hoping to use my original handle on the outside, since it's in WAY better 
shape than the one I just got in the mail (and keyed correctly). Is there 
any way to do that?

 The square insert on the Deluxe handle is longer than my original.

 What's the best way to tackle this?
