Subject: SO-42 pop top springs

I've searched with no luck to find information on the tensioning springs for the pop top mechanism on my '66.  Any measurements of, or leads as to who might sell them would be appreciated ~ mine have been missing for many years and I'm getting tired of the old "vice grip" fix.
