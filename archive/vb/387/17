Subject: Side Door Lock Mechanism

Thanks everyone for the replies to "Generator Woes." I finally got to changing the brushes out on the (6v) generator, and that did the trick! :-) I really appreciate everyone's replies with suggestions and ideas.

I have another question. I'm driving a 1963 Panel Bus. The side doors ONLY lock from the outside. No handle on the inside, or lock.

I bought an original locking mechanism with inside/outside handles & inside lock tab from a Deluxe Bus on TheSamba.com, and received it this week. I was hoping to use my original handle on the outside, since it's in WAY better shape than the one I just got in the mail (and keyed correctly). Is there any way to do that?

The square insert on the Deluxe handle is longer than my original. 

What's the best way to tackle this? 

Is there any way to get the longer square insert OUT of the Deluxe, and into my original outside handle, or do I have to have the outside handle that's all pitted and peeling rekeyed to match my original?

Thanks,
Kenn
