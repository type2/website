Hello,
   
  Until I found your website, I was absolutely directionless in my search for a VW bus - 1971-ish, white, or eggshell colored......
   
  This is my story:
   
  I am getting married in about a month to a guy who LOOOOVES VW buses.  He actually has one that needs a lot of work.  I REALLY wanted to surprise him on our wedding day by renting/borrowing a white or ivory-colored bus to use as our "getaway car" after the reception - to drive no more than 10 miles to the hotel, and then to pay the owner of the bus for letting us use it... 
   
  The wedding is in San Diego.  Do you know of anyone I could ask in the Southern CA area about renting or borrowing a white VW bus??
   
  I really hope to hear from you!
  Thanks,
Christine
