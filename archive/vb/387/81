Subject: Firewall between tank and engine on a split?

Volk-A-Maniacs,

So, my sister-in-law bought a '70 bus (I might forgive her someday).  I was
checking it out and noticed the firewall between the gas tank and the
engine... then started pondering how that might work in my '63 panel/camper.

Any thoughts on how adding such a thing might screw up the airflow/cooling?
Has anyone done this before for safety reasons?  Or other reasons?
Is it a stupid idea?

The reason I am concerned is first; because the source of all vehicle fuel is
a few inches away from the source of all spark.  Second; because here in
Oregon, some of our gas attendants are not classically trained in the fueling
of older vehicles.  They occasionally forget to actually tighten the gas cap
when finished fueling my bus.  On those 'special' occasions when they
overfill, then do not cap it properly, it can result in a small pool of gas.
Which concerns be greatly because I can literally see the engine from where
that pool resides.  If there were some kind of firewall there, it might at
least make me feel better.

Thoughts?  Opinions?  Flames (pun)?
