Subject: VW bus inspired Chopper Bike for trade

Hey Y'all,
Bus lists, I apologize in advance for marginal content
(but there is definitely mandatory bus content). 
Anyway, I am looking to trade this VW bus\bug inspired
custom built chopper bicycle for a running 1500 or
1600 engine OR split bus camper interior.
It is cool and it is in Ohio, check out the photo ad
here:
