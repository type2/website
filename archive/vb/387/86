Hi Tristan,
Our 1960 panel camper conversion has the same, but it empties on the  inner 
about 2/3s to the rear of the wheel well.  Our 1963 SCs do not  have any catch 
or drain.  So because of this the gas tank floor  gets water and fuel on them, 
which causes rusting out.  Plotting  on welding in the drain system to avoid 
that in the future.
  The only two advantages to having a firewall is possibly to help cut  down 
on interior noise, and to keep engine gasses from brittlizing the  rubber tank 
neck if you use the post-1967 gas  tank.
