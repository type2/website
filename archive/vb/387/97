Me = Duh.

I'm glad you asked me to do that... I opened up the fueling hatch and took 
some pictures.  I couldn't see any hole at all.  I then took a picture 
looking up at it from the engine compartment... hey, what is that tube 
there???  The problem was that in the filler area, it had so much crud 
(dust) in there that the tube was plugged and I couldn't even see it.  Hence 
my belief there was no tube.  Funny, I have always seen the tube in the 
engine but not ever really made the mental connection about what it was.

I'll try to clean that out before the next fueling adventure.  Thanks for 
the cattle prod toward the obvious.  :o)
