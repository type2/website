Hello there, I have some bad news, because of some scheduling conflicts with
the Grand Canyon National parks people,  I have been forced to change our
shoot date 

in Jerome to Monday August 7th.   I apologize for the inconvenience, and
will understand if you can't change your date.  

If we can't do this in August, I can try to hook up with you in mid-february
2007, that's when we'll be in Jerome again.

Again, I'm very sorry for the hassle this has caused you.
