Subject: fs; early engine block with serial number starting 20- 

I have an early engine block with the serial number 20-
there is pictures at http://www.globalserve.net/~jrivers/forsale/
I think it is a 36hp,, so that is what I called it.. but I really don't 
know.
it has the fuel pump and the dist reversed to a 1600.. and the generator 
mount is part of the block

If you want a 20- block,, I think you will know more than me about it.
Make me an offer...  If your interested ,, contact me !
