Hi UJ,

I was hoping that you might be able to help me.  I am one part away from
getting my bus back on the road and cannot find the part i need.  It is the
cupped washer that goes on the link pin in between the tortion arm and the
spindle.  Do you know of anywhere i can get one or could you put me on touch
with someone that could help me?

 

Thank you,

Morning Dove
