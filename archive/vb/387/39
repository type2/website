Hi,

I bead blasted my frames and then painted them with aluminum paint and a 
clear overcoat. They look great! Almost like an anodize finish. I then 
completed them with new glass from a local shop who sent the pieces out for 
tempering! I also found some of that fuzzy weather stripping that slid 
nicely into the extrusion slots. My windows are the louvered Jelousie 
variety. Not sure what you have.

Chris
