I would think you probably have a generator actually, and not an alternator.
If this assumption is correct, check out www.vintagebus.com There are some
wiring diagrams there-they should help you figure it out.

I am not sure about the tin or hoses....maybe the bentley manual should help
along with muir's idiot guide(those are what i use).
