  We ship doors quite often (when I have them). A bus door (without window
frames) cost 33.50 to ship from Arizona (Lake Havasu, bfe to Michigan)

ps. we wrap the complete door in bubble wrap and then cardboard, they go
double oversize and the weight is not a factor, as the door is lite

Does anyone out there have advice on shipping front doors?

I've recieved cargo doors from someone that shipped them UPS.  They taped
the hinges, removed the windows and hardware, put a shipping label on the
door, and sent them to me.  I received them without any problems.  The only
problem was the cost.  Because of the size, UPS charged about $50 a door.

Are there any alternatives?  I guess you would want to remove the window
frames.

Any ideas?
