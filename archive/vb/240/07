Hi Duck,
The pre-1960 rear shift linkage rod used on the forward end of the shift rod, 
211 711 203 Guide spring - Gearshift rod, rear.  It was made of metal and 
looked alot like a three legged stool with a hole through its top for the rod 
shaft to pass through and the legs were bent in toward the shift rod to 
create spring tension.  
  We are pretty sure the 211 711 203 is NLA from most places.  You could 
drill and chamfer a couple of holes in your rear shift linkage so you can use 
the post-1959 211 711 185 B Guide bush - Gearshift rod, rear, from Chassi No. 
835 088.

 Also, installed a new bushing and spring clip on the shifter bracket. The

Did you grease everything up?  Makes a big differance.  If it does not work 
properly after a while. You might use have to use 111 701 255 B Guide - 
Gearshift rod & 111 701 255 B Sleeve - Gearshift rod guide, both used up to 
Chassi No. 216 028 111.
