Subject: Speedo markings?

Having gotten David Ecclers' 'VW Transporter and Microbus Specification Guide 
195--1967' as a bel;ated valentines ay present, I have been perusing it at 
great detail.

BTW it is fantastic!

One thing really puzzles me.
On page 32 it states 
2.7.63  1 144 303 USA speedo now with gear change markings.
My 63 singlecab made in dec of 62 has gear shift markings.
Do I have the wromgh speedo or were a few mph marked speeedos introduced 
before July 63
