Subject: blinker troubleshooting

I'm going through the electrical in the 60 dc I just brought home that 
I had stashed in my brother's yard (we've called a truce here at my 
house:)  and here is my first electrical question.

None of the blinkers worked.  Replaced with generic three prong, 
tightened some connections, and now have all but driver's rear blinking 
correctly.  Regular lights work, brake lights work only on passenger 
side though.  Checked 5 terminal strip, and found that indeed the wire 
entering it from switch and exiting to driver's bulb has no current.  
All others work fine.  So now I assume my troubles are in the switch, 
correct?  If so, what can I do once I take the switch apart to try and 
remedy this, and what should I leave alone?  In a pinch, Can  I swap 
the switch over from the '65 that is working fine?

Thanks,
Don
