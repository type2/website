Subject: L360 OR 360-2

  Hi all, I'm getting ready for my next paint project using L360, sea blue BUT
I find there are two 'sea blue' mixing formulas.  Has anyone run across this
in the past?  One is "L360-sea blue" and the other is "L360-sea blue 2"(?)
Does anyone know where on the net I can fine BOTH color chips?
  Any help would be great, as PPG Concept is very expensive to be making a
mistake with!
    TIA,
      Lou in Havasu
