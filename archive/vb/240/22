Subject: Stock P&C's in a machined case?  And, is my hero on the list?

Here's another thought...

My case is machined for 90.5mm pistons and their appropriate cylinders. 
The crank is still 69mm creating the famed 1776cc.  As per my recent
posts, I have to get the current machined heads out of this car today,
but all I have are stock parts.  Is it possible to put in the stock sized
pistons and cylinders on the machined case?  Forgive me if this has been
put out before; I tried a couple of searches on the archive and looked at
probably 200 emails, to no avail.

Further, a couple of months ago I was assisted by a gentleman and his
wife in a early 60's Dove Blue Kombi in Olympia, WA.  I work in Oly, and
commute in my white-walled Guards red '59 Beetle.  You guys bought me
dinner and attempted to change my valve cover gasket, saving me crawling
around in my suit and tie.  Thanks SO MUCH for your help.  I made it home
fine, despite my ill-equiped parts box, which held only a 36hp valve
cover gasket set from my 59's last engine.  VW people rock!
