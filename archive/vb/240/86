Subject: Re: [VB] Shifting problems after lots of part replacing

It does feel really difficult to get it into 2nd and 4th, it just feels like
I am not pulling back in the right place, if I wiggle the stick around I can
get it into 4th easier than I can get 2nd.

Will have to try the vice grips tom evening - busy tonight - and it is gonna
bug me for the whole evening :-(

Don't think the engine is at an angle, I do remember it being a bit
difficult to fit the coupler though - it didn't just slide straight in I had
to wiggle it around a bit.

I shall have to mess about more with the plate I guess - it is a real pain
and I don't really want to drive it out of my garage as if I get stuck out
of gear there is no way for my to get it back in the garage as its entrance
has an incline.

Thanks
Paul
