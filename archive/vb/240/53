I have used both types.  I have actually found the glass filters stronger 
than the plastic ones.  I have had a lot of plastic filters start leaking at 
the case halves where they are glued together.  I have also found that 
through both heat and the gas runing through them, that after time the 
plastic of the body becomes brittle.   On dune buggies I use to have, I 
would only use the glass filters.  Never had a problem with them and they 
bounced around all over the place.

I guess it is just a personal preferece and what you are comfortable with.
Mike
