Hi Joe,
Did you make sure the TO bearing was being held side to side center in 
relation to the tranny input shaft?  Did you overtighten the clutch cable?  
When installing new clutch components we find that measuring with a ruler and 
a yard stick the pressure plate where the TO bearing rides against to the 
surface of the engine case that the tranny case seats to, and the TO bearing 
near the pivot point to the surface of the tranny bellhousing that the engine 
case seats to.  Between these two measurements the TO bearing to the tranny 
bellhousing must be 1/8" longer.
