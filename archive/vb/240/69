Pretty sure I have it right, on my 66 bus the shift rod is supported on a
pin at the front that goes into a bushing on the end of the coupling.  Then
inside the bus I have the shifter.   The shifter ball has a pin in it (I was
unable to peen down the edge to hold this in place though - which leads me
to believe it is worn).   The shift plate is fitted in the correct manner,
and then the shifter is fitted through that.  Pretty sure I have it all
right as I don't have any parts left over.

Thanks a lot
