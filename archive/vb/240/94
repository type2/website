Subject: Bus won't idle.

Ok, My bus starts after you give it a shot of gas, runs for a minute or so,
then dies.You can keep it alive by goosing the gas pedal, but that is a tricky
manuver going down a hill with a stop light at the bottom.  I forget where the
idle adjustment is on the type 1 1600DP (74 bug)  Is this the problem?  any
ideas?  Also, the "hot start" issue that plagues these older busses, does the
engine turn over but not catch? or is there no juice to turn the starter?
just curious.

Thanks-
