I  use clamps only on the pressurised side of the pump.   Not at the tank or 
especially where the line goes onto the metal line to the motor.  Only where 
it is under pressure.  I also only use the proper size german braided fuel 
hose.   it does not fall off.   though the slightly larger almost but not 
quite the right size American fuel line does if not clamped.

I once had the metal tube inlet of the carb pop out of the carb.  The engine 
died.  I pulled over, opened the lid, and found the problem, and wired it 
back together   It didn't catch on fire, luckily!!!!  I'm glad I didn't just 
keep turning the key :)

I agree with the grommet issue though.  definately.  and you can also use 
that old fuel line for a tube around the accelerator cable so it doesn't cut 
into the tranny.
