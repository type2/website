Subject: Shipping Front Doors ***

Does anyone out there have advice on shipping front doors?

I've recieved cargo doors from someone that shipped them UPS.  They taped the hinges, removed the windows and hardware, put a shipping label on the door, and sent them to me.  I received them without any problems.  The only problem was the cost.  Because of the size, UPS charged about $50 a door.

Are there any alternatives?  I guess you would want to remove the window frames.

Any ideas?
