Subject: Another shift rod question...

Hello, All... 
   I have the shift rod(front/rear pieces and coupler) out of my '58 bus.
Are there supposed to be some plastic spacers or bushings on the shaft
between it and the body holes that it passes through, or does the rod just
'swing' in free space? The rear shaft on the '65 has two funnel-looking
spacers, but the '58 rod does not have the holes to mount them. I have
looked but could not find a good pic of the early shift assemblies and
don't yet have the early Bentley manual. 
Also, installed a new bushing and spring clip on the shifter bracket. The
clip makes it almost impossible to move the rod. Can I leave the clip off
or not a good idea?
   I really wanna get all this back into the bus this weekend!   TIA
