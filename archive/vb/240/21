Subject: Re: [VB] Another shift rod question...

The earlier buses did not have a shift rod tube, and the rod just hung out.  
No tube, so no bushings between rod and tube.  when did they put in that 
tube?   

hmmm  I think at chassis # 306 726  (nov 57?)  so early in teh 58 model year.

my 58 parts list shows a dust cover cap for the end of the shift rod tube, 
the 56 edition did not yet have that.   but he 56 ed does show 1 (one) , not 
two, bushing for the rear shift rod.   hm, nothing in the old workshop 
manual.  never thought much about it.

yes you can leave the metal clip off the front shifting bushing.  earlu ones 
didn't have them.  but is that teh issue?  early buses had a dumb metal tang 
instead of a plastic shift bushing.   is part of you tang still there, 
interfering with the bushing?  and is the rod/ bushing well lubed?    are 
there crunchy rust spots that you might want to sand smooth there?

<< Hello, All... 
    I have the shift rod(front/rear pieces and coupler) out of my '58 bus.
 Are there supposed to be some plastic spacers or bushings on the shaft
 between it and the body holes that it passes through, or does the rod just
 'swing' in free space? The rear shaft on the '65 has two funnel-looking
 spacers, but the '58 rod does not have the holes to mount them. I have
 looked but could not find a good pic of the early shift assemblies and
 don't yet have the early Bentley manual. 
 Also, installed a new bushing and spring clip on the shifter bracket. The
 clip makes it almost impossible to move the rod. Can I leave the clip off
 or not a good idea?
    I really wanna get all this back into the bus this weekend!   TIA
