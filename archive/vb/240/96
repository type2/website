Didn't mention what type of carb you have on that, the original 34 PICT-3 or a
replacement 30/31 PICT ? Sounds like you have a vacuum leak. If you are
running a vac distributor I would check the vac line for suction off of the
carb by putting your finger over the end of the hose. If it sucks, then it
could be your vac can on the distributor. If it doesn't suck, you have a leaky
float bowl gasket or clogged vac line inlet tube. If you are running a .009
and your timing was set to 28 degrees at 3000 rpm and it is working OK, that
preety much narrows it down to the carb.

Ok, My bus starts after you give it a shot of gas, runs for a minute or so,
then dies.You can keep it alive by goosing the gas pedal, but that is a
tricky
manuver going down a hill with a stop light at the bottom.  I forget where
the
idle adjustment is on the type 1 1600DP (74 bug)  Is this the problem?  any
ideas?  Also, the "hot start" issue that plagues these older busses, does the
engine turn over but not catch? or is there no juice to turn the starter?
just curious.
