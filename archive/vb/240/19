Thanks Steve,
Based on your encouragement I'll cheerfully continue
on a regular basis to send mails to this list spelling
"tyres" the correct way and refer to distances in that
fearful measurement called metric :o)
Interestly, the fact that my 67 Panel has an MPH
speedo is one of the most appealing factors about it.
The 72 SC I used to own also had one in MPH & I was
very sad to see it disappear from my driveway,
especially since I never even got it roadworthy &
wasn't able to drive it.
Here in Oz we changed from pounds, shillings, pence &
miles to $$$, cents and kilometres in late 66 but the
washover of MPH stayed into the early '70s.
As such those cars that still have MPH speedos
represent a bygone era of motoring for enthusiasts.
We've definitely got rosy coloured glasses on but then
most people driving buses do.
I was only discussing changing the speedo in my '77
over to an old one in MPH the other day when I found
out I could be whacked with a defect notice as it
breaks post '75 design rules......missed it by that
much!
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
