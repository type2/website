I have used both types.  I have actually found the glass filters stronger
than the plastic ones.  I have had a lot of plastic filters start leaking at
the case halves where they are glued together.  I have also found that
through both heat and the gas runing through them, that after time the
plastic of the body becomes brittle.   On dune buggies I use to have, I
would only use the glass filters.  Never had a problem with them and they
bounced around all over the place.
I guess it is just a personal preferece and what you are comfortable with.

  With VW's everyone has their little preferences and probably no 2 people 
do it alike anyways.
The big (read expensive) and very good VW guy around here routinely builds 
show cars
($20k+) with plastic filters, no hose clamps and the filter hanging above 
the distributor. Not
my cup of tea but Ive never heard of one of his burning. I personally go to 
your favorite flaps
and get a metal filter with the right size ends for up by the tank and a 
little plastic one in the
compartment right before the pump. (yes 2). The metal one will last nearly 
forever but i change it
(and all fuel lines) every year. the little plastic one thats easy to get 
to, about every other oil change if it needs it but the big one usually 
catches all the stuff. I think i have the little plastic one mostly to
see if theres gas and maybe for roubleshooting? (habit). If youve had the 
plastic one degrade or leak,
its probably been on there too long id think.  My new bus has a sooty tank 
apparently and
ive been putting a little plastic one under the tank and changing it every 
few months but I think im
going to have to take it out and clean it sooner or later, the silt just 
isnt going away. To me every connection should have hose clamps, period. I 
have dual kadrons and pretty much always have dual carbs, those little 
plastic T's, forget em. Even at Pep Boys you can get an appropriate brass 
fuel T, im not sure whats it for but i got one and its worked fine ever 
since. Only other key is where the line goes through the rear tin, as others 
recomend slitting some old fuel line over the metal line is key and very 
good. I do that or just put a little piece of flex loom ( auto stereo stuff) 
over the line and push it through and zip tie it on both sides, this has 
worked for me too no problems. I had the famous brass inlet fall out of the 
carb once years ago and have heard theres ways to fix it, but to prevent it? 
Who knows..
