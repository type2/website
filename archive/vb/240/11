Subject: Can I put stock heads on 90.5 cylinders?

I'm sure the answer is just as simple, I just can't remember.  Probably a
rediculous, "Duh" question, but for the life of me...

My rocker arm broke on my gorgeous 35.5x40 dual ports.  The arm pounded
away the top of the valve.  I put on a new clip, it broke, hit it some
more. I'll have the valve head fixed, but I need my bus on Monday.  I
have a dual port sitting in the garage... the block is in bad shape, but
the stock DP's are perfect.  I'd like to sway, but the Bus I'm driving
has a 1776 in it.  What's the best course here?  Can I just swap heads?

Adam
