Subject: Rescue this bus

My friend Judy just returned from a trip to the west. She asked me to 
forward the message below interested parties.

While window shopping in Coeur d'Alene ID, i spotted a 66 or 67 panel bus in
a store. The store has gone out of business and is empty except for the bus.
Someone should check it out. No clue as to how to get it out, but it got in.
It's in Sherman Mall on Sherman Ave, just down from Crickets Oyster Bar and
Grill(with the Chevy on the roof).  Also, hi to the guy i saw driving a DC
over July 4th Pass on Wednesday May 7th.
