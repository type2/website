Subject: RE: [VB] Damage done by loose heads?

Barring any other problems with head stud threads in the case, I usually
retorque at 500 miles. It's a pain, but my engines always seem to last longer.
I have tore down customer engines and found the heads hammered with a groove
or the cylinderface on the block beat down. In both cases, the heads would
have to be fly cut and the case would have to be surfaced and then you would
be looking at shims to reset your deck height. That's all up to whether your
block of heads or both don't have cracks now!

Bearer of good news ?

After hearing the muir engine sounds, I'm looking at loose heads as the
culprit of the sounds I've been hearing.  I'll be investigating fully,
and torquing them tonight to spec if they're loose, but I'm just
curious as to what damage is caused by running the engine like this, as
the p.o. had this dc registered for the past year before I bought it.

-Thanks
