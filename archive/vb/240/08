Hi Volks,
Here in Washington State you can get a three year title if the auto has not 
been titled in this State for several years and thus the old records of 
ownership for it have been purged from the records system.  In otherwords if 
someone shows up in the three years once you get a three year title and can 
show they have proof of ownership they can get back thier auto, but once the 
three years passes the auto is your's.  
  We have done this a couple of time to save VWs that otherwise would have 
been crushed by others not as patient.
