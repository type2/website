Been thinking about this - I am pretty sure the new front bush is a blind hole,
whereas the old one was just an inner sleeve.  Could the shifting mechanism for
2nd and 4th on this different box need the shift rod to go further forward than
this new bush allows?  This bush was fine with the old box, but just wondering
if there is differences in the shifter between boxes.
