Years ago, I bought some bulb tint from JC Whitney.  It's probably still
around.  You could also try craft stores for similar products.

Another alternative is to replace the bulbs with high-intensity red LEDs.
You'd have to put a current-limiting resistor in-line, but the LEDs would
last just about forever!
