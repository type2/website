I also have a 66 & have lost one myself. It is held on by a "button"
thing IIRC about 25mm in dia. My other one rusted off as well. I plan
on trying to use something like liquid nails or some sort of really
strong adhesive to try & put it back in place. Haven't done so yet, so
I can't say if it works or now.
