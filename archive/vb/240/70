Hi paul 
 The pin can be changed for a bay one. Geuss how I know. The shift plate you 
can adjust backwards will make 1st and 3rd harder to engage forwards 2nd and 
4th.  Also make shure that all the parts are seated correctly, The front  the 
Make shure that rear gear change linkage is not hitting on the cross member 
and that the bush at the front still has a bit of travel left at the end of 
its rod. New gear linkages are available from VW Heritage its the same as a 
pre 64 Beetle if my memory serves me correct. Let me know how you get on. 
Mike
