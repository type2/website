I've used that one in the past.  It works...sometimes.
 The New Mexico MVD is getting pretty picky, ask
Hazetguy how long it took me to get him a surety bond
title when I tried to do it myself.  Check with your
local Taxation Department to see who inspects vins. 
They know how your state handles these things.
