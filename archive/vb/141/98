Rex,  In my experience, the solid red plastic thingy
sold as a replacemenrt for the rear shift coupler has
the same center to center distance on the grub screws
as the original front shift coupler, so just cut off
the front coupler and use the red plastic one!  I had
to cut one into six pieces before I was able to get it
off!  The rods themselves are hard to find, but if you
already cut one, send me a pmail.
