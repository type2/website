I had my bus painted a few years ago and by a couple of idiots (on a =
good day they are merely idiots, on a bad day they're crooks).  The =
price was really cheap and my bus has looked ok for the past few years =
so I should not complain much.  Anyway, rust is coming through on the =
rockers and dog legs and behind the front bumper.  So I'm planning to =
sandblast the lower 6 inches or so of my bus and they spray it with =
por-15 around the lower 6" or so. I'm also gonna so the same thing in =
the roof-gutter.  Then I'll prime fix etc.  I've never painted a car =
before so I'm lost.  I realize there is far from a consensus as to =
applying por-15 to the body - but I'm gonna do it anyway.  And if it =
doesn't look so hot then I'll use rock guard or something to hide it.  =
But I painted the underneath of my bus with por-15 about 4 or 5 years =
ago and it looks very good.

So anyway, I'm planning on spraying with por-15 then do I use =
epoxy-primer, then filler primer, and then paint.  I'll need a bit of =
putty or bondo on a couple of spots but very little ... when do I do =
that - between epoxy-primer and filler primer? - or between por-15 and =
epoxy-primer? My bus will never, ever be a show bus - it's a daily =
driver - but I'm still gonna do the guide coat thing and I also have to =
paint the interior - my dash is very bad. =20

Anyway, any advice is appreciated.
