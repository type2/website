Back in the early 70's I worked at a Lincoln-Mercury dealership. Ford came out
and said do NOT use grease any more on the pads on the backing plate. Install
the shoes dry unless a groove has been worn into the plate. Only then use
white grease. Ford determined that the grease retained the brake dust and it
became a grinding compound paste. This wore grooves into the plate faster than
no grease.
