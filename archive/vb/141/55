Subject: NEW Bentley 1950-1962, Jerome

   Here's your chance to be the first one on your block to OWN the NEW
Bentley 1950-1962 Workshop Manual.  These will be available to the public at
there debut at the JEROME JAMBOREE. Jerome was chosen by Bentley Publishing
to debut this book and I have been chosen to be the first to offer them. 
  The retail price on this book is $109.95 and I will be offering it at a
Jerome for 20% off and for all pre-sales (approx $88.00). This is a heavy
book, over 1000 pages covering every bus from 1950 to 1962.
  Bentley took all of the service manuals from these years, went through
them page by page, so there would be no duplication and came up with the
ULTIMATE bus manual for us pre 1963 bus owners.
  The manual just went to the printers and I have been assured that I will
receive the first copies to offer at Jerome.
  Any manuals pre sold for shipment WILL NOT be sent till after Jerome.
Those that preorder for Jerome pick-up will receive an extra little gift
from me.

Also, I will have copies of the new spec guide from England there also.
