Hi Susan,
Eberspacher was a German manufacture of gas heaters for ALL sorts of 
automobiles.  SouthWind was a USA manufacture of gas heater for ALL sorts of 
automobiles, including US military vehicles.  Probably the best you can do is 
to write down each model of gas heater he has, take a digital camera to 
photograph each and inquire if he has all the parts for each.  Plus we would 
see if one could inventory number each heater he has for this project.  
Research each model that he has and all the parts needed by contacting gas 
heater specialists  (One well advertised gas heater speacialist is a drunken 
thief unfortunitly!) and/or volks here on the list about each model for any 
or all the info you need.
