Subject: Re: [VB] pulley ratio - 356/912 pulley offset issues?

>Porsche pulley we found worked fine once we shimmed the pulley halfs just a

tad to the rear.  Since this pulley is a three piece item we just installed 
shims between the inner piece and the forward pulley half to realign it.
Are 
912 and 356 generator pulleys the same?   Eric&Barb<

Good idea on shimming the back of the pulley!  Exactly what I was thinking
would work.

From everything I can tell (w/o Porsche part numbers) the 356 and 912
pulleys are identical, which is logical since the motors were the same
(essentially, no nit picking please).  The only difference is in the
generators themselves in the 912 between an early low output one versus a
newer higher output unit, but the pulley still seems the same.

Lou (vwdragon(-at-)citlink.net) kindly sent some photos of the kit he got from
Bernie Bergmann (about $50 as he recalls).  I got quoted $58.50 for the
three pieces and matching fan belt (no shims).

Just got off the phone with Bernie Bergmann (himself).  He claims there is
no offset issue at all and it just bolts on.  Also he said that the Porsche
adjusting shims are the same as the VW ones... Not true from what I can
tell, the VW ones have a plain round hole in the middle and the Porsche
style should have a "D"/oval center thing going on to make them more stable
against the center pulley shaft...  Plus the Porsche shims are $1 each
whereas the VW ones probably around $1 for a hole pack, there better be a
difference.

Lets compare to Parts Obsolete:
912 Hub 		$20.20
912 Inner Pulley	$11.95
Belt 825mm 		$6     (not the correct size belt but here for
comparison purposes)
912 Outer Pulley	$8.75
Total:		$46.90

Either kit still needs the 9 Porsche shims from Parts Obsolete (or other
Porsche retailer), so add $9 to either figure.  Maybe a new woodruff key for
$.90 if you want to splurge :)

Hopefully this is semi helpful to someone out there :)

... I am thinking a "865-875mm x 10mm from continental" as previously
reported will work well as a belt...  Eric&Barb what are you all running as
a belt again?
