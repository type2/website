Subject: '59 Single Cab....rusted shiftrod

I'm in the process of prepping my '59 single cab for me to weld in a 
home-made front mount so I can use the later splitbus transaxle.

Learning from my old '59 Kombi, I decided to pull the shiftrod and 
make sure everything was good there. It turns out it's  stuck pretty 
good.

So I started out at the front shiftrod coupler. I tried to remove the 
2 set screws and both broke off at the heads. This is the metal 
coupler up kinda underneath the cab of the truck. I guess the best 
plan now is to drill out the broken set screws. But then, it's real 
possible the coupler will be welded to the shiftrod pieces by rust!!!

I'm wondering if any of these parts are available repro. The front 
shift rod. The front solid metal shiftrod coupler. The rear long 
shift rod section.

If they are available, or if I can find good used...it might make 
more sense for me to just cut these apart and get 'em out rather than 
messing around with them for days only to end up with something I 
can't use in the end.

Suggestions?
