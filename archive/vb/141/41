Subject: adding a second fuse block

I'm toying with the idea of putting in a second  fuse block in the 65 to
keep some of my accessories organized.  (radio, 40x2amp, cig lighter,
interior lights, etc.)  I did this in the 71, but the block is connected
to an Aux battery.  Can I run a second small fuse block off the main
block, and if so, where should I tap in?  Ideally, I would even like to
have the second fuse block switched between always on, and ignition on,
using a single pole, dbl throw switch.

1.  Is any of this possible and feasible?
2)  If so, any recommendations on amp ratings, wire ga sizes, inline
fuse locations, etc. would be much appreciated

Thanks
Don
