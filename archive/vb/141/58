Subject: Re: [VB] stereo that fits without any cuttting

I mounted a detachable-face CD player on the package tray right below the
radio and some surface-mount speakers on the underside the tray.  Then I
used a stock blockoff plate on the dash.  I manged to do all this and only
had to drill about 3 small holes in the tray, all easily fixed or replaced
with another tray.
