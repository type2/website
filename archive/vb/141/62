Subject: RE: [VB] 67 bus wheel cylinders

I have noticed the same thing as well.  Even with the wheel lug bolts which
I put anti-seize on.

Granted it has not been a problem at all.  I just would not expect it to gum
up over the years given what its purpose is.

... Probably bearing grease would be the best product to keep the adjusting
stars moving freely in the long run.

Take Care,

I've used this too...and found that (in my case) it seems to gum and
freeze up after a few months. Road and brake dust seem to be a hardener
for it.  I went back to grease. :)
