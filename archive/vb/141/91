grease is good grease is your friend your buses likes grease

I've been greasing adjusting stars and the holders they spin in for enough 
years that I've had to redo worn brakes and then I find everything still 
spins nice.   I dab a little grease on the shoes where they slide into the 
star thingys too.

Unfortunately, not so many people realise how good grease is.  Only one bus 
I've looked at brakes on that I hadn't looked at before had its stars 
greased.  very sad :( 

I use grease from the pot I fill from overflow from greasing the front 
suspension. slightly used.
