Bentley calls for "high melting point graphite grease" on the adjuster
threads.  FWIW, I have some Haynes manuals for later-model US cars and
trucks.  They variously recommend "white lithium-base grease", "high-
temperature brake grease", "high-temperature grease", and "multi-purpose
grease" for the adjuster threads.  They specify the same stuff for the
shoe-web contact areas on the backing plate, which I don't think Bus
brakes have - we don't have a spring that holds the shoe down to the
plate like most American cars do.
