Subject: RE: [VB] Cargo door handle

 Actually I think there are more 67 handles out there then the earlier. In
all my handles and in most of my buses they have and/or are 67 L key
profiles. I have a harder time finding the earlier then the latter. I would
gladley trade L profile handles for any earlier ones.
  My 60 DD 2 L profile, 60 Deluxe L profile, 63 Westy (just aquired) L
profile. I haven't checked my other 5 buses yet to see what they have. 
  I think the reason for this is that after 67 that is all the VW had made
and when ever someone came in with a broken handle , it was replaced with
the later L profile. I still find 67 only used and NOS handles at the swaps
on a regular basis.

ronnie   Wanted and pre 67 cargo door handle (long shaft)

ps. I do find a lot of early panel handle though!

yes, especially because 67 cargo door handles break.  if you see a bus with
a 
broken cargo door handle 95% chance its a 67.  as the key is longer the 
handle is weaker, and yanking the handle eventually breaks it off, (but does

not open the door)

 Hi Paul,
 The 1967 "L" profile key is much longer so no way will your shorter "T" 
 tumbler fit.  If you have "L" profile handles trade them to 1967 owners for

 the "T" ones you need.  Since the "L" profile parts are one year only you 
 will probably have alot of 1967 owners trying to batter down your front
door 
 soon to get those parts!
