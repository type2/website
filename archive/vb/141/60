Subject: Vegas Bound

I just notified that I'm going to Vegas for week on business.  THIS is
why I joined the Air Force!  Anyone out there live in or around Vegas?
Anyone know of a nice DRY vw picking yard?  Or anything VW related?  I'm
staying at the Doubletree (thanks Air Force!)  Anyone want to get
together for beers let me know.  I'm heading out this Sunday and will be
returning next Saturday.
