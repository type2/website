Subject: Re: [VB] Cargo door handle

yes, especially because 67 cargo door handles break.  if you see a bus with a 
broken cargo door handle 95% chance its a 67.  as the key is longer the 
handle is weaker, and yanking the handle eventually breaks it off, (but does 
not open the door)

 Hi Paul,
 The 1967 "L" profile key is much longer so no way will your shorter "T" 
 tumbler fit.  If you have "L" profile handles trade them to 1967 owners for 
 the "T" ones you need.  Since the "L" profile parts are one year only you 
 will probably have alot of 1967 owners trying to batter down your front door 
 soon to get those parts!
