Subject: stereo that fits without any cuttting

Well, the adjustable shaft JVC didn't fit - 1/4 inch too long, 1/8 inch
too high.  So I tried an old Pianola cassette I had also, this time,
height ok, 1/8 too long, shafts too fat.  Other than the Radio shack $50
unit, has anyone found a newer model that fits, keeping the dash stock?
