Hi Adrian,
Actually the hole in the Porsche shims is more of a rectanglish "O" shape.  
We are using the large Porsche pulley nut which sure looks like the 1955ish 
and earlier VW large generator pulley nut.  
  Again as Matt Roberds deciphered:
<<  Stock                       905 mm  35.6 in
Fresh Start 13345 10AV0875  875 mm  34.4 in (This gave us 2.4:1)
Gates       7340            864 mm  34.0 in (This gave us (2.75+:1)  >>
There was a belt in between the Fresh Start & Gates belt sizes and it would 
also be very interesting to try the Porsche generator pulley with the next 
size down stock lower pulley and test for ratio/RPM results!
