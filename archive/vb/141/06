Hi all,

I just flew back to St. Louis from Seattle today where I attended and hel=
ped staff the Cascade Kombi's "Northwest Vintage VW Weekend".  What a gre=
at time, as well as beautiful weather!!!  We drove around all weekend in =
bitchen' old VW's in one of the more beautiful regions of the U.S.A.!!!  =
My buddy Jeff Slater gave me his mega-rare '89 Vanagon "Tri-Star" Syncro =
"four" door Double-Cab to use during my stay.  What an incredible and ver=
satile truck!!!  I stayed over a few extra days after the event was over =
to play some more and to pallet/crate up a bunch of large VW items my bud=
dy Jeff has been storing at his place for me for too many years now.  The=
 "Tri-Star" hauled the car trailer with the two big pallet/crates full of=
 goodies down to the freight forwarder on Tuesday morning and they will a=
rrive at the freight depot in St. Louis on Monday.  Among the cool items =
coming home are a working 1960's vintage Coca-Cola vertical rack vending =
machine (soon to reside in my garage loaded up with various beers instead=
 of sodas), as well as my long awaited 25hp motor and four complete Oval =
window convertible doors and a bunch of other VW Bus and Beetle stuff.  A=
mong many event sawp meet purchases, I bought two used "light blue" rear =
cargo area Split-Bus floor mats.  I'm planning to use 'em in the BNNTA ev=
ent '59 Panel Bus.  If anyone local to St. Louis really needs a used "blu=
e" rear floor mat (really hard to find!) and has a comparable condition "=
black" one that they want to trade, let me know.  I don't care what color=
 I use in the BNNTA event truck, although I guess black would be more cor=
rect.  Anyway, what a fun weekend that was!!!

Wow, bummer to hear about Ted Morris's stolen Bus.  Dave Easterwood, plea=
se pass along our condolences and our wishes for a speedy location and re=
covery of Ted's Bus!

Everything is right on track for the 18th "Busses Nowhere Near The Arch" =
at Mark Twain Lake near Hannibal, Missouri held over the upcoming Labor D=
ay holiday weekend.  See either www.BussesByTheArch.com   or  www.BNNTA.c=
om  for basic event info.  We've heard from the Houston, Texas Bus gang w=
ho are caravaning up again this year (they attend every other BNNTA) with=
 their famous Texas theme encampment.  The DBG have planned a new surpris=
e theme this year for the "Best Group Campsite" award competition, and I'=
m sure that both the Missouiri Micro's and the Buskatier's will be cookin=
g up theme encampments to entertain the attendees and vie for votes.  We =
look forward to seeing many of you and your VW Busses streaming into the =
Indian Creek Group Campground on Mark Twain Lake in about a month from no=
w for the VW camping festivities!

See ya soon!
