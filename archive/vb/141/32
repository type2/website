Hi Paul,
The 1967 "L" profile key is much longer so no way will your shorter "T" 
tumbler fit.  If you have "L" profile handles trade them to 1967 owners for 
the "T" ones you need.  Since the "L" profile parts are one year only you 
will probably have alot of 1967 owners trying to batter down your front door 
soon to get those parts!
