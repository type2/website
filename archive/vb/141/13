Thanks for the reply.  Are 66 and 67 keys different?  My drivers door and engine lid lock are different to the other locks - slightly longer keys and appear to be VW but aren't the cutout VW sign.
Would a barrel from a 66 lock fit in a 67 door handle?  I have got a NOS engine lid lock on the way so the only bad handle is the cargo handle, and the lock on the drivers door is of a different style but I think must of been NOS when it was fitted 6 years ago.

Thanks
Paul
