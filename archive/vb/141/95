Hi Rex,
BTDT!  On our 1960 panel camper conversion.  Took us three hours to 
heat/quench & pry off the forward shift coupler off with plumber wrenches the 
rear shift linkage.  We got from Clara after we cut the nose off a rusted 
beyond belief 1960 panel van she was parting out to get the two pieces out.

 This is the metal coupler up kinda underneath the cab of the truck. I guess

You best bet is to cut the coupler length wise both sides and remove or cut 
it widthwise so you can at least get the shift linkage pieces out of there.  
Remember the shift rods are hollow tubes that are very easy to 
crush!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Only the very ends are filled with solid plugs of steel.

Shiftrods no!  the forward coupler we think we heard is availible repro, but 
quality sucks.
