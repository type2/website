Subject: pulley ratio copulation


To the Knowledgeable and Friendly List Members,

This pulley ratio thread has been great for the list.
Could someone review all the tips on this subject (airflow for stock
and oversize cc engines type 4 coolers or not, freeway flyer trans 
or not, with parts sourcing etc. all aimed at increased /more 
efficent cooling for the library on the type2 site?
Or maybe offer a aftermarket "modern airflow kit" (ronnie?)

aloha
Ken
