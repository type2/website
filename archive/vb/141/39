Hi Adrian,
That would make sense if the type 1 pulley ended up to far forward.  The 
Porsche pulley we found worked fine once we shimmed the pulley halfs just a 
tad to the rear.  Since this pulley is a three piece item we just installed 
shims between the inner piece and the forward pulley half to realign it.  Are 
912 and 356 generator pulleys the same?   Eric&Barb
