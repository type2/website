It's not unheard of.  Heat and vibration are probably the main
killers of coils.  The primary (low voltage) side of the coil is
a few turns of heavy wire, but the secondary side is a metric
buttload (2.2 Imperial buttloads) of really really thin wire.
To pack it all in the coil, instead of the usual plastic or
rubber insulation, the wire will have a thin layer of varnish.
Heat can break this down and vibration can rub through it, causing
shorts.  Vibration can also break the wire where it's connected
to the terminals on the inside.  The high voltage can also break
through dodgy insulation and damage the wire further.

It might be enlightening to cut open the old coil to see what
you can learn.  Do it somewhere where a mess is acceptable as
there will be sticky oily asphalty stuff in the coil.
