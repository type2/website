Subject: RE: [VB] pulley ratio - 356/912 pulley offset issues?


Bernie Bergmann (about $50 as he recalls).  I got quoted $58.50 for the
three pieces and matching fan belt (no shims).

Just got off the phone with Bernie Bergmann (himself).  He claims there is
no offset issue at all and it just bolts on.  Also he said that the Porsche
adjusting shims are the same as the VW ones... Not true from what I can
tell, the VW ones have a plain round hole in the middle and the Porsche
style should have a "D"/oval center thing going on to make them more stable
against the center pulley shaft...  Plus the Porsche shims are $1 each
whereas the VW ones probably around $1 for a hole pack, there better be a
difference.

Lets compare to Parts Obsolete:   from stoddard (ronnie did this)
912 Hub 		$20.20          20.20
912 Inner Pulley	$11.95          12.30
Belt 825mm 		$6 
comparison purposes)
912 Outer Pulley	$8.75            9.60
You also should use the Porsche nut (18.10) and the shims are different.
Also if you mention a club, or just about anything they will generally give
10% off


Total:		$46.90

Either kit still needs the 9 Porsche shims from Parts Obsolete (or other
Porsche retailer), so add $9 to either figure.  Maybe a new woodruff key for
$.90 if you want to splurge :)

Hopefully this is semi helpful to someone out there :)

... I am thinking a "865-875mm x 10mm from continental" as previously
reported will work well as a belt...  Eric&Barb what are you all running as
a belt again?
