Subject: Parts order report and thanks 

I ordered a windshield seal a week ago Monday for Nikki's bay bus from Bus
depot..it arrived on that friday in a very timely manner. The seal installed
great and even impressed the installer. I didn't get to talk to Ron himself
but the lady handled  my order well despite my accent ,,grin, (its a redneck
thang). I just wanted to say great service and i will try some of Ron's
sheetmetal panels at a later date and report on them as well.
Oh btw Nikki's Bay now has a new nose skin and is done except for some minor
crap tomorrow. Later
