Hi Paul,
We do not know if the later tumbler will fit at all, but if you want the 
later key to work properly you need the later suffixed handle for it to work. 
 The earlier used pins going only one way where the "T" and later keys have 
pins going two ways to make it much more difficult to pick the lock.  
Fortunitly the later E handle is probably the easiest to find of the pre-1968 
bus handles.
