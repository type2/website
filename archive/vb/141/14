Subject: Re: [VB] steering wheel cover

I got a real vinyl leatherette steering wheel cover from Kragens (aka Schucks 
aka Checkers).  The 'truck' size fits the bus.  they also had leather ones, 
but I dunno if they came in 'truck' size.   

I like a steering wheel cover as I have a bone spur at the base of a finger 
which sometimes hurts from driving w/o one.

 You're better off getting a rebuild steering wheel!
