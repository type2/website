Subject: RE: [VB] Air backpressure

I think John Connoly said it best in this snippet:
>Narrowing the tube increases the velocity, but decreases the volume (engine
would run hotter from LESS air). Think of a garden hose; do you get more or
less water when you put your thumb over the end? How MUCH air you get is
what cools your engine off, not how fast it's moving.

The T3 tin although good for stock I think is not good for additional
airflow given John's explanation above.  The key to cooling will be volume
over pressure.

For what it is worth, this is, as far as I can recall, the first issue I
have come to disagree with Bob Hoover on.  Usually his stuff is as good as
gospel :)  (One person you should never question unless you really have a
clue about what you are talking about)

Lets take the same amount of work (which you have to do for any bigger
engine) and do it to the T1 tin and I think the T1 tin will be better given
a higher air flow.  After all each tin can only butt up against the cylinder
fins so close no matter if it is T1 or T3.  The air is shot down the middle
of cylinders 3/4 and 1/2.  Now how do you get sufficient air to the outer
sides of the cylinders?  Less pressure on the sides to create the pressure
drop to flow air in that direction...  Otherwise it puddles in the middle
and straight out the bottom.   

One thing that Hoover mentions is the pressure drops at the heads... In my
view this is over simplified.  Take into consideration the veins in the fan
shroud that direct some air to the heads and some air to the cylinders and
you are not talking a pure clump of unmanipulated air pressure.  The air
directed to the heads mainly will stay at the heads even with a severe
pressure drop somewhere else.  Given the old theory that an object (air) in
motion tends to stay motion in the direction of its given energy path
(severely paraphrasing the theory here).  

Examine the T3 tin closely and someone please explain how "about 1360 cfm (-at-)
4000 rpm." (per Hoover quoting a VW manual) will fit through the tinny T3
bottom holes?  Of course lets say half of that gets used for the heads
(maybe more).       

Lets see how the early Porsche 911T accomplishes the same thing:
http://www.pelicanparts.com/914/Parts/914-6/914-6_sheet_metal_big.htm
Look specifically at part 21.  (note to you all out there running T1 911
shroud look kits #18, air veins! - no T1 kit I have seen addresses this at
all.)

So what can we tell from the 911 lower tin... I am not sure.  Simply it
looks more like a T1 tin setup, but has the curved ridges on the sides
similar to the T3.  I would consider it a hybrid between the two unless
anyone has a better observation than me?

Whew... fingers tired.  Please anyone feel free to comment on observations
of your own.

Take Care,
Adrian

Some information about air flow and air pressure as it applies to cooling
our engines:
