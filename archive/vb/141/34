Subject: Re: [VB] BASF paint codes 

I'm not sure about Canada, but Dupont can mix most VW colors here in the US.
Lucite brand is a waterborne paint (used to be sold in the US as a house
paint!). I don't recommend you use this on a car. It has been tried by a few
auto manufacturers here in the US and then abandoned.

RM is an economy paint line for BASF. It is not Glasurit. Totalally
different formulation. The codes are not interchangable. RM is cheaper that
Glasurit but not nearly as high in quality. RM used to be a separate company
before BASF bought them out, as was Glasurit.
