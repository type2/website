I picked up my 65 singlecab a few weeks ago. I put new brakes on it and =
have been driving it for about a week now.Its soooooo nice to be in one =
again.
 I have got to get some of my accessories on it and wrap my chromie rims =
in new tires and I should be ready to make the trek down to the DKB show =
in November.
 I should have some pics up soon
Right On,
 Bryan
