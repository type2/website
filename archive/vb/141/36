Hi apstockton,
Having a condensor or coil go bad is not common, but can and will happen 
eventually.  Alot of times they will fail in such a way to allow running the 
engine for a few minutes and then it will die till the connection in the 
condensor/coil cool and reconnect and allow for a few more minutes of 
driving.  Either way it is a real pain if you are out in the middle of 
nowhere!
