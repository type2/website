Hi List...
It's Friday, and I'm blonde..
I'm going to look at a stash of old gas heaters a guy has...Is the
"SouthWind" the bus model, are there different models for bus, bug,
etc.?  Anyone have CLEAR diagrams of the bus heater to download?
Thanks guys....I'm putting this in my s/c in the spare tire space.  Also
would appreciate a photo of that installation.
