Hi all.  Is there any way to find out what the M-Code was for a =
particular vehicle by using the VIN? Is this possible to trace...perhaps =
it's on the 'letter from the factory'.
If the title is clear and the police check comes back favorably, is =
there a problem with buying a vehicle that no longer has  an m-code =
plate?  Other than the curiosity of it plaguing me?
Thanks for the help.
Jay, future splitty owner
