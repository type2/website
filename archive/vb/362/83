Bentley says that the tank holds 40 liters or 10.5 US gallons.  Doing
a more precise conversion of 40 liters yields 10.57 US gallons.  I think
that even at the stated capacity, there is supposed to be a little air
space for expansion.  11.2 / 10.57 is 1.06 or 6% space for expansion,
which seems reasonable to me.

If you have a lawnmower gas jug at home, you might empty it out, then
put a known amount of fuel (or oil or even water, but then you have to
dry it out well) and mark that level.  Then empty it again and take it
to the gas station, fill it until the pump says 2 gallons or 5 gallons
or whatever, and see what you've got.  If the pump is way off, this
should probably show it.

I have heard that gas pump errors are measured in tablespoons per
gallon, but http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,480032351,00.html
suggests that it may be in cubic inches.  Here in Oklahoma, the state
Weights and Measures people put stickers on each gas pump.  Typically
there is a slot on the sticker for each grade marked something like
"+2" or "-1".  I think the +2 means you get two free cubic inches or
tablespoons per gallon, and the -1 means you're getting shorted one
cubic inch or tablespoon per gallon, but I could be wrong.

The "consumer action" reporters for TV stations tend to rediscover gas
pump accuracy every time the price of gas goes up by a lot.  Sometimes
they even come up with their own official calibrated fuel jugs and
check out some local stations.
