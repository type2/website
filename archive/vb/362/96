My wife excitedly called me in to watch some months back when it ran the 
first time.  An appalling lack of attention spent during the show on 
properly renovating the stuff that matters (body, suspension, engine) in 
favor of maximum attention on the bling-bling aspects (monster plasma 
TV, couch, surfboard delivery system, clothes dryer).  Plus they messed 
with the engine bay vents to install a 'stop sign'!  Morons!  How do 
they think that big motor is going to get any cooling air?

Pissed me off so much after hanging around this list, I just wanted to 
take the jive-talkin' host of this supposed renovation show and push his 
head through that plasma TV.
