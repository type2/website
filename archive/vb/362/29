Subject: Re: [VB] engine won't shut off

 the blinky signal light on the speedo should only come on with the turn signals, and should blink alternatstely with them.   If you look at the wiring diagram, this works with the wire to the base hot with ig on, but is also hot to the blinkgeber, which is is hot on/off with the blinkies blinking.   this means that the light stays on if you don't hook up the blinkgeber.   use a three prong one.
 
something is messed up with the engine staying on.   check your wiring to see what is hooked up funky.

First the symptoms. Turn ignition switch to run position, both idiot lights and the TS blinker light come on as they should. Turn switch to start, and the motor starts right up and purrs. Ahhhh. But the idiot lights, and the Turn signal light do not go off. Turn ignition switch to Off, and the motor just keeps on running. Idiot lights stay on as well. It's as if the switch was never turned off. Go to back of bus and pull wire from coil to distributor to shut 'er off. 
 
If I turn switch to run position, and then back off without starting the motor, the idiot lights come on, and then off as they should. The ignition switch makes the bus behave as expected.
