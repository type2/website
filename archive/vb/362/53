I was pondering this a bit more and hit upon yet another solution.  All
you need is an old gas can you don't mind losing.

1. Put the old gas in the can.
2. Put the can in the back of a pickup.
3. Park the truck in a public place for a few hours.

The can, and the bad gas, is very likely to disappear spontaneously! :)

This may not work so well in honesty-infested parts of the country!
