Subject: dual kadrons on SP???

i have some questions for the dual carb gurus. i acquired what i believe to 
be a set of kadrons from a 1600 DP (markings say Solex 40/44 EIS). they 
still have the DP manifolds on them. i want a set of dual carbs for my stock 
1500 SP and thought these might work. i cant seem to find an adapter that 
will mate them to SP manifolds. the carb base studs are 2.75" apart.

can these be made to fit on a SP? fabricating plates isnt in the budget, 
cuuz i still have to get SP manifolds. if they dont work they guy that i got 
them from will take them back. but they are about 250 miles from new and are 
a GREAT deal.

thanks for the help!!
