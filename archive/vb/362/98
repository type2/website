Subject: Pimp my ride question

Here is a good question. How much air does that sign on the side of that bus 
block??? Would that sign block more air than a gas heater stuffed in the 
driver battery compartment??? I'll agree it wasn't a pretty site but, that is an 
opinion. The guy who got a free paint job and some expensive electronics seemed 
to be very very happy. All the accessories can easily be removed and installed 
in his house. He got a decent paint job and turned a faily rough bus into a 
pretty nice bus. Nothing they did wasn't repairable. Other than folding up that 
bumper. That wasn't a pretty sight. I am interested in the facts of the 
cooling. My guess is that noone can tell me for sure that the sign will effect the 
cooling. I've questioned it many times since the show first aired and I have 
yet to get a real answer just opinions and remember how tight a gas heater is 
stuffed in that compartment. 
I see that most here are into the original look. So please leave out ruining 
a perfectly good bus. That bus is far from ruined. The bodywork wasn't top 
notch but, for free it's hard to beat. For someone with no money that was great 
work. Turned a fairly rough bus into a pretty nice looking bus.
