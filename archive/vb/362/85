I've seldom used anything else.  Charcoal ligher fluid is not very
flammable, probably to save the lives of the idiots who spray the stuff on

Gasoline, being more flammable, requires a different technique, namely
"stand way back when igniting!"

YMMV, proceed at your own risk, caveat emptor, LS/MFT
