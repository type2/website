Seann's story about gasoline in the coffee can reminds me of an incident
that happened in a town where I lived about 20 years ago.  A local
doctor had bought a new car, and after driving it around for a few days,
noticed that it had started leaking gas.  He took it back to the dealer,
who told him they were too busy to fix it that day, and to bring it back
tomorrow.  He drove it home, parked it in his garage, and closed the
door.  When he went into his garage the next morning, he noticed a pool
of gas on the floor (wide pool of gas means lots of surface area for
evaporation).  Deciding that he needed to clear out the gas fumes, he
reached for the electric door opener.

My boss at the time lived three houses away.  He said that it sounded
like a bomb had gone off.  By the time the fire trucks got there ten
minutes later, the house was beyond saving.  The doctor and his wife
survived, although they both spent over a year in the hospital with
third degree burns.  They sued the car dealer, although I never heard
how that turned out.

That story has made me appropriately nervous whenever I have a gas
spill.
