This looks oddly familiar... searching the mental archives... ah ha!!!  Now 
searching the www.dropgates.com Single Cab Gallery... no, not there... must 
be in the "WTF Were They Thinking" category... TaDa!  Picture #125 in the 
9th section.

Why was I able to recall this?  Don't know, so don't ask.  I'm not exactly 
proud of it.   :o)
