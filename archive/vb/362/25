I went from parallel front wheels to slight toe-in at about 1/10 inch
by turning the tie-tod one full turn. The handling improved a lot,
wheels come back straight faster at the end of turns are steering is
easier. Wandering at 60 mph is largely reduced. Also bus seems to
brake more straight.

Also greased the front end "a la Hoover" : changed all grease not just
add some. The front suspension feels smoother, but maybe it's just a
belief  :)

Is there no place to use the new grease gun on the back of a baywindow
? I did not find it in Muir.
