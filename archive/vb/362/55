Hi Mark,
If it was my choice I'd go with Bilsteins. I have them on my
' 63 15 window deluxe and love 'em. Recently made a trip to
San Diego, Cal, starting from Oak Harbor in Washington state (a little more
then an hour's drive south of Canada border)
and back. Smooth , firm ride...gotta love it!
The part numbers you call out for front and back are correct.
Don't forget the lifetime warranty when you buy those guys.
I'd also replace the steering damper at the same time.
Part number for it is....B22-0028
I don't know if Bilstein has a web site, but I imagine they do.
Check there for dealers in your area. If you can find them on the web
for $ 60. or $70. I'd go for it. Thats a good price.
