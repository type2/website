Subject: re:shock recommendations

Check out busdepot.com-that's where I got replacements shocks for my bus.
Ron over there has some thoughts on them...

I got new tires and shocks at about the same time, and haven't finished the
tire install-need to get them balanced still...so I'm not sure what has
improved my ride -but probably a combination of both.
