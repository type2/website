Subject: 23? window sighting today

Hey all,

I don't write much on here because I usually don't have much to 
say.  Today while motoring along in wonderful Western New York 
on the Youngman Thruway, I saw the top of a 23 window (no 
windows) cut at the beltline with the jailbars still in the corner 
windows.  It looked like the bus was mostly complete, except 
that it was cut in two and fairly rusty.  I would estimate it to be 
about a 60.  It had lots of rust, but I'm sure in the capable hands 
of some people on this list, it would definitely be considered 
salvageable.  It was on a trailer being towed by a Ford extended 
cab pickup.  Both the pickup and the trailer had Texas plates.  If 
it was anyone on the list - have a safe trip back to Texas.  If not, 
it looks like another rusty 23 window was saved by some lucky 
(or cursed) person.

Paul
