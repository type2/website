Subject: fililing the tank

Hi guys a quick question about my tank...I went to get gas the other day,
and I figured my tank was low(gas gauge has been working intermittently for
a while now). Anyway I managed to put 11.2 gallons in. I didn't know this
was possible. I was thinking the pumps were not calibrated correctly. Could
the hot weather affect those readings? I have the original tank, whichI
thought was 10 gallons. I could imagine putting in a little over 10...but
11.2?

I don't want to give the gas station a hard time by calling an inspector-but
11.2 gallons seems like way too much.

Thanks,
