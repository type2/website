Subject: RE: [VB] Type 4 oil cooler in a doghouse

Hi,
I recently did this conversion.  The type 4 cooler is 7\8 inch thicker.  It 
has two extra sections.  The height and width are the same.  You will need 
to change the studs that hold it on.  The ones from a type 4 motor are 
correct.  Basically the doghouse needs to be extended 7/8 of an inch. It 
would be difficult without welding but I guess it would be possible.
Good Luck,
Boyd Smith
