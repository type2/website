Subject: engine won't shut off

> Short answer: With some help from Matt Roberds and Ronnie, Got it all

> Nice!

> Long Answer: Alternator is internally regulated, and I had it
> connected correctly.  I had the blinkers and idiot lights connected
> incorrectly at the speedo.  Once I figured all of that out,
> everything works fine, except my fuel gauge because it's 6v and the
> bus is now 12V.

> Thanks everyone for the help!  Now I've got to tackle all of the
> crazy things I discovered once I got it on the road (adjust drag
> link, brakes, accel cable sticks a bit, clutch needs to be a bit
> tighter, aim headlghts).  Does it ever end?  Fun though, isn't it!
