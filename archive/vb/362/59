Hey Volks

Many of you will know that VWSA assembled a run of Brazilian-built split buses
in the 1975 model year which were sold under the model name Fleetline. These
were probably the last split buses built anywhere, as split production ended
in Brazil in 1974 or 75.

It has been fairly widely published on the web that there were only 789
Fleetlines built, while others say that the number may have been as many as
2,000 Fleetlines. Anyone who used the 789 figure was quoting me. This number
is incorrect. I have now discovered a definitive source of production figures
for Fleetlines and it turns out that there were between 5,000 and 6,000
Fleetlines built between January 1975 and March 1976. So Fleetlines are still
rare, but not as rare as I had believed.

I recently located an old copy of the Commercial Vehicle Data Digest, a local
publication that gives technical and other specs on vehicles sold in SA.

According to the Commercial Vehicle Data Digest:

Fleetline introduced: January 1975
Total number sold in 1975: 4,957
Fleetline discontinued: March 1976

In April 76 the Fleetline was replaced by the fugly bay/split hybrid, which
had baywindow front bodywork grafted onto the split rear bodywork. The
bay/splits were known simply as "1600" or "Brasilia" (as I have seen it on
some aftermarket parts lists). These were sold until 1978. The Commercial
Vehicle Data Digest lists 1976 sales at 3,446. It is not clear if that refers
to both Fleetlines and bay/splits, so there may have been as many as 6,000
Fleetlines sold in total.

Fleetlines were produced in three variants: 15-window Kombis, panelvans, and
wide-bed single-cab pick-ups.
