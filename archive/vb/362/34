Subject: 60-73 Faucet rubber

Hello,

In my westy i have a faucet like this :
https://pointer.webappcabaret.net/busdepot/details.jsp?partnumber=ZVW223101

It needs a new rubber seal in the pump. The current seal is crushed
and does not permit the pump to pump. Anyone knows where to get the
rubber seal only ?

I'm also looking for a clip that clips the round oil bath air cleaner
to support frame.

Thanks - Arnaud
