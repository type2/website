All three lights have one side connected to the hot-in-run
wire - circuit 15, black.  The other side of the oil
pressure light is grounded by the oil pressure switch on
the engine to turn on the light.  The other side of the
turn signal indicator light is grounded by the flasher
relay to turn on the light.  The other side of the
generator light is (basically) grounded by the voltage
regulator to turn on the light.

I am not next to a Bus or a Bentley right now, but IIRC,
the ignition circuit (black wires) gets connected to the
outer shell of the bulb sockets, and the wires to the
rest of the car get connected to the male push-on on the
bulb sockets.  These bulbs should be mounted in a plastic
block - isolated from the metal shell of the speedometer
case.

Sounds right...

Could be right, could be wrong.  I would feel better
about it if it was labeled "61" or a couple of other
things besides "D+".

Sounds OK.

Not sure, at this point.  If it had a "DF" terminal then
I'd be pretty sure that it was an external regulator type.

Probably.  You might try this: leave the flasher relay
disconnected, and hook up the fat red wire back to the
B+ stud on the alternator.  Leave the blue generator
idiot light wire disconnected from D+.  Then try the
ignition switch.  If the engine turns off with the
ignition switch, this points another finger at the
alternator hookup.

Not enough information at this point to say how this
regulator should be connected or even if it goes with
the alternator in your Bus.  This is not something you
want to determine by experiment; the generator wires and
battery cables must retain all their smoke to work
properly.

Are there any visible part numbers or logos on the
alternator, and if so, what are they?  How about on
the regulator?
