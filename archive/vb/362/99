Subject: Re: [VB] Pimp my ride question

The bumper was already bent I believe. At least that's what I 
remember. They just pulled it out of the bus cargo area and threw it 
in a pile I think. Could be wrong.

Nothing wrong with that bus they did. I'd be happy if someone took 
one I've got and did all that too it. I'd have no problem driving it. 
I'd bring the TV into my house though. And I'd ditch the sign that 
comes out the side.

And really that was the only thing wrong I think they did. They CUT 
the vents on the side. That sucks. Other than that, everything was 
alright...especially for free. Shiny driver with a pimp interior.
