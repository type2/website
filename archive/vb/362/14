When I first read this I had visions of a seat with a motor in it that
was failing in some way, and thinking, "Why would the power seat crapping
out make it impossible to drive a Bus?  Why would anyone put a power seat
in their Bus?  Is Ronnie's butt really that soft?"  Then I figured it
out.  :)  Thanks for the trip report!
