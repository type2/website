Subject: OCTO Reports?

I missed the OCTO/Classic Weekend this year for the 1st time in a number of
years.

Any reports on underpriced buses, too many rare nos parts to choose from, no
barndoor chicken coops, not enuf volks in SOCAL, no breakdowns, wild goose
chases, etc. ?????

Inquiring minds need to know.
