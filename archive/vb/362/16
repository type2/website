Subject: CHT, Oil temp, fan speed, and jetting ramblings

Hey happy campers!

Well after a good weekend camping out with my daughter in the '66 Westi  I 
can report on some good and bad finding with our new motor.

Background:
-'66 Westi full interior (read heavy)
-IRS rear end with late Super Beetle tranny (read geared pretty high)
-2007 Type1 DP motor (90.5x78.4) 7:1ish comp
-Engle W100 equivalent cam (actually a CB cam) with Single high rev springs
-Doghouse oil cooler with all top tin and Type3 "super cool" bottom tin
-Carb 34 Pict 3 with CB performance stock intake (claimed good for 12% flow 
increase, probably hype) 140 mains other jets unknown
-Dizzy is a Mallory Unilite with vacuum (expensive, time will tell if a 
value)  timing 28 degrees mechanical all in  (with vacuum ?)
-Exhaust is J-tubes with Bugpack header and A-1 phat boy bus muffler (I like 
it)
-Full flow oiling with 26mm pump, but no external cooler, and EMPI 1.5 quart 
deep sump.

I think that is all the pertinent info needed there.

Guages:
Autometer Sport-Comp tach
VDO oil pressure
VDO oil temp (taken from deep sump plate in drain hole)
VDO CHT guage mounted under #3 spark plug

The trip was semi local so just about 25 minutes down the road.  So a good 
shake down drive.

Oil temp never got over 180! :)  I thought it might cook, maybe on a longer 
trip oil temp issues will arrise...

Oil pressure was awesome with the 26mm pump.  Some people say go for the 
30mm HD pump, but I trusted the conservative voices on this issue.

Head temp was pretty wild though and here it gets fun... At idle it would 
stay between 325-350.  On the road puttering around 400.  At speed/load or 
accelleration it would spike to 500!  But oddly enough at 65MPH and 3500ish 
RPM it would start to cool back to 425 and stay there.   I suspect I need a 
faster fan, perhaps the Porsche 356 conversion that has been recently 
discussed.?  Granted the carb needs some serious jet cahnges as well which 
will help the temps and cut out some light pinging under load.  Basically 
hit some 170 mains and 65 idles and see what happens.  Hopefully that will 
get the heads cooler and get rid of the mild pings.

All in all a great journey, although not long distance.  Some people 
complain about a big motor with a tiny carb, but for a bus I only want the 
torque.  And yes it is pretty responsive with the fat torque once under way, 
the gearing kills it to a degree though.  I am used to running the old setup 
1600 with RGBs at 4K RPM and it still ran cool :)  ...  I might have to 
switch to a low geared IRS tranny down the road though to help out cooling.

So far no oil heat problems which really was my main concern.

Take Care,
