Are you going to do a cost page for your project?

What's more important than having the latest ooh-ahh bus or accessory?

Well, for me, it's a place to actually store and work on them, which
keeps the county off my a$$, and makes life nicer in general.

It took almost a year to get the permits, and there have been some
wonderful 'suprises' - like having to get an engineering review *after*
the county planning people had signed off on it and we'd placed the
forms for the foundation.  Or the $4100 'sewer impact fee'  

Oh well, it will be worth it when it's done.   In the mean time, I'm
doing very little bus stuff, and no track days in the 911.

The basics: 25x25 (I tried to make it bigger, The Man said "no");
in-ground lift;  bathroom; 10' walls (actually 10' 11" after accounting
for the stem walls;  6" slab; center of the ceiling will be ~13';  A/C;
ventilation fan;  lots of electical outlets and air hookups.  It will
also have a fridge and microwave, in addition to lots of bench space.
