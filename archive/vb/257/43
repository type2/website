I pulled my .009 a year ago and put a 205 (X) in and have enjoyed a better
average fuel mileage than before an better low end response.

I have a Bosch 010 on my 1600sp now and I like it but I am wondering how it
would run with a vacuum adavnce dist. I have a 111-905-205T but would like to
try to find a VW 111-905-205L (correct year) as well.
 I am guessing this might increase my mileage? I have a 30-1 carb.

Any opinions?
