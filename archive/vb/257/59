Subject: single wheel trailer (patent numbers?)

I brought my singlewheel trailer home today.The frame and wheel assembly are in great shape.The box off so we will have to fab. a new box.The frame has no marking on it other than what appears to be patent numbers.Does anyone know how or where I can look those numbers up?The trailer will be pulled by my singlecab(bus content).
