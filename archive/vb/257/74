Subject: RE: [VB] My current project

I too am building a garage to house my 56 Kombi and create a workshop.

It is 20'x20' (I have a small in town lot) with a 16x6 shed, and has 10'
stub walls to give me 11' inside with a 9' door.  I used 10' stub walls to
get the clearance I need to add a lift later.  It is design in craftsmen
architecture style to match our 1903 craftsman house.  

Thought about adding a grease pit, however the only thing they are good for
is lubes.  Even with Oil changes they don't work well.

Built the whole thing myself with the help of family for pouring and wall
raising.

Once completed I will have electrical and air fitting for pneumatic work,
and it has a garden shed to house ladders, lawn mowers (that I don't want to
accidentally bump the car) and the very noisy compressor.  Also will have a
overhead furnace for heating (no AC needed in Western Washington).

Would like to know where you got your lift and what it costs.
