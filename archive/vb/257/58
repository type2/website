Hi all,



I'd like a survey please. go out and check the hex bolts that are
holding the generator plate onto the fan shroud. and while you're at it,
check the coil bracket bolts.. They should be 6x10 Kamax bolts but what
letters do you have???



I'm in the process of collecting all the hardware for the motor of the
double cab to send of to the chrome shop.  what fun!  And yes Ronnie,
all nuts have an insignia on them . but some are different.  That'll
give you something to look for :-)





TIA for all that have the ambition to go out and look!!!





David
