Hi All,

I have an Ernst galvanized Single Port Single Pipe muffler. NOS, still 
has sticker (1300, 1500, 1600) on it. 211 251 051 E. Does not include 
the tail pipe or hanger.

I'd like to get $69, that includes shipping UPS Ground.

If that's too much for you, just mail me saying you'd like second dibs 
and if I don't sell it this week, I'll get in touch with you. (No 
arguments about price please. First come, first served - no whiners.)

Thanks,
Conrad
