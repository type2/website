I had the same problem with mine.at the time I had access to a machine shop
for free, and was going to reproduce the arm. I was unable to get it
off.later I tried again, but sprayed some penetrating lubricant on it, and
they came off. Unfortunately by that time I no longer had access to a
machine shop..
