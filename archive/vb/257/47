In addition to that,

I have also heard that one can use a Pertronix or the like by modifying the points plate on the 010.  I took a gander and it looks almost as simple as grinding down a small tab, but I just can't find the time.

Don't ask Ronnie...that bastard has never had any 010 parts for me =)
