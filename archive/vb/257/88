Subject: RE: [VB] costco canopy tarps

I agree that there is an ethics question involved.  However, these are not
my ethics, just something I heard from a guy at work, and I am not one to
judge others, especially on this very gray area.

Secondly, when Ronnie says: "I have decided to sh$t can the costco
shelters", I assume he is dissatisfied.  

I read a very good book recently called "Ask!: The Revolutionary New Guide
for Getting Total Customer Satisfaction" and the author made a good
statement.  Business treat you like a customer, you should treat business
like a business.  If you treat businesses like they are person, then you
imply different ethics.  This is very true when dealing with a chain store
like Costco.  For example, if you went to a friends house and the coffee was
cold you would never say anything (aka Emily Post), however if you go
Starbucks and the coffee is cold you ask to have another.

More About the Book:

/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/104-3852654-4526305

One thing to consider is that Costco bought the cheapest car canopy they can
find, so that they can sell it cheap and have greater profits, they expect
to get some returned, it works into a profit equation they have for all
products.  If more people returned the canopies then they would have
different numbers to plug into the equation and they might buy better
canopies.

I don't not want to start any flames, and this is the last post from me on
this subject.  Hopefully you find the respond intelligent and it doesn't
offend both of these are my intentions.

They might do this, but is it really ethical to take advantage of this to
replace worn out power tools?
