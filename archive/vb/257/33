Subject: Re: [VB] June's OCTO Shirt Question...

Taylor and all:

Looks like Ricky's bus is immortalized on a shirt!  Although the silk screener took some creative liberty in giving Ricky's bus a 2-tone paint job =)

I am pretty certain that was his bus....the foglights are one thing, but Ricky also has his license plate mounted on the passenger side of his bumper....and his Tom Connor racks.

Now the 5 million dollar question....anyone on the list have 2 extra t-shirts?  Or know where I could get some?
