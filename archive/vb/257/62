I looked thru one time. doing searches for volkswagen yeilded some aftermarket vanagon parts and
found some porsche stuff too.If you have the patent number your in luck, cause its a pain otherwise.
When you find the patent you want to view, once in- make sure you find the IMAGES link and youll get
some cool blueprints. Although i just tried and the images dont seem to load. May have to have some
viewer installed like quicktime or something.
