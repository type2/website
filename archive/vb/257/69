The advantage that air shocks give, is when you pressurize them with air,
they extend and raise the vehicle up. Normally installed on the backs of
trucks for when they tow a heavy trailer to keep the vehicle sitting level.

It's been hard finding information on them, but after searching for a while
last night, it looks like the Gabriel Sky-Jacker shocks might end up working
for me (if any airshock will). The shocks can be run without any air
pressure, which is great, so the ride will remain normal for most of my
driving.

I just wish I had the means to install them before this weekend. This
Saturday i'll be taking my bus down the Skyline Drive in Utah. 90 miles of
unpaved road along the top ridge of a mountain range. I want to organize a
bus cruise for the guys here in SLC, but figure I better go 'scout' it out
first just in case. Last thing I want to do is drag up a half dozen buses to
some sort of horrible experience. Better make sure it's kosher first.  :-)
