Subject: RE: [VB] costco canopy tarps

And we think places like Costco, Sams and Walmart are ethical? Heh! Yeah,
they treat the employees like gold...personally, I don't have a problem
returning a something I have beat the tar out of and telling them it is
broken. They get credits from the vendor for most of the stuff any ways...

They might do this, but is it really ethical to take advantage of this to
replace worn out power tools?  Sounds like a good way to make things
harder on people who return with legitimately defective goods.
