The lift is actually pretty stable.  I tried rocking the bus when it was 
on the lift, and it didn't want to move much.  Once it goes in the pit, 
I'm going to fab up an 'outrigger' setup that will tie the lift platform 
to the slab.  Basically I'll raise the lift all the way, set the outrigger 
under it, then settle it down 1/2" or so.  

I think a full pit would be a waste of money for the home mechanic doing 
oil changes.  There's not much else you could use it for other than oil 
changes, and the expense and liability would pay for a lifetime
of JiffyLube oil changes and even a few blown motors when they forget
the drain plug.
