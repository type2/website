Wow!  I hope that you gave the concrete crew the beer _after_ the concrete
was placed!

I can see a few items still to be added to the list.

It seems that the toilet really added a lot to the cost of the project.
Sure a porta-potti wouldn't have been sufficient?  :)

In any case, my 8x15 shed project certainly pales by comparison!
