Subject: Re: Tie Rod Ends

Hello Everyone

    I am looking for a part number for my tie rod ends on my 65 bus . It is
for the left drivers side that the two tie rod ends come off of the tie rod
itself. I bought a couple from a local VW shop yesterday but they are the
wrong ones. I was wondering if anyone would have the part numbers off  hand.
The ones that I got are to big for the tapered holes in the Spindel and
Draglink arm.


Please help,
Thanks
