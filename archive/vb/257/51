Hi Bill,
Of the two pre-1961 headlight switches we have for our DEC1959 built 1960 
wallk thru panel camper, both are Euro types!  Due to the riveted parts of the 
headlight switch it is likely even an NOS switch will have corrosion in it to 
cause voltage drop, so we would rebuild even an NOS one.  We had a simular 
problem when we installed an NOS ignition switch in our 1963 SC.  The first couple 
of twists of the key did nothing and the third or so finally rubbed off enough 
corrosion off of the internal contacts to start the engine!
