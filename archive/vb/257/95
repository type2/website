Subject: flames

Hi All,

 

For my double cabs birthday (may 19), I took the spring plates down to
my paint guy for a few flames. we also put some subtle flames on the
steering column tube (as per RichardB's suggestion for at least some
flames in the interior).  I posted a few pics up on Vintagebus.com and
updated two of my own web pages.  

 

VN's need not respond unless you have that data on the 5D vs 8G 6x10mm
kamax bolt question I posted earlier ;-)

 

 

 

David
