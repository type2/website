Subject: RE: [VB] My current project 

My current project turned 1 year old last week. He is now up walking and
conquering the da, ga, ta-ta, sounds and knows how to say "hi~!" Funny thing is
that he and his sister are better at programming the VCR than I am. ;-o

Matt Drudge felt it necessary to make 115 degrees in Phoenix as a headline.
Pfft! to us it is like seeing a headline about the sun rising in the East at
the start of the day. Duh!

I still have to stuff the axles back into the front end of the Diesel Dasher.
It should be a one hour job but has been on the back burner for about two
months. Landscaping and OT at the employers has kinda taken a priority.

My garage? hahaha. It opens facing an alley in a "diverse" neighborhood and is
used as a storage area. My backyard is as big as Ronnies new garage. My point
being is that all wrenching is done in the full sun driveway or at night by
spotlight after the troops have gone to bed.

'63 EZ camper was deregistered last week to save dinero. I might get to putting
it back together by... let's say January.
