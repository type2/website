the chrome phillips head machine screws that point down on eitehr side of the 
column have the same thread as the 10mm hex bolts on your bus.   they are 
like the pancake bay engine tin screws but chromed.

The bolts/nuts holding the bracket to the pod are the 13mm (or 14mm if your 
bus is earlier)deals everywhere on your bus.

hope that helps
