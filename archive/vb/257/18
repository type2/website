Hi Kevin,
First using qaulity parts goes a long way.  The clips with the full circle 
spring area instead of just a "U" shape just work better.  Use only TO bearing 
arms/shaft with welded bead around the arms base where they meet the shaft to 
prevent having them bend or even break off.  Lastly making sure the TO bearing 
is centered side to side in relation to the tranny input shaft.  This last 
step requires shimming or if less than a 1/32" off, slight bending of the arms.  
Otherwise if a TO bearing is off center the bearing is shoved side to side 
when the clutch is engaged wearing out the TO bearing arms to the point the clips 
simply fall off because there is not enough tension/space on them!!!  Also do 
not sit at lights with clutch pedal pressed down for long periods unless you 
are first or second in line and even then you can figure about when it is time 
to shift from nuetral to first before the light changes.
