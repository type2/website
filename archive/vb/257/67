Subject: yosemite here i come

I am getting ready
I have the singlecab sort of packed and the bike in the back.
Somehow I will leave Cupertino around 5:30 tomorrow.
See you then
It is going to be hot and I do wonder why I am using the singlecab vs. then 
AC 87 Westy, but I am going to enjoy the tent.
