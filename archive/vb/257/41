Subject: Persistence pays off (Was Wheel balancing in CT?)

I guess the moral of this search is keep asking.  The local garage/tire 
shop where I bought the tires originally said they didn't have the 
adapter. Which led me to call about 25 other tire shops with no luck.  
But then when I went back today,  I asked again, and persisted, and lo 
and behold, they poked around, and found it buried in a corner.  The 
owner eventually came by and said "VW bus wheels???"

They'll have my tire business from now on, as i begged them not to 
"lose, or get rid of it, and if they were to get rid of it, I'd buy it 
off them"
