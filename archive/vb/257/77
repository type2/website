Subject: RE: [VB] Seattl Vintage Meet 7/19

I will be there and any looking for a caravan that would be going South from
Vancouver or Bellingham on I-5 on Friday to get to the Burger Meat.  Top
speed is 55 mph, so I will be going Hwy 9 most of the way.  

So the offer is to skip out of work with me on Friday and travel at turtle
speeds down the old hwys -- how can you refuse :)
