The standard reference for VW distributors is
http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ignition.htm and
http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ovhignbo.htm .  According to that, your
distributor is stock for a Beetle from '49 through December '53, and
for a Bus from March '55 through '59.

The only listing in those pages like that is a 113 905 205 AN for a
'72 or '73 stick Bug (1600 DP).
