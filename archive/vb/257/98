Hello!
I just thought I'd add something here. I work at a VW dealer in the parts 
dept. Dealers use these ETKA computers now. Unfortunately they dont even have a 
SECTION for split Buses! Just the 68-79 models. There's a section for I think 
every other VW model sold in this country except for 67 and down Buses. So it 
seems you'd have to find a dealer who kept parts manuals around for ages to get 
something looked up for your split. It's prejudice I tell you. Take care all!
