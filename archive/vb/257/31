Hello Guys     What Eric & Barb say is right but some other things you can do 
to help. Wire tye the clips to the crosshaft that way they can't fall off. 
Also don't use the real heavy pressure plates ie like the 1700lb kennedy all 
that will do is over stress the crosshaft and break the TOB legs. Later and have 
fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va
