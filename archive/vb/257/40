Subject: Air shocks on a bus?

I like to take my bus camping and down a lot of dirt roads that aren't well
taken care off. I've already dented one of my overrider uprights this summer
because I didn't have enough ground clearance (oops!).

My question is, has anyone installed those air shocks on thier buses for
added ground clearance? My idea, is to only fill them when i'm about to go
off the main road, then air them back down when I got back on pavement. Is
the ride normal when they are 'deflated'? Would they help lift the bus a
couple more inches?

I've heard that the shock mounts are not made to handle weight like that,
but i've also seen a number of buses and bugs use fancy coil overs and
remove the torsion bars alltogether (a rod with a swivel in the middle
replaces the torsion bars). Although probably not a good idea for the long
run, they seem to do fine as far as parts failure, and if I'm only using
them a couple times a month, it should be fine.

Anyway, i'm looking for a couple inches of extra lift when pressurized, and
keep a good ride when deflated. Anyone with personal experience with them? I
had a friend a couple years ago that had them on the back of his "bitchin"
71 camaro, and it seemed to ride fine, but you never know what it will do on
a VW!

TIA
