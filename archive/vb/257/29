The situations reported in this thread are only a few of the reasons that I
am so glad I live in AMERICA! I am in an unincorporated part of the county
(in Kentucky) and we don't even have a real building code or any of those
other pesky regulations.

Now, a man down the road was cited last year and forced to clean up his
property, but we're talking almost 40 years of accumulated junk, autos, farm
equipment, appliances, etc. It was a bit excessive, even by my incredibly
lax standards.

have fun,
