Subject: RE: [VB] My current project

  My new shop is also almost done, trade outs are a bitch. We have 3 walls
done and the roof on and I am waiting for them to finish the front wall with
the 10X12 roll-up door. I also had an 8X8 door on the backside so it is a
drive through, with an entry door next to it. 
  I took a different approch to building, we did a car-port first 24X18
(needed to leave room for the 50X35 garage that is going up next to the
current one) and after it was signed off by the city started to enclose it
using steel stud construction. It also has a steel roof on hat tracks with
the insullation under that. The inside height is 13'6".
  All the framing is supposed to be done by today or Friday at the latest,
then it's on to foam insullation, wire and stucco with a Southwestern theme

ronnie, the first one

I've more or less been in the same boat. My shop is up now, but still needs 
to have electrical and interior finished. But I've got some VW's in there 
and have done some a very little bit of work on them in there. I've been 
doing the Double Cab Rat Rod project under the carport. Kinda fits the 
theme though.

My biggest problem hasn't been "the man" (I live in rural west 
Texas)....it's been more time and especially money.

It's 25' X 25', and won't be quite as nice as Thom's. But I've got a 
separate 10' X 20' garage to use as a parts house and tool storage.

I'm like Thom, I'm working towards a more confertable future. It's a hobby 
after all and it'll make it more enjoyable for me.
