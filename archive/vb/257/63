Subject: Re: [VB] 5D vs 8G

Looking at my original motors that are easily accesible:
One og 25hp motor- all 5D for fan and coil
One og 36hp motor- all 5D for fan and coil
One 36hp with mismatched- all 5D for fan except for one "65" (or 6S if you think its an S, its dark
outside) and both 5D on coil.

So now you have one more letter desigantion to add to your list, 65/6S. But that mismatched bolt
looks like its off another part of a VW because the head of it has some dove blue paint on it? cant
think of what tho.

You didnt want non 36 hp stuff did you? I got some 15/1600 laying around i could check.

Ill tell you the rest when i move some stuff here in the next few months if your still interested.
