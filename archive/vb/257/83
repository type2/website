Subject: RE: [VB] costco canopy tarps

  If you go to Costco's web site and look up the canopy they have an address
and phone of the importer. The replacement parts come out of Washingtom. All
you need is your reciept, they have a 3 year warranty. When I got my
replacement top (warranty) they sent all the canvas pieces (sides, top and
back) they do not send any bungees as all mine broke when the top went bye
bye. The second top is allready wasted,1 1/2 years later so I have decided
to sh$t can the costco shelters and just build a nice wood carport to house
the one bus that fits under it. We can legally put up storage with-out a
permit as long as it is less then 120 square feet, so 8 feet by 15 would
easily cover a bus. 
  My new garage which is almost complete 18X24 with 13' 6" ceilings is
almost complete and I will be able to house 4 in there when I put the hoist
in(2 post 7000 lb, old one from the shop) so I will only need 3 more
shelters to hide the rest that are at home!
