Hi Tom,
Best to use no sealant on an outer rear wheel bearing cover.  If it turns out 
that the sealing surfaces have been scratched or damaged in some way then 
using a high temp silicon sealant will work, but only in very small amounts.  
We prefer to finger paint the sealant onto any paper gaskets if needed.
