The show was nice, a lot of Buses but not too many people walking around,
no crowds at all.

I picked up a couple parts for my Kombi, although most were just deliveries
that I had already purchased.

By the way, I need either one or a pair of these headlight lenses:

If people could check their extras, it would be much appreciated.
