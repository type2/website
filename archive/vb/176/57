Hello all,

I finally found a doghouse shroud with all of its
goodies over the weekend but I had to get the
alternator that was attached to the fan because it
didn't have all of my sockets. Anyway, I was thinking
that if it worked I could use it anyway for other
projects ('70 Westfalia). So here's the question(s):
can I test it myself to see if it works? And if so how
do you do that and what do you need? It is also one of
those Bosch ones that has the three prongs on it plus
the sending (B+ ?) terminal, it's off of a '74 Bug.
