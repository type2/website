Subject: looking for dash parts

Hey, I have a 67 13 window deluxe with a dash that was cut. I'm needing one of
the long prongs that make up the vent just to the right of the radio. some
idiot cut one out of my dash. If anybody can help please email me. I'm also
looking for some orginal mesh platinum interior panels.
thanks
john
