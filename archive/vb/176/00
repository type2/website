  You will need to fab a front mount. BB and WG solid mount to the trans,
causing vibration. The way we make them here is to install the front rubber
mount on the nose cone. We then take a piece of 1/4 inch thick by 3 inch
flat stock cut the width of the cast piece on the torsion and bolt it to the
mount. We then install the trans completely and hook up the shift coupler.
After all is done we cut 2 more pieces of the flat stock, radius one end to
match the curve of the torsion housing, cut the other end the angle of the
nose cone plate, hold all in place and weld on. This way everything is
connected correctly and the front of the trans is still rubber mounted. One
of these days We'll build some kits for the conversion
