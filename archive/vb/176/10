Subject: Battery Discharge Light

I've got a 74 Bus and the battery discharge light on the far left stays
on even if the ignition switch is off.
I've just been disconnecting my battery until I can troubleshoot the
problem.
At night when I connect or disconnect the ground wire I can see slight
sparking ............. but when I put a test light between the ground
cable and the body the test light bulb doesn't light.
If there was heavy current flow the light should come on ????
This current draw kills my battery (new) in about 36 hours.
My main concern is that there is a short that could cause a wiring fire.
The light is only on when the ignition is off.
The light goes off when I turn the ignition on.
The light stays off when the engine is running.
This bus has a 12v electrical system.
Anybody had this problem?
Where should I start with my investigation?
