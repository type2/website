What has worked for me with a frozen switch is WD-40.  Just spray it into
the switch (right around where the knob connects to the switch), grab the
knob (get an old knob that you're not going to use any more for this) with
some pliers and just start working the switch.  It worked for a frozen
headlight switch for me.  Good luck.
