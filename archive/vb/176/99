Subject: Slide in Step Question

I recently obtained a (VWOA?) slide in style step for my 65' bus. The step
is common enough it has two brackets which slide into the jacking points and
is joined by a piece of brushed aluminum which foms the "step".

My question is how was this step originally secured to the jacking points.
There appears to be the remenants of a threaded bolt, so I assume that a
hole was intended to be drilled into each of the jacking point and the bolt
somehow threaded into the bracket? Conjecture here, anyone have of these
steps and care to comment.

I have a big phobia of  busting out drill bits on my bus (even if it is
outriggers) so would at least like some information before deciding how to
proceed.
