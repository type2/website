Subject: FS: Doghouse remote cooler kit and other cooler stuff

After a long weekend at the bone yard I found something I read about a while 
ago here:  http://type2.com/rvanness/oilcool.htm

Anyway if anyone wants to try this out I have an Audi 5000 Turbo remote 
doghouse filter mount for sale*.  $15 w/o cooler.  Or $40 with a T4 cooler 
(You just need to add longer through bolts to hold it on).  Or $30 with a T1 
doghouse cooler mounted up and ready.  The mount is nice and clean still 
with the cadmium plating.

*Not all the Audis come with a doghouse cooler.  About 50% that I saw had a 
small Mesa design unit which is entirely different than the doghouse setup.  
It is a crappy cooler that is unusable due to the odd bung layout it has.

Long story there but since I am going to stick with a T1 doghouse cooler in 
my engine with the RX-7 oil cooler I have the T4 cooler to spare.

Also I have a couple Volvo oil coolers for sale.  They are a Mesa design and 
medium in size.  Perfect for mounting under a battery tray in a bus or above 
the tranny (as in hot rod Beetle style), of course mount fabrication is 
necessary.  Actually the mounts will be super easy since there are 8 6mm 
nuts on the cooler already, just get some metal strips and make a hanger for 
it then drill the hole and screw it on.  If you cannot tell already I really 
like these :)  $30 each and I have two - or both for $50 (saves gas to the 
post office).  Both nice and clean.

And finally I have 2 early Mazda RX-7 oil coolers FS.  This is the big fat 
daddy of all oil coolers :)  Built in oil thermostat and the whole 9 yards.  
If you have a massive engine or turbo this is a nice option.  I am mounting 
mine under the cargo floor with some custom mounts, but easy to install 
since it comes with flanges at the ends.  Anyone under 2.0L this is overkill 
see the Volvo cooler.  $75 each and I have 2 FS.  
http://www.mazdatrix.com/b6.htm for more info, the picture does not do it 
justice as it is like 2' long.  This is what Thom needs as a front cooler in 
his 911.  Low mounted so I need to clean them, but you will receive them in 
great clean condition.

Note that the Audi and Volvo coolers will need a temp thermostat.

Please ask any questions that you have as I am happy to help, not just 
trying to pawn off parts. (I love this custom stuff)

Will horse trade for dizzys 010 or 019.  The German 009 I have now is not 
condusive to my driving style in my bus as the advance comes in too high.

Thanks for letting me waste the bandwidth,
Adrian
