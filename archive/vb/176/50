WHOA!!!  Holy bat rape prices Batman!

At these prices I have about 2 million dollars worth of crap in my basement.

Seriously, this seems like a normal Joe selling this stuff and not a shop, 
so basically cut the price in roughly half for something fair.

I hate to flame someone like this, but I do not want a good bus person to 
pay too much.  OR drive prices up artificially.

Caveat Emptor (sp),
