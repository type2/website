Subject: bias plys?

Anyone running bias plys on a regularly driven vehicle? If so how is it? how
do they compare to radials?    I won't be driving it in the rain/snow so
that isn't an issue for me.
Also I've heard of radials that look like bias plys but haven't found
anything with a black wall that truely looks like a bias ply tire. Anyone
else heard of these and/or know where I can get some?
