To be honest I have not inspected the front wires yet. The ones cracking are in the engine
compartment.... so oil might of done some damage. For now though I have no other problems to deal
with - lights are OK, engine runs.... I'll take care of all those little things later.

Thanks.... and if anything I might replace wiring completely... and will take care of the wiper
motor when I get to replacing the nose skin.... easier done when it's off...

peace,

| Sounds like you'ld probably want to remove the wiper motor and regrease it.

| sucks about the wires cracking- but you still might want to check a wiring

| a new wiring harness.   I mean, oil does do the plastic in, so the wires
| crack if they were oily a lot, and I;ve often seen cracked wires in the
| engine compartment.  But cracked wires up front?   Ouch.   I think this is

| think they need one things are hooked up wrong and/or bad grounds &
| connections.   But 40 years of outgassing in the heat might have done yours
