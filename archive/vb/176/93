Long story there but since I am going to stick with a T1 doghouse cooler
in 
my engine with the RX-7 oil cooler I have the T4 cooler to spare.
------------------------ Clip --------------------------
I installed an RX7 oil cooler under my 83 Air-cooled Westy with Type IV
engine last year.
I've never gotten the oil temps over 220 (f) even in NM climbing
Mountains or fighting heavy winds at 100 degrees (f) outside temps.
Great cooler.
