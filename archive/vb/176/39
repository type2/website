I stood behind a certain "aufeaver" who was buying massive amounts of
tickets...wonder if he won anything?  Sorry I didn't say hi Karl, I got
distracted by someone else. 

Great show as usual.  Lots of busses and lots of parts.  Strange as it
seems, I was T3 parts hunting and did fair with an uncracked dash for
cheep and got Gabrial to work his magic on my ignition lock.

A friends Westy hitch went for $600.  Hmmm why is it I'm always spending
money and he's making it??  Oh yeah....he actually sells this crap
instead of just hanging on to it for ever.

Biggest rip of the show I saw was a BN4 that sold at Pomona for $100
(very clean and complete) sitting on the Pomona buyers table today at
OCTO 7 days later for $300!  Lets see that's 28.57 per day for doing
nothing...if he sold it. Ah...commerce.  Got a new heater cable from the
inimitable Ronnie.  There were quite a few NOS things if you wanted. 
Matt from OR had a whole truck bed full of NOS bare bug beams and quite
a few brake drums for busses (not cheep though)

What's up with all the busses "for sale" that really aren't???  A '60
westy (Really nice all OG) for 25K!??  A rusty but complete 60/61???
Westy with tent for 12K!??  Who is going to pay these prices???  Oh well
just jealous I guess ;-)  Fun as usual though.  Great to BS and talk
with everyone on the list the off.
