John-
I can only answer one of your questions, which is how to check your 
alternator's operation. Its pretty straight-forward, first test the battery's 
voltage with the bus NOT running. Should be about 12.5 or so. Next, start her 
up and then check the battery's voltage. Should be at least 13.5, maybe 14. 
This is b/c the alternator has to raise the voltage ABOVE 12v in order to get 
it to take a charge. If the voltages are the same with or w/o the engine 
running, you've probably either got a bad alternator or a wiring problem 
(corroded terminals, etc). Good Luck.
