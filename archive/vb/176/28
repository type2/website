Subject: OCTO.

Visited the OCTO show today. Lots of good stuff. Lots of great people. I
guess photos will show up soon. I won nothing in the raffle. A certain
regular won lots of stuff, no less than 4 of his tickets were a hit. He did
generously give away several of his winnings. A gas door key to myself.
Thanks.

I counted 165 split window buses I am sure I missed a few so the number
might be 175+.

Thanks to the OCTO crowd!!!
