Subject: RE: [VB] bias plys?

I put the old continental bias plys back on the tipper after driving 2000+
miles in june to the octo meet then.  When it came time to go to seattle and
the yakima shows, I left the bias plys on.  I'd have to say the bus wanders
a bit more but you get used to it.  Things are a bit more spongy also...
(highly technical terms there!)

Anyone running bias plys on a regularly driven vehicle? If so how is it? how
do they compare to radials?    I won't be driving it in the rain/snow so
that isn't an issue for me.
Also I've heard of radials that look like bias plys but haven't found
anything with a black wall that truely looks like a bias ply tire. Anyone
else heard of these and/or know where I can get some?
