These three look OK.  As always do not only go by the screwed on plates, but 
the stamped numbers in the body sheet metal itself.  This in the bus is on 
the sheet metal in the right rear of the engine compartment where the forward 
edge of the rear apron screws to.

Incorrect, but close!  According to "Progressive Refiniments".

1JUNE60  chassi # 614 456, engine 5 000 001
 Engine capacity 
Now: 34 bhp./1192 cc.

In otherwords the first true 40HP engine.  Cool!
