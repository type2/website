Subject: Re: [VB] bias plys?

Ronnie-
Well night and day describes the difference. Ride wise the radials are
smoother, handle better, better mileage and better traction in all
conditions. Bias ply anymore are getting scarce and with all the vehicles
coming from the factory with radials. Bais plys are going the way of the do
do. And not wanting to mix bias with radials (on the same axle) due to the
handling issues (not very safe) and the availibility. Price too. You can
pick up radials cheap and get a good tire. Bias would probably cost more and
ride worse. I have had both on cars over the years and radials WIN hands
down. I even have radials on my boat trailer.
