Hi Stan,
Go out and buy the "How To Keep Your Volkswagen Alive A Manual Of Step By 
Step Procedures For The Compleat Idiot".  Then look in the index in the back 
for section  "Red Light On!".  Essentially your regulator has gone bad.
  Hopefully you have been removing only the battery grounding strap at where 
it bolts to the body.  Sparks on the top of the battery can and will ignite 
hydrogen gas and possibly the battery itself.  Bathing you in sufuric acid, 
check out :  http://abcnews.go.com/onair/2020/2020_991101bangladesh.html  for 
what this can do to your face!
