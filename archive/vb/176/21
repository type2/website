Subject: 30 pict 1 accelerator pump rod, which hole?

My 66 30 pict-1 I just rebuilt it, but am uncertain which accel rod hole
(2) I should use. Cleaned up nice, with a 120 and a 55 electro idel jet.
I am thinking the second (more spring tension) hole, was going to test
volume as per betley, but wondering if list wisdom would answer this
quickly.
