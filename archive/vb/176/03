I know how you feel Sonney. I have a problem with one of the so called bus list *approved* vendors
responding to emails. It is probably better to deal with larger suppliers of VW parts. At least you
can get a response from them and have remedies when you need to return something. If you can't get
it from a reputable well-known supplier,  just do without.

It just amazes me that Iz can stay in business. I tried to reach him for a
couple of years after he promised to replace these defective safaris I
bought from him. I ran into another guy at a car show this month who had
more or less the same experience.
I have one of his stickers in my window. I have written into it "They leak,
ask me!"
I'm advertising for him.
