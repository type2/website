Subject: front end knock

Hi all,
After installing my flyer tranny (sweet; very happy with 3.88
conversion; still no worries on Colorado hills) and cruising 1000 smooth
miles, I've begun to notice a knocking sound from my front driver's side
wheel.  It's like a low clunk that transfers through the floor, and
seems to happen with each rotation of the wheel.  It's more noticable
when cruising slowly, but the sound may just be muffled at higher
speed.  Is this bearings for sure?  Any simple checks I can do?  I tried
wiggling the wheel with and without bus pressure, and I get no major
wiggling or strange sounds.  Allignment is a bit off (camber out).  Can
I drive with this condition (I have been sparingly and it doesn't seem
to be getting much worse or affecting driving)?  Any help is appreciated
since I'm still rather unfamiliar with this end of my bus!
Thanks all, mark
