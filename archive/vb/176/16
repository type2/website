Hey Y'all,
I've got a 1600 DP here with an alternator conversion an it is not charging
the battery. Battery is confirmed good. So 2 questions, How do I test an
alternator, and secondly, The alternator has 2 terminals, one marked B+ and
the other marked D.  The B+ obviously goes to the positive side of the
battery, but my question is: Should there be a wire going DIRECTLY from this
terminal to the battery or does the wire from this terminal go to the starter
solenoid where it is attached at the same place as the positive battery cable?

Peace, John Baker
