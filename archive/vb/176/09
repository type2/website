I do have some wiring left from my stripped a while ago Subaru... those seem
to be a little on a smaller size (gauge) than original but I will see if I
can at least match wire colors.... if not, I'll have to visit a junk yard
(was in my plans anyway) to see if I can find any Bay windows.... (splits I
can forget about - not around here, no way) perhaps a type 3? and get some
wires. I'll be on a lookout for a donor engine.... I know how hard it would
be to find a good engine case to build on.....

I'll see if I can just piece these together and then just go over the wiper
switch... I don't want to brake it... I'll have to remove it somehow and see
if I can loosen it up a bit.

peace,

Dre
