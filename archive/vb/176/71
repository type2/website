Subject: RE: [VB] Need a partition for the spare tire.

I just saw a non walkthrough  westy get chopped up here in pa. The lower
edge was slightly rough (where it contacted floor). I could check it out
more this weekend for you.

Somebody hacked out my spare tire well behind my seat. They left most of
the partition in place, just torched out the wheel well for my spare
tire. Does anybody know where i can get one of these to weld back in?
thanks john
