Subject: It likes me, It really likes me!

Hey All,

With a 44 year old vehicle, you wonder about all that has gone before.  I
picked up this 58 SC just two short months ago, and have spent time getting
it in shape.

After putting maybe 150 miles on it last week, commuting to work, running
errands etc, I park katty-whompus in my back lot to unload a bunch of mulch
for the winter garden.  Go to restart when done, to pull into the drive
way...nothing.  Cranks merrily over, and over, and over.  Hmmm.  
Long story short, the coil went south on me, was hot to the touch, and
letting no current pass.  had a spare from my old 71 riviera, popped it on
and Vrooom.

My truck hung in there to break down at HOME!
Always the hallmark of a loyal Volkswagen.....

Wes and (getting closer to named) 58 SC
