Subject: RE: [VB] valve clearance

Hey Stan, I suspect your "hot cam" whatever that grind is, is your reason
for the dead spot. Generally, the valve clearance, unless under .004, will
have no effect on hesitation. 

You are right about the bug DP engines getting the looser valve clearance on
the California carbureted models, then in 74 with all fuel injected. I still
have no problems with .006, since the CA pollution requirements are the
least of my worries.

The original specs were .004 for intake and .006 for exhaust (because the
stem grows). It has been generally accepted for the last 25 years to do
.006
on both intake and exhaust, thus you only have to have one feeler gauge.

My old 66 has a 72 1600 DP with a hot cam and I found notes on the
underside of the engine door that tell me .006 intake and .008 exhaust.
I tried the .006 all the way and it just had a dead spot.
Still runs quiet with these settings.
You might want to look for notes in the back of manuals etc.
I keep notebooks with all my cars and log repairs, specs etc.
Keeps me from forgetting and someday they'll all have confused new
owners.
