  I run a 1800  74X88 cut ins with a custom ground cam (CB Performance),
Auto Linia duel port castings with 40 mm intake and 35.5 exhaust (Manley
valves, silicon high rev springs, chromolly retainers) 6.8 to 1 compression,
CW crankshaft (DPR) SCAT rods, Scat stock rocker assemblies, stock flywheel,
type 3 tight finned oil cooler, Mobil 1 15/50 oil with duel Kadrons (127
main 60 pilot)
  Trans is a Rancho 3.88 with a 1.22 3rd and a 77 4th gear, welded 3/4 th
hub with a super diff (4 spiders). This trans is being changed out as soon
as I get time to install a Rancho with 3.44 r/p, 1.32 3rd and an .89 4th.
This should give me more run out between the gears and a 18% per cent drop
between 3 and 4th instead of the 22% I know have (all numbers are approx
from memory and it's not that crisp anymore)
  With the old (still in) trans I was at 3200 rpm at 60 mph, at 75 I am
turning 3800 and at 50 it felt I was idling.

Ronnie,

What is your engine/tranny combo?  1776?  1835?  2017?  IRS?
