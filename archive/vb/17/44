since you have a deluxe, half the heat goes up to the cab, and half is piped 
to emerge under the rear seat, so the passengers in the back stay warm.  In 
the commercial type 2s - the heat goes into both sides of the Y and goes up 
to the cab.  In the deluxes (and other passenger buses), the capped off one 
side, rather than going to the expense of making another piece there.
