After the third set in six months (bad commutator) I got pretty adept at it.  A mirror and a stubby screwdriver (that _fits_ the screw) is very 
helpful.  taping the screw to the screwdriver makes it easier to put back in.

Of course, I converted to an alternator, so my hard-won skill is for naught.

Problem is, the time it takes to remove and replace a generator is worth more than the value of that "free" generator.  I'd rather put in a 
good unit once than a series of poorly-rebuilt units.

Gee, brushes cost $7 a set.  Why keep half-worn-out ones around?

I've had one starter in my bus the entire time I've owned it.  Same goes for my wife's bug.  Both have a "Bosch Remanufactured" label. 
Thank goodness the PO of both vehicles went for the good stuff.  Again, it's better to pay once for quality than return a succession of 
"lifetime guaranteed" units.
