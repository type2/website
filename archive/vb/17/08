  Yea Mark you caught me on the "swamp cooler", as hot as it gets here I'm
going to install it in the engine bay and worry about an engine later!
  And yes Karl this could(?) be the "Jerome Raffle Bus", all proceeds would
go to me, so I could get a good divorce lawyer because of getting rid of the
Westy,
OH, by the way the tickets are $5000 per, minimum four per person.
  Thanks guys for the kind words, as slow as I am working on it, it'll be
running next year!
