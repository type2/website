Subject: want to buy child's cot

Hello,

We are in need of a child's for our 1967 split screen  bus. In fact 
we need the whole enchilada: poles, fabric, clips for the hanger. If 
you have the stuff and would like to sell it at a reasonable price 
please contact us.

While we are at it, if anyone has an SO42 interior cluttering up 
their garage and wants to sell it let us know.
