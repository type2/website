Subject: Re: [VB] removing gen brushes I need help


Brushes on the gen while in the bus are a pain in the arse. Remeber they are 
on the top and the bottom. I have had brushes that werent made very well and 
were too thick to drop down as the spring pushed on them.

The way I delt with it was this:
I bought a guaranteed generator. Some of you wont like that plan and its 
understandable, the FLAPS sell these as remanufactured units, and what that 
means, is that some electronics student from Arizona or whereever rebuilt 
it.

However, and its a big however, is that I dont replace brushes. Ever. I 
replace the whole unit when it doesnt work. I always take the brushes out 
when I return the gen, and now I have a small pile of them. They are spares.

I figure that yes it is annoying to take out the gen and return it, but hey 
I would have to take it out anyway to put in them brushes.

I have replaced brushes using a mirror on other folks busses but its such a 
pain in the arse I dont do it on my Bus. (or the 7 or 8 busses I have 
owned).

One time purchase = lifetime bus fun, no matter how many you own.


BTW: After 7 lifetime starters (different concept bear with me) they are 
getting annoyed at my returns, but in the end if they wont replace it they 
will give me my money back. Heh.
