Hi,

In the South, everybody passes everybody. On a recent trip to Florida, I was
surprised how many people tailgated or cut me off in Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama and Florida. In Texas, you DO NOT do that (speaking of gun racks).

That was in a Volvo.

I've noticed this same phenomena. The faster you go, the faster they go.
Their goal is get ahead of you, and you make it harder by going faster.

I guess going slow and letting people pass you will make many people happy.
Maybe this is why people who drive VWs have good karma.
