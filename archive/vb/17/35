Subject: Gas Geyser Repost

I posted this before, but no one responded (at least in time for it to be on
the server still). So I'll try again...

Can someone tell me why my bus just shoots gas out the filler neck? We're
talking with great force, not a "leak" dribble.

Understandably for those of us who don't want to be incinerated in a gas
explosion, but would -- per chance -- rather continue to drive the byways
via a good ol' VW bus, I'd like to get this situation corrected.

The conundrum is, I can't seem to replicate the same result (i.e, same
amount [i.e., from full to 3/4, not below] of gas in the tank, angle that
the bus is parked at, VARIOUS angles the bus is parked at, same ambient
temperature, different ambient temperature.. there is no consistent pattern
yet defined).

It varies. It's always a surprise.

I had the gas tank itself checked out by a professional and he opined that
the gas tank was fine.

Any insights appreciated.

Craig
