Subject: Re: [VB] Fitting my bus in my garage

Hi Stewart...
Well, maybe I'm just a simple gal, but
I would let the air out enough to get the bus into the garage....why
not?
Also, we have had luck with a 2x4 on each side of the raised garage
door...pushing up on it just enough to clear the bus...sounds like you
don't have that far to go.
Good luck,
Susan
