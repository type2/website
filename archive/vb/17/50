In what year did they switch from screw-on terminals to push-on terminals? 
I'm trying to figure out which is the right lighting switch for my '59.  I
have one of each.  The biggest difference, besides terminals, is that the
push-on type adds a #57 terminal to the switch, where the screw-on type
doesn't have that.
