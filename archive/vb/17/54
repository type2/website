Subject: Please send me your photos from BNNTA

Just to let all listees know that got back from Buses Nowhere Near the Arch
#17, I'd like to have you forward your photos to me.  I'd prefer them zipped
but if you do not know how to do this, I'll take them in plain file by file
format.  I'd like to get some good photos put together for next year's
website (with your permission.)  Please specify if you wish them NOT to be
put in the selection pool.

Erin
