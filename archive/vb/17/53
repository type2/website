Subject: Oktoberbus 2001 North Carolina

It is time for everyone to plan a fall trip to North Carolina. There will be
plenty of fun and relaxation at a great location in western NC. A good time
is always had by all that attend. There is a rumor that we will be sharing
the grounds with a rather interesting group of individuals that have nothing
to do with busses, but will be fun to interact with. One year the Boy Scout
jamboree was there, and two years ago we got to visit the Yesheads! Be
assured that we have our own private "out of sight" area so you have to see
no one other than bus people if you choose! Remember to keep driving down
and to the back into the woods to find us.

This not an official full moon event, but all the members show up!
