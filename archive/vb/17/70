the body should have grey rubber all the way around.  The door has a rubber 
seal fitted into the channel of the window frame.  what kind of weather 
stripping did you get?  I really liked the fit of the WCM grey rubber kits 
for the front doors.  make sure the orientation of each piece is correct.  
differnet channels are supposed to take a differnet profile of the grey 
rubber.

 ya, just did this on my 61, the rear cargo door was slightly bent, undo the 
4 machine screw with the large phillips head- impact is good.  I went at it, 
then soaked with penetrating oil, and waited.  actually undid them a week or 
so later.  Impact with hammer a few times, then the ratchet on the large 
phillps impact bit .  with all slightly loose, you can wiggle the door 
around.   But you should not have to.  maybe you got an extra piece in 
doubled up?     maybe the check rods are worn?  often the check rod catch on 
the body is worn.   The bottom one for my forward cargo door is worn through, 
and careful bending and placement of a generator shim does not seem to work 
as a permanent fix, so a little judicious welding and it should be great if I 
don't blast holes through the rusty metal.    Need more film.  Aha.
