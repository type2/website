Subject: all these tubes and wires...

I'm no electrical genius, I'm the first to admit it!  Although I like
listening to the sounds my bus'es engine makes, I'd also like to hear its
radio.  So here's what I've found:

This is for a 1970 Westfalia
I have a big black wire/coaxial deal going to the antennae
There is a blue wire coming out of the radio to / toward the right most fuse
There is a black wire, with an inline fuse holder, also going to / toward
the right most fuse
A pair of brown wires also come out of the radio, one each, male & female
spade connectors.

Does this seem right?  Right now there is no power to the radio.  I'm
ASSuming it's because there's no fuse in the inline fuse dealie.  This
appears to be a stock radio, however, judging from some of the other
electrical "fixes" on the bus there is no guarantee.  I bought a speaker
today as none was present, though I'm not sure what rating of fuse would go
in the inline fuse holder.  I hope to try to get this thing working
tomorrow.  Any guidance would be appreciated.

ON ANOTHER NOTE, I was at a couple U-Pull it yards today, no finds, but next
door to one of them was German Auto Wrecking.  Looking thru the fence I
noticed a late 60's, early 70's westy with the upper shelf / cabinet above
the z-bed in the back so I stopped & inquired about the price... $100.00 !!
no wonder it looked like it had been sitting there awhile!

Thanks for the help,

Dave
