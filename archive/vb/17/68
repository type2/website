they changed from the screw connectors to the push ons 1 june 1960, ch 614 
456.

57 is ther terminal for the little driving lights in the headlights.  my euro 
spec 62 wiring diagram does not have 57 on the headlight switch, but the us 
spec one does.

ditto for the 3/55 through may 60 wiring diagram- US headlight buses want the 
switch with terminal 57 to make those front lights work.

If youare using euro headlights, you can use a us spec switch and ignore 
terminal 57
