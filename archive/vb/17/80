Oops.

I replied to a T2 thread on the splitty list, $189 for bay glass is about
right or maybe $30 higher... 

and on a bay, I probably would spring for PPG or german glass as it is
a curved windshield and the wrong curve could make installation difficult
and cracks develop later on, if not when you try to put it in!

but, I still think tempered windscreen glass is E-vil.

take care,

Steve
