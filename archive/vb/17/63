Subject: FS empi polished 5 spokes goodyear eagles

Hello list members. I posted a couple of weeks ago about my
lowered bus rubbing up front when I had it loaded.  My only two
option were to raise it or change wheel and tire package. I dont
 have the time or all the parts needed to raise it so I opted for the tire
swap.
So I have for sale Aset of 5 spoke polished empi`s and Goodyear Eagle Gps
195/60r15 radials, with all hardware. The tires have 3,000 miles on them.
 They are like brand new. I want 450.00 for them or will trade for a nice
full length roof rack.
I am located in Delaware.
Thanks,
Dave Parsons
