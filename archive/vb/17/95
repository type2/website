Subject: HELP, Long Shot

   I just got a call from a fellow who is in need of a 56 tail light lens
and/or lens and bexal. He was helping a friend and dropped one and broke it
and now needs to replace it. He feels like shit and I have used all my
resources trying to find 1 LENS for him. If anybody out there can help,
please contact me.
  It's a HELLA bubble lens SBL 17

thanks  ronnie
