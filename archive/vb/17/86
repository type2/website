Thor,
Doing this now to a 66. Answer is depends how it was lowered.
You could still have rgbs? Then the spring plates were most likely just
reindexed, OR you could have a TI swing axle conversion, meaning buying the
orginal trans/RGBs/Srping plates, OR IRS conversions are adjustable via adj
spring plates to a stockish height. (I think)
Up front, perhaps lowered spindles>? Replace with stock.
Screwed up front springs? New springs or beam..
Adjustable front beam, adjust to stock height (bus boys, can this be done?)
So, what you need to do is assess how it was done.
I had to get an entire tii rear box to box, buy the right brakes (mine had
tIII), new fornt spindles, the right spring plates, new tie rod ends, and
rear brake line sto do it right. Still assembling all this...

I bought a 1967 VW Bus that is lowered. I want to raise it back to the
original height. How is this done? Does anyone in the Southern Ca. area Know
of a company that can do this for me? Thanks
