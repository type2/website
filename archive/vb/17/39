Subject: Engines out, what else?

So, I'm pullin out the motors on both the busses, on the 71 I'm replacing
the generator and starter, and on the 65, I'm pullin just because i want to
know what's what.   Living in New England, I have a long winter to mess
around.  I've kicked around getting the bug me videos.  The 71 has a 1600
Dp, the 65 has a dual Kadron setup, with no air filters that backfires :).
Both engines and trannies are smooth, but what else should I do while I have
them out (again)?   I'm  working hard to be the most needy and and
incompetent person on this (these) list(s)....see Pulverized generator.
