Subject: Phoenix Bumper Straightener? 

Dan,
Papago Plating on 24thSt. and E. Washington St. did
the ones on the '67 camper. Had to take them back
three times and the STILL didnt get them right! Had to
spend time filling and filing with "All-metal" putty
to finish them. Total PITA. Of course couldnt
powdercoat them with the putty in them.
I would have recommended Mesa Metro.

Go ahead and try Papago if you want but tell the
morons that you want them f**king perfect enough for
chroming but not to chrome them. I found them to be
condescending unprofessional morons who didn't give a
sh*t.

Search the archives as this Phoenix based subject has
been discussed at length before. I recommend dry
fitting all of the pieces <assemble it all> prior to
priming and painting or especially powdercoating.
TRUST ME on this! You might find a need to clearence
the repop upright over-rider pieces. "Straightening"
the bumpers might result in non-stock
curvature/angles. <not joking>
Good luck.
