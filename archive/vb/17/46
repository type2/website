I have seen gun racks on  a couple splitty SC in the PNW.   There was one 
truck, a 62 or something, bright orange paint on the dash, a bit rusty, a bit 
dented, gun rack, cut wheel wells, FS, I wanted it, but no title and the guy 
selling it was a jerk.  
My friend Rick has a gun rack in his Chevy truck, which he uses mostly for 
holding levels (he works construction).  So you can also call them level- 
racks.
