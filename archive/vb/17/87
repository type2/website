  Really, I'd just let enough air out of the tires to get it in. Then take 
the wheels off if you don't have enough room to air them back up. You're 
right the dollies are very expensive.
  What size rims do you have? 15"? You could try to find a set of 14" rims 
and find some cheap used tires to put on them that have a lower profile. 
That way you could still move the bus around easy enough.
