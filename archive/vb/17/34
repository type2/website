What a great idea!

This particular splittie driver used his vacation and worked intimately over
various years providing supplemental medical triage and CFR (crash / fire /
rescue) communications as an amateur
(ham) radio operator on the flight line every year for about 10 years
(...not bad for a "commie hippie pinko," as the phrase went and still
sometimes goes, eh) -- until I no longer had the opportunity to do so in
that capacity.

Having no interest
in instead languishing in the bleachers as a program-grasping ticket buyer
(as much, far much more is happening than the spectator ever experiences), I
haven't been back since to the event I loved most about the Reno area, since
the participatory aspect and the public safety aspect I had excelled at was
supplanted by other concerns.

But a bus event... hmmm!

My questions are: where would you have the bus'es convene (as it's pretty
congested on-site re parking)?

Would this gathering, then, be held residentially?

And by "flight path," do you mean west of the runway (Silver Knolls area) or
east (Lemmon Valley)?

If there's not time to get this thing together for this year (races start in
just a little over a week from now), there's plenty of time for people to
schedule time off for next year, and I would most assuredly be one of them.

As I've said, I haven't been out there for a while, only because I really
couldn't stomach just being a spectator after being in the thick of things
for some time.

But being a spectator among fellow splittie drivers, that'd be different!

Thanks. This is a really cool idea.
