Hiya Dave,

OK, here's the deal on 1970 stock radios................  All of them were 
installed at the dealer as an option.  Extra bucks for the dealer.  Most were 
Sapphires.  Appropriate models for your 70 would be a Sapphire XI (am only) 
or a Sapphire XII (am-fm).  Interestingly dealers also offered an upgrade to 
Blaupunkt.  Interesting because a Sapphire nowadays is usually worth more 
than its Blaupunkt counterpart (unless you get to older models or the 
Blaupunkt city series of radios).

When originally installed by the dealer the wiring coming from the radio 
(assuming it's a Sapphire) would be very close to what you described.  The 
doubled brown lead with the spade connectors is the lead to the speaker.  The 
blue lead is your internal light in the radio.  Actually, that should lead 
out to the headlight switch.  And the black lead is your power source.  An 8 
amp fuse in that holder will do the job for you.

I have lotsa radio parts if you need anything and I'm just a holler and a 
jump away from you.

Good luck!

Mike
