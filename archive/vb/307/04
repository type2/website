Subject: '59 Single Cab... shift rod clean!

Ronnie suggested I go back at my shift rod tube with the old clutch 
cable. He said his Aussie bus was REALLY bad and that it worked on 
that, so should work on mine. He also suggested that I bend the cable 
in half to make a loop and fray half the strands...roto rooter it!

So...that's what I did. And it worked! I kept at it and was able to 
work on the specific trouble spots. One thing is that I used my drill 
in reverse and the cable seemed to like that better. Took about an 
hour to get the job done. So I'm calling it a success and stopping 
for tonight.

I'll need to clean the tube out real good and maybe get some rust 
converter or something in there I guess.

Man, this shift rod thing has been a major unexpected problem on this 
truck. Glad it's mostly behind me now. Thanks a ton to Ronnie for the 
"el cheapo" problem solver. Thanks also to Greg S. in Elgin for 
letting me get the shift rod off the rotting panel bus in his 
backyard. Now I can get on with converting my front tranny mount and 
installing this Rancho Freeway Flyer tranny.
