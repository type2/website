Subject: Speedo beauty ring

Upon sending it a couple of weeks ago, I proptly lost the name and adress of 
the person in NC I sent a speedo beauty ring to.  I got a confirmation from 
Jim James who I sent some thermostat hardware to, enjoy and godspeed, but am 
curious as to whether the speedo ring arrived.
