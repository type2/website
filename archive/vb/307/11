Subject: Re: [VB] Camper Panels/Over Driver & Passenger?

I've started reproing interior panels for splitties.   The original panels 
were metric sized, so 1/8" thickness on the cab roof doesn't fit right and has 
to be thinned down. And 1/8" is a bit too big for the groove on the air vent. 
The outside should be the right shape, as a bit bigger will make it really hard 
to fit.  You have to push up in the middle of the panel when installing them 
to make the panel bend, as it has to have a curve in it to fit.    Hope this 
helps.

What material does everyone use to make the panels that go over your head in a
Westy?  I've started making them out of the brown Hardboard (1/8 thick) from
Lowes.  This still doesn't seem flexible enough.  I've broke one piece already
trying to get it to fit.
