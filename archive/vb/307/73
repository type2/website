Subject: RE: [VB] Early bay front emblem?

I used to have a 230 Mercedes that lost three of it's $25 emblems before
I rigged up a 4000 volt pulser circuit and isolated the emblem on nylon
pads and a nylon spring cover tube. Only had one kid in the neighborhood
try and take it and the word got around.

Don't think I haven't considered it.  A few hundred volts would do
nicely.  I wonder what the breakdown voltage of those little plastic
inserts is?
