Subject: PST Monthly Meeting Wednesday night

While I am in a posting frenzy I want to invite any bus
enthusiasts in the Atlanta area to come to Peach State
Transporters monthly meeting at Mellow Mushroom Pizza in
downtown Decatur Wednesday night at 7pm.

If you are in our area but are not aware of us, we get
together the 1st Wednesday of the month and have pizza
and a beer.  In the summer we get together once a month
for drive-in movies.  We do 3 or 4 organized campouts a
year and we caravan to shows in GA and the surrounding
states.

We have a website at http://www.peachstatetransporters.com
but as far as I know it has not been updated recently...

You can find directions to the Decatur Mellow Mushroom at
