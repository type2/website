Subject: Heads up 34 pict 3

  I was just informed by one of my importers (when ordering) that the 34
pict 3's might become obsolete. There has allready been a substantal price
increase . This could be rumor or truth but checking with other importers I
believe it's true as they have all raised there prices by 25% or more.  So
if you where thinking of a new carb I would hunt down the lowest price and
get one before the vendors catch up with the new pricing, I am currentley
selling thm on special order only as my current inventory of 34 pict 3 is
sold out (I had them priced to low I guess)
