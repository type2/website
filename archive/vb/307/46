Subject: CSP disc kits on slotted wheels ?

Just wondered if anyone had fitted a CSP front disc kit and 15" bus rims 
combination ??

In fact I'm hearing stories of two styles of 15" slotted rims one with a 
deep (from outer side of rim inwards) pressed section and one with a 
shallow pressed section.  ??
