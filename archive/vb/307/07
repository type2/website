Subject: Starter adaptor to run engine on stand

Anyone know where I can get a starter adaptor to bolt on the right side of
my engine so I can run it on the engine stand before I install it? Thought I
saw one in a magazine recently but can't seem to find it.

I have an ancient one made from a VW magnesium trans case but it interferes
with the flywheel on my 70 engine.

Thanks,
