Subject: Re: [VB] turn signal switch slips down steering collumn

Rob,

Similar situation with my Father-in-law's '67 bus.  We've heard a couple of
solutions and I am sure there are more elegant ones, but here are the two I
know of...
1. Take off the switch.  File down the part of the housing where it touches
the other side.  Reducing the pinch between the two parts you are screwing
together.  Put it back on and blinker to your heart's content.
2. Take a cola (or beer) can of your choice, cut off the top and bottom so
you get a nice rectangular (but sharp, caution) sheet of metal.  Remove the
switch or open it enough to slide easily.  Wrap your steering column with
the aluminum from the can.  Slide the switch back up over the now 'thicker'
steering column.  Tighten.  Blinker to your heart's content.

Another hint is to make sure you have bolts in good condition.  Ours were
pretty trashed from several failed events at tightening them way to much.
If the head is trashed it will be hard to tighten and the bolt itself may be
bent.  Plus it looks like doo doo in a visible spot.

Good luck.
