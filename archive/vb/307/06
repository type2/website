That is kind of funny... or not actually.

I hold no opinion on the matter other than having to pay for the work to put
my SP back in working order.   I just thought this was interesting that the
opinion of the really smart people on this list fit right in with my
experience.  It's always nice to correlate with the experts.

Two people respond with similar comments on Gex.  I have one to add now.  I
bought a '63 bus this last summer that came with a SP engine.  It didn't
make the trip home for several reasons... long story told short, I fiddled
and fiddled and never got the SP to work properly.  I recently took it in
for a rebuild assessment.  He tore into it and found the following;  The
engine had been put together by Gex and it was completely wrong.  Unbalanced
shims, completely wrong drive shaft measurements and numerous other things
that are apparently pretty basic when building or rebuilding an engine.  The
mechanic (although somewhat of a pessimist already) had no idea how the
engine ran in the first place.  It had a lot of good reasons not to run.

So, yet another testament to the vendor's product.

The SP works wonderfully now by the way...

To the list experts.  Thank you for your continued sharing of knowledge.  My
freshmen year of bus ownership has been greatly improved because of your
help.
