Subject: Everybus 2004 Kid's Activities

Hi Folks,

I have been appointed the Kid's Activities Czar by Chris.  Since Everybus
has become such a family oriented campout, we wanted to do something special
for the kids (and parents to keep the kids busy ;0). If anyone would like to
offer their help on Saturday that would be great.  We have a couple of ideas
floating around and would like your input.  I not only want entertain the
3-10 age group but also the older kids.  If you have any ideas to suggest,
please do.  It would help tremendously if we could get an idea of the number
and ages of the children attending.  Please send
EB2004KidsActivities(-at-)kookymathteacher.com .  We hope this will be the best
Every Bus yet

 

Joy Thru Air,

Jamie Auch
