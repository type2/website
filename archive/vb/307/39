Subject: Re: [VB] Beetle tranny on reduction boxes ?

In my 63 Deluxe when I upgraded the engine to a 1904, I chose to do the
same thing. I went with the super beetle tranny made for the first three
months of production before they swiched to IRS. I also had Gerry Zink
upgrade 4th gear to one out of a 79 bus. the combo now with stock 63 RD
boxes in place gives me 70 MPH at 2700 RPM.  I also can cruse over the
I-90 pass at 65 MPH with three people and camping gear.
