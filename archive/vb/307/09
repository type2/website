Subject: Camper Panels/Over Driver & Passenger?

What material does everyone use to make the panels that go over your head in a
Westy?  I've started making them out of the brown Hardboard (1/8 thick) from
Lowes.  This still doesn't seem flexible enough.  I've broke one piece already
trying to get it to fit.
