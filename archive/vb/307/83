Subject: [Fwd: Re: [VB] Early bay front emblem?]

es George, I believe I do have an early bay front emblem hanging in my 
garage.  And as luck would have it I need a splitty emblem!  If you are 
interested, I can take some pictures of it to confirm it is the correct 
one.  We could just trade?  Are you interested?

Thanks-
Jim
