Subject: Re: [VB] Beetle tranny on reduction boxes ?

the center section is the same in bus.bug.ghia swing axle trannies... except 
buggs have a lower 4th gear.  and buses ring gear is flipped around for 
RGears.  different r&ps at dif times. You can take the side plates off, count the 
ring gear teeth, and (for tunnel case) divide by the 8 splines on the pinion 
shaft so 33 ring gear teeth / 8 on pinion = 4.125 ratio
  I take it you want to put a higher geared tranny in your 57?  

Guess you'll have to use a tunnel case tranny though, which means buying or 
making an adaptor so it'll bolt on the nose cone.   and it won't look stock 
from under neath.   so to fool the casual eye you'ld need to do the 63 1 ton 
thing, which would definately increase your gearing.  ie rpms at 50mph w/ 1.4redux 
will give you 55mph at 1.26 redux

 '63 1 ton rear spindles and drums  have the 1.26 RGs and the 1 ton brakes, 
but use the early RGBoxes and bearings and the small axle nut, so look stock 
for 57 from the outside.

they use the 1 ton (ie 64-67) brake shoes and backing plates

I read that it is possible to get a later swing axle beetle tranny

read up on parts needed etc. ?

Reason is that I wanta bolt-on upgrade with the best possible ratios in 
the tranny, but retain the original ride height and rear brake setup so 
the bus still looks stock from the outside and underneath.
