Subject: Turn signal switch

I have 67 bus and my turn signal switch is loose. I have tightened the
screws as tight as they will go but there is still considerable play. Any
suggestions on how to get the switch tight without stripping the screws and
holes? Any tricks you experienced guys and gals may have would be greatly
appreciated.

Thank you,
