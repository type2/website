Subject: RE: [VB] New items and interest

  What I am going to do is carefully remove the complete brake lines from a
bus to see which areas can and cannot be pre bent. I know it is difficult to
replace some of the lines if they are pre bent, but some can be. Thats why
it is a couple weeks away if there is an interest. I am going to have the
front brake inner lines made and the rgb lines made regardlees and if worse
comes to worse I will have line kits (not bent) also made in stainless. I
allready have complete German soft metal line kits in stock, but stainless
would last a lifetime.
  That is why I put out a message of interst to see what, when and how.

Possible stupid question, how do you install pre-bent brake lines when the
brake lines go through the frame in some places?

It sure looks like a bunch of my brakes lines would need to be bent in place
during the install process.
