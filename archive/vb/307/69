Hi All -

Though this new low compression stroker motor is installed in my '71 van, 
the design decisions and performance expectations will be very similar for 
RGB equipped Type II's.

I wanted to keep up with traffic on the Interstates, get 20 mpg, burn 
regular, run cool and, as it turned out, was willing to spend $4,000 or so 
to do it.
