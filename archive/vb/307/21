Subject: Beetle tranny on reduction boxes ?

I read that it is possible to get a later swing axle beetle tranny 
runnign with reduction box axles - anyone done this or know where I can 
read up on parts needed etc. ?

Reason is that I wanta bolt-on upgrade with the best possible ratios in 
the tranny, but retain the original ride height and rear brake setup so 
the bus still looks stock from the outside and underneath.
