Subject: [VB] My Sons driving the '63 camper Bus

The partially completed 6 year project... My Son started driving it last
week. It's hard watching my baby drive away(the bus). I've worked on every
part of it (except the front end I've still got the 64-67 front beam swap to
go)and redo the interior. I'm already looking on the SAMBA at pre '63s for
sale  the drive way just doesn't look right without a old bus in it.. Thanks
Vintage bus list for all the help in the last 6 years . At least if I stall
on the work ( nothing new)I can keep it around for another 6 months..  Lloyd
