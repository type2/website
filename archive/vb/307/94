OBC... havent driven the SC in a few weeks now...oh
its still turn key, but got ran off the road kinda
24th of Jan... little girl in dads car w/cell phone in
ear turns right in front of me.... I was rollin bout
50mph.... think fast.... I rip the wheel to the right,
just missing her front end... well the (-at-)ss end breaks
loose, and heads me right towards the BIG curb....
brace for impact..... shoot, it launched the truck a
few feet in the air... well, when everything came to a
stop, the truck had lf flat w/severe bent rim, broke
key in the ign, sumhow it broke the driver side upper
door hinge, steering wheel bout 1/4 turn out, ashtray
cut on head, and liquid refreshment dripping from the
headliner.... (I had just stopped at the store, was
heading to a friends)...
She was totally freaked.... no... dont worry bout
callin the cops.... not that much damage done. (and
was covered in liquid refreshment) Oh well... only
real damage was to the lf brake... old truck shutters
pretty bad, mabey bent hub...
