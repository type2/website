Forwarded from me, from Clark (contact Clark):


 If you need an emblem I found one on a 71. I have my spare mounted up front and can't use it. The guy wanted $25 for it. I'll pull it off and send it to you for $25 and exact cost of shipping. I don't know what they go for, so this may or may not be a good deal. The one I'm referring to is the one on the nose, about 10 inches or so in diameter.
