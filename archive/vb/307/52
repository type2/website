Subject: Re: [VB] bad day . . . bus broken

Ah! the utility of the daily driver. How inconvenient! Nice to have a garage
to put it all into and deal with some other time? reminds me of my problems
too. Changed the oil in the 57 van. Noticed a little oil drip on left side.
Ya, it turns out to look a lot like oil cooler. Oh boy, get to pull engine,
etc. I may try to wait for a few weeks or more to get my other engine built
up then just do a swap. That was the reason I wanted an extra engine anyway.
Guess I'll just limit it to driving around town and keep close eye on the
oil leak and level. I'll use the 65 bus as the primary vehicle too. I use
cardboard on the gravel sloping driveway under one of those car tents to
keep it a little drier.
