Subject: ! Wheeled trailers??

Anyone have a source for info on I wheeled trailers.  S friend if giving me
one that was towed behind a Beetle at one time or enougher.  Says it needs
some work.  So I'm looking for idea of what they look like and parts available
to fix.

Anyone have one and have pics of it/
