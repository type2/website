Pfft! It was not Mr. Special-K but a definite clone driving a clone bus

It's happened to the best of us. I actually saw "the real" Craig K out in 
the middle of west TX one time. I was between Eden and Brady (small towns 
in the middle of a big nowhere) and was figuring the backed up traffic was 
because of an old farmer in his truck or something. When we finally got to 
the front for our turn to pass...I was amazed to see it was a familiar 
looking Fat Chick. I pull up to the side and sure enough there was "the 
radical in hippie's clothing" himself driving. He looked a little stressed 
and it seemed he didn't want to look over for fear of getting the finger 
and a "go home hippie!" yelled at him. When he finally looked he saw me, my 
wife, and the crew of kids smiling at him from the mini-van we were in. We 
all pulled over and I got a picture of him and his brand new bride on the 
side of the road. Very odd chance meeting of someone you know.

p.s. Ba Ba Booey!
