Subject: PLF Dawn's Reduction Box (longish)

On the way to OCTO, PLF Dawn's reduction box cracked.
I saw the remnants at OCTO, and asker her how and what
happened. She didn't really know, but said none of the
bearings came apart. She did mention that she "topped
off" the gear oil the day before and did some brake
work, and nothing else looked bad.
To me, it looked like another reduction box I saw that
a bearing shot a ball through the gear teeth and out
the side of the casing: progressively smaller chunks
taken out of the gear teeth on the axle and upper
gear. She told me that no bearings were damaged. 
There were some hefty chunks taken out of both gears
and it looked like they passed through some gear teeth
before "exiting" through the massive crack on the side
of the outer reduction box half.
So my question is: if this was not caused by a ball
from a bearing, then what? There isn't anything else
inside other than the spring clip on the upper axle. 
My only other thought was that too much oil may have
caused a seal to leak, the gear oil ran out, and then
the heat generated by no oil caused metal fatigue of
the gear teeth, causing them to chip/fracture.
Other than that, I can't think of anything, and it's
been bothering me for a couple days now.
Anyone else have an opinion?
