I think the production date is not the same as the delivery date, and there 
tends to be some time between production being done and delivery happening.    
The dklivery date for my 53 is about 3 weeks after the production date, and it 
was sold in Amsterdam, you could WALK there in 3 weeks from WOlfsberg.  So I 
think it sat around for a while before they sent it out.

Now if someone is REALLY bored and feels like collecting data, they could 
gets lists of deleivery dates and destinations, so you could see which other 
buses were sent with yours to that port.  It would be like classmates, who 
graduated from the factory with your bus?.  You could try to organise a reunion. 

ya, right
