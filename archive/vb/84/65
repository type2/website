Subject: Re: [VB] Math conversion (cc to liter)

The connection between linear, mass and volume measure in the metric
system is rather nice.  A liter is a cubic decimeter, or 10cm x 10cm x
10cm.  There are therefore 1000 cm^3 in a liter.

A liter of water has a mass of 1.0kg, which ties the fundimental units
together rather neatly.  Take the capacity of a fuel tank in liters and
multiply by the specific gravity of the contents to get the mass of
the contents.

Try that with the US/Liberian system!
