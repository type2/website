JB Weld will work for a short period of time, but is NOT resistant to fuel
and oil. It will break down, if you haven't already noticed and you will
have the same leak back again. Read the information on the packet the two
tubes came in. Also, it wont work around the heads for very long because of
the hi/lo temp diferential. Works great fo obscure block cracks though!

i had this same problem with a new h30/31 brosol.  it took me a while to
find the leak, but i took out the front (fif) stud that bolts to the
manifold and up in there was a very slight crack up in it right below where
the main jet passage would be.  i called the dude i bought it from and
complained.  i got it for half price then and carefully fixed it with some
jb weld.  works great!  i cant say this is your problem, but something to
look for.
