Hi Thomas,
Both Clara and we have done the type 4 converison into a doghouse shroud.  
Both have simular oil temp drops of about 10F.  Ronnine was going to do some 
gauged testing between the doghouse cooler and the type 3 cooler, but we 
never heard the outcome.  We believe the type 4 cooler is better due to 
having larger air passages through them.  Which allows the cooling air going 
through the type 4 cooler to expand and cool the oil better than being 
stuffed through the smaller type 3 passages with apparently same surface area 
as the type 4.
We also posed the question if the type 3 cooler was as good or superior why 
did VW not use it on the later type 4?  VW was very stingy about outlay for 
tooling to make parts unless there was a worthwhile improvement in 
performance and the type 4 was out and about long enough to field test this.  
This was even more paramount when in the 1970s to keep up with pollution laws 
the ACVW engine was under more and more heat stress due to leaner and leaner 
mixtures to pass emissions.
  Make sure to use a 34mm or better yet 35mm wide (Inside measurement) 
cooling fan on any type of doghouse shroud.
