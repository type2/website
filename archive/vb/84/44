i had this same problem with a new h30/31 brosol.  it took me a while to
find the leak, but i took out the front (fif) stud that bolts to the
manifold and up in there was a very slight crack up in it right below where
the main jet passage would be.  i called the dude i bought it from and
complained.  i got it for half price then and carefully fixed it with some
jb weld.  works great!  i cant say this is your problem, but something to
look for.
