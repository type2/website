Subject: Carb leak assistance please, at base. More jets. Qs


After I park, after a run, I notice gas seeping from carb base, at
manifold gasket. I am of course replacing the gasket. Should this be the
only issue, however? The leak stops after a short while, and is dry the
next morning. I am assuming the motor is heating, and the leak begins
after gas is no longer being sucked into the motor. I blamed a loose
idle cut off intially, which I replaced with teflon to achieve tightness
and eliminate leaks of vaccum or gas, this is not the area. I am also
good at all bushings/shafts, top seal, acc pump, and jets.
Gonna get preheat working this weekend, hoping to get those cold day
warmups better.

I am still too cold with my jet setup. I don't even get the flaps all
the way open, with a properly adjusted t stat.
I have a pict 30/31 brosol with the stock jets. I think I need a 120 or
117.5, and a 50-50 pilot/aux set up. Can anyone explain the additional
jets, and how I should begin with setting up this carb? Bentley and
Solex manual don't seem to fully apply, as I have an extra variable I
need to address. Should one always sbe larger by some degree that the
other? Aux vs. Pilot?
What do the letters, like g, mean on jets?


On a watercooled note, we just picked up a 1999 weekender for winter
camping and as the woman of the house's daily driver. She's loving it
already. I know I won't be touching that scary drivetrain....Ever....
I'll never switch from my split, but it seems a nice car, does 80
easily.
