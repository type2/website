It's a tapered thread.  I was pretty sure it was a metric thread,
but a couple of posts in the type2 archive claim it is a 1/8" NPT
(National Pipe Taper) thread.

Apparently the sender on a type 4 case and the oil-cooler mounted
sender on a type 3 use regular square threads and a crush washer
for sealing.
