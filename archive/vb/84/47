Al-
1600sp, right? Try this: Pilot 65, Aux 45, Mains 115. Individual carbs
and engines may vary, but I bet that is pretty close.
The 30/31 is not an old carb, so the old manuals don't give you the
right numbers, but the general ideas are the same. Think of it as a
34PICT scaled down to 30PICT size.
My theories:
Mains should be as small as you can get away with without being to
lean at the high rpms.
Pilot should be sized to give you the best range of adjustment with
the mixture screw on the carb.
Aux seems to be 2/3 to 3/4 of pilot, you just have to listen for it
being about right in the midrange rpms. Too lean is easier to hear
than too rich.
When first got my 30/31 I installed it right out of the box, with a
120 mains, I think. My bus always inclined towards stalling when cold.
Since using a smaller mains (currently on 112.5 but I think I should
go to 115) the stalling is a thing of the past and the engine is
generally a bit livelier. I feel like I've knocked a little off my top
speed, but my steering box is lousy so the bus isn't any good above 60
anyway.
Good luck and patience.

After I park, after a run, I notice gas seeping from carb base, at
manifold gasket. I am of course replacing the gasket. Should this be
the
only issue, however? The leak stops after a short while, and is dry
the
next morning. I am assuming the motor is heating, and the leak begins
after gas is no longer being sucked into the motor. I blamed a loose
idle cut off intially, which I replaced with teflon to achieve
tightness
and eliminate leaks of vaccum or gas, this is not the area. I am also
good at all bushings/shafts, top seal, acc pump, and jets.
Gonna get preheat working this weekend, hoping to get those cold day
warmups better.

I am still too cold with my jet setup. I don't even get the flaps all
the way open, with a properly adjusted t stat.
I have a pict 30/31 brosol with the stock jets. I think I need a 120
or
117.5, and a 50-50 pilot/aux set up. Can anyone explain the additional
jets, and how I should begin with setting up this carb? Bentley and
Solex manual don't seem to fully apply, as I have an extra variable I
need to address. Should one always sbe larger by some degree that the
other? Aux vs. Pilot?
What do the letters, like g, mean on jets?


On a watercooled note, we just picked up a 1999 weekender for winter
camping and as the woman of the house's daily driver. She's loving it
already. I know I won't be touching that scary drivetrain....Ever....
I'll never switch from my split, but it seems a nice car, does 80
easily.
