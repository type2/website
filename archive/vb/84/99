Sorry, but that is what I had to remove in order to get the extractor onto
the drag link. I messed it up myself, and I corrected it. Still a daily
driver guys.

Ray,

If you did that to adjust your steering wheel, you jumped in with that frog.

Don't move the arm on the shaft. That will make it so you have a different
number of turns to lock in each direction. The arm and shaft have marks that
should line up. The way to center the wheel is to remove the drag link from
the arm, center the wheels, center the steering wheel, and then adjust the
length of the drag link to fit.
