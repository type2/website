Easiest thing you can do for a start, is to unscrew your door handles and
keep them out of sight, either under your dash on the package shelf, or if
you have a walk-thru (as I do), stick 'em on the floor between the seats.
I've been doing that for 29 years, and it thwarted two break-ins in the
70's (side windows pushed back, no entry), and who knows how many others.

After the restoration in 95, I stuck my electronic ignition module up in
the left rear spare tire well, and ran the wiring down thru a hole to the
engine - also made a removable link for the four wires from the module
that goes most of the way thru the engine compartment. The neatest trick
is the fact that the hot ignition wire to the module, after going thru the
removable link, and up into the well, goes PASSED the module, thru another
hole in the well, into the cargo area, under the bed, where it goes to a
hidden manual cutoff switch, then back to the module. The hidden cutoff
switch was replaced by a remote-operated feature on the alarm system that
I later installed, so I can cut-off the ignition with a button on the
remote.

In summary, you can remove the door handles, install a ignition cutoff
switch, and lock-up/hide your electronic ignition module.
