Hey Thomas,

If I'm not mistaken, Ronnie did a lot of testing in this area, you might
want to check the archive and worse case scenario give him a call.  I hope
I'm not misquoting him, but if I recall correctly, he determined that the
type 4 and the type 3(? or  maybe doghouse) had the same number of cooling
fins and surface area or something.  Check the archives and please don't
quote me, but look into it further, before you make any mods to you tin.
