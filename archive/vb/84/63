Subject: RE: [VB] Type 4 oil cooler mod

   From what I have seen and experienced I have found that the type 3 tight
finned cooler works as good or better then a type 4 cooler on a upright type
1 engine with a doghouse oil cooler. These are all I use on my engines and
they do run cool even in our 110 degree plus heat and the best part is very
minor mods to any of the tin except a small slice in the back of the dog
house tin where the type 3 sender goes.

Hey Thomas,

If I'm not mistaken, Ronnie did a lot of testing in this area, you might
want to check the archive and worse case scenario give him a call.  I hope
I'm not misquoting him, but if I recall correctly, he determined that the
type 4 and the type 3(? or  maybe doghouse) had the same number of cooling
fins and surface area or something.  Check the archives and please don't
quote me, but look into it further, before you make any mods to you tin.
