Thanks for the info....

I know that the "replacement" tranny is good, based on where I got it, and 
whom I got it from.  My real concerns are whether or not it has lower 
gearing than my current tranny, and whether or not I can bolt up my "large 
axle" hardware to the diff.  That is why I am trying to identify it.

I need equal or higher gearing than my current setup.

Thanks again,

Mark Chambers

Original Inquiry:
My Double Cab needs a new tranny, and it appears that I have one here which
may work, but I can't identify it.

Replacement tranny is 5-bolt, B, 113 301 103.
Original tired tranny is a 64 (mfg 6/63), 'big-nut' unit.

1.) Can anybody identify this tranny, and gear ratios? The only info that
I can find is that the 'B' designates "fully synchronized" bus.

2.) What is the gear ratios of my current, tired tranny?

3.) If the replacement tranny is a match, can I bolt up my "large" axles,
etc, to it?

Any help would be appreciated, I have searched all my books and web, with
no luck.... thanks in advance,
