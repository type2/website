Subject: rear corner replacement

I was at the local VW shop yesterday and I mentioned needing to replace both 
rear corners on my 60. The boss goes over to the corner and pulls out a full 
left corner, primered with no taillight holes. He lets me have it for $50, 
needless to say I was very happy. I have been searching for a company that 
sells an entire corner but all I can find is the bottom 10". Anyone know 
where I can get a full right corner? Anyone have one for sale?
