Subject: petty 67 tipper parts wanted

Hi All,

I'll state up front.... I don't want nos, just good used!!!!


I need parts of the throttle linkage for the tipper... 67 model year single
cab.
I'd like to find from the '[' shaped rod that connects to the gas pedal
through to the cable.
Of course, I'm most interested in the pivot pin that the L lever rotates on,
the '[' rod, and any misc washers, cotter keys, etc.

Mine has seen better days and looks as if it's been used with out all the
parts so the pivot and rod are worn badly.

If I can't find the little spring that secures the '[' rod to the L lever,
maybe I could lower myself to using a repop from Ronnie.... hey Ronnie, have
just that little spring?


Much obliged to any assistance


David
