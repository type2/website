Subject: RE: [VB] RE: Knob next to the heater knob!

On my bus, once I ripped out the ratty red carpet stuck to the floors, the 
heater box knob and the gas heater switch both had little homemade dymo 
label maker plastic stickers underneath them.  One said "big heater" and the 
other said "small heater"  I thought it was kinda cool..
