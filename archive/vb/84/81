Hi Eric,
Most likely a gas heater control knob.  If your bus was a pre-1962 model it 
would have been either a choke or reserve control cable.  These could have 
been installed in your later bus, but it is not too likely.  Of course if it 
had been owned by Evil Kneviel it probably was the parachute control knob.
