Subject: Drag link adjustment

Earlier this week I replaced the drag link (now I control where the bus
wanders; not the bus).  When I did it the steering wheel is just a little
off od center (2 oclock/8 oclock versus the old 9/3 position).  One end of
the drag link is adjustable, like on the tie rod.  Is this where I can
adjust the steering wheel position or do I need to pop the drag link and try
to align the wheel before I put the link back on.

I thought i had it aligned properly until I test drove.  It was too dark to
mess any more with it then, and am just now able to get back on it.

Thanks in advance!!
