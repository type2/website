Hi Jdd,
That will depend more on the engine you use and your expectations of how fast 
you need to scoot up the hillsides.

Since with a 3.875R&P, .82 fourth gear and 1964-67 RGBs we get 58 MPH (-at-)3,000 
RPM this is closest to want you want.  If you want to use the earlier RGBs 
you will have to use a 3.44 R&P, but we do not know exactly what fourth gear 
or the other changes in the lower gears you will need to do.  If your bus is 
going to be a daily driver we would suggest getting a 66-67 front suspension 
and 64-67 RGBs for 20% bigger brakes which feel more like 50%.  Much helpfull 
in the mountains.  The outer lower bearings these later RGBs use are much 
more durable.  Plus alot easier now and will be in the future due to more 
demand to get brake parts.
