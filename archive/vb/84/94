Subject: RE: [VB] Drag link adjustment

I just had the same exact problem on my Single Cab. I replaced the drag
link, restored my steering, only to find out that my steering wheel is off
center. That is the least of your concerns now that you have the drag link
on. Jack it up, safely block your vehicle with jackstands or whatever, then
pull your steering lever nut and with a small pully puller, pull off your
steering arm. Adjust your tires to straight, adjust your steering wheel to
straight, re-install the steering lever, nut, and cotter pin.

Subject: [VB] Drag link adjustment


Earlier this week I replaced the drag link (now I control where the bus
wanders; not the bus).  When I did it the steering wheel is just a little
off od center (2 oclock/8 oclock versus the old 9/3 position).  One end of
the drag link is adjustable, like on the tie rod.  Is this where I can
adjust the steering wheel position or do I need to pop the drag link and try
to align the wheel before I put the link back on.

I thought i had it aligned properly until I test drove.  It was too dark to
mess any more with it then, and am just now able to get back on it.

Thanks in advance!!
