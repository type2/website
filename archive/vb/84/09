Subject: Re: [VB] Tranny Rebuild Help

Just made a separate reply to John on this, but figured I'd post what I've
seen on my busses with various trans. swaps.  May not be real meaningful
because of my weird tire sizes, but is something to compare to.

58 panel small nut- 215/15 tires-
Split case - top speed 53mph, will climb anything.
3.88 works the engine real hard out on the highway or in the hills.
with 195/14 tires the 3.88 performs much like a 4:12 big nut, but maybe a
couple miles/hr extra speed.  Seems like a good match for a stock engine
set up.

67 big nut, 215/15 tires rear
New Brazilian bug trans, probably 4.37 according to Rancho.
Same tires as above so 61 is about 65 I believe, but speedo indications
and RPM should be the same.
61mph(on speedometer) = 3800rpm
4.12 trans with proper speedo readings because 195/14 tires in front only.
71 mph = 3800 rpm
3.88 trans. same tires as 4.12
71mph = 3500 rpm
I almost wish I had a 3.44 in it now, but I think I'd better wait for
summer time temps to see how things work out on the non-stock engine.
