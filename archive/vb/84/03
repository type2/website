We use the only the German cloth covered fuel line.  This is a breeze to 
install as a grommet with a hose clamp to lock it there with the slit upward. 
 Also it lasts many years and miles without wearing much on the forward sheet

The sooner the better.  Personally we would trust a long length of German 
flexable fuel line more than the aluminum tubing.
