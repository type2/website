Subject: RE: [VB] RE: Knob next to the heater knob!


I am going to check this afternoon when I get off work to see if I can find
anything in the engine area. I will look for a broken cable or holes in the
driver side area across from the battery. I will post to the list what I
find!


Thanks

	I will check to see if it has any writing on it this afternoon. It is a
black Knob and is about an inch away from the heater knob closer to the
drivers side door. That would be great if it was for a gas heater than I
would have to go buy one (Darn).


Thanks Again

Eric,
On my '65 it's a knob switch for an optional gas heater.  Mine has writing
on it.
Does yours?
