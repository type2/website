Leaky carb? Mixture adjusting screw or the hole it goes into messed
up? Failing float needle valve? Non-floating float? Too much fuel pump
pressure? Parking brake on? (It's possible!)

Greetings All,

Built a 'new' 1600 SP engine for my now finished 23 window resto bus.
Its done about
500 kms and is still 'tight' but is returning less than 15 mpg
on the highway! I've never had such shocking consumption,
even from a 'new' motor which invariably uses a bit more...

Engine is timed to a little less than 30 deg total advance,
running a 30 pict 2 carb. Choke tube is 24mm (as recomended for a 30mm
carb),
main jet is 120 (recommended as jet for 24mm choke and air correction
is 160 (bit under the +60 over main recommended). All numbers
as per the Solex Tuning manual.

Choke isn't stuck on or anything stupid like that.

I boiled out the carb and put a kit thru it. Shaft is
tight (ie not leaking petrol). Carb does sorta  'tune'
as you'd expect but winding the volume control screw
all the way in doesn't kill the engine -
does make it hunt (indicating lean). Smooths out
when winding out the volume control screw...

Pipe and plugs look richish.

What gives? Sorta baffled at this point. I put the original
36 hp oil bath cleaner on it - could this be choking it?
Just wait until its done more miles and see if it's still this bad?
I don't think a looser engine is gonna pull this in! Just
put a new carb on it?

I want to drive this from Melb to Sydney for our VW Nationals
in three weeks.  At its rate of consumption I won't make it between
petrol stations!
