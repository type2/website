Since the Westie tow hitchs U-bolted to those they must of did well, but 
these hitches also were very thickly built.  To resist the side twisting when 
turning the VW while towing.  The lighter built VOA hitches probably overcame 
this need to thicker material by having a larger triangle pattern design and 
to U-bolt to the torsion tube.

Do you mean that modified bumper brackets was working as a tow hitch?  Scary 
indeed if so!
