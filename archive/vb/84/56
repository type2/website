Well I can say that after losing both my singlecab and bus in less than a
months time i wish I had bought a toyota work truck or had been driving my
wifes Passat . I drove both of them every day as work vehicles and if i had
been driving a new car with a monthly payment I would still be enjoying them
both in the afternoons and weekends. =(
