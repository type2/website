I was looking at manifold heights for the Kadrons and the 34ICT "baby" Dells
and the 34 baby dell manifolds look shorter than the Kadron manifolds. There
are a couple of custom short throat manifolds that adapt the same carbs to
type 3 but I haven't found anyone who sells them outright. As far as whether
the application is for bus or bug, they don't make type 2 bugs !

Hi Ray,
On a bus, no problem.  On a bug the 34pict3s won't fit in there.  I think
that's probably why you never saw a kit for it.
I don't see why it can't be done on a bus, although Kadrons would probably
be pretty much the same thing but a little bigger.  Would 34pict3 fit on
Kadron manifolds?
