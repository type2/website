Subject: Re: [VB] Shift rod help! , Also found HEAVY DUTY rear shift rod Coupler

On my current project, I took out my Dremel tool (if you don't have one by
now, go get one, I use it all the time), and put on an abrasive disk (the
good thick fiber woven kind, about the size of a 50 cent piece, costs $5 for
a pack from wally world).  I like these disks better than my pneumatic
cutoff wheel because I can 'feel' when it digs into a different metal.  Once
I put on the disk, I cut two slits down the sides and just popped the
coupler in half with a large screwdriver.  No pulling, prying, or anything
else, just POP, and it was off, I nicked the shift rod in one spot about
1/16" deep, but nothing a little emery cloth won't take off.

The coupler can be found here:

Or, if you're making an order with Ronnie at oldvolks.com just tell him
whatcha need, and he'll get it.  For $8.00, it's well worth just cutting it
off.

Also, I found a Heavy Duty rear shift rod coupler.  Not too long ago a bunch
of people were complaining on how they broke their new rear shift rod
coupler like in the below link:

Well, I just received my Heavy Duty urethane shift coupler, and it seems to
be pretty stout, I will not be able to report on how well it performs for a
couple of more weeks since I'm in the process of doing the IRS swap, but I
will let you guys know.

The part is at the following link
