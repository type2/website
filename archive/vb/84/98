No,no, no, the steering arm off of the steering box. That has Nothing to do
with toe-in toe-out.

If you remove the steering arm in order to "straighten " the steering
wheel, it is likely that the toe-in will now be off and the steering
wheel will again be off center when the toe-in is properly readjusted.
You need to balance the adjustment of the tie rod and the drag link to
have the steering wheel centered and the toe-in right.  This is also
important in regards to the "center feel" in the straight forward
steering wheel position that you need to adjust in the steering gear
box.  These things all work together very nicely when you get it
right!     Gary Gibson
