Hi Al,
Most likely the fuel is leaking out of one or both lower throttle butterfly 
shaft bores.  This can be due to:

1.  Too much pressure from the fuel pump either by stuck bypass pressure 
valve in the fuel pump or too high of fuel pump push rod.

2.  Defective or worn out shut off valve in the float chamber of the 
carburetor.

3.  Bad or missing gasket on the shut off valve.

4.  Float in the carburetor is cracked or too heavy to actuate the shut off 
valve properly.

>>I have a pict 30/31 brosol with the stock jets. I think I need a 120 or 
117.5, and a 50-50 pilot/aux set up. Can anyone explain the additional jets, 
and how I should begin with setting up this carb? <<

We would suggest using the jetting data for 1970 30 PICT-3 which is the 
original German version of your carburetor from the 1968-78 Official Service 
Manual, section 3, page 30.
Main jet        X112.5
Air correction 140Z
Pilot jet         g 65
Pilot jet air bleed 135

If you are using the pre-1968 1500cc air cleaner these jets will most likely 
run a bit rich still.  So you might have to go to slightly smaller main and 
pilot jets and/or going to larger air correction and pilot air bleed jets.
  We still are trying to figure out the Pilot jet air bleed.  So far it seems 
to be a jet to allow a metered amount of air into the idle circuit to allow 
for proper fuel air mixture and helps with atomizing the fuel by mixing in 
the air in the idle jet passages.
