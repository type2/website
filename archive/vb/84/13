 I went & filled up the 70 westy this morning and looked in my fuel/mileage 
data.
 I have a palm pilot app that keeps track of my vehicles.
 I now see that there must have been a leak for about 2000 miles as the fuel 
consumption had increased guess that the metal fuel pipe was weeping and that 
will give you bad gas mileage,
 The moral is that if you keep a log you can see symptoms of a problem before 
they cause a problem.
 I should have looked for why my gas mileage had dropped from 18 to 16 mpg.

 Did the metal line show signs of having worn through?  an actual hole?   if 
so, you could just cut it the rest of the way and use it shorter, or maybe 
the leak was from the gas line being old.  If not, it must have been the old 
fuel line.   Did Tim replace that fuel line when the bus was painted?  If 
not, was it ever done?    Anyway, you've had red westy a long time now, these 
pieces do get old.

Often the grommet is dead or missing, so being  I use a piece of old fuel 
line to grommet the metal line rather than go buy a grommet.  Instant 
gratification.  You can put the grommet in from either side of the tin. helps 
to bevel the end you are installing.   When you got the doghouse set up  
installed, they should have put a grommet in the tin.   

The gas milage in my 61 has dropped considerably.   Since it is a 7 mile 
round trip to campus & back, and I let the bus warm up in the morning, it 
runs for as long at idle as it does motorvating,    now about 16mpg instead 
of 20+ (23 or 24 on hwy).
