Hi Mike,
Try any Lowes hardware store.  What you need is an O-ring that snugly or even 
slightly has to stretch onto the link pin.  When on the link pin is wide 
enough to fit snugly in the groove and seal it at the same time.  Too wide of 
O-ring?  Then try a smaller on stretched on so as to thin itself due to 
stretching.
Of course Ronnie of oldvolkshome should have these!
