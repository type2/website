I don't want to lose the ability to travel in the mountains.  I would like to be able to go .... maybe 70 at 3800 rpms and maybe 60 at 3000.  What kinda gearing and R and P will I need?

If you don't want to lose the hill-climbing ability--stay stock or get a 3:88 or whatever and build a bigger motor.

Any of the freeway-flier trannys will lose it on the hills unless you have the extra motor to compensate.

I'm running a big-nut 3:88 and a 1600 DP, 010 dizzy, 34 PICT carb and stock exhaust (205-75 tires on 15 inch rims).

I just hooked up a tach a few days ago. So off the top of my head--I run about 3300 (-at-) 60 (flats).  I did take it up to 70 last night on the freeway and believe I was running real close to 4000.

My 63's sweet spot seems to be right at 62-63 mph.  So usually I run it there on the highway  I have run it for extended periods at 65 with no worries..any faster I just don't care to drive in a splitty.

I do alot of mountain driving (everyday to work) and you will definately have to downshift to third on grades. I will jot down my RPM's to be sure tonight on the ride home and give you a p-mail with accurate numbers.

Anyways....true mountains,curves and steep grades.. the 3:88 doesn't bother me at all---hell, you're going slower anyways due to the roads.  
What does get to be a pain is being out on the freeway with a long steep grade.....where you just have to poke along in 3rd(-at-)40-45 mph for eternity..or at least it seems that way.

Hope something in there helped ya =)
