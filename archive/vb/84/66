Is that little spring not the same ones as used to hold the thermostat
flaps to the bar that runs between them? On my early '64 it is, even
if it shouldn't be...

If I can't find the little spring that secures the '[' rod to the L
lever,
maybe I could lower myself to using a repop from Ronnie.... hey
Ronnie, have
just that little spring?


Much obliged to any assistance
