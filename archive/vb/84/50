Subject: Need door handle

Hi. I need a passenger (front) door, inside handle for my '67. I know several years will work- it's the splined shaft with the screw in the middle, not the earlier style with the pin. I would prefer the metal long-spoony looking one (for lack of a better term) instead of the flatter, plastic ones (like the '67 had originally). Anyway, I don't particularly want NOS or even shiny, just one that will work and not break any time soon. I'm in Raleigh, NC, so close would be nice, but I'm willing to pay postage/handling or whatever. Please drop me an e-mail if you've got a nice cheap one.
thanks,
