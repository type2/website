Ray,

If you did that to adjust your steering wheel, you jumped in with that frog. 8^)

Don't move the arm on the shaft. That will make it so you have a different number of turns to lock in each direction. The arm and shaft have marks that should line up. The way to center the wheel is to remove the drag link from the arm, center the wheels, center the steering wheel, and then adjust the length of the drag link to fit.
