Hi Robert,
Choke tube?  Do you mean the venturi?  It should be 24mm diameter.

 main jet is 120 (recommended as jet for 24mm choke and air correction

The 68-78 bus Official Service Manual reccomends in section 3, page 30:
Main jet X116
Air correction jet  125Z
Pilot jet  55
Pilot Jet Air Bleed 135
As for using a 36HP air cleaner it will definitely run richer due to that!  
So again you probably need smaller Pilot, main jets, and/or bigger Air 
correction, Pilot Air Bleed jets are probably needed.  Also your description 
of the idle screw adjustment sounds too rich due to too big of Pilot jetting.
Of course if you are cruising it well above 3,000 RPM your MPG is going to 
suffer greatly.
