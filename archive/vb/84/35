Hello Everyone

	I just got my 1965 21 window Deluxe Started after it had been in storage
over 13 years from the PO. I put a New battery in it and it came to life
(Yippee!). I have a question about the Knob that is next to the heater knob
what is it? I pull the knob out with no cable attached and I am wondering if
it is some kind of choke.
