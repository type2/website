Subject: radio shack radio

I bought ($20) and installed a radio shack cat#12-2004 radio/cassette
player in the ratwagen over the weekend. I had to enlarge the shaft
holes by about 1mm, but otherwise it fit great. It is a cheap radio,
but sure beats having none. It seems there is a shaft style where the
centre section is just a hair bigger and won't fit, I've been duped by
a couple of those.
An employee of radio shack told me they were getting out of the car
audio business, so this might be coming up to your last chance to get
one of these imitation gems.
