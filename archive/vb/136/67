Subject: Re: [VB] CHT Gauge Wiring

I wish I had been looking at that diagram.  I made the mistake of
looking only at the paper diagrams that came with my order of several
gauges.  Four pieces of paper, some two-sided, with directions for
pressure, fuel, clock, engine hour, and "rudder position indicator"
gauges, but no CHT.  Matt's pointer to the VDONA tech page with the
correct diagram solved my problem.

Mentally, I was missing the "thermocouple, which generates its own
(tiny) voltage" concept, and looking for a way to get 12-volts in there
somewhere.  Thanks, Matt.

Steve's (Westfalia) concern about the length of wires may be a problem
for me as well.  I haven't installed the harness yet. If I can find a
way to route the wires on my split so they reach from the engine to the
dash without splicing, I'll post it.

I'm guessing that this is the same thing you're looking at:

The text could be clearer but the diagram seems pretty clear -
the red wire from the sender goes to + and the black wire goes
to the upside-down fir tree.  I suspect that the sender is a
thermocouple, which generates its own (tiny) voltage.  This
would remove the need for +12V or ground at the gauge.
