Hi Nick,
Some of that can be done if not drilled all the way through the fins you can 
get to, to give a dimple affect and increase surface area.  The ones we do 
are more to open up fins that otherwise are closed to allowing full flow of 
cooling air through much like as is shown in the 1963-67 VW bus shop manual 
for drilling 40 HP heads.  For instance in 1300, 1500, & 1600 heads we drill 
the fins at the top of the exhaust ports to allow the cooling air to go 
somewhere and not be blocked by the exhaust port casting.  Of course removing 
any and all casting flash from the head fins is a must.  We found about half 
of the fins in the new Brazilian heads we use to be clogged this way!  We 
have found simular casting flash in German heads also, but not as bad.  Using 
a circular saw with carbide blade removes the casting flash in about five 
minutes.  You just have to have a steady hand with the saw!
