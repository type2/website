OK let's try this again. This time it will be rain or shine. If it's raining be ready to play mud football! 
  I am putting together a picnic at Cullen park (Saums near Barker Cypress) Anyone with a VW or VW interests is invited. Sunday July 14 meet at the exK-Mart Hwy 6 (-at-) Cairnway at 11am for a cruise to the park. The park has lots of tree cover and is a beautiful place for a picnic. BYOF (food) They have small BBQ pits or you can bring your own. 
If you have any questions or need directions p-mail me.



Thanks,
