Subject: Hard to shift into first and second??

I recently installed a new tranny in my '61 bus and shifting into first and
second is really tough. Reverse, third and fourth are OK.   I found some
info in the archives on this but I'm still not 100% clear on how to adjust
the shifter.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.  Don...
