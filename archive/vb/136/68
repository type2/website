Subject: Re: [VB] Hard to shift into first and second??

I did this recently...
Budget an hour or two of your patience and 15 minutes of 
a helper's time for the optional part. Get out a 13mm 
socket or end wrench, some grease and a pencil or sharp 
marker. Optional... Set the parking brake and get under 
the front of the bus. Remove the pedal pan if it's 
there. Watch the front shift mechanism while the helper 
moves the shifter into the gears slowly so you know how 
the shift rod rotates and moves. Gob some grease into 
the obvious places where metal hits metal. 
Then dismiss the helper. Remove the floor mat 
completely. Mark the floor around the ovalesque shift 
plate for a reference. 
Loosen the front and rear 13mm bolts just enough to move 
the plate. Move it a bit one way or the other, tighten 
and test drive. Repeat until your patience is gone or 
the shifting's improved.
