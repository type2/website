Subject: Re: [VB] new aftermarket crankshat pulley

Ya, I was wondering about the cooling issue of changing the fan/gen ratio.  
It's said that it'll cool the engine better to have the fan turning faster.  
I was wondering if anyone has direct experience on this.  P&C? didn't you 
guys do that on your double door?

I did put a smaller gen pulley in my 65, but I haven't driven it enough yet 
to tell if it runs cooler, plus it's a different motor so that's another 
variable.   I did have to get a smaller fan belt.  And I do have to be 
careful when stepping on the gas from idle, or it spins the belt.  The belt 
is a tad small still, I have lotsa shims between the pulley halves, but the 
next size up I found was too big, so I figured this one might stretch a 
little, as belts do, and be fine.

 As has been noted, the generator would produce more power, but the
 regulator would keep the output relatively constant.  Having a bigger
 engine/generator pulley ratio would help a little, because generators
 have to be turning some minimum RPM to work, and the bigger ratio
 would get the generator to that point quicker.  Mostly it would help
 on short trips or in heavy traffic when you start, stop, and idle a
 lot. >>
