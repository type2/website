Hi Matt,
Good question, even as far back as WWII the Germans found that driving in 
North Africa they had to drive slower in the heat down there to keep the 
engine from running way too hot.  Even as late as the early 1960s the VW bus 
shop manual mentions installing a larger lower pulley in buses and drilling 
fins of the heads to increase cooling.  The latter we also do on our all our 
1200-1641cc engines.
