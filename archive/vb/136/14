The Bentley Book.
Printed by Bentley Publishers, I beleive this is considered the official
Workshop Manual. In other words any official VW mechanic had to have one of
these. The version I am referring to covers VW transporters from the year
1963-1967. I believe you could get this book from amazon.com, maybe at
olkdvolks.com or busdepot.com. The book is a very technically oriented book.
When I first got my bus it came with the Bentley manual and John Muirs
Idiots Guide(I forget the exact title). Anyway Muirs book was way more
helpful when I first started trying to work on the bus-I still use it now.
The Bentley Manual has proved more useful-the more I understand my bus.
Basically when I first started looking at the bentley manual-i was like a
bit overwhelmed with the technical stuff. But thanks to the list and Muir I
understand it much better now.

I definitely recommend both books to any VW owner.

>Dear Kevin
I see a lot of reference to a "Bentley Book". Can you tell me more about it,
please?

We have her in South Africa only the British Motorbooks, which are very good
indeed and, from travels to Europe, i have the occasional german manual, but
nothing really to brag about.

Would you be so kind, as to tell me where i might find such a book, and,
(for us very important!!) how much it would cost.
