The tipper has a new/old 1600 sp in it and does very well.... ok ok, not
stock... but i digress.

On my trip to LA for the octo/classic weekend I averaged just over 20 mph
and could cruise on flats at between 100 and 110 km/h... sometimes all the
way up to 120!   The motor did well up and over hills although some were a
3rd gear, 65km/h event.  (  ... see, with the metric system, you can go real
fast ;-)    )

I was razzed for going slow by people with *big* 1600 dp and up engines.
But I really feel that that size of engine fits well with the utility of an
old bus.
