Hi retarrdo,
1600 DP is good for the bugs and KGs for quick accelleration, but for the 
heavier bus more low end torque is better which one gets with the SP.  the 
differance between the is the intake manifold and how that affects the 
breating of the engine.  As for if either has enough power depends on how 
much HP you expect and how it is geared for which purpose.
