Subject: RE: [VB] duh....shouldve asked this in the first place

Didn't John Muir write a "Retardo's Guide" to Fixing Your VW?

Seriously though, if it's really that difficult for you, perhaps you should
try to find a local vw club or someone who can show you all this stuff.

It's kinda hard to believe that if you look in the Muir Book, or Bentley, or
any other book that has a diagram of an engine in it, that you can't match
up the picture to your engine.  In the book, the coil will probably have a
number next to it, with an explanation of the numbers at the bottom of the
picture.  Find the thing that looks like what the book calls the coil on
your engine.  THAT IS THE COIL ! ! !
