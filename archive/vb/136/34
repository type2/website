Hi Clara,
What would be really interesting is to have someone figure out the ratio of 
having this new larger lower pulley.  The problem with this is differant 
upper pulleys and even the belt width or length change or wear of either will 
affect the pulley ratio!  We found out upper stock pulleys can make a 
differances, while we were preping up the 1960 walkthru panel camper 
conversion for the 700+ mile one way trip to Sacramento in late May.  Had 
been wondering if it was time to replace the old upper pulley with "D" shaped 
locking system between the pulley halfs due to wear and tear on it.  So found 
a pristine stock upper pulley with the old style two locking prongs.  Before 
removing the old pulley we it hit us to check the ratio.  We were using a 
905mm long belt with 15 shims to work with the shorter belt and 2:1 lower 
pulley with the 3/8" tall "D" stamped on one of the pie corragations of the 
pulley.  

  With the "D" shaped locking upper pulley we turned the lower pulley 7 times 
to get the upper pulley to turn an even 13 turns for a ratio of 1.857:1 or 
5,571 RPM (-at-) 3,000 crankshaft RPM.

  With the earlier two prong locking system upper pulley we turned the lower 
pulley 8 times to get the upper pulley to turn an even 15 times for a ratio 
of 1.875:1 or 5,625 RPM (-at-) 3,000 crankshaft RPM .

   Hmmmmmm, so we dug around in our pile of generators for any other upper 
pulleys and found a 356 Porsche upper pulley on a 6 volt VW generator!  
Insert evil laugh here.  Installed this upper pulley and found the 905mm VW 
stock belt to be totally loose.  Went to the FLAPS and bought for about $7.00 
a "Fresh Start" brand # 13345 10AV0875 belt, which we installed and "Viola" 
just one turn of the lower pulley showed a ratio of 2.4:1 or 7,200 RPM (-at-) 
3,000 crankshaft RPM!  With this belt two of the thicker Porsche pulley half 
shims were on the rear which meant we could use a smaller belt if we 
wanted.......

  Drove the 1960 panel camper conversion to the FLAPS to see if we could find 
a smaller length belt.  The fellow behind the counter was happy to let us try 
out a "Gates" brands # 7340 belt.  Now needed a couple of VW shims in 
addition to the Porsche pulley shims.  Result of a shade over 2.75:1 ratio or 
8,250 RPM (-at-) 3,000 crankshaft RPM.  Boy the heating system blows like crazy up 
front in 50F weaher now even when idling!  So we are not cavatating as far as 
we can tell.
 
  We took our 1400+ mile round trip to Sacramento CA with the stock VW upper 
pulley and belts just in case.  Encountered about 90F degree weather between 
Redding and Sacramento which are about 163 miles apart and on our way back 
North on this stretch we had a strong 20-30 mile head wind and the road is 
slowly rising up to the Syskiyou Mountains just North of Redding.  Normally 
on this roadway and conditions we would run a little over 210F oil temp while 
having to drop down about 2MPH below 3,000 RPM in fourth gear doing about 58 
MPH.  With the higher cooling fan speed we ran about 195F oil temp with Barb 
still dropping down the 2 MPH below the 3,000 RPM mark and only hitting 210F 
for two or three times for only a few short periods a couple minutes at most 
each time due to the head wind and possibly steeper roadway at the time.  Not 
a huge change, but an improvement!  So we have now in mid July have over 
3,000 miles on this setup and have not blown up the fan, so it looks like 
this is going to work!
