Just a note that most belt part numbers encode the length in either
inches or millimeters.  Usually, inch-sized belts come in half-inch
increments.  For the belts in E&B's post:

Stock                       905 mm  35.6 in
Fresh Start 13345 10AV0875  875 mm  34.4 in
Gates       7340            864 mm  34.0 in
