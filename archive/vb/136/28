Hi retarrdo,
The best engine you can have for your bus is the one you build!  With the 
experience gained re/building one, you have a much greater grasp of what the 
engine does and how to fix it if something goes wrong later.  Plus if you 
take your time you can do stuff no engine rebuilder can do economicly like 
polishing and blueprinting the engine.
   If you do not have the time to do an engine you should check the Archives 
for info on Butch down in San Diego.   We are running one of his engines in 
our 1960 panel van camper conversion with 3.875 R&P freeway flier, it is a 
1641 SP CW crank, plus new Brazilian heads with oversized stemed exhaust 
valves to prevent stretching and now has over 50,000 miles on it with no 
problems.  The only special things we added to it was a full flow oil 
filter/pump and type 4 cooler in dog house shroud.   Last time we heard you 
can get this same engine with trade in of your core engine for $1,100 or for 
$1,300 with new all aluminum Brazilian engine case.  He is also selling the 
all aluminum engine case outright for $300.00.  Please tell Butch we said 
"Hi!".
