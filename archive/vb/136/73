Subject: Re: [T2] Side tent 4 Bus

I saw someone with a tent from Cabela's at Everybus. It is listed in the
catalog for $199.
He said it was made for an SUV, but I thought it worked very nicely. I am
not sure how he attached it to the bus though.
I can't get my browser to work, but I know that cabela's has a website.
www.cabelas.com
