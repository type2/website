I'm guessing that this is the same thing you're looking at:

The text could be clearer but the diagram seems pretty clear -
the red wire from the sender goes to + and the black wire goes
to the upside-down fir tree.  I suspect that the sender is a
thermocouple, which generates its own (tiny) voltage.  This
would remove the need for +12V or ground at the gauge.

A simple test would be to hook it up in the kitchen and see if 
the gauge reacts when you dunk the sender ring in some boiling
water.  If you want to test at a higher temperature, set the
oven at 300-400 degrees, and when it's up to temperature, open
the door and (carefully!) hold the sensor ring against the rack
or the side of the oven.

On a related note:

If the gauge is indeed a thermocouple, this is probably because of
the tiny voltages you're working with.  Common type J and K
thermocouples only produce 10 - 20 mV over the range of a CHT gauge.
A crummy splice or connection can drop this small voltage to nothing.

Also, if you extend the wires and don't use the same kind of wire
that was originally used, you'll create another tiny thermocouple
at each dissimilar splice, which will further alter the results.
