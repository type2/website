Subject: VolksAir and 67 SC for sale

Got my last unfinished VolksAir air compressor out on E-Bay:

I was going to use it for sand blasting on my truck, but the metal is so
lightweight
I think I'll pick up an electric compressor with lower volume air. If I get
a buyer for the
truck soon, I'll shelve the entire project.
