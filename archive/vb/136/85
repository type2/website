Hi Don,
We hope you replaced all the shift linkage bushings, especially the rear ones 
while you had the tranny out since that is the only way to get them both out. 
 Now assuming you have put everything back together correctly, we would guess 
you need the shifter to lean over to the left a tad bit more to engage first 
and second better.  This would mean you need to move the shifter base 
slightly to the right!  The ball like shape of the pressed metal of the 
shifter just below the shifter boot is a pivot.  Because of this when you 
move the stick shift left the very bottom of the lever below this pivot moves 
to the right!  Same when moving the stick shift forward to get into first or 
third the lower end of the lever below the pivot move to the rear.  So all 
adjustments must be made with this opposite effect in mind.
