Subject: RE: [VB] duh....shouldve asked this in the first place

... if it's that bad, I would suggest fixing/untangling the wiring now to
match what should be while the engine is out.  Sounds to me like you might
be fighting this thing forever if you don't get a handle on it soon!

understand some of them, a little bit, but it would be easier to see a
real life picture instead of a perfectly segmented color coordinated
(which isnt how mine is AT ALL) totally fictional diagram of something
that does'nt relate to my wiring at all. they should draw the wiring
diagram all tangled up and un matched colors with electrical tape
holding connections together and wires tied to the deck lid.
