What would be really interesting is to have someone figure out the ratio of 
having this new larger lower pulley.  The problem with this is differant 
upper pulleys and even the belt width or length change or wear of either
will 
affect the pulley ratio!

While checking out someone's VW Trike this morning with a 1776 converted
upright type four, I noticed that he was using a newer oversize crank
pulley. I pulled one my parts pulleys out of the back of my truck and placed
it up against his and his was larger than stock by almost 14mm. The typical
upright conversion for type 4 uses a stock Porsche pulley, the same diameter
as our stock type 1/2 pulleys. I asked him how the fan sounded at high RPM
and he said it really whistled. He was thinking of putting on a larger
alternator pulley to slow the fan down.

If I want more air on a 1500sp, I just install the 71-74 wider fan on the
generator, that usually takes care of that if everything else is tight.
