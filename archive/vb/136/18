ok, im being told that i should i buy a rebuilt engine. But, i was 
thinking of buying the scat engine becuase it's pretty much all new 
(except for the block? apparently?) so, what do you guys think, spend 
the $3500 on a mostly new engine with heater boxes and crap, OR spend 
like $1000 on a rebuilt one. (i just see more reliability in the scat 
engine)
