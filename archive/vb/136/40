sorry if getting annoying everyone...do you have a 1600 DP engine? do 
you think you could send me some pictures of it in the bus? and maybe 
send a picture of the wiring back there too =D??????????? (like what 
comes out of the voltage regulator, mine is converted to a 12v) 
pllleeeeeaaseee?? i dont have enough to afford my engine yet, and its 
getting boring looking at a hole. and plus ill be able to learn before i 
get it.
