Subject: CHT Gauge Wiring

Earlier this week there was a good post from Matt Roberds about wiring
for an ammeter installation.  I've gone back through the archives
looking for Cylinder Head Temperature gauge discussion and seen nothing
on the CHT subject except where to put the sender, who has replacement
senders, and what an appropriate CHT is for our engines.

I recently decided to bite the bullet and invest in some VDO gauges,
including CHT.  I found the VDO schematics for wiring to be sufficient
for everything but the CHT gauge.  I have the sender (12mm hole) which
I'll mount on a #3 head stud.  I have the CHT wiring harness that plugs
into the sender and has two wires (red and black).  Ignoring the dash
light bulb socket, there's a "+" and a "V" (ground) spade on the back of
the gauge.

The short question is "what goes where?"  Clearly, I have to tap into
fused 12-volt power, connect both wires from the sender, and provide a
good ground for the gauge.  I assume the sender is sufficiently grounded
by being bolted to the case.

One or more of the folks here has done this already and I'd just like
to get their insight for my personal use and for anyone else searching
the archives.   My bus is a '67, stock 12 volt, so that's not an issue.
Enlighten me.
