Mostly new and $3500?!!

Build it yourself with a NEW case (mag. or alum.) and COUNTERWEIGHTED
crank!  Don't cheep out on those two things.  Get a forged crank if you
are going to be revving over 5K. Have all moving parts balanced
dynamically too.  

If you don't feel confident enough to build one yourself, then buy a NEW
Mexican motor.  It'll be the best money you'll spend...and it won't cost
you $3500 either!  Just ask George...oh, but put good GERMAN 8 mm studs
in it...right George?
