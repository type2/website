Subject: Re: [VB] New Bus---suspension questions

Congrats on the new bus!!!!  pics? so-44s are cool.

on 66/67 wiper motors there is a nut you can undo (10mm?) then pull the 
splined thingy off,and put it back on so the wipers are parked where you want them, 
without removing the wiper motor.   It is sort of in the middle, probably 
hard to get to if there is a radio installed.   I can try to take a pic and send 
it if this doesn't help.   it's wher ethe shafts to the wiper pivots meet in 
the middle.

go through the John Muir/ idiot book method for investigating what is wrong 
with the steering, and give everything a good lube so FRESH grease comes out.

spindles rebuild do not include new links.    Do you need new links?   you 
really need to take the old ones out to check.  I think new are about $100 a set 
(takes care of both sides).  Keep any good used ones for future spares, and 
keep the pins/needle bearings/bushings together as a set, do not mix and match. 
 Adjusting links and wheel bearings can sometimes take out a bunch of slop.

I've seen bad swing levers make icky noises.   

there were different batches of velvet green that came out slightly 
different.   also, different sun exposure ages the paint differently.  Did you polish 
the bits up?    that colour darkens with age.  Engine compartment colour is 
closer to original.
