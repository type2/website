I saw the messages blur by in the past few days regarding kids and
entertainment....  In a totally unrelated task, I came across the
following snippet regarding the growing need for embedded system
developers.

<A key source of that growth, according to Renesas Technology America,
will come from so-called vehicle-based entertainment services. Last
year, this U.S. subsidiary of a joint venture between Hitachi Ltd. and
Mitsubishi Electric Corp. set out to accelerate the proliferation of
telematics and "car infotainment systems" (CIS) products based on its
SuperH (SH-4 series) RISC processors and chipsets... blah blah blah>


As a 0 TV owner, my stomach churns.  And to think of the poor bastards
50 years from now searching for that "plastic knob for an '06 VW
entertainment remote control".  Hell, it takes long enough to find the
few parts for a '59!
