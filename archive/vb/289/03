Recharging your battery at a very low rate.  It won't help much while
you're driving, but if you're parked for a day or three in a sunny spot,
it will help a little.

>when do you plugem in?

When you have parked the vehicle in a sunny spot and want to charge up
the battery a little bit.  Check the directions that came with it; you
can leave most of them plugged in all the time, but some of them _must_
be unplugged when it's dark or they will drain your battery!

It's not much juice.  If one of your dash lights got stuck on, it would
"outrun" the charging provided by the smaller ones and still drain your
battery.

This doesn't apply in your case, but it's expensive juice, too.  JC
Whipme lists a few solar cells on their Web site.  Assuming that they
put out 15 V at their rated current, and that electricty from your power
company costs 10 cents a kilowatt hour, here's a comparo:

 Solar    kWh    Solar cell   Hours the solar cell
 Cell     from   output at    would have to run
 Price    grid   15 V DC      to pay for itself
 $17.99   179.9  0.04 A max   300,000 hours (68.4 years at 12 hrs/day)
 $39.99   399.9  0.08 A max   333,000 hours (76.0 years at 12 hrs/day)
 $67.99   679.9  0.50 A max    90,700 hours (20.7 years at 12 hrs/day)
$189.99  1899.9  1.00 A max   127,000 hours (28.9 years at 12 hrs/day)
$339.99  3399.9  2.00 A max   113,000 hours (25.9 years at 12 hrs/day)
$489.99  4899.9  3.00 A max   109,000 hours (24.8 years at 12 hrs/day)

Put another way, solar cell factories do not (yet) run on solar cells.

There are some applications for which solar cells _are_ a good solution,
like communications repeaters in remote locations (the desert, the
mountains, a geosynchronous orbit) where there isn't a handy socket to
plug into.  But for now, for everything else, they aren't a very good
idea.  One source I tend to believe has said that given the incremental
improvements in solar cells, the high-quality ones will be competitive
with grid power in 10 to 15 years.
