I have been replacing or putting back the rubber seals on the doghouse
tin and also gluing back on a foam strip on the back of the cooler to
help seal and keep the tin from leaking air.

Yep. I've scrounged a few extra for future motors too. I don't have
cooling problems on these motors, so the air is adequet going through
it, but when I first checked it, I expected the same amount that came
out of the heater outlets on the shroud.  Not even close..
