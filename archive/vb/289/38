Now here we go.....

As for the secondary battery....I think plenty of solutions have been presented lately.

My plans are to do the following before Havasu in Jan.:

Set up a secondary battery with an isolator on the left side of the engine compartment.

Run wire from the secondary battery to the cargo area and hook them up to a 12V lighter socket.  Along with this a voltmeter hooked up near the socket only hooked to the secondary battery.

If needed, I will hook up my converter when camping to run whatever may be needed...usually a cell phone charger, since I can never find my 12V one.

I know the previous isn't exactly what you are looking for...but do an online search for Camping World and check out their website.  They have tons of converters, a lot of them designed for permanent installation.  I can easily see one of these set up to run on a secondary battery then mated with the existing electrical outlet.  They have to have some type of similar setup in RV's.
