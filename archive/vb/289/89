  I have an NOS BN4 heater instalation kit. It has a type 3 part number 311
963 107 C on the timer switch and no number on the rest of the install kit.
The switch has a timer on it, which I don't know whatfor and there is a
relay 113 963 141B which also must have something to do with it. 
  So you might need to check the fuses, relay and timer switch first.

As far as the switches.....one an/timer switch.  You click it over to the 
right to turn it on, or turn it past to use as a timer when preheating the car.  
Timer seems to be working fine.

The other is the temp. control.  Simple push/pull type that works the temp. 
regulator switch.  Seems fine.

At the fusebox all is well.  As for checking the relays....I dl'ed the BN-4 
troubleshooting manual from the docs project...good chit, will go through that 
this weekend.
