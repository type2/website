Subject: Oil cooler question

71 Westy, stock 1600 DP. Dog-house style oil cooler,
right? Well here's my question: On the front of the
"doghouse" compartment tin, there is a little "Scoop"
for lack of a better word. It faces the front of the
bus and kinda looks like a tiny range or stove hood,
If your hand was small enough you could reach up there
and touch the oil cooler, obviuosly created for the
flow of air. But my question is: Does cool air flow
INTO this scoop to cool the oil cooler, or does hot
air flow OUT OF this scoop after it has already passed
throu the oil cooler.  Another way to look at this
question is "Where does cooling air come from right
before it hits the oil cooler??
