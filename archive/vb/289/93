Sounds like a power supply problem.Check for power at the switch and at the
various points on the heater that should recieve power when operating.The
pump can be tested on or off the vehicle just apply 12V.
As for power....I have juice at the main power lead coming in (approx. 14 ga. 
red), and if I follow that wire to the next relay I have juice at that 
terminal.

That is it, no other juice anywhere.  Switch on or off, can't get the test 
lamp to go off anywhere but the fat red.

Thanks for the help,
