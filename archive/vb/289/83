Subject: RE: [VB] Rotating Bus tires

When I got a new car with radials, the manual said to rotate the
traditional (bias ply) way (rear straight forward, front crossed over to
back).  Since I had been taught long ago (70's) that this would destroy
radials, I went to the Michelin website
(http://michelinman.com/care/tip2.html) where it specifies the crossing
over method.  The only variation is if you have front wheel drive, the
front wheels go straight back and the rears cross over.  

Apparently, in the early days of radials, when bias ply was more common,
they hadn't worked out the technology for the radial plys.  Back then,
if you flipped them side to side (so I was told) they could self
destruct as the plys took a new set due to rotating in the other
direction.  This doesn't seem to be the case now, since Michelin
recommends the cross-over technique.
