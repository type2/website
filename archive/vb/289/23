I haven't heard whether it was a factory three terminal alternator or an
aftermarket two terminal Motorola. I had a problem with the diode pack
blowing up on high charge, even though it was rated at 50 amps. I
eventually took one of the bad ones and pulled the diode pack out,
extended the wires and kluged up a diode pack with 10 amp diodes on an
external board. I use this one just for testing engines and then pull it
off and install a new one later.

what guage wire did you have running from the alt->isolator->2nd
battery?

I've found that the 12 or 14 gauge wire (whatever was recommended) isn't

cutting it for charging my 2ndary and that I'm occasionally having to
recharge at home (kinda a pain).  I have been thinking about moving to
10
ga. but have concerns about overworking my alternator (and the wire
coming
loose).  Then again, i've heard some success stories from people using
10
ga, so...

thoughts?
