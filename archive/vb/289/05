The '50-'62 Bentley (*1) lists the 0.016" spec (0.40 mm) for all the
distributors in it, but also mentions a setting of 51 to 55 degrees
(53 +/- 2 degrees) when checking the distributor on a test stand.
The '63-'67 Bentley (*2) also has the 0.016" and 53 +/- 2 degrees spec
for Bosch distributors on summer '62 - early '64 production.  From
early 1964 production, the Bosch spec is 50 +/- 3 degrees.  They
list one VW distributor that is set at 50 +/- 2 degrees.  The
bay Bentley says to adjust new points to 47 +/- 3 degrees, while
used points are acceptable if they are within 50 +/- 8 degrees.

Muir reduced all this to 50 +/- 2 degrees which IMHO isn't too bad
of a compromise and is easy to remember.

If I had your engine, I'd go with the 51-55 degree spec, and maybe
aim for the upper end of that range.

I hope this helps!

   Amazon.com, or check with list vendors
*2 about 800 Rand+Customs fees, as above

note: I don't work for Amazon or make money from them.  I just think
that if you have a 40-year-old car, it might behoove you to have the
original manual for it.
