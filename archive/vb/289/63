The only tires I've seen that are directional, are high end, highperformance
tires, and off road only tires.

I've heard that the reason a tire should stay on it's original side of the
car, is the sidewall plies take a 'set', and flipping them to the other side
makes them want to 'set' the other direction, and can result in a messed up
sidewall.  I personally don't buy it. There's torque on the tire when you
accelerate, and the opposite direction when you brake. In that theory, the
tire sidewall is 'setting' both directions wether you like it or not.

I'll admit, I don't rotate my tires. I guess I could give the excuse that
it's cold and wet, and I don't want to be out in the weather, but i'll be
honest. I'm too lazy, and never had a problem before. As long as my tires
wear evenly (on my buses they seem to), I don't do anything. Ignorance is
bliss? Probably.

All my years of owning Bug's, they've always had a different size tire up
front than in the rear, so I never rotated those either.

I probably would rotate my bus tires if they started showing different wear,
but as it is right now, no problem...........
