   He didnt ask for anyones comment on his kids, or the entertaining of his 
kids.
Lets end this unless it REALLY pertains to  adding the second battery, or an 
isolator
or a bigger alternator, etc. If I were to look into this, I would probably 
look into the
car stereo newsgroups, those guys all run 2 or more batteries, and isolators 
and the
whole shebang. I did this on a CRX of mine way back when with bad results 
and wouldnt
do it again. (Honda alternators are not good). Id probably recommend  one of 
those super
90's kymco (or whoever sells), a GOOD single battery, and up to snuff 
wiring. (fatter
gauge wiring from the bat to alternator) and Id think youd be good to go. To 
park and
watch movies for hours this wont help, but on the road id think it would be 
fine for most
that you could throw at it...
