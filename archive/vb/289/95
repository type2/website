No, it doesn't burn.  I do it too, and that's what VW did, thoughthe old foam 
is often gone.   It basically keep the air from going around the cooler.  
Makes it flow through the cooler.   The foam goes on the top and side next to the 
fan shroud, \so if you look at the doghouse (engine out) from the side the 
air comes out of, you see a layer of foam between the shroud and cooler, instead 
of an air gap.   the L shaped hoover bits also came with a tad of foam on it, 
and the vent cover, to seal things up   around the edges.
