Subject: RE: [VB] Rotating Bus tires

Many radials are directional which would mean you would keep the tires
on the same side of the vehicle (hence rolling in the same direction).

Gary asked: Question for the day, originally our buses came with bias
ply tires and the
tire rotation was front to rear, keeping the lefts on the left and
rights on
the right.  Nowadays, we mostly are running radials, so do we do the
radial
tire rotation moving the rear to the front and the front to the opposite
rear?  Just a curious question to see what some of y'all do.
