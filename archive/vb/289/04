Hi Eric,
The keys you mention are aftermarket keys so do not have the stock VW letter 
code on them.  Do you have a key manufacture embossed on them?  The 1967 and 
later keys are cut on two side where the pre-1967 keys are only cut on one 
edge.  You mention that you have some tumblers, but do not mention having handles. 
 The handles will have the Letter and numeral code stamped into them.  You 
need to find this stamping on the handles to find out what key series you have 
and thusly you can fit an aftermarket key to the tumbler.  Unless of course the 
tumber is so worn out that one could stick in a popsicle stick!  BTDT.....
