I'll chime in on what Eric previously stated...

Yes I did not have a TV in the car when I was a kid....I also did not have a VCR growing up until I was about 18...come to think of it, my parents didn't have cable TV until I was almost in college.  I also did with hand me down clothes, new bikes and on and on.  Would I do the same for my children just because I did without?  Not a chance in hell.

I spoil my kids will all of the things I couldn't have when I was a kid.  Not that my parents were evil, just that they didn't have the money.  I'm a little better off and so I will do these things for my kids.

TVs and VCRs in the car are not the root of the problem.  Anything can be misused or used in the wrong way....parents just need to spend time and raise their kids right.  How they do it is up to them...as long as they DO IT.  be it with Guns, video games...etc etc blah blah.

Let's get back to buses...
