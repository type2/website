what guage wire did you have running from the alt->isolator->2nd battery?

I've found that the 12 or 14 gauge wire (whatever was recommended) isn't 
cutting it for charging my 2ndary and that I'm occasionally having to 
recharge at home (kinda a pain).  I have been thinking about moving to 10 
ga. but have concerns about overworking my alternator (and the wire coming 
loose).  Then again, i've heard some success stories from people using 10 
ga, so...

thoughts?
