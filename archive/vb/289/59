Subject: Rotating Bus tires

Question for the day, originally our buses came with bias ply tires and the
tire rotation was front to rear, keeping the lefts on the left and rights on
the right.  Nowadays, we mostly are running radials, so do we do the radial
tire rotation moving the rear to the front and the front to the opposite
rear?  Just a curious question to see what some of y'all do.

Thanks
