Amen Brother,

As a 30 year old with two kids under 7, I know the stresses/complaints of the under 48" tall crowd.

In my bus, I have a rolling kids backpack (all the rage now) filled with kids books and activity books. 

I call it the "bus library". The boys love the concept of "bus" attached to anything because they relate it to Dad, and they feel a part of what's going on.

I NEVER hear a word from the backseat, unless it's friendly and amicable and I don't have a TV in my bus.

2 cents,

Billy
