Subject: Re: [VB] compressor size question

18 cfm with a 110v compressor? I don't think this is possible is it? I defer
to the experts.

Can't you _make_ a 220v circuit using 2 110v circuits? Isn't a 220v circuit
just 2 110v hot leads, one going to the hot side and the other 110v going to
the neutral?

Could some one point me to a 115v compressor that can be used to sand &
paint a bus? How much cfm or scfm will I need?  The random oribal sanders
seem to want 10+ cfm (-at-) 90 PSI & someone told me I will need 18+cfm to spray
paint.  I have sapce for large compressor but my landlord will not want to
deal with me if I go asking for 220V to be installed. I just need some
starting point to work with.
thanks in advance
