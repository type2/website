Agreed.  But if the goal is "charge your car battery", it is probably
more cost-effective to do so with grid juice, assuming that the grid
is available.

To put this data in the same table, with the best JC Whipme cell:

 Solar    kWh    Solar cell   Hours the solar cell
 Cell     from   output at    would have to run
 Price    grid   15 V DC      to pay for itself
 $67.99   679.9   0.50 A max  90,700 hours (20.7  years at 12 hrs/day)  JCW
$560.00  5600.0  10.7  A max  35,000 hours ( 7.99 years at 12 hrs/day)  Jim
$640.00  6400.0  10.7  A max  40,000 hours ( 9.13 years at 12 hrs/day)  Jim

8-9 years is probably a better payback time than 20+ years.  And I know
that panels like Jim is talking about will probably have a >15 V output,
but the info is there for battery-charging comparison purposes.

Do you have any data on what their output is now, vs. their rated output?

PVs have always been a fairly good option where there isn't grid.
And there is the idea of renewability, which favors PV.  But as far
as the "solar cell factories don't run on solar cells" idea, there
is some non-trivial amount of hydrocarbon/nuclear energy expended
in the manufacture of the cell, which the cell may or may not be
able to "pay back" over its lifetime.  This is a different payback
than the versus-the-grid one above.  If you could get more energy
back out of the cells during their lifetime than it takes to make
them, then you could run the solar cell factory on solar cells.
The underlying concept is "total lifecycle cost" and it will make
your head spin if you try to calculate it all out.

Bus content: Keeping a Bus rolling can be looked at as squeezing
every last drop out of the energy that went into making it; each
VW's share of those mountains of coal or caverns of gas that were
probably burned to keep the lines humming in Wolfsburg or Hanover
gets pretty tiny when spread out over 25 million VWs and 40 years.
