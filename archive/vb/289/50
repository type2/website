Yes....dealing with unsealed lead-acid batteries can be very hazardous.  I
have 16 of them powering the inverter for my house, and prudently, I wear
goggles, and make sure the path to the garage bathroom is clear when working
in the battery compartment.

Another of the ways to make batteries safer is to understand that those
fumes are hydrogen sulfide, with free hydrogen floating around.  Hindenburg,
anyone?  These fumes increase when charging, and normally, are vented
harmlessly out of the caps and away.  Note:  Hydrogen sulfide is corrosive!
Point is:  Another thing that happens over time when charging, is that you
lose water.  When there is less electrolyte, there is more room for air, or
in this case, hydrogen!  Nice little partially sealed container of highly
flammable gas.  The more space you give it, the more likely it is that an
errant spark can ignite it, and, well, you know!

Keep your electrolyte at the appropriate level!

Ventilate your work area if inside!

And follow Chuck's recommendation, too!
