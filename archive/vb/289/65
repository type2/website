I'm a school teacher & the more I teach the more I'm
concerned about the way my students view film or tv
media.
Part of the course we do for English is Media & Film
Studies and part of the Music curriculum is Music In
The Media(Film, TV & Radio).
The trend I've noticed is that videos become like a
piece of candy.
They're satisfied with each particular movie until
it's over.
Analysis seems to be something that happens to other
things.
Mention replaying the film to get into the nitty
gritty(i.e. characters, themes, plot & directing
techniques) and I'm greeted with loud groans &
complaints.
I find myself dragging them kicking & screaming
through stuff that SHOULD be fun or at least fairly
painless.
Teaching both English & Music I find myself analysing
a lot of factors within a film or TV show and I think
we need to change our entire attitude.
Ask my wife about the way I react to films.
Some people say "Wow, that was a pretty funny line" or
"that leading actress was a good looker".
I say "the way they used total silence in the scene of
the gang shooting and then used Billie Holiday's
"Autumn In New York" as the camera pans across the
dead bodies was rivetting", or "the undercurrents in
the exchange between the main characters in the first
scene were staggering, particularly considering the
cinematography behind them".
Suffice to say, my kids are going to think I'm a pain
in the a$$ ;o)
Between choosing movies for their bus & general VW
content and making my kids analyse "Finding Nemo" for
links with Homer's "Odessey"(the Ancient Greek author,
not Simpson!), they're going to go nuts!
Let's say an in-car DVD could hold new horrors for
them.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
