A fellow member of TIDEWATER TYPE 2 Jason is leaving fron virginia beach
today. Look for his slammed 61 panel on I95. This is his first trip in this
bus. I hope everyone has fun and I wish I was going.

Anyone headed to Tampa this weekend for the Bulli Brigade and Bug Jam?

I am finally going!  Long overdue really.

The bad part is that I will be in a buddys '71 Westi and not my '66 Westi :(

  Thought I would have the new rearend in so I could make it with IRS and 
944 rear discs, but alas no dice.

Maybe next week some cool photos of a completed full 944 brake system.

See ya'll in sunny Tampa,
Adrian Pillow
