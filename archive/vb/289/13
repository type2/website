Subject: RE: [VB] Oil cooler question

If you follow the air flow through the shroud you find that it is
directed through the cooler and down and out through that "scoop" as you
call it away from the engine. The whole idea of the doghouse offset oil
cooler was to get air to the oil cooler but also to cylinder #3 instead
of blasting cylinder #3 with hot air right off the oil cooler as in the
1500 and below engines. That was the major reason for the early demise
of that cylinder and the cracks around #3 in the block. It was also the
reason for deep studding one of the cylinder studs at #3.

But my question is: Does cool air flow
INTO this scoop to cool the oil cooler, or does hot
air flow OUT OF this scoop after it has already passed
throu the oil cooler.  Another way to look at this
question is "Where does cooling air come from right
before it hits the oil cooler??
