I don't know much about how much air you need, but I agree with Kevin
that you probably won't get that much from a 117 V compressor.  Looking
at Campbell Hausfeld's site, the 117 V ones are rated around 5 to 6 SCFM
at 90 PSI.  Only the 234 V ones are rated in excess of 10 CFM at 90 PSI.

Note that many compressor horsepower ratings are against the law, at
least according to this guy:

A Google lead me to http://truetex.com/aircompressors.htm which has
some good info abot compressor ratings.  I didn't know what an SCFM
was before and now I do.

>Can't you _make_ a 220v circuit using 2 110v circuits?

It is possible, but not recommended - it is against the National
Electrical Code in the US.  If somebody was going to die without
234 V, sure, I'd rig it up, but as a regular practice it's not
a good idea.  Also, if "landlord" means an apartment, it's possible
that there isn't any 234 V to be had - it's 208 V or some other
voltage.
