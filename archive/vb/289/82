Subject: Re: [VB] Doghouse stuff was Re: [VB] Oil cooler question

Eric&Barb,
I have a hard time visuallizing how the foam is used. I would think it would
burn, block the air where needed. Sounds like it would be great if done
right. Can you provide pictures or drawings?
Dave

also gluing back on a foam strip on the back of the cooler to help seal and
keep the tin from leaking air.

Hi Ray,
Actually foam rubber is supposed to go all the way over the front/top/rear
sides of the cooler to seal it to the dog house fanshroud forcing the
cooling
air through the fins of the cooler.  Also foam strips on the exhaust shell
to
seal it to the fan shroud.  For both of these areas we use foam strips for
household doors the soft black stuff about 1/2" thick, 1/2-3/4" wide.  One
can get
this in rolls from local hardware stores.
