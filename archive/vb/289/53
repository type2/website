Hi Ray,
Actually foam rubber is supposed to go all the way over the front/top/rear 
sides of the cooler to seal it to the dog house fanshroud forcing the cooling 
air through the fins of the cooler.  Also foam strips on the exhaust shell to 
seal it to the fan shroud.  For both of these areas we use foam strips for 
household doors the soft black stuff about 1/2" thick, 1/2-3/4" wide.  One can get 
this in rolls from local hardware stores.
