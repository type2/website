I guess my point is that when I was a kid the drive to our destination was part of the vacation. Modern cars with all of the TV's , DVD players, GPS and other bells and whistles take away from the adventure of travel itself. I understand they are creature comforts and can make travel with children easier but I see them (gadgets not kids!) as distractions. If you are focusing all of your attention inside the car, think of what you miss outside. 

But I agree it's a personal preference, and that's mine. 

As for bus content, is there a converter that could be used to have the electrical outlet in a bus used for radios ect that would run off of a secondary battery.

TVs and VCRs in the car are not the root of the problem. Anything can be misused or used in the wrong way....parents just need to spend time and raise their kids right. How they do it is up to them...as long as they DO IT. be it with Guns, video games...etc etc blah blah.

Let's get back to buses...
