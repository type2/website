A second battery will do nothing for you while the engine is running.
Actually, a battery by itself is a drain on the alternator, very little, but
the drain is there none the less.

If you need more power for while the engine is running, the alternator needs
to step up. A 75 amp should be enough for whatever anyone wants to throw at
it.  My stock 55 amp alternator keeps up with everything running on my bus,
plus the 10 amp draw of the gas heater.

If you want to be able to run your gas heater and other electronics while
the bus is parked, then a second battery is the way to go. Wire it so that
the electrical components draw from one battery, but the rest of the stuff
runs off the stock battery. That way, you can run the battery dead, but
still be able to start it up to charge it back up. I would recommend a deep
cycle battery for the secondary battery if you plan to use it for something
such as this.
