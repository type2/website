Heck, I still bounce in my seat saying "are we there yet, are we there
yet?", and I have driven all over UTAH and WYOMING.

I guess you haven't driven  up and down, side to side across Nevada or
Wyoming. Heck, even the view from the freeway going down Utah isn't much
to gander at. Open desert. It's only good to look at for a while before
it becomes incredibly boring.
