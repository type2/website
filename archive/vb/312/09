Subject: anaheim to bakersfield on march 28

Hi All,

 

I will find myself in Anaheim for a conference from the 27th through the
31st of march.  I see the only vw event anywhere near there is the show
in Bakersfield on the 28th (Sunday).

 

Is anyone going to that event that I could bum a ride with?

 

 

 

TIA

 


David
