Subject: RE: [VB] Tuning dual carbs

About a half a zillion years ago when it became unsafe to use the old
upright mercury vacuum monometers I went to Using an inexpensive
motorcycle dual carb vacuum gauge, (which is what is still on my engine
startup stand), and in 1987 purchased a set up vac gauges that would sit
on top of my carbs that didn't have vacuum ports. J.C. Whitney sells the
BugPack brand, two different types. Below is what they currently list
and I have a set of both but like the tower type the best.

Can anyone direct me to good reference materials for learning to tune my
dual Delorto DLRA 36 carburetors?  I heard I would need a device called
a Uni-Syn (?).

Thanks in advance
