Weapons of Mass Distraction

OBC:
Took the recently refurbed Fleetline panel on its first road
trip the other weekend. We did a 500km round trip to Welkom,
where Gisela's parents live, to pick up some furniture.

Bus performed wonderfully, and didn't seem to notice the
load on the return trip.

On the way back, though, just after sunset, the accelerator
cable broke and, unusually for me, we were carrying NO tools
or parts. I managed to rig up a working repair using my
Swiss army knife and a small spring I found on the parcel
tray. Got the bus running just as it got too dark to see
underneath.

Back in Jo'burg I went in search of a new cable, but no one
had stock, and the manufacturers have it on back order. So I
made a more permanent repair with wire. Been running the bus
with the jury-rigged wire repair ever since.

I'm not sure if I'll bother to replace it with a new one.
The ones they make nowadays are of braided cable, not like
the originals made of a single strand of strong wire. The
braided ones break at least once a year, while the wire ones
last almost forever.

I have owned this bus since 1993 and have driven it
96,000km, and this is only the second time I have had an
accelerator cable break.
