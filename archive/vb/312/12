Printed it at home.

How much
>did this set you back?

Cost about 4 bucks, laminated.  Chose the 12 X 15 size because it would 
still easily fit on the back of the kick panel.  Doing the text portion 
separately so I won't have to keep flipping it 90 degrees every couple of 
seconds, about 4"X8".  Was thinking of blowing up the fuse panel and the 
turnsignal switch  sections and putting them on the back.
It's make me a little less apprehensive about the neurosurgury.
