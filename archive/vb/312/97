Billy?

Sorry gentlemen, I was eating taco's and cruising vintagebus at the right time.

The white-over-pastel green '65 has been nominated.

I know Pelco is a security equipment company, don't know much about the shoot. It will be Wednesday, this week, about 10 miles east of Fresno.

Anybody wanna hook up after for a beverage? The shoot will be over about 5pm.

Billy
