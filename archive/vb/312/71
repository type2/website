call Ronnie at Type2parts.com
he wont sell you anything he wont put in his own bus and drive across the 
country! i just tried to tell my friend about him, and he is insisting on 
buying a GEX motor because they have a 3 year warranty. reminds me of the 
movie Tommy Boy where he says he can take a crap in a box and slap a 
warranty on it, but does that make it a good part :-)
