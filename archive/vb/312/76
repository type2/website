Subject: Fuse panel

Second attempt at posting this, so...
Laying everything out today realised that my Wireworks 58-63 harness is made 
for a 8 fuse panel, so this is what i came up with.

The 8 fuse is from left to right, three pairs and two singles, with the left 
and right headlights being on seperate pairs.  the 6 fuse is from left to 
right two singles and two pairs with the headlights both being on one pair.  
What I was going to do is wire acording to the diagram (62-65, Vintage bus), 
with the two single fuses wired the same and the headlights both wired on 
one paired fuse
Will this work?
