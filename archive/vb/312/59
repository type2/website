Subject: Heater box repair pipe

Seems like I remember a post about this but there is no reference to it in the
archives.

I think I remember someone posting a message that using the repair pipes on
the heat exchanger tips when they rust out was a bad idea. Anybody remember
anything like this?

Mine are toast and I'm thinking about using the repair pipe rather than
getting new heat exchangers.
