Subject: Press bumper brackets.  How are they different??

Never owned a press bumper buss.  (Post BD) Can any
tell me how the rear bumper brackets differ from the
later units?  I am specifically interested in the area
where they mount to the frame, not the area that
mounts the bumper.

I want to find out if a westy hitch can use the mount
points at the bumper bracket.

Thanks for the help.
