Subject: RE: [VB] Heater box repair pipe

The heater box pipes usually rust out in a ridge around where the donut
and clamp ride. This area is exposed to the elements and is heated and
cooled all the time accelerating the rusting process. Hack sawing off
the rusted piece and hammering in the new repair pipe will usually give
you one more engine rebuild life out of your boxes before they end up in
the refuse too. Along that same line, check out the sheet metal around
the boxes for rust outs. I have successfully repaired and extend the
life of a lot of boxes by brazing chunks of coffee can over the rusted
out areas with a small torch.

Seems like I remember a post about this but there is no reference to it
in the archives.

I think I remember someone posting a message that using the repair pipes
on the heat exchanger tips when they rust out was a bad idea. Anybody
remember anything like this?

Mine are toast and I'm thinking about using the repair pipe rather than
getting new heat exchangers.
