It's my first post here, but some information needs to
be interjected:

Here is the 'truth.'

You don't hurt, moreover and especially, 'big oil' by
doing this. You affect your local jobber/dealer/mom n'
pop. The only way to hurt 'big oil' is to not buy
their stock. (or sue them, worked for Unocal in '96 ..
details, if you ask ...) It can be summed up in one
word:

Incest.

I work for 'big oil.' And ideas such as boycott of
brand are not 'that' simple. I DO produce gasoline for
Exxon and Mobil, but I do NOT work for either company.

So, in a sense, you're hurting me and I didn't have
anything to do with the Exxon Valdez. (by the same
token, I am not stating you should run out and
purchase their products either ...)

It goes like this:

Crude is bought from storage at Chevron/Texaco.
The crude gets run at Tesoro (Shell) into gasoil and
is sold.
The gasoil gets run at Valero into gasoline stock and
is sold.
The gasoline stock gets blended at a Union 76 terminal
and is sold.
The gasoline goes into your tank from the local
'Shamrock/mom 'n pop/jobber' dealer.

But for the last item, 'shell game' the names around
and you get the idea. The only other way to hurt big
oil, is to not buy their products, period. 

Don't use oil. At all. Simple as that. 

They are all in this together. Big oil is out of the
branded market/station owning game. Only a handful of
stations are actually owned by the major companies.

Stations are owned by people like you and me. 

The impact you have, is on your local economy. Sorry
man, that's just how it works. I make gasoline for six
different branded stations in two countries and I only
work for one company.

And that's the 'truth.'

Bus context!

I am disassembling my 8335 South Wind gas heater
tomorrow! Using the guide graciously provided by Rick
Taylor ... this is turning out to be quite a chore and
most everything on the heater is complete!

Cheers!
