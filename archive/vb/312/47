You could always slide into a wrecking yard that has pickups with dual
tanks and salvage the mechanical valves.

Is there a 6V version of this? How does this work exactly...ie if your
battery is dead or disconnected-does the fuel flow? Or does it need to
have a battery connected for the fuel to flow?
