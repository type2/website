Subject: Re: [VB] Press bumper brackets.  How are they different??

rear brackets.... well I'd say they fit the inside of the bumper, which is a 
different shape. So you can't use the 55-58 bracket on your 59-67 bumper or 
vice versa.  But the shape of the bus where they bolt on is the same.    I mean, 
you could bolt a 59-67 later bumper to your say, 56 bus.  or even a 68-71 
rear bumper, which has yet again different brackets.  72 bumper (with 72 only 
brackets) has the brackets spaced wider apart (wider motor I guess) and won't fit 
on yr earlier bus.

Never owned a press bumper buss.  (Post BD) Can any
tell me how the rear bumper brackets differ from the
later units?  I am specifically interested in the area
where they mount to the frame, not the area that
mounts the bumper.

I want to find out if a westy hitch can use the mount
points at the bumper bracket.

Thanks for the help.
