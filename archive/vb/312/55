The reserve cable knob is to the right of the heater knob behind and to the 
right of the drivers legs.  Normally the knob is pushed all the way in (on).    
when you are driving along and the bus starts to choke from lack of gas, lean 
over and pull the knob out all the way (reserve),   bus keeps going... it now 
has about a gallon left 

For pulling the motor or changing fuel line, pull the knob halfway out (off) 
.  no drips!!!

at least that's how it works on my 61

Before I rebuildt the tap w/ WW kit it did drip when at 'off'

In my 53, when it chokes out from lack of gas, I have to pull over, open the 
engine lid, and turn the switch on the fuel tap located under the tank, which 
is to the left and above the engine.    It's more convenient with a cable up 
to the front.


59 I used to have, for some reason the reserve would kick in at half a tank.  
I guess the "on" tube was taller than it should have been.

How do you use the fuel reserve tap to shut off the gas when pulling the
engine? Is it a 3 way valve, 1 setting for normal operation, 1 setting for
reserve and 1 setting for off?
