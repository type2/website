The "white-trash" way to do it is to print it out over a bunch of pages, 
line 'em up with each other, then tape the whole thing together with clear 
packing tape. Cover all the paper on the front and back. Ain't the 
prettiest, but gets it big where you can tack it on the wall on a Sunday 
afternoon when your trying to figure out the wiring on a POS '61 double cab.

I noticed the local Office Depot has a copy center with one of those big 
plotter printers. One of these days I'm gonna throw the file on disc and 
take it down there and see what they can do.
