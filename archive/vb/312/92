I drove my double cab for a month or so with a piece of monofilament 
fishing line tied to the throttle arm, out the engine compartment lid, over 
the top of the tailgate and in the window right behind my left 
shoulder.  Pull string to go faster, let go to go slower....

This had the disadvantage of making me drive with one hand off the wheel 
all the time, making shifting a bit dodgy, but the stretchyness of the line 
prevented those jackrabbit starts.
