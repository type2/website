And I thought I was living on the edge driving my DC from CA. To Utah w/ the
accelerator pedal duct taped to the floor mat.  Had to use my big toe to
return the pedal, which meant no shoe & it was 15-20 degrees outside!

Tom Buese-drove the DC for the 1st time in a long time yesterday in 50 deg.
Weather-sweet!
