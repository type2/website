Subject: Blinking yellow light leads to Engine meltdown - 

Long story:
1. put new fan belt on - too loose
2. Blinking yellow light
3. bought another fan belt 2 days ago.
4. Engine overheats before I can get it on....

OK, I now have to figure out how to tow a lowered bus
and where to get an engine. (-at-)#$*((-at-)&#^$)*^. 

I need to get the car back on the road whithin about a
week, so I figure - new engine. Where and how much $
would you recommend? I know local shops do much custom
work, but I just want a reliable standard 1600 DP
engine like I had...
