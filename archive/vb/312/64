Subject: Clutch pedal removal

Hey all, 

   I got a '67 that has a sticky clutch pedal.  I'm pretty sure that what I need to do is clean up and grease the pivot and pivot bushing under the pedal.

   Does anyone have a trick to push out the pivot?  I think I might need to make a special tool to get the leverage I need to push the pivot out.  There's no room for a drift and hammer.

   Any help would be appreciated.

THANKS
