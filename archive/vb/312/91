Hi,

www.everybus.com

The 6th annual EveryBus starts 4.15.04 in Greensboro, NC. For those 
of you not familiar with event, EveryBus is one of the largest and 
most fun family VW Bius, Vanagon and Eurovan camping events in North 
America.

I have been working most of the day to get the site updated. Please 
make sure you visit the events page, kids activities and the CARABUS 
page.

If you are planning to attend please sign up for the CARABUS list. If 
you have a page for your Bus, Vanagon or EuroVan  or pics I will have 
them linked or hosted from everybus.com. The CARABUS list is a great 
way to plan your trip and know who is who when you get there!

Once again we will be having the chilli cooking contest and pot luck 
supper on Saturday as well as kids activities and a special event put 
on by the Canadians, the Trouble Shooting Time Trials. FUN FUN FUN!

I hope that you can attend and have a wonderful time. If you have any 
questions that are not answered by the web site please feel free to 
contact me at everybus(-at-)mindspring.com.

Once agian the web site is www.everybus.com

Thanks
