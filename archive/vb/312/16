Subject: Rear Axle Nut

I just got this catalog from "Parts Place Inc., for all Volkswagens"
They have this tool in there for removing rear axle nuts, part number
VW-120-614-6, 46MM for a bus or vanagon. 

"Guaranteed to do it every time even if it was installed by a 800# gorilla.
Just remove the cotter pin, put tool on have your buddy press down with a
breaker bar while you strike the tool with a 10# hammer"

Anyone ever try one of these, or seen them? Also didn't we just determine
that the actual size was 41mm or 1 10/16"? Maybe this is for newer buses?
