Subject: re:fuel shut off valve

It looks like the part you are referring to is 

VWC-211-209-021-D (according to cip1)

Or 

211209021A (according to WW)

Or is it 

211209021E (according to WW)...

Which one...

If I got one of these I think I would just want to use it to shut off the
fuel(during storage, security, working on the engine...etc) and not as a
reserve switch. So...I should get one of these, and next time the fuel is
low in the tank and I have some time I should install one of these. 

How hard are they to install, do you need to remove the gas tank? Special
sealants needed? Other suggestions...?
