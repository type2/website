Subject: magnet into tank (was bus stalling)

I got a horseshoe shaped magnet a couple days ago, it had a hole in it. Then
I took a metal shirt hanger, attached it to the end, and stuck it down the
tank.moved it around a bit, then pulled it out. Not much on the magnet, just
a couple tiny grains of something or other.
