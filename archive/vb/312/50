Subject: Re: [VB] re:fuel shut off valve

How do you use the fuel reserve tap to shut off the gas when pulling the
engine? Is it a 3 way valve, 1 setting for normal operation, 1 setting for
reserve and 1 setting for off?

You really should just consider the stock VW fuel shut off.  It mounts in
the
outlet of the fuel tank, so when replacing flex fuel line there is "0"
inches
of fuel line before the valve to replace!  Also if you take a look at the
front seat there still is the bump under the seat for installing a reserve
fuel
switch cable.  If you do not want to install the cable the reserve switch
can
be still used and switched by hand under the bus.
