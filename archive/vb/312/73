Hi Raymond,
Give Butch at Bear's VW machine at 619-691-8385 a call.  Check the archives 
for more info there under "Butch" or "Bear's VW Machine".  We went with the 
1641cc CW SP DR engine and love how smooth it is.  Last we heard cost was about 
$1100.00, and well worth it.  Without the vibration a normal cranked engine has 
there is a bit more power to the wheels, quieter and alot less fatigueing 
driving.  Butch also can rebuild or on new SP heads install exhaust valves with 
thicker stems.  Which keeps these valves cooler with less tendancy to stretch 
and snap off as happens all too often to #3 cylinder.
Please tell Butch "Eric&Barb" said "Hi!".
