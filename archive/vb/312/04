Subject: Laminated diagram

Girding my loins in preparation of replacing the wiring harness, took a 
color diagram from Vintagebus, went to Staples with it, had it blown up to 
approx 12"x15" and laminated.  Wont get greasy or wrinkled, easy to read, 
and will fit behind my passenger's kickpanel when done.  As Martha says, 
"It's a good thing."  Wife's idea, actually.
