Sounds like it's time to start rounding up a few more dynamited bug or
bus trannys and cutting the bell housing off. I used to do that for the
VolksAir and hover craft motors. Just takes about twenty minutes with a
Saws All on a drained tranny.

Anyone want to hold the starter motor against the engine for me? Hi Cal,
Or use a bell housing from a 1972-79 tranny to mount the starter without
a
complete tranny needed!
