Subject: Fuel shut of valve

I know someone was talking about this not long ago,
did someone post a supplier where we can buy an inline
fuel line cut off valve?
I am in the process of installing a gas heater in the
bus, and I would love to put one of these on, so if
the thing ever did catch fire, I could turn off the
supply so as not to have a full tank of gas poured on it!
