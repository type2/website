Subject: Re: [VB] Rear Axle Nut

Ya, those are useful, much cheaper than a proper 3/4" slider bar and 46mm 
socket, take up less space in the bus, but I wonder about the effect the smashing 
has on the bearings.  then again I probably use it wrong, as usually there 
isn't a buddy around to lean on the breakerbar  while I whack the whacker tool. 
I have them in 46mm and 36mm sizes, found in old buses under the seat.

yes the big axle nut is 46mm, holds the drum to the stub axle.   the inner 
stub axle nut is smaller (only about 41mm) and holds the stub axle onto the 
RGBox.

I just got this catalog from "Parts Place Inc., for all Volkswagens"
They have this tool in there for removing rear axle nuts, part number
VW-120-614-6, 46MM for a bus or vanagon. 

"Guaranteed to do it every time even if it was installed by a 800# gorilla.
Just remove the cotter pin, put tool on have your buddy press down with a
breaker bar while you strike the tool with a 10# hammer"

Anyone ever try one of these, or seen them? Also didn't we just determine
that the actual size was 41mm or 1 10/16"? Maybe this is for newer buses?
