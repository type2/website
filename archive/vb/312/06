Hi Cal,
If you removed the fan belt and the whining noise was still there.  Then it 
must be internal in the engine, clutch or tranny.  We doubt the main or rod 
bearings would ever make such a noise.  Could be a broken piston ring.  Probably 
best step next is to remove engine and setup so you can start it outside of 
your VW.  If the noise goes away it is not the engine then.
