Subject: RE: [VB] Rear Axle Nut

 A few things.

Parts place SUCKS A$$.Great place if you like paying more than list price
for things.

The 41mm nut is on the inside of the RGB not to be confused with the outer
axle nut which is either 46mm or 36mm.

You can get this from anyone stocking BugPack and I think Lisle Tools made
one too.

It is a tool of last resort for REMOVING the nuts not installing them.

Lastly PartsPlace inc./Jack Finn SUCKS A$$.

If I sound bitter your right.I worked there about 20 years ago and that guy
still pisses me off.

I just got this catalog from "Parts Place Inc., for all Volkswagens"
They have this tool in there for removing rear axle nuts, part number
VW-120-614-6, 46MM for a bus or vanagon.

"Guaranteed to do it every time even if it was installed by a 800# gorilla.
Just remove the cotter pin, put tool on have your buddy press down with a
breaker bar while you strike the tool with a 10# hammer"

Anyone ever try one of these, or seen them? Also didn't we just determine
that the actual size was 41mm or 1 10/16"? Maybe this is for newer buses?
