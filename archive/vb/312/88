Do you mean the large thick washer type thing, the one with the chamfered 
hole in the middle so it's supposed to go on a certain way out?

211 501 281 B? (for big nut RGBs)

what page in the Bentley were you looking at?   pics?

I 'm almost ready to install the transaxle assembly in my '63, however I just

were no spacers.  
  Any ideas?  If I need these spacers, does anyone have a set they will sell 
to me?  I would hate to put this back together to find that I missed something 
that was screwed up by the PO.  I don't know if it makes a difference, but 
these are the big nut RGB's.

Thanks in advance,
Matt
