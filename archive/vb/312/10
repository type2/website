Subject: RE: [VB] Laminated diagram

   James wrote Girding my loins in preparation of replacing the wiring 
harness,
   took a color diagram from Vintagebus, went to Staples with it, had
   it blown up to approx 12"x15" and laminated.  Wont get greasy or
   wrinkled, easy to read, and will fit behind my passenger's kickpanel
   when done.  As Martha says, "It's a good thing."  Wife's idea,
   actually.

James did you just print it out at home or take it on disc? How much did 
this set you back? Great Idea!
