Subject: RE: [VB] Help Getting rear drum off?

Sounds like your brake shoes have made a ridge/groove in your brake drum.  
Have you turned your adjusters all of the way in?  Second option would be to 
heat the drum snout around the shaft with the puller applying pressure. BF 
hammer drum inward towards the axle seal to try and get things broke loose.  
Dont get too carried away though.  Last and most creative option, clean all 
oily residue from drum that you can, and soak entire brake in vineger.  It's 
a pretty mild acid and reportedly does a decent job of derusting.  
Unsweetened koolaid is supposed to do the same.  I'm impatient and use 
muratic acid, but if it gets ahold of any aluminum it will get way too 
happy.
