Subject: The Split Bus Club (Calif.)--anyone know if this group is still

Sorry to bother everyone who's not interested, but I've been trying without 
success to find a contact for this group. They used to organize a campout 
at Dillon Beach, but the original organizers of that event are not longer 
involved.

Can anyone here point me in the right direction?
