Subject: Keep the lists alive

Hi Volks- the treasurer here. It is time for a fundraising drive for the
Type2/Vintagebus mailing lists. We have 4 months of operating funds left
($659.00 ) in the bank. Our finances are very simple. Bandwidth is $150.00
per month (payable to (-at-)Lasta. Net) and bank charges of $12.00 per month.

The Type2/Vintagebus lists have been free for the whole world since 1994. We
do not accept advertising (but gladly accept DONATIONS from vendors). Our
purpose is to provide knowledge and support to the air-cooled VW BUS
community. They lists provide a library and archives, whose information is
freely disseminated thru links to other VW Sites. The lists started and
maintain the AIRES   list, a nation-wide help system for VW Bus drivers.

It's easy to donate. Go to http://www.type2.com/donate.html  to use paypal,
or if you want to send a check, please send to:
