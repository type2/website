Subject: Re: [VB] Running hot

Is it running hot on the street or on the highway? Or both? The small nut is 
1.38:1 the big nut is 1.26:1? At any rate the small nut RGB's are a lower 
gear ratio =  higher highway revs.

You can't see a fan belt slip, just make sure that the belt tension is good.

You say you have the dog house cooler. Did you get the wider fan to go with 
it?

 I think it's running hot because the dip stick and distributor are burning 
me when I touch them.  I haven't had one burn that hot before.

 I am running a new rancho freeway flyer tranny with rebuilt small nut 
reduction boxes

 I do have a dog house system

 haven't noticed my my fan belt slipping.  I think I am tuned well.

 I had it tuned at reputable aircooled only shop.

 Any idea's?  Do you know the gearing difference in the small nut verses big 
nut Reduction boxes


 Thanks for the help!
