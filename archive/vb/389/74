Subject: ADMIN: Mailing lists are back up

Listees,

The VintageBus and Type2 mailing lists, as well as the www.type2.com
and www.vintagebus.com web sites, are back up.  The server was
installed and brought up early this morning and all seems to be well.

The mailing lists should work immediately.  If you have any trouble
accessing the www.type2.com or www.vintagebus.com Web sites, the first
thing you should do is try it again in a few hours.  It takes a while
for the entire net to learn that www.type2.com has moved.  (Our new
IP address is  64.122.7.63 ).  If you're still having trouble after,
say, Tuesday evening, contact me offlist at mattroberds(-at-)cox.net .

The server is installed at the Integra hosting facility in Seattle.
This is a similar setup to the facility in San Diego, where the server
was able to run continuously for 960 days, 16 hours, and 2 minutes.

Again, contact me offlist at mattroberds(-at-)cox.net if you have any
questions.

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
One of the type2.com admins
