Subject: Remember this bus one year ago?

Hi,

You may remember that I bought a bus from a guy called Victor Cardona in 
VA last year with the help of Steve Dolan, - thanks dude.

I've spent a lot of time on the bus and it's nearly finished.  Just came 
out of the pain shop a few weeks ago. Subtly lowered on fuch style rims, 
chrome bumpers, deluxe trim etc.

Just thought I'd share,  so you know that not all exported buses are 
just sold on : )

We've had several good camping trips in the bus with our baby and it's 
been great, and only off the road for the four weeks it was in the paint 
shop.
