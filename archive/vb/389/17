Hi Isaac,
Stalling while idling sounds like carb needs cleaning.  Stalling while  going 
around a bend could be carb again or electrical problem.
  Have you been oiling the distributor under the rotor a drop or two  every 
tuneup?  When you twist the rotor does it easily turn one  direction and spring 
back?
