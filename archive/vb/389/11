Subject: Backfiring through the carb HELP!!!!

Alright I know there was a post on this a while back but I cannot find it.
So here is what I got, a 1600 sp with a pretty new 30-32 Pict Solex Carb, I
was doing my regular oil change last night and noticed that there was quite
a bit of a rich smelling oily substance ooozing from my carb. so I pulled it
and upon further inspection I found that the Air cleaner was goooy with oil
and the auto-choke was pretty gummed up so I cleaned the heck out of the
carb and stuffed it back in, but this morning she stalled 6 times while
backfiring like crazy. But now she is purrring like a kitten. When I get the
RPM's up and shift up there is a small back fire through the carb it almost
always happens from 2nd to 3rd so i think the stuff from inside the
cylinders is making its way into my carb when it backfires. One last thing
the engine occasionaly stalls when it backfires through the carb. I just had
a tune up by this guy that has wrenched on VW's for 25 years, owns a shop in
town and the valves were adjusted about 100 miles ago.I drive her every day
to work and on the weekends I drive 70miles to LA and back not to mention at
least one big road trip a month so in the grand scheme of things she is very
reliable, but I am starting to get a bit worried. Any help would be greatly
appreciated.
