I need a vw kombi for a photo shoot next Tuesday in Long Island, New York.
I don't want to buy it, but I could pay someone $1000 and put them up in a
hotel for a night or two if they are interested?

 

It doesn't have to be in mint condition, but should be nice.....

 

Let me know if I could contact anyone, or forward this email to anyone and
have them contact me with photos if they are interested
