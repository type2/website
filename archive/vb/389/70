Our new address should be 64.122.7.63 .  Again, the DNS records will
be updated as needed, so 99.9% of you won't need this information -
the change will be transparent.

At this time we (the admins) haven't contemplated using the "backup"
group on Yahoo! Groups, mostly because the outage is (planned to be)
relatively short.  If it turns into a long outage for some reason, we
may turn that group back on.  If this happens, we will email the Type2
and VintageBus subscribers to let them know; we've got copies of the
subscriber lists so we can do this manually.

Again, contact me offlist at mattroberds(-at-)cox.net if you have any
questions.

Thanks!
