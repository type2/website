Subject: Re: [VB] Running hot

Hi,

How do you know that it is running hot? 
Burned oil? 
Smell? 
Finger on the dip stick? 
thermometer down the dip stick hole?
Is it hot running around town? or on the highway?

Is it running rich?
Is it running lean?
Is your fan belt slipping?
Is it a dog house system?
Big nut or small nut tranee?
