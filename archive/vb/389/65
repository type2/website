Greg,

I didn't read all the last posts that carefully. Did you check your timing? 
Did you read your plugs? White = too lean causes overheating. Grey = just 
about right. Black = too rich carbon build up can cause overheating.  Also a 
wide fan and dog house tin are said to help. I have a porsche pulley on my 
alternator.
