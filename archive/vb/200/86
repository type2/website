Subject: Re:Bus Shifter Differences

  VW also changed the size of the shifter ball in late '50 or early '60. I had 
to send back my Berg shifter because of this (I hear they aren't making the 
early style anymore btw.)
  If your bus is before that change it will not fit without changing it or the 
receiving socket thing-a-ma-jig (sorry). I forgit what chassis # this change 
started at.
