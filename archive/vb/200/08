In a message dated 1/5/2003 5:32:04 PM Pacific Standard Time, 
my 65 has a 3.88 r&p, and big nut (1.26 )boxes a bus 4th and it does 3K at 
60mph, at 70mph it is 3500rpm.    I have a mystery origion 1600 dp in it 
right now, and the thing is if you are using a 1600 motor this gearing is too 
high.  I mean, it moves the bus, but doesn't have the zip.   I started 
building a 1679 for it (short blocks finally together)

 Any sugeestions on  gearing./ One tranny rebuilder suggested a 3:08 another
 sugessted 3:88. We just want to cruise 70 without the
 RPM's maxing out. (I do not know if the bus has a 44mm or 39mm nut)
