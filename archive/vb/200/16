Subject: Ride Height Question

I recently un-lowered my double cab.  The front was
lowere by way of pulling springs, and the rear was
via a homemade kit.  I set the rear according to the bentley,
and put springs from another beam in the front.    I
installed and engine this weekend and drove it around (whohoo!)

The only problem is the ride height looks kinda wacky. The
back end seems like it sags a bit; either that or the front is
too high.  At first i thought maybe I didn't have the rear
bar adjusted high enough, but I have a slight amount of 
positive camber at rest, so I think I'm close to being correct,
if not spot-on, because if I raised it any higher, I'd have
*more* positive camber.   I also don't have rear shocks
installed yet - I'll probably do that tonight.

The only thing I can think of is that I need to give the
new front springs time to 'settle'.  I can't think of any 
other reason for the high front end/low back end.

Any other ideas?
