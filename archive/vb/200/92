Subject: RE: [VB] what now?

Just as a casual observer to what has been said in the group so far, I would
think that the following would be first objectives:
1) shift linkage, front to back
2) clutch cable
3) throttle cable
4) heater cables
5) tranny mounts and ground strap
6) voltage regulator and wiring
7) fuel line
8) engine compartment seal

That would be some of my first choices

67 Single Cab, DP 1641cc 34PICT-3
71 Trike 1776cc 28/36  Pinto Progressive
VolksAir 1585cc 28 PICT

Bernoulli Interval: Do I really have enough data to draw a valid conclusion ?

I am having my son's transaxle pulled, shipped and rebuilt. My question is
Is there anything I can or should look to fix/replace/rebuilt now that the
engine and transaxle is going to be out for a few weeks? The only thing I
can think of is pulling and getting the gas tank checked out. I have seen
what I think is rust particles in the fuel filter.
Thanks for any suggestions!
