Look at pages H-9 2 and H-9 3 of the '63-'67 Bentley.  Also note that
the "'60-'65" style actually persisted through the early 1966 models,
until approximately 15 September 1965.

Yes.  The shift rod under the Bus is also supported differently.

You'd probably need to get the later-style front shift rod and weld
on the support for it under the Bus.

Note that the Bentley says "Parts of previous type will still be
supplied as replacements."  Usually this means you can't interchange
the old and the new.  If you can, it will usually have a note to that
effect along with "parts of previous type will no longer be supplied."
