Subject: Type 4 duel Kadron kits

   They are here, after months of waiting, EMPI has finally released the
duel Kadron kit for type 4 engines. I have NOT seen or tested these
personally yet so have nothing to say about them. I did build a kit using
aftermarket components on a 2 litre and after a little tuning they worked
great. The retail price is arounf 469 dollars, hopefully this will drop as
it seems a little high to me .
  On another note, CB Performance also has a NEW duel 34 pict 3 kit
available real soon, they have all the components there just need to kit
them up and figure out a price, great for type 4's with electric CHOKES! I
will have one of these on the way for testing on a 1.8 litre engine I have.
Projected price around 350 dollars.
