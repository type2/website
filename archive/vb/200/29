By "clicks" do you mean splines?  I so, one spline would be around nine
degrees, a heck of a jump!  Much finer adjustments can be made by moving
the bar one spline in one direction on one end and one spline in the other
direction at the other end.

Bars do develop a "set" which is why you never switch sides with them, but
once they settle they tend to stay that way for a very long time.  Heating
springs for lowering is done with coil springs by hack "customizers".
Since VWs have built-in adjustment splines, and you would have to pull
the bars out anyway to heat them, even the densest customizer would not
be likely to resort to heating VW springs.
