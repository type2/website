Subject: Re: [VB] Ride Height.

I know that this ride height discussion is focused on the rear torsion 
bars but I do have experience in flipping around and turning upside down 
the front torsion springs on my '67 bus.  I hoped that this might 
increase the ride height in the front.  It made no difference.  Yes, 
rear bars are very different but I do not think that they learn a new 
orientation in any direction.  I do think that they get a bit weaker 
with age and use though????
