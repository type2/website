Subject: Bad Camberg rumor mill...

Hi all,

The rumor mill is churning away in Europe this morning and I just got a
message from Bob at BBT in Belgium.  He says that fairly reliable sources say
that Michael Lottermann, brother of the late "Willi" and uncle to Marcus, may
take over the organization of the 2003 Bad Camberg event near Frankfurt so
that it can continue.  The rumor says that a web site will be up soon about
the event, and that there may be more regulation of the Vintage VW's
(including Busses) allowed onto the site (they were overwhelmed by 10am last
time).

Again, this is only an un-confirmed rumor, but my hopes are once again up for
being able to attend the best Vintage VW event on the planet!  If I hear any
updates, I'll pass them along.  I hope that I will be breaking into my piggy
bank for another Vintage VW adventure.

Fingers crossed,

Bill Bowman
