I got the same email here it is............

"Unofficial news told me trough the grapevine that the brother of Willi
Lottermann, Herr Michakl Lottermann who is Uncle of Marcus  will take over
the organisation of the show Bad Camberg 2003, there will be a website
coming availble in the upcoming weeks.... The cars will be limited and
therefore there will be closer restrictions to busses and the like.

So if everything goes well Bad Camberg will goes on this year, so all our
wishes have not been for nothing!

This is all I do know at this moment, for more news, plse stay tuned, I
mailed it as received!

Keep your fingers crossed!"
