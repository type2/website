Thom, et al,

Steel springs do not 'settle' unless they are overstressed and the metal
deforms (elastic limit is exceeded). I would think that the VW engineers
designed the torsion bars to take infinite life (or close to it), so you
should be able to bottom out either the front or rear without exceeding the
elastic limit, therefore sag should not happen. (Theory is nice until
reality sets in. What a concept.)

George, do you have any thoughts on this?
