Barring personal emergency or mechanical failure I'll be sharing a cold
one with you Jim. Hasn't been that cold here but I'm still ready to soak
up the sun in Havasu while watching you Sumo wrestle. I've got my
turbo heater hooked up and snaked over the front seat, just need to get the
wheels on the wheelie bars.  It will be a good thing to see the Ellis
family again as well as all you other folks that make Arizona good to
visit.
