Thom,

If you clean out the gun every 20 minutes or so, with POR solvent, as
you're working, you can keep the spray gun in good condition, and thus buy
a decent quality unit. POR gets everywhere, and you must wear an aspirator
with solvent filters, plus I suggest goggles and a hat for your hair.

Good luck!
