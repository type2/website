Tom-

While its down you want to change all of our shifter bushing and coupler while the trans is out since the rear tube bushings can
only be changed while the trans is out. You also might consider changing parking brake cables, throttle cable and clutch cables.
Keep the old cables as back ups in the van. Don't forget also to the shifter and cable boots. New trans mounts (stock rubber front
and rear) and engine bay seals would be good also. Check your battery cable to the starter and add a ground cable down to the
starter (always a good thing for reliability). The last thing I can think of would be swing arm bushings. They rarely go bad but
since your down this far with time to kill I would. Just make sure that you mark the spline if you do so it goes back together same
angle. Don't pull the torsion bar out of the housing or you get to reindex your spring plate angles (the latest big topic here).
Allot of little things but well worth the time and expense in the long run for peace of mind and driving pleasure.
