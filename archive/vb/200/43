First we have to know what type of voltage dropping unit you have.

There are a couple of types.
One is a big resistor that you put in series with the load (do not use 
these with a radio)

the other is a voltage regulator device.
These usually have three wires.
Voltage IN  (+12V)   (wires are usually red)
Ground  (wires are usually black)
Voltage OUT (+6V)   (wires are sometimes white)

The wire colors could all change depending upon who made the unit.

Does it have markings on it or the circuit board at all?
What color are the wires?
Can you take a photo of it and pmail it to me? (not to the list)
