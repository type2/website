Subject: Vibrating Repro Elephant Mirrors

Don't go there.....

Serious bus topic here!

Anyway, this summer I tackled this problem and at least minimized the
vibration of my Elephant ear repros on the old camper.

Taking the mirror rubber moulding off to clean, I had the mirror fall to the
ground and break. Not a problem to replace as only $8 (Cdn), and it turned
out to be held in place by 4 strips of two sided tape that had dried out.

Seizing the oppourtunity, I took the chrome elephant mirror base off the
mirror arm and noticed that the "ball" mount assembly is actually attached
rivet style to the mirror base. My mirrors weren't vibrating as much as they
were flopping around while driving, and the "rivet" attachment was visibly
loose as originally put together by the repro manufacturer. So I took the
mirror base and had my son hold it in the bench vice, while I flattened the
offending rivet further with the ball peen hammer for a tighter fit.
Reassembled with new mirror, and now I have minor vibration while on the
highway. Big improvement!!

I believe the original  elephant mirror bases were thicker. So I may try a
thin sound dampening film covering the inside of the mirror base this Spring
and reinstall the mirror to see if this removes this minor vibration
completely.

Any other solutions out there.....
