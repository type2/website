George,
This sounds about right for 3.88.  Mine does 80 at 3800 I believe with
215/15 rears.  Speedo agrees with the "your speed is" signs around
construction sites in NM and AZ.  I have 195 14s in front that should
agree pretty close to stock.  I'll have to assume the tach is right
though.  I think 75 is 3500 on mine.  The 71s had a pretty short R&P
didn't they?
John
