When I first got my DC, it sat somewhat low and I checked the adjustment 
ala bentley also.  Got the degreed level out and went to town.  It still 
seemed to sit somewhat low.  I think I went back and added one or two 
"clicks" and was happy with it.
It seemed weird since I would almost expect it to sit higher since there is 
less metal back there compared to a bus.

I did come across a lowering web page once where they were messing with the 
rear torsion bars.  I vaguely remember something about heating the bars or 
something to allow them to droop more.  I also wonder if with age, these 
bars develop a slight twist to them?
