Hi Mike

From the few issues I had with the machined bay window trailing arms for a
split beam these are my findings (it doesn't appear to be in Bentley:

The bay window trailing arms have surface of 50mm diameter

The late split trailing arms (66 &67 I believe) have surface of 48mm
diameter - I had been told that mine must of been modified as they should of
been the same size as earlier ones but looking at other RHD late arms they
are also 48mm.

Now the earlier ones I know less about.  I have a beam from around 1960 I
think, that has bushes instead of bearings.  Apparently some had bearing
thats were the same size at some point in between 1960 and 1966 - never seen
them though.  These I can't remember the size off the top of my head -
possibly 42mm - in any case they are the same size as the inner surface.

Any particular reason you need to know?

Paul
