Subject: frozen door handles

my door handles keep freezing(the little button becomes impossible to push).
I had used the lock de-icer stuff, sprayed wd-40 all over everything...any
other ideas? I was thinking that I might take the door panels off this
weekend and heat the mechanisms up with a heat gun to try to dry it out,
then spray a ton of wd-40 in there.

open to other suggestions...thanks

oh yeah-my seals are always seeming to stick, making it difficult to shut
and open the door. I have heard of using talcum powder(i assume just baby
powder will work fine) do i just put it on my hand, and wipe it on the
seals....

thanks again.
