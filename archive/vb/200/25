Hi Curt,
If you want to do so high of MPH you will definitely need the 1964-67 brakes 
and thusly require the later RGBs (With the bigger better inner lower 
bearings!!) and front beam also with the 20% bigger brakes.  Personally we 
would go with the 3.44 R&P with gears 1st 3.8, 2nd 2.25, 3rd 1.217, and 4th 
.82, especially since you have the 1835cc which is going to have more cooling 
problems above 3,000 RPM during the summer.  Hopefully your 1835cc size is 
due in part to a stroker crank and SP that will give you more torque which is 
what you really need for hill climbing.  We would suggest having a super 
strong tranny properly built to take the torque of a type 4 engine.  That way 
if the 1835cc is not enough of a hill climber for you, then you can convert a 
type 4 engine to upright and more than likely have all the power you might 
need.
  We are Pmailing our modified tranny history info to you and Tom and will 
happly send it to anyone else out the who would like this info.
