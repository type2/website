I've observed them to settle initially.  This is more likely to be the
splines seating than the actual metal of the bar twisting.  Still, there
has to be a reason for the prohibition against switching a bar from one
side to the other.  In any case, once they settle, they stay that way for
a very long time.  It would be interesting to know what the actual setting
used at the factory (with new torsion housing and spring) was.  Did VW add
in a few extra minutes of twist to account for the initial sag?
