66/67 front  shift rods use a bushing in the end that slips ove a pin welded
on the bus. It could work with a LOT of work, no need though, if all your
other shift components are good you should have no problem shifting,
regardless of what year bus you have.

Can someone please explain the difference between a '60-'65 Bus shifter and
the later '66 and up versions.  Does the earlier version extend further
below
the cab floor?  Might sound silly at first, but what would I need to do to
get
a '66 and up shifter to work on a '60 Bus.

Thanks,
Aaron
