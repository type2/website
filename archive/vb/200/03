Subject: Mid atlantic/tri/quad state NEATO chapter proposed.

Peter is attempting to muster a membership for a DE/NJ/PA/MD??, etc?
area Bus club. If you have interest in developing a club based around
the appeals/ideas of a small group as a whole, please contact myself or
Peter at pcalbar(-at-)comcast.net. So far we have a few interested locals
(PA/NJ) area, but I know there is more of us out here. I'm not a
NEATO/LIMBO member yet, so don't worry if you aren't either.
 
Peter has a Samba ad up about this as well for more reading.

If someone could x post this to type2(-at-)type2.com for the bay owners in
this area as well, that would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Al
