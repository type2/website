Sorry, I can't lose the 70lbs fast enough for the experiment to be viable..

No; I did have them firm in the housing though.

Looks like the original beam to me - doesn't look like it's ever
been out of the bus.


Whatg vexes me is the bus looks low, but has *positive* camber, 
meaning the hweels point *out* at the top.  If I raised it more, they
would point out more.  My 60DD has just a smidge of positive camber.
