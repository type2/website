<< Volks,
 
 I had some surgery over the holidays so I am just catching up.  My son took
 MSB down to Autozone to get some stuff for a '72 Westy he picked up for $500.
 Got a couple of blocks away and busted the canoe paddle flat end of the
 driverside axle.  Busted inside the tranny.  Two big pieces and some ground
 chew in the fluid inside the tranny next to the bearing. Uh-oh, rebuild time,
 right?
================
was the bus making horible noises before this?.  Only time I ever saw a axle 
shaft break the RGbearings had got bad, chewed through the box, let oil out 
and shaving in, finally seized the rgbearings, and snapped the axle.   It had 
been making a 'horrible noise for two or three weeks" she said.

anyway, I think it may not need a rebuild.   I'f take it out and scope out 
teh RGBox/ axle crown gear situation. 
===============
 I wanna make sure this ain't gonna h.................. We think some 
shavings got into the tranny through the
 shaft seal, because the seal was not tight and there was a tad bit of play in
 the shaft.  Uh-oh, rebuild time, right?
........................
that sounds kinda slim chance.  plus case material is soft not cast iron you 
know, and you'ld be amazed at the stuff I'd pulled out of trannys and the 
still ran great.   
 =======================================
 passenger side axle out of her for MSB, but the tranny is an unknown factor,
 so I am going to have mine rebuilt.
 
 Questions:
 
 I definetly need a rebuild, right?
 ...................................
not sure about that.  myself I'd put it together with another axle, making 
sure of lack of slop in the alxe spade area.   did you used to get that thunk 
thunk noise when you stepped on the gas?   definately change the gear oil and 
clean the magnets.
===================
 I want to get a higher ration 4th gear so I can go faster that 57 mph or so
 without over revving my 1835.  Is 3.88 going to do the trick with RGB's still
 on?  I want to keep the RGB's because Ewtah is a mountainous state and I need
 the lower gearing in the first three gears anyway.
 ..........................
WIth a 1835 I'd think you could got to a 3.88 with 1.26 RG and 82 4th and 
pull hills.   
 what is your current gearing?   Does it rev out about 57?
=========================
 Phinally, what in tarnation would cause the axle to break at this key spot?  
I
 bet Bry was busting loose on the accelerator when it happened.  He said he 
was
 in 1st gear.  No I ain't mad, I should have pulled and replaced the tranny
 when I put the Bergmann 1835 in.  Cheap, cheap.  She was probably a tad low 
on
 tranny fluid, but there was still plenty in it when we busted it out.
 
 Oh divine restorers, I am I thinking logically here?
 ...................
it's really freakin wierd.  save the piece for a memeto.  I think he was 
stompin on the gas and it was the torque, probably on top of years of wear, 
maybe faulty metal?  

 But now this is a good time to do a tranny swap, and with the new fat motor 
you can use higher gearing.
