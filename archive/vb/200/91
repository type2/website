Subject: what now?

I am having my son's transaxle pulled, shipped and rebuilt. My question is
Is there anything I can or should look to fix/replace/rebuilt now that the
engine and transaxle is going to be out for a few weeks? The only thing I
can think of is pulling and getting the gas tank checked out. I have seen
what I think is rust particles in the fuel filter.
Thanks for any suggestions!
