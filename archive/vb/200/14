Hi Tom,
We are using the 3.875 R&P with .82 fourth and changed some of the lower 
gears to prevent any RPM gaps between gears.  Cruising speed in fourth (-at-) 
3,000 RPM is about 58 MPH with 205/75R15 tires and the 64-67 RGBs, with a SP 
1641 CW engine.  70 MPH would be about 3,500 RPM.  Personally we would like 
to try a 3.44 R&P tranny with the same lower gearing as we have now and the 
.82 fourth and get about 65 MPH (-at-) 3,000 RPM.  The main biggy factor is how 
much acceleration/hill climbing/passing power you require and that varies 
widely with the individual.  Thus some are only happy with lower gearing 
and/or need bigger badder engine for more HP and torque of anything up to a 2 
liter type 4 engine on up to a V-8.
