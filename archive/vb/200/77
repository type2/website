The Bentley has a good procedure.  That's all I needed to do it.

I used an ordinary protractor with a piece of thread tied through the
center hole and a nut (1/4", coarse thread) tied on the loose end.  Put
the flat side of the protractor against the underside of the trailing arm,
lift the trailing arm to take out the play, and read where the thread lies
on the protractor scale.  Subtract 90 degrees to get the trailing arm
angle!  The Kewl magnetic protractors are a bit handier, but they cost $$$
and aren't any more accurate than a 50 cent plastic protractor.

The most important thing is to get the bus leveled properly on stands
before taking the rear end apart.  Use a carpenter's level on the cargo
floor to make sure it's level.
