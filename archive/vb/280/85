I saw this thread and thought of my Quad-D "Daily Driver Diesel Dasher". Once I
(finally) get it up to hiway speed and am tailgated, all I have to do is stomp
on the accelorator and watch the smoke (and smell) fly.

Somehow, I dont get tailgated that much or that long! =) Must apply to diesel
Vanagons too.

Side note: the Quad-D has been, and currently is, a Tri-D until fixed. Need to
stuff the new axles back into place...

In tech pubs terms you could say
CHANGE TEXT- WAS: "Daily Driver" IS: "Dead"
Repair by Remove and Install, replace with undamaged like item.
