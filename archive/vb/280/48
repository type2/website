Does the center table in a Westy have any extra support it screws into?
Does it just use a long piece of wood that ties into the side bracing?

I'm guessing you have a so 42, like my 65.  It has little hinges screwed to 
the wood,that screws to the side of the bus.   The table has an brass outide 
thing screwed in at the other end that pops into an springy innie thing screwed 
to the side of the bus  by the floor, or was it screwed to the floor.  Idea 
being in either case that the table son't bang when I go around corners.

Hope that helps
