Subject: Re: [VB] New welder for body work

The only thing would say here about the difference betwen a 110 and a
220 volt welder is the 220 unit gives you the option of performing work
on heavier stuff--and will usually give you a longer duty cycle. Longer
work time before the unit shuts itself off---
A 20% duty cycle will give you 20 minutes work time in an hour---40% 40
minutes--
It's a much more versatile machine.
Whle the 110 unit is most certainly cheaper--cheap don't make better in
the long run-- 

I have a Miller 30E--100% duty cycle--and this thing will wear me
out----and I can weld everthing from sheet metal to 1" with no problem.
I like the idea of being able to do just about anythig without the
welder pooping out on me--and having to sit and wait for the unit to
cool down, prior to continuing with the work--

This is just my professional opinion---

I have a Lincoln 150. It's a 110 v model. I've had it 8 years and done
lots of projects with it and never had a single problem with it. The
only time I've ever had a splatter problem is when I attach the ground
to something that is not clean bare metal (I like to cheat sometimes if
I'm trying to do something in a hurry). 
Lincolns are cheaper than their competition but just as good or better
than anything out there in my opinion. If you are only going to do thin
panels, a 250 v. model is overkill.
