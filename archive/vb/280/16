Hmmmm, I'd say you really do have different levels of restorations... 

- all original, date stamped correct, etc,
- all original *german* VW
- all VW
- other
... obviously most will end up with a vehicle with parts from each
category.

Ronnie has told stories about the Porsche crowds, go back and review
them.  I think we need to remember not to loose the forest in the trees
here.  Most people could careless about truly restoring their ride to
perfect and a good thing too since there just isn't that many old parts
out there.  We should appreciate these machines in all aspects of
condition.

... make it like you want to!
