Just be sure that if you plate it, that they get into every nook and
cranny, and there are a lot of crannies in the popout frames. If they
don't then the frames will rust up in the first rain, and continue until
the frames warp from rust. It's better to carefully beadblast the frames,
getting into every crease, then carefully seal all creases with POR,
checking again when dry to be sure that all creases are absolutely sealed.
Then paint the rest of the frame with your choice.

Powder coating has the same dangers. The popout frames are subject to lots
of water and moisture at all times, and they will rust very easily unless
meticulously sealed. Ask me how I know.

Your only option if you insist on chroming, is to do the chromeplating,
then get them home, and under a bright light and magnifier, check where
the plating stops at the creases, both the side creases, and the frame
fold creases at the outer edges, and the ends of each frame half. Then
clean with solvents, dry thoroughly, and seal with POR, using a small
brush. Then check that the POR has gotten into all the creases.

I think if your going to that much trouble you might as well get the polished 
aluminium ones from Creative Engineering.
