Subject: Re: [VB] New welder for body work

Actually, I got a 110 V as I think that is more versatile.   Point being I 
can put it in the bus and take it elsewhere and use it there, even with an 
extension cord!   Useful for welding a broken off throw out arm back on a 54 (split 
case tranny, must split tranny case to replace arm, which is something to 
avoid) in the mountains in the boonies to be able to drive it back.

When I went to the welding supply store to get a replacement wire tube (mine 
was kinking) the guy said what I had was really good.   I'm assuming he knew 
more than me, so that was nice reassurement.  Hobart Handler.   got it new in 
the early 90s.  works well for me, but I haven't been doing any real heavy duty 
stuff.

The only thing would say here about the difference betwen a 110 and a
220 volt welder is the 220 unit gives you the option of performing work
on heavier stuff--and will usually give you a longer duty cycle. Longer
work time before the unit shuts itself off---
A 20% duty cycle will give you 20 minutes work time in an hour---40% 40
minutes--
It's a much more versatile machine.
Whle the 110 unit is most certainly cheaper--cheap don't make better in
the long run--
