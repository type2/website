It's interesting to hear the different opinions on this.  Before VW's I 
was involved in the restoration of Corvettes, and I can tell you the 
attitude is very different, and generally less flexible.  People who 
restore Corvettes usually subscribe to a set of guidelines issued by 
the National Corvette Restorer's Society.  Cars are graded with respect 
to the guidelines which cover every minute detail regarding the car's 
condition as it left the assembly line.  Restorer's go so far as to 
replicate the grease pencil markings assembly line workers place on the 
cars as they come down the line.  Cars are docked points if the paint 
quality is "better" than factory (ie, no orange peel), or the car is 
"over-restored."

I can say from experience, that after finishing a car like this, you'll 
never feel comfortable driving it!  I value originality, but sure don't 
miss searching for bolts with the "proper" head markings.
