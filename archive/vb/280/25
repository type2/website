Subject: mysterious nose holes???

hi peeps,
   i just got through scraping off 3 year old, crusty tape from the nose of 
my bus. well as i was scraping i found about ten holes drilled in the nose 
under the top V part. they aren't deluxe trim, and the antenna and emblem 
holes are filled by the antenna and emblem( duh!). ok my question is, how 
can i fill these holes? i ned a very cheap way to do this. i heard a guy in 
my vw club say to fill in unwanted holes in the bus to just weld in some 
nails and then sand em smooth. will this work? thanks,

                             josh 1967 panel convert
