John,
Just Think about this----

One day --waaay back when you too were probably one of them " pimpled
faced " kids too---:>)

Everyone has to start screwing up somewhere- and Lowe's is as good a
place as any I guess--

Have Fun with your new toy--

Later,

Terry

 I wouldn't need to ask any of their clueless pimple faced 16 year old
sales associates for help. (I have nothing against clueless pimple faced
16 year olds, I just don't want to ask them for advice on welders!!)
