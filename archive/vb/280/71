Won't happen. I was over that education about five minutes after it went away.
I piloted the '97 Eurovan Winnebago from Phx to Irvine Meadows for last
weekend's Neil Young/Elvis Costello show. Only complaint was that there is a
very slight shimmy when cruising over 85-90mph and that I haven't had the time
to install CD/MP3/Satellite radio service player and ditch the cheesy stock
casette deck.

Old Neil is still encouraging us to think for ourselves. I second that emotion.

My opinion is that the price/availability of what were common, "nickle and
dime" aircooled parts are absurd. They are most definitely out of my reach. I
continue to praise all vendors who continue to help make them available.

I know that Ronnie will be the first one to remind me about the cost of
repairs, availability of parts for the Eurocamper. That's all fine with me. I
can deal with that. Seeing as it's paid for, I count the cost as an occasional
car payment. Perhaps it will hold it's value better than a Dodge Neon, I mean,
PT Cruiser. ;-o

My willingness and ability to constantly bust butt and pay the bucks for
aircooled and watercooled Vanagon parts has faded. Then again the availability
of my time/energy/health/dinero has also faded. A snappy salute and high
respect to those of you who continue to enjoy them. Enjoyment is key in
whatever you do. =)
