Subject: RE: [VB] Front Trans Mount Q

  There are only 2 manufacturers of front mounts available (that I am aware
of). German and India. The ones from India fit better then the German which
need the rubber ground out from around the mounting holes in order for the
nuts to seat correctley. I have heard of many people mounting these then
complaining of the front mount breaking or coming loose. Failure to remove
the excess rubber will create problems down the road. The mounts from India
do not need this rubber ground out and I have found these to last as long as
the German ones ,which are more then likely made in some 3rd world country
due to the fact that only GERMANY is cast in the rubber mount and not MADE
IN GERMANY, just like the craddle mounts. If you look closley at the craddle
mounts you can see where the plate was inserted to say Germany and comparing
the 2 mounts shows that they are identical except for the Germany cast in
them.
  I usually have Genuine VW de Mexico saddle mounts but am currently out of
these.

1) is there a source for *good* front mounts?  I replaced
mine recently - about a month ago - and the new one already
broke!   

2) anyone ever replace the mount without removing the transmission?

Thanks!

Thom
