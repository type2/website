I'm not even sure that people who restore a bus to original condition are doing it for recognition. I know I haven't done that with mine. I don't think it's any different than David collection period accessories for his truck. He is doing a "time piece" more or less and so is someone who is looking to put all of the year correct parts on their bus. I by no means drive a show car but it looks pretty decent , is mosty year correct parts wise and I drive it all over the place. If I had a barndoor deluxe that was restored I might be a little more restricted as to where I would take it. A 30K 25HP bus on I 40 or I 15 is just beggin' to get hit! The nice thing about shows are that with the wide selection of buses there you and I would both be occupied, but I bet a dollar I can look at ALL of the undercarriages
 of the buses I like!  ;) 
 
Every time I make it to a show or on a camping trip "I win".
