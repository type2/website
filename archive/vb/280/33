Kevin, now you're embarrassing us. Doesn't everyone already have a set of
internal snap ring pliers? Just kidding.

I bought mine at a local tool distributor about 28 years ago and they still
work great. I have seen them at really good FLAPS, not Schucks! They have kind
of a of a 3/16 square duckbill end on them and you squeeze them to open them
up.

I hate to change the apparently utterly fascinating subject of restoration
but
what do you people use to remove the snap ring that holds the cam and
distributor drive gears on the crankshaft and where did you get it?
