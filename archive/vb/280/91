Subject: Re: [VB] axle tube retainer woes

If you have a complete gasket set, you will notice that the gaskets are
different thicknesses. Use the thickest gasket  and then add more until it
frees-up. I've never had to use more than 3 gaskets when I use the thickest
gasket first. As long as the plastic packing piece that goes on the
differential cover is not too scratched-up and the flange on the axle that
contacts it isn't bent, there should be no reason you shouldn't be able to
move the axle when the gaskets are installed correctly.

Be aware that the retaining ring is sometimes bent. Take a straightedge and
lay it across the top of the ring where it bolts to the differential cover
to check it.

I just installed my transmission last night and today I'm trying to
re-attach
the axle tube retainers. I started with three gaskets and worked down to one
of the thinnest, each time torquing the bolts to spec (14 ft/lbs. as per the
manual, in standard flange series). Each time it seems too tight. The axle
will not drop freely under it's own weight. in fact it won't budge at all,
even when I push on it.
