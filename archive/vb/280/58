Subject: Nuts size, Big nuts vs Small nuts...

Oh come on, you guys are sickos!! I am talking about
transmissions...
I'm afraid I am about to show my ignorance, but will
someone explain the difference to me between Big nut
tranny and small nut tranny. I am ASSUMING that the
nut size refers to the axle nut that holds the wheel
hubs on, is this correct?? 
So what years had big nuts nad what years had small
nuts, and are there andvatges to having one versus the other??
