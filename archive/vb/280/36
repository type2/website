Subject: RE: [VB] New welder for body work

I have never held a bead so long that it force my 110VAC arc to shut down.
Short passes to keep the metal from warping and then additional fill in passes
until the bead is done. I also have a body stitch welder which uses 1/16" rod
and does body work. Never as good as a wire feed, but nothing to turn your
nose up at.

The only thing would say here about the difference betwen a 110 and a
220 volt welder is the 220 unit gives you the option of performing work
on heavier stuff--and will usually give you a longer duty cycle. Longer
work time before the unit shuts itself off---
Later,
