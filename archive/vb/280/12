Neon green... where are those?  

Hmmmm, v80 DCO (dumb current owner) mods:  
-US spec bucket wire control cable, 
-one US spec wire crimp and 6" wire for schwingen solenoid ground, 
-incorrect axle tube boot clamps (hey ronnie, I never heard back on
those),
-off the shelf (ick) pulley belts for the hydraulic pump, 
-US spec 10-40 Havoline oil and gear oil, 
-US spec air in a few of the tires but mostly still og European
molecules. 

... very offensive indeed ;-)

Ask him about the origins of the neon green push on connectors in his
cherry
picker truck.  :)  I am curious what year VW started using those?   :)
