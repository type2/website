Subject: RE: [VB] "Restorations, rebuilds, customs and DNA

If you drill down deep enough, there could never be an 'ultimate' resto.
There will ALWAYS be compromises, but I think that's why we say
'restored' in the first place.  You say to the dude looking at your car
at the show, "This thing here that yer lookin at has utilized all og
parts, correct color, blah blah blah... Its restored as close to its
condition as it left the factory as I could get".  Or, you could have
said, "I built this thing to represent what a hot rod could have been on
June 15, 1972, all parts are period correct", or how 'bout "I found a
bunch of pieces and I slapped it together... it's restored to driving
condition"...  If you simply have a plan to build a car with specific
*new* components (i.e. Ronnie) I'd call it a 'custom' or 'driver' or
whatever, since it's not being restored to anything except for it's
capacity to provide reliable daily transportation (no offense Ronnie).

I think we shouldn't get confused to 'maintained with original parts'
and 'restored with original parts' either...

So,

What this means is, there are very few genetically correct resto jobs,
eh?
