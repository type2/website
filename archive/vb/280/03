Subject: Re: [VB] Front Trans Mount Q

Hello Guys   Yes the mount can be changed with the tranny in place. Remove 
the cables,starter wires , back big bolts, front mount nuts, then take a screw 
jack and  2 block of woods and put the jack between the two pieces of wood and 
the body and starter and screw the tran back. With a rolling jack this can 
even be done with the motor in place. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing salem
