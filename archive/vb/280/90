Our "economy" parts are basically the cheapest available part within the
limits of what I feel is acceptable quality. (That is, decent quality,
return rate of less than 1%, but not necessarily up to the standards of
the original German or OEM part, as you might expect from the much lower
price.) There are of course some brands/products that I won't ship at
any price, no matter how cheap. When possible I try to offer three
levels of price/quality on most parts, when I can get it - economy, OEM
or German, and something in the middle. Sometimes this doesn't happen
either because availability isn't there, because I don't trust the only
available "economy" brand, or because the cheaper one is just not enough
cheaper than the good one to be even worth bothering with.  They're all
on the website. If you come across one designated a "hot buy" (lightning
bolt icon), it generally is because I feel it to be the best value (good
quality and price). 

The economy wheel cylinders can vary based on availability, but my last
supply was actually Brazilian-made (KMM), as is Varga. I checked with
the distributor just now and they say that this is what they are still
shipping.  We have so far had very good results with this brand.
