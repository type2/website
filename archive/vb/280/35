Been an interesting thread, but one thing has been left out. Should
restoration be as close as the day it came off the assembly line or also
include all of the factory to dealer recalls for changes and fixes that may
occur years later?

just a thought

I can say from experience, that after finishing a car like this, you'll
never feel comfortable driving it!  I value originality, but sure don't
miss searching for bolts with the "proper" head markings.
