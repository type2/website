The H5 case is single relief and the B6 is dual relief.

The H5 case is 33 or 34 years old, while the B6 case is around 32
years old.  That's quite a while.

This is over 33% more displacement than the H5 case was designed for
(when new) and 25% more displacement than the B6 case was designed
for (when new).

My _opinion_ would be to save both cases for a stock rebuild and
build a 2L on a new case.
