Hi everyone,
    Does anyone have a lead on a vw shop in the area?  I've checked out 
several  body shops and "supposed" vw shops and they are confused as to what 
a 57 singlecab even looks like. I've heard more than 1 time that vw did not 
make them, but what do you expect from a cut and weld insurance is our best 
customer shop!  I have everything ready to go for reassembly but just need 
someone with the body skills to put the pieces in the "correct" places so I 
can add the parts and get it on the road before winter.
                                                                 Steve 57 
singlecab (early)
