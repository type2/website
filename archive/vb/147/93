Steve,

Try contacting the Northeast Illinois VW Association (NIVA).  There are
several members who've been involved for many years and may have some
Chicago area leads.  They also have a couple of shows each year (along
with Rockford's Stateline Volks Folks who have a show August 24 or 25 in
Freeport) that might help you make some contacts.

n_i_v_a(-at-)yahoo.com is the club address, or try ahrens(-at-)ameritech.net for
Tina Ehrens, the newsletter editor.  I don't think they have a web page.

I think I'm the farthest west of all the NIVA people, out on the Rock
River near Byron.  I remember an old VW place near Dundee I drove by a
few years ago.  They had a bubble window double cab on the lot.  Haven't
been back that way for a while.

You may not find much, but 80 miles can be better than 800 miles if you
find a place that can do the work.

Good luck.

-Jim Bryant
