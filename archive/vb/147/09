Subject: Oil temperature - Alternative sender?

Hi Everyone,

I was reading through Bill Fishers book on hot-rodding T1 engines last night
and found an interesting product that I have not seen before... I am hoping
it is still around.

The oil temperature sender was put in place of the oil pressure relief bolts
(I use the word bolt very loosely here).  This sender is apparently the most
ideal for taking the temperature .  Also the stock spring and plunger are
retained so there is zero effect on the oil by-pass system.

Does anyone make this part anymore?  VDO?  The original in the book seemed
to be an EMPI part that was made in Japan by a supplier to Honda motorcycle
gages.

Why bother you ask?  Well in my winter project motor I plan to run a 1.5
quart deep sump and if I use a normal sump plate installed sender it will be
inaccurate (read too cool).


Thanks for any leads or insights,
