Subject: Re: [VB] Full fow oil pump?

...
 If your case is tapped for full flow you should have
a "hole" in it on the left hand side of the case below
the oil temp sender and below the pulley tin. 
A full flow pump will not effect your mufflers
mounting but it can be a tight fit against the pulley
tin. If it is a "full flow pump" (it is actually the
cover) there should be a outlet on the pump cover.
Mine is a berg cover and the outlet faces out at 9
o'clock.
