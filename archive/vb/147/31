I've been using them for years and they do work.   If it bothers you to
use the oil pressure light as a warning, you have to run a separate light.
If your engine runs normal temps they do tell you when you are about 225
degrees.  I used to think Gene Berg was a little crazy in his ranting
about gauges until my oil temp gauge bit me in the *ss.  Gauges/sensors can
change.  The dipstick costs $15 or so, but you have to order at least $50
to do business with them, they don't want to mess with the nickle-dime
stuff.
IF your engine runs too hot, then it's not much use.  My spare engine
started running hot after I put in a 3.88 tranny.  I just pulled the
dipstick wire off since at that point it's just an aggrevation reminding
you the engine is over 225.  The dipstick senders are a good cheap device.
Gauges have their place, but I'll never really believe one unless it's
recently calibrated to at least be close.
I keep check on the Berg senders and so far they have stayed pretty close.
