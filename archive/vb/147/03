Hello all,
 I just returned from the Rockingham NC show. I had a blast. We caravanned
down last night with our 65 singlecab, 75 westy and our friend in his 67
kombi. We camped under the trees with 2 71 busses a vanagon and a 67 bug.
Stayed up late , had a good time and then crashed . I slept great although I
only got a total of 4.5 hrs of sleep.
There were not a lot of busses there compared to other larger shows but I
thought the turn out wasn't to bad for Rockingham., There was a 66 EZ
camper, 67 kombi ,66 dormmobile, orange slammed Split,my 65 singlecab,
71bus, 71camper, a slammed 70 deluxe, and my 75. I also saw a few late
campers in the parking lot. The EZ Camper won best in class.  Hopefully I
will have some pics up soon
I am sunburned and tired so its time to sign off,
 Later-
Bryan
