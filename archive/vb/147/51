Subject: Re: [VB] H5 vs B6 engine case

H cases have 1 relief valve and I think smaller oil passages( look at where 
the pump fits and the oil cooler holes).

Believe the H and B are the same alloy.

I would leave both on the shelf and use a A series case (or newer) that is 
the better alloy as well as having dual oil relief.  I have happily driven an 
H case for years in a bus I used to have, but that one hadn't been abused.  
If they are often the studs pull out - which is a sign that the engine over 
heated.   They are also more likely to warp.  The later alloy is more 
tolerance of abuse.  I like the case savered cases better - small studs.

 Would anyone care to outline any advantages/disadvantages between either a
 late H5 1500 case vs an early B6 1600 case?  This would be for a 2l (82x88)
 motor.
