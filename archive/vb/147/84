Subject: RE: [VB] More on Sway Bars and Disc Brake Kits

You can use a number of rear disc brake combos on the rear of a bus, you
would have to use a different caliper if you want an e-brake though.
here is a SHORT list of manufacturers.

CSP, Willwood, JaMar, CNC, Cal Pacific rear kit and there are others also.
JaMar makes a drag race rear brake that uses great hubs, but also theses
will also only fit small axles.
    I have made a couple of sets of rear disc for large nut axles useing a
late bay hub, chevy K chassis rear calipers with e-brake, Mercedes 600
rotors and Woods 5 to 5 chromolly adapters to get the wide 5 pattern. easy
and cheap to do. Hubs (easy find at junk yard), new ate rotors 75 dollars a
pair, K car calipers (loaded) 45 a pair rebuilt, adapter plate 80 dollars
for 2 from Woods Wheels, mounting brackets for calipers made here in the
shop. Total Cost around 250 dollars plus time to fabricate and mount.

Hi
 RGB = reduction gearbox
Porsche wheel pcd (pitch circle diameter) is 5 X 130 mm Split bus is 5 x 
205mm
There is a mention of using porsche disc brakes in IRS (independent rear 
suspension) on www.23window.com . But it isn't a bolt on job.
