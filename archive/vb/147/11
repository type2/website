Subject: Full fow oil pump?

I'm getting ready to reinstall the engine in my '65 DC after 6 years of restoration (HOORAY!)

The engine is a 1600 DC and the oil pump has an external fitting at 5 o'clock (as you face the
engine from the crankshaft pulley side). The fitting has a pipe about 3/8 inch in diameter that is
cut-off and bent over to seal the end of the pipe.

Is this a full flow oil pump? I'm asking because the engine had headers and J pipes on it and I want
to put a stock exhaust back on it and I've heard that the full flow oil pumps keep the muffler from
fitting correctly.

Also, if this is a full flow pump, does that mean that the case is drilled for a full flow pump? If
it is, does that mean I have to run a full flow pump or can I put a standard oil pump back in it?
