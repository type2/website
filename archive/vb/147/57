Subject: RE: [VB] redux box adapter kit...

   The no hop kit consist of a tube that goes over the axle tube. They have
a grease zerk on them to keep them moving freely. From the tube a bar is
connected to the torsion to keep the axle from moving. I have gotten bugs
here in the shop where they never greased the tubes and twisted the RGB
completeley off the axle.
   There still is a company that makes these on a limited basis but I have
never found them. Most of the old timers here in town just make there own. I
have an Old School Johnson no hop kit that I got years ago

Subject: [VB] redux box adapter kit...


 was lookin thru sum old Hot VW mags last night... and came across a Johnnys

Speed and Chrome ad. In that ad was a "redux box adapter kit"... Now I 
realize this is for a B*g... but..... they offered 3 different kits that 
allow the use of a bus tranny with redux boxes on a SA B*g. Upright box 
adapter, Laydown box adapter... now this one is the kicker... "upright gear 
redux box adapter with no hop kit"  it looks kinda like a trailing arm that 
bolts to the redux boxs, and the other end welds to the torsion tube, with 
both ends having a pivot point. Has anyone ever converted a Baja using this 
"no hop" setup, and is there a such animal for a bus. My driveway is kinda 
steep, and takin off from a dead stop on it really shutters the ole truck...

 Now if I could just figure out a way to keep both back tires on the ground 
during high speed corners... but thats another story.
