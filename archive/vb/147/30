All you do is recirculate the warm air, both on a bus and a bug.  It's
worse on a bus because of the shape of the vehicle.  Leave the lid closed
and make sure your rubber seals are intact around the engine and the lid.

George,
I'll have to exception to your answer this time. The air flow design of the
bug body showed the designers where to place the engine air intake vents,
which happens to be right near the deck lid seam. As the "cooling" air
slides over the top of the beetle it is siphoned off through the vent with
the negative pressure in the engine compartment developed by the shroud fan.
The flow is from the vent, though the fan, down around the cylinders and out
the back past the exhaust. Do a search on Google or Yahoo search for
Volkswagen Beetle airflow studies. I was not able to find ones for the
bus/truck, but I'm sure that the vent area intake situation applies there
also. On a bus or truck I wouldn't open the engine lid because of the hot
exhaust and air that travels off the engine is in a circular vortex right
behind the vehicle.
