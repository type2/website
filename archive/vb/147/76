1st graph- air flow vs fan speed curve- shows that your get more air flow 
from a doghouse fan (34mm) than regular (28mm) fan.  ya, no surprises

2nd graph shows airflow (cfm) vs engine speed  with two variables- fan size 
(28mm or 34mm), and crank pulley size ('standard' or 'power' - actual size 
not mentioned.)  
So there are 4 lines on the graphs, and they make it a bit more confusing by 
moving shims and getting a min and max for each pulley/fan combo.  
Basically, the bigger crank pulley with wider (doghouse 34mm) fan blows most 
air- the power pulley with 28mm fan blows the least.  Ya, seems obvious but 
this does give numbers,  nice. The colours are a bit confusing.  wow man, 
psychedelic!!!

the third graph shows regular vs power pulley for heat transfer, cooling and 
fan power, as a reduction.  This is a bit confusing.  Doesn't say what size 
fan is used.   Also says 15% reduction in cooling air flow, which totally 
does not jive with graph 2.  graph 2 shows at 3000 engine rpm ~1300cfm  with 
doghouse/std pulley and ~775cfm with dog/power, a whopping reduction of ~40% 
of cooling air flow by switching to a power pulley.

anyway, get to the important bit- heat transfer...they say there is an 
average of 11% reduction of heat transfer by switching to the power pulley, 
and you get 39% reduction in 'fan power' whatever that means.   I wonder what 
this translates to in terms of engine oil temp and cooling.   They seem to 
think it a good thing to use power pulleys.  

turn it around, you get 11% MORE heat transfer by using a regular size 
pulley.   I wonder what the increase in heat transfer would have been by 
switch to doghouse from regular.   Also there seems to be a non linear 
relationship between air flow and heat transfer.

pretty cool site, all in all
