That's probably not a brand name.  Instead it means the carb is
designed for 49-states emissions laws instead of California emissions
laws.  The 34-PICT-3 was late enough that there were "federal" and
"California" versions.

If you are buying a carb that says it is a 34-PICT-3, it's either
a German Solex, Mexican Solex (Bocar), or Brazilian Solex (Brosol).
They will be rebuilt with different jets and settings based on the
year and application.  Keep in mind that any VW carb you get is
probably jetted for a Bug and may require a jet change or two to
run right on a Bus.
