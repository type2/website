Ah, but there is a dipstick sender for the VDO Gauge - VDO PN 323081 at
about $44 when I last checked - Ronnie prolly has 'em cheaper.

Dipstick senders tend to read about 10 to 20 degrees hotter on the average
than the oil plate mounted variety, mostly because the "stick" transduces
heat from the sleeve it mounts into.  At least that's been my experience.
Strictly personal, but I believe the oil plate sender offers the best
accurate reading.

The sender for the Oil Relief Plug hole would be VDO PN 323064 I believe
(M18x1.5 Thread).  Last price I saw was about $15 for this puppy.  How
accurate?  I dunno, never used this sender before.
