Matt,

It's possible to do this alone (two hands) in about 15 minutes - I know!
;-)

Take one of the two bolts that holds the whole thing down and
together, and use it to hold the lockout plate and the bracket under the
bus together while you guide the orchestrated mess into place from above,
with two hands (ie, bolt the lockout plate to the bracket, thru the hole
from inside the cab, without going thru the cover plate). Then, guide the
mess in there, and loosely bolt it down thru the other hole using the
other bolt, enough to hold everything more or less in place. Then unscrew
the first bolt, and send it thru the remaining hole of the cover plate,
and tighten both down - you're done!  ;-)

OH yeah, NOW smear grease over the seat covers and all of your tools. Then
reinstall your floor mat.
