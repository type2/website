Subject: Got a Bus, now shipping.....

.... once and again people come over and post this question..... what's the best and cheapest way to
ship a Bus cross country? I'm moving it from Lake Havasu to Chi-town.... Bus runs and drives...

I would gladly drive it home (It would most likely be fun thing to do) but Ronnie suggested not to
do it for some reasons..... 1,800 miles we're talking about here....

thanks all,
