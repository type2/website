Subject: RE: [VB] Oil temperature - Alternative sender?

Personally I do not care for the Berg dipstick sender.

Why you ask?  Because the only models I have seen are only equipped with the
"idiot light" blinking feature at 225F.  I want something that functions
like a gage, not just an idiot light, so I can tell trends in heat and warm
up times.  Not to mention testing of cooling items that will help save 5
degrees here or there.

Now if there is a dipstick setup that is a true sender that works with a VDO
gage, that would be good.

Take Care,
Adrian

What about the dip stick sender that Gene Berg sells.  Anyone have any
experience??  Seems like an excellent solution.
