Subject: RE: [VB] Full fow oil pump?

I think someone installed the cover incorrectly.  Twist that bad boy around
90 degrees pointing left.

Also there should be a tapped hole in the case if it is to run full flow.
Again look at the left hand side of the case and follow the oil flow tube
bulges around to see it there is a hole (and no it is not the oil pressure
sender hole).

It is possible that someone slapped on a full flow cover by accident on a
non-tapped case... It just would not run this way :(

There are a few tricks to the full flow process so if you are unsure on what
you have I would bring it to someone to check out first...  If there is a
plug in the oil galley after the pump you have an engine that will explode
in about 10 minutes because of a blocked oil passage.


Good Luck,
