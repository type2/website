Subject: RE: [VB] H5 vs B6 engine case

Hi all,

thanks for the input.

First I'd like to clarify that I want to build a motor with an 82 stroke and
88 bore... I guess I put it that way instead of the reverse of bore then
stroke.... my faux pas :-O


Next, while a newer AS case sounds like the sane choice, I simply can't use
a case newer than B6!!!



David
