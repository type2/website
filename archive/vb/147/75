Subject: More on Sway Bars and Disc Brake Kits


Adrain Said: I assume you have albatross adjusters in that front beam to 
lower it?


Richard Said: Adrian, You assume correctly!  I bought the 68 ball joint beam 
from Way Out Salvage and had it sent to Bus Boys for reconditioning.  When 
they sent it back, I askedthem to include pretty much every part for redoing 
the front end on my 66.  Everything from the steering box, tie rods, and 
ball joints to the grub screws and lock nuts!  The new beam and front end 
mated up perfectly on the shop floor . . . I hope to actually be able to put 
the thing on the road in another six months.


Adrain Said: The rear.. oh the rear..  Thomas Ainley is working on a rear 
944 kit as we  speak with the big nut RGBs.  Personally I will take mine 
with a small nut RGB since it  goes on like a Beetle conversion... More 
updates to come this weekend once I pick up an early rear end to play with.  
You will need to play with the tranny gears to actually cruise on the 
interstate.


Richard Said: Forgive my ignorance, but what is an RGB?  And what does the 
big and small refer to?  I put in a new tranny from Stuff transmissions, 
rebuilt all the way out to the reduction boxes, with an oversized ring and 
pinion, two stump-pullin' low gears, and a freeway flyer high gear (all for 
tackling the mountains here in Colorado).  I am using Empi five-spoke rims 
on the stock rear drums and brakes.  Will this rear 944 kit you are talking 
about bolt onto this setup on my bus, and will I still be able to use the 
Empi five-spokes?  Also, forgive me not knowing names that well, but is 
Thomas Ainley associated with a company?  If so, what?  How do I contact him 
about this kit-in-the-making?


Adrain Said:  Also the rear might be able to use a 944 rear sway bar (rumor) 
which would be cool.  The camber compensator can be used with this as well. 
Bilstein does make shocks to fit the splits, I think the HD green units. 
Currently I think www.shox.com has the lowest prices.  No bus specific parts 
house has a good deal on them, I imagine volume related.  The KYBs are going 
to be turds compared to any Bilstein in the long run.


Richard Said: Can anyone else out there confirm or deny this rumor about 
using a 944 rear sway bar?  How might I find such an item?  Thanks for the 
info about the KYBs.  At the time, the prevailing advice I was receiving 
from people was that the Bilstein's were not
worth the upgrade in price.  I will have to look into this further (anyone 
out there have a comment on this?)



Adrain Said:  As part of these conversions you end up with Porsche lug bolt 
pattern. Some people like this and some hate it.  So no stock bus wheels.  
The closest you can come is to use Porsche steel rims (spare tire units) in 
a 15"x5.5" which looks really mean if done right.


Richard Said: I guess this question feeds back into my question above about 
whether or not I can use the Empis.  I am not sure what a Porsche lug bot 
pattern is, or how that compares to whatever pattern is on my stock drums, 
or to whatever patterns are on any other drums (I can count, though, so I 
know that some have four lugs and some have five ;-).



Adrain Said:  Dave at Creative Engineering is trying to come up with a rear 
disc setup for the baywindows which could probably work on the big nut RGBs, 
but that is yet to be released... Bug him about it, really. Disc brakes kick 
butt over the drums... But it is not easy or cheap.  Now once it is 
converted it will be easier to maintain in the longrun, but the initial 
outlay is pretty hefty.... Once you do all these changes then you will want 
a bigger engine.  So just keep that wallet open :(


Richard Said: So, it sounds like right now there is no one out there who has 
a ready-to-go bolt-on disc brake conversion kit for my 66 Samba?  Am I 
reading you right?  As for the outlay now for payoff in the long run, I am 
always for that! (when I am not broke, that is.)  As for a bigger engine, I 
have built a 1914 with dual 44 Webers, a Bernie Bergmann cooling kit, CB 
Performance deep sump, Kymco super cooler, dual relief, full flow case, etc. 
. . . again, for tackling the Rocky mountains.

Now, don't let all of this spending give anyone the idea that my pockets are 
deep.  I cashed in my retirement early and pulled out all of my savings for 
this project, plus hocked myself to the hilt to boot.  I just want to do 
this project RIGHT, and not ever look back and say, "Damn, if only . . . "

I look forward to any and all responses.
