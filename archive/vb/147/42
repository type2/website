I use Permatex silver anti-sieze liberally on the threads of the lugs for
the last 25 years, tighten them down hard but not ridiculously tight using
a 18 inch breaker bar/half inch drive with socket, and never have any
problems getting them off (or on).

Thanks Cal,
I'll have to try that. I don't know why my lug bolts tighten up when I hear
so many complaints of loose ones. Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut
before Murphy hears me !
