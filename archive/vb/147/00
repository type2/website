Posted some pics on Thom's site.  Were only about 10-15 splits in the show 
and no sundials, so I had to vote on a westy.  There was a schimmenwagen and 
a breubox (or something like that, was wierd).  Met up with John Baker and 
swapped dizzy's and I picked up a couple of shirts for a buck ea..  Saw 
Frank's bus too.  It got real hot about noon time and we had picked over all 
the swappers stuff (no hat + no hair = sunburn).  My cohorts and I headed 
back to Fort Wayne.  I saw a flyer about a campout in Indiana coming up, put 
on by FMBC?  Anyone got any info on this?

Oh I got the guy's email that makes those way cool bus planters,
GARDEN BUGZ
concrete yard ornaments
