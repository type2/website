VintageBussers:

I picked up "Alice's Restaurant" on DVD over the weekend and sat Sunday
night with the "Arlo's Commentary" setting on as I watched the movie. 
This from Arlo:

************
By the way, I never even had a red VW Microbus.  In real life that was
Ray's VW Microbus.  And you would have though that in the 30 years since
this film that we would have heard something from VW, they would have
called up and said, "Let's do a promotion or something."  Not one call. 
Nothing. I think we helped them sell more of them things than anyone in
the world and we never heard anything from them at all.
**********

He was light-hearted about it, not like he was holding some grudge.  It
was probably taped a few years ago.  I suspect we won't see Arlo in a
Concept 2 for the sequel.
