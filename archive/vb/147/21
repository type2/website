I looked again and there are two outlets/inlets on the cover. One is positioned a 9 o'clock and
another is at about 4 or 5 o'clock. Both have a steel tube attached that is cut-off and bent over to
seal it.

There are no tapped holes in the case.

The cover is definitely there and there are no holes in the case. I know the engine runs because I
drove it before I parked it to start the restoration on the body. Since both inlets on the cover are
blocked-off, I suppose its just acting like a standard pump, right? If so, any drawbacks to just
leaving it as it is?

Believe it or not, I used to be a VW mechanic but, I never worked on modified engines,  just
stockers.  I don't want to take it to a shop because I would rather do my own work. Besides, this
list has more knowledge and better advise than just about any mechanic I may find around here.
