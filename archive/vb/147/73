   One of the best body guys (VW'S) I know of is in Detroit, there are a
couple more on the Jersey shore and another up in the Maine area. These are
all low key people who work by word of mouth only. Do excellent work and
have all had cars in the VW mags. I can p-mail your name and number to them
if you would like. There was another in the Grand Rapids area of Michigan,
but he's retired.

in the Midwest. www.buskatiers.org

Hi everyone,
    Does anyone have a lead on a vw shop in the area?  I've checked out 
several  body shops and "supposed" vw shops and they are confused as to what

a 57 singlecab even looks like. I've heard more than 1 time that vw did not 
make them, but what do you expect from a cut and weld insurance is our best 
customer shop!  I have everything ready to go for reassembly but just need 
someone with the body skills to put the pieces in the "correct" places so I 
can add the parts and get it on the road before winter.
                                                                 Steve 57
