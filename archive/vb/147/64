Subject: Sway Bars and Disk Brake Kits


Speaking of better handling for the ole bus, I have some questions for you 
all.

First, does someone make a rear sway bar for a splitty with swing axles and 
redux boxes,
and if they do, is this either different from or can it be used in addition 
to an item
called a "camber compensator" I have seen advertised?

Second, does anyone make a rear disk brake kit for splitty with swing axle 
and redux
boxes.  If no one makes such a kit, can any of the other kits out there be 
adapted for this
application?  Can anyone recommend any brands?

Just for background, my 66 project bus has a german front end disk brake kit 
on a 68 ball
joint adjustable front beam (all components, including steering box are 
rebuilt), 7/8"
front sway bar, a rear camber compensator, stock rear drum brakes, and KYB 
shocks all
around.

--As you can tell, I am trying to improve the ride of my baby in any way I 
can.  Any other
suggestions for improving handling would also be appreciated.
