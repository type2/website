Rich,

Think about it. Would you rather:

1. Drive 800 miles to Kelly's place, take a plane back to Chi-town and then take a plane back to
Kelly's place to pick it up or ...

2. Give a 2nd or 3rd rate shop a suitcase full of money to get them to start working on your truck
and, "if" they ever decide to actually start working on it, trying to figure-out how you are going
to get enough money to get it out of hock.

Kelly's fast and reasonable. Well worth the plane fare to NC.
