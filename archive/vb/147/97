If it was pointing more at 4ish it's possible that somebody
had pulled the split pin on the bottom and turned the offset
drive key around.......

Sounds like you are 90 degrees out John. If you had verified that the rotor
on the .009 was pointing to the #1 notch on the distributor before you
pulled it, then your 205 vac can distributor will be pointing there also.
Trust me on this, #1 is at the notch on all T-1 distributors for all upright
motors. I have been building these things for 28 years and it's still the
same. 205 is a good choice for all around driving in my opinion. H through R
cans are pretty much the same, some pull it all in a little earlier in RPM,
but not so much as you would notice.

Alright All, I have a 71 westy that has had the 009 dizzy on it since I got
it. I found what I thought was the stock vac dizzy at a swap meet, a 205Q
which is the first number listed for my bus on the oldvolokshome dizzy spec
page.  
So, I turn my engine to TDC and remove the 009.  Then when I install the
205Q,
the rotor does not line up with the notch on the lip of the dizzy, which
indicates where #1 should fire at TDC, it looks more like it is lined up
where
the #2 will fire, yet the engine is DEFINITELY at #1 TDC (i took out the #1
spark plug and felt with a pencil to confirm TDC)  So, what the hell is goin
on here? Is it just as simple as changing the plug wires around to match the
dizzy TDC mark?
