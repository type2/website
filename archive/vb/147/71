To be honest...... not really. I know that "Woody" had his Bus done in Cali. He probably would of
done it here locally if he knew of a shop that would do it right. Most of the guys around here laugh
in my face when I ask them about any work on a Bus....
These are almost extinct in Illinois..... almost.
