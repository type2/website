I agree, get the 46mm socket with 3/4 inch drive, plus a breaker bar
with matching 3/4 inch driver, plus a 3 foot pipe to fit over the end of the
breaker bar. The 46mm socket is also a 1 - 13/16 inch socket - that's what
I've been using for decades. If you make some marks at the one-foot and
two-foot distance from the center of the socket, on the pipe, and divide
your body weight into the 225 ftlb requirement for the torque, you'll get
the distance where you should gradually apply one of your feet, while
grabbing the roofline of the bus, then lift your other foot on top of the
first foot, so all your body weight is at the proper distance point. No
hopping or jumping allowed. When the nut stops turning, that's 225 foot
pounds of torque.  For my 125 pounds of weight, I stand on a mark made at
the 1.8 foot (one foot plus 9 inches) point on the pipe. You may have to
tighten it a tiny bit more to line up the holes for the cotter pin.
