Subject: Re: [VB] H5 vs B6 engine case

The H and B cases are horrible candidates to build up as a performance
motor.

Small oil passages, single relief, cruddy magnesium blend... Blah blah blah.

Splurge and get a newer case.  Used ones should be around $125 and new ones
$300ish.

Also 82x88 is a very odd combination.  I am not sure the 88s even come in a
"B" set?  Ronnie has about the biggest 88 setup I would go with at 1799cc
(88x74).  Anything bigger than that stick with the 90.5 "B" P&Cs.

An 82 stroke means you better get friendly with the grinding wheel for
clearancing big time :(  I would stick closer to a 76 where the clearancing
is much easier, maybe 78 if you know your stuff.

These big motors take money, time, more money, and lots of knowledge to
build right.  Unless you have deep pockets I would stick with something more
conservative that is known to get a good return for your time and money
spent.
