Subject: Re: [VB] Oil temperature - Alternative sender?

(I use the word bolt very loosely here).  This sender is apparently the most
ideal for taking the temperature .  <

Someone e-mailed me off list and made a good point.  There is not a whole
lot of oil flow going over the sensor here and you would be basically taking
the case temperature over the oil temperature.

Any thoughts on this?
