 Just as a side note the 46mm axle nut is only to be tightened to 250 pounds
 max (215-250 range being good).  For the 36mm 215 pounds max.
 
 I think most people over tighten these nuts like crazy.

I don't think anyone overtightens the axle nuts on purpose. Actually,  
there's only a
hair's difference between 215 & 250 ft-lbf torque. The difference is so small 
that one can't tell whether he's overtightening or not. Using a torque 
wrench, a man can't put
up 250 ft-lbf. So he's forced to either use a Kymco tool or an impact wrench 
rated at 250 ft-lbf.  A few torque wrenches are rated at 250 ft-lbf, but they 
have long handles and are a bitch to use. Whatever, when a man puts up about 
250 ft-lbf,  that's good enough.
