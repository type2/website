Subject: Re: [VB] Info on Split Bus dash cut-out for radio needed

Hi Richard,
4-31/32" center to center.  1-1/2 x 3-3/4 hole.  No face plate, some used a 
plate that went between the radio and the dash and showed through around the 
face opening.  Assuming you are looking for a radio for your 1964 bus, radios 
from 1953-57 bugs, and 1955-66 KGs will fit.
