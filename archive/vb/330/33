Subject: Re: [VB] (bad leak) too much oil?

<...>
Before you go pointing fingers, take your dipstick out
and see if it smells like gasoline.  It is a lot more
likely that your fuel pump diaphragm is ruptured and
overfilling your crankcase (and thinning your oil) than
a reputable shop would overfill your oil by 2 quarts.
The symptoms you describe are the exact symptoms of a
bad fuel pump.  More than likely you can just replace
the fuel pump and change the oil and your main seal is
fine.
