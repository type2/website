Hi Dylan,
We definitely would suggest you get a 3.88 R&P FF with .82 fourth gear 
tranny.  Make sure to talk to your tranny rebuilder to make sure not to have any 
gaps between gears when using 1,500 & 3,000 RPM range.  If you are not into 
getting much better MPG (We figured we went from 19 to 23 MPG, back when it was 
$1.35 per gallon for gas we were saving over $800.00 over the 80,000 mile 
longevity of the engine.  Now at $2.00 per gallon it is $1,464.) and double engine 
longevity by being able to keep the engine (-at-)3,000 RPM at higher cruising MPH.  
You will be able to do alot higher MPH than before when flooring it on the 
flats.
  As for comparing hill climbing ability with Clara.  We think it is a bit of 
like comparing apples to oranges, other steeper hills we should be able to 
climb better due to the differance in the lower gears.  Plus we did have our 
camper interior and about four times more swap stuff on board at the time!  The 
real test for us has been by driving the 80+ mile between Olympia and N. 
Seattle and seeing a signifigant drop in time to do this route even with our 1963 SC 
with FF tranny being under powered with a big bore 40 HP engine.  
  It seems the big problem with tranny gearing is the drivers expectation.  
Because of this, when you install a FF tranny, only to find you need more 
power.  You can always build a bigger engine.
