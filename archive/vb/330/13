Subject: RE: Double Cab Bows

Hello Everyone
 
    Where does one find the setup for bows and canvas for a double cab. I
was thinking of just bending some square or round stock and buying the wood.
But where to find the canvas and for how much. If some one has just got
theirs setup what does it all cost?
 
 
TIA
Eric
