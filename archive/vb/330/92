Hey Beto,

Why not just switch to big nut reduction boxes?  That
should give you just enough gearing to cruise at 70 or
so w/o much expense.  Heck, if I get a chance to
remove some, I'll give them to you.  I can cruise at
70 in my 1600/small nut in the '59 SO-23, but I
probably am winding out pretty bad.  The 1800/3.44/bug
4th gear set I'm using now does get me down the road
pretty well, even if the stroker lost me 3rd gear on
the earlier non-welded trans!
