dylan, the actual operation of a swing axle transaxle is pretty darn
simple. Where some of these rebuilders shine is they understand what
they can use from a core and what is junk. Check out the some of the
things on longenterprises.com the rebuilder course is not a bad
investment if you want some more info. I was planning on rebuilding
mine, but decided to just get a rancho rebuild from oldvolks. I have
been very happy with this transaxle, with 35k miles on it (ish).
