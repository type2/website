Hi Mjhenks,
If this is going to be a driver engine and not a museum piece....  Go with a 
later bigger diameter pulley like the one used on the DP 1971 bus engine!  The 
1963-67 Workshop Manual VW Transporter mentions using a larger pulley No. 211 
105 251 in section M-6, page 6.  Also note the head fin drilling shown there 
you should do to keep the heads cooler!!

  The stock paper covered fresh air tubes that go from the shroud through the 
rear engine tin to the muffler are much more stiffer than ones without the 
paper or are you talking about the heater tubes, but those do not pass through 
engine tin!

Do you need really the front apron or the rear (Front is Front!).  If it is 
the front you might want to install a doghouse cooler and shroud for cooler 
running #3 cylinder.  Yes, it can be put on a 40 HP engine!  This would mean 
using a doghouse front tin.  If so make sure to run 33, 34 or better yet 35mm 
(inside measurement) wide cooling fan.  If no dog house make sure to run at least 
a 29mm 1600 SP cooling fan.

There were two sizes of 40 HP intake manifolds.  Are you using the smaller 
diameter earlier type or the later larger type?  Measure your intake openings in 
the heads to make sure or head part #...

Send us the list of mags you have please!
Thanks,
Eric&Barb
