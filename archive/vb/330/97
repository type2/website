Wow, that's a heartwarming story! It's stories like this that remind me
why I risked everything I owned to become part of the Bus community on a
full-time basis. Sometimes on a down day, when I've just finished
dealing with an irate customer who reamed me a new a__hole over
something that wasn't even my fault, I wonder what I'm doing here. But
then I see stories like this, or meet similar people myself, and in
their kindness they put it all in perspective. There really is something
about the Bus community as a whole that you just don't find in most
walks of life. Your story made my day.
