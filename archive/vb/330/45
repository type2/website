If everything checks out OK and it still pulls and squeals take a good 
look at the brake shoes. I've had defective new brake shoes twice (not 
from Ron or Ronnie). If the shoes feel oily or wet they're suspect. 
Shoes are cheap enough that it might be worth it to try another set. If 
that fixes the problem you probably won't have any trouble returning the 
original set.

If the shoes are old you should just replace them. I wouldn't waste any 
time trying to clean old brake shoes.
