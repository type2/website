I second Rob's notion. I have a stack of carbs on the bench now, most
suffering from fuel or air circuit clogging. Changing your rubber fuel
line to prevent debris from the fuel line inner wall flaking off and
getting into the carb and new fuel filters.

I'd check out the carb's idle circuit is clear/operating first.....is
the idle mixture screw having any effect when you turn it? If not,
there's a blockage in the idle circuit.  Overchoking will mask this
condition too.
