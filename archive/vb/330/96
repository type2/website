Subject: 2nd gear pops out

   Time for me to chime in. Give me a call and we can discuss driving habits, engine size, bus load, normal climate in 
your area and I can figure out which trans greaing is best for you.
  I have a different geared trans in 6 of my driving buses with different engines in each also. I have swapped engines 
into different buses to see what the difference would be, yadaa yadaa yadaa. I have probaly tried more gear and 
engine combo's in split buses then anybody (driven them 1000's of miles in testing), never 2 the same and pretty much 
which combo's work best in each situation.  
  Currently testing a straight axle with 4.12 r/p 1.23 (approx) 3rd and .89 4th having a 3.88 built with a 1.31 (approx) 
3rd and an .77 4th to help compensate for the 25 inch tall tires in the rear.
  Also am having a 3.44 r/p with the 1.23 (approx) and .89 4th to mate to a 1600 with duel SCAT solex kit engine (my 
favorite trans gearing) 

I love gear ratio's and buses
