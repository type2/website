I got that "FF" 3.88 R&P in my 65 with big nut RGBs... if you go that route 
I'd recommend a bigger motor than a 1600.  Maybe it's cause my 65 is a westy 
with all the weight of the camper kit plus I often haul stuff around,  but I'm 
not impressed with the FF/big nut/1600 combo in terms of oomph.  The people who 
like the FF tend to have bigger motors.  I could pull the Nisqually Hill in 
my 61 (early 64 gearing) full of swap stuff at 60 that Veewee111 was losing 
speed on with their camper with big nut FF & 1641.

If the bus will have the 1.39 RGBs and/or a bigger motor, that's different.
