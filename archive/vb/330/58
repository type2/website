As a side not to that, I have had a lot of the colored neoprene intake
manifold seals on DP loosen up after a few hundred miles. On my vehicles
I usually tighten the straps during the 500 mile retorque. The factory
black rubber intake manifold seals don't loosen up like that normally,
but once they are tightened down the second time they stay tight.

Hi Jim,
The fact the choke was adjusted to be on all the time screams bad
jetting in
the carb and/or perhaps badly adjusted.  Suggest you take the carb apart
and
throughly clean it out and check the jet sizes and compare them to the
stock
ones for 1969-70ish bus.  Which should be close to what you need.  Also
would be
good to know if you are using a stock oil bath aircleaner, muffler,
distributor, etc...
  Having the choke on all the time is not good for MPG or engine
longevity. Eric&Barb
