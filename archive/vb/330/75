Subject: More 40hp (1200cc) parts needed.

Thanks to all who helped me find my distributor. 
Steve Harris hooked me up with one.  A few more parts
i am looking for.

These are all for a stock 1200cc 40hp bus motor.

Lower pulley.  (That is not warped)
Fresh air steel adapter hoses from muffler up thru
front apron.  (can these be bought new)
Air cleaner triangle hanger bracket.
single port manifold.

Still have the "Hot VW" and "VW & Porsch" mags.  They
are nearing the trash so someone please take them. 
70's- 90's misc. issues.  I have a list.

Hope to get the motor done next month.

Thanks
