Subject: Re: [VB] (bad leak) too much oil?

If there is gas in the oil that is leaking (or the oil remaining in the
engine): I've also had this happen to me when the automatic choke isn't
working or mis-adjusted so that it stays closed. Mixture stays rich all
day and the extra gas will eventually raise the oil level to the point
of  engine damage if not caught in time.
