Subject: Things to do or see along I-80 and I-94?

Greetings from a new list member. My first post...

I bought a 1964 Kombi on eBay and will be traveling to Ohio on June 26
with my (adventurous) 12 y/o daughter to pick it up. We'll be driving
it home along I-80 to Chicago, then up I-94 back to Fargo, ND. We have
six days, so even in a split bus we should have some time to stop for
fun stuff. I kidded her I had heard of a half-day tour of the
Volkswagen Brake Shoes Through the Years Museum, but she didn't seem
enthused about that one. 

Can anyone along that route suggest some "real" interesting things to
see or do? We have already negotiated a trade of Six Flags for MoFoCo
in Milwaukee, but that's just one day of the six we have. Any help will
be much appreciated.
