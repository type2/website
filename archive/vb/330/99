Subject: Re: [VB] 2nd gear pops out

I wasn't meaning to put your bus down or anything like that.  I thought it 
was fair to compare the two laden buses (no yours didn't have 4X the load mine 
did), and point out the higher geared one slowed down on that hill in 4th gear. 
  it may well go faster on the flat.
   likewise... I notice hills in the 65 that I don't in the 61, the 65 is 
geared higher.  Even comparing an empty (cept the camper kit) 65 to a laden 61.   
It's just what higher gearing does.  (unles you increase the engine size.. 
using more butter with the bigger piece of bread)

As for comparing hill climbing ability with Clara.  We think it is a bit of 
like comparing apples to oranges, other steeper hills we should be able to 
climb better due to the differance in the lower gears.  Plus we did have our 
camper interior and about four times more swap stuff on board at the time!
