Ditto to most everyone's remarks.

I have experience with both ends of the spectrum....I'm currently at a crossroads right at the moment.
My previous 63 EZ Camper was purchased with a stock 1600DP, 3:88 Rancho tranny with big-nut redux boxes and 215/75/15's on the back.  Excellent on the flats, hills just killed me.  Even the slight grades.  But then again, you are ususally able to get a good running start to the hills with the FF.  Sweet spot was around 63-65mph.  70+ was no problem, and I did it quite a bit.

Last year, I slapped a Ronnie 1800cc stroker and man o man....what a setup.  Many roadtrips at 75-80 mph.  Hills still posed a threat, but nothing compared to the 1600cc.

63EZ is now in Japan and the 1800 stroker is mated to a stock small nut tranny in my 60Std.  205/75/15's this time around.  Wound out at 60-65, but damn, accelerates like a bat outta hell!  Contemplating keeping the stock tranny for the acceleration, and around town driving. This bus is my daily driver. I think I can deal with a 60-65 crusing speed.  We'll see after the entire inside is dynamatted.

Follow the advice given, stock 1600cc...stay with a stock geared tranny.  1776 and above, you'll probabaly be happy with the FF.

It all depends on how you drive your bus.  We took a lot of 1000+ mile roadtrips, fully loaded in my 63 Camper, so the FF was great.
