Yup, that's too much oil and probably occurred when the oil was filled
when the engine was not level and thus gave a false reading on the
stick. Normally you can get away with a little overage if your engine is
tight and the front seal is in excellent condition. I get some leakage
out of the pully area on one engine that doesn't have a sand seal
because I park on a steep driveway.

Looked outside the other day and there's an oil
puddle, looks like about 12 to 16 FL. oz. of oil,
leaked enough to make about a 10-inch wide stain, and
run about 2-feet down the drive way. It looks like
it's leaking from between the engine and tranny.
so I checked the dipstick and the oil line is
about 1/2 inch above the top (second) line on the
dipstick.
Is that too much oil? How would that happpen?
