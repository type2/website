Yo volks

So is WW the only place that sells the Choke Cable for my 60 bus?  It appears
that they want $45.00 for 2 and another $45.00 to ship em.  Those are Canadian
prices ... so that $90.00 is maybe ... 75 U.S. - but still - that seems like
way too much - not that I can't afford it ... but I hate getting ripped off.
Does anyone else sell things things?
