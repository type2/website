Subject: EarlyRe: type 1 alternator bearing failure and a Friday Funny 

Was writ:  "The bearings are probably "offshore " cheapies."

The bearing on mine was not the issue, it's the front of the alt. itself that
is wollowed out where the bearing is supposed to be seated. There is 1/8"
extra clearance worn into it.  Bearing is fine.
