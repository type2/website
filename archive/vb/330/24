Subject: RE: Double Cab Bows

    Thank you for the information Tom, Curt and everyone that has replied. I
am going to pick up my Double cab this weekend. So I am looking at what this
truck is really going to cost me. I think I would like to have the hoops and
bows made or build myself at roof level. But I will need to by the canvas
top.

 

Thanks Again,

Eric Lykens
