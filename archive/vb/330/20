I may be slow, but I'm not stoopid! I'm not quitting my day job, but I would
be an idiot & a dis-service to the VW vendoring volks if I didn't fairly
price my products for the market & for a return on investment!!!

Made it 1400 miles to OCTO & back before my points, condenser & coil fried
themselves on my new engine, probably from having my stereo fused so that
the key had to be on for it to play? (played stereo/i-pod while engine was
off???) Carried spare points, but no coil or condenser.  Live & learn.

Tom Buese-63 DC-forgive Curt for wasting bandwidth on Ewetah stuff-he
doesn't know any better!  grin
