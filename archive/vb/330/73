Subject: ~150 miles later.... and brakes.

Volk-a-maniacs,

Well, I am back.  No brake or bearing issues.  Annie ran great.  I love
driving my bus.  I even camped on Saturday night.  She kept me safe and warm.

Thanks for the replies on bearings and the information on brake 'shoes'.  I'll
order the bearings right away and get them replaced.

Happy busing and I hope to see you on the roads.
Greg
