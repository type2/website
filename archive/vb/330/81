Ditto on going with a Rancho from Ronnie - I did that about 2yrs ago and 
have been very happy with it.  Ronnie was very helpful and the tranny is 
going strong.  As the list knows all too well (from my loads of quavering 
posts), I yanked the tranny, rebuilt the RGBs, but let Rancho handle the 
tranny.
