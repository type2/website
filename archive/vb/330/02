Subject: Re: [VB] '65 front wheel cylinder connecting brake line

when I'd got new ones, they were straight, and I careful bent them into shape 
with rags on the vise grips.

I had got NOS lines, which are the right length, and also had the local brake 
shop make them..  Rapid Brake used 12mm nuts instead of 11mm, but no big 
deal, my flare wrench was 11mm/12mm anyway.  call yr local good brake shop.

My questions to the list are A: Does anyone know where he could get 
these lines new, pre-shaped and ready to bolt on?
B: Does anyone know a source for the proper length straight brake line 
for this job (or a source for custom length lines)?

Your help is appreciated -Jeff
