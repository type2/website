Hi Shawn,
Best not to take off the hands!  We have done that and all too often it 
results in the hands not going back on with a press fit or the shafts pulling out 
of the gears in back and again not going back together with a press fit.  So 
now we only take the hands off in cases where the face is a complete mess.  
Otherwise we paint the hands and inner face in situ.
