Subject: engine tin

My 40hp engine doesn't have the tin that protects the pushrod tubes - I drove
it for years with no apparent problems - but last year one of the long studs
that holds the rocker arm stuff on came loose (one head had long studs and the
other had short.)  Think the lack of that underneath engine tin was a factor?
Does that underneath engine tin help in cooling?
