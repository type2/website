Does anyone on the list here have any Empi gauges?  More importantly do you
have the correct sender?  I have the gauges but no sender.  I need to modify
some other sender to make my gauges work and was hoping to get some reading
from a original Empi sender.

Please Pmail me if you have any information.

Thanks,
Dan
