Subject: Blowed Up

My 1600 d/p blew up a few days ago. On my way to work I started losing 
power, then two seconds later, POW! klang, klang, klang.

Had the bus towed home and noticed the number four wrist pin had snapped 
letting the rod hammer out two large chunks, top and bottom, out of the 
cylinder. Removed the rocker arm thinking the valve would fall out and 
it seems to be in one piece. The spark plug was mashed, so I figure it 
was piston chunks or maybe one of the valve heads did break and it was a 
cascading failure. Hey, if you're gonna break, do it big.

I bought this long block 'cheep' two months ago tagged as a 'good used' 
slightly refurbished with new rod bearings and rings from my FLAPS as a 
temporary runner while I work on my new engine. Didn't think it would be 
that temporary, however, I only put 2,600 miles on it! :(

It ran great while I had it and gave no indications that it would break. 
Just bad luck, I guess. At least I was only 10 miles from home and not 
on a road trip. I'll post some pics when I get it out and torn down.
