Subject: Re: [VB] Cool tool:  IR thermometer

George, list,
A popular auction site has 'em. I saw one at RadioShaft 
that didn't have the cool laser pointer in it.  
Different surfaces at the same temp may indicate a 
different temp reading due to either magic or physics. 
No problem if you're comparing tin to tin, sump today 
with sump yesterday, etc. I suppose one could measure a 
SO's forehead as they hear of your latest acquisition! 
Hmmm, could help at the poker game. (note to self, build 
a pair of IR poker sunglasses)
To be really useful it would have to record or send a 
reading to the helm from the engine room. Just some 
random thoughts.
