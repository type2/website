Subject: RE: [VB] "Kamax/VERBUS bolts?

13/16" * 2.54 == ~20 so you found some 8x20 mm bolts.  13mm head says they
are from a post '60 truck.  8x20s are used in a number different places from
the rear splash pans, gate latches, bumper bracket to bumper, etc. etc.  in
other words, a very common bolt.  I'd say if you stashed those bolts along
with the rear seat hardware, they are from the gate latches that are bolted
to the back of the cab.


BTW, I've never been able to pinpoint just when they switched from 14 to
13mm head 8mm bolts... anyone know or maybe we can have a pole from people
with 59-61 busses to see when that might have occurred.

It was asked: While looking for the wing nuts & assorted hardware to
install the rear seat of the dc,I found in the bag
with the wing nuts, 4 same size bolts with nuts. head
size is 13.

They are 13/16th long, (what is the metric?) Three are
Kmax, the other is marked VERBUS with the # 86 under
it.

David, have you found some of these? Where would they
be used? It's been along time since taking this truck apart.
