I agree.  The idiot book will get you down the road.  I did my first
engine rebuild on a 36hp back in ought 74 or so using the idiot book.  I
don't use it much now, but every now and then I might look for an
"alternative" way to do something.  Sometimes I just read it for fun. Not
that the Bentley isn't the last word.:)  When it comes to purchasing
busses I'm afraid I use part of Muir's advice, but not necessarily the
cold hard evaluation.
