Subject: RE: [VB] Legalities of stamping an engine case

But I'm not doing it to claim that it is the og motor... I'd always state it
was restamped.  I'm not ashamed!  Maybe I could stamp the 'H' upside down
;-)

I don't see why it would be illegal.  Immoral, yes, if you were to sell
the vehicle and claim it was the "original engine".

Legal... illegal... morality... these are all frames of mind.
