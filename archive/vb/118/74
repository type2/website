Subject: hazetguy's strange engine trouble

Jon,
Is the bad idling only on a cold start, or a warm start too?
Are the sparks from your plugs the good blue-white or the weak yellow?
Trying to think of possible explanations, however far-fetched and 
potentially scientifically unsound. My best so far is this: what if your 
battery and wiring wasn't delivering enough current to make a good spark 
right after starting? The engine might run poorly on a weak spark until the 
generator joined in to produce enough current to overcome a bad battery or 
some bad wiring and give you a good clean spark at the plugs?
2 and 4, huh? It couldn't be something to do with the way the air/fuel moves 
down the intake manifold that messes with those two cylinders?
Must be the oxygen sensor...
