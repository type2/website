High oil pressure followup

I just pulled the oil pressure relief and control springs and measured them
(unloaded):
Pressure relief (rear) 80mm
Pressure control (front) 30.5mm
My '63-'67 Workshop Manual says that the unloaded length of the pressure relief
spring should be 62-64mm. But that is for a single relief case, mine is a dual
relief. I have a VWOA "Official Service Manual" for the '68-'78 bus, doesn't
give an unloaded length for the pressure relief spring but says loaded the
length should be 39mm (1972+) or 44mm (1970, 1971). I can compress it that far,
but just barely, the spring coils are almost closed at that point.

So what is the unloaded length of a stock dual relief case oil pressure relief
spring? Oil control spring?

Oil temperature has not been a problem, I run at 180-200F depending on the
weather. I haven't experienced the dipstick too hot to hold, so I am assuming my
temperature gauge is telling the truth. I've even tried Clara's test a couple of
times and the spit doesn't sizzle.
