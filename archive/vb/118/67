Hi Rick,
Then break out or buy the Bentley reprint of the 63-67 bus shop manual!  You 
have to drain the RGB and center section of the tranny at the same time.  
Then refill both RGBs and then the tranny center section.  Remember to use 
only GL-4 gear oil in 90 or 80/90 WT.  Replacing all non-magnetic tranny/RGB 
plugs with magnetic ones will help keep the steel shavings from working over 
the bearing constantly.
