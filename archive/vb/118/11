As I was restoring and customising by '63 bus I started using it more =
and more. The joy of really DRIVING a vehicle as well as the comments =
and the whole experience of owning the bus became my everyday thing =
instead of a second vehicle. Then it became my shop truck as I =
discovered that the bus was much more practical than my other vehicles.

I began working on my suspension to make the steering better and found =
that the spindle was binding and needed to come apart. To Wolfgang's =
credit they sent another spindle immediately - no charge ( I didn't even =
have to send in the bad one first). But while I have the front end apart =
I haven't been able to use the bus

I own a '90 Mitsubishi Montero, and it has been a very good truck and =
done all I asked of it, but it developed a computer glitch that, despite =
$300, has never been right. Also I needed a starter and after trying for =
3 hours I couldn't get out more than one bolt and had to have the Mitz =
towed to the shop. Another $300 for a simple starter replacement. =
Anyway, I have had to go back to the Montero as a shoptruck for awhile.

What a bummer! 8' lumber fits inside of the bus. I have to tie it to the =
roof rack of the Montero. The bus is roomy in the cargo area and =
everything fits so that I can reach in and get stuff. In the Montero =
tools and materials have to be stacked and I can't ever find anything. I =
can't even get some of my tools into the Montero. All this even though =
the back seat has been taken out.

I can't wait to move back into the bus.

My wife has a fancy society car and I have my bus. The Montero, which =
most people would consider more valuable and realistic than the bus, is =
a backup and tow vehicle. All this by natural progression. The bus =
earned and took it's place all by itself.

So, yeah, the bus has changed my life.
