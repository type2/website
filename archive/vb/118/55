yup, that's why I do the work on my own bus.   I paid a shop to fix my bus 
once a long time ago, and got a big bill and a not fixed bus.   That 
reeeeeally bites.   So get yourself a pair of overalls, a watch cap,  idiot 
book, a bentley and some tools, and you will grow to appreciate the bus even 
more.   You may even want to get a box of  disposable latex gloves for easy 
clean up. (your wife might appreciate it).

I know some people laugh at the Idiot book, but I still have the one I got 
about 15 years ago, duct taped together with grease marks on it and notes I'd 
written on the pages- and I still use it.

The clutch problem is either a stretched cable, so buy a new one and pull out 
the old one and look for where it is separating.  if the old cable is bad, 
put in the new and you should be fine (grease cable when installing)

If the old cable is good- no frays anywhere,  hey its good to have a spare 
clutch cable anyway.   you will need to pull the engine to inspect the clutch 
and throw out arm/bearing.    

 You may want to check your main oil seal and oil cooler seals and replace 
the fuel line, engine to body seals etc at the same time.
