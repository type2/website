Subject: Flat-Four-Fetish VW Show-- May 11-12

After an oil change from the Route 66 run last week, Bessie hit the road
again to Prescott, Az-- For the annual Show-N-Shine--
Just 102 miles North of Phoenix, and about 5500 feet up the hill--What a
VWonderfull week-end in the tall pine country--Saturday night they block off
the Court House square for All the VWs--Just a grand time of some 50+ VWs
just hanging out telling lies and sharing good times with all the people who
come to look at the VWs--Plenty of places to eat just steps away on all the
street side cafes--Prescott is a fun town--we had the Hamburger Special at a
local diner, that was almost a half pound of meat and fries for just 3.00
bucks!!Splittie buses were out in force!!

Sunday morning the weather again was Vantastic--85+ Vws in the Show on the
Grass at the Mile High School grounds--Again the splittie was in force--Lots
of very cool rides--Double door deluxe--two very early double cabs--
Raffles -- slow drags-- fun and games for the little kids and Big kids and a
Special Mother's Day game in which all the men and boys took a shot at
winning something for Mom!! Car show had at least 30 splitties-- I even
found some treasures in the Swap Meet--T-Shirts were made on location--A
very relaxed Top 20 awards + about 6 extra Special classes--One group
brought 12 cars from Las Vegas!! Show ended at about 2PM on Sunday -- seemed
like it was over way to fast as everyone was having a great time--One of the
few shows I have been to that followed a time schedule!! Thank You FFF for
another VWonderful Week-End.

 This is a great show put on by even greater people--Same time next year--be
there!!
