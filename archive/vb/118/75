Subject: oil pressure concern

Bus is running as well as ever. I am just worrying, I think.
I put in oil pressure and oil temperature gauges a week or two ago. The 
temperature is just fine, but the oil pressure gauge needle spends a lot of 
time at 90+psi beyond the scale on the gauge. Idle pressure is what I expect 
it to be, ~40psi cold and ~20-30psi hot, but cruising 3000+rpms puts the 
needle off the scale. I drove almost 300 miles on thursday, the engine was 
definitely warmed up, and the oil pressure stays high. I thought the oil 
pressure would drop as the oil got hotter and thinner. I have never had an 
oil pressure gauge before, I don't know what the readings ought to be, but 
it doesn't seem right that a gauge should be reading off the scale like 
that. If it were the temperature gauge I would be alarmed. Instead I am just 
confused. It has been a while since something broke of its own accord, maybe 
I am just getting itchy to wrench on something...
Other notes: 30-weight oil, ambient temperatures in the 70-80's. Oil 
pressure sender is one of those VDO dual sender units that replaces the 
stock low oil pressure sender. Oil cooler isn't leaking, I'm not losing any 
noticeable amount of oil. Two pressure relief plungers slid right out, I 
could see light scoring on them to indicate they had been moving up and 
down. I should have measured the springs, but I was in a hurry and didn't. 
They certainly put a lot of downward push on the bolts as I struggled them 
back in.
