Has the bus changed my life??
Without a doubt.  I find my bus is a stress reliever. If i'm having a bad 
day, just hop in the bus and go driving around. I love seeing the smiles on 
peoples faces when they see me coming. It's great. They are pretty rare 
where i live. Probably the best thing about my bus is the relationship it 
brings with my dad. He has one too. Vw busses have brought us very close 
together. He has a 71 and i have a 67.  For some reason, everytime we are 
talking on the phone we always get into a vw converstation. Never one of 
those dull conversations where we are just waiting to hang up and get on 
with our life that we use to have. Even though we live far apart, and lead 
very different lives, we have something in common to talk about. Yes i love 
my bus.
