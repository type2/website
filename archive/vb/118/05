Subject: King pin rebuild

Hi All,

I'm rebuilding the king and link pins on the 67 tipper in prep to drive it
1000+ miles down to LA for the octo/classic weekend (wish me luck).  I put
together a page on the progress.  Mid next week the front end should be back
together....

...and of course, there is some obligatory bolt fetish included :-)

Enjoy.
David
