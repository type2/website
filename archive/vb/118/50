Subject: Looking for Door Pull Screws & Washers for My '67

I must be in the early stages of DMS (David Mayes Syndrome). I find myself
repeatedly disappointed in replacement parts that either don't look like the
originals or don't have the quality of the originals. I have the inside door
pulls for my '67 Deluxe, but not the screws and washers to mount them on the
doors. The fasteners I've seen on buses with repro door pulls look just like
the screws and washers sold for mounting the interior door and wall panels
(and they're wrong for that, too, since they have a Phillips head instead of
slotted and the washers are bagel-shaped instead of conical  -- oops, there
I go again!) So, does anyone out there have any extra bigger, original-style
screws and washers for '66-'67 inside door pulls? Yes ... I've resorted to
pawing through rusty coffee cans of bits and pieces at the few local shows,
but it seems people save the handles but not the hardware. Any help will be
appreciated!
