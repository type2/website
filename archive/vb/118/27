Subject: big boy toys

Well for once a productive week,I finally got my compressor moved to my
house and wired up, now I can bead blast and finish the heads for my '69.
What took so long you ask, well I'll tell you even if you didnt. This sucker
stands over 6 feet high and weighs more than a bug. Lets just say there was
a lot of excitement when this puppy started to tip on the ramp out of the
truck.

Plus it looks like I'll get a start on a ramp truck. No more tow dollies for
this boy. Made a ridicules offer on a Dodge L600 tilt truck and darn if they
didnt take it. Coolest thing is this has split windows also so a bus will
feel right at home. Now all I need is a ramp body, anybody got one laying in
your back yard ? ; )

fun from the island
