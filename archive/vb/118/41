Run the engine with #2 removed, or with a spare plug in #2
but with the plug wire attached to the grounded plug, which
should verify the spark and present the problem as described.
Try a smaller gap on #2 to prevent fouling from oil problems.
Otherwise, if you can now verify to your satisfaction the source of
the problem is misfire on #2, then it should be simple to correct.
If the plug fires when removed, it should fire the same installed.
It is possible that spark is going to ground, should be visible in
the dark, run it with the plug seal off and look down the wire.
You will be amazed how many misfires and sparks to ground you will find.
If conditions present different symptoms, then you will need to
look elsewhere. Verify the compression.
