trying to point out in my post yesterday. I'll be surprised if we ever
know what SK stands for, but I think we can pretty much rule out
"Special Kolor". It just doesn't make any sense that they would make up
a word like that.<<

I, too, spectulated in a NEATO Old Bus Review article several years ago
that SK came from Sonder and Kolor.  I was rebuffed on several fronts
until last year.  In communication with Dave Eccles, who is the author
of the "Spec Guide" which came out several years ago and author of the
new edition of the "Spec Guide" about to be released, he came back with
a reference to a 1963 dealer SO catalog which refers to Westfalia camper
two-tone color combinations as

Farbsonderkombination

and then lists Skxxxx followed by paint names.  If we're using logic,
Farb (color) Sonder (special) and Kombination (combination!) could be
FSK, but why use the "F" in a place on the M-Code plate designated for
color?  It would be redundant.

I'm with John Kyte, SonderKombination.
