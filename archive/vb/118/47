I've noticed that about most ACVW owners.  Myself included.  Is it some
kind of insecurity?  Maybe just good logic to have plenty of backups.
I have three now and I'd camp in any of them.  Might not want to drive the
newest one very far though.  If I can get the new T4 in the bug so I can
move that out of the way, then put the 2L in the 58 so I can keep up with
people like JP, Ronnie, then pull the tranny again on the 67 because it
still pops out of reverse, and I don't even want to think about the 62
Riviesty just yet.......
