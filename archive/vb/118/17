Subject: Re: [VB] Cool tool:  IR thermometer

Just remember with most of these temp readers, they 'fan out' quite a bit.
My friends IR thermometer spread to a 1 foot diameter at just 6 inches away
(and read the average).  So if you want something specific, you do have to
get it pretty close to it.    They are very useful tools.  Probably the kind
that after you own it, you wonder how you managed without it.
