Well, I tightened the wing nut about an inch or so. (that is much
adjustment compared to past of one turn or two) Getting some resistance
at clutch.

 

Cranked engine with clutch out. OK.. 

Try to push clutch in to hear that bad sound of something scrubbing
against a moving part. Arggggh.

 

I will have to get it towed or something. Just had new clutch two
thousand miles ago. (For any that remember my mechanic couldn't figure
out the drums were out of tolerance and I kept loosing all brakes
because the left rear slave cylinder would come apart. He also replaced
my clutch due to a broken clutch actuation fork)

 

Any Ideas ????

Any idea how to pacify a wife frustrated with an old VW?

 

Thanks!
