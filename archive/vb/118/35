There has to be someone who knows. Too bad there isn't
anyone that worked at the factory that is a split bus
enthusiast today. Then maybe all of the questions
could be answered. Say a 18 year old guy got a job at
the factory in 59, that would only make him 61 years
old. Too bad someone's grandpa from Bulli Kartei
coulnd't unlock these mysteries.
