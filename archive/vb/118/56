I am at the point where I need to perform maintenance on the gear reduction 
boxes and the tranny.  On the my 59 I am assuming it is all original so I 
would be looking for maintenance on this set up. I want to drain and replace 
all the fluids in both, and make sure they are ready for any cruises this 
summer may bring my way.
