Subject: Re: [T2] How do you remove oil filler piece?

I use a piece of metal bar stock which has
the end notched to fit the tubular nut, and
turn it with vise-grips. More often than not
it requires heat to start the nut, as the surface
area of grip is not sufficient to overcome the resistance.
Heat must be applied carefully to prevent melting the filler tube.
Lubricants like CRC or Kroil help. Pretty simple otherwise.
