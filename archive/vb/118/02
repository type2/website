I'll buy that. Farbsonderkombination makes sense. And dropping the F makes sense too, since it's obvious that color is what the code is all about.

I got a good laugh out of the way David Mayes managed to twist this thread to fit his og bolt fetish. 8^)

And Robert, What thread was more boring than this one? No wait, don't remind me, it might take it a week to die down again. 8^) It's been fun digging in the minutia (it *is* minutia, right? Not manuer?) and I think we actually got somewhere with it this time.
