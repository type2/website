Subject: "Kamax/VERBUS bolts?

While looking for the wing nuts & assorted hardware to
install the rear seat of the dc,I found in the bag
with the wing nuts, 4 same size bolts with nuts. head
size is 13.

They are 13/16th long, (what is the metric?) Three are
Kmax, the other is marked VERBUS with the # 86 under
it.

David, have you found some of these? Where would they
be used? It's been along time since taking this truck apart.
