Subject: R-V - Thanks & June OCTO invite

R = Reserviert (reserve)




Thanks to all for the replies! BMW 2002's are cool cars if you move the gas tank 
from between the rear bumper and the rear axle somewhere else. This advice 
coming from people who regularly put their pedal extremities between the front 
axle and the oncoming traffic! 




Rihard Barker is the winner of a brew pub pint. (winner must show up to claim 
prize after the June OCTO show or any time between now and the next millenium in 
Fresno, CA) 




There are better translators than Babel. Check www.google.com for sites. I found 
one that would take either Deutsch or English, with usage in phrases and 
slang... http://dict.tu-chemnitz.de/




Just a reminder... I'll buy every listee a pint or two after the June OCTO. 
C'mon down and bankrupt me instead of bankrupting yourself at the toy/literature 
show!
