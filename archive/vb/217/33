Subject: [busalert] 87 Westfalia Recovered!

Our 1987 Blue Westfalia California (L# 2JUY726) was stolen 2/21-22, 2003 at
a 
Hilton in Garden Grove, and it was recovered a few miles away in Anaheim on
Friday night. The suspects, a 17 year-old, and an 18 year-old male, were
arrested when they were pulled over for failure to stop for a pedestrian.
Sadly, they were gang members, and the exterior and interior of our van were
scratched and painted with gang graffiti. The dash is ruined, stereo ripped
out, table crudely cartooned, back seat slashed open, ceiling defaced, etc.
So sad to see the senseless vandalism. Most of our stuff is gone, including
my camera. They had garage openers and lots of keys in the glove box-a
regular rolling gang-mobile. Don't know yet if the insurance company will
fix 
or total it.
