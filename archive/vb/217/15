Michel,
	Most on this list will tell you that the dual circuit master 
cylinder is a great and a modern improvement over the old single circuit 
units.  The obvious answer is that there is a safety or backup circuit.  
In my experience I've found that the single M/Cs give a lot of warning 
before they fail.  The pedal gets lower, you may need to pump it a bit 
in the morning....   Dual M/Cs lose one circuit and many drivers, say my 
wife (true story), never notices this.   You probably will not hook up 
the "brake fail" warning light on a retrofitted old bus.  When the 
"safety" circuit, the second one goes, it goes all at once and often 
with little or no warning.  Also, the larger bore of the single M/C 
seems to still work when the bore becomes damaged by rust, whatever.  
Again, it will tell you something is wrong.  The smaller dual M/C bores 
do not work when encountering a like amount of damage.  How many on this 
list have tried to rebuild the dual M/Cs on their '67 and found that 
they didn't work at all or failed in short time.  Hone out a single M/C, 
drop in new parts and it most likely will work just fine.  Gary Gibson
