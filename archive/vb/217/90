Hello All     Be careful with the big ass circlip. I have seen these put in 
backwards and pop out . If you think about how they make the circlips they 
stamp them out which leaves a flat side and a rounded side. Always put the 
flat side out. this also applies to the piston clips that are on the type 4 
motors. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service SALEM Va
