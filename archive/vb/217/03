Aha!  If you plugged the three wires you had on the old turn signal
flasher onto the three prongs on this flasher, this could well be
the source of your weirdness.  On this flasher, 31 should be grounded,
and none of the three wires at the turn signal flasher on a '65 is
a ground wire.  (The ground connection shown on the wiring diagram
was done via the mounting clip.)

The flasher you have should be hooked up as follows:

The connector with a black/green/white and black/purple wires coming
out of it should go to +49 (or just +).  This is the feed from the
battery.

The connector with two black/green/white wires coming out of it, AND
the solid blue wire, should go to 49a.  You can get adapters that have
one female push-on and two male push-ons, or you can make up a short
harness, or whatever.  This is the pulsing voltage to the exterior
lamps (black/green/white wires) and speedometer indicator (blue wire).

Make up a new ground wire, going from a good ground (one of the parcel
shelf screws, maybe) to 31.

Fix the flasher wiring before tearing into anything else.  I think it
will clear up much of your problem.
