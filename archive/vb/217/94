Hi Curt,
Sounds like the repairs are going well for you.  The price per hour for 
repairs does seem a tad high, but it does sounds like they were through.   
Yes, you can replace the RGB bearings yourself with commonly used VW tools, 
though having a few special use tools does make it alot easier.  We got to 
the point with the 1955-63 RGBs that we replaced all of the bearings in one 
of them in less than two hours while at a rest stop just North of Redding in 
less than two hours!  We do wonder if you might need to go to a lesser 
strength clutch which will allow a bit more slippage when the clutch pedal is 
released suddenly and thusly protect the tranny and even engine from the 
sudden shock.  We had a friend who actually snapped the tranny in two pieces 
just forward of the RGB axles due to running a 2 liter type 4 engine and 
letting the clutch out with the engine at high RPM while showing off for some 
friends of his.  Plus it has been shown engines last longer due to less 
shock.  In the autostick bugs the tranny has a hydralic torque converter to 
cushion the shifting.  This results in the well maintained not hot rodded 
engine lasting instead of only 80,000 to 100,000 miles with the standard 
stick shift to quite often 150,000 miles in the autostick bugs/Ghias!
