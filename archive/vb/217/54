Subject: Re: [VB] re wont cold idle

You definitely need to fix the choke *first*. When the engine is cold, it requires a richer mixture
to keep it running. Since your choke is wide open when it is cold, the engine is getting a mixture
that is too lean to keep it running.

When you manually set the choke, you are probably setting it in a position that leans out the
mixture too much and eventually stalls the engine. The electric choke is designed to gradually open
the choke as the engine heats-up.

Fix the choke, set your idle at the correct speed and let us know what happens.

bingo. fix the choke first.
could also be icing, i dont know how the weather is where you are.
if its icing unblocking the risers and hooking up preheat hose is a
solution.

Don't think it's the choke, cuz if I manually goose it, the problem still
persists.

Icing hmmmm?  I have the crappy paper air filter.  What is involved with
"pre-heating" set-up.

Weathers cold.  Colorado winter.  have had this problem anytime under 60
degrees though.  Warmer the weather, the quicker the warm up happens.  Once
warm, idles fine...
