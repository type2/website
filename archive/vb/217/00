Subject: Does anyone have...

or can anyone take a nice high quality digital picture of the pattern found
on the old VW parts boxes?

similar to this pic, http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/pix/113328.jpg

maybe a little closer and with no parts in the pic and preferrably very
little/no glare.

I know it's a lot to ask, but we're all bus people right?  =)

If anyone happens to maybe have that pardicular design in a computer
generated type image, that'd be fine too

TIA
