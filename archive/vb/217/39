Take a look at the wiring diagram for a '71 bus.  There are two
three-terminal switches on the master cylinder, wired in parallel.
One terminal is the feed from the fuse box and the other is the
switched current to the brake lights, just like on a split.  The
third terminal is the "failure" light terminal, which goes to
a light on the dash.  The other side of the light is grounded.
The light also has a feed from the fuse box and I believe this is
for a lamp-test function; there is a button that is part of the
light and wired in parallel with the switches on the master cylinder.
When you hop in the Bus and turn on the key, you're supposed to
push the button and observe that the light comes on, to verify
that the bulb is OK.

On Buses up through '65, with the emergency flasher light to the
left of the speedo, you could use that light for the "brake fail"
light if you disconnected the wire from the emergency flashers
first.  If you wanted to use the light for both the emergency
flasher and the brake fail light, it would be best to use two
diodes to keep things separated.  Either way, you wouldn't have
the lamp-test function, so you can't distinguish "brakes OK"
from "brakes failed and bulb failed".

On '66 and later Buses, with the emergency flasher light in the
switch knob, there's not an easy way to do this.

The Right Thing would be to install a separate lamp with lamp-test
pushbutton, like on a bay-window Bus.
