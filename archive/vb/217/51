Subject: Connecting brake fail circut to emer flasher indicator

Take a look at this diagram and let me know if this would work when connecting the brake fail light
on the dual master cylinder to emergency flasher indicator on a 65 or earlier bus.

                                                      ______
+6V wire from brake fail -------------|____|_|---|
                                                       diode      |
+6V wire from emergency              ______    |------- +6v terminal on
 flasher switch                  -----------|____|_|---|            emergency indicator light
                                                      diode

I guess you could just pull the knob on the emergency flashers to test the bulb, right?
