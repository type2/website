Jason,
The generator needs just a "little juice" from the battery to sustain the 
excitation needed to generate electricity.  Under small loads, it will 
self-excite but once the load is large (low battery), it cannot keep 
up.  With the dome light left on, the battery is good and dead and may not 
be able to hold a charge any longer.

I would put the battery on a charger over night.  A good 10-12 hours.
If it's not a sealed battery, check the water level before charging.

After the charge, it should be able to start the bus.  If not, go get a new 
one.
