Subject: torsion bar/spring plate needed!!!

Listees,

I need the left side torsion bar and spring plate out of a 66 or 67 bus
for my ailing 67 deluxe. I'll pay shipping from anywhere in US. I really
prefer left side components, even though some have said that it doesn't
matter. It's my perfectionist thing. They must be in good condition, no
ovaled holes.
Need'em asap...

Thanks, crew!
