Subject: RE: [VB] OT - R-V vs. E-F

Let's see:

'screwed' translates to 'geschraubt' but I don't think it anticipated
the slang connotation...

'vapors' translates to 'Dampfe'

'soon to walk' is 'bald gehen'

'fill it up' is ' fullen Sie es oben'

'no more' is 'nict mehr'


geez, I dunno...  maybe 'Retard' is a universal word!

Harry pondered:
...My son has a '74 BMW 2002 and is asking what the R-V on his gas guage
is auf Deutsch (in German). I know "Voll" is full, but find only "Leer"
for empty in the English-German dictionary.
