It looks like you had a good time with the tranny.
Yes, you can get the RGB bearings one at a time, but I wouldn't 
recommend it. Chips from bad bearings that circulate in the oil cause 
damage to the other bearings in the gearbox, even if you can't see it. 
For a few more dollars you can put all new parts back in the bus.
