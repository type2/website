Adrian,

The best way i have found is to apply something like
liquid wrench to the pin for at least a week, every
day.  Let the stuff soak in.  Then use an air chissle
and drive the pin out from the bottom up.  If you can,
apply heat to the joint as well.  Every one i have
done eventually comes out that way.  Got to be patient
though.  It will not happen in one day.

Matthew
