I believe that the north rim is closed for winter!  It's about 1000 ft
higher than the south rim, spectacular, but closed until they plow the road
in the spring.

I would second the idea of Zion National Park-158 miles from Los Wages-open
this time of year, and even tho it's in Utah, home of the "whacko
survivalists",  pretty cool. Lots of climbers, river & desert rats hang out
there, but this time of year is the perfect time to see it.
