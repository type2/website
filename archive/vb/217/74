Jason had disposable tyvek coveralls, the turkey.  I have a cheap pair of camo pants that never show the grease.  But disposable gloves look better 
all the time.

This was sort of like the sound you'd expect to hear just prior to being abducted by aliens.  Actually a little of both.

>Maybe I am cheap, but I have replaced just bad bearings and kept the good ones.

Who lists the bearings separately?

I don't mind a Muldoon myself (I mean, really, what you're talking about is just being economical, not a kluge).  On the other hand I can understand 
the presidential "with us or against us" felt need to replace them all - especially here, when it's something of a PITA to go back later.  If it were *just* 
the two bearings, I think I'd replace them and hope for the best -- since the tranny's going, too, it changes my thinking.

>ring-... I have a nice pair from Matco, that pretty much only see use on trannys.

Thanks for the rec.

>When you get the axle shafts off inspect the ends.

I think Jason said he had some spare FPs - nice tip about using bug ones.  Again, if any of these items are iffy, it's another argument for the 
"complete" rebuilt unit w/RGBs.

>I make RGB half seals from traceing onto paper grocery bags and cutting them out. using a hole punch

Jason described being in the middle of nowhere and making gaskets for a hydraulic system from a Burger King bag!

Thanks for the tips, Clara - this one's a keeper.
