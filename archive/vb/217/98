Hi Jason,
Having a generator does not mean it generates electricity all the time!  
Depending on the size of both the lower and upper pulleys and even the belt 
size or wear change the RPM of the generator in relation to the RPM of the 
crankshaft in the engine.  Most generators cut-in to provide voltage at 
anywhere between 1,350-1,850 RPM measured at the generator itself.  So if you 
are idling at 800 RPM and have a 1.8:1 or less ratio lower crank pulley....  
Plus your regulator could be adjusted to begin delievering voltage at a 
higher voltage point than it should be!
  Best guess is take out your battery, fill it with distilled water if it is 
not a sealed unit, then try charging your battery.  If it takes a charge then 
try to start your bus with the battery if not get a new battery and tell us 
what happens.
