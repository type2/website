Subject: Re: Grand Canyon

As a (all but the first nine months)native Arizonan, I can say that the Grand
Canyon has at least three views. South Rim, North Rim, and the Collin Fletcher-
down in- looking up view. All three are unique and regulated. South is most
visted and accessible. North is nicer, in my opinon, for summer camping. Hiking
down inside the canyon is a complete trip all unto its self. Save the North for
Summer, the South for long car trips with Grandma wherein you drive forever,
arrive and expect someone to say something such as "that's one big AZ hole!"
Then you hop back into the '66 Electra and cruise home to Phx/Tucson. 
Check for reservations and regulations. Yes, North rim is usually closed for
the brunt of the Winter months.

$200 Dasher running as of today, DMV tomorrow.

Took it for a 5 mile drive and got flipped off 3 times and cut-off twice...
