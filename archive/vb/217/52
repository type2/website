I wonder if this whole VW trademark thing is getting out of hand because of 
a handful of lawyers who are eagerly pursuing the profits and not whether 
VW has really been harmed in anyway. VW should be proud that there is a 
vintage enthusiast following. Free promotion.

Would there be a way to circumvent the lousy lawyers and collection 
agencies and talk to VWOA directly (or better yet VW of Europe) to seek 
cooler heads. Lawyers and collections agencies are most successful when 
they are on their worst behavior.

I was able to settle a debt once quite easily by circumventing a collection 
agency who were treating us terribly over a dinky $35 debt (their fault) by 
going directly to the company and saying hey - why are you treating me - 
the customer - this way? I threw in a quick reminder that my bad opinion 
was going to spread further and faster than they could imagine.

Understand I had to skip about 5 layers of corporate bureaucracy until I 
was able to talk to the CEO's executive assistant. It was an accounting 
error on their part too. (Verizon).

Basically when the operator answers save you breathe and ask to speak to 
their manager. Explain to the manager that the operator did no wrong but 
you want to speak to their manager and so on.

Furthermore you can push it by saying you want on paper signed by a VP or 
better and explanation of how your actions (business sign or drawing) harms 
their business in any way. These collection agencies and lawyers are 
looking for folks that will pony up cash without a fight.

Yesterday a small business in KY named "Victoria's Little Secret" won a 
lawsuit started by "Victoria's Secret" who claimed the small business was 
harming them. The judge said prove it and VC couldn't.
