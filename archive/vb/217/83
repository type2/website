Hi Greg,
Nope!  Single port intake manifolds all (except early 25 HP ones.) have an 
aluminum cast on section that acts as a heat sink to spread evenly the heat 
from the heat riser tubes into the intake manifold tubes to prevent icing.  
This aluminum casting is the area with the part number cast into it.
