The schematic got a little garbled but I think you have it right.  In
words, the striped end of both diodes connects to the indicator light.
The other end of one diode goes to the brake fail switches and the other
end of the other diode goes to the wire from the emergency flasher switch
(the wire that used to be the only one connected to the indicator light).

Pretty much any normal rectifier diode you can easily obtain will work.
Examples are 1N400x where x=1 to 7 and 1N540x where x=0 to 8.

That would check out the bulb, yes.  But what if the diode in the line
from the brake fail switches failed open?  The bulb would test OK but if
the brake fail switches came on you'd get no light...  Of course you
have to stop someplace and accept the risk of undetected failures,
before the wiring harness (and all three volumes of the wiring diagram)
weigh more than a stock Bus.
