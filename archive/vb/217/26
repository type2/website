If your spring plates are okay, not bent or damaged, then renew the rubber
spacers at the cover, keep everything clean and dry, and reassemble. If
you haven't removed the torsion bars or plates, and they look fine, don't
bother - you'll have to reset the angle - which isn't too much of a pain,
but you need to do it right, and have the tools (floor jack, jack stand,
Sears angle indicator, hook-and-eye turnbuckle, and the usual tools).
