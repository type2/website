I am  firm believer in giving credit where credit is due. That said, I would like to publicly thank Jon Furst for taking the time to help me out in acquiring a much needed tool in order finish a project that I had started.

It worked great and I will buy you a beer (Guiness?) at BYOB3. 

Thanks again,

Sean
