Subject: grand canyon

what city is the grand canyon in??? with out going deep into az where can I
get the grreat views and say for camping?

heres my "PLAN OF ATTACK" leave modesto in the morning of the 21st heading to
irwindale for the races the 23, say with family in colton ca. monday after the
show (24th) leave to vegas, stay with family in vegas gamble, have fun check
out the hoover dam. 25th or 26th I would like to leave las vegas and see the
grand canyon but im hesitant cus I will need to back track to get to modesto
so I wouldent want to go to deep in az to check out the canyon then I would
stay in az a day or 2 then trek back the whole day back to home sweet home.
coming from vegas is there any nice scenery of the canyon that aint to far out
of the way?
