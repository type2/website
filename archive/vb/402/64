Subject: need a ride from Circle yer wagons to Memphis

I am on a round USA trip and my wife wants to go to the blues festival at Helena AR. If I get dropped off in Sevierville, I need a ride to Tunica MS or Memphis 

I really want to go, but need a ride after the show. 

Can anyone help please? 

I will help with gas etc.
