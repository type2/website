Two places come to mind:

Peninsula Auto
861 Camden Ave #14
Campbell, CA 95008 (South of San Jose)
(408) 378-7033

Van Cafe (formerly Volks Cafe)
1823 Soquel Ave
Santa Cruz, CA 95062
(831) 426-1244

Both have been around forever it seems and have been excellent in my
dealings with them over the years.
