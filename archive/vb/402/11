Hello, Conrad and greetings from a spring-time South Africa!

We were told in our mechanical appreticeship to simply calculate the 
screw/bolt diameter by 0.8! This would give you the core-hole.

So, by example, a 6mm bolt has a hole drilled of 4,8mm...a 5mm srew/bolt has 
an inner diameter of 4.0mm

I still find this very helpful, if you would have a broken off srew and want 
to drill it out...

Enjoy your weekend!
