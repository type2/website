Hi Volks,
Trying to contact all of those who have talked to or Emailed us over  the 
years.  Barb's Dad passed away this last Friday.  It had been a  long eight years 
and nine months of taking care of him since his first massive  stroke.  
  Now with much more free time on our hands hoping to see  more of all of you 
in our travels,
Eric&Barb
