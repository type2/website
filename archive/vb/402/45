The following items are needed:

211 827 401  Spring Assembly
211 827 409 A  Shouldered Bolt to attached top of Spring to body
N012 230 2  Spring Washer for Shouldered Bolt above
211 827 423  Guide Roller for bottom of Spring
N012 435 1  5mm E-Clip to hold Roller onto Spring

Yes, the components are the same for the Splittie "Treasure" Doors.  And
yes, these components are the same for the engine lid as well 64-71 (72 &
later is similar but different).

Hope this helps.
