Subject: Re: [VB] parts suppliers in Mountain View, CA

Kevin,

Try BugFormance in Sunnyvale. They are on El Camino Real. Just South of Mt. 
View.
They just  rebuilt a trannee for me, about 33 years ago.
Still have the trannee. However it may be the one sitting in my garage. not 
the one in my bus.

suppliers saving me my regular shipping costs... I was also hoping to pick
 up some parts for my bus at home.

Any suggestions or recommendations...
