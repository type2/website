Subject: Re: [VB] Electronic ignition timing...

Dear All,
I have a british-made aftermarket electronic ignition in my 1200.

As we have now ethanol / lead replacement fuel ( sugarcanefuel), I am told, 
that the ignition timing ought to be retarded, less than the recommended 
standard 7,5 degrees.

We usually added approx 3 degrees to compensate for our altitude in 
Johannesburg, ( 6000feet or 1800M above sea level).

Do advise me, please, what settings you would recommend me to try.

Many greetings from a spring-time South Africa!
Your VW friend,
MikeBee
