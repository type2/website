Subject: Valve problem...Whats hapening here?!?!?!

I went to adjust my valves on my 1600 DP today.  ANd
the number 2 valve is giving me a problem.  No matter
how far I back off the adlusting screw, I cannot get a
feeler between.  It's like the valve is sticking so
far out (open) that it is pressing against the rocker
arm where the adjusting screw goes thru.  So WTF is
happening in my engine?????
How bad is the news???

PEACE! John Baker
