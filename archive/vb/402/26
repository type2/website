Hey Rennie,

Good to see you're still out there. Never did do my inner torsion bar 
bushings. Runs really straight with just the new outers. Slide on by 
sometime with that hot crew cab.
Ruby's at the Redondo Pier has a car night every Friday thru the end of the 
month. Had a lot of lookers at my DD Friday before last. Maybe we can make 
it on the 28th? Starts at 5 and runs till about 7 or 7:30. Gettin dark by 
then however. Hope your headlights work.

Chris
