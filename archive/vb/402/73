Subject: Re: [VB] What ever happened to the bus boat?

Stu took his bus apart some some years ago to restore it.
The paint has recently been finished.?? Bunch more work to go before it's back on the road.
He still has the boat. 

I know of no plans to reproduce the boats.

I headed into the library this evening with a 1986 Hot VWs. Mark Walters covers a Pacific Northwest VW show, a 23 window has a cool bus boat mounted on top. He made a comment that someone was going to reproduce them. I think I've seen one since then. Has anyone seen one of these lately??
?
