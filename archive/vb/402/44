Subject: treasure chest doors...

I am looking for parts for my '69. I know this is the vintage list, but the
parts look identical, and I think they are.

 

The engine lid and the treasure chest doors/lids are held up by a spring,
that runs on a two rollers. What are these rollers called, and does anyone
have some, or know where to get them?
