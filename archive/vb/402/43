Subject: Re: [VB] Does 60-62 shifter have a bigger ball than 62-67?

Thanks Clara! and all!

I did eventually get the shifter in, but the base plate is wobbly. I  
need to figure out how to insert shorter bolts so that it will be  
tighter. But this is the first time I was able to shift gears in 5  
years, so I'm not picky.  So about that - this was a good weekend for  
me - and so I'm pushing the gears and it is really tight and then not  
tight... uh oh.

I get under the back and I remember that when I was 17 (like 25 years  
ago or so), I put in a standard beetle front trans mount and it put  
enough pressure on the rear coupler to cause the shift rods to  
separate. No problem, time to start pulling the mount so I can jack up  
the trans... And while I'm back there, I might as well pull the engine  
to make the trans move easier. Oh and while I'm back there, might as  
well try to get the bay window gas tank in the right way... Which  
amazingly I had time to do. Planets must have been aligned or  
something - actually my wife was taking a long nap and there was  
nobody to inspect the progress on the house projects. :-)

I need to buy a Hazet deep offset wrench for those engine and trans  
bolts though...
