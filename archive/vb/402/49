We stock this magazine:

http://busdepot.com/view.jsp?prodgroup=1149

We don't always have the latest issue, because to save shipping costs we
import the issues as part of our regular parts shipments rather than
separately. So if an issue is released between shipments, we won't see it
until our next parts order.  But if you don't mind not always getting it as
soon as it hits the newsstands, you'll save a fortune in international
postage. Postage on a single issue by itself is a bit pricy ($4 or so, since
we don't use bulk mail), but postage on several issues together costs about
the same as on one copy ... or if you add it to a parts order, it will add
virtually nothing to the shipping cost of your order.
