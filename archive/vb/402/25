Subject: Crew Cab Almost Back on the Road

I have been mostly a lurker as of late.  I'm definitely an air-cooled VW
guy, but the past few years I have been lured away by my w/c VWs.  I have
always had at least one air-cooled (currently 2), but they were sleeping.
Never out of sight. . . or mind.  I have always attended the shows, too.
Mostly hoping it would force me to get the crew cab going again.  Seeing
Chris' DD Camper helped a lot!

Short history on the crew cab.  It's a 61 that Lee Leighton (old Porsche
guy) had built to be a parts runner.  It had a 2.0 911 engine, IRS 901 'Le
Mans' 5-speed tranny, and front discs.  The brakes had been updated to 71-up
bus pattern, even the Type 3 rear drums.  I picked it up in '95, then almost
immediately wrecked it.  I had it fixed by Flash, a local body guru.  Then I
added Porsche front discs and 914 rear discs with Fuchs alloys.  The engine
had a few problems when I bought it.  Needless to say, it made it about
2,000 miles.

So it sat.  Kids, divorce, kid's cars, kid's college, you know the story.
10 years later, the virus returns!

I just bought a 2.2 911 engine that I'd spent the last 5 months haggling
over and now I'm obsessed with getting it back to daily-driver status.  I
spent last weekend tearing the upper end apart and resealing cam covers,
updating the fan shroud, and exchanging flywheels so I can run my old
clutch.  The motor will be in this weekend and then I get to play games with
the DMV (it has 2000 tags).

Can't wait for that sore neck!!
