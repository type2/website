Subject: What ever happened to the bus boat?

I headed into the library this evening with a 1986 Hot VWs. Mark  
Walters covers a Pacific Northwest  VW show, a 23 window has a cool  
bus boat mounted on top. He made a comment that someone was going to  
reproduce them. I think I've seen one since then. Has anyone seen one  
of these lately?
