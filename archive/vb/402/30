I am certain of this:

the cargo secion floor and walls, all the way to the rear hatch are
grey from the factory.
the cab secion floors (including the walk-thru part), pedistals, and
pillars are dove blue from the factory.


i am uncertain of these as they've been spray painted:
the dash... i assume it was dove blue.
the  cab section ceiling.
inner (inside) of door.... they are grey with dove blue overspray....
possibly factory.


again, this is a '63 sundial, a panel van from the factory.


furthermore, the upholstery is also a mystery to me.
the passenger seat and base of the driver seat are black
leatherette.... I am 99% sure this is factory VW upholstery, most
likely from another earlier (pre 59?) bus
looks exactly like this:

. the backrest on the driver seat is that grey mesh found on deluxe
models I think.  looks like this:

I believe this should all be grey faux leather to be correct...

it is all in really good, worn shape except for the drivers backrest
which is much more worn, torn, missing parts.... which would lead me
to think that it was older than the black... who knows...

I'm pretty sure its all going to get done over in the correct grey...
whether the black came with it or not.
