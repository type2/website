Chirco's Bug-toberfest #12 2007 Tucson 


October 21st 
Once again it's time for Bug-toberfest #12 
If you didn't make it last year, you missed over 150 cars in our parking
lot. 
If you did come to the show, you know how much fun we had. 

There will be a free pre-show BBQ the night before, so let Joe feed you.
