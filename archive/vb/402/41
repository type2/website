Subject: Bus Movie Sighting

Over the weekend, I re-watched the Alfred Hitchcock
classic, "North by Northwest" and about 5 minutes into
the movie there is a bus in the background.

While Cary Grant is in a taxi talking with his
secretary, through the back window one can see a bus
parked while they make a turn.

Since the movie was made in 1959, it's nice early bus.
