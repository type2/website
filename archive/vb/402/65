Subject: Buses By The Depot - Please RSVP Even If Not Camping

A reminder that if you are planning on attending Buses By The Depot on
Saturday October 20 (http://busdepot.com/BBD2007.htm) - even if not camping,
and just coming for the afternoon - I would appreciate an RSVP.  I need a
rough count of how many daytimers we'll have versus overnighters.   That
doesn't mean you're unwelcome if you haven't RSVP'd, but if you're almost
positive you're coming please shoot me an email. 

Also there are still some overnight camping spots available for $10.00 via
Paypal (details on the above link).  Several people who mentioned they
planned to camp have not actually reserved.  Sites may also be available on
the day itself directly from the ranger's office (unless the campground is
sold out), but they will cost more and may not be next to our sites.
