Subject: Does 60-62 shifter have a bigger ball than 62-67?

Hi,

I am finally getting back to putting my (65 bus) shifter assembly back  
together and keep running into snags - but that's nothing new for me.

I bought a 62-67 shift rod from Wolfsburg West and put it in (because  
I had to cut up the old one to get it off). I'm sure it is the later  
one because it has the hole in the front for the '67 shift rod guide  
pin. When I went to attach the shifter, the ball doesn't fit into the  
shift rod cup. Is the 60-62 shifter ball bigger than the later shifter?

Thanks,
Conrad
