Subject: Re: [VB] Suggestions for tap/die set

Thanks for all the suggestions.

I want to clean up threads, as well as create new threads for  
additional pop-outs. My Standard-Deluxe (European spec) came with only  
two pop-outs and I want to put in pop-outs all the way back. 3.5 mm x . 
6 mm pitch is right (sorry). Doesn't look like HBF has that size.  
Sears doesn't tell you what you get. So building my own looks like the  
way to go...

Are the specs for the other bolts, nuts, screws, etc. in the Without  
Guesswork?
