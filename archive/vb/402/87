Subject: Re: [VB] What ever happened to the bus boat?

Gary, I've visited a number of fiberglass shops and many of them will 
build custom molds.  You might look around your area for shops which 
build boats, race car bodies, campers and anything else made in 
fiberglass.  I'm sure if you put up the cash, someone will build you 
a mold.  I made a mold for a fiberglass canoe while in college.  It's 
not rocket science, but you do need to know a few "tricks".

I would think you could sell a few if you get someone to make the mold.
