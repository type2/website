As we  have now ethanol / lead replacement fuel ( sugarcanefuel), 


hello Mike  tell us more about this .  Do you have to make any  changes to 
the motor of fuel system to run ethanol?  My understanding is  that the manifold 
needs more heat and some rubber components will rot from the  ethanol. I 
think the jets need to be bigger also. I know that south America uses  this a lot 
but we haven't heard much about what needs to be done. Living here in  
moonshine country this might be doable. :)  later  mark dearing   Salem Virginia
