  BUS breakdowns that didn't make it.
1. 15 window deluxe, broke then small wreck on the way up
2. Harry Houck and Karl, electrical on bay window
3. Jon and Rachael, rod bearing?
4. Couple from somewhere in Texas, lost a rod
5. 4 others that I don't remember

  BUS repairs at Jerome
1. 2 engine pulls
2. 1 head tightening
3. To many fan belts, valve adjustments and ignition to count.
4. 2 clutch cables

   This was the best Jerome I have ever been to, despite the tragedy in NYC.
Our journey started at 5:30 am on Friday with our group meeting at my house
at 5 am. We all headed to the Circle K for gas, coffee etc. and met up with
Britt and the road cow. We then headed out, as I mentioned in a previous
post 35 to 45 mph with the 40 hp. As my DD and the other DD in our group
were built for high speed cruising, we made a decision to let them go ahead
and we would meet them at pre determined stops along the way. This made for
a very long trip.
   After numerous stops we made it to Jerome, 7 hours later. VW Howard had
left Havasu an hour after us and arrived at Jerome almost 2 hours ahead of
us, how did this happen? One way we discovered was he probably passed us
while we were changing my shift coupler at a gas stop. We proceeded down the
highway, but again 45 mph makes it hard to catch someone. VW Howard also
took the dirt shortcut that we also took on the way back, cuts about 50
miles and 1 1/2 hours or so off of the road trip and it's a beautiful drive,
look at Sams picture of the old erector set bridge on that road. All in all
everything went well. I have ended up with two broken buses at my house, one
of which I will fix and the other will have a new engine brought from NM to
get it back on the road.

nothing else, hope to find some photo's to post later
