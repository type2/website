Jim, this is the one Jerome you should have been at, mellow, mellow, mellow.
No rubber Johnneys, no all night drum circles, at our 11;30 pm walk about, I
would say 3/4s of the campers were sleeping and the ones awake were quiet.
No excitment, beautiful weather and an absolutley awesome group of people
and buses.
  One of the best parts was I won for BEST ORIGINAL BUS with my Modern
Cleaners logoed 1960,15 window Deluxe.


ronnie

there were ton's of pic's taken by numerous listys and others, I'm sure will
be up soon.

Stayed home for the first time in ten years. Anyone
have photos? Congrats to Phil of VTO- you dirty dog!
;-) Hope all had fun. I missed seeing all of my
buddies but have to say that I got a solid nights
sleep Saturday night. 
"Snooze, you lose" didnt seem to apply this time.
Snooze was the operative word- thank you very much. =)
