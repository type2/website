I should have realized by now that when it comes to Type 2s, never
assume anything.  So if my second dome light with speedo pod switch was
not a factory issue item (as it now appears), I'm wondering whether it
was part of some other M-code or just a dealer-installed option like the
radio?

It appears that the dealer might have loaded up my DC with extra goodies
to help get it off his lot.  Or else the first owner did a very careful
job on installing them himself.  2nd dome light, rear seat ashtray,
deluxe horn button, deluxe dashboard clock, EMPI steps--none of these
appear on the original bill of sale.

Well, live and learn.  It might be interesting to figure out what year
VW started providing the mounting holes above the DC's rear window for
this phantom dome light.
