Subject: Re: [VB] Excess oil pressure

I am currently running 40 wt. oil, and yes, the weather has cooled a little.
The problem has progressed, it started with the pressure building to around
80 psi, then it would drop suddenly (presumably when the relief popped
open). Now, it doesn't drop, it just keeps building. Driving home on
Saturday I had to keep my speed to about 55 mph (how ironic!) to keep the
pressure below 80. It is time to change to 30 wt. oil, but I don't think
that's the whole answer.

Thanks to everyone for the input.

Craig
