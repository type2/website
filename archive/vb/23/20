You may want to check your wiring connections to the coil and starter.
Replace the condensor and try another coil.  Go from there.

As for the fuel pump - I run a stock mechanical pump with a regulator after
it.  I run dual 40IDF's and cruise 65 to 70 with spurts up to 77mph if I
want.  The stock pump keeps up fine.  Gene Berg says your fine until you get
into those high end drag racing engines.  For street applications, the stock
pump rocks.
