Subject: Jerome pix and stories?

Stayed home for the first time in ten years. Anyone
have photos? Congrats to Phil of VTO- you dirty dog!
;-) Hope all had fun. I missed seeing all of my
buddies but have to say that I got a solid nights
sleep Saturday night. 
"Snooze, you lose" didnt seem to apply this time.
Snooze was the operative word- thank you very much. =)
