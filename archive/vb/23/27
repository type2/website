Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome pix and stories?

I have some pics, mainly caravan and ppl coming over mingus on Sun.  I just 
woke up and now have to go to work.  I drove straight through yest and got 
home at abt 3am.  Had a great time.  Can't figure out why they separated the 
rack and ladder though.  Will post the pics when I get a chance.  Anyone get 
any pics of the slow drags?
