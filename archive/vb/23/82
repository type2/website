Subject: jerome

okay, i'm no longer so tried that i can't think.

jon and i left monterey at about 9pm thursday.  we stopped at in-n-out (burger joint) for supper.  we drove as far as wasco (near highway 5) and slept for about 5 hours.  we continued on driving through the desert friday in the late morning.  as we approached kingman, az we spotted another split bus.  we admired it and waved as we passed then took the first off ramp to get some supplies.  jon said that he was tired and i'd have to drive the rest of the way to jerome.  "about time," i was thinking.

jon pulls into the parking lot of a little strip mall when we hear this metallic sound coming from the rear of the bus.  we pull into a parking spot and hop out.  vw brainiac that i am thinks, "that's not a good sound... wonder if we'll make it to jerome?"  jon revs the engine up a bit and as it comes back down there's a tapping kind of knock.  he freaks and i'm left to thinking that if he'd only let me drive earlier this wouldn't be happening.  my faith in a vws abilities and myself is truly amazing.

we then call a whole bunch of people (jp, roger, lou, ronnie, avis car rental) tying up both payphones for about an hour.  the result:  the bus got towed back to havasu and ronnie's house (the neighbors shook their heads but commented that at least it was a pretty bus), we spent the night with lou, liz and max "the face," next morning we rode in the back of lou's single cab to jerome (8 hours - whew!), did the jerome thing and socialized, camped on the ground with the route 66 splits group and the next morning i left with sam and roger for california while jon headed back to new mexico with jp.

jerome now has a new feeling for me and i have new feeling about the people that helped jon and me.  i think i'll enjoy future non-breakdown jeromes a lot more and i'll feel especially bad for folks who are not able to enjoy the campout and festivities because of a break-down.  i don't think jon or i were able to think clearly for all the preoccupation with how we were going to proceed with getting his bus home.

i'll also feel a great indebtedness to those who've helped us.  i cannot emphasize this enough.  i feel somewhat guilty for all the fuss and trouble we caused.  your busma deposit accounts are overflowing!

the plan (as of yesterday evening) for the shiny bus is that after busses and balloons show (to which i'll fly), jon and i will drive his blue bus to havasu, swap knocking engine with a loaner and drive the two back home to monterey.  come buses by the bridge we'll return to havasu and give the loaner engine back to its owner.  i just hope the blue bus makes it!
