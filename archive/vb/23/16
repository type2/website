Subject: Re: [VB] Need 65 Fr/Shiftrod??

I have a donor 66 with the shiftrod in apparently good condition. 
 Depends on where you live dave.  I'm in seattle (bus is actually in 
snohomish if you know where that is).

Actually, if there is anyone in this area who wants a 66 donor bus (sans 
some stuff I've already taken off of it) please let me know.  U-Haul.

Bus is a 66 panel converted to a camper (by whom I don't know -- camping 
gear is gone) then to a hippie bus.  Still has lotsa parts (like those 
camper style windows -- the ones sundial used to put in) plus stuff like 
transaxle, front beam, front heater stuff.

I've dismantled much of it already (including the front lower nose). 
 Just hate to see good parts go to a scrap yard.
