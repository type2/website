1. how old were you when you first got sucked into being a vw maniac? 
15 1/2. At twenty-six I got away from VW's for awhile. When my Son 
became interested in VW's I resurfaced as a VW nut and bought my 
dream ride, my 67 camper. My son has a 61 baja and I have a Bus. Let 
the good times roll, literally.

2.what was your first car? what was your first vw? your first bus? (if there
not all the same)    1st car: 1968 Bug,  1st bus: 1967 camper

3.how many RUNNING busses do you have? (dont list all the non-ops, this email
wiill be HUGE!)   Only one, the 67 camper.

4. do you have a favorite? which one?   Well of course, the 67 Camper.


5. stock or custom? Totally stock, if you can call a camper conversion as such.


6.would you punch an alien? Nope. Too much to learn from him. Plus 
maybe I could convert him into a Bus maniac. Wouldn't THAT be cool.
