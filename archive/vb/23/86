yes we do.

broken 
parts missing

(-at-) $500 this is not cheap and certainly not free.

in 1997 I picked up a running westy for $400 in the south bay (CA)
gave it a break job, tune up & grease job drove it Xcountry
and lived in it for 2 semesters. traded it for a mt. bike.

beat that

but then i'm a whore for splitys 
I paid ten times for my heart breaking 61 kombi what i did for the 69

now the only thing i can afford is a * really * free bay window

you don't know what you got till it's gone...

aloha
