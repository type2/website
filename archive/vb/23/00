Subject: NIP the Nostrdamus HOAX! & Back from Jerome!!

Hey all, 

   Just got back from agrueling 19+ hour return trip from Jerome! 
   The show was GREAT!  It was nice to be away from the news media blitz!  Now, it's back to the Tube and the process of resaturation of the lastest details.

LASTLY, Don't believe the Nostradamus NYC/WTC Hoax.  It's just another bit of hoo haw to get your gander...follow these links for more info.
