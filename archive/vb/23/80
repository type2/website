My 60 DD has 8 fuse screw terminal, yet my 15 window (1960) has 8 fuse push
on terminal and my early 60 Westy has 6 fuse screw terminal. Gotta love all
the changes in 1960.

metal support does have the mouning holes and the larger hole for the dome 
light, but have never had anything screwed into them (paint is still there 
and smooth).  And since you mention it, the door panels do have the pockets 
in them.  Also, wasn't '61 a split year for the "screw terminals vs the push

on terminals?

if you have original pockets you should have pointy pod, and the thinner
less 
edge reinforced dash tray.

Believe the push on/screw terminal change was for the 61 model year.  In any

case it was earlier than the pointy/roundy speedo pod.   the roundy pod is 
close to being a circle around the top  of the speedo, the pointy has just 
the very ends of the top corners rounded off.  Anyone have comparison pics 
handy?, as a picture is worth a thousand words.  FWIW the bottom edge of the

pod the cut out for the dash tray is different for the later and earlier
dash 
trays.

Can't find a clear reference to the rear light/switch for DCs in my books,

later parts list is in garage not handy, but the listing for the switch on 
the side of the pod in the 58 list does show (these would be screw term at 
that time)

211 947 511A tumbler switch-interior light quantity-x type/model 
211-238,261-274

for  241 947 511A (ivory) quantity is 1, type/model 241,244  that is the 
deluxe 

meaning that some of the (non deluxe)buses do not use them.

hm.  so early typ22s get black switches?
