 I am currently running 40 wt. oil, and yes, the weather has cooled a little.
 The problem has progressed, it started with the pressure building to around
 80 psi, then it would drop suddenly (presumably when the relief popped
 open). Now, it doesn't drop, it just keeps building. Driving home on
 Saturday I had to keep my speed to about 55 mph (how ironic!) to keep the
 pressure below 80. It is time to change to 30 wt. oil, but I don't think
 that's the whole answer.
 
 Thanks to everyone for the input.

that kind of action is normal.  However building to 80 psi is a bit high, so 
I would change to a thinner oil.   Though cause it is not now dropping, that 
seem like a pressure relief not working right, just like you said.  It should 
definately drop.
