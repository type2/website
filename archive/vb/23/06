 I have been rather enamored with the Nostrademian prophecies lately and I have come to the conclusion that it is all urban legend.  Fun to read but not much to it.  And, like the Bible, only more so, his writings are very vague and can be tranlated many ways.
For those of us who cant be in the military (I wish I was young enough as I thirst for revenge) the patriotic thing is to go on as usual, spend money in a normal fashion and buy stocks in our nation's corporations.  It was economic ruin at the hand of Ronald Reagan that brought the Soviets down and we must not engage in panic selling or spreading paranoid views by forwarding the teachings of Nostrademus.  A strong economy is every bit as important as tanks and planes to a nation at war.  If the terrorists can change our lives to the point to where we are scared to live and conduct commerce than they have already won.
VICTORY AT ALL COSTS!!!

for those that dont know the prophecies of nostradamus, he predicted that "in 
the ninth month of the new millenium the twin brothers york will fall"
spooky.
i want to thank nick, another bus head, who comforted me through all this, 
and also to all those who have comforted the thousands out there who were hit 
hard by this...whether they knew anyone who died or not. we love you all.
