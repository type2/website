I know from my trip this summer to the OCTO and Classic shows that splitty
guys in S. Cal and Arizona don't much like bay window busses and even call
them "fat chicks".  So you can't fault the bay busses for not stopping to
help a split (but it would have been the Christian thing to do).

I did get a chance to tow a split about 500 miles with my bay coming back
from Cal.  The type 4 bays have plenty of power and can pull a split
nicely, but I wouldn't do it in a 68-71, these barely have enough power to
pull themselves and would damage the engines.

It's a real shame the split and bay guys can't get together on the west
coast.  Here in the midwest and on the east coast, if we did not admit the
bays and even the vanagons and EC's, our meets and campouts would be very
small.
