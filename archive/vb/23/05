Subject: temporary shutdown

Hi List, gotta question. My DC has a dual port 1600, new everything, and
runs great MOST of the time. My question: somewhere in the span of every 100
or so miles, while cruising along smoothly, the engine will just die for a
second then resume and run great for another long while before doing it
again. Sometimes it's in town at 35 MPH and sometimes it's on the big road
at 65 MPH. When it happens, it feels like it's just "fallin' on it's face".
I don't know why, but to me it feels like and electrical thing more than a
fuel thing.
Question 2 for a friend: A friend of mine wants to put dual carbs on his
Karmann-Ghia. He wanted me to ask if he should put an electric fuel pump and
fuel regulator for best results or if the stock pump will suffice.
Thanks List,

Pete
'63 DC - Buck
