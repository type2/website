Subject: Web site space for buses?

I have to get away from NBCI/Xoom & am temporarily camping at freewbspace.com.
I hate the banners and can upgrade their site for $10 a month and get 100 
megs of space.

Do any of you webmeisters out there have suggestions for a better FTP site 
that can host webapges.
I really would not mind unobtrusive Bus list banners.
