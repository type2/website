Actually, the best set of hose clamps I have ever used I purchased from
J.C. Whitney

I have contrary thoughts on hose clamps.
I use the OEM VW hose clamps exclusively.
Why? You ask.
If you use quality Fuel Injection hoses the clamps pull down very
securely and still have about six threads left for a future tightening.
They have a shield inside that keeps them from cutting the hose.
Once your fuel lines get soft the clamps will tighten all the way down
and this is your signal to replace the hoses because they've become soft,
split on the ends or lost flexibility.
You can give the hoses a tweak turn about once a year and it's easy to
see if you don't have resistance then you're needing new fuel lines.
I'm not saying there isn't a better clamp out there but I'd never use a
clamp like the IDEAL type that can cut the hose, cut your hands and leave
hanging lengths to catch wires, dirt etc.
