Subject: front beam rebuild?

I scored what seems to be a real solid '67 front beam drum to drum. 
Got the steering box as well.

I had planned to convert the rear of my '59 single cab to big nut 
redux box transaxle. So I'm now planning on installing this '67 beam 
to the front.

Before I do this, I'd like to go through it and do any replacing or 
rebuilding needed.

What's a run down on stuff to check or to do? It's all new to me, so 
anyone who's done it please pass along suggestions from your 
experiences.

Also, can I use the '67 steering box?
