Who's seals are you using. Dave at C E makes his own glass to frame seals
that work perfect. I have not been able to make WW or WCM seals fit properly
with C E's aluminum pop out frames

All,

I have recently begun assembling my new CE popout windows, and have had a 
problem with the glass-to-frame seals cupping in the corners.  I have tried 
just about everything I can think of to alieviate this problem - applying 
seal conditioner to the frames and seals to help them slide better, pulling 
the seals tight in different directions to avoid cupping, trying to move the

seals around in the frame once assembled - and no joy (but several now 
useless seals).  Is this a common problem?  Will the cupping sort of resolve

itself as the rubber "settles" into its new home?  Is there anything I can 
do?

Thanks in advance for your help!
