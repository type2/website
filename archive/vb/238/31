Vice-Grips have a sharp corner that will break or weaken the fuel 
line.  Valves are OK, but complicated...  The Big Tool Truck will have a 
hose pinching solution, or go to Sears.com. select tools, and search for 
fuel clamp.  Their Item #00947374000 looks like it might work just 
fine...  Mine are a little OG screw thingy that presses two bars together 
on the line...shuts off flow, but doesn't destroy the hose.

Best to spend a few bucks more, and get the right tool.  You'll save money 
in the long run...
