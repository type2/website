I don't like running without the same tyres on - and over here(UK) it is
very rare to be more than 10 miles away from a tyre shop - so it wouldn't be
too far.

Don't know about in the USA, but over in Europe nowadays most cars come with
a spare that is around a 125 width on a 14 inch rim whereas the car normally
runs a 195 width tyre.  The spares come with a big sticker saying do not
drive at more than 35mph on them!  Not much use if you are on the freeway!

Thanks
Paul
