Speed - work fast.  And don't use a drop light with an exposed 
bulb.  (Don't ask - just get the fire extinguisher)  Best method is to get 
two fuel line clamps (NOT Vice-Grips) and put one on the old hose, the 
other on the new hose.  Then you swap out the hoses, only having the tank 
flowing for a few seconds.  Then reconnect everything else at leisure...

Both - most busses had a braided line from the tank fitting to a metal pipe 
sticking through the front (FIF) tin.  The metal pipe went from the front 
tin to a point right near the fuel pump, where another braided hose 
connected the pipe to the pump.

Nope.

Lotsa sparks and stuff in there, especially with old plug wires.  Heat, too 
- that'll work for starting a fire.  And the hippie with the Sawzall...

Oh yeah...I've been driving down the road when my bus started coughing and 
spitting...Jitterbugged down to where I could pull off, and open the engine 
room door to see what's up -- a fine fog of fuel everywhere from the 
fitting falling out of the carburetter...no fire, though, I must have been 
living right.

Blast it in through the vents.  and that yellow powder is corrosive - clean 
it up fast...

Busses, like cats, have nine lives, but you never know how many have 
already been used up...
