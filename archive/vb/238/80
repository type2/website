Subject: $10k of audio in a 10¢ bus

   I was watching a show on TNN last Sunday called "Trucks". Unfortunately, I 
have yet to see a singlecab or doublecab on that show (maybe I should send in 
some pictures?). "Car and Driver" did show VW's latest SUV- a joint venture 
with Porsche (one with all the goodies is close to $60k!). Anyway, 
after "Trucks" a show called "Super 2ner" came on which is mainly all about 
ricers with some gatuitous T&A thrown in. They showed a Car Audio trade show 
held in Florida (Miami?) among all the latest and greatest imports they had 
about 10 seconds of a split! Couldn't tell what year or even the model (it 
wasn't a panel). The MTV filming style made it hard to see through all the 
gyrations of the cameraman and rapid fire camera changes, plus they tended to 
focus on the audio equipment in the back and the kewl flat screen with 
playstaion/xbox/dvd on the dash. The bus was burn-your-retinas green and had 
enough amplifiers and neon lighting to make old Las Vegas look dull. 
  Strangely, I would like to see more of this car and yes, I do rubberneck at 
horrific crashes on the interstate.
