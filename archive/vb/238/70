I've had the same thing happen with the brass fitting coming out of the
fuel pump. Can't remember if it was the intake or outlet, but was lucky
that it didn't start a fire. Of course, you know right away that
something bad happened, what with the car stopping and all the smell of
gasoline.

I then got in the habit of twisting a bunch of wire around the fuel
line, like around the hose clamp, and around fuel pump, sort of as a
cheap harness so that if the tube loosened it wouldn't pop all the way
out, hopefully limiting the leak to a slow ooze or trickle that I could
smell and investigate before lots of ml's of gas had erupted on the hot
engine.  Someone suggested this wire harness to me, saying that they'd
seen this happen before on the fuel pumps.
