Subject: Re: [VB] stuck drum update

I took a '66 bug rim (the one with all of the slots around it), and bolted
(with big washers on both sides of the slots) 3 pieces of chain to a 3 arm
puller.  I unbolted the arms, and bolted on the chain.  I then took my
impact to the 3 arm puller, and POP.  It came off.  I would not suggest the
impact unless it was the last resort.  Nice and slow, and nothing should fly
around the shop putting out an eye.
