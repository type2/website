Subject: Re: [VB] oil temps

Going soley by oil temp (which is always very close to case temp as well)
to determine if you are overheating can be trouble.
-------------------- Clip ------------------------
It takes a full ten minutes for the oil temp to register the change. I
depend more on my oil pressure gauge and if I see a slight drop I know
the temp is going to show a rise soon. Duh! It is actually a good way to
monitor your oil temp. The oil temp gauge is handy on long runs
............. gives me a nize fuzzy warm feeling of security.
