You forget the convection cooling properties of the lighter magnesium alloy
versus the heavier aluminum or even steel. The denser, I should say harder,
the metal, the longer it hold heat.

Makes me go Hmmmmmm.
I just cant see why this would make that much difference.
Does it seem that the sump fins and case surface could account for that
much of the cooling?
Id really want to see some scientific methodology applied here.
