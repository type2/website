Subject: oil temps

Hi group,
I'm a newby to this list and to aircooled engines....except for the
scooters. Glad I never put a oil temp gauge on the Harleys!!!
I have 67 bus with 1776cc alum. blk,044heads, doghouse cooler, mild cam
with stock exhaust, and stock transaxle with redux gears. Have run
dinosaur and synthetic oil. Temp sensor in pressure relief valve. Temps
run 240-260 and scares me to the point of pulling over for a cool down.
I will soon add an oil cooler/wfan.
Are these temps TOO high? Should I be SKEERED!!
What temps are your buses running?
Truth
Thanks,
LJ
