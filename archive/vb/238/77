I'd like to see any metal convect heat!  Convection is transporting heat
with a material that goes from one place to another, like air or water.
Solids don't convect!

Look at what you just said. The heat transfers from one place to another, like
maybe from metal to air. Doesn't much matter as to the words, just the action.
The aluminum block stays hotter longer than the magnesium blocks. There is a
metallurgy report from VW on T-4 blocks explaining this, I will try and dig
this up.
