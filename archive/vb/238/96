If you
are talking about the metal's ability to absorb and hold heat for a given
temperature difference then you need to look at the specific heat of the
metal.  This doesn't really mean much except in terms of warm-up time.

If you're talking about the metal's ability to move heat from one place to
another, then you are talking about thermal conductivity.  The amount of
heat moved depends upon the temperature difference, the thermal
conductivity of the case, the area through which the heat moves, and the
thickness of the case.  It's not as simple as saying that "the case is
made of X material so it transfers heat best."
