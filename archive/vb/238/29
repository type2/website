Subject: Re: [VB] fuel lines _scary stuff_

I adjusted the fuel pressure coming out of the new gas pump I'd recently 
installed yesterday.  Bentley says that the fuel pressure should be 
2.8psi at 3800 rpm.  The pump was working at 3.7 psi with 3 gaskets 
installed, one against the case, two at the pump.  This is not really 
too high but I have had problems with float needle valves leaking and 
wrecking the motor oil when the fuel pressure is higher than what's 
needed.  I found two more thicker looking gaskets and when they were 
installed the fuel pressure dropped to 2.8 psi.  I doubt that 2.8 psi 
will blow the fuel line off of the pump or carb.  Still, I use screw 
clamps on all fuel line connections!  Gary Gibson
