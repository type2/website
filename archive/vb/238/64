I've always used a small vice-grip and never seen evidence of hose damage either.  I put it on where the jaws are parallel to rather than 
perpendicular to the hose (well, close to parallel as I can get).  I try to get just enough pressure to stop the flow without crunching the hose.

I put a golf tee in the end of the hose for extra insurance.

Last engine-out I used spring clamp with plastic-coated jaws.  Was not quite strong enough to shut off the flow, but it's a worn-out clamp.  Something 
like that would probably work.

I like E&B's idea of using a reserve tap - wish I'd thought of that when I had the tank out & was replacing the filter anyway.  But some of those shutoff 
valves others have posted links to look usable.
