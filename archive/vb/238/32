Subject: Re: [VB] fuel lines _scary stuff_

Thanks for the suggestion.  I have never had a broken line due to using vice grips. The key is not to wrench down too hard as it doesn't take much to stop the flow plus my fuel line never gets very brittle as I replace it once a year. I would gladly use the original clamps if I could find them. Now a pen on the other hand...I did that once. Never again!   Sean 65 Westfalia
