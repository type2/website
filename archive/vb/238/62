In meters, these are:

34/39.4=0.86m
15.5/39.4=0.39m
8/39.4=0.20m

multiply these to get cubic meters:

0.86x0.39x0.20=0.067m^3

Since a cubic meter is 1000 liters:

0.067x1000=67.1 liters

for those who don't do metric, 1 liter is 0.264 gallons:

67.1x0.264=17.7 gallons

Which is a bit more than a Bay tank.  Nice find!
