The outside dimensions are the same, but the wall thickness of the aluminum
case is greater than the factory OEM. But most of this chat is supposition, I
guess you have to own one or know someone who does to really know.

considering the aluminum casting is very similar to the original this
would pretty much put the notion that an aluminum case will cause the oil
temps to be 15-30 degrees hotter in questionable light.
