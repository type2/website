Subject: Re: [VB] fuel lines _scary stuff_

When replacing the lines the most important thing is to use hose clamps at
every connection pressure or not, cloth covered or not, use hose clamps!
Also when useing new metal lines give the end a bit of a flare as to stop
the hose from sliding off. Some will say you don't need them w/ OG type hose
but always better to be safe than sorry. Should you smell gas and the engine
has died out, DO NOT TRY TO START IT! Check for source of odor. Most fires
start when you try to restart it and fumes are high and a spark from the
starter, generator, leaking plug wire, etc. ignites the fumes which are the
most flammable and explosive state of gas and the easist to ignite. And for
those w/ fuel infection if the key is left on when a fire starts you are
pumping gas at 35 psi+ and feediing the fire till the key is turned off or
the pump or wiring burns up stopping it.
