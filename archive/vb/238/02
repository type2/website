Hi Matt,
We have no problems steering with the tires the same pressure front and rear 
on any of our buses, bugs, and even the 1963 K. Ghia over the last twenty 
years.  Also have found that our tires wear absolutely evenly without 
rotation over this time period.  This latter finding probably due to making 
sure suspensions are straight and aligned properly.
