Subject: re:fuel line stuf-off

on the topic of fuel line shut-offs, I had trouble finding anything
locally-tough to get something rated for fuel, and small. Now that I think
of it I wonder if I could have gotten something at a model/hobby shop, or
possibly the petcock valves they use on motorcycles.

anyway here are some links to shut off valves I found, I have not gotten
around to purchasing any of these...but just to let you know:
