Howdy Rob,

I replaced my fuel line completely on my '66 in one evening.  After noticing
that the fuel line coming thru the fan  shroud had rubbed a notch almost
into the center of the line, very scary indeed.  All you need is to purchase
some of the 'good' braided rubber hose, I think it's 3-4mm, and some 1/4"
bendable brake line tubing available at the FLAPS, about a 5' piece will do,
and it's cheap.  As for the fuel coming out of the nipple in the tank, I
found a 1/4" vac cap to replace my old fuel line while I was working on the
new set up.  Cut about a 4-6" piece of hose that will fit on the nipple on
the tank,the other end on your metal line. Bend your metal line so that it
will run across the top of the trans axle area, I was lucky, my Bus still
had the little metals tabs to hold the metal line in place. From here, I put
in another 6" piece of rubber hose to make a nice bend towards the engine,
where using the metal line, I can now run it straight thru the fan housing,
put a slight bend under the intake manifold, and another 6" piece of hose to
the fuel pump.  The key is avoiding areas that may rub against your rubber
hose or metal line.  I put a rubber grommet in the fan shroud and then tie
wrapped a 3" piece of the rubber fuel hose, that I had slit lengthwise
around the fuel line as it passed thru the shroud, double protection.  Also,
I saw a little rub on the fuel line right under manifold, so did the same
thing.  Solid, secure and best of all cheap.

Good luck
