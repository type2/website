Subject: [VB] re: I need to idle

 Thanks to all who resonded to my prvious idle question:
 Valves adjusted, added a dry gas to tank and drove the tank till empty . The rust isn't as bad as I orginally thought but I love the magnet plan and will employ that until I restore/replace the tank.  Now I idle nicely when the engine is warmed up.  Next step: rebuild the carb.  Thanks guys.!!
