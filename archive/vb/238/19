Subject: Reminder: O'Leno Fla. (Love Bug) Campout May 9 through 11

Just a reminder that the campout is this weekend at O'Leno State Park, right off I-75 near High Springs.  Still plenty of campsites available -- see 
reservation info link below.  Look for a site in the Dogwood Loop.

A group of us are paddling the Santa Fe River on Saturday.  Let me know ASAP if you want me to reserve a canoe/kayak for you.
