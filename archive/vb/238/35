Subject: Help TheSamba win a Webby Award!

I became aware of the Webby Awards through an online radio station that I have
fallen in love with. (Http://www.KEXP.org)

It occurred to me that my favorite "German car" site ought to be nominated and
the we ought to orchestrate a write-in campaign as a thank-you pay back to
Everett Barnes for all of the service that he has provided to the "German car"
community. Please pass the word.

I propose that we all vote within the following url:
http://www.webbyawards.com/peoplesvoice/register.html

Please vote under the "Community" category. The Samba is not a commerce site,
it is provided as a service to our community. Other sites like eBay.com,
Amazon.com
would be obvious butt-kickers if it were (commercial).

I have already voted using the following URL:
http://thesamba.com/vw

In order to give consistent credit, we need to use the same one. Vote between
now and June 5, 2003. Spread the word and see if we can make Mr. Barnes a Webby
winner!
