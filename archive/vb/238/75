You forget the convection cooling properties of the lighter magnesium
alloy versus the heavier aluminum or even steel. The denser, I should say
harder, the metal, the longer it hold heat.

Having done considerable research with aluminum beer cans I find that
Aluminum cans with cold beer transfer cold much faster than Aluninum cans
without beer.
I'm going to research Aluminum cans with hot beer on my next fishing trip
and I'll be filing a report as soon as I sober up.
