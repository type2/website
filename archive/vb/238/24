1) Is there a trick or shut off valve to use so that gas doesn't go everywhere while replacing fuel lines?
 I use vice-grips.
 2) what is the right best fuel line setup? Metal rubber or braided? I searced for post but haven' found out what is best.   I prefer the german braided fuel line. I also make it a point to change it or test it for leaks once a year.

3) Do I need to remove the engine to replace all the fuel lines?   No, but it would be easier, especially with the tank line.

4) Last but not least, what is the most typical mechanism of engine fires. The gas starts leaking on to engine and ?? ( also electrical short ?? ) . Does the gas ever start leaking and just douse the engine without starting a fire?
  I have heard that many are related to the line/filter combo breaking and gas getting on the coil or usually the distributer. Personally  I like my fuel filter before the pump because than I can use a solid piece of fuel line from the pump to the carb. That way should the filter ever fail it is not above any "hot" leads. Also, it is CRUTIAL to use hose clamps on all of the connections.  Double check the brass fittings that your fuel line attaches to at the top of the carb. Those can work loose over time as well.
