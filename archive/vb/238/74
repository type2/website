Actually, the best set of hose clamps I have ever used I purchased from J.C.
Whitney back in the late seventies, and I just looked them up and they still
carry them!

I saw a version of this in a UK-written Haynes manual.  They suggest
using Vice-Grips or "mole grips", but putting two sockets over the
jaws so the round socket sides pinch the holes.  The picture they
had showed a long-nose locking pliers, but you could probably make
this work with regular locking pliers.

When I'm replacing lines, I usually just drain the tank into a
plastic gas jug.  If I'm taking off the fuel pump or carb, I have
a stubby Phillips screwdriver with a round shank that fits the hoses
pretty well; I stick that in the hose and tighten the hose clamp a
bit to plug it up.
