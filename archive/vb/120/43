You cannot use the 68-70 masters because you cannot get a reservoir with a
screw cap to fit them. The two holes are farther apart then the 67 and 72+
masters. 68-70 is [if memory serves me] 100mm. All the others, including VW,
Mercedes, Volvo, are 85mm center-to-center.
Unless you used the upper reservoir, tube, and lower reservoir from 68
[one-year-only set-up] or 69/70.....
