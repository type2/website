Subject: Re: [VB] What is the toughest climb you ever drove?


I used to have a '55 euro westy with a 36hp engine of
unknown provenance.  I sold it to a Japanese gentleman
(after it festered on the American market for months)
who drove it to LA.  I'd asked him to call me when he
got there and tell me how the drive went.

I got a call ~10:00pm 2 nights later.  He made it Ok,
but he had this to say

"by Bakersfield, big hill, big hill - velly hard - VELLY hard, but it go!"
