Hi Volks,
That is what we figured.  Though it would be interesting to see how low of 
brake pedal one would have, our biggest reason was because VW did not do this 
in the 1972 and later bus.  Our best guess is that with a 19mm dual MC there 
is less control between braking and locking up wheels.  So VW just went with 
the more complicated and more expensive vaccum servo brake booster in 71 here 
in the USA and in 72 for Euro and many other countries.  Of course the front 
disc brakes are probably another factor in there to since they require more 
pressure than drum brakes to work properly.
