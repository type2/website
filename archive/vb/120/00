Subject: I put a '70 gas tank in the '63 Van

It sure fits in there Easy ! I tried it with the '70 filler and didin'd like
the fit so I used  Thoms  idea of 10" cut off a junk tank filler, much
better.I'll save the orginal up in the rafters( just in case). It sure is
nice pulling the engine out with the removable rear apron straight out the
back and with dual carbs too.   Lloyd in Eureka, Calif
