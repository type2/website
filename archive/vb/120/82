Subject: RE: [VB] Dual circuit upgrade

I was concerned about the braking balance too with the bay MC...  So I
figured I would install 944 discs up front to eliminate the concern :)

Hopefully in a couple weeks I will have an upgraded braking system that is
adequate for today's needs of psycho cell phone SUV Starbucks soccer mom
drivers!  Yuck!  With some digital pics as well.

... And Berg shifter from Ronnie as well.  BTW Ronnie has been VERY helpful
for bus product information and bus issue(s) talk.  Support the people who
support us, if you are not already.


Take Care,
