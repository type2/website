Hi Mark,
Try looking for a sealing puddy used on RV windows and we recently found this 
same stuff at a local Home Depot hardware store in the household door seals 
area.

We repair, clean, polish the crystal & face, repaint the inner frame and 
hands for $75.00 which includes return shipping in the USA.

That depends on what part of the planet you are on!  Best way to do it is 
yourself though!  Just buy a quality upholstery kit.

Take the engine and seat frames minus the springs and fully degreased to your 
local powder coater.  Have him sandblast them, zinc primer coat, and then 80% 
gloss semigloss black coating.
