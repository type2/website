Wouldn't a proportioning valve be required to balance the brakes
correctly with a different MC?

Tried the bug conversion and it works but makes for a real spongy pedal.
The best bet in my OPINION is to step up and buy the 67 master. CORRECT
part for a early bus. I am still not sold on putting a disc brake master
on a drum brake car. It doesn't work on dune buggys or bajas, so I still
can't figure out how it can work properly on a 4 drum brakle bus. On the
buggys it locks up the front brakes prematurely. The reason it doesn't
on the bus is probaly due to the weight, but what happens in a panic
stop on a slick road?

ronnie   just my opinion

Thanks for the info.  What about using a 19.0mm Bug MC?  Should give
increased pressure at the brake pads?
