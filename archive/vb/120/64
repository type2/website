A local auto paint supplier put a water resevoir-sized 
cordless device on my doublecab and made up two rattle 
cans of paint for me. With a can of self-etching primer 
the bill was $32. 
In an earlier post I told of the quart of enamel house 
paint matched to a radio block off at Home Despot to 
patch up a rough dove blue camper. $8 as I remember. The 
code should be in the earlier message under a search 
for "Behr". 
At this year's BYOB someone was selling rattle cans of 
interior colors. Don't know the cost.
