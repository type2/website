Subject: Re: [VB] What is the toughest climb you ever drove?

Last summer, in the 58, 3.88 smallnut with stock 1600.  Pulled four major
passes in one day.  Left Snowy Range area of Wyoming, went down through
Steamboat, Craig.  Cut south off of 70 a little east of Grand Junction CO.
on some little pissant road just for old bus travel.  I can't remember the
name of the pass, I'd never heard of it. It was the slowest pull I
remember on a paved road pass.  I continued on through Silverton, down
through Durango and went east a ways and found a place in the dark to pull
over and sleep.  That old "spare" 1600 worked real hard that day.
Obviously I wasn't slowing down for the scenery, but I had a nice drive.
Saw a nice white over blue split headed up as I was coming into Durango.
