Subject: Result of battle with Vwoa over naughty dealer.-ALSO, Suspension sound debugged.

Good news volks! Actually got VWoA to pay up over 200.00 to compensate
for the shady dealer from NY on that 99 EV we picked up. Corp aggreed VW
used certified should=inspectable and road worthy. (no sh1t!), and we
got half the money back. Better than nothing, but still short of the
mark.
Driving the 66 today, the suspension sound I previuosly mentioned was a
loose lower shock bolt.
