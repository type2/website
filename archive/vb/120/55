That would be Sherwin Summit, heading toward Bridgeport and Reno, not
Isabella.  There are four summits in the next hundred miles or so on that
road.  Conway Summit north of Lee Vining is no picnic either

We've been over several 11-12,000 foot passes in Colorado.  I don't think
that our bus has been overtaxed on any pass we've gone over.  It's amazing
what you can accomplish with gears!
