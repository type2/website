Subject: Re: [VB] What is the toughest climb you ever drove?

 
> I came up with:

120 East, Priest Grade (old or new!)

Tehachapi Mnts going to AZ 

Conway Summit 395 N of Mono Lake

Road up to Jerome!

Honorable mention is not particulary steep but lets
just say that 35 miles on a dirt barely 2 lane,
washboard road, fairly steep at dusk in Death Valley.
I took my 65 Westy (pre paint job!)with 6 people up to
the Race Track and as we were going up  Land Rover
club was comming down and the look on the faces as
they passed us was AWESOME!

65 Westfalia
