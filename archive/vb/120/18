I'd have to say my steepest climbing was going through Yellowstone in my
loaded 66 westy.
Running a 1641dp, I was still lugging second gear to go up one particular
hill!

In my rant about my bus I was trying to remember the worst, most extreme
climbs I ever drove.

I came up with:

East out of Salt Lake City, heading to Cheyenne, Wyoming.

North out of Bishop California. I think I was heading for Lake Isabella.

Reno, Nevada to Grass Valley, California.

I-5 at the Cal- Oregon border (honorable mention, not too bad)
