The '63-'67 Workshop Manual gives an unloaded length of 62-64mm for the 1500
single oil relief spring.
I also have two 71mm springs and an 80mm. The 80mm is what is available new
(Bugpack, etc.) My '68-'79 "Official Service Manual" says that 68-69 use one
spring length, 70-71 use another, and 72 and on (whatever those are...) use a
third. Lengths are only given loaded, so I will have to load and measure them to
figure out what I have.
Anyway. I bought that Wilson rebuild book, very nice, did some reading and now
have a much better understanding of the system. An overly long relief spring
would not be causing crazy high oil pressure. A sticky oil control plunger
might, but new evidence came my way today. At a red light after a long freeway
drive on a hot day, oil temp at around 190-200 (pretty accurate), engine IDLING
smoothly, my pressure gauge read 90psi. I don't think this is can be correct,
either my new VDO gauge/sender has lost its way or somebody found a way to
install the oil pump from a Caterpillar in my VW case. (Cat at one time built
1823 cubic inch, not cc, aircooled engines. Sure it is one thing to put a big
aircooled engine on an airplane, or even a bus, this engine went in a Sherman
tank.)
Thanks everybody,

(on our way to Point Reyes CA tomorrow, if you see us let me know if there's oil
spraying out the back...)
