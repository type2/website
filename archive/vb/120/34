Hi Joel,
We went through our manuals that we have out of storage and could not find 
the uncompressed length.  So pulled the one we have in our 1641SP DR CW 
engine.  2.4" (61mm) for the relief spring and 1.18" (30mm)

A bathroom scale should work.  Those aftermarket springs are a heck of a lot 
harder, making it a pain to install.  With the stock springs we do have now 
Eric can compress each one with just a thumb and forefinger without 
straining.
