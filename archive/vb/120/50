Volks,

How about ANY of those pulling out of the So Cal/LA basin?  The 
Grapevine, El Cajon, and the smaller, steeper ones?  Anyone gone up to
Mt. Wilson in a bus?  And how about the Baker Grade on I-15?  Man, that
was sooo long I had to stop and use a couple of those water jugs when I
came up here to go to school back in May of 1969 . . .  in my '66 1300
Bug!  heh,heh,heh.

Also.  Someone said "Yellowstone."  Not good enough.  There are three
or four entrances to the park.  Which one you talking about?  Which
direction were coming from?  There is a neato "Rail Trail", from Ashton
Idaho, up along Warm River and thence across the Island Park area up to
Big Springs, which is the headwaters of Henry's Fork of the Snake.  From
there it goes over the Continental Divide and down into West Yellowstone
City.  

Oh, wait, that it a mountain bike/cycle/trail machine trail.  I did it
on a mb last June.  BUT, you could do it with a bus/bug if they'd pave
it and put the rail bridges back in on the east side of the Divide.  The
NF cut them down to keep Snowmobiles out during the winter--to protect
the elk, moose, black/brown bear groups that winter there.  Wild stuff
up there.   I saw it all too.  It would be a nice do-able road, esp. for
busses, . . . heck, it is an old rail line, afterall.  But, ain't neva
gonna happen,  evva!

Best,

Curt
