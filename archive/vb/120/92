The proportioning valve adjusts the front/rear pressure ratio so that all
four wheels will lock up at pretty much the same time.  You can do without
it, but either the front or the rear will lock up first, reducing your
overall braking and control ability.  Baywindows have a porportioning
valve that adjusts with the deck angle of the bus, sending more braking to
the rear wheels when loaded.
