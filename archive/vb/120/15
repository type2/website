Subject: Re: [VB] door hinge

is the hinge attached to he door? it's not clear.  attaching lower hinges to front doors is a PITA because you want it aligned right

In anycase, I'd use penetrating oils.  Or heat and paraffin. Get it glowing - that tends to do it.  then pour cold water on it ... the shock treatment helps

'64 lower front door hinge. from drivers door. off now.
not really rusty but frozen solid.  cant do a thing with it.
Drive pin out? no way, wont budge. Drill it? Ha it must be made of
kryptonite. cant even scratch it. Ive tried pretty much everything
including extreme heat and penetrants. so.
Any ideas? Or another hinge?
thanks
