That is why I still have them. But I am soooo happy with it lowered.

When I was young, 30 years ago me and my friends shared ownership of a '60
bus and drove it for years. We changed engines like batteries. We drove that
thing all through Oregon, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Montana and all of
California.

When I decided to rebuild an old bus, a few years ago, besides the fact that
it was a rusty wreck and needed new EVERYTHING, I decided in my old age I
wanted 3 things; to lower it for stability, to have highway gears to do 70
without blowing the engine, and an engine strong enough to climb the
Continental Divide at better than walking speed (or the climb East out of
Salt Lake or North out of Bishop CA or even the road between Reno and Grass
Valley).

I have all those things and I cannot, repeat, CANNOT be happier. This bus is
my shop truck, daily driver, and, besides my wife, is the love of my life.

I know the purists' brains want to explode at these blasphemies, but I
repeat HAPPY!

Now the '68 Karmann Ghia Autostick I think will be kept bonestock. She
doesn't need much repair and I will keep her as she is.
