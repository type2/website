It's always so upseting when you meet up to help someone out just to find 
that their ve is dead.  Last year me and my brother took the 67 poptop westy 
out to San Diego for a week.  Ran good with lots of power in the 1776 sp, 
especially compared to my little 1600.  Can't image what it would be like in 
the 36hp.  Anyway, on the way home crossing the desert just outside of el 
centro at 2:00 am I see the dim glimmer of taillights on the side of the 
road.  Cruising at 60 I didnt have time to slow down and pull behind them.  
So I brake, pull off to the shoulder, make a U-turn and drive back (wrong way 
on the highway) to check it out.  Turns out to be a recently "fully restored" 
1956 oval.  Pretty nice, accessorized and all.  A mexican guy gets out.  
Stinky! must have been there awhile I guess.  Anyway he starts telling me 
that he was drivin along then all of a sudden it just died and threw smoke.  
I checked it out and there was oil everywhere.  Wouldnt fire.  We tried for a 
loooooong tme to get it going with no luck.

I felt so bad that I couldnt help get him on his way back to mexico, but I 
did manage to get the highway patrol to pull over and help him.

Sorry, im really bored and had to write something.
