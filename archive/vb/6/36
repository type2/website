Alas, the SoCal nickname for baywindow buses is
Fatchick buses. The inference is that cool folks know
enough to buy splitties and wannabe clueless fat girls
fall into bay windows. The buses are supposedly able
to "fit" them better with the slightly wider girth and
the softer ride.
To me, the supposed fatchick buses at the moment might
be a better value, nicer ride, less proned to
hyper-inflation and megalomaniac "valuation".
<unfortunately, not by much anymore> 
If anyone has a mint '68-'71 Westy needing nothing but
a tune-up and driving and are so sick of it that they
are wanting to get it out of their garage for
free/cheap then call me immediately. I'll be happy to
be "stupid" and buy it for nothing. Maybe grampa just
died and you and grandma are clueless and just want
the memories and gramps' flawless showroom perfect
25,000 mile rustfree OG-TDB (T-D Bueno) pride and joy
to go away. <make it stop!> I will fly anywhere and
drive it home. Hardtop or poptop. I'm that nice of a
guy. Whatever I can do to help in a crisis...
