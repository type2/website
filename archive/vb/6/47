Hey Eric,

I don't know where you're at, but in GA (and probably others) you just get a 
bill of sale if the vehicle is over 10yrs old.  The PO of my bus just gave 
me a piece of paper stating he was selling it and for what amount and dated 
and we both signed it.  Being from IN I was totally sketched but titled the 
bus in SC w/ no probs.  Check all the states near you.  SC didn't even look 
at my bus at all!

Good Luck!

Eric
