Ellis sez:
It was all understood and written in an attempt of
what some folks call ~tongue in cheek~ humor. <as in
Joke/attempted sly humor>. It only appears that I'm
racist, anti-Semite and non-observant of over used
cliche' graphics affixed to and used to cheapen the
appearance of over priced vehicles. I am not
anti-Semitic by any means. 
Living in Arizona I am keenly aware of what "La Migra"
is. They are the folks who blocked my residential
street for two hours with two 40 foot tourist-like
buses with a police car in front and in back of the
buses. The street was blocked while 120 "immigrant"
law breakers used up my tax dollars while being
removed from one small residential home and prevented
me from driving my VW bus to my destination. I thank
them for dragging down my property value. This
incident has been repeated 360,000 times in Arizona so
far this year alone.
BTW: I did wave at them as I was finally able to drive
by. I got curious and similar waves back at me.
