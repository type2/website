Subject: Re: [VB] Stretchy belt...?

Hi  Since driving a 67 deluxe in 67(friends )and the 69 Westfalia(parents)
in 69 this is the first bus I've had/driven  with a bigger engine than
stock, and I laugh every time I pull away from a stop sign :) some day I'll
go back to the 1600/1500/1200, but I'm having too much fun with this... and
I will double check the pulley alignment  thanks  Lloyd in Eureka. Calif
