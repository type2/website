Hi John,
From what we understand GL-5 has a high phosphor content.  Unfortunitly VW 
used inexpensive brass (copper and zinc alloy) instead of bronze (copper and 
tin alloy) syncros.  Phosphor attacks the zinc in brass due to galvanic 
corrosion which makes it pitted and brittle.  Thusly VW recommended GL-4 for 
the standard tranny and GL-5 for the auto-stick in the early 60s.   Eric&Barb
