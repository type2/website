Is your plan for more welder to cut down on the warping???

Just thought I'd ask since the two comments don't line up on the same track.
If you can warp it with the 100, you'll REALLY be able to warp it with the
125.

For sheet metal, that Lincoln SP100 should work real nice for you.

I have used my Lincoln SP125 for lots of sheet metal welding, but have it
turned down to a real low power setting.  (Well below the SP100's max
setting).

I'll stop there and save any warping prevention discussion for later.

'60 DC with just a bit of weld here and there.  Kinda like cosmetic surgery on
a starlet
