Last night I got a call from Lloyd Elliot and his son.  They
were on their way back to Bezerkley in the son's '71 Dormobile,
when they started hearing a strange noise.  

I went out there, and found them easily enough, but had to peform a
daring "wrong way on the off-ramp"  manuever to get to them.  I had 
him fire it up, but unfortunately, he didn't need a mechanic at this 
point - he needed a priest.  This poor thing has a serious rod knock 
which sounds like it's going to go any second.  There wasn't anything
I coudl do, but I did hang out for a while and check out the bus, which
is probably the only bay I would have ever considered owning.

I haven't heard back from them, but AAA was going to be giving them a 
ride home.
