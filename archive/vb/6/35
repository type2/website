yes, it is hot.  gas expands.   I find it more economical (and better milage) 
to get gas in the am when it is colder, than later in the day when it is 
hotter- yes even underground the gas expands in the station storage tanks!   
After filling it to the first click in the winter I can just drive 5-10 miles 
and the gas does not expand out of the tank.  Now in the summer I need to 
drive further- as the gas in the tank expands MORE as it is hotter outside.   
So plan your fill ups so you drive at least 20 miles right afterwards, maybe 
30.
