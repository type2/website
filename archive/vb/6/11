Oh and then theres Clara's 'mystery' color she used, which was a damn 'close
>match'. But for some reason she wouldnt release the information to us.

She's working on it, and will post the info when it is available.
The color name, "Chameleon" is meaningless without the
manufacturer's name and the actual inventory #. And Clara
made the match to the current faded color, not the original.
