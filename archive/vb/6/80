Well, there will always be a few deaders, but the victories make up for
it.  You just do what you can, even if it just a cold drink and a phone
call.

On my way up 395 a couple of months ago, I stopped to help a guy in a
'vert KG.  Obviously overheated and had no compression.  Managed to give
myself a nasty burn on my hand by turning it over by the generator pulley.
No obvious cause for the overheat, but the general condition of the engine
bay showed a lot of Mickey Mouse repairs.

Well, after a half hour wait we managed to get the poor thing running
(sort of) and
I followed the guy to a rest-stop a couple of miles up the road.  My
suggestion was to wait for the day to cool off and nurse it another 50
miles or so up the road to Bishop, which has a VW garage.  At that point,
I couldn't do much more so I hit the road.  I got the fellow to
civilization, gave him my best advice, and he was better off than when I
found him.  That's what AIRS is about.
