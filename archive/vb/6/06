"La Migra" is the INS, those guys in the light green
Vans who pick up illegals and give them a free pass
back to Mexico.

In the SF Bay Area there are four pissing Calvin
stickers that are hip:

Calvin pissing on the word FORD.
Calvin pissing on the word CHEVY.
Calvin pissing on the 49er logo.
Calvin pissing on the Raider logo.

Maybe is time for a sticker of Calvin pissing on Calvin.
