It idles perfectly, especially when I advance the timing to about 8 or 9
BTDC

At least from the outside, the compartment is fairly clean, carb looks
new.  He has two filters on, and nothing in there.  From that, dirty
carb, float, jets, I think I would look into last, though he still has an
oil bath on and I forgot to ask when he last changed the oil.

Didn't check the pump cover.  

Anyone else?  :-)

Thanks in advance.
