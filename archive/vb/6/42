yes, don't put work/ money into it until you have the paperwork.
I bought a bus from a guy who lost the title, but as he was owner of record 
it was okay.  SOunds you have no papertrail.  THe guy has to get you the 
papers, for it to be yours.  In wa state you can get an abandoned vehicle 
title, which involves a state inspection, and a small fee, and you get a 
'temporary' title for three years, in which the 'real' owner can come reclaim 
the vehicle, though has to pay for repairs etc (if you have receipts) after 
three years it is yours cleeear.  But I don't know the rules for your state, 
and I heard the WA rules were changing.
