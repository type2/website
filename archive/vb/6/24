Subject: Re: My new 65 Deluxe!

    I have a question for those who have fought with the DMV to get a Title
change when the owner can't find one or it was in the original owners name
then he bought it without putting it in his name and then it sat for 13
years. When I ask the DMV to whom it belongs they say that the name that I
gave them (the seller) is not on the Title. The owner doesn't appear to be
all there but his room mates that live with him say he has had this bus for
a long time but doesn't have the money to fix it up. What can I do he
basically gave me the bus and told me that when he gets the pink slip out of
his storage when he finds it I can give him the money. I would really like
to get started on it but I don't want to do that until it is in my name.
