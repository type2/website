possibly something between the piston and head.   You could try pulling the 
plugs and rummaging around, or just pull the heads off

funny thing is the other day I pulled apart a motor with the same symptom- an 
H case 1500.  That somehow I ended up with after and frioend had it 'seize' 
on her.   The reason is this case was severely excessive carbon- the pistons 
could not move all the way towards the head.  guess too rich is a problem, huh
