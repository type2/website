Subject: Re: [VB] Stretchy belt...?

Hi      I've got 2 1776 engines one stretches and rotates belts, I've gone
through 3 in 2500 miles, the other does not,same belts, adjusted the same. I
don't go over 5500 rpm in either engine, and usually way below that, 4th
gear cruising isn't the highest rpm for me  it's shifting up through the
gears... The engine that stretches belts revs up so much quicker, I think it
must be the speed it changes RPM (lightened fly wheel and in the Beetle).  I
was browsing through Air cooled nets web site and He has a belt to use to
combat this. I'm going to get one of those and see what happens... Lloyd in
