Subject: T4 motor into a Type I

This is a question that rightly belongs on RAMVA, or the T2 list, but I
don't do newsgroups and the listmeisters on T2 would moderate me yet
again if I posted it there...

Here's the scoop:

I have a '68 bug that's a prime Baja candidate.  Selling the deck lids
and the fenders will net enough to buy the plastic.  It has a blown
1500. (broken cam)  I'm acquiring an untitled '74 lagwagen.  Great
motor.  What's involved in putting the T4 motor in a Baja?

Jim
