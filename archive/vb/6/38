correction- matched colour to un faded paint that was under a later coat that 
I chipped off.  Also polished up some paint on a rim that had not been 
painted over- the faded color was much lighter than what came out from 
polishing.

However, also have a rim with what looks like original paint that is a much 
more bluish white- though many more have the off white that matches what I 
got put on the westy's rims.
