Subject: SP head difference

Need some part experts help.  

Recently got a good deal on some nice rebuilt SP heads for the truck's
rebuild.  One is a 113 101 373B (per the Wilson book its a '66 1300cc SP
head) and the other is a 311 101 373A (a '67 1500/1600cc SP head).

Both heads have been rebuilt with 35.5mm intake X 32mm exhaust (sodium
filled) valves with new springs etc. The only difference is the area
around the combustion chambers.  The 113 head has a raised casting
surrounding both chambers and extends out to the head stud holes.  The
311 head on the other hand has 3 1/2 circle raised bosses around each
cylinder. Check out the lower right picture on page 48 in the Tom Wilson
book "How to bebuild your Volkswagen air cooled engine". I have one of
each just like in the picture with the exception that the valves are
matched.

Will this difference affect anything?  I have yet to CC the chamber
volumes to see if there is any difference (which I don't think there
will be).  Will the cyl's mate differently?  Should I trade for a
matched set??  

Thanks.

Steve
