Subject: Papa Hemingway and Jerry Seinfeld..?

 Hi Harry and Liz and Da'List           
 Yep....Harry it is a VW Bus Meca around here.And
maybe the shrine we return to is Morro Rock?And there
mine sits in the driveway....Darn... Sorry I missed
you two!A lady friend of mine had her parents up for
the weekend so I had to play nice.They are nice people
and even better than that her parents(just now 80)
have a friend in Morro Bay.A wonderful man(80's) and
his wife.She is very nice and looks like a model. That
have a 21 window 66 Deluxe, blue and white with the
sunroof...(Oh,we sold the 23)tucked into a
barn.OH....Yes!! I had to go l(-at-)(-at-)K!!! I got some
pictures but just on regular old fashion one time use
camera.The 66 is mostly stock but Jerry and Ellan have
done their unique building style on the inside of the
bus for a one off camper that got plenty of use.With a
place for the family dog at the back window.Their son
or was it a friend of the son? ( are you here?)
restores and sells splittys to the stars.Jerry
Seinfeld has one ..among others.Julia Roberts is
waiting for her's.I guess everyone has the
bug...Ah,Bus fever.  It was a visit not to be
missed.The man we payed the visit to very much so
could pass for Papa Hemingway in look's... stories
told and a life lived to max.                Next time
Harry....But I am no Papa Hemingway that's for sure.(I
hear you laughing George and Jim)But I have been
nearly around the world if that counts.

Mark and his under-repair...by me...poor thing..67 Deluxe walk thru 13 window Ol'No Name in San Luis Obispo,Calif...7 miles to the ocean! Sea-Ya (:}
