I'll second that.   I have had to clean and regrease a number of wiper 
motors.  It magically makes a motor work, that previously just made an 
unhappy noise.  Doing the pivot points is also very good.   On the 65-67 
wiper assemblies you should also make sure the plastic bushings in the 
assembly are good (holes are circular, not oval) to keep the wiper motion 
from being sloppy.
