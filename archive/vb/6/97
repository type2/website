Subject: Re: [T2] So I done did it. I bought a welder.


Oooh.

Did I mention.

Boy....that once-mostly-flat sheet is REALLY WARPED now. :)

And maybe, I dunno yet, but maybe, I'll take this thing back yet and get
that miller 125 I drolled over a few years ago. (I used it helping dad
build a steel framed set for a show 5ish years ago..)

Last time i priced it at the local weldinghaus it was about 525...so only
a hundred more.....Plus I can get miller parts local...lowes where I got
this doesnt sell any /parts/ (for the lincoln)...and if i recall homedepot
does but I have to drive waaay into savannah to get to one of those...and
even still the selection is limited.

None of the area welding supply houses sell lincoln parts (at least not 2
years ago when i called..)

so....maybe. I dunno.  I'll go look at the 125 again (i think thats the
model...the sp100 equivilent...slightly "more" welder, actually..) when i
get the bottle.  Maybe I'll get it maybe I wont.

Anywho.

Oh. And definitly going to invest in or make a nice apron or something I
think....ack. And at least a flipdown mask...though the hand held thing
isnt THAT bad as long as you dont have to use the other hand...it keeps it
occupied, out of the way, and you dont have to back up/move forward so you
have room to flip the thing down, either...eh. no. i cant really justify
the expensise of an autodarking mask...maybe easterwood will loan me his
for a spell and it will convince me...~grin~


It'll be a while before I have the guts to do any sort of welding on the
66...maybe I'll patch some floor in the 80 rabbit truck here, and then fix
the A pillar on my 79 rabbit...maybe the wee spot at the lower corner of
the quarter window on my brothers scirocco...

But I want to actually know wtf i'm doing before I try to do the bus! :)

First project, though, I'm gonna drop the rear section of exhaust pipe ont
he quantum and fix the split in the pipe that leads into the muffler!!!
(the pipe rusted and split length-ways at the seam..)

babble.

:)

...david
