Subject: Gas or vapor expanding in fuel tank?

Hello list,
  I've searched the archives but found no fix to my problem.  Strangely,
SINCE replacing my fuel tank sender, I've found that when I fill up my
tank until the pump nozzle shuts off automatically at the station, 10
minutes later, my tank is overflowing with gas at even the SLIGHTEST
incline.  Sometimes without an incline!  I cant figure out why changing
the sender (from a non-cylindrical to a non-cylindrical) would change
things in my tank so that this will happen?  Does this happen to many
busses?  If so, what is a good remedy?  I cant believe VW let this go on
as a problem in the first place?
  ANY input would help me much.
  Thanks,  J.D.
