Subject: Re: [VB] leaky tranny

ya- the seam forward of the forward drain plug would be case to nose cone 
seam.  If it leaks from there it is a real pain to seal up- you have to pulll 
the trannny.

Is it dropping serious pudddles?   I would bring your 17mmm alllen 
wrench/socket coverallls and GL-4 and the oil pump with you on the trip, and 
check it every so often (day?) to top it up if necccesssary.   Trannnies are 
very sturdy but they do not forgive gettting low on oil- the main bearings 
give up.   But if it is a smalll drip you can do it.

To drain/filll the RGBoxes, I take the rear wheeels off.

Probably Mr. Lube put GL-5 in because that is what they carrried.
