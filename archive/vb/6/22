Subject: Re: [VB] leaky tranny

Hi Diana,
It sounds like you possibly have over filled and/or have your bus parked with 
the nose downhill.  The nose cone of the tranny has a about a 1/8" (3mm) 
breather hole in its top/upper suface and the hockey stick area never totally 
seals which can allow some oil to leak out.
  Get out those RGB plugs!  Mixing differant makes or even differant wieghts 
of the same manufacture is not a good idea unless you are a petrochemical 
specialist!  Using GL-5 tranny oil apparently is not good for your syncros!  
If the GL-5 tranny oil installed by Mr. Lube has a much higher wieght than 
the GL-4 85/90 or straight 90 Wt it will cause the tranny parts to wear 
especially in your colder climate.
