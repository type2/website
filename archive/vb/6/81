Subject: Re: Gas or Vapor Expanding in Fuel Tank

Thank you for your replies.  Does this mean that this happens to
everyone that has split bus?  Is'nt there anything else I can do?  I
live in Hawaii, and even mornings do not ever get that cool.  You'd
think the vent on the fuel filler cap would let enough gas escape?  Did
VW ever address this in any of their manuals?  Hmmmm..   --J.D.
