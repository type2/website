You have to be from Phoenix to truly understand what
Jim says is the absolute truth –The day Ellis stops
writing to this group, is the day I sell my splitty.

Oooooh! what kind of bus and how much? Is that an
invite or incentive to quit writing? ;-) I would not
suggest placing yourself in that situation. I might
loose the cable connection and actually use the
computer for something other than fast email. Absolute
truth? Perhaps and thanks for the props but something
tells me that I'm actually overall full of s***. I
have plenty of busfriends and a spouse who would give
an Amen to that. Let's call it at least a slight
exaggeration on occassion. Blame it on the heat.
