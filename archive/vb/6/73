While sanding down and blasting my 66 21 window (white/blue) it has blue 
under the white.  Hmm. Interesting.

They didnt switch the painting process with the light on top scheme.  In fact 
I see a bazillion busses with the lower color bleeding thru on top.

Who knows, maybe Hans liked red one day more than white and vice versa.
