today I was sitting in the shade outside the cafe for an hour this afternoon, 
doing the crossword and drinking coffee.  My bus was tilted towards the gas 
cap side.  It did smell of gas when I got in.   (no gas guage sender- it's a 
61)  (vented cap)  Thought of this thread and checked my notes- it had been 
43 miles since I filled it up.   It's just a heat thing.  Does not do this in 
the cool weather.
