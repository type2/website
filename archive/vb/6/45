Subject:  Acid dipping wire to clean?

Greetings All,

Just about to start rewiring my deluxe 
project.

I seem to remember reading somewhere that
stripped wire and electrical connections
could be 'acid dipped' to completely 
clean all the verdigras and crud off 
before soldering or connecting.....

Anyone know what sort of acid and in 
what concentration?
