Subject: Oregon Scouting (we're back)

Hi All!

We just got back fom our Oregon trip (well, 4 hours ago), and we're a little
befuddled with the miles.  Everything went well, but we didn't find any
property we liked, and I like to pump my own gas get yer hands off my bus!,
among other things, but the people seemed cool, and the roads are great!
(the roads in Sonoma County really suck)

I had a problem with underheating my engine (barely over 210, hauling butt
over those hills going north from Grant's Pass in the sun...180 and lower
the rest of the time).  I'll be installing that oil thermostat I've got into
the line between the filter and the cooler ASAP!

I loved the 1776! (the mileage sucks, but I think I know why... avg. 17.814
mpg.)  Power was fun....

Only saw three split busses (on the road) the whole time!  Really big waves
from and to all....Vanagon people (even aircooled), several bays, and most
bug people don't wave.

If it's an aircooled VW, I wave!

More trip report stuff to come later (prolly a link to a webpage for those
who are interested)

After 1438 miles in three days, I think we need to sleep!

Gene
