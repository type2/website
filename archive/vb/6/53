If you did a "little" research, you'd see that Lenny who is selling it has done
MORE than his share of restoring aircooleds and keeping them on the road.
Besides, most museums just don't take everything that is donated to them and
then much of the stuff sits in their warehouses gathering dust.  And finally, if
you are concerned about it, you could bid on it too. :-))
