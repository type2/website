Howdy Y'all,
I got my first A.IR.S. call today.  Guy named Ira Bernstein who is travelling from Houston, Texas to Brooklyn New York with his daughter Shelly calls me from Cincinnati and he is having trouble with his 74 Beetle.  (He called home and had his wife search the internet for local help, and she found the A.I.R.S. List on type2.com and gave him my number.)  Anyway, Ira's Beetle is cutting out and running rough and losing power.  So I persuade him to try to stagger to my place, which he does.  I discover 1)His fuel filter is Black from dirt, clogged up big time. He said he had the car for 11 years and had never changed it! While changing the filter, his fuel lines literally crumbled in my fingers.  So we set him up with a new hose. and 2) The idle jet cutoff on his carb has vibrated loose.  We got everything in order and he tried it out and said it felt fine.  Anyway, the two are travelling up I-71 to Cleveland tonight, then straight across Pennsylvania on I-80 tomorrow into Jersey !
!
and then home in New York.  We printed off the list of all the AIRS members along the way, so if you get a call from these guys, please try to help them out, they are very nice folks. 



Peace, John Baker
