I'm sure someone will answer your question directly, but you might try
looking in the archive...if its working.  This topic comes up about

Thanks for the suggestion.  I usually hit the archives first, but at the

or something.

You're right about stuff coming up over and over.  There are only so many
things you can talk about, then you have to start over.  Ha ha.
