I  pulled a bus 20 miles to town once, he had a burnt piston......
told him if he  had no other way to buy a case of oil and check it every 10 
miles.....
I saw him later in the day 100 miles down the road and still running......but 
smoky !!!!!!

Another time in Texas stopped for a bug that was dead.....got out the towbar 
and hauled him 30 miles to town.......

you do what you can , when you can.........

but also some people should not be driving VWs, they mis-treat them and 
wonder why they break !
