Subject: Re: [VB] First time non-greeting from ACVW

when I first got a bus, I was pleased and surprised to find other bus drivers 
waving.  How cool.   Occasionally people in non-buses- usually it's kids in 
the back of a station wagon.

When I got that 59 SC, I found all sort of people waved at me - ALL THE TIME, 
including loads of people in non VWs.   Actually more non VWs than VWs.  It 
was a fairly straight (except the gates being bowed out) workaday functional, 
grey with a dark grey stripe non shiny truck.  Driving 53 on the freeway.  
People on the freeway seriously loved that truck, they would wave and smile 
at me, or slow down as they passed to take a look.   No one honked or flipped 
the bird or scowled.   When I dumped the old fridge at the fridge recycling 
place they guys unloading it complimented the fold down sides.  When I got 
plywood, the guy loading it said he had one where the sides gates were split 
into two, so there was a rear and forward side gate.  Before I got it home- a 
guy ran across the street into the gas station in Oregon where I was filling 
it up and offered to buy it.   etc etc etc.  Much more than people comment on 
the old bus.   Do people with trucks get this sort of attention normally?
