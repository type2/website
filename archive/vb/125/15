Become a teacher!  While the supposed "3-month vacation" is a myth (I
actually get 9 weeks) there is enough time to do a few thousand miles of
bus tripping.  After 10 months of molding young minds, you _need_ the
change of pace!  :)

In my case, it's called a "savings account".  If you spend a little less
than you make each month and put the remaider in the savings account you
will have the bucks for the trip.  Kind of like internal energy in a heat
engine!
