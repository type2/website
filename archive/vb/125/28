Subject: Address for OCTO/Classic?

  Anyone have a mapquest searchable address for OCTO and 
the Classic? To stay married I need to find a hotel 
nearby.
  Last year we arrived at the Christmast tree island 
campout so late we only got 3 hours sleep in the DC. The 
new air matress had a hole in it and the wife was 6 
months pregnant at the time- OOps!.

Thanks!
