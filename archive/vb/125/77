Subject: sub hatch westy question

List
Well I was at the Kite festival this weekend (another one of my addictions)
and drove the 61 westy instead of the 23 window. being such nice weather and
wanting to open the roof I was wondering if it is safe to drive with the
sub-hatch open? It sure would be nice to.
Thanks
