Subject: Blue Book fro Busses?

Hi all -
I am considering putting my '67 21-window up for sale & I remembered a
thread a long while back about either Kelly or another guidebook including
updated pricing on vintage busses.
My searches on type2.com archives aren't coming up with much - can anyone
help w/ a link?
Thanks!
Melissa
