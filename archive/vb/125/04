Subject: Parts?

Hello-

I am looking for some parts, some for a bus some for a
bar,(I'll post pics when it's done!)
I need the bottom crews for the front splash pan,
ashtray, broken switches (light, wiper, 64-65
emergency switch and light), and a emblem. Must be
cheap, and I don't care about the paint quality
either. 

Please let me know what you have!

Sean
65 Westfalia
