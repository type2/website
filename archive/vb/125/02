Subject: Shipping companies

Dear List.
I visited in Norway a few weeks ago, and found a small (4'x6'x3') fold
down travel trailer that I would like to bring over here.
Having never done this before, does anyone have the names of good
shipping companies....and the procedure that one needs to go through.  I
would be shipping it to Battle Creek, Mi.(free trade zone).
Thanks a lot....
Susan
PS. I also have a 1966 13 window deluxe parts bus for sale for $500.00.
Includes the full-width middle seat (upholstered in non-original fabric,
but in excellant condition) non-deluxe rear seat, both front walk-thru
seats, some panels, jail bars, all deluxe moldings including lower ones.
One front window missing.....kind of a rusty old gal....pick up only at
my place (southwestern Michigan)  no title..
