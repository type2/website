Subject: RE: [VB] Address for OCTO/Classic?

OCTO will be at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, which is off the 57 Fwy
at E. Katella. The Classic is at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, which is
off the 405 at Irvine Blvd.

Hope that helps... ~Rich

<<<Said Todd>>>>

  Anyone have a mapquest searchable address for OCTO and
the Classic? To stay married I need to find a hotel
nearby.
  Last year we arrived at the Christmast tree island
campout so late we only got 3 hours sleep in the DC. The
new air matress had a hole in it and the wife was 6
months pregnant at the time- OOps!.

Thanks!
