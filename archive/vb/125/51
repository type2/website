Subject: Engine test start update-Matt R. you were right

Allright! Thanks for all the help regarding my test-starting of the 1600 in my 66 Kombi. Matt Roberds, you win the prize! You were exactly right about the tranny ground strap. I ran a ground from the transmission ground stud to the battery ground and the engine fired right up! I'm proud to say that the Kombi moved today under its own power for the first time since the 1980's. Sounds and feels like a strong engine, so I am going to pull it back out and do all the stuff to do it that it needs, stuff which I didn't want to waste my time with unless I KNEW the engine was good, and it is , so..the first thing is to get rid of all that chrome engine tin! 
So, anyone wanna trade your bug for a 66 Kombi with a KNOWN good 1600 DP?!?!
