 The FIRST thing you need to do is VERIFY that the mark is TDC.
If the pulley came off a AH bug engine it MAY be 5 after.
Never assume anything.......
And I believe your 67 came stock with a 1500....

> Set my timing statically at 0 degrees TDC, as per everything I read.  Engine
idled roughly.  I tried it at 7.5 degrees BTDC, (which I had to guess at since
my pulley only has one mark on it).  Seemed to run smoother then.  My dizzy is
a 205T.
> Then I tried setting the idle mixture on my carb.  This seems to be a
guessing game, with no way that I can figure out to tell if it has been done
right.  Turned the volume screw out 2 1/2 turns, turned it in until it slowed,
out until it reached it's fastest speed, and then re-adjusted my idle.
> I find that my engine idles smoothly, quietly and I've lost the hesitation
that I experienced with my 009.  However, I seem to be lacking mid-range
power.  Also, I get the smell of the engine when I come to a stop.  The engine
seems to be running hot, although again, thats based on my senses, not on any
measurment.
> I'm concerned about the timing recommendation of 0 degrees TDC and my engine
running crappy when I set it at 0 degrees.  I'm concerned that I am slowly
burning up my engine.  It doesn't ping, smoke or anything like that.
