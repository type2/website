Subject: tires with brms on a 67 bus

Hi All,

I have this friend with a 67 bus that wants to put a set of brms on it...
we tried a 165R15 but it appears that the tire will rub on the wheel well.
I searched the archives and it seems a few people have asked the same
question but I couldn't find any replies.   The selection of tires in my
town sucks.


Thoughts?


David
