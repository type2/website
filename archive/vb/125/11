An HO618720 would be for a late April or May '67 bus.

Got stuff asked:

Hello,

I was wondering if anyone could help me out with an engine code. I have a
1963 single cab with the engine code # H0618720 When I looked in the library
it looked like it was a 65 to 67 1500. I was wondering if anyone knows what
code was used for the 1500 option that was available in 1963???? I am only
the third owner of the truck and the previous owner thought it had the
original engine.
