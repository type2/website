Subject: OCTO listee meeting - Post OCTO meet

How about 10:00 at Ronnie's and if there's a 10:00 
raffle, and hour later at 11:00? 

For the third or fourth year all listees are invited to 
hoist one on me at the brew-pub across the street from 
the meet. We'll start right after the end of the OCTO 
meet, look for my bright orange/yellow doublecab. Or if 
I don't finish the transaxle transplant this week, any 
splitty in the parking lot on Katella directly south of 
the OCTO entrance. 
You'll miss most of the toy show, but we have a good 
time. Here's the details...
