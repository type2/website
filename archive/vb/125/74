Steve,

You are correct.  I should have been a little more
clear there.  My goal is not to do a show type paint
job.  I will either use a good Epoxy Primer or some
cheaper paint.  The goal is to keep the rust out but
not to have a bus that i do not mind using to carry
stuff around.  The bus will be parked in a garage so
the only water it should see is an occasional washing
and any unplanned use in the rain.

95% complete.  Well, now that you bring it up, maybe
not all the metal is that complete.  I was more
talking about the rest of the parts for the bus.

Thanks again for the input.
Matthew
