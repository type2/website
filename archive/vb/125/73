Steve,

thanks for the input.  I do have a welder and do know
how to use it.  It is a MIG but i also have access to
a TIG at work.

What i mean by weeping is that the solution used to
elliminate the rust inside the gates would leak out of
the seams slowly.  Even after a year, i still had some
fluid comming out of the hing area of all 3 gates.  I
am hoping to find another way to get the rust out of
there.

Thanks for your help.
