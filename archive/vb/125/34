Hi Tony,
One of those paper gaskets goes between the axle or on the 1955-67 bus the 
RGB and the inside of the brake backing plate and the other goes between the 
outside of the brake backing plate and the outer bearing cover.  Make sure to 
align the outer gasket to the drain hole in the bearing cover and install 
them downward.  Also make sure to clean out the drain hole in the outer drain 
cover or risk having gear oil all over the rear brakes.
