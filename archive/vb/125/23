I totally agree with that "savings" stuff.  I have
also worked a second job on and off for a long time. 
I always find it easier to spend "side" money than the
stuff from the real job.

Another great job for taking off a massive amount of
time is firefighter (like me).  Most of us work 24
hour shifts with 48 hours off between, and
occasionally have a Kelly Day (additional day off)
that gives us 5 days off in a row.  Additionally, most
places let you trade shifts with guys on the other
shifts, so you can combine them up for some massive
time off.  

In 1992, I took 7 weeks off work (of course with pay)
and went to Kauai, Hawaii.  Making it even better was
I had a friend living there, so free room.  Yeah, I
worked a lot of extra shifts the year before, but you
gotta do what ya gotta do.
