Subject: Another One Lives


My son is no longer on this list but I did want to post that he has recently 
returned from a trip in his 63 Panel just put back into service.  He 
traveled from the San Francisco Bay Area, North Bay, to San Diego and back.  
Visited there for a few days, fiddled with my 64 Bug that needed a few 
maintenance items. Couple of little squeaks to do on the Bus engine but it 
ran like a clock. If anyone say him, Green Panel, that was him down 101/1 
through malibu/405 to San Diego.

Anyway.... another bus returns to the road!!!
