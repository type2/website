Not a good plan. Primer is "not" a waterproof product. It is designed to be
sprayed immediately before the final coats of "waterproof" paint are
applied. If you leave your truck unprimered for very long, moisture will
seep into the primer and ruin all that bodywork.

Did you say this bus was 95% complete (?)
