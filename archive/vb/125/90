Hmm... ok, well, the tranny works just fine, goes into all the gears and
such but it leaks like a m.f.  Will he need special tools to fix that?  um,
obviously if i could afford a rebuilt tranny this problem would have been
solved long ago.  But it's not an option.  So, I guess I need to tell him
not to mess with the gears and such, just to put in new seals and gaskets?
