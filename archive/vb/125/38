Hi Nathan,
Rebolt the steering box back in place.  Remove the nut under the horn button 
and either use a hammer on a piece of 2x4 under the steering wheel to pop it 
loose of the tapered fit they have and/or use a propane torch to warm the 
inner part of the steering wheel to make its tapered hole swell slightly and 
loosen on the tapered shaft of the steering box.
