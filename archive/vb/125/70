Steve is correct with regards to a primer surfacer that is sometimes called a
sanding primer.  Using a good quality EPOXY primer is a bit different though.
Use the epoxy directly over blasted or etched metal.  These can be left
outside for extended periods of time.  Granted they are not "water proof" like
a top coat, but they are a two part catalyzed product that is VERY resistant
to moisture intrusion .  I wouldn't go washing a truck sprayed in epoxy all
the time, but evening moisture and the occasional bit of rain should not hurt
it in the short run (approx. a year or so).

I've got parts sitting around in a musty shed that I blasted and EPOXY primed
over 3 years ago and they are the same as the day I did them.  Of course I'm
not washing them either so they should stay a lot longer than something left
out in the H.B salt air.  Besides, just replace and EPOXY prime the small
areas you are needing to.  They are mostly lower parts and won't take the
brunt of overnight moisture.  Leave the blue OG paint on the top....looks
better than priming the whole thing in my book.

PS: I knew you couldn't resist getting your hands on that truck. Better hurry,
you're free time is going to be a thing of the past pretty soon big daddy ;-)
