Subject: 12V stickers for coil????

Anyone know where to get 12V Bosch stickers for coils?
 Mine has 2.  One square and one rectangular.  I want
to paint my blue coil black to be correct for my year.
 My original stickers are in poor shape and need to be
replaced.  Any sources out there for this stickers w/o
buying a new coil?

thanks.
Matt
