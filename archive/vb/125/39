Hi Al,
Loosen the nut on the foraward end of the drag link.  Hold a hammer on one 
side of the pitman arm on the end where the drag link connects through it and 
with another hammer pound it to pop the drag link end due to slight momentary 
side deformation of the tapered hole in the pitman arm.
  Yes, you have C-clips to remove to dissconnect the wiper pivots from the 
linkages in 1966-67 bus.
  If you can not get your taillights bulb holders plated with a mirror like 
finish then paint the insides with white paint.
