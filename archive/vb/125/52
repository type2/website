Subject: 40hp rebuild

Rebuilding an engine for the first time, a mid '63 40hp. A few of questions:
I'm interested in adding a full flow oil filter. Where exactly do I tap the oil
galley to return the filtered oil? I can do this myself, right? Any tips?
Will the later 1600 "doghouse" oil cooler adapter fit the 40hp case? (I don't
have an extra adapter to try it myself.)
The Wilson book seems to push the idea of putting a 69mm throw crankshaft
(stroker in this case) in this engine. Before I dismiss the idea, anyone had any
positive experience with this?
Why am I going to all this trouble on a 40hp engine? I think it is pretty close
to what my early '64 ratwagen was born with. I have a second bus missing an
engine. I have heard the 40hp is a little tank, slow but hard to kill. Real
reason: I only had $18 and I wanted an engine, this one cost $15. What else
could I do?
Other notes:
I have a supposed barndoor mirror arm. I don't have a barndoor, will someone
with a barndoor please take this thing so I don't have to throw it away. It's
free.
Does anyone have an unneeded set of those 25tooth/18tooth reduction gears that
fit the 35mm diameter driven gear shaft (1.39:1 ratio but uses 46mm "big nut")?
I just need the four gears, I'd like to buy them or trade them for 24/19 gears
(the 1.26:1 ones you probably think of as 46mm "big nut" and want if you are
trying to keep up with traffic).
