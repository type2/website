Looking around on Amazon reveals that the Kenneth Ball book is an
aftermarket manual.  "The" manual is the Bentley manual, which
goes into lots and lots of detail about the transmission.

There is another aftermarket manual online 
at http://www.ckoon.org/vw/tranny/tranny.html .  If you just want all
the tolerances and limits in one place, try the "Without Guesswork"
manual at the doc project: http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/wog69.html .
