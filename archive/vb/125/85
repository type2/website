Subject: Re: [VB] Blue Book fro Busses?

"Blue Book" values are just about useless with older cars.  There are
so many variables as far as condition, correctness and wild swings in
the market (think 'eb*y') that it's impossible to nail down a range.
It's one thing to take a 2 year old F*rd Excretion and say "deduct $X
for every N thousand miles" and "add $X for the tow package", quite
another to say "deduct $X for a brazilian-engine and $Y for the rust
in the rocker, but add $Z for the hula girl on the dash"

Your best bet is to wing a price and see if anyone bites.  If they don't,
lower the price or take it off the market.
