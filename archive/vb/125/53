To spend nine months driving across Africa and beyond I sold my non-ACVW
car, liquidated my pension and 12 years worth of savings and hit the road
...

I returned to Johannesburg nearly a month ago on the bones of my butt. My
only remaining assets are my buses, and only the 63 Dormobile and 57 Kombi
are runners.

Luckily I landed a job as soon as I returned, so I'm not starving.
Meanwhile, I'm writing a book about this epic journey, and lots of magazines
are commissioning articles.

I would have liked to publish some articles while travelling, but I found
that crossing Africa in a vintage bus was a full-time job all on its own.

Meanwhile, I'm saving for the next road trip in my Dormobile.
