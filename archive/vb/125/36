Check out item number 1833432732, and I quote "The 64,
11 window split window bus you are bidding on is being
sold as a frame and shell. no glass. The body has
no/very little rust and was to be lifted onto a
running bus that has been sold. " I would of liked to
been around when they were looking for the pan bolts.
