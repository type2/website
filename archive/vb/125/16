I know this subject has been kicked around from time to time, but I =
can't seem to find anything on the subject.

I'm trying to put a/c in the '65, and in the process I think I can use =
the oil cooler heater trick as part of the trade out.

Has anyone used an external oil cooler as a heater source with success, =
or have some suggestions where I can find information on it?

Thanks in advance.
