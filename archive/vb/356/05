Subject: Door handles.

Hi,

I have an early 64 delivery DD  with flipper handles on the driver and
passenger doors. I am looking for  new handles. I have found some, but the
locks don't fit my ignition key type. The key for these handles looks like
maybe a later model, or maybe these handles are from a deluxe bus. I also
found a cargo door handle, but it also does not use the same key type as my
ignition. It uses the same key type as my rear hatch. The key slots on all
these new handles have the little spring covers on the key slots. My old
handles have no spring covers.

I would really like to get some new handles that match the old handles so I
can use my original keys.

Anyone know the skinny on door handles? Know where I can obtain new handles?

Thanks,
Chris
