I see a mention of Chromoly valve spring retainer and exhaust studs on a 
favored auction site.  The heads were prepared by

Audirac VWs of California
2466 S. Santa Fe Ste "F"
Vista, Ca. 92084

(760) 727-1827


Is it worth the effort/investment of using chromoly retainers and exhaust 
studs if I were to clean up a set of my used VW heads for reinstallation and 
reuse??

What are the up sides and down sides of chromoly in VW engines??

Thanks
