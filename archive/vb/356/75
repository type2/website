Well, mine is done.  It took a combination of extensions, reducers, 
etc, but I actually got to where I could operate a 3/8 socket from 
under the bus.  Took the clutch wingnut off too, and pulled the arm 
back with some 8ga wire clamped under the axle tube with a vise grip.  
What a bear!  Next time I will try the allen head bolt and round ended 
socket.

Took the dc down the driveway and up and down the street for the first 
time in 2 years.  Feels great to be back in a bus again
