yes, it is a huge pain. The older engines just had a nut instead of
that bushing, but with the doghouse cooler it made it real hard to get
back there with a wrench. Problem for us in splitworld is the
transaxle has small inset in the metal that allowed this bolt to not
turn while tightening up the nut, however if you want to
tighten/loosen the bolt when you can't just turn a wrench on a nut
(like with your bushing) the only way is from the transaxle side. I
was convinced that there was a trick, or something. Turns out there
isn't. Try every socket in your bag and hopefully something will just
barely grip. after it gets past the inset it will turn freely. Use a
file to take down the holds will help next time. The first time is a
pain, but I assure you it can be taken out/put in from that side. hang
in there.
