Subject: Engine mount

I have a late model 1600 DP and the top left hand bolt hole on the engine has
a threaded type bushing so the mount bolt threads in from the front. This is
not handy for removal and replacement of the engine on the 61 Bus because the
clutch lever makes it difficult to get a wrench on the bolt. It would be
better if there was just a nut on the backside used with a halfmoon type bolt
like the starter on the other side. Has anyone dealt with this problem?
