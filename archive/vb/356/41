Hi Ric,
We used to have lots of cooling problems when we ran 3,800 RPM for a  
cruising speed and found out we where hitting as high as 280 F.  Dropped to  3,000 
RPM and got much better.  Still had problems in 85+ F weather and had  to drop a 
few more RPM to 2,500 - 2,800 range to keep oil temps below 220  F.  
Installed type 4 cooler, 35mm wide fan, "D" largest stock lower pulley  and Porsche 
356 generator pulley.  these latter three modifications  increased fan speed and 
the wider fan blows more air over the entire  engine.  With these changes 
have had our 1960 panel camper in 90+ F weather  and now can keep doing 3,000 RPM 
with only a few minutes here and there with oil  temp getting a little over 
210 F.
