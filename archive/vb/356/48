 Problem for us in splitworld is the
transaxle has small inset in the metal that allowed this bolt to not
turn while tightening up the nut, however if you want to
tighten/loosen the bolt when you can't just turn a wrench on a nut
(like with your bushing) the only way is from the transaxle side. I
was convinced that there was a trick, or something. Turns out there
isn't.
