Subject: re:engine mount

I've had this problem for a while...if you check the archives there have
been a couple solutions offered over the years. Check engine bolts maybe...

I can't remember them all. I usually end up just wrestling with the damn
thing...try one of those paint container hooks. I have them from when I've
painted in the past. They are kind of like an s-hook, you hook one end on a
ladder and the other on a gallon of paint. Under the car, I usually hook it
on the clutch throw-out arm(or whatever that thing is called) pull back, and
then have at it with a stubby gear wrench...

Good luck.
