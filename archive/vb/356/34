Your 64 bus would have comenew with a T series key that fit all door locks, 
and the ignition (unless it came with a steeering lock).

Over the years handles and/or ignition switch may have been replaced.  The 
rear hatch would take a T-series key, so if the cargo door handle takes the same 
key type, great.   Look at the handle, somewhere on the base or the square 
shaft it'll have the key code, which will be T and 4 numbers.   like T1234.  
  67s locks have 2 numbers, an L, and 3 numbers, like 20L123. 
 54-63 handles have a number, a letter, and number, like 1V3 or 2Z5

if your ig switch does not take the T series, it probably wore out and was 
replaced.
the 64 pull drivers door handle wit the T lock is 3 month only, hard to find! 
 the earlier handles  (10/60 -end 63 model) fit fine

the outside handles were the same whatever model, deluxe or standard or panel 
etc.  except the cargo door handle had a short shaft so no inside handle, 
which many prefer to replace with a non panel handle so they can get out from 
inside
