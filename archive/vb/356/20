Subject: Re: [VB] rims / 1 ton

The 63 ton rgb set up has unique drums and stub axles and maybe a couple 
other parts too.  It uses the 64-67 (ie 1 ton) brake shoes.   the nut is 36mm, so 
these are sometimes called 'little big nut' RGBs.  The  gearing is 1.26, like 
the big nut RGBs.  they use the same bearings as the 3/4 ton (cheaper).   If 
you pull the drum off and compare the brake shoes, or look at the drum p/n 
it'll say what style you have.

while big nut RGBs were available (with 1 ton brakes, 1.39 gears, big nut) 
they are VERY rare.  And use the expensive 1 ton lower outer RGBearing.  It 
seems many 63s in the US had the 1 ton set up.
