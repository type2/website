I have a  '66 21-window that I'm restoring and a '73 westy that I'm parting
out. I  was wondering if it is much work to swap over the gas tank and  maybe
upgrade the brakes with the booster and dual circuit brake cylinder  from the
73? Are other parts interchangeable like the wiper motor (I want  to put in a
new wiring harness and upgrade the electrics to 12  volt).



Hi Rob,
The gas tank and dual MC are easily doable if you take your time to do  it 
right.  Check type2.com archives and library for more info.   Wiper motor is a 
little more difficult.   As for the other components  is requires some lathing, 
milling, drilling,  welding.  Which we are guessing since you ask, is 
probably  beyond your abilities.
  Unless your wiring harness is badly burnt, it should work with some  proper 
repair.  Plus will 
do just fine with 12 volts if you go through the wiring to clean, tighten,  
repair/replace components, to get rid of any electrical resistance.
