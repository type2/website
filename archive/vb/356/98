Subject: Electrical Q?

Usually need to "tune up" the bus after it's winter lay over for minor odds
and ends....

So... put the turn signal on and the turn signal indicator light in the
speedo will work for a bit and then goes out.... and may come back again.
Outside turn signals continue to operate correctly and relay making the
right sounds...

Loose connection at the speedo?? or other ideas?

Thanks
