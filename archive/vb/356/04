Hi Tom,
The 1963 only suspension was an option for all buses for that model  year.  
If you want to know if you have that year suspension.  Take off  rear drum and 
check part # inside against the bus parts manual.  For the  front suspension 
it will have the later 1964-67 drum, but the pre-early 1964 20  mm link pins.
