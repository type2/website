Subject: We need money

Hi Volks- your treasurer here.... The Vintagebus/type2 list wealth of
knowledge and advice has and will continue to be FREE to all, worldwide. The
lists are supported thru your donations to pay for bandwidth. We have enough
money in the treasury to pay for 4 more months. SEND MONEY to keep these
resources available. donate(-at-)type2.com  The lists have spawned many of the
regional clubs that you all now enjoy such as the Full Moon Bus Club, the
Ohio Valley tribe, etc. In the last 2 years times have gotten harder and
money is tight, I know as donations have fallen off dramatically. PLEASE
help to keep this resource available. Ted (PS A special thanks the Karl for
sending out parts and requesting a donation to the lists. However, would all
those who have received parts please send in your donations. The amount
doesn't matter. Some people have, some people haven't..... Ted)

Don't take life to seriously -- you'll never live throught it....
