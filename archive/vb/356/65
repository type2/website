I once locked a cat in the trunk of my Ch(-at-)vy by accident for a couple of
hours.  When I opened it again, the cat had done a number on the trunk
lid seal.  The seal profile was an O (the seal part) joined with a U that
pushed over a lip around the trunk opening.  I went to the dealer and got
another seal; I tried installing it in the parking lot, being fairly
careful (I thought) not to stretch it, but it came out about 6" too long.
The parts guy came out and looked at it and redid about half of it, this
time pushing back against the installed portion as he pushed the new
portion into place.  In other words, not stretching it wasn't enough;
it had to be compressed as you put it on.  When he got done the ends met
up fine, the seal wasn't wrinkled, and it sealed all the way around.  I
know a Bus rear seal isn't exactly like this but I thought I'd pass it
along.
