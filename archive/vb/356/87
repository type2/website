Actually it seems that the airflow is increased but I have no way of 
measuring that increase. I was rev'ing the engine to about 3000rpm's 
and the airflow was greatly increased (increase in leaf blower effect). 
I do not know if the flow at the higher rpm's are greater than the 
heads and cylinders can pass. However, doing the pulley change is just 
part one of my master plan. Part two is the Freeway Flyer. That is 
where the pulley will help.

past the cylinders.  More fan noise may not mean more airflow!  The flow
 might be choked to begin with.
