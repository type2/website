Subject: VW garage sale part 2

ok, here is a big mishmash of parts that the splitty crowd may want. 
or not. lots of beetle stuff, too. don't get mad.   =0

make offers.

111-957-021 1954 - 60 beetle speedo, clear needle.  i have 2; one is 
dated 3/56 and still has all the screw-terminal lighting doodads... 
pretty nice shape: some surface rust on back, but bright face and 
uncracked needle.  The second is  dated 4/58 and is a good resto 
candidate/core with a good needle but some face issues.

also have 90 mph bug speedo - great shape on face and body, but broken needle.

2 oval headlight covers - both read hella sb19 sb 20 sb 21 3-60370-3 
made in germany and oben. great shape; a tiny spot here and there 
from rocks bouncing off.

sanyo dc to dc power converter (6v in, 12v out) and one by 
stereo-power of alhambra. that one is kinda cool: looks like a hubcap 
center!  not tested.

111-611-057 bug front cylinder, 65- 79 indian.

johnny's speed and chrome ja mar repair kit, still sealed to cool 
cardboard backer.

ami roc-a-stud kit for replacing rocker arm supports. not sure if it 
is for 1 head or 2.

6v 'blue streak' coil uc-14x. cool lookin'!

empi chrome 6v pulley still on card (loosely - card got wet). i'm 
guessing the mr. bug era ... orange, ca, 92667

6v bosch starter.

'snowflake' rear beetle tail light lens - nearly pristine

113-109-612  four  30 mm exhaust valves, 40 hp. italian ivam. also 
one lone trw one.

about 40 valves guides, most say 1st over, .005. length about 54 mm, 
ID just under 7mm, OD just over 10mm.  36 or 40hp?

4 34mm inlet valves, golf diesel (say what??) trw do brasil.

8 used pushrods marked '40 hp' and 10 new pushrod tubes. pushrod is 8 
1/2" in length; tubes are 10."
one shiny new 113-251-163g... 68-74 bug chrome tailpipe.

2 NOS engine mounts for 68 - 70 bays; you know, the fingers on the 
frame that those little rubber mushroom-looking rubber mounts sit on. 
couldn't find the part #.

if you are really interested, i have a 36hp case, and most if not all 
of the tin for two 36 hp motors. some nos bearings, too.


hey, mostly trash, but it ain't doing me any good in the box, so 
maybe you can use them. matt r, feel free to esplain me how to test 
the converters and coil (ie, values to look for that = 'good').


i also have some of the previous post's stuff for sale - pmail if you 
want a list.
