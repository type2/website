Hi Arnaud,
Can you find out what MPH you are doing at 1,500 in 2-4th and 3,000 in  
1-4th?  
  We found out later that with the largest stock lower pulley that 1.8  is as 
fast a ratio as possible.  We have since then gone to a 356 Porsche  
generator pulley which has increased our ratio to about 2.4:1.  Check the  archives 
for "Porsche Pulley" and "Type 4 cooler" for more info on these.  Also have had 
our bus trannies modified into what is commonly known as a  freeway flier 
tranny.  The FF tranny keeps the RPMs between 1,500-3,000 RPM  and cruising speed 
at 58 MPH (60 MPH with slightly bigger rear  tires).  We never go below 1,500 
RPM except in 1st and reverse, and only go  above 3,000 RPM for short bursts 
to prevent going below 1,500 when up  shifting.  You might need to find a 
tranny rebuilder and get your  later tranny regeared.
