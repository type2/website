Kelly Park the short story:
20 % less vehicles
40% less swap sellers
Good weather
Some good deals
This should be in Clara's trip report.
Long day,  good talking with new and old friends
The Red Barn ( BYOB ) report looks the same :)
With a good camp out!
P & C
Madera then Atascadero

Anyone on the list go to Kelly Park? In past years there were numerous posts
after all the Big Events! I always enjoyed reading the feedback.

What were the highlights?
