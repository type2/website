Eric&Barb & VintageBus,
I read the great post about overheating at
http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/045899.html where you mention
2:1 ratio for fan:pulley speed.

I measured 1 7/8 spins of fan for 1 spin of crank pulley on my 1600 dp
(that is 1.88 :1)  . Is my fan too slow ? I will measure the fan
thickness also.

On highway trips after 25 miles with 70F air temp at 60mph the Gene
Berg oil temp sensor turns on (= oil temp reached 227F). When I stop,
the engine feels hot.

Resume : stock tranny, 1600dp stock (AFAIK), 30/31 Brosol (likely lean
main jet : 120, need to install 125 or 127.5), Kendall wt40 oil,
compression 118-123 psi all around. All engine tin installed, new
engine rubber seal, stock oil cooler. I can feel hot air coming out of
the oil cooler air duct (under the engine, by the #3 exhaust port).
Not that much of air though. Apart from that the engine rocks.

"Warm" thanks
