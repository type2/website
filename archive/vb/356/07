Subject: RE: [VB] Door handles.

Anyone know the skinny on door handles? Know where I can obtain new
handles?

Chris,

Talk to Kevin at the following email. dormaticlocknkey(-at-)earthlink.net

I started with 4 keys for my '65 panel and he got me down to 1 key for
all my locks including my ignition. Very reasonable and responsive.

Regards,

Jason
