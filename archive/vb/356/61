Those old hinges can be saved, quicker than a trip to the junkyard.
Drill the old pin enough to separate the pieces, then redrill
the outer half to .010" press fit a common hardware rolled pin.
Drill the center hinge section for no press fit, hammer will do.
These pins are made from hardened steel and will not wear out.
They have the added advantage of being greasable("YBLG"!)
with a needle grease gun fitting, as the center is hollow.
