Hi,

Since my engine is out, I went and checked on the bolt and clearances. Yes,
there is Allen wrench clearance if you shorten the short end of the allen
wrench. I recommend a ball end driver however for once the bolt is loose, it
will take forever and frustration to remove the bolt unless you can get your
fingers onto the head and the bolt turns smoothly (it could happen!).

Bolt size:  10mm x 1.5mm thread, 70 or 75mm long.
Allen wrench:  8mm.
