Hello,

I have a '66 21-window that I'm restoring and a '73 westy that I'm parting
out. I was wondering if it is much work to swap over the gas tank and maybe
upgrade the brakes with the booster and dual circuit brake cylinder from the
73? Are other parts interchangeable like the wiper motor (I want to put in a
new wiring harness and upgrade the electrics to 12 volt).



Thanks for any help you can give,



Rob
