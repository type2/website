You can look under the archives for a bay window gas tank. I think it 
was E&B that did the write up. They also have a write up on dual 
circuit brakes. Thanks E&B. I installed the bay window gas tank into my 
67. I used the neck off of the stock tank so that I could keep the same 
gas cap. I also sealed the tank with some fuel tank sealant before I 
installed it.

Good luck,

Rocky

Hello,

I have a '66 21-window that I'm restoring and a '73 westy that I'm 
parting
out. I was wondering if it is much work to swap over the gas tank and 
maybe
upgrade the brakes with the booster and dual circuit brake cylinder 
from the
73? Are other parts interchangeable like the wiper motor (I want to put 
in a
new wiring harness and upgrade the electrics to 12 volt).
