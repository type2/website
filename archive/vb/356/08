If I am interpreting the German correctly, Doliwa says:

The 1500 was an option starting sometime in (calendar?) 1962.
However, he doesn't list any engine changes for the 1500 until 7
January 1963.

5 Aug 1963    1 144 303: 1 ton version available
5 Aug 1963    1 144 303: Front axle "knuckle" previously used in 1500
                            Transporter installed in all Transporter models
1 Oct 1964  215 036 379  Transporter with 1 ton and 1500; previously
                            M 215 and M 216.

M 215  1 ton + 1500 (until 1 October 1964)
M 216  1500 (until 1 October 1964)

Bentley says:

August 1962:
Delivery van payload 830 kg.
4.5 K x 15 wheels.

January 1963:
1500 engine available.
1500 delivery van payload: 815 kg.

August 1963 1200:
Bigger brakes standard. (I think this is the "knuckle" change from Doliwa)
Delivery van payload 830 kg.

August 1963 1500:
1 ton version available with 1500 engine, 5 JK x 14 wheels and 1000 kg
   delivery van payload.

>I don9t remember mine having one, but read that all USA DC9s were 1 ton?

A DC-9 weighs a lot more than one ton.  :)  I have also heard that all
Buses imported to the USA since the 1-ton models became available were
1 ton, but I haven't been able to find documentation on this anywhere.
One thing that complicates this is that in many US Buses of this era,
there are some "unknown" M-codes in the 4xx range, that could possibly
include the M 215 M-code.

It looks like the "big nut" rear boxes started with the 1500, so it
would be possible to have a "big nut" Bus that was not a 1 ton.  In
other words:  All 1 ton Buses are "big nut", but not all "big nut"
Buses are 1 ton.
