Greg,

Excellent trip report as always. I especially like the Cake quotes. I 
was blaring Nugget from the iPod at Registration at some point so it 
was really neat to see the quotes on you report page.

I have linked you page to the EveryBus History page

http://www.mindspring.com/~everybus/History.html

along with the gathering pics and stories. Everyone have a look and if 
you have something to contribute, let me know. I can even host some 
pics if you don't have the web space.

Thanks
Chris
