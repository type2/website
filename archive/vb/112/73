Subject: Jalousie window "pain" replacement...

(sic)Pane...

Replacement is relatively easy. It's also easy to ruin your aluminum window
frames if done incorrectly. Don't ask how I know... ;-0 !!!
*Don't* bend the bottom ends (edge closest to the exterior of bus) of each side
of each pane's pair of holders.

Imagine one Jalouise window.
-Carefully remove screen.
-Partially open window (as needed).
-Each pane has an associated pair of aluminum holders.
-Remove screw and retainer for each side of individual (pairs) of holders.
-Withdraw each individual glass pane from the top (edge closest to the interior
of bus).
-*Don't* bend the bottom ends (edge closest to the exterior of bus) of each
side of each pane's pair of holders.
Rubber bumper thingies will most likely crack and fall off of smallish tabs.
-Replace with similar items obtained from hardwares store. Look for items
designed to prevent ceramics on Grandma's shelf from scratching her wooden
counter tops.
-If desired, cut 1 centimeter - 3/8" strips of 4mil shower pan rubber liner
material. Measure to height of each end of individual panes of glass.
- - Clean each pane of glass as desired (00000 steel wool suggested)
- - Superglue into place on each end of glass panes. 
- - Will prevent rattling of glass in future and will be hidden from vintage
Nazis.

If removing from bus:
Carefully unscrew cranks from frames, remove mechanisms and clean thoroughly.
DON'T force the cranks! 90% of the time they don't work because of dirt/old
grease.

- Detail/polish frames:
- - Locate aluminum polisher used by local Harley crowd with industrial buffing
equipment.
- - Pay him if you know whats good for you. (!!)

Reassemble windows in opposite order of disassembly.
Buy replacement window seals from Ronnie.
Buy me a beer at the next show/camp trip/party at Kyle's...
