The SR-71 and X-15 did not get their black color from 29 cases of rattle can
paint from Schucks Auto Supply. Yes, they were black, but that's about all
they had in common with paint you and I can buy. The special heat absorbs
ion and dispersion coatings on the Titanium and stainless steel were
extremely porous and very flexible when the metal underneath expanded and
contracted. Besides the heat shielding coming towards the plane, not from
inside out, they also, on the SR-71, F-117, and other countermeasure planes,
provided radar absorbs ion capabilities, not required on the VW block. The
only thing that the coatings for the afore mentioned craft and your common
off the shelf paint have in common was color.

Back to the physics lab, compare apples to apples, not watermelon.

Al --

If my memory of high school and college physics serves me right, the color
does matter. There's a term "black body radiation," and black objects are
theoretically best at radiating heat. I've forgotten all the details. I also
think this is why the X-15 and the SR-71 Blackbird were painted black -- to
shed heat. Of course, paint is not theoretical; it has a thickness and
insulating properties that may outweigh the theoretical advantage in a
real-world application like painting an air-cooled engine. Best to just
STAIN/DYE your engine black somehow...
