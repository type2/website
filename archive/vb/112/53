 The og canvas and hoops that I borrowed from Paul Reeves to make what at
the time was going to be hoops and canvas for myself, were from his 65 DC.
The canvas had green salvage stiching, grey vinyl trim around the front gate
latch hole & window, and what looked like natural tan canvas straps.
However, when you looked at the back of the straps where they had been
shaded from the sun & weather, the straps appeared to be dark green.  In an
effort to be more correct, I matched that color on the straps.  I am glad to
learn that earlier canvases had other colors.

In any event, I can supply canvases w/ whatever color straps, etc. are
appropriate for the year specified.
