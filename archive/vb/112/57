Just wanted to give credit where credit is due.  I got a new tilt canvas
from Tom for my Binz.  Had to be special made because the Binz bed is a
little shorter than a regular crew cab.  It looks fantastic!  The fit is
excellent.  I'm not sure about the minutia of correct stiching color I just
know it fits good and looks great.
