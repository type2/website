Risking the OT flames, I will use this opportunity to suggest that the
Scarborough facility is still in operation. My 97 GTI rec'd a
"remanufactured" 2.9L VR6 motor last summer from that very place. Very
good quality and a complimentary bump from the original displacement.

Volkswagen Canada used to have an engine remanufacturing facility in
Scarborough, Ontario (part of Toronto). Since VWOC and VWOA merged they
have significantly cut back if not altogether cosed this facility

Just as soon as you state something you know to be true,
some wiseacre pops up to contradict it. Case in point ( ! ) :
I have an "original" Canadian VW replacement V-gon case
( and the " remanufactured "sticker to prove it )
which has some cheap greenish-gold spray paint all over it.
I stripped all but the flywheel area and powdercoated it silver. The
cheap stuff didn't burn off in the oven, but rubs right off with lacquer
thinner. I've seen it before. And inside the fan housing i can find
remnants of dichromate. Dave \X/
