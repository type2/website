Subject: How do I get my parts from Germany?

    Greetings all.

I have a question regarding shipment of parts.  I have purchased a trailer
hitch from an individual in Germany.  The hitch is too large for the post
office to handle.  I have suggested FedEx and UPS.  I haven't got any more
ideas.

How can I get it from there to here?  Any suggestions?

Has anyone ever had something that large shipped?

Please let me know.

Thanks,
Victor
