Subject: RE: [VB] metal flakes in oil! Help! - Painting engine case

I have wondered about this Hoover claim. It seems to be the density of
the metal and air surface presented would be the only variables having a
direct relation on an objects ability to dissapate heat.
I see that black surfaces can absorb more radiant, heat, like black cars
in the sun. I tested this with my new non contanct infra-thermometer.
Black cars were 113 on a 90 deg day, and white ones were 102 .
But the engine heat is internal, and is product of combustion, not
radiant light absorbsion.
Now if the paint itself was thick enough , I could see this as a thermal
insulator, causing the cases to remain hotter.
I too would like to see a naked case vs a white one, vs a black one, if
this theory is correct the white should be the hottest, and the black
the coolest.

Was writ:

hot oil. Paint your proper running engine case blue imetalflake if you
like.<

I would only recommend a "naked" magnesium case or one painted flat
black (what I do - not high temp paint either, just plain Rustoleum).

In theory this will be the most efficient at dissipating heat.  I use
the word theory because I do not have the equipment to prove it :)
Granted I will take Bob Hoover's word for it, as he recommends this
practice and has a much better mechanical knowledge base to draw from
than most people.

Just because Mark Stephen's has nice posters with colorful engines on it
does not mean they are the cats meow.
