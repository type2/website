Subject: RE: [VB] *Correct* pulley for 67 h-case

The easy answer to the correct pulley for the "H" case is, find anything
from 66 on and find TDC, file a new mark if it isn't in the right place, and
forget it.

 Can anyone tell me how to tell a *correct* pulley for an h-case motor?...
 June 22, 1967 vintage to be exact  Also, would anyone have a picture they
 could email me of a *correct* motor?
 
 TIA

I'd look at brochures.  make sure the pic has the pre heat hose running 
forward to the heater box- if it runs down to a pick up pipe through the
rear 
tin it is early 66 or earlier.   

whos going to assemble an on line gallery of vintage original engine pics?  
dated?  please?
