Hey, got me. Anyone out there know of a stealth VW forge in Canada? I have
never heard of an air cooled facility there. I know there is water cooled
cars made there and there used to be a plant or two here in the US. Hmmm,
good question.

OK, then, I'm not versed in OEM. Is VW of Canada a joke ?
Or did they just " remanufacture " only? This case looked new,
and was not line-bored.
