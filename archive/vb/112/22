The paint has to be a market thing. If you look at all your books that show
old pics of the assembly lines, nowhere do you see painted trans or engine.
They have been building this thing for shy of eighty years (figure in the
Mexican, Brazilian, and Argentinean production still going on), so they must
know something! Lycoming and Continental air cooled engines for small planes
are not painted from the factory either. And for that matter, GM didn't
paint the Corvair block. At least none of mine were.

Are you sure?  All of the *original* trans' I've ever pulled were
bare metal.  I think the transmission painting is a marketing-thing
for rebuilt transmissions.
