You are Invited!

Thanks to Rod Kindlund who spent untold hours 
on the new graphics, the FMIJ website has been 
ressurected from a dusty corner on an old 
harddrive and now has a shiny new home:

Everything you need to know is mostly there...

Except that the bridge on South Mills River Road 
is allegedly washed out. A search party is being 
sent on Sunday to attempt to navigate the 'other' 
route involving somehow North Mills River Road. 
There will be clearly marked signs again this year 
to guide you in, they'll just be in different places. 
Advisory: Consider carefully the typical 
composition of a FMBC 'Search Party' and you 
may want to do a little research yourself, just to be 
sure. 

One more thing, Rob 'Hot Dog' Henley will once 
again be serving his signature lunchtime banquet 
on Saturday.
