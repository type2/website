I think the author of that article needs to do some more research. Both my
67 reservoir and the junk yard Rabbit reservoir fit my new 68-71 MC that I
put on the spacer kit on my 67 SC.

The author claims that if you use a '68 and later MC that you will have to
run a remote reservoir.  I guess they never heard about using the Rabbit
reservoir or one of the other options?
