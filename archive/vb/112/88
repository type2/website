Wilson recommends a cure for warped overheated cases damaged by detonation
or run without the cooling fan:
"Sometimes , such excessive heat practically remolds the case so the bores are
drastically out of line. To save such a case, torque it together and bake at 425 F
( 218 C ) for two hours. Then turn off the oven and let the case cool to room temperature.
Don't move the case while it's cooling. Once cool, repeat this heat / cooling cycle.
This will actually reshape the case to where align-boring the main and cam bearing bores
is possible."

Additionally, welding is a viable repair solution to broken magnesium and aluminum alloy cases.
Welding, as you know, puts intense heat into the parent material in a localized area.
This is a considerable topic to discuss.

One further consideration to ponder, powdercoat is not ceramic.
