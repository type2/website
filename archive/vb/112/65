Subject: Re: [VB] metal flakes in oil! Help! - Painting engine case


Hi Adrian,

     Wouldnt you want the paint to be white? so it doesnt absorb heat? 
(compare white and black t-shirts on a hot summer day....)  A white case 
would prolly look cool too.....  ;)  A naked case has been recommended by a 
few friends too......

thanks!
Matt

Was writ:
 >I'm powdercoating my cases silver. Looks kewl. Overheating comes from too
hot oil. Paint your proper running engine case blue imetalflake if you
like.<

I would only recommend a "naked" magnesium case or one painted flat black
(what I do - not high temp paint either, just plain Rustoleum).

In theory this will be the most efficient at dissipating heat.  I use the
word theory because I do not have the equipment to prove it :)  Granted I
will take Bob Hoover's word for it, as he recommends this practice and has a
much better mechanical knowledge base to draw from than most people.

Just because Mark Stephen's has nice posters with colorful engines on it
does not mean they are the cats meow.
