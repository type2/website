Subject: RE: [VB] How do I get my parts from Germany?

  One of the easiest ways to do it is find an airline that fly's non stop
from wherever in Germany to the closet airport to you and have your seller
take it to the airport and put it on an airline as freight. I brought over 2
trailer hitches and a huge box for Rustbus man, cost about 80 dollars. All
international airlines carry freight.

ps. after you pick it up you will have to walk it through customs and pay
whatever duties may be owed, but you will be avoiding the brokers fees.
UPS, DHL and Fed Ex all have ridiculous brokerage fees, but you pay for the
convenience of there service

    Greetings all.

I have a question regarding shipment of parts.  I have purchased a trailer
hitch from an individual in Germany.  The hitch is too large for the post
office to handle.  I have suggested FedEx and UPS.  I haven't got any more
ideas.

How can I get it from there to here?  Any suggestions?

Has anyone ever had something that large shipped?

Please let me know.

Thanks,
Victor
