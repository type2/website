ya- U23 does sound like a westy code.   I dunno what 382 is though.
probably is a US spec package.   Maybe the U of U23 means the extras.  I
only
remeber A, B, C, D westys.  Anyone up on westy codes?  Neat thing about them
is the westys often got a LOT of extra widgets

does the little light on the gas heater knob light up when you pull the knob
out to turn the heater on?  that is so stylee.

do you have any pics of this bus on a web site?


Nawhh...the knob doesn't light up.  It just says "pull for heat" or
something like that.  Its on the left of the "regular" heat control knob.
That heat actually works *very* well.  Stale air system still very intact
too.

The destination code is UV...I believe that means Boston.

I do have some pics up...
