Subject: New Member/Radio?

Hello,
I am a newbie. Cut my teeth on a 71 bus and six months ago realized a 
dream and bought a 67 deluxe. I'm learning a lot - plan to bring my 
lowered bus back to stock - install a ball joint front end and trade 
my swing axle kit for stock tranny.

Anyway - my question is simple - can someone recommend a source for a 
retro looking AM-FM radio that will fit stock in my 67 dash?
Please LMK. Thanks all.
-Dan B
