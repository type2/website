Subject: [VB] Lights work with key off????

Well slowly but surely I'm getting the DC road-worthy.  I've got the turn
signals and headlights working, only funny thing is they also work when the
ignition is in the off position.  Is this right?  If not, what could be
wrong?  I rewired everything as per the wiring diagram, or at least I
thought I did. 
 
Let there be light!!!!!!
