I'm still fuzzy on your use of the word "remanufacturing". Is that like
rebuilding used blocks, or are these "manufactured" new forgings?

Volkswagen Canada used to have an engine remanufacturing facility in
Scarborough, Ontario (part of Toronto). Since VWOC and VWOA merged they have
significantly cut back if not altogether cosed this facility

Just as soon as you state something you know to be true,
some wiseacre pops up to contradict it. Case in point ( ! ) :
I have an "original" Canadian VW replacement V-gon case
( and the " remanufactured "sticker to prove it )
which has some cheap greenish-gold spray paint all over it.
I stripped all but the flywheel area and powdercoated it silver.
The cheap stuff didn't burn off in the oven, but rubs right off
with lacquer thinner. I've seen it before.
And inside the fan housing i can find remnants of dichromate.
