Ben,

I have been told that they also used ash and the original rack I got had two
pieces of the original ash slats left. having said that, I have talked with
another VW guru who has suggested that oak might also have been used. I tend
to agree as I don't think they held constant to one or the other, if
availability and cost dictated the choice at a certain point in time of
manufacture.
