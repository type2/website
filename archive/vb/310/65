Subject: RE: [VB] re:Bus Stalling

Kevin,
It sounds to me like you have something in your tank. This reminds me of a
story Eric from Very Wild Car Co. in Delaware recently told me about a
prank he once suffered from. 
It seems that someone thought it would be funny to take one of those rubber
jar-lid removers (you know: thin, 6" round rubber disc) and drop it into
someone's fill tube. It worked its way into the tank proper where gravity
and suction led it to settle over the drain tube. After the fuel drained
from the line the engine would stall. After a bit of rest, no more suction,
and perhaps some sloshing from a tow or being pushed, the disc would float
off the drain and, voila!: the engine would re-start, only to stall again
shortly thereafter.
Of course, the source of the problem was locked away inside the tank,
unbeknownst to Eric who was working on the vehicle. If memory serves me
right, he changed several components several times, and even went so far as
to flush the tank, but moisture caused the rubber disc to adhere to the
walls of the tank, so he didn't discover it. Everything back together;
still stalls. Finally he just replaced the tank. Problem solved. Out of
pure curiosity and, I'm imagining, some incredulity, he cut the tank open.
There it was: that demonic rubber disc. Possibly the second most
infuriating prank next to sugar without the engine damage.

Just a thought. It's probably not a lid opener, but it could be sediment or
other gunk.
Good Luck
