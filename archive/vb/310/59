I have this seal on both my 66 and my 67. Well worth the $65 and I did not even have to glue it in! It stays
in place.

I have tried the cheapo seal from Bus Depot but it was horrible. It leaked like I did not have one. The
corners [or lack of] funneled the water in.

Not sure what Bus Depot means when they list one!! seal for the rear cargo door from 1950 to 1971....... I
think Ron meant to say 1964 to 1971. He no longer shows the cheapo seal I bought. His looks just like the one
from ISP West.
