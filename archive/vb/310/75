Subject: re:bus stalling

I've gotten a lot of suggestions that my tank is probably dirty or that I
have something in my tank. But I drive my bus fairly regularly...and have
never had this problem...it's not like a bus that had been sitting for a
long time. Would something like that just happen?

I am still wondering how much fuel should I see in the fuel filter between
the fuel pump and the carb when the engine is running? I am imagining that
the fuel pump is not pumping enough gas to the carb, so either the fuel pump
has gone bad, or the line is clogged somewhere between the tank and the
pump. Or the pump itself is only working intermittently...is that possible,
maybe I should try to open the pump up, I think there is a screw on top,
maybe something is clogged inside the pump...

Clara what do you mean by a loose wire? Any wire in particular to look at?

I believe I have two filters, one between the tank and pump (right under the
tank) and one between the pump and carb. It the filter between the pump and
carb is clogged I imagine I would see a lot of fuel in it (because the pump
would be jamming it with fuel and) so since that is not the case, it could
be the filter I have under the tank...although I don't remember if the last
time I replaced the fuel line if I used two filters...

Hopefully I'll have decent weather tomorrow and will take a look under the
bus...try to pull the fuel lines, and replace them...

The idea of a bad coil has also been suggested, this should be an easy swap
too, I don't happen to have an extra handy, I'll see if my mechanic can get
one. My FLAPS only has 12V, so looks like mail order time...
