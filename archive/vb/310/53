Well you know about these people - actually historically they were just
nomadic (sp?) people but they've got a bad vibe these days in the EU.
Anyway picture the scene...
It's a nice sunny and crisp February morning and we (myself and wife
(Sally)) decide to wash etc. the fleet of vehicles. So we are dressed in
'old clothes' for the job. Sally is polishing her Mahle alloys on her
Cal'd T3 (nice) and I'm well doing car type stuff (err.... I kind of
mess with old Fiat as well gulp). Anyway some passerby somments to his
kid that there are the Gypsies!!!!!!!   I didn't hear it but Sally did
and well I just wanted to chase after the guy and say: "but if you look
on www.thesamba.com, you'll see the value of a '57 original samba...."
- I don't suppose it would account for very much though : (
I guess it didn't help that I opted to start the '57 via the crank
handle that morning - just for fun - he he ...
Lee '57 deeeeeeluxe
