Subject: Re: [VB] 40HP Muffler from WW

This happens with some mufflers. Is this a German or Brazil muffler? The
Germans usually fit better.

First of all, bolt up the muffler to the heads and some of this misfit will
correct itself. The heat risers are pretty flexible so they will bend.

Thank you for the feedback.  Although helpful, I have a few issues with this
muffler.  The primary issue is that I have a huge gap between the
left/driver side heat riser tube from the muffler and the heat riser tube to
my carb.  Not only in gap in height between them, but the gap in lining up
the bolt holes too.  No, it is not bolted onto the engine studs, but it is
jammed on there pretty close to where it would end up.

Check it out.

I seem to remember someone mentioning how WW mufflers don't seem to seat
properly, well, I can attest to that now.

Should I force these things together?  How about bending the tube on the
muffler?  Any thoughts or warnings?
