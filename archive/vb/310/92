Hi all. I just swapped out a little nut with a big nut in my 63 Single. Test 
drive reports a smooth shift thru all gears with no pop outs. However, there 
is a loud howl/whine/grinding sound upon de-acceleration. Noise disappears if I 
press the clutch pedal to the floor. I replaced clutch disc, pressure plate 
and throw out bearing with no help. Noise only apparent when I let off the gas 
and coast in any gear. Goes away as soon as i step on gas. Any ideas?
