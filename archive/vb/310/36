Hi Clara,
It is more like $500.00, but like you say it is better than another unknown 
tranny which could leave one in a lurch for a $$$ towing bill.  Also when one 
has a tranny rebuilt one can have the gearing changed to fit the driving needs. 
 Which can result in much better MPG and save you enough to pay for the 
complete tranny rebuild easily in 100,000 miles.  The tranny that came in our 1960 
walk thru panel camper conversion when we bought it, hit 3,000 RPM in fourth 
gear (-at-) 35 MPH.  Which means to do just 55 MPH the engine had to do 5,500 RPM.  
Which is probably why the DP 1600 engine that came with this bus was out of 
the engine bay and in the cargo compartment and had a rod sticking out of the 
top of the engine case!
