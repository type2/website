Sometimes trannys get crusty from sitting.    They have been know to quiet up 
from driving.   I'd drive the bus to warm and shake up the oil, and 
completely change the gear oil once it is warm. Change it again in 500 miles.    Give 
it 500 miles and see if it has quieted down.  I can't hear the noise though. 

axles will turn slightly w/ wheels off the ground/ in neutral.   this is 
normal.

Hay Y'all,
I am working on this 67 that has been sitting for a
few years.
I drove it up and down the driveway today and it was
making a terrible crunching, grinding noise form the
rear end. I Topped off gear oil in tranny and RGB's,
the noise is still there.
I put the back end up on jack stands with the wheels
and drums off and started the engine. When I let the
clutch out, the grinding begins, I also notice the
back axles are turning with the tranny in Neutral and
the clutch out. I go through the gears while it is up
on the jack stands, and the noise gets worse in each
higher gear, its a very ugly noise!  DOes this sound
like a toasted tranny?  Maybe thats why the bus was
put out of commission in the first place???
Any ideas?
