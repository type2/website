Subject: Identifying late spindles

A guy has a pair of NOS bare spindles, however he does not know what year they
are from.

I am pretty sure one of my spindles is bent (the steering stop bolt is bent
and that corner has had a low speed hit in the past), so would like to get the
new ones, however how can I get him to identify that they are the late type?

I have a late backing plate - could I just offer that up and if it fits then
it is the late style or should I be doing something else?

Thanks
Paul
