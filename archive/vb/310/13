Hi John,
Pull out the drain pan, wipe it clean and remove the two drian plugs from the 
center section.  Once drained carefully, and slowly pour this gear oil into 
another container for recycling.  When you get down to the last couple of cups 
of gear oil stop pouring it out and get it in some good lighting so you can 
see in the bottom of the drain pan by tilting back and forth if there are any 
metal chunks as big or bigger than a pin head.  A few hard to find pin head 
sized metal flakes is OK, but if there are plently of them, or bigger chunks, you 
have troubles.  Repeat this proceedure for each RGB.  Hopefully you will find 
metal sharpnel in one of the RGB draining and that should mean all you need to 
do is rebuild that RGB.
