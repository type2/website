Subject: Glass Swap

So ... the glass in the doors of my 60 is pretty bad - it has tons o' little
cracks and air bubbles etc ... it isn't just bad it's really bad - maybe 3 or
4 out of 10.

I have some later glass .. the kind where the latch goes thru the glass - I
hope to use it.  Can I just pull out the glass from the later windows and put
it in my 60 frames?  What exactly is involved in the glass swap?
