Well this is my last weekend in Fort Wayne, IN.  I will be at Lansing,
browsing the swap meet on Sunday.  After I get back we are loading up and
headed South.  Any listees in the area?  We are moving to LaVergne.  I got the
scoop that Roy Rogers is the place to buy parts, as I think I am in need of a
new clutch.

Thanks,
