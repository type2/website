I had a very similar thing happen to me. Mine would run fine for a while
and then intermittently cutout as well. It was really noticeable when I
attempted any type of a hill. I just new it was a fuel filter that was
clogging or the fuel pump. I tore into the fuel system checking
everything the list had suggested, After repeatedly going over all the
fuel components again and again, a friend told me to try just replacing
the coil with another one, he said he has had coils that when going bad
did the same thing. I wanted to laugh when he told me this for I figured
their was now way this could be the case. But since it was a 30 second
attempt at a fix that I had already spent hours on I thought I would
give it a try. Anyway the problem was solved with just an extra part I
had laying around in the shop.
I realize this may sound like a long shot but if you have tried
everything else....
