Thanks to all for the help on the side mirror choices. I decided on the 
elephant ear mirrors. More surface... more vision. Thanks again.

Hi Tom,
We tried the Elephant style, but did not like them due to vibration that 
occured when driving that made it near impossible to see behind us.  So went back 
the the small round mirrors and will be rebuilding harp style mirrors 
eventually because they are about as stable as the round mirrors.
One question. My bus currently has only one mirror on the drivers side. I 
want to put additional mirror on the passenger side. How do I remove the pin from 
the hinge? Do I knock the pin out from the bottom like on my home doors? Or 
is there a special trick to it?
Yes, they do push upward.  Hammering can distort the hinge and the rivets it 
is mounted to the door with, so be carefull.  The original way was to use a VW 
tool that screwed/pressed the pin out.  Good idea to apply some type of rust 
penetrating oil every day for at least a couple of weeks before doing the 
deed.  Or you could try welding to the head of the pin to heat it way up and spray 
water on it a couple of times to help powderize the rust in the hinge that is 
keeping the pin wedged in there, or drill it out the pin if you are good with 
a drill.
