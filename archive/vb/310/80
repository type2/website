Subject: Boycott Exxon

Someone brought this up before, thought it was a good idea.  To get the 
price of gas down, don't buy gas from Exxon or Mobil (same company).  If 
enough people avoid this company, prices will have to go down.  Besides, 
look what they did in Alaska (What oil spill, looks fine to me!).
