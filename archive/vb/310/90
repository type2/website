Subject: SheDaisy's Passenger Seat  Video using a late splittie bus!!

http://www.shedaisy.com/wm/video/passenger_seat/passengerSeat_Small.wmv

Fried egg bus with dings and dents but nice.  Looks to be a driver.  Thought
maybe it was somebody's on the list and knew this story of the SheDaisy
video!?
If anyone finds the full length video let me know as I couldn't get the link
on the CMT site to work.
