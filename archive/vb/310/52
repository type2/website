Subject: Splitwindow Windsheild/Windscreen

I am searching for a Driver's Side window for the front of my '66. Anybody 
out there in Type 2 land that has one laying around please let me know. The 
closer the better to help with shipping. I live in the small town of 
Mooresville, NC.

Thanks,

Michael Knight
