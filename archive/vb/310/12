Hi Everyone,

Thanks to all for the help on the side mirror choices. I decided on the
elephant ear mirrors. More surface... more vision. Thanks again.

One question. My bus currently has only one mirror on the drivers side. I
want to put additional mirror on the passenger side. How do I remove the pin
from the hinge? Do I knock the pin out from the bottom like on my home
doors? Or is there a special trick to it?

You guys and gals RULE!
