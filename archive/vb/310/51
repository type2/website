Hi Rob,
1959 model year was a half and half kind of year to what your bus came with.  
You need to either figure out what month or try entering your chassi number 
into the bus registry on Thom's Vintagebus.com website or supply to this list 
the your chassi number for us to figure out your questions.  As far as 
installing a 1600 that can be done to any ACVW as far back as 1938.
