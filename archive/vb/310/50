Subject: Re: [VB] 59' model year questions

36 hp went until may of 59, when the bastard 40hp took over. if i remember
right all the 36 and the very earliest 40hp still had the crank start.
the split case tranny went away in may with the 36hp.
you can run heater boxes on the earlies, it may take a different tube
between the box and body. i put a 1600 with later heater boxes in my old
early 59 4-5 years ago but i can't remeber the specifics of the tubes.

pressed bumpers?  those changed in august of 58 with the model year, a 59
should be the later style.
the only distinct 59 feature that comes to mind is the very early 40hp with
a crank apron.
