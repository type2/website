Hi Greg,
Since you have the Bentley VW Worshop Transporter manual for 1963-67 bus, you 
should check out section M-5, pages 2-3.  Biggest best thing when installing 
any muffler is to not tighten any of the fasteners down completely till all 
are threaded into place first.  This gives the muffler a little shifting around 
room to allow one to get all the rest of the fasteners in place.  The first 
fasteners to tighten up all the way are at the heat riser tubes of the intake 
manifold, then the head studs, next the ring seal clamps and lastly the fresh 
air clamps on the muffler.
