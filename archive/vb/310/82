Hi Greg,

The WW web site shows the parts arranged pretty much as they are when 
installed in a Bus.  Only thing they don't show are the clamps.  If 
nobody else has a pic handy I'll be happy to snap one and post it for you.

The one problem I have had with exhaust kits for Bus is the tailpipe 
(part # 20) not being formed to correctly clear the bumper and point 
straight back as it should.  It needs to bend down and then back, and 
the new ones simply go back.  You can't have the thing point back 
without hitting the bumper.  I've had to cut a wedge out, bend it down, 
and then weld up the seam.  Other solutions include pointing it down 
towards the ground and then whacking off the part that sticks below the 
bumper so you don't see it.

Let me know on that pic!
