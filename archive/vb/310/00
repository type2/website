Hey Ron, is this gonna affect you and other smaller
distributors of RMMW parts?  Hopefully not too badly,
you guys are the ones who are the real heros, RMMW was
too expensive anyway, but Real source is OUTRAGEOUSLY
expensive. I hope there isn't a huge ripple effect
that makes parts even harder to get.
