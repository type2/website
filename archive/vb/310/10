Subject: Help shipping bus parts from Philli.  (already packaged up)

I have a few bus parts in philli that i need to get
shipped to me.  They are already packaged and just
need transportation.

Anyone in philli who could help?  I am hoping to send
them via FedEx but that is still TBD.

The zip code they are in is 19147.  Never been to
philli so i do not know what part of town it is.

Please email me direct if you can help.

thanks
Matt
