Subject: 59' model year questions

Hi
 couple of questions about the 59 model year:
 
 did they have the 36hp ? was the 40hp an option ?
 did they have the crank start apron?
 did they all have the "crashbox" ( non syncro ) trannies?
 can you put a 160o in and run heaterboxes ( i don't know anything about the 36hp heater boxes) ?

 did the "newer" style (not pressed) come in mid year or were they on all 59' buses ( I guess that would mean late 58' production vehicles? ) ?

 are there any distinct 59' things?

 thanks
