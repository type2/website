Subject: Wind-down windows in a splittie!

Hey Volks

Gisela and I went for a country drive in the Ratmobile (75
Fleetline panel) this afternoon, and found ourselves in the
vicinity of the place where I bought the bus back in January
1993, so we stopped by to pay a visit to the guy I bought
the bus from, a hillbilly kind of guy who has lived on this
farm for the past 30 years and been collecting old VWs all
the while.

He had a really cool November 1958 camper the like of which
I've never seen before. The camper kit had been gutted, but
a really cool feature was the wind-down windows in the back!
It also had a factory-looking sunroof, but fitted very far
forward, in place of the overhead air distributor. There was
also a funky little locker door cut into the left rear
corner, presumably for easy access to a LPG cylinder or
something.

Here are some pics. I got so excited at the winding windows
that I forgot to take detail shots of the sunroof and rear
corner hatch, but you can make them out in these pics:

It's possible this bus was converted in South Africa, but
highly unlikely, given the workmanship. The bus is RHD.
Anybody seen anything like this? Any idea where it was done
and by whom?

And Knautschi? Anybody know wtf Knautschi might mean?
