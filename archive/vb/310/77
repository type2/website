Did you actually just put a bottle of rubbing alcohol in the tank? Like the
stuff from a drugstore? The whole bottle at once, or just a little at a
time...

Kev,
I had the same problem when I got back home from Christmas vacation. I
had all of your symptoms and did everything you did including putting
some fuel additive to take the water out of the gas. I use two bottles
of cheap rubbing alcohol because that is the main ingredient to all of
the products on the market. No dice, so I knew my float bowl had water
in it. I pulled the carb and emptied the gas out of it and then put it
back on. While I was at it I changed the fuel filter. It fired up as
soon as gas pumped into the float bowl and that solved the problem.
