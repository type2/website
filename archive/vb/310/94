I doubt the fisherman and the surrounding residents thought it was a "hoot". I've surfed in Socal so I know about natural seep age of oil but I doubt that anywhere on the planet 11 million gallons are dropped into the water in such a short amount of time in such a small area. Where that the case the coast's would be lifeless and covered with dead organisms just as Prince William Sound was. 
 It has not fully recovered either. There are a few species of birds and fish that have not fully recovered to pre-spill numbers. 
 I know accidents happen and the crew and Exxon paid them as they should have, the way that crew was run was pathetic. As consumers our biggest "vote" these days especially, is with our wallets. Does not buying gas from Exxon make a difference to them? More than likely not, but I'm "voting" my conscience. 
 It's really no different than my refusal to buy anything new from VW. They are screwing around with what I love so why would I want to help them be successful.
