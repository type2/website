Subject: What's happened to bus prices ???

I don't get it - maybe it's true and the US economy is on a high but it 
seems now that you guys will be importing buses from us ; )

I don't mind telling you that I bought YAS 199 (see url) for around #8k 
- the sucker needed a lot of work and I welded for exactly one month 
(the hottest ever in the UK with temps reaching 100 and making the 
record books) - I remember the sweat dripping off my head onto the floor 
plate repair sections I was welding in and sizzling - mmmm (now it's 
cold by the way and my sweat - well doesn't).  Now it seems that my 
crusty old daily driver is worth more than next doors Audi TT <grin>

I'll tell you straight that the UK bus scene is bigger than ever and if 
you plan a trip the the UK this year you will not be dissapointed if you 
can make Stanford Hall, BVF, Bug Jam and Van Fest!!! - they're worth the 
flight - but bring some beer!
