I thought about it, but never got around to it. Never had a problem sucking
leaves or plastic bags into the fan in all the time I ran it like that.
First time I got something sucked into the fan you can bet i'd be out there
shaping some up though. lol.

But it would definitly be a good idea. Keep in mind though, that the
expanded metal will reduce the intake surface area. Wether it would restrict
enough to make a difference or not I do not know. But I would do a check
with the tube and glass of water to be sure.
