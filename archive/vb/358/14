Subject: BusDepot.com on New Server (& Updated)

As of 15 minutes ago, we have moved BusDepot.com to a new server. In the
process we have also begun a series of minor web updates, the first of which
will allow us to start providing more detailed product info for each item.
Also we have added about 1500 new parts.

For a couple of days the old server will be forwarding to the new one, which
may create some problems. If www.busdepot.com doesn't work, go to this URL
instead:

http://busdepot2.webappcabaret.net/

On this note, if anyone experiences anything odd on BusDepot.com (dead
links, error messages, wacky prices, or whatever), I would really, really
appreciate it if you would shoot me an email right away. We tried to put it
through its paces before making the switch, but there is always Murphy's Law
to consider... :-)

Thanks,
