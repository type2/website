hello Eric  That is my findings also . When increasing the CFM you will need 
to increase the air going in.  What I did was to remove the heat hoses and run 
hoses from under the sides of the engine into the compartment , no heat but I 
dont use this bus for winter .  I guess the next thing will be to add more 
vents  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
