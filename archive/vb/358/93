115 to 120 degrees while I lived in Las Vegas. Living there is where I did a
majority of my testing and modifications.

The theory I go by with my motors is that lubrication is based on oil flow,
not oil pressure. The more pressure you have, the more oil is going past the
pressure relief valve, and less is being supplied to the bearings. As long
as I can maintain 10psi per 1000rpm, I don't run oil thicker than that. And
if you keep your engine cool, you don't need really thick oil to begin with.

Not much room in a bay engine bay, but i've thought about how nice it would
be to have an automatic "trap door" open for added intake area for the
engine bay when driven at highrpm/low speed to eliminate the engine bay
vacuum in those circumstances. No good place to do it on my bus though.
Plus, I don't know how I would wire something like that up. It would have to
close back up when engine speed picked up.
