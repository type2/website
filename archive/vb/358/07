Subject: Re: [VB] pulley leak

Usually pulley leaks are caused by too much blow-by and not enough
venting. A friend of my son, had the breather hose blocked off on his
bug. He was leaking oil from the pulley and the dipstick. I told him to
vent the breather to the air cleaner. As soon as he did, the leaks went
away.

Many times I have installed the valve cover gaskets on the old style
covers and had the top edge slip into the rocker arm area of the head. I
have had no leakage from the pulley or dipstick as a result of that
happening. I don't get why extra venting of a misplaced valve cover
gasket would cause oil leakage similar to that of inadequate venting.
