Hi Eric,

I agree, BUT..... That was then and this is now.

One thing in the combo we have no control over is the composition of  
the fuel. The gasoline of 2005 is not the same molecule as the  
gasoline of 1968 - 79. Newer fuels contain additives that the  
manufacturers never dreamed of, and it does affect combustion.  Which  
means that none of our buses will ever run the way they did from the  
factory unless you have a source of 1970's era fuel stock.

Once you add modern fuels into the equation, you pick your poison:

1. you modify your engine to compensate.
or
2. you modify your driving style.  (ie, slow down on hills)
or
3. you shorten the life expectancy of your engine.


Happy trails,
