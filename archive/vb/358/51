Higher compression does not always mean more heat.

Keeping the deck height between .040" and .060" helps make an efficient
chamber. Running more deck (ie less compression) on an otherwise identical
motor will usually run hotter since the combustion taking place is so much
more 'lazy'. Plus, with the added deck height, your combustion chambers
become great buckets for holding large amounts of carbon.  ;-)
