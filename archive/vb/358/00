Schools are ending soon-If it's drivable, you should be able to find a 
student from CO or further who will drive it from a College or 
University out to you and pay them for the gas.  Check with Student Life 
offices and they could post your offer on Ride boards.  This presumes 
you can insure it/get plates and send them to the current bus owner.  If 
not, find if one will drive a rented flatbed if such exists or a tow 
dolly and rented SUV.  As with pennys stocks, the cheaper, the more 
risk! (-8
