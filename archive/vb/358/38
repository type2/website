There has to be some pressure difference between the outside air and the
engine bay, otherwise air wouldn't move into the bay!

However, the pressure difference is very small, otherwise you would see
the body sheet metal being forced inward by the outside air pressure.  It
doesn't take much delta P when you consider the large area of the sheet
metal!  Just a 1PSI differential would exert a force of 144 pounds on
every square foot of the sheet metal.  Figure about 10 square feet of
engine bay on the side of the bus and you're looking at the better part of
a ton of force pushing at that thin sheet metal!
