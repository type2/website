A search on the Samba gallery will pull up plenty of "off roading" pics with
my old bus. Yes, the engine bay got really dirty, but no more than the other
guys that were on those cruises with me with thier "normal" engine tin.

I may drive a box, but I try to think outside of it. Anything can be
improved upon. ;-)
