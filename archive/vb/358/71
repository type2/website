Hi Mitch,
First go to:
_http://www.clubvw.corvallis.or.us/wetwesties/books.html_ 
(http://www.clubvw.corvallis.or.us/wetwesties/books.html) 
 
and then buy the _Volkswagen Transporter Workshop Manual : 1963-1967 Type 2. 
Pub. Robt.  Bentley_ 
(http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0837603919/volkswageofwesteA/) .
 
That way you will have just about ALL the needed info at hand about  fixing 
your DC.  You will be able to impress your mechanic, and fix  things properly 
yourself!!
 
Once you have the info on the reamer you can either find one online, or  
perhaps find a local machine shop with their own reamers that can do the job for  
you.
