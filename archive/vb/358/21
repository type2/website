I would never drive my '71 for four solid minutes with the pedal floored under
any circumstances.  Not enough cooling to compensate.  If I did that and my
engine melted down, I'd call it "driver error."  If I need the pedal floored
to maintain speed and the hill will last longer than about 20-30 seconds, I
downshift into 3rd and slow to 40.
