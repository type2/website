That's good information Eric. I had heard about removing that piece of
tin before to help cooling, but I didn't hear the specifics you have
here. I have trouble with temp creep on my 62, and that was one thing
I was thinking about trying, so I feel much better about it now.

 I hauled off and the temps were rediculously low compared to before. I
 started pushing the bus more and was to the point of flooring the bus if I
 wasn't doing 70mph. No matter how hard I pushed it, my head temps wouldn't
 get higher than 350 and oil temps stayed around 200.
