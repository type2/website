Subject: Curtain Springs

Hiya Gang,
Been searching high and low for curtain springs to hang curtains in my 67
Sundial.

In the old days, you could get them from Woolworth's, Kress's, and most 5 &
10 cent stores.

I've tried Target, Walmart, OSH Hardware, ACE Hardware, Home Depot, looking
on line, etc.

Does anybody have a source for these?  Can't believe that they would not
still be making them, but I suppose stranger things have happened.....any
help or leads would be greatly appreciated.

TIA,
Ed
