Subject: Re: [VB] Speaking of Oil...

I've always used 20-50 and I live in the Bay Area where it get freezing in the winter  (no snow though) and over 100 degrees for most of the summer. 
IFor what it's worth, I've never blown off my HP1 or had any oil related problems.

Hi Roger,
Use it for the air cleaner only then! Multiwieght oil breaks down in hot VW 
engine into the lower wieght listed. So we use 10/30 Wt during cool/cold 
seasons here and when temps are going to be staying well above 50F we change 
over to 30 Wt.. We did try 20/50 Castrol and found the oil pressure in cool 
weather was so high at start up that the oil cooler was at risk of swelling or 
even blowing up.
