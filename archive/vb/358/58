Rocky,
	I've had amazing luck running the 205m dizzy on my 1600 dp,  pict 
34 carb, high compression ratio motor.  The same dizzy made my 1600 sp, 
pic 30 carb, motor run poorly.  This engine does fine with the 009 
distributor.  The vacuum take-off is on the side on the carb.  You 
probably have that right?    Gary Gibson
