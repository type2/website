Subject: Re: [VB] re:overheating, gapless piston rings....

I thought that I'd throw this in....  Just for the heck of it I added 
"gapless" #2 piston rings on a very recent top engine rebuild.  The info 
included with these rings claimed lower engine block temperatures.  The 
only additional guage on my '67 beyond the idiot lights is a yard sale 
altimeter, so I have no real data on hot hot my engine is now getting.   
Running at both freeway and city speeds, the engine compartment and 
dipstick seem much cooler than on the old engine set up.  Interesting, 
especially since I increased the compression ratio from 6.6-1 to 7.2-1!  
I expected more heat.  The heads may be running hotter?   Gary Gibson
