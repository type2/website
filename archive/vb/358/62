I have heard (and seen) that paint doesn't stick to galvanized surfaces
very well.  I have had minimum luck with getting paint to stick to
galvanized house gutters, for instance.  I think the recommendation is
to either sand the galvanizing or wash it with some kind of acid or
detergent first, but please verify this before messing with your wheels.

What kind of quotes are you getting?  I know other listees have had
wheels powder coated and may be able to say if the prices are in line or
not.

2. leave them as is (they look ok, no peeling paint or anything, sort of a
greyish color.)

You might check around the local self-serve car washes.  Some of them
have a "wheel and tire cleaner" setting that seems to have a more potent
than usual detergent, maybe even a little acidic, in it.  I had a
moderate oil leak around the flange of an aluminum oil pan on my F(-at-)rd
and after I took it off the car, the "wheel cleaner" setting at the car
wash cleaned up the pan real nice.
