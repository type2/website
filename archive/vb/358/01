Subject: Sticky brake drum

Well, I get up to go to work yesterday and smell gas int eh driveway. My daily driver '60 Bug ragtop has a nice drip---drip--drip coming from under the gas tank and I had no time to do a diagnosis so I decided to take the Bus, my '65 standard sunroof that is, not the big blue city bus. I back it out and go to close the gate when I notice a streak of fluid on the outside of the right rear tire. Sniff, brake fluid naturally. I check the level and its fine and decide to risk it. Got to get to work and I have extra fluid so I can add some if needed. Luckily, I run into a coworker at the 7/11 while getting a coffee and he offers me a ride so back the Bus goes to wait some attention along with the Bug when I get home.

The Bug turns out to be a simple fix, cracked fuel line coming off of the reserve switch. Reserve switches are cool. Just turn the switch to "Zu" and no fuel comes out. Makes gas line work so much nicer.

I then head over to the FLAPS and get a new wheel cylinder. Pull out the tools to pull the tire/drum, yank out the cotter pin, put the big impact on the axle nut with the expectation of struggle ahead and fwoop, the nut spins like it has no torque on it, which it doesn't. I think uh-oh, back the brake shoes off go to pull the wheel off and of course it is stuck.

I don't have a brake drum puller but I think I might be fabricating one this weekend unless someone has a better idea on how to remove a stuck drum.
