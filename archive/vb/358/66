Subject: Bus needed for photo shoot in SF Bay Area

Can anyone help Larry out?

***

I'm trying to get a hold of a vintage VW bus for a one-day rental. I'm 
with a marketing agency in Berkeley, CA and we want to use one in a 
photo shoot. Any idea how I might connect with someone in the Bay area?

Thanks for any help,
Larry
