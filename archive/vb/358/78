Subject: Speaking of Oil...

So I find myself with a lot of 20W-50 oil.

What's everyones opinion on running this weight oil?

I have a couple 1600 motors and I run 20W-50 in the older motor, but I'm
using 10W-30 in the newly rebuilt motor (didn't have enough 30W around)?

Your thoughts and opinions appeciated!
