At what temperature?

I've used 20/50 during the AZ summer and have had no problems.  On older 
engines where the engine light would come on at idle after a highway cruise 
with straight 30wt, the 20/50 would leave the oil light off, which indicates 
to me a higher oil pressure at idle.  I have seen oil temperatures as high 
as 230F with no trouble.

What was the pressure?  I've started up my 36hp Bus at 30-35F with 20/50 
many times with no problems.  A lighter 10/30 would be better at colder 
temperatures...
