Hi,

I spent a few minutes looking in my Omega catalog. A digital thermocouple
meter with thermocouple can be had for about $100 plus another $30 for a
7.5meter extension cable (want to see the meter in the cab). Go to
www.omega.com. I used my print catalog, so you will have to peruse the web
site to find the meter. the part number I looked at is HH-26K. Type K
thermocouple accurate to 1% plus 2 degrees F. Just need a way to attache the
TC to the head.

Chris
