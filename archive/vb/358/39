With all tin in place, I have had water move a full inch above the water
surface with the el-cheapo aquarium line tubing and water test. This is with
all cooling tin in place. (4000rpm)

With the piece in question removed, the water does not move up the hose at
all. (4000rpm)

With my 79 westy and its factory 'scoops', I can actually make enough
pressure in the engine bay to force the air below the surface of the water
about 3/8" at 75mph/4000rpm. Yes, the scoops are forcing more air than the
fan can pull on it's own. It's very slick.

Assuming there has to be a vacuum in the engine bay in order for air to move
in there is incorrect. The air gets pulled due to the vacuum created in the
fan, not in the engine bay. An engine bay vacuum is just a byproduct of too
much intake restriction to the engine bay. Cut a 2'x2' hole in the side of
your bus, and you are absolutley not going to have any sort of vacuum in
your engine bay, but the cooling system is still going to be able to move
air through the shroud, right? In other words, "No, you do not want any
measureable engine bay vacuum at all if you want your cooling system to
perform at it's full capacity. Period."

Take it or leave it. This information is only being presented to help
everyone out.
