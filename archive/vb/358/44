please note tht i said "LARGE" debris :)  eric was discussing 
removing the front tin, and i recalled someone had done this and cut 
a replacement out of expanded metal - i believe after they sucked a 
plastic sack.

berg had done some scoop work IIRC... but he put the scoop up front 
somewhere. have to dig out my books....

no intention of doin this mod meself - just talkin.
