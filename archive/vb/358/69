Congrats!!!
 
I think the 195X80R15 tires are the best match for the original bias ply in  
the radial version... narrower and maybe slightly taller than the 205x75R15s  
that are fairly easy to find here.   Only time I found the size you  got was 
for about $250 ea, and I am too cheap to pay that. But the narrower 195s  would 
fit under the wheel well easier when installing/removing.  
 
sigh...I want some...

Hey  Volks,

I got my 63 Dormobile back on the road on Friday!!!

The  bus had been standing for two years while its engine sat on the bench  
waiting for me to sort out an oil pressure issue.

.....snip.... Friday I rewarded the bus with new tyres. I'd been  
running 14in rims because it's easy to get the 185R14C tyres here, but very  
hard to find 15in bus tyres. But I scored a butch set of Yokohama Geolandar  
195x80R15 A/T tyres. Not cheap, but look good, with a mild offroad tread  
pattern. They are stock tyres for a Land Rover Freelander. They stand very  
tall, for extra African ground clearance!
