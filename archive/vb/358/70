Subject: REAMER FOR FRONT END REBUILD

Bonjour from Montreal!
In the process of having some initial work done on a newly acquired 67 DoubleCab.
Some of the work is _for now_ out of my leagues.
I don't always have the good sense to recognize as much!
So the mechanic who has given the DC a once-over tells me that the front end suspension will need some work done on the link pins.
Well, good. Over the winter I picked up a rebuild kit, out of WolfsburgWest, from someone on *BAY. A steal.
I'll be supplying these to the mechanic. He, in turn, tells me he needs to locate a reamer for this job. Not a man of many _or elaborate_ words, he just says that the reamers he has already, all for Bugs, just won't do. Can't get any more out of him...
Have any of you done this job before? What's special about the reamer? Any specs? Any sources?

Thanks in advance for the advice
Mitch
