We have been watching this and now have to speak up.
If the motor is in good condition the air fuel mixture is to enter the 
motor via the air cleaner, carburetor, intake manifold, head input 
channels, into the cylinder during the intake stroke. No air should 
enter via the valve guides or other points. Over pressurization of the 
crank case and or bad seals cause oil leaks.
    Other VW information ABC on good morning America, friday AM is 
suppose to cover the Herbie across America kick off from Santa Monica 
prier, CA.
