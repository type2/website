Route the end of the tubing into the engine bay (by way of the louvers on
the body) and tape the end of it so it is exposed in the engine bay. I tape
it to the coil.

Run the other end in through a window and up to the passenger seat. have a
co-pilot hold a clear glass of water and haul off down the road. Have the
co-pilot put the hose into the water in the cup and note how far the water
gets pulled up above the surface of the water.

If it pulls up at all, then you have engine bay vacuum which is hampering
your cooling system. Since the fan shroud has to make pressure to force the
air past the heads and cylinders, if the air getting to the fan is already
under vacuum before it is pressurized, then the total amount of pressure the
shroud is going to be able to make is limited. Thus, hotter running engines.

If you're running a 1600DP in your split bus, and have all of your engine
tin in place, then I can about guarantee you that you have a vacuum in the
engine bay. To eliminate engine bay vacuum, you need to provide more intake
surface area to the engine bay. Tricky part is, you have to do it without
creating a way for the hot expelled air from under the motor to be able to
recirculate back up into the fan. On my old 64 bus I was able to do this by
removing the piece of engine tin that straddles where the engine and
transmission bolt together. This only works if you have ALL of the other tin
in place underneath, and if you have a doghouse cooler, you must duct that
hot air away from the intake of the fan. If you do that, it works
incredible.

With the bay window buses, VW got smart about the design (but not so much
for the looks. My current 79 is nowhere near as good looking as my previous
split buses). The intakes on a bay window bus are actually "scooped" a bit
to force air into the engine bay. While cruising down the road, the engine
bay will actually pressurize to aid in cooling the bus.
