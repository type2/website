Galvanizing can be easily painted over but it takes special primer w/ zinc
chromate in it to make it stick.  I wouldn't sand the galvanizing tho as
it's toxic stuff-it's also nasty to weld on anything galvanized. Your best
bet??? is to have the rims de-galvanized by having a plater professionally
do it. Galvanized finishes are rough & not very smooth for a nice painted
finish. It also does not last as long as other rust resistant finishes, such
as cadium, nickle plating or stainless which I use on my tilt hardware.
Powder coating rules, & they sandblast, can use zinc primer before powder
coating to give you a finish that will last a long time, look great, & be
cost effective when you consider all these factors.
