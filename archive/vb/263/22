well this caused me to go get my shirt out of the bag!!!
my bus is blue not green but that bus shows a bra with a tire cover and i know for a 
fact that my bus bra with wheel cover are a one of a kind.  (after mine jeff and 
robbie said not again!! and that was 1988)  so i guess it must have been my bus as a 
'model'.  can't say about the Fu's bus.  glad i got the shirt now and that isn't even 
why i bought it, i just liked the presentation!!
