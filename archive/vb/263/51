Is coffee toxic  :)  Since I already have an established coffee shop /
espresso bar / coffee roaster in Spokane, WA.  Any unused beans will come
back here to be used in shop.

Sounds like you got a good handle on the whole shootin match.
The only thing about (Is Coffee Toxic?)
You just need proper approved disposal of any partially consumed, waste
or materials used in food preparation or serving and you must take the
trash home with you unless you can sneak it into local dumpsters.
I guess I'm paranoid but I run from burecrats.
After 30 years of running Welding, Plastics, Rubber Hose and now Ceramics
Coatings businesses I've met plenty of rules and regulations that they
can "also apply to you" if they want them to.
I've been trying to get a Certificate of Occupancy since April 15th to
run the same type of business (in a building that I own) that has been
there for 20 years ........... I'm getting the run around.
It's a long boring story and still not resolved but I'm considering going
before the City Council with my dates and times and red tags any laying
waste to about five inspectors.
A little power goes a long way when your work uniform is a condom.
