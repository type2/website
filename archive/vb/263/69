Hi -

sorry to pollute the list with mere correspondance but its very 
bus related -

kevin - I can help you pull the motor out of the 69 and put in in your bus.  Give me a call 617-504-5268 ( my new # ).  Its unlikely that I can get a whole day off from work but can leave early, and the days are still long yet. Does the 69 motor run/ can't remember..
