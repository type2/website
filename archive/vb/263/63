Subject: In need of full length split bus roof rack 10'

Title says it all really.

In high need of a 10' full length split bus rack.  A bay unit might work 
fine, not sure.  I do currently have a bay 6' rack on a split and it works 
fine though.

Why?  I am becoming an interior house painter.  Thus I need a rack to hold 
ladders :)

The job market here, in Atlanta, is horrible for IT people looking for 
work.... So I figure it is a good time to do what I really want and see how 
it goes.  No more being a slave to the man for a while at least.  But I 
digress.

The business should be fun and I plan to service the south-east region with 
excellent custom work and custom murals once the creative artist gets back 
on her feet (Allison Doke - '71 Westi - who recently broke her leg while 
hiking in Yosemite).  If anyone is interested we are currently serving 
Atlanta metro GA, Columbus GA, Northern VA, and possibly downtown Baltimore 
MD.  I plan on being a traveling paint consultant :)

I do have a 6' bay unit for trade if needed or will sell later when I find a 
10' rack.

The only "new" option I have seen is Tom Conner's racks but they seem a bit 
pricey and shipping to the east coast sounds miserable.

Thanks,
Adrian Pillow
