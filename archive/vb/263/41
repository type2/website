Subject: redux box snap ring sources

Hello-

Does anyone have a source for the axle end snap rings for early redux boxes?
Is this something I can find at a hardware store?  I've checked the usual
internet store suspects and come up dry.

I'm putting a freeway flyer light- 4.12 r&p in my '66 bus.  Someone along the
way put early small nut boxes on it.  It even had the detent ball axles.
Looking forward to getting her back on the road without that infernal howling
and jumping out of gear!
