Per both the '54 (picture p. 170, text p. 173) and '67 (picture p. 285,
part p. 289) parts lists at the doc project
( http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ ), the axle end snap ring is
N 12 425, 25x1.2 .  I think that means 25 mm diameter by 1.2 mm thick,
which is exactly 0.984" x 0.0472".  I don't know what the closest
inch-sized ring is or if it will work, but maybe this will help your
search.  Good luck!
