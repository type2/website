Now if we could just think up something catchy that was reminiscent of 
burnt bearings or old, watery chassis lube...

There are two things I've never seen:
#1) A bank robber driving getaway in a Bus / Vanagon / Westy.
#2) VW Busses / Vanagons parked at Starbucks.
I'd suggest that you just get some reasonable sounding names for your
blends.
With some luck and sleepy eyes the VW folks might just buy your coffee in
spite of the YUPPIE names.
Checking in before hand and getting an EPA disposal permit for the coffee
you don't sell might not be a bad idea.
You are also subject to inspection by local health department officials
and those can be trying times (helped a fellow build a barbecue truck.)
Even though the meat was pre sliced in an approved kitchen and properly
stored in heated boxes he had to meet very rigid standards that didn't
even apply to his particular forte of basic sandwiches, canned / bottled
drinks and bags of potato chips / fritos.
The coffee truck conversion sounds like great fun but you may find that
all preparation and sales under a portable tent are the most financially
practical way to go ................ very few laws and restrictions on
that sort of vending because they want to attract seasonal vendors to
public events and many charities have food sales at public functions.
Best of luck on your endeavor.
