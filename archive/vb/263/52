I don't normally do this but your pleading is bringing tears to my eyes. If
you want to mail it to me I will braze it and make a new custom square hole
for you for free since I already have experience in doing this and I certainly
can't make any money at it!

Hey all,

Does anyone out there have an extra dustcap to fit a 67 front drum?  Since
mine's rounded out and won't turn the speedo cable anymore, I want to
replace it.  Calls to my local FLAPS have turned up nothing and I really
don't want to go for a short term fix.
