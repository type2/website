Subject: FamilienFest 9 - August 23rd - NEW LOCATION!!

Hi all, just wanted to let you know if you didn't already. FamilienFest 9 is 
at a brand new location. Not only will this let us grow the show bigger, but 
we will have camping available for folks on Friday night. Come early and 
pick a groovy spot. Wake up and swap! 

More details (and maps) are on our site at:

If you have any questions, please email me at smcwilliams(-at-)axeus.com. 

See you all there! 

Scott
