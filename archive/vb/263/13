Subject: Jerome raffle bus work party

For anyone who is interested and in the (west) Phoenix area, we will be 
having a so-called "work party" for this year's Jerome Jamboree raffle bus this 
coming weekend.  On the to-do list will be installing the freshly rebuilt engine 
(thanks to Jim Burnite & Co.), electrical system overhaul (re-installation), 
brakes on all four wheels, assorted cables, shocks, and tons of body hardware 
and rubber to install.  Also on the list is to polish, polish, polish all the 
not so shiny Deluxe trim.  There will be plenty of hydration and dips in the 
pool (after all it will be 105 or so), plenty of meat on the grill, and lots of 
VW stuff to get done.  If you want to come check it out and HELP, email me off 
line for details/directions.
