Subject: Re: [VB] How do you buy a new/old Beetle from Mexico?

I thought I once heard that you could take the parts of a beetle that
contain the VIN to Mexico and get a beetle sort of built around em.  Is that
true?  And what's up with those Mexican Things?  Were things only imported
into NA in 73/74?  Did they make em in Mexico - they must have - what years?
When did they stop making em in Mexico - anyone know?
