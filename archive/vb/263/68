Subject: RE: lost engine

Hey Rob, that bus is still sitting there...as my hands are over full right
now...maybe I should grab that engine and put it in mine?

I talked to Bob, he sounded ok, one thing that confused me-he didn't like
the oil filter adaptor-he thought they failed too often...so he never puts
them on any of his engines. He suggested I bring my engine out there to go
over it with him, to see what could be salvaged...He is recommending going
to the dual port heads(I had single port).

my square back just broke down too...spark plug hole stripped out...I talked
to this guy at Lein's he said he can put an insert in for about $100, drop
it off in the morning, and ready that afternoon....sounded almost too good
to be true. I am without vehicle right now...

Kevin -

	Hey met you in cambridge that day ( clutch )
	Sorry to here about the engine, if you have the $ Bob Donalds at
Boston Engine will build a 1600 dualport for $1200.  I think his long blocks
are probably one of the most reliable you can get.  ( the best on east coast
for sure ).  He just moved his shop but he's still in wayland ma, a short
drive from sommerville.  www.bostonengine.com

let me know if you need any help.
