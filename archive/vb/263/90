Hi Rex,
Good to see the progress coming on.
I feel a little slack about not working on my 67 Panel
but then I remeber that the average outside temp is
about 39 F & I cahnge my mind and read a VW mag or
manual.
I'd love to see some more pics on your site.
Just out of interest, what is motivating the DC at the
moment?
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
