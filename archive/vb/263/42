"I'm hopin' it was a VW powered kit plane!

***********************************************************************

Speaking of VW powered kit planes.  One of my uncles built one of these.  It's
pretty neat, 1835 with a single zenith updraft carb.  The manifold curves
around and the carb is under and behind the engine.  It seats 2 side by side
and one would never know it was vw powered w/o asking.
