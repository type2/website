I'm totally with you there.
Thing is I've got a double garage that's pretty clean
& it's really only a case of gently wire wheeling the
flakey rust off the underside of the 67 before
applying prep-sol & then painting it with POR or the
like, at least for the moment.
But the concrete is COLD & in the end there are only
so many layers you can put on before you end up
looking like the Michelin Man & can't get under the
bus :o)
Bet you guys never thought it got this cold in
Australia!
What's got me really itching is the fact that my 67
spent the last 9 months at the body shop as I slowly
funded its rust & panel work.
Now it's home & looks great & I want to get into it
but as I write this the icy wind howls around the
corridors & balconies of the high school I teach in.
When the 67 gets running I'll blow the student's
minds.
They're all pretty obsessed with the local GM & F#rd
V8 products but they call my daily driver, a 77
Microbus, a "shaggin' wagon" & some of the girls
offered to paint flowers on it.
Austin Powers eat your heart out.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
