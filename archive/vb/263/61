The caption for the pics of the bus with the westy tent is my favorite. 
Every garage sale/swapmeet I go to I envision the sight of a stripped
tent laying in a heap or cardboard box.  My dream goes something like
this "How much?" I ask "oh for that old awning?  Ummm...how about 10
bucks?  I think there were some black tubes that went with it too".  
"Well, you drive a hard bargain, but I'm in a hurry...OK."

So far, as close as I've come to that is picking up a very nice stripped
poptop trailer awning I'll be using for my '52 Rod and Reel trailer.  I
paid $20 for it.

The search goes on....thats the fun of it!
