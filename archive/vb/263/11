Subject: Tim Johnson's in trouble

Listees,

Just got a call from Tim Johnson who's having engine
trouble in the Minnesota/Wisconsin area.  Does anyone
know of a shop in that area?  He's losing torque on
his head nuts and needs a shop w/ a lift.  If you can
help, call him at 405-612-5168.

He's traveling around the country with his deluxe,
various kayaks, bicycles, and his whole family.
