Subject: Tire size question..

Greetings, Honorable List Members:

I have a quick tire question, as I would like to order some WWW's for my bus, 
but I am unsure of the correct size. Right now I have 15'' stock chromie 
wheels. The bus has been lowered 3.5'' all around if that makes a difference. 
The tires on the bus now are 190/60/15. What size can I go with that will fit 
correctly? The previous owner said something about he should have put 145's 
on, but couldn't find them at the time. Any help would be greatly 
appreciated!

Thanks in advance,
