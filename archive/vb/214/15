Just to be inquisitive here Stosh--
What in the heck would anyone in their right mind want / need an old
Texarcainian license plate?
To remind someone of Georgieland or something like that?

Or perhaps to remind someone of Stanley's Reclamation yard--is that it?

Do you have a plate with a picture of Sam Houston or Davey Crockett on
it--??
How about a likeness of Santa Ana on one of them plates?

Very wild man you are Stosh--:>)

Later,

Mayor Daley

Plates
I just hit on a cache of old Texas license plates. I'll get pics posted
to my site tomorrow. The most impressive of the plates are.
1951 Texas License Plates, Truck, Never installed, Never seen a
raindrop. $90.00
1957 Texas License Plates, Never installed, Never seen a raindrop.
$70.00 These plates are in pristine condition.
There are about ten other sets that are going to be about $10.00 to
$25.00 the set, some are used but might be the year you need for your
classic.
