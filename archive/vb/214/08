This design sure seems like a good way to crack major chunks of plastic
off of the wheel's arms!

Rather than pulling on the plastic, it would be better to make a couple of
thick angle pieces to go across below the wheel hub and then split a piece
of pipe (2"?) to put around the shaft and transfer the force from the
angle to the underside of the steering wheel hub.  This would be much
closer to the VW puller function.
