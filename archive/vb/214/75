Subject: hangin a rear bumper

Hey List,
I am going to be hanging my new rear bumper on my '66 soon. My question
is, is there 2 or 4 attachment points? The bumper has 4 points of
attachment. One at each end and 2 in the center where the brackets go.
The bus only has 2, the 2 brackets. Is there suppose to be a "tab"
sticking out from each side to attach at the end of the bumper? This
would be similar to the front bumper. I'm wondering if maybe a couple
tabs were ground off and filled in by a previous owner. That would of
been cheaper than actually doing the right thing. Of course we all know
that the cheap way is the correct way!
Thanks for your help!!
