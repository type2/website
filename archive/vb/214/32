Hi Tom,
Get rid of the bug rims!  They are much narrower than the bus rims and since 
present day bus sized radials tire are already challenged by bus rims not 
being quite officially wide enough for the present day bus radial tires....  
Plus the bug rims have totally the wrong offset and due to this narrows the 
wheel base increasing slightly the tip over factor of the bus.  Also the 
165SR15s you are running on those bug rims are almost certainly not rated for 
over 1,200 Lbs. (Check your sidewalls for this rating!) where bus one must be 
at least 1,525 Lbs. rated.  Due to running wimpier tires you will have alot 
more sway in the turns and automatic  lane switching when being subjected to 
bow waves off semis passing beside you and/or sidewinds of not too much 
strength when running at 40+ MPH.

  I am also wondering if > it needs new/better shocks

We noticed alot better ride once we installed KYB gas adjust shocks in our 
1963 SC and our 1960 panel camper came with standard KYB shocks installed by 
the DPO.  Also we noticed a huge differance in ride due to bus rated radial 
tires and 1966-67 bus antisway bars when we installed 1965-67 bus suspension 
in both of these buses.
