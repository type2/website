Cal,
I don't think you need to fear the vintage nazi's too much on this point. I
heard from two listee's on the side that both pretty much echoed your same
point.
Now if my question was, how to mount a bumper to keep it from dragging
because the bus is "slammed".................well, I probably would of wisely
kept that one to myself!!
Thanks for the help!!
Tom
