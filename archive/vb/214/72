Subject: Bus Depot Print Catalog now Viewable Online

In association with Google, we now have the entire 50-page Bus Depot print
catalog online. Of course, the actual online web catalog is both more
extensive, and more up-to-date, than the print catalog.  But there may be
cases where viewing the print catalog could be useful (both because it has
some diagrams and pics not currently found online, and also because the
table of contents on PAGE 1 may help you find a part that you might not have
been able to locate in the online catalog).

The link to view the catalog online is :

To order a hard copy of the print catalog, for your glovebox or for times
when you don't have internet access (which may well be when you most need a
part!), go to:
http://www.busdepot.com/ASP/SearchProdId.cfm?ProdId=catalog
and put it in your shopping cart. Added to other parts on your order, it's
$1.00.  Purchased separately, it's $3 including postage but includes a $5
off coupon toward your next order. (If it checks out online at slightly over
$3 with postage, we'll drop it to $3 when we mail it.)  You can also order
it toll-free at 1-866-BUS-DEPOT.
