I put on a new, german produced, stock muffler about 1 year ago.  When I start the motor I get a couple minutes of this weird sound.  Best I can describe it is like a tin can crackle???  Goes away when the engine warms up, but drives me nut in the mean time.

Is this normal or preventable???


Enjoy your day!
