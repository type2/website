Subject: FS Classic License Plates

I just hit on a cache of old Texas license plates.
I'll get pics posted to my site tomorrow.
The most impressive of the plates are.
1951 Texas License Plates, Truck, Never installed, Never seen a raindrop.
$90.00
1957 Texas License Plates, Never installed, Never seen a raindrop. $70.00
These plates are in pristine condition.
There are about ten other sets that are going to be about $10.00 to
$25.00 the set, some are used but might be the year you need for your
classic.
