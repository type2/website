no. i HAVE a nearly-complete (and unassembled) 1700, but the effort 
to get it in a baywindow or a split is more than i want to prank with.
not to mention the glories of all the head troubles the T4 crowd moan about!
what i want is an indestructable bottom end, to which i can attach 
the relatively-inexpensive consumables of T1 p/c and heads!
