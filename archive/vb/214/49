Subject: [VB] RE: Muffler Noise

sounds like an internal baffle is either loose, or partially loose 
from the 'can' of the muffler. it swells when heating, making noise 
until filling the space and stopping the movement. it also might just 
be a 'tight' baffle, and it is actually bending 'like a tin can' as 
you say due to the constriction of its expansion,stopping when fully 
warm.
