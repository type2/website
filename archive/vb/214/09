Subject: Re: [VB] 67 front brakes..

Yes grease can be a good thing but with age and heat it can harden or melt
away thus something stucks or freezes.  For the brakelines (around the tubes
and threads), bleeders, brake adjusters, backing plate contact point and
rear splines I have always used Neversieze on all of these and never had
anything freeze up. My Manx sat out for years and when I pulled the brakes
apart not 1 thing was frozen. The adjusters worked like new, lines loosened
with a regular wrench and drums slid right off. I have been a Diesel
mechanic for over 22 years and we get some of the worse corrosion problems
come thru the shop that a 5 dollar can of Neversieze could have save a
customer thousands. My personal favorite question is "How can Neversieze
work if you don't use it?". I did not use it on the rear splines of my '67
Kombi and had the drum freeze onto the axle stub. 2 days of every tool (1
12" 3 jaw puller was stretched till the arms were straight)  and trick in
the book I ended up haveing to blue flame it. 4-5 hrs of cutting to remove
it without stub damage. Some may agree w/ me and some not FWIW.
