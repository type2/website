Subject: RE: [VB] crap case

  The importer has offered to replace the case less machine work. Rimco did
the machine work and gave the case a green light (he did pay extra for an
expection) before it was ever sent to Craig. I have offered to replace the
case with a case of his choice (less machine work) and have replaced parts
to rebuild the new engine. I have gone to bat for Craig on all fronts and am
trying to get this matter resolved.

said that it was "impossible" that i still have sand coming out of the
casting after many cleanings, grindings and an hour of runtime.

Nobody likes to get cheated but if the Mfg. isn't going to make the case
good you're just going to have to drill out all the gallery plugs and rod
it out with gun cleaning brushes.
