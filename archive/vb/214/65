Hi all - Thanks to those who chimed in with more advice, I successfully 
put my driver's side windshield in tonight.   I used dishsoap on the 
string, and pulled at more of an angle closer to the glass, and it went 
in really well.  Cleaned up tar with wd-40, and it looks great.  We'll 
see what happens when it rains :)  I got mad and really butchered the 
passenger side last sat, so I will have to order a new one after all.
