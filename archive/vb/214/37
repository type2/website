Subject: '67 Campingmobile manual

Hi Volks- I found a manual for a '67 Westy while cleaning out some junk
this week-end.  It is in great condition except that the cover has been
stapled on at the edge. This is an original VW manual. I will give it to
the first person that makes a donation to the Type2/Vintage list.
Whatever you think it's worth. 

Don't take life to seriously--you'll never live through it.
