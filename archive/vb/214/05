Here is a bus steering wheel puller you can make.

3/8 cold rolled steel sounds thin but it is really tough stuff but 1/2" 
would not hurt either. One thing nice is you can drill holes anywhere on it 
and use it for pulling all sorts of other things. And the 3/4" fine hi nut 
can be had at any truck spring shop. if you can't fine grade 8 all thread 
you can buy a puller shaft from Mac or (YUK) Stack on tools. The rest of the 
parts are common items.
