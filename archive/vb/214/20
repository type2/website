Subject: tires

I was real interested in the earlier thread about tires. I have a question
about them now.
We recently had Ronnie Hunter (Atlanta)  Rebuild the RGB's and tranny, plus
turn it into a FF.
It  really makes cruising nice.!~! We are running 165  R15 86s on it. They
appear to me to be bug rims,10 oval slots. To make it handle the wind better
what do y'all think we should mount on these rims.  I am also wondering if
it needs new/better shocks
Thanks
