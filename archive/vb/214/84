Oooh! ooooW!  Sounds like me eight years ago on the eve of my resto.
"Hundreds" will be quite literal in several months. Wait til the "well,
we're down this far, we might as well do that thing too" syndrome kicks
in! Haha!

Keep us informed of your progress! As Bob Hoover once said about
restorations:

"Unless you have a lot of other activities there seems to be a classic
emotional pattern to what you are undertaking. The worst low is yet to
come, followed a character-forming experience. If you survive that, the
rest is a slow up-hill fight but the climb flattens out with each
accomplished step.

"Most of what you'll hear about a body-off resto is bullshit (including my
stuff). They say women are incapable of clearly recalling the pain of
childbirth; something like that happens when you take the restored vehicle
for its first ride. I know this won't do much to bolster your spirits but
at least you will know that everything you are about to do, including all
of the silly mistakes and all of the soul-searching, has been experienced
by a good many of us as well. If you hang in there you will enjoy a
completely new perspective on the world."
