Subject: RE: [VB] Tool organization

In the dream garage in my mind, I'd set up different stations for doing
different tasks, i.e. an engine assembly area, small parts teardown area
(carbs, gens, etc.), a separate small parts rebuild area, and a 'large
stuff' bench (both dirty and clean).  Each of these areas you could place an
appropriate set of tools for the tasks.  Note the use of specific 'dirty
areas' and 'clean areas'.  This way, you could have a set of tools that gets
trashed in the tear down area where dirt, grime, brute force and swear words
are the norm, The parts go to the cleaning stage (high power pressure
washer, gunk tank, etc, and then they move over to the clean area for
assembly.  Again, specific tools for appropriate jobs at each station.
Completed parts then go through the air lock chamber to the positive
pressure clean room where the double cab resides... but I digress :-O

Rex pondered:
Weird discussion here. But figured it MIGHT be something fresh.

I'm in the process of putting my tools away in my new garage/shop.
I'm the kinda guy who has collected odds and ends tools since i was a
kid. Meaning...I find a screwdriver in the street, I grab it. I find
some mix match of metric wrenches in a junk bug, I throw 'em in my
tool chest.....
