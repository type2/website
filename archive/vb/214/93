Subject: Bad Camberg rooms

  I have been trying to get a room in Bad Camberg for a week and they are
totaly sold out, I did find a hotel 7 miles away with rooms, so here is my
question. Does anybody who is going to Bad Camberg have an extra room they
would like to let go of or floor space they would like to share?. I will pay
fot this.

ps. If anybody is still looking for a room I can forward the name of the
hotel I found, they have a few rooms left
