The wasserboxer case can have the water jackets cut off and then be used
with type 1 pistons, heads and cylinders to build a type 1 aircooled
engine that bolts right up.  IIRC, the cylinder stud holes have to e
relocated (though I think that offset studs would be easy to implement)
and an external oil cooler has to be plumbed for the aircooled
application.

Food for thought.
