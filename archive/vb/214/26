Subject: BEST AUTO SHIPPER?

I am looking for an auto shipper that is above the rest.  I need door to door 
service from Heidelberg Germany to Colorado Springs.  The  must be in an 
enclosed trailer  during transport and be shipped in  a  sealed container on 
its own.  The vehicle is very high dollar, and I don't need an 18 year old at 
the dock breaking keys, damaging the car.  So  minimum handling is a must.  
any ideas volks?
