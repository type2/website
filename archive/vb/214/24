Rex, I have two tool boxes, one is my "road box" that stays in the bus,
really has proven it's worth on many occasions, not just on my bus, but
other's as well.

My second box is my "shop box" which has all the specialty tools that I
would only use when the bus is in the shop.

Being an old shop teacher, both of my boxes are well organized with all
sockets on a peg board and seporate drawers for metric and american sizes.

If you're going to keep your shop tools in the shop, you might want to use a
peg board for all your tools, it will keep your tools handy to find and you
can tell when one is missing.
