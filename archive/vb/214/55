Subject: Re: [VB] crap case

A little clarification is needed here. In just about every state in the union, the retailer is
responsible for the quality of the part, service or whatever they sell. This is called the "implied
warranty of merchantability". In layman's terms this means that, when something is sold to anyone,
it must be usable for the purpose for which it was sold. This little bit of good old English common
law does not apply to the person that manufactured the item, it applies to the person that *sold*
the item.

The only exception to this is when an item is explicitly sold "as is" with no warranty.

I agree that Ronnie is being a stand-up guy on this matter. Kudos to him.

It seems that every time this case comes up Ronnie
gets an unintentional slap over it.  If the beef is with the manufacturer
or importer then put his name in the post, not Ronnie's.

I'm sure Ronnie rues the day that he sold this case.
