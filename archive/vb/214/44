> I put on a new, german produced, stock muffler about 1 year ago.  When I start the motor I get a couple minutes of this weird sound.  Best I can describe it is like a tin can crackle???  Goes away when the engine warms up, but drives me nut in the mean time.

1) are you sure its the muffler. If it is it sounds like it is hitting
the frame somewhere.

2) It also sounds like the sound a cracked fan hub makes.

At any rate to me it sounds like a mechanical sound. Something loose,
rattling etc....
