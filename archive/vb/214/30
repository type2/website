Subject: Got it runing, but idles slow, unresponsive to adjustment,

Ok, we changed the super old NOS Solex thick gasket under carb to new paper
style, and tightened 10mm SP intake manifold mount nuts. Had to cut a 1/4
10mm socket in half to get the driver side front, what a PITA.
Now, engien runs at 7.5 static timing, idles at a lopey 600rpm. Not very
repsonsive to throttle, needs a good  throttle level to get up there to 1200
rpm. CHoke doesn't help much, without it won't idel at all.

Question, can I change the intake gaskets without reemoving engine, assuming
I have a generator in place? Seems there might be enough up down
clearence....

Any advise to get a good intake manifold seal? Bentley and Later Bentely
doens't have much tecnhique or advice.
Changing ingition timing has no beneficial affet, I am certain we are right
on here.

I might give up and have Lehmanson rt100 finish this off, but it sure was
nice to hear her run some more.

TIA,
AL
