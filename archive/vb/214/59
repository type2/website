I wonder if the answer to your desires isn't a wasserboxer bottom end?
All-aluminum, designed and built by VW de der Fatherland, and has already
spent a long time in a working engine.  Perhaps it's time to start
stocking up on blown wasserboxers!  I'll bet that the machine work to make
a wasserboxer right is less than that to make the aftermarket aluminum
case right.
