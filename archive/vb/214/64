Subject: Re: [VB] Tool organization

I've tried a bunch of different things- my latest scheme  ( that I am 
very happy with ) consists of organized sets of all the everyday tools 
in holders (sockets/wrenches/ screwdrivers).  I can always find 
everything I need.  I also have years worth of oddball tools, generic stuff, 
and incomplete sets (as well as a few found on the road ) all thrown in a 
big tool box.  This is where I go when I need to modify or sacrifice a 
tool.  It doesn't pay to get rid of the old ones...
