Hi Don,
When pulling the rubber lip of the seal over the body ridge you must go 
slowly and pull at about a 45 degree angle in relation to the surface of the 
glass toward the center of the window.  There is also a point that pushing on 
the window and rubber too hard will cause the rubber lip to be pinned between 
the glass and body ridge.  When installing seals we give the window and seal 
assembly several pushes around the perimeter of the glass into final place.  
If you put the three inch cut off area of the seal in a straight area it 
should do just fine even if you use it for years and years.  That part of the 
seal is more for retaining the window and seal assembly in place, not for 
sealing.
