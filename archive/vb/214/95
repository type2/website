Subject: Re: [VB] 1963 bus

the large rear hatch was started at the beginning of the 64 model year.

to have 15 windows, the bus needs a small back hatch, so that is 63 and 
earlier

to have 13 windows, the bus has a large back hatch , so is 64 and later


except those brasialian buses, which still have corner windows much later.

<< Hello List,
 Help me settle an argument. Can a 1963 deluxe have 13 windows instead of 15. 
 If so, when was it implemented.
