Subject: Re: [VB] Eating clutch cables...help ? - sorted

Nice!? Hope it all stays together properly now you fixed the fixit guys fix :)

I pulled the lever from the frame this morning to find the short arm to have been put on the wrong way - doh! that was the breakdown guy on the first snap.?

So I just put it back on the right way and filed a little more material from the cable clevis to give it a little more movement if required. Fastened it all up and the clutch feels ten times better, much lighter now.?- Lee?
