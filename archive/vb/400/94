Subject: Re: [VB] Eating clutch cables...help ? - sorted

I pulled the lever from the frame this morning to find the short arm to 
have been put on the wrong way - doh!  that was the breakdown guy on the 
first snap.

So I just put it back on the right way and filed a little more material 
from the cable clevis to give it a little more movement if required.  
Fastened it all up and the clutch feels ten times better, much lighter now.

Cheers all
