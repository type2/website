Subject: distributor needed!

Hello guys and girls,

It's been several years since I've posted on this list, nice to see it's
still here and functioning. My 67 deluxe is still on the road, and it's
living in a garage here in San Francisco, and gets to go out once a week
for the grocery run, mostly for its sake, as one really doesn't need a car
here.

I'm in serious need of an original vacuum advance distributor - don't need
the cap or rotor, just a functioning body with all the inner bits intact.
The exact model I need is:
VW 113-905-205T, Bosch 0231 137 035

I don't need the vacuum piece - I've got lots of them from the years
of hoarding parts back when. What is critical is that there is no
excessive side-play in the driving shaft, and minimal vertical play would
be nice, but I'm assuming I'll be replacing the missing washers etc.
anyway. The 2 cap-holding clips gotta be there too. I'll be installing my
Crane electronic ignition into it - which is still working after all these
20+ years.

If anyone's got one of these that they'll sell me, lemmee know. You can
pmail me at the usual cjay(-at-)well.com, or I'll check the list.

Thanks all,

cal
