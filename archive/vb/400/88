P & C
But always carry spare cable(s)


My '71 westy has been through three clutch cables in less than a year.
The clutch is really light too, yet the cables are physically snapping 
at the ends.  There does seem to be a lot of end float before take-up on 
the clutch lever (on the tranny).  Is this just a worn plate or 
something like an incorrect release bearing,  too thin perhaps ?
