Subject: Re: [VB] Recommendations for a digital advance timing light...

You can feed 12v timing lights with a 12v source and time a 6v car.

There are also battery operated smaller ones now that work on either.

6v only ones are only vintage ebay fodder for the most part. I have
not seen a modern dual voltage one, I stopped looking much last year.
