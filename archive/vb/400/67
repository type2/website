Subject: Re: [VB] wipers-what do people use

Wiper pivots aren't aftermarket, they are for the safari windows so
you can open them. You could get a 'one eyed duck', the holder for the
folded in wipers, plus the disconnecting wiper shafts and have wipers
that fold inward without safari windows in place, you would
essentially be provisioned for a future safari install.

as for wipers, I use SWF wipers by hunting around for NOS ones. They
have a softer double edge sort of construction, not like the ungiving
solid chunk you get on the repo wiper blades. You can always tell
becuase the real ones mush the rubber a tiny bit, where the repos
stand like soldiers on the glass.
