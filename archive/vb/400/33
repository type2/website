Subject: Re: [VB] Vintage VW /Hazet tool auction

This is our first auction, so we are new with this.  Several bidders 
requested to know what the highest bid is, so each night we will update the 
web page and post the highest bid at the bottom of the page.  Your bid will 
be confidential until at which time the auction has expired. For identical 
bids the arrival time of the e-mail determines  the winner so if you see 
your bid price in the "HIGH BID" area, it might  not really be YOUR bid. Be 
aware of this to avoid final day disappointment. When the auction time has 
expired we will post the winner's names. Non-local winners will be expected 
to pay for actual shipping cost to  your door. We will determine the 
shipping method you prefer us to use and calculate the cost after the 
auction ends. Payment is expected within 5 days from the time we notify you 
of the total after shipping is added.

Happy Bidding.
