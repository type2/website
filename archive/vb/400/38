You can gently pry them apart with a screwdriver, the clip is only
held in place by a small ridge.  Put a rag or piece of tape over the
hole so you don't lose the clip as it springs off.  The end of the
inner shaft is ball shaped, so you have to center the clip over the
ball and press it back in place when assembling it.

On the car?  I would use a timing light to see if the advance changed
with engine speed (vacuum disconnected).  Off the car, maybe someone
local to you has a distributor tester?
