Subject: distributor overhaul for 1600 DP

I'm still looking for a replacement distributor for my
1600 DP, w/34PCIT-3.  The numbers are:
Bosch number - 0231 167 055 or 0231 176 033
VW Number -  211 905 205Q or 043 905 205D

I have a couple leads.  Now I'm looking for overhaul
instructions, namely, how do you separate the two
distributor shafts?  There is a clip ring at the top
end under that felt oil pad.  Is there a tool to take
that apart?  I am working on a 205AH which isn't
really the right distributor but very similar, it's
for a bug.  Also, how do you troubleshoot the
mechanical advance section?

Thanks
