Yeah, that's the puzzler end of it.  It's definitely #2 and #4 though.

That's my thinking at this point - a bad seating of the manifold.  I'm 
pretty sure the carb to manifold is ok, so I suspect it's the manifold to 
head...

INTERESTING!  I hadn't thought about it from this angle.  I'll keep this 
in mind if the manifold isn't the issue...

Thanks for taking the time to respond...
