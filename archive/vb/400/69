SWF or Bosch are the only good ones.  SWF blades are sold by VW p/n, but the
Bosch ones (when you can still find them) have their own number, 3 397 110
275.  Check with a Bosch parts store, they might be had still.  I just got a
nice pair of NOS arms and SWF blades from the WCM 'everything goes' garage
sale.

The one-eyed ducks are cool too.  But then you'll start jonesin' for
safaris, then a rear, then a rack.  <sigh>  Then you're broke like the rest
of us!
