Subject: Re: [VB] concrete slab

Well its Friday and back in collage in materials lab Philip made 
concrete mixing larger rocks, then smaller rocks, and then sand so 
untill all voids were filled and only added  cement as a bonding and not 
just a filler.
Then kept it in water for 28 days,  as concrete has a 50% strength 
curing for 7 days then 50% more at 28 days etc ......
The sample tested at more than 20,000 psi,  the instructor Mr Smithson 
was very impressed.
So choosing the correct % of aggravate and maintain the additions of 
water can increase the strength a lot over 2,000 to 3,000 psi. range.
O yes,  it will still crack!
