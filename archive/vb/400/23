On the vintagebus list, it was suggested that the bus was stretched 6 inches
or so to accomodate the space between the cargo doors.  However, if this
were true, there would still be room for the 4th pop-out wiindow.  It is,
after all, a deluxe, complete with corner windows, and should have 4
pop-outs on each side.

I really like the side step.  Makes me want to create something like that
for the flipseat.  'Course, I need to have jack points that will support a
side step first.  Oh well......
