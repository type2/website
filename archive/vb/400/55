Hi Tom,
Try checking the valve train is opening the valves properly, or better  yet 
remove the rocker arms and push rods for inspection.  Have  had a push rod 
break and somewhat keep opening the valve by the broken ends  that kept wearing 
down rather quickly.
  Could also be you have some bent push rods, so they flex more than  opening 
the valves.
  Last guess would be the lobes on the cam are damaged or worn  down.
BTW did you make sure your rocker/valve geometry is correct?
