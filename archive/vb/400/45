Subject: Re: [VB] Westy top

Looks OK to me. They painted the outside of the top. M7 '79 was all fiber, no gel coat left. 
They didn't install the canvas to the top correctly, the strip and staples should not be visible from the inside. 

You're right Sam.  If you see a '73 in a junk yard, get the flat front hinges to pass on to a listee. The tubular '68-72 hinges bend easily.  

As far as I know, all poptop bay Westys were made from sunroof models. Karl?
