Matt,

Sorry about the slow reply, been on vacation to the Glacier National Park. 
Didn't see a single split. Saw about 3 bays and about 3 eurovans. Two were 
set up as campers. One with  a pop top.

Thanks for the extrapolation. 2,340 may be a good number.
Does that number support all the after market stuff that is available? 
Interesting question.

Chris
