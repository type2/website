I agree the West Coast Chopper thing is waaay over-hyped.  Yes, Jesse is 
cool IMHO, but posure wanna be yuppie rub biker fags should not be showing 
off his WCC apparel.  Ranks up there with fake pony-tails on "bikers" and I 
use that term loosely.  I do not see many real bikers out there these days, 
maybe it is just too expensive for the average rider?

Speaking of old skul, the magazine DeLux (or DeLuxe) is really cool for 
modern hot rods.  They cover a little of all rides.

... For the record I do not have a bike.  I do want one though.  And it will 
be bad to the bone with a hardtail and jockey shifter...  Maybe even an AMF 
era Sporto ironhead on a chopped out frame :)  Yups need not apply.

Later,
Adrian
