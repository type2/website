The crush donut gaskets ususally need to be tightened down again about a
week after they are first installed, especially if they are the newer 'steel
wool' looking gaskets. The 'crush' needs to be crushed again so to speak.
When I was in high-school, way back then, I had a peashooter fall out on me,
and I thought my car was the baddest sounding car in the parking lot. I
liked it so much I replaced both peashooters with regular pipe. It sounded
really bitchin'. At least to a highschool kid.  :-)
