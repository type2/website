Subject: Thanks for all of your help here!

I really do appreciate the help everyone offers here. I feel like I can go
ahead and do it myself with the ideas that you guys have recorded here. I'm
not the only one who experiences frustration. There is a lot of planning
that goes into these buses. One of my two buses is parked awaiting new
engine. While I'm building it up, bus #2 tranny starts acting up. Now I need
to plan a tranny replacement ASAP along with break-in new engine. I'm trying
to focus on what I'm doing now. Do it well or have to do it over again.
focus on being thorough. I'm learning a lot more than just mechanics through
this experience. Thanks everyone.
Dave
