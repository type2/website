Before I por-15'd under my 60 I had to remove that tar stuff - it did an
amazing job protecting my bus for 40 years - but where it started to give
way -and in a few spots - rust formed under the tar.

To remove the stuff I used a propane torch and a paint scrapper and did
about a square foot at a time.  Then I used one of those gardening squirt
bottles that you pump air into and fill that with gasoline and pressurized
it by pumping and squirted gas on the remnants of the tar - it worked
amazingly well - but very dangerous.  I kept two fire extinguishers close at
hand and I had a hose running water under the bus to wash the gas and
residue away. I tried lacquer thinner but it cost way more than gas and it
didn't work any better.  Dangerous? yes.  Effective? very!  I was very
careful.
