Subject: how much air

well, T2 came back up, so i dug out my post:
http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/031429.html

the guy also told me how to make a graph similar to the factory spec; 
put a dot at x = MAX LOAD # and  y = MAX TIRE PRESSURE as marked on 
the tire, and draw a line back to the zero point.  should give you a 
ballpark way to see how much air to add to THAT particular tire as 
you add or remove weight......
