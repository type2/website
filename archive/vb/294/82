Subject: OT: Vanagon List?

I'm hoping maybe somebody on the vanagon list can forward this question to it?  
I know I should wait until Friday but....
My boyfriend is trying to install a shoulder seatbelt on the middle seat of 
his '87 vanagon.  VW discontinued the belt but we found one from the bus 
depot.  The problem is we don't know what size the bolts are supposed to be, 
and we're a bit nervous about trying random sizes, since it is a seatbelt and 
we don't want to mess up the threads and all.  VW has been no help on this.  I 
tried searching the vanagon archives - seems this is a popular topic but I 
couldn't find the answer to this question anywhere after about an hour I gave 
up.
