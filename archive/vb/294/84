A bug muffler on a bus, that's part of the problem, almost sacririgleous

Driving down the road and noticed my bus sounded louder than usual [not
that my bus EVER sounds loud, just heard the engine above my radio.]

When I got to work I noticed one of the two pea-shooters was gone ...
Could it be another bolt that the Mechanics From Hell forgot to tighten
??
