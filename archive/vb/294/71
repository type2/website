Subject: i'm back

Been gone for a little while, barely keeping my head above the work...but my
bus started giving me trouble starting(like last winter)...i talked to a
friend of mine-he said it sounded like choke problems, I checked the type2
library, and saw a great write up by ron van ness...then I made adjustements
accordingly, and now it starts up no problem!

Thanks...to you 
And thanks for giving...enjoy a long weekend.

-Kevin
