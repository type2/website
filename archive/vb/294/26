i wrote wrong in caps because you inferred that underinflation was no 
prob, and better than over. not  trying to be insulting to you! i 
read all your posts so it isn't that i think you don't know nuthin :) 
just that rollever lawsuits were VERY big deals in texas at the time 
i was buying my tires, and everybody... dealers, tire folks, lawyers, 
gubmint ... was talking about underinflating = badbadbad.

as far as overinflating, my favorite reference is in fear and 
loathing in las vegas, where thompson has the gasjockey inflate his 
tires to like 90psi  - till they sounded like teak when he tapped em!!
