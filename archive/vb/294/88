Subject: RE: [VB] deep sump question 

Mike, on the deep and half deep aftermarket sumps I put the screen and
gasket stack back on. If the kit you bought was correct, it came with a
sump tube extension and your screen fits back over it. One thing to
remember, most of the aftermarket deep sump kits had sump extension
tubes that fit the larger hole 71-79 DP screen instead of the earlier
1500 screen.

I have bought a deep sump for my van should I refit the tea strainer.
