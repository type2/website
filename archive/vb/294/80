Subject: Blocked heat riser?

How does everybody clear out a blocked heat riser?  The one on my bus
managed to get clogged at some point over the summer, and now when it gets
cold, my intake ices up every chance it gets.  I took off my muffler to try
to work on it, but I can't think of a way to clear out the blockage.  Any
ideas, people?  Thanks.
