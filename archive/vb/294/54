The turn signals (including the arrow light in the speedometer) should
only work with the ignition on.
The hazard flashers should work any time.
The light on the switch knob should only blink when the hazards are on.

The 9-prong box has two power wires - one switched with the ignition and
one on all the time.  If your dome lights work, the all-the-time fuse
should be OK.

The problem could be in the switch.  Pull the brown wire off of the
switch and ground it really well to the body.  If that starts your
hazards working, then you either have a bum switch or a bad ground
from the switch body to the dash.

For far more than you ever wanted to know about it, read
