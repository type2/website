Tommy,

Freedom Camper was another camper conversion company based in CA, LA area I believe.

The 'snowtop' campers that you see every now and then are Freedom Campers.  That top was an option for that company.

They had some cool features, but mostly similar to Sundials, EZ's and Rivieras.  If I remember correctly, it had a tall cabinet behind the drivers side bulkhead instead of a jumpseat.

If you are heading out to BBB in Havasu, I'll bring the Freedom Camper brochure (copy) with me.
