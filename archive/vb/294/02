Kurt,

FWIW, the ends were welded up to about March 1965.  You can see the
leaves (maybe after cleaning off the grease) when you look at the end
of the torsion bar with the torsion arm installed.  After that, they
weren't welded, and the torsion arm had a washer in the end to help
seal things up.  The Bentley, pages V-6 1 and following, has good info.

All of the new shocks I've put on, for various cars, would expand
themselves all the way when free of the car.  You can try to compress
the shocks by hand; it's hard to do this with new shocks but with old
ones it's easy.  If the shock expands again after you compress it, it's
at least working a little, but if it stays wherever you put it, it's
probably dead.

>No, the bolt should not be bent.

When I got my Bus, somebody hadn't tightened the nuts on the front upper
shock bolts all the way.  The nut wasn't loose on the bolt, but the bolt
was free to slide back and forth about 3/4" in the frame horn, letting
the top end of the shock bounce around.  New bolts and tightening them
all the way fixed that.  Probably not the source of your rough ride,
but it could be another reason why the bolts are bent.

I agree with the idea that the shocks you have on there may be too long
for the Bus.  Shocks will add a little ride height, but most of the
weight is carried on the springs, so taking both front shocks off and
letting the Bus sit on its front wheels will give you a pretty good
idea of how long the shocks should be.  The correct shock will be a bit
longer than this, because it should be compressed a little in normal
driving.

Even if the shocks aren't too long, they could be working in the wrong
part of their range.  The Bentley (p. V-6 5) mentions that the shock
absorbers work harder / get stiffer the further they are compressed.
If your shock is working in the "1 ton of stuff in the Bus" mode when
it's just you in it, that would make the ride stiff.

Good luck!
