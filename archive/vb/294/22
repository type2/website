This is WRONG! the tires were UNDERINFLATED, and underinflated, 
substandard tires combined with crappy ford design to doom people who 
drove the combo at high speeds. ford told folks to UNDERINFLATE their 
tires to make their crapass explorers ride 'smoother.' underinflation 
causes -severe- internal  heat stress to the tire.
here in phoenix, a dozen or so people die on the highways each summer 
as their UNDERinflated tires overheat and shred.
you are in FAR more danger from under-inflation than over-inflation. 
overinflated tires give you a harsher ride and will 'let go' in hard 
cornering sooner, but i'll trade that for throwing the  carcass at 70 
mph anyday.
