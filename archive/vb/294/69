well not too much drag and not too little, but 
...just right...

I guess it means just barely feeling it, but not hard to turn through.   as if it's too tight you'll wear it out prematurely.  And the click, well thunk whatever.  metal contacting metal.  

My old one made a crunchy thunk.  sounded like a bad bearing.

hope this vagueness  helps
