Bolt with pointed end and 4-sided head with safety wire hole.  VW part
number 111 711 189 per http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part.html .
Good picture on page H-2 3 of '63-'67 Bentley.  I obtained replacement at
FLVWPS when I bought new front shift coupler.  Possible COTS source from
local hardware store carrying metric set screws.  Modify by drilling hole
for safety wire.
