Quote me where I say that, and i'll eat my words. Just because I'm not
supportive of overinflation, does not mean I'm in favor of underinflation. I
vote for "correct" inflation, which is completley different than
underinflation. I even mention that I add a couple pounds to the figure the
formula gives you.
