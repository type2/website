The last time I flew (Post 911) I had my gas key (Church Key) on my key ring
and they wanted to take it away till I explained what it was for!  They also
thought that I had some Allen wrenches cause the batteries in the bottom of
my carry on must of looked like a L shape in the X-ray.  They asked me if I
had some Allen wrenches and I said no and proceeded to empty my carry on
just to find the batteries.  What did they think that I was going to remove
the Pilot door
