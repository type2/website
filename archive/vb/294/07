Subject: VB] Re: Another Lazy Mechanic - maybe one of these will help?

Im kinda tired of reading about lazy mechanics. They are not necesarily lazy 
but
maybe just smart enough to judge what they are walking into. The next guy to 
work
on that bus is probably the next guy to get ripped apart on this list as a 
half ass mechanic.
(thats been in business for 30 years.. being a half assed mechanic). Like we 
all said you
need to work on it yourself, or find someone qualified locally that will 
help you. Shops do
NOT want to work on these, and we have read the reasons why. (from you, no 
less).
A bus is a very specific car, a gm or ford guy has no reason to be working 
on most of the
things that need maintenance on busess. Even all but a very experienced vw 
mechanic
has the specific tools or knowlege to mess with them once:
a) its been sitting for years neegrlected like most of them have
b) its been gone through by several local mechanics
c) someone isnt ready to pony up and get everything done right and at once.
  Someone recomended the wizard in Miami. Hes done some work on my cars. Hes 
great.
Your bus wouldnt leave the shop without at $3000 bill. Think im kidding?
