The PO of my (very-long-term-project) 65 managed to spill an orange 
soda pop which pooled anywhere it could AND mixed with very old 
horsehair from the 2/3 seat which then dried with the orange soda pop 
to create a composite material comparable to the space shuttle re-entry 
tiles in density... and the ((-at-)#(-at-)#( ate pistachio nuts and just 
sprinkled the shells EVERYWHERE...
