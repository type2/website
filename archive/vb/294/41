Subject: Re: [VB] Bar and Chain Oil

Funny - I got lots of different responses to that question.  I think I'll
give the bar and chain oil a shot.  Every one who has actually done it
describes it as excellent.  I have por-15'd under most of my bus and it
looks very good - I just think that the bar and chain oil would be awesome
over any of those spots that were tough to get.  Bar and chain oil - is
chain saw oil that contains phosphoric acid.  I suspect it is very close to
the Rust Check stuff.
