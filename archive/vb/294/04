Cool.  It sounded good but I wasn't sure.  Maybe I'll try it the next
time an oily friction surface presents itself.

This has probably been done better, but now I have stuff in my head
like:

A time for splits, a time for bays
A time for rust, a time for paint
A time to lower, a time to raise
A time for six, a time for twelve
To everything, turn, turn, turn...
