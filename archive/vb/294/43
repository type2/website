Subject: Re: [VB] Bar and Chain Oil

Not to mention, the bar oil will get where the POR 15 won't such as inside
the frame rails.  Oil will also penatrate where the POR sits on top.

Back in the 70's an old body shop man told me to drill holes on the inside
of places where there is double walls and squirt oil ever winter season.  My
dad purchased a huge 1973 Ford wagon which we started this treatment on.
Since that time I have done it to a number of bugs and busses.  If you know
anything about the early 70's American cars, you know they were rust traps,
but that old yellow boat of a car is still rust free!!  And here in the rust
belt, a rust free car is usually no older than a couple years.

You just can't get the POR 15 where you need it to keep things from rusting.
I've seen metal coated with POR that was rusted out from behind and the only
thing solid was the POR.
