Subject: Air Cleaner

              I want to change my air cleaner in the oil bath for a simple air cleaner on my 1600 CC weber carb. And finnaly take off my oil bath air cleaner.
   
  Do i need a special connection between the carb and the new air cleaner ? 
   
  Somebody can tell me what is the number of the cleaner and the connection if i need one ? (on CIP1 pls) 
   
  Its is better with a bigger or a smaller filter ? 
   
  Thx you
