Thanks Guys!!!

Yes, I have for years wondered why my bus wanders the road. However, I 
thought there was a roller bearing on the torsion arm! Just a rubber 
bushing?

I suppose that to replace the bushings means a tranee removal. Am I right?

 Always remember:  The rear of a vehicle steers it; you just correct it with
