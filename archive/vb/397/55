Well, you still got a bent Bus, but this probably actually helped.  A
chunk of the energy went into accelerating your Bus and flinging it
down the road rather than bending things.

It kind of looks like the white Astro van was a little nose-low when
he hit you, like he was already starting to brake.  Either that or your
Bus rode up on his front fender really well in the process of getting
lifted up in the air.
