Subject: Re: [VB] Powdercoating a Roof Rack

Hi Ed,
We would go with finding a zinc plat shop to do that.  The  problem with 
powder coating is where there are two surfaces coming together in a  tight angle 
the powder coating paint tends to be repelled by  the magnetic fields being 
generated in the tight area.  If you do  powder coating have them apply a marine 
zinc primer, and then the color  coating you want.
