Subject: constantly running on three cylinders 

hey-
i have been having a cronic problem with my '67 bus since about thanksgiving.
every couple of months i lgradually oose power and eventually end up running
on three cylinders and when i take it in to the shop they tell me one of my
spark plugs is fouled up. this has happened 4 times now and i  am getting
frusterated and discouraged.

does anyone know what would continually cause a spark plug to get fouled up
and an engine to run on three cylinders. i am not very mechanically minded,
but do some things with my bus, but have relyed on my shop to help me with
this one, but so far eveery time they replace the spark plug and adjust the
carb eventually the same problem occurs AGAIN and AGAIN.

any ideas?
