Hi Sean,
The inside angles we are referring to are more like 45 degrees or  less.  
  Just took a look at a short 1/3 German industrial roof on  our bus.  With 
the six front to rear tubes running under the  four left to right tubes you 
have two angles at each junction,  for 48 of these tight angle areas.  Then with 
two of these angles at  each arch supports at each leg, one has another eight 
tight angles.  Total  of 56 tight angle areas.  Of course 2/3 and full roof 
racks will have  that much more of these tight angles.  All of these are exposed 
to  full weather on a roof rack  Where engine tin for the most part is  
fairly well protected in the engine compartment, and all engines have  exude some 
oil vapor to help keep that rust away.
  Have had same problem with powder coating rims where the outer part  of the 
rim meet the inner, but have hand painted this area to keep out the rust  
from there.  Because of chip resistance of the powder coating it is worth  the 
extra care of touch up painting this area to us.
