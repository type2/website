Subject: Powdercoating a Roof Rack

Hiya gang,

I've got a full-length Roof Rack on my Sundial Camper that I would like to
Powdercoat.  The rack is the early style, with the horseshoe-type clamps.

Would Silver, or possibly a flat Silver, be the correct color to do this
application with?

I live in the Southern California area, and am wondering if anyone could
suggest a Powdercoater to do this job?  Also, does anyone have a feeling
for how much it would cost to do this job?

Any help/suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated.

TIA,
Peace,

Ed Richardson
