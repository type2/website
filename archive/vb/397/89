Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] urethane or rubber torsion arm bushings

Has anyone ever just done outers? by removing the cap, installing a new
talced bushing and retoruqing the cap, keeping plate, rgb, and trans in
situ? Mine aren't really bad (that I can detect), but I am considering just
freshening the outer for now and doing the inners next winter. I know it's
half-(-at-)ssed, but most things seemingly easy and quick are.
