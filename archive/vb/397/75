tire term) .. and skinny .. really skinny .. maybe 4 1/2" wide .. it is
perfect for holding up the seat in my 60. The fatter tires I run on my bus
prevent the seat from sitting exactly right so I keep this one .. I'd like to
find a set of tires that match the specs of that old firestone knobby tire
(btw - I'm sure it would be too unsafe to put on the bus). I'm wondering what
is the skinniest LT tire I can get ... for a 15" rim.

While an ancient tire probably won't make your bus drive too great, you can 
get new Firestone bias ply tires.    Thise are skinnier than the radials.
You can get Firestone 6.40-15 tires through Coker.

I've also used 205 75 15 radial tires.   These are much fatter, though pretty 
closer to same diameter.      I think you need a higher proportion dimension 
to get the same skinniness.  the fat tires don't fit as well behind the seat, 
or in the back tire well (walkthroughs)

  The trend these days is for wide, short tires, which does not help us get 
many options as far as tires for the old VWs is concerned.

hope this helps... I think you could do some online searches and find a 
really knobby truck looking tire... The ones on the '55 don't look super knobby, 
but I bet there are some out there that do.
