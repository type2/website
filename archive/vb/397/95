Thomas,
I had the same problem, it was because I installed an aftermarket air
intake on a bone stock 1600 sp. I kept upping the jet sizes but I
could not get the proper fuel air mixture so I burnt out my
heads(brand new) in about 2000 miles. Also I was going through #2
spark plugs about every 100 miles. The root problem was to lean or to
rich of a mixture (maybe you have a bad carb?) and that my valve seats
were shot (does she backfire when you come to an idle, not very loud
just a popcorn pop?) I rebuilt my heads and put the old oil bath air
intake back on and re-adjusted the carb back to stock, now no more
problems.

Also one more thing do a compression test and see what you get. They
should all be within 5psi of eachother and if any are under 90 getting
close to a rebuild any under 80 you need a rebuild NOW! When I did my
compression my #2 (the one that kept burning spark plugs) was at 75!

 does anyone know what would continually cause a spark plug to get fouled up
and an engine to run on three cylinders. i am not very mechanically minded,
but do some things with my bus, but have relyed on my shop to help me
with this one, but so far eveery time they replace the spark plug and
adjust the carb eventually the same problem occurs AGAIN and AGAIN.
 any ideas?
