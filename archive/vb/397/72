Hi Walter,
If you need to replace the frame members that run left to right under the  
cargo floor.  If the floor is in good shape leave it in  place.  Best to build a 
rotisserie for your bus.  Like:

If you have to replace the frame members that run front to back you are  
going to have to build a temporary frame to keep the body from sagging!!   Saw 
images of a bus in Europe that had complete frame replacement and a full  shop 
was needed to do the work properly.
