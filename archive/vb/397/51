Hi,

My name is Mariah Wilson, and I am working on the History Channel
series Our Generation, which takes a look at the people and events that
helped shape the Baby Boomer generation. Previous episode topics of the
series have included The Ford Mustang, The Apollo 11 Moon Landing, The
JFK Assassination, Toys of a Generation, Disco, Kent State, and the
Summer of Love. Our Generation airs four times per week and is seen by
more than 1.6 million people.

We are currently working on an episode about the Woodstock Festival,
and are planning to shoot a "road trip" going back to the site of the
original festival, with our host and one of the performers from the
original Woodstock. We figured there would be no better car to make the
trip in than a Volkswagen Camper Van. I wanted to send out an inquiry
to the Vintage Volkswagen Club of America to see if anyone in the New
York city/state area had a VW Van that we could possibly use in our
show, and feature on the History Channel.

Please let me know if you know of anyone, or if there is any way of
sending out an email to all members of the Vintage VW Club about our
search for a van to star in our show!

Thank you very much in advance -

Sincerely,

Mariah Wilson
