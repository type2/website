Subject: caramel brown

I've had a hard time finding seat covers made of caramel brown ... so ... I
happened upon a guy at a local high school who teaches upholstery.  He pulled
off the seat covers on my 78 .. seperated the plaid seat fabric from the vinyl
.. then re-assembled them with new piping that he made .. he took clear
pipping and put the original green piping inside the clear stuff .. He put new
stuffing under the seat covers etc... those seats are better than new!

I had him do the front seats on my 60 .. IMO he matched the caramel brown
vinyl perfectly .. there are a couple of pulls on the cover but ... total cost
$175.00 including new stuffing on top of the original horse hair .. hmmm maybe
$150.00 U.S. ...

I was planning on recovering a z-bed and rear facing seat with the same vinyl
but without the pleats .. now I'm wondering if I could use my original back
seat and have it fold down into a bed ... hmmm ...
