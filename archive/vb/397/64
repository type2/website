Subject: Appraisers in Florida?

Anyone have any suggestions/recommendations for getting an appraisal on my
so-44?

Someone in Florida willing to travel to my bus on the north side of
Orlando would probably be good.   I could probably trailer the bus maybe
an hour away (the tow vehicle is a 1960 1 ton International . . . ) if I
had to.

A pre-wrecked value is the idea, of course....

I've been gathering ads and ebay auctions as well.

All this assuming that the snafu with the other guys insurance gets
cleared up. ("driver not covered" and "vehicle not covered" are their
reasons so far for denying the claim....)
