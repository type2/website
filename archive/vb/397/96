PS 
I had a fouled plug on the Chirco long block i ran
from N. Mex.
the ring gaps were lined up the piston and pumping oil
into the cylinder

oops.

that is

 the ring gaps were lined up on the bottom of the
cylinder allowing the
piston to pump oil to the cylinder.
This was evident by the fact that the heat riser
gasket had a oil leak.

could they turn on their own?

the rings, do they ever move?

Here's the weird part, I was waiting to do the valve
adjust when i got 
into Cal. 
Then when started adjusting to i discovered  a intake
rocker 
completely off the push rod. 
I was running 60 mph on three cylinders.
I would smoke on starting and after idling but not all
the time until 
the plug fouled fully

lessons learned; 
its not a ch**y stupid. Wait for the oil to run down
to the sump, then 
check it.
The oil was pumped into the cylinder and when our hero
checked it at 
the gas stops the stick showed low. When our zero
added oil, this was 
pumped out the exhaust  or was burned by the then not
fouled plug.

Weird baby!

not half as weird as my English

aloha
