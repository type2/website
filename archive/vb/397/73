Subject: Welder Needed for Clips

All,

Apologies up front for the non-Bus content, but I with my Bus looking pretty
good I'm gonna spend some time on my Type I.

Looking for a welder that can install a front and rear clip on a 72 Beetle.
I scored a cherry set of clips off another 72 that caught fire near the fuse
box. 

The catch is that I am down in Sierra Vista, and can't find any experienced
VW welders.  At this point, I'm willing to take it to Tucson if I have to or
maybe farther.

Someone please throw me a bone!

TIA,
Fel
