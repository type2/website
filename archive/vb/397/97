Subject: Good Wiring Harness?

Volk-a-maniacs,

So, last weekend the wife and I went to Lost Wages (Las Vegas for those of
you who have not had the pleasure) and thanks to a penny machine of all
things, it paid for the whole trip.  So I have a little money to spend on
the kids. er. uh. I mean the buses.  Both of the buses are in need of wiring
upgrades and whilst I have the cash, I would like to tap your combined
experience in choosing a good product and/or vendor.

Who has the best wiring harness for a '63 panel/camper convert?  

Also, would the same wiring harness work for a 59 Single Cab?  There appear
to be none specifically listed for single cabs and I can't think of too many
wires in the main cavity of a bus where the bed would be on the truck
anyway.  All of these harnesses show to support a range of years from 58 to
63, so should I assume they will work for both the panel and the single cab?

It appears they come in two categories. 
Main = Engine up to fuse box (no front/dash) 
Complete = Engine to fuse box with the dash too.  I assume I should get the
'Complete' since I want to rewire everything. 

Here are the options I found today.

Any others I should consider?  

I care about quality only slightly more than price on this product.  Quality
meaning. wire colors match original scheme and lengths are appropriate.  So,
if anyone has suggestions, comments, or warnings, I would appreciate it. 

Thanks,
Greg
