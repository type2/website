Subject: Rubber bushings once again.

As for replacing only the outer bushing: that will place the entire load 
onto the outer bushing and cap. This could be bad if the bus was loaded to 
the gills, however a lightly loaded bus MAY be ok. The bushing are designed 
to each handle half the axle load, so if you place the entire load onto the 
outer bushings and cap, you could cause trouble. Replace outer bushings 
only, WITH CAUTION.
