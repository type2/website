I had my engine tin powdercoated 8 years ago and haven't had any problems.

  Hi Ed,
We would go with finding a zinc plat shop to do that. The problem with 
powder coating is where there are two surfaces coming together in a tight angle 
the powder coating paint tends to be repelled by the magnetic fields being 
generated in the tight area. If you do powder coating have them apply a marine 
zinc primer, and then the color coating you want.
