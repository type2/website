Subject: RE: [VB] camshaft gear trials

Actually Kevin, that's a good question. No, Cam gears are not all identical.
There are small tolerances in all the parts and that is why you should
measure gaps, lash, etc. Generally speaking, the crank cam gear and
distributor gear is the last thing you should have to worry about. That is
why there are different cam gears lash sizes.

Can we take a brief time-out to explain what + and - cam gears are in newbie
terms? Another newbie
question, could the shop have switched cam gears on him? Are these gears
matched?
