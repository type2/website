Subject: CFM for Foreign carbs

OK,
Somewhere in my pile of stuff I had the information for SAE CFM computing
for foreign carbs. I had a whole chart the rated everything from the 21mm
carb to the 48 Weber. Now I can't find it, WHAH! My CFM calculator on my web
page doesn't do the conversion I want. I was looking at a drag engine made
out of four VW engines and fed by one 850 CFM carb and wondering what would
be the equivalent foreign carb at each head.
