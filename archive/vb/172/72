Hi Volks,
You will also have to change the regulator that goes with the generator.  We 
have used 6 volt starters with 12 volt solinoids and 6 volt horns on 12 volt 
systems for 100,000s of miles with no problems.  The 6 volt starter on 12 
volts makes the engine really spin and due to this the engine starts quickly 
even in freezing weather.  Plus the 6 volt horn is way LOUD to get the 
attention of those fellow drivers whom seem to drive without looking around.  
Since these six volt items are only used for short periods they do not get 
too hot and burn out.
