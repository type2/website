Hiya Sam,

The distributor you're looking for is VW 113 905 205T.  Although this was the 
original "stock" distributor, there are other distributors which will fit and 
function in this application.  Point your browser over to The OldVolks Home 
at http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ignition.htm  for further listings of 
applicable distributors.
And FWIW...........  the SVDA offered by Aircooled.net is wonderful in this 
particular application.  It's what I'm running and I'm very happy with it.
