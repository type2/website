Subject: BEWARE south austin machine and parts!!

while putting the timing gears on my crank the other day, i was 
unable to get the cam gear all the way snugged before it cooled down 
enough to seize.
so. i took the assembly to south austin auto parts and machine, a 
business that was supposed to know cranks (tho they admitted on 
arrival they've been doing less vws the last few years). i had the 
spacer, dizzy gear and snapring all stacked up IN ORDER , explained 
that i needed the cam gear pressed down a little farther, and the 
rest thrown in on top. no problem they said.

get the crank back... cam gear and dizzy gear sit cheek-by-jowl.
um, no.

they laughed and said "gosh, we've got another one just like it back 
there; glad you caught us!"

they pulled off the dizzy gear, put the spacer on again and reapplied dizzy.

um.............  this time, they broke the dizzy gear.

they said they would take the one of that OTHER vw crank they had, 
and order him another one - upon inspection, his was the color of 
butter, as opposed to the NOS german one i HAD. i passed on 
unknown-origin brass, and just got the hell out. they did NOT offer 
to refund the cost of a gear, or the money for the labor.


now i gotta clean all my used dizzy gears and look for a good one. 
and hope they didn't bodge anything else up  :P
