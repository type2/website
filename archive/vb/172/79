Wasn't this part of the thread about the cam gear not getting put on right,
a couple of times? Could very well be a bent nose on the crank. I had a
similar problem on a wedge mated crank for a prop hub in place of the pulley
for a hovercraft. I couldn't see it just spinning the crank around, but fire
it up with a prop on it ! Whew!

Time to verify the crank for straight.
