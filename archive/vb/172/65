What broke and whose Bus did you steal the lines from?

The '65 harness should be fine.  A '65 doesn't have the nine-prong box
for the flashers - it has a regular flasher plus a relay for the hazards.
You'll have to change all bulbs, the horn, the turn signal flasher, the
hazard relay, the coil, the choke heater, the generator, and the battery.
You can get a 12 V wiper motor or use a resistor on your 6 V motor.
You can run the 6 V starter as-is until it dies, or install a 12 V
solenoid on it for longer life.  If you go to a 12 V starter you'll have
to change the flywheel.  Apparently the fuel gauge will still work OK
on 12 V.  You don't have to change any of the switches.  If you have
trouble finding the 12 V hazard relay, you can fake it with two
off-the-shelf relays.
