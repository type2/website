Subject: Re: [VB] Repro taillights.

The one's I got from WW weren't the prettiest thing out there, but they do
work fine. The little contacts, two on each side, that touch the lightbulb
terminal thingies required a bit of tweeking and bending to get proper
contact, but that didn't take much time at all. The lenses left me really
wanting a set of NOS ones, though:(
