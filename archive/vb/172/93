Subject: further cam clues

ok, so i went out and a) put on my cam degreeing wheel, to see if i 
could detect any wobble at its outer circumference (none)
and b) cobbled together a stand for my dial indicator, which showed 
that the nose of the crank varied no more than .03mm when turned. so 
should be 'straight.

pranked around some more; set end play again, a little tighter - damn 
near locked. found that my OLD cam, which was previously used w/ this 
gear, would no longer jump out when the crank is rocked. this cam is 
a std.
BUT. if the crank is turned 360 (finger on cam thrust bearing 
lightly) i find that it binds slightly once per revolution, no matter 
whether the crank is turned cw or ccw. the relevant teeth are just 
after the halfmoon key(as seen when spinning cw)as the key rolls 
towards the bottom of the case; i thought maybe they were nicked, but 
they look fine, and clean.  this binding is a bit less when in cw 
direction, but it still will visibly 'pop' it out a bit; if you hold 
down the cam, it binds enough to cock the camshaft a bit and thrust 
it forward.

i don't recall this behavior on the previous engine.
