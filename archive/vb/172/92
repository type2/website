Subject: [VB] OACDP dying a slow death

Hello list!  Anyone who has visited the Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation
Project (OACDP) probably noticed it hasn't been updated in a while.  I'm
here to admit it's not due to lack of material, but to lack of time and
overabundance of other things that need doing.  As a result things aren't
being done and the site, although it already has good content, is stagnant.

I would like to see if anyone is interested in taking over maintenance for
the site.  I have one set of scans I am going to try to finally put up this
weekend, and after that I'm done for a while.  Anyone interested probably
already knows what is involved but I'd be happy to answer questions via
p-mail.  I've posted this to the list since most (all?) contributors have
been from this or the type2 list and a majority of content is type-2 related.

Basically I don't want it to die and would love to see it in the hands of
someone who will work with it more often.  If nobody is interested I'll
continue to maintain it at my glacial pace, but already a couple documents
I have turned down due to lack of time...

Please p-mail responses.  Most reponses to this won't be relevant to the 
list.  Thanks and sorry I can never seem to be brief!
