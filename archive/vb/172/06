Hi Volksvan12,
Definitely check and clean connection corrosion off your ground cables 
between the tranny and body and the one on the battery.  Also beware of any 
battery cables that have those repair clamps that bolt/clamp on the old ends 
of your cables.  We solder new brass clamps we get from Shuck's battery 
display onto the old cable ends with propane torch.  If you use the 
bolted/clamped on battery clamps as is you have to take them off the cables 
twice a year when you do normal battery cleaning maintenance.  
  Have you checked your voltage at the battery and what was it?
