Hi Andre,

I just went through this about a month ago while
putting new rubber seals on both tail lights.  I love
how a really fast little project turns into a 2 or 3
day project once you get started.  I checked out the
repros because I needed a whole new assembly and I was
not very satisfied with what I found.  The lens
actually looked different with a different pattern and
the assembly was almost entirely different.  I ended
up hunting down a used original assembly from a friend
that looks just like it should.  I think I spent $5
more than I would have spent on the "new" cheap
looking repro but I am much happier with the quality
of what I got.  Not that you asked for it but that is
my two cents worth.
