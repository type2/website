Subject: RE: brakes pulling to right 1 time only

Sadly, as good as we think our dubs are, they are man made. The rubber of
the brake lines decompose with age, temperature, and fluid types and
condition. I went through this exercise with my truck and asked plenty of
questions from the list, which by the way, is an awesome resource. When I
finally threw in the towel and ordered new brake lines, I was able to cut my
old ones and examine them. The rubber on the insides was swollen and in
places mushy. You'd think that they would last longer than 30 or 40 years.
Oh well! I ordered mine from Bus Boys, not top of the line braided, but
serviceable and prompt to my door in five days.

So, what makes the swell shut? I topped off the fluid,
could that be it? Does DOT3 and DOT 4 mixing do
something? Becuase I put in DOT 4 and I'm not sure
what was in there before.
