Subject: re:hot start-starter relay

i am a bit confused on this, so i will try to bypass altoghether agina now
that it is light out.

in my notes i took when dismantling the starter relay to move into the
engine compartment i noted that connection 86 was the ground.

Matt seems to agree with me,or at least it appears that way :)
he wrote:"This is probably OK.  85 should go to the "start" wire coming from
the ignition key (usually red) and 86 should be grounded.  85 and 86 are the
coil."

yet at the site http://www.oldvolkshome.com/hardstart.pdf

the diagram shows 85 as the ground.

more questions on this-
just trying to determine where the problem is...if a starter goes bad does
that mean it will never work-or may work intermittently?, same question for
solenoid.

if you push start the bus does the starter or solenoid need to be working? i
don't fully comprehend how the whole push start thing works-just that it did
yesterday.

my battery reads 6.1 with no load, i think it read something like 6.25
before i did all this work. perhaps sitting in the basement it lost some
juice.

i read at http://www.oldvolkshome.com/hardstart.pdf that the solenoid should
be lubricated, maybe mine is dry inside-would that cause these starting
problems?

again thanks for heloing get it stared last night-i think i somewhat
properly cured the paint, although i didn't let the bus run for a full
hour-due to the rattling noise making me nervous.
