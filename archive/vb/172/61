Subject: Re: [VB] lines "swelling?" brake fluid types

They just lose there elasticity and after years of swelling and heat and
cold they lose their stuff.  I don't think I would want to mix brake fluid
type though.  No reason that I know of just can't be good otherwise there
would be only one type of brake fluid.   I am  a mailman so look to some one
else to explain why!!
