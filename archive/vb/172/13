Subject: re:starter relay

can i get the dumb move award of the week....This morning i checked over the
starter area, and the wires, rewired as original(w/out relay)still got
nothing.

then i was thinking maybe i hooked the solenoid up wrong, i took the
starter/solenoid out to look at it. i guess when i took the solenoid out to
clean the contacts(while engine was out)i put it back in incorrectly. the
little tab that sticks out of the solenoid has a slot in it. this slot is
supposed to go around an arm located in the starter. as i was attaching the
solenoid from within the engien compartment-i didn't see this.

anyway i straightened out the solenoid to starter connection. now i get at
least a whir our of the starter when i turn the key. although it doesn't
really sound like the engine is actually turning over.

could i have done some permanent damage to the starter by sticking the
solenoid in incorrectly??

sorry to be bombarding you all with questions...but you guys enjoy it right?
