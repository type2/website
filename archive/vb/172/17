  The only reference I can find to the PDSI solex are on BMW, Mercedes and
Opel in my Solex master catalog. There are no references to a 32/34 on any
Solex, 32/35, 34/36 etc. Please verify the numbers. My catalog goes back
till the 50's

I found two Solex H-32/34 PDSI-3 Carbuerators on my hot rod 66 Splittie
and I'm not having much luck finding carbuerator kits for them.
The only web/internet reference reference ties them to a Citroen
........... Oh! Good Grief Charlie Brown!
Please help me find these kits before I go buy Xacto knife blades and
gasket materials.
My eyesight is poor and I'm clumsy. 
This van may never run again.
