Craig and Dave,
In my 27 years building these engines I've had only one new case that had
cam journals out of line, by .007". That was a mystery to me and I had tried
the famous experiment of getting some nice part store to "loan" me every cam
from -5 to +5 to see where it was exactly. Didn't matter what cam I used. I
set it aside for a couple months and built other engines. When I came back
to this case it was still the same. I finally got mad and went to the shop
and had them punch the ends out on the case and align bore the cam bore. The
rear was welded back up and machined off on the mating surface which cost me
$150. When you looked at the cam journals afterwards you could see just a
hint of metal taken off of the outside of each journal. I wouldn't do it
again unless it was an emergency, but it proved the point. I ended up with a
+4 cam in that engine, but had so much into it I put it into my 69 bug.

Centerlines of bearing bores for a start.
What is the history of this case?
