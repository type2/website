Aloha,

Did all the breaks, Shoes, cylinders , steal lines the works. Stopping
is GOOD! Not stopping...BAD!

Next project is the electrical... ALL of it.

Will I run into problems rewiring a 12volt convert with a '65 harness or
should I get something along the lines of a '67 harness ???

Mahalo and have a weekend,
Aloha,
Doug,
'65 Kombi
