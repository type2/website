It's normal for them to slow down a little when the system voltage is
lower with the headlights on.  Do they speed back up if you rev up the
engine a bit?

Normally I would say to check your grounds but it sounds like you have
already done that.  Are you sure you have the bulbs in the right way
around?  There is a "bright" and a "dim" filament and it is possible
to install them backwards - the bulbs are keyed but some sockets make
it easy to install them the wrong way.  The bright filament is nominally
7 times as bright as the dim filament, so you should notice quite a
difference between dim and dim+bright when the bulbs are installed
correctly.

Possibly normal at idle.  If it goes out when you rev the engine a little
then it's probably OK.
