again, this should be done already... new c/w 69mm from dpr, 
handpicked by ronnie.

cam stick is from schneider.

its possible that the crank shop here in town screwed the crank up 
when they fooled with it today, but it'd be a stretch.

i'm still going for operator error in the checking procedure (ie, i'm 
doing sumpin wrong), but what?
