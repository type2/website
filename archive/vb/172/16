Subject: roof rack mounts

I haven't been able to locate the mounts for the roof
rack on my 67 Westy.  The PO welded the rack to the
roof channel.  I have seen a couple different clamps. 
One is the two fingers that come down on each side of
the rack posts where it rests on the roof channel.  It
bolts up thru the existing bracket welded to the post.
 The other kind looks more home made and is secured at
the rack posts with another tube section welded to the
post and like a foot that comes down thur the tube and
catches under the channel.  I would like to get the
original kind.  Any sources out there?  Thanks.
