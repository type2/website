Yes, it is a B case and I'm not going to change it for now. Motor runs very nice.

| 40miles if it's dirty already) until it stays clean.

and that's next on my list.

| substitute) and also hook up the fresh air tubes, it does have heater boxes.

heater boxes are in so all I need is a hook-up for fresh air tubes....

| I'd also replac ethe fuel line, and make sure it doesn't lean on the preheat

fuel line will need some work but I might keep the filter or just simply replace it with something
else... is there something wrong with these filters? anyone had any problems? I know Ronnie has been
working on this engine so I might want to see what he's got to say about it.
