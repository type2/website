Subject: RE: [VB] exhaust 'size' question

I like the openness of the bug exhaust, but I resist cutting my back apron.
It is better to just get a header and QP muffler if I really need the open
exhaust and leave my poor truck metal alone!

Something I did to help my 'stock' setup breath easier, was I put a bug
muffler on my bus, and put two bus tailpipes on it.  I had to notch the rear
apron up about a quarter inch to clear the right side pipe, and use a later
bus exhaust tip for that side as well.

One thing I found was, that the bus tailpipes are smaller than peashooters
are, so I ended up welding them in place (because donut clamps will not hold
them on), and making my own bracket to support the right side pipe.  Pretty
easy stuff if to do with strap steel.  The sound is the same as stock bus
exhaust, but I have two pipes instead of one.  Plus, the ground clearance
ROCKS!  :-)

I also ended up pointing the exhaust pipes down (after they come out of the
little glasspacks), and cutting them almost even with the bumper so you
can't see my exhuast pipes at all.  Over time, i'm sure my back bumper will
get a little blackened by the exhuast, but hey, my bumpers need to be
repainted again anyway. lol
