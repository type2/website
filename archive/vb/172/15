Subject: I just love surprises

I found two Solex H-32/34 PDSI-3 Carbuerators on my hot rod 66 Splittie
and I'm not having much luck finding carbuerator kits for them.
The only web/internet reference reference ties them to a Citroen
........... Oh! Good Grief Charlie Brown!
Please help me find these kits before I go buy Xacto knife blades and
gasket materials.
My eyesight is poor and I'm clumsy. 
This van may never run again.
