never anything wrong with looking at generator output.  however, when you say 
you cleaned all the connections, did you clean the fuse box connections?   I 
would disconnect the ground strap from battery and just unscrew the wires 
from fuse box one at a time, clean the ends of the screws and wires with fine 
sandpaer, apply dielectric grease, and reconnect. (your 60 is screw terminal, 
ya?) is it the 8 fuse fusebox or the 6 fuse fusebox?

Remove the headlights bodily from teh bus, and examine all connections 
between headlight and bus.  I did this to my 53, and the headlights got way 
brighter, even though they still don't get the full 6.5 or whatever V the 
generator puts out.   

clean connections at dimmer switch on floor.

the turn signal slowing down means it gets less voltage.  you still have an 
unclean electric path somewhere- evidently in the headlight circuit.

my 
 front lights.  The turn signals cycle on and off quickly without the front 
 lights on, and go rather slow when the front lights are on.   Also, when the 
 rear running lights are on and the turn signals are activated, it is 
 difficult to see the lights flash.  They do but its real faint.   When I 
 activate my front lights and the turnsignals, my generator light begins to 
 glow. 
 
 Any clues?  Do I need to start and look at voltage outputs at the battery 
and 
 generator??
