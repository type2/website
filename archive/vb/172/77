I never found the kits for Solex H-32/34 PDSI-3 Electric Choke
Carburetors. 
I bought gasket material, 1/64", 1/8" fuel proof FelPro bulk sheet.
I bought several sizes of hollow brass tube and made hollow drills to cut
the small tight tolerance holes.
Some holes would have been too big to use the standard rotating leather
punch plier which I don't have.
I concerned myself only with the internal dimensions and the size and
location of the various different sized holes of the gaskets and trimmed
the excess off the outside and out of the carburetor throat with an xacto
knife after everything was bolted up tight read to install.
I robbed two 34 PICT-3 kits for the accelerator pumps, needle and seats.
That is about all that I could use from the kits.
It took less than an hour to buy and cut the gaskets and over three hours
on the Internet looking for the kits.
Certainly was one of those days that you blink and you've missed it.
I'd still like to find the kits but I put the carbs back on and the van
runs great right now.
Just need to have some daylight and I'll sink the carbs. 
There is a thin profile lock nut that was missing off each Carb but I can
saw / grind a regular nut to the right thickness and lock the factory set
main jet.
