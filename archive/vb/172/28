Subject: photos of VWs old or new

Hi all,

This is kind of a different request and look, it's
even on a Friday.  I run a t-shirt shop and I am
always looking for ways to merge my love of VW's with
my daily grind.  Anyway, my question is this... Do you
have any photographs of Volkswagens that you think
would look cool on a t-shirt?  I know that we have to
be careful here, it would have to be a picture that
you own, meaning it can't be clipped out of Hot VWs or
some book.  (I don't want to be chased down by
somebody's lawyer.) If you have a pic of your "baby"
that you have always thought would look cool on a
shirt please send it to me.  If I end up using the
photograph as part of a design to print on shirts I
will give you a few of the shirts free.  The other
thing that is important is that the photograph be
pretty good quality, if you know what 200 dpi
resolution minimum is then great, if not just send
what you have and we'll figure it out after if your
photo looks like a good candidate.  Please send photos
digitally in a .tif or .jpg format to gtilby(-at-)qwest.net
or you can mail a copy to
