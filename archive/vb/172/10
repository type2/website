Subject: Front beam needle bearings

I have picked up a beam to restore that is in very good condition.  It came
complete with trailing arm etc.  Is it worth replacing the needle bearings
in the beam?  If so is there a tool that makes the bearing easy to replace?
I have looked in the Bentley manual and do not understand the removal
process described or have the tools.  I am not sure what they are hitting
with the hammer - surely that will just push it further into the beam?
Any ideas or should I just leave them?
