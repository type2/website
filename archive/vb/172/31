Subject: RE: rattle

yes the rattle is no longer there. but i am still unable to start the
bus-except via a hill. i tried putting it in 2nd gear, and turning the
key-the bus doesn't move. i just changed out the solenoid with a known good
one(well it was good when i got it)
let me see if i undrstand how the solenoid/starter thing is supposed to
work. the charge come fromt he battery into the solenoid & starter at the
same time. the solenoid plunger pulls into it's shell(like a turtle
hiding)which throws the arm forward(FIF) which in turn shoves the gear on
the end of the starter back, and since the starter is getting juice at the
same time-this gear is spinning crazily-it hits the flywheel, and starts the
flywheel going which gets the engine started.

so the whirring noise i hear is probably the starter spinning, it is just
that the solenoid is not pushing the starter gear(which i guess is called
the bendix) into the flywheel. if the solenoid were the only thing working,
all i would hear would be the click of the solenoid kicking in.

Convert your Bus to electric drive.  In other words, put it in gear and
step off the clutch when you turn the key.  If the starter is turning
the engine your Bus will move.
