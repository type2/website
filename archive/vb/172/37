Subject: Re: [VB] My pics are up - engine Q's

| just un plug the fresh air outlets from the fan shroud, get a couple of those
| metal thingys that mush into the stock muffler (most VWers have a pile
| around, I'd give you a pair) that the bottom off the fresh air tubes slip
| over, and install the fresh air hoses.  or if it has a header make sure the
| fresh air tubes are bent (under the rear tin) in a way so they dont touch on
| the header or they will burn through.
---------------------------snip--->
I will but first I need to find that piece of tin cause the one that's there doesn't have
openings...

| I noticed your coil was at a funny angle- is there a ripped out hole where
| the threaded bits for the coil hold on bolts go?
-----------------------------snip again--->

I'll look into that, thanks.

| some folks don't like glass in case they break.  In any case I prefer the
| filter between pump and carb, so gas doesn't pour out when I replace filter.
|  And I use enough line so the filter/line goes to the left of teh coil, use a
| zip tie to hang it off the roof of the engine compartment or the triangle
| bracket if there is one.
------------------------------snip again--->

gas line will be taken apart and rerouted... filter? I'm working on it.

| I replaced a broken corner window in my 61 (later 61... has low hinge doors)
| after I putting it off for about 4 years .
----------------------------yet snip once more--->

one of the corner windows on mine is cracked a bit... little tiny crack at the bottom. Problem is
once I need to replace it first I'll have to tint it since all the side windows have been tinted. PO
was a proffesional at this.

thanks,
