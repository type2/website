Subject: brakes pulling to right 1 time only

Hey all, 

My brakes pull to the right pretty hard when I step on
them for the first time while driving, but after that
they don't seem to pull to the right at all or, maybe
very little, but nothing like the first time.

I recently replaced everything (EVERYTHING) on the
back brakes and bled the system, but I couldn't bleed
the fronts because the nipples were frozen. The front
shoes looked good, so I just adjusted them.

What next?
