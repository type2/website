Hi Kevin,
First in a stock bus wiring there is no fusing of the electrical flow to the 
coil or the solinoid!  So either you have a short in the wiring to the 
solinoid or the fuses are not big enough for the draw.
 As for the rattle it could be soooo many things, engine, tranny, suspension, 
even loose shift rod bolts.
