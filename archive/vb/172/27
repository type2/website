Subject: Re: [VB] 205 distr vac fix

I picked up one of the vacuum cans for the 205 distributors today from 
Autozone, the Wells RV1001 $17 part.  It drops in and fits perfectly.  
This is a german made Bosch part.  It has the Bosch emblem stamped on 
the can.  I was really pissed when the vacuum advance on this 
distributor failed last year as it is a great distributor.  I did not 
expect to find a replacement vacuum advance can at all, especially a not 
a new one for less than $20!    Gary Gibson
