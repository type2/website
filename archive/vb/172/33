 heater boxes are in so all I need is a hook-up for fresh air tubes....
 --------------------------
just un plug the fresh air outlets from the fan shroud, get a couple of those 
metal thingys that mush into the stock muffler (most VWers have a pile 
around, I'd give you a pair) that the bottom off the fresh air tubes slip 
over, and install the fresh air hoses.  or if it has a header make sure the 
fresh air tubes are bent (under the rear tin) in a way so they dont touch on 
the header or they will burn through.   

I noticed your coil was at a funny angle- is there a ripped out hole where 
the threaded bits for the coil hold on bolts go?

 fuel line will need some work but I might keep the filter or just simply 
replace it with something else... is there something wrong with these 
filters? anyone had any problems? I know Ronnie has been working on this 
engine so I might want to see what he's got to say about it.
 ------------------------
some folks don't like glass in case they break.  In any case I prefer the 
filter between pump and carb, so gas doesn't pour out when I replace filter.  
 And I use enough line so the filter/line goes to the left of teh coil, use a 
zip tie to hang it off the roof of the engine compartment or the triangle 
bracket if there is one.

 very stylee..... I love mine!-
--------------------
I replaced a broken corner window in my 61 (later 61... has low hinge doors) 
after I putting it off for about 4 years .   It had a chip when I bought  the 
bus and driving down a bad road to get to a gorgeous glacial lake in Montana 
cracked the glass. oh well.  Anyway, it was easier than I expected, even used 
sigla glass!  the tricky part was getting the seal onto the glass, I had to 
use string to hold it as it really wanted to slip off as the glass is curved. 
  use lots of lube when installing.   Bus looks happier with nice glass and 
new seal.  :)
