I had this same problem with my gate screws, what was left of them. There
were several missing and a few backed part way out and rusted there. I
squirted them down liberally with penetrant and heated them up with a
propane torch a couple of days later. I wasn't worry about the rattle can
paint that might get damages, hah, and the whacked them good several times
with an impact driver that had a good sharp bit. Those threads get rusted
real good, or is that real bad?
