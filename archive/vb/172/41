Hi Kevin,
Probably not!  We are betting that the starter gear is getting pushed, but 
the gear is ground/smeared to heck and back out of existance.  Also the FW 
gear will be damaged.  This will require you to remove the engine, remove the 
starter.  Then either replace the FW or hand file each tooth of the ring gear 
so as to allow it to function properly.  We helped a friend do this and it 
only took her about two hours of filing.  All due to bad dash wiring shorting 
out!  Then replace the starter or at least have the bendix gear replaced and 
starter checked for damage.  Finally inspect and replace if needed the 
starter bushing, and install starter and engine.
