Subject: RE: [VB] camshaft gear trials

the + and - cam sizes represent a slightly bigger or smaller camshaft 
gear... tho i have ALSO heard that it is actually the >pitch< of the 
gear that varies.
i'd believe the first explanation; berg writes that even the same 
machine cutting bores on 100 cases will make slight variations in 
operation throughout the day, due to expansion due to heat, 
cumulative wear, etc. so, as dave w points out, a new, uncut case 
SHOULD be perfectly parallell and straight:  0, or STD... but not 
always.
vw made 15 different sizes, mainly to account for variations in 
machine work done after the initial purchase.
