I say don't take no for an answer.  I use to pick antique furniture for
years - I actually acquired some amazing stuff.  It's my experience that
when you ask someone if something is for sale and they say no if you  then
offer them a fair price or a price higher then they think it is worth - 9
times out of 10 you'll get the item.
