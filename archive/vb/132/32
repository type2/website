Subject: Kymco Manifold

Has anyone tried fitting Kymco's "Johnny 4-Play" manifold to a bus. It allows 
the use of a standard Holley 4bbl. We've had great results with some homemade 
manifolds and Holley's on sandrails and sedans, but I'm not sure if this 
manifold/carbeurator will fit in to a bus compartment.
