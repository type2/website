Thats sounds great!  Let me know if it works.  I have the interior out of my 
sundial now (CAN YOU SAY LOUD) and was thinking about doing that too.  The 
original felt doesn't work that well and dynomat i$ expensive.  Have brought 
this up on the list before and heard lots fo suggestions, like tar paper and 
such.
