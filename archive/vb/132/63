  Happy Friday!
  This Sunday the Discovery channel will be replaying 4 
episodes of "Monster Garage". My favorite is the one 
where they transform a New Beetle into a swamp boat! 
They use an aircooled T1 motor in the back with a prop 
attached to the crank pulley to push it! An aircooled, 
rear-engined new beetle, I like it!
  The other episodes are fun too:
- F*rd Explore turned into a garbage truck (Yeah!)
- Mustang 5.0 turned into a lawn mower
- Lincoln towncar limo turned into a firetruck

Episodes start at 4pm, more info here:
