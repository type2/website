Subject: 61 Deluxe Camper Saga Ends

Long time members may recall the saga of my trying to
acquire an apparently abandoned '61 Deluxe with a 
camper interior. The saga has ended on a sad note.

First a quick review. Found the bus 3 miles from home.
Empty property. Consulted real estate maps to find owner,
wrote owner, no response (not a big surprise as the real
owner of the property was Bill Cartwright, of Chicago Bulls
asst coach fame). Found phone number of bus owner from 
neighbor. Idiot gets angry and threatened if we touched 
the bus. I backed off.

Fast forward a few years. Adjacent property built on ($$$),
owner wants this property for road. Buys it, and since bus
has no tranny (only thing of value in his mind) or engine
pays someone to haul it off, along with bunch of junk.

Went to party last weekend at this hou$e and found out this
ending to the saga. The bus was pretty well rusted since
the sunroof was torn apart, and it had been in the weeds 
for years, but I never even got the chance. If he had known
I wanted the bus, coulda been a freebie.

Lesson learned: Even if rebuked by an absentee owner, leave
a note on/in the bus. Someone else may actually be the one 
to dispose of it, not the person who left it in the weeds.

Bummer. I really wanted to find out if the camper was a
Westphalia version as delivered. Too piled with stuff on 
the inside to tell at the time.

Jeff  bussless, still
any sunroof standards out there for sale?
