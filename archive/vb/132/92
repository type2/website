Subject: I stink at bondo

Yes, I have to admit it out loud.  I know the "B" word  has alot of
negative connotations, but when used, for the right purpose, it works
for me (a little dent on a nice flat surface).  I just can't get the
bottom of the Big V on the nose of my '65 to look right.  I took the
entire nose down to bare metal, and found a fair  amount of previous
filler in a few spots.  I have been able to get passable results on the
other areas by myself,  but the bottom section of the V is killing me.
The myriad of small dents from the previous fix I found after grinding
out all the filler are not deep, but I just can't get it right.  I need
to call in some help. I guess I'll begin putting out feelers within
family and friends for some kind of "hired gun bondo artist".  Bus not
driveable, so how much do you think one of these outlaws should get for
coming out to finish this for me?  As of right now, I know of noone I
can think of to do it, so it will probably be a friend of a friend type
deal.  I hate to even consider this option, but if it took someone an
hour and a case of premium beer, I'm all for it at this point.  Once the
nose is done, bus is ready for priming.
