Subject: Jerome Jamboree raffle bus

Hi all.

Just wanted to say that thanks to Jerry & Melissa Jess and Lorenzo Pearson of 
WCM, we now have all the rubber item (except a floor mat) for our single cab 
that we will be raffleing off at Jerome Jamboree XII!  Several list members 
have made some very appreciated donations of parts.  Some other list members 
have donated cash, which Ronnie is graciously keeping track of for us to help 
cover some of the last things that do not get donated.  

A big surprise to us was a donation of a reproduction tilt for the SC by Tom 
Buese!!!  That was not even on the wish list because we never dreamed someone 
would donate something like that.  Now, if we only had a pair of hoops for 
it.  Anyone out there have an extra pair laying around????

There really is still a lot we need for the truck.  Mostly hardware items 
like door handles, latches, mirrors, and such.  Our goal is to drive it to 
the Familianfest in August.  Realistically, though, it'll most likely get 
towed there.  If anyone out there in bus land has even the smallest trinket 
on the list, and could let it go to the cause, it would be greatly 
appreciated.  You can see the list at www.arizonabusclub.com.

Last year the ABC donated over $9000 to charity from the Jerome Jamboree 
event alone!!!  Your donation to the raffle bus can earn you a little 
recognition and a lot of karma for helping a good cause.

Thanks for listening to me grovel,
