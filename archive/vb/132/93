that is why i am a little hesitant, i think i may just use some damping
material-that mcmaster carr sells. it is self adhesive, and i think
relatively easy to remove.

Something to keep in mind here is what it is VERY VERY difficult to
remove this stuff once it's been applied. Ten years from now, somebody
(you or a new owner) will be cussing long and loud about the jackass
that sprayed that stuff on there...

Thats sounds great!  Let me know if it works.  I have the interior out
of my
sundial now (CAN YOU SAY LOUD) and was thinking about doing that too.
The
original felt doesn't work that well and dynomat i$ expensive.  Have
brought
this up on the list before and heard lots fo suggestions, like tar paper
and
such.
