I agree here. I was talked into rebuilding the 1600DP engine that came with 
my '59 Kombi. I did everything myself except machining the case and 
rebuilding the heads. Had some help from list members and friends on how to 
measure (Thanks Craig K!!!) and tips on assembly and fine tuning. I took 
the bus for one last cruise before the new owner took delivery and still am 
amazed at how well the engine ran. Just as smooth as silk. Ran like a 
"Singer". No rocking back and forth or nothin'!!! Just hummed along. Local 
VW guys and mechanics always commented on how well it ran as well. 
Beginner's luck? Maybe. Regardless I did it and it worked great.

Build it yourself. You'll feel more confident about fixing just about 
everything else on the bus after you do.
