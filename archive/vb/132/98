Subject: Re: [VB] Locking Steering??

did you just get a steering lock?   
The key works in 4 positions- 
the usual 
OFF
ON (or FAHRT)
START
and LOCK- when you pull the key out of the lock the tab pops out to lock the column
when you put the key in when it is in LOCK, and turn it to OFF, the tab is retracted

of course, to make the lock work, you need a locking column.  That has a oval hole in the tube, and a collar for the lock tab to catch on welded on to the shaft.  SO when the lock tab catches the lock piece, the steering does not turn.
Unless you have a locking column, you will have to remove yours to either convert it or replace it with a locking column to make the lock work.

I have a few questions about the Locking Steering on the Splitwindows.
When installing one for the first time do you drill a hole in the Outer Shell of the Steering column?  Is the Switch suppose to be spring loaded, come back when pushing forward to engage starter?
