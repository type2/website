Subject: [VB] Kymco Manifold


Has anyone tried fitting Kymco's "Johnny 4-Play" manifold to a bus. It
allows 
the use of a standard Holley 4bbl. We've had great results with some
homemade 
manifolds and Holley's on sandrails and sedans, but I'm not sure if this 
manifold/carbeurator will fit in to a bus compartment.

Jerry,
Had clearance problems with top of carb and air filter screw. In fact,
unable to put on any kind of filter even after wrestling the carb in. Works
OK clearance wise in a bug or a thing. Only tried with a 200 and 300 cfm
carb, some others on the market are more low profile, provided you can adapt
linkage on the correct side, but still believe you can't get an air filter
on.
