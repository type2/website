Subject: '59 SC...Rhino Lining

Anyone out there had the bed of their truck done with Rhino Liner? 
I'm not gonna be going stock, so considering it as an option.

Also considering making panels for the inside of the gates. Can't 
figure out why they didn't have something in the first place. Just 
like inside a bus, it would keep them from getting dinged from the 
inside out. Thinking about making some panels out of sheet metal.
