Subject: Re: [VB] VDO Oil Pressure sender

There are two VDO pressure senders, a two and a one 
terminal. The two terminal sender has an on/off 
connection and an analog for the guage. Nope, you can't 
hook the idiot light to the guage. Get the correct type 
if you want the idiot light to work. I recommend it.
