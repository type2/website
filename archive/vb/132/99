Don,

As Dirty Harry once said...

"A man's just *got* to know his limitations"  <grin>

I just plain suck at body work....can do just about everything else in the 
world, but just don't have what it takes for the body.

I figure that it is a lack of knowing/watching a professional
at work.  There *must* be a secret to it and I don't know what it is!

Cheers, dave
