I hope at the same time he's cussing the same Jackass (me) for taking a 
basket case bus and putting it back on the road.

I personally could give a rat's ass what some new owner thinks about what 
I've done to my bus. If they don't like it they don't have to buy it. It's 
mine right now and IF I choose to Rhino Liner the bed....so be it.

I'm not here to serve others opinions of how what is the "correct" way to 
make my truck a functional vehicle again. That's why I prefaced the 
question with the fact that it won't be a stock restoration.

I'm pretty sure everyone knows that if you don't do something stock that 
there are people that won't agree. Do we have to go through this every 
single time someone on this list asks a question that doesn't fit other's 
opinion of a stock job?

Maybe an over-reaction on my part....but being called a jackass doesn't sit 
well with me.
