Subject: RE: [VB] re:rhino liner

  I used rhino liner (a product self applied) to the underside of a
customers 21 window deluxe after I did all the rust repair. He surfs a lot
and lives near the beach and I was looking for the best product to seal and
insulate the underside of his bus and came up with bed liner. It has a rust
inhibitor in it, is still pliable, is tough as can be and really dropped the
noise level in the bus. 
  Back when I was restoring Porsches we used Wurth body shutz on the
underneath of Porsches (same as the factory, when we did the rust repair we
found it all to be where it wasn't undercoated or where water had got in
behind the seams and rusted from the inside out or where the body shutz had
peeled off. 
  Bed liner is just a modern equivalent of old school undercoating marketed
in a different way.

ps, after 4 years the 21 window is still perfect on the underside.

That's what the guy said when he cut the wheel wells and the cab divider
back in '72.  I think Rhino liner would be great on the underside of a
bus...  

Now where in the hell did I put my sawsall???  ;-)
