Subject: RE: [VB] Clear Speedo needles.  What year did that end?

If I remember correctly, there was a period of time during 1960 where
they had an 80mph speedo w/the clear needle. What month was your bus
produced? Corona Ryan is the guy to ask, as I'm no expert...

Anyone know what year VW switched to the white speedo needle?

I have a 1961 DC that did not come with the original speedo.  I know my
60 DC had a 70mph speedo with clear needle.  What would a 1961 US
delivered bus have?

Thanks, Matthew
