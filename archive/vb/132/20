Well after sitting in my bus for months they are finally on and look awesome, 
but heres a few tips for future purchasers of the set up.  First make sure 
your front drums will accept the rim, if not grab a grinder and grind away it 
works just fine and is alot cheaper than the sales persons alternative,,,
 I bought the polished 5 spokes from the real source.  They are the eagle 
mags.  I also ordered the lug bolts i thought would be necessary to complete 
the job.  First set they sent were for a bug, so no go.  Ok I said simple 
mistake send the bus ones and a few weeks later they were here.   Only proble 
now is the studs are right but the lug bolts do not sink into the rim, also a 
no go.... Ended up ordering them from a supplier over here in germany and the 
20 lug bolts cost me $60 big ones cause I couldn't wait another 2 months for 
parts from the states, moral to the story is make sure you get ordered what 
you need first and then dig into the project,,,,,,and make sure the sales 
guys know what the hell they are talking about and not a lot of blah blah 
blah.  With all the bs this job ending up costing me 800 dollars and should 
of only been around 600 with shipping and all, no thanks to uneducated sales 
people.....not all of them are but there are quite a few out there...
Peace Out
