Subject: RE: [VB] Clear Speedo needles.  What year did that end?

  Anybody can just about write a tech artical for Hot VW's and/or VW trends
and they will publish it. I have called the editor at both of these and
complained that the articals are one sided (generally for the vendor that
writes them) and are full of ton's of BS and could cause more damage then
help. The answer was, "then you write one and send it in". I also asked if
they were ever checked and/or verified and again the answer was "NO", thta's
why we list who wrote it!
  Me and a couple of friends made up a complete BS artical to send in, but
haven't worked up the nerve to submit it YET!

ronnie

ps. Let me clarify "not all" articals but most of them

pps. I did do one on rebuilding the split bus front end along with the link
pins and once I do the king pins I will submit it with the pics and also
have all the pics on rebuilding RGB, setting the rear axle and end gears,
etc, that I will submit also. But I think I'll save them for Camper and
Commercial, must beter mag

Lots of mistakes too.  Doesn't anybody check facts anymore?
