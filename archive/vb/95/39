A lot of the thefts have been from driveways at night.  They make wireless
motion detectors that sound an alert inside your house when someone walks
in front of the sensor.  I've had a hardwired version of this (made from a
motion sensor light) for years and it's good for peace of mind, as well as
letting me know when my friends come into the yard.

As far as car alarms go, they seem to be universally ignored.  I don't
know how many times I've seen a car, alarm screaming, being dragged up
onto a flatbed.  The assumption is that the car is being towed for parking
violations.

Now if you had an alarm that sounded like the vocalizations of a cat
being slowly parbroiled...
