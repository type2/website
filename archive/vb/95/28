Subject: [VB] Purpose of these B-pillar holes? 

Possible securing points for the tall cabinet behind the lefthand righthand
USA/Euro configs of a SO44? Sturdy enough to secure a cabinet but not safe
enough for a  (yet to be thought of) shoulder harness seatbelt? Used by only a
few of the "Kombi" bodies but included by the factory for possible use? I'm
guessing-brainstorming.
Just a (camper obsessed) thought...

The smallish 1967-ish white plastic coat hook/knobs were sercured with a single
small selfthreading non-machine screw through a hole in the sheet metal. No
spot welded nut on the backside of that mount point. (Understood that the hole
with the spot welded nut on the backside was in a different place...)
