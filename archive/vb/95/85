All,

Just another Public Service Announcement to keep a fire extinguisher
in _all_ your vehicles.  This evening I was working on the lawn mower
in the driveway, adjusting the carb after a successful tune-up.  I
smelled something burning and I figured it was maybe some of the
solvent burning out or one of the new gaskets getting a little warm.
Nope - I looked down the street to the stop sign and an S-10 was
stopped with smoke pouring out of the front.

I grabbed the extinguisher out of my Toyota and ran down there.
There were a few people from the neighborhood there but nobody had
an extinguisher.  There were flames under the left wheel well that
I knocked down with the extinguisher, and when the kid got the hood
open I hit a couple more hot spots.  The fire department came by
and hosed it down a little to finish cooling it off and that was
that.

I know he lost part of a wiring harness, an ATF line (I could see 
the fluid leaking out under the truck), and some assorted small
rubber hoses.  But that sure beats losing a whole truck.

I keep a fairly big extinguisher just to the left of the driver's
seat in my Bus, and smaller ones under the front seats of my other
cars.  Hopefully I won't ever have to _use_ one on one of my own
cars, but it's a lot better to have one and not need it than it is
to need one and not have it.  This has been a public service
announcement.
