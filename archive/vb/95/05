who's a hack??  Last time I checked, a Behr scoop is an original VW
accessory, for barndoors i might add. What about you hacking up late NOS
ribbed bumpers just so you can be "correct" and have the right length ribs
for your 55 westy?  Im sure that doesn't count does it Hackboy, you'll
prolly deny it anyway, oh well.

I *should* hack in the walkthru, id like a barndoor walkthru anyway. Plus,
I now have a birth certificate from the official VW museum of Germany,
*hand* signed by Dr. B wiersch and Chr. Neefe, proving that it is an
original walk-thru! sweet
