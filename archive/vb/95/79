With all the talk of vintgage splitties being stolen
on the west coast, I can't think that I want to sit by
wait for mine to be next.  While I may live in
Michigan in the area best known for bike theft(college
town), I don't want to take a chance.
At $150-300 for peace of mind, it will have to wait
until my brakes are done.  For now I did buy an
Autolock.  For $50 I can lock down my brakes, so no
one can drive it away.  (kinda pointless with bad
brakes)
Since I have yet to find and buy another split, I am
at least protecting my bay window bus.  When I do you
better belive I am sinking the $$$ into a decurity
device for it... why not, I am spending the money on a
71 Westy.  I love my buses and this will keep me from
feeling too violated. (I got other crap to do that,
why add more)
To all who have lost their VW's...
 I am sorry that had to happen and I wish the best of
luck in getting them back.

my opinion for the day... if you don't want to read,
just delete.  Thanks.
-Dawn
