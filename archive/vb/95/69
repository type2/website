I have seen one go bad.  Take one of the spark plug wires off of the plug.
Put on a loose plug on that wire, then (have some good lineman pliers or
something that wont shock you to hold the plug)ground the plug on the engine
case (not the electrode, but the threaded side), and see if it sparks when
you turn the engine over.  Remember that if it is good, the engine might
just start up on 3 cylinders, so be careful.  If it sparks, it's good, if it
doesn't, then try to put in some points and a condenser, and see if it will
fire up.

Later
