Way back when they didn't charge for this I wrote to them twice witht he =
same VIN (don't ask) and got two different responses regarding the date of =
production of the van. They only differed bya  day but would seem to imply =
that the factory's records aren't flawless esp. when they contradict what =
was stamped on the m-code tag etc.

I doubt that VW expected that 40 years later vw fiends would be asking =
them to blow the dust off their old record books and dig up this info.
