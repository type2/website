Well If they can figure out how to get mine started with all the damn toggle
switches I have hooked up on the dash , along with push buttons. And you
still need the key to unlock the steering wheel :) I guess they can have it
:)

I prefer an ignitor set in the fuel tank at the vapor line and hooked to the

(better figure out a way to disable it before I get in, huh?)

So how exactly does one go about "parbroiling" a cat?

Now if you had an alarm that sounded like the vocalizations of a cat
being slowly parbroiled...
