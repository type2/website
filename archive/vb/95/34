How do you release it?  I'm sure the bad guys know the answer to this
already.

This lock also be defeated by a conventional tow truck and a tow dolly,
or a flatbed tow truck with a good winch.  A good winch can skid the
target vehicle, even with locked-up wheels, up on to the tow truck --
I have seen this done with wrecked cars.  The bad guys could also cut
the brake lines and cables to free up the wheels and then use a
conventional tow truck with no dolly.  They'd have to fix the lines
later but lines are cheap. 

I realize that the point of a lot of security devices is "make this
car harder to steal than some other car" and not "make this car
unstealable".  But I think it's good to think about how different 
security devices could be defeated before installing them on your
Bus.
