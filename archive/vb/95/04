Subject: Stolen Bug!!!! why not take the bus?

63 blue sliding ragtop (with blue rims) stolen this morning (3/21/02) from
a Mesa Arizona residence driveway. They took the bug instead of the freshly
restored 1960 15 window sitting beside it. Americas dumbest criminals. See
the link below for pics and more info
