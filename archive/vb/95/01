FWIW, from the "Old Cars Price Guide", here are ballpark values for a
1960 Type 2 camper:

1--trailer queen, never driven:  $24500
2--excellent original or superior resto:  $14300
3--good amateur resto, presentable & serviceable:  $8200
4--deteriorated resto, but driveable:  $4100
5--needs complete resto, but not wrecked:  $2450
6--parts car:  $800
