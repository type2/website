Hi Michael,
Sounds like a cop out to us!  The 1967 thru 79 buses had the shoulder points 
and there is not that much differance between them in this particular body 
area.  More than likely they just do not carry them due to the proliferance 
of dead 1968 on thru vanagon buses which have shoulder belts availible 
inexpensively out of wrecking yards.   Eric&Barb
