Exactly, my point was that it would be easy to overlook the buildup in the
alternator/generator when cleaning the engine since you cant get a really
good view unless you remove the tin.

I believe the tin piece that goes on the front of the alternator
(and later generators) is designed to route some of the air from
the fan shroud through the alternator to cool it.  So if there's
oil in the cooling air, some of it will make it through the
alternator.
