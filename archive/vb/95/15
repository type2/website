Subject: Purpose of these B-pillar holes?

In my 67 DC, just underneath each coat hook on the B-pillar, there is a
round hole with an opaque plastic plug in it.  Big enough to stick a
finger in and feel around.  Removing the plug, there is nothing but the
bare inside of the B-pillar--no screw heads, nuts, nut plates, wiring,
etc..  Anyone know why VW would put these holes in a DC, then plug them
up this way?  Access to B-pillar for....??  Installation hole for....??

Just wondering.
