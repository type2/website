Subject: front floor panel

Howdy all,

I have a '59 panel in need of an entire front floor
panel.  What I'm wondering is what years would have
the appropriate floor design to fit properly in my
'59?  I see a few of the '66-67 type, but not much
earlier.  Anyone have any NOS panels, or know of
current manufacturers of complete floor sections?

I read in the archive from last year a post of
Ronnie's of Old Volks Gen. about a guy making new
panels?  Did this come through, and/or any available?

Any info appreciated,

Thanks

Blake
