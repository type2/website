Subject: Ellis whips it out in public...

For once, the Ellis family will be attending a VW Event! Whoo hoo!
(good news - bad news depending on where you stand...) ;-0 

Am encouraging everyone to join us and the rest of the Arizona Bus Club (and
friends) at the annual Corona de Tucson campout. $10. per vehicle per night
(Friday and Saturday). We will meet up on Saturday at the break of mid-day.
Hope to drag a few hippies from Albuquerque and tag along cowboy family from
SanDiego. Check thesamba.com for SHOWS details.

See you there! =)
-Jim Ellis
