What kind of paint? Single stage or base/clear?

Glasurit was the OEM supplier for VW in the 60's (don't know about later).
Glasurit will probably be closer to the original color. Regardless of who
you get the paint from, whether you get the right color depends on the
expertise of the person that mixes the paint for you.

PPG, Dupont and Sherwin-Williams can all mix VW colors. I use
Sherwin-Williams.
