Steve, this will be the second summer for me pulling a Scamp.  I love
pulling that trailer so much that I am building a '63 DC with an upright
type 4 just to pull it.  The DC and Scamp will have matching paint, tilt,
curtains and awning as well.

Camping in the Scamp is a blast, you don't have to take all the camping junk
with you in your bus and you can unhook and drive away in minutes, not
having to "break camp".  Plus, I get to travel and camp with a double cab!

I have picked up 3 of the Scamps and will be selling 2 of them.  When you
buy an old Scamp, you will need to replace the axle, they are a torsion unit
and sag with age.

The Scamp I use has hot and cold running water, a forced air furnace, air
conditioning, stove, 'fridge, 12volt and 120volt lighting, awning and sleeps
two adults and two kids very nicely.

A standard VW bus will pull the Scamps (tough on hills though), but I am
looking forward to the type 4 power and hydraulic lifters to make the trips
that much more enjoyable.  Before everything is done, the DC will also have
a gasoline heater and air conditioning.  Call me a softy, but the way I look
at it is: if everyone enjoys the trip more, there will be more trips!!!
