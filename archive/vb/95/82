Subject: Split Bus Seats on eBay

Thanks to all of the list members who pointed out the true nature of the 
middle seat formerly in my '66 Samba.  It is apparently not the coveted 
splitty middle seat, but rather a bay-window seat posing as its better 
cousin.  I honesty didn't know this (after all, it did *come out* of my 
'66).

I have adjusted my description and pricing accordingly.  Thanks again for 
your advice and expertise!

The auction continues . . .

Richard
