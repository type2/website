 I have a '59 panel in need of an entire front floor
 panel.  What I'm wondering is what years would have
 the appropriate floor design to fit properly in my
 '59?  I see a few of the '66-67 type, but not much
 earlier.  Anyone have any NOS panels, or know of
 current manufacturers of complete floor sections? >>

you can get the corners from WW.  I dunno who make whole front floors if 
anyone does.  you may need a custom fab job.   The shift stick is further 
back on a 59- think they changed than in nov 60 to the further forward 
position- you may find it best to find a original front floor for themiddle 
area.
