Thanks Matt,

I paid a visit to Rancho and asked them the same questions that I asked 
the list. They stated that the 3.88 r&p do not have the "r" number on 
the pinion gear (same as you mentioned). They told me the "normal" size 
of shims for the gear combination that I am using. I then used Prussian 
Blue to visually check the gears for proper mesh. I have not finished 
the job yet. The pinion shim is right on but I need to put in a thicker 
gear side differential shim.

There is so much to learn when the desire is to do things right.

Thanks for the tip on the online doc project.

Rocky
