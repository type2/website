Subject: Re: [VB] Re: engine miss at high rpm

I recently got a 66 Bus.
I've had the dickens getting it to idle down and accelerate smoothly.
It really turns on good at about 2500 rpms but tends to be jerky while
trying to maintain 35 mph in third or forth gear.
I replaced the delco coil with a Bosch Blue (van was converted to 12 v).
The 009 cap and rotor are the same as on my 83 Westy Air Cooled (New cap,
rotor, point set ordered)
Already installed new wire set because the old wire set was shocking me
when I touched any of the wires.(the wires on my 83 don't shock me if I
touch them).
I get some popping back through the dual carbs 34 PICT3 and have reduced
it considerably but I'm thinking that this van was last registered in
1993 so its my assumption that the surge pumps and other Carb parts might
need replaced. (Kits ordered) I notice that the surge pumps appear to
activate slowly (hard diaphragms , I guess).
I found really great Carb Rebuilding information in the Tech section of
Type 2.

 > I would generally associate a miss, especially at high speeds, with 
 ignition rather than carburetion.  At idle, the ignition system has
a long time between plug firings to build up enough voltage to  work.
This is a pretty forgiving environment, so even marginal parts will work
OK.  As you rev up the engine, the ignition has less and less time to
produce a spark, and can start failing on you.
