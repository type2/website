Subject: RE: [VB] Transport companies

You should have received a firm to very close to firm ship date. It is
absurd to pay more, and absurd they charge you 200 when they fail to do
their job. I'd be stern about getting a pickup date and shipper assign
in no more than 2 weeks, at your current inverstment, which hopefully
wasn't the full amount already.
I hate shipping anything, these companies act like its a favor instead
of a 1000.00 business deal.
Good luck, I feel your pain.
Al 66 dlx, shipped from OR to PA for 1200.00, and had shipper fail to
pick it up 3 nights ina  row, plus arrive in the dead of night, after
getting lost in NJ!


Question is if anyone has dealt with Southerland Auto Transport, Inc.
from Anderson, CA in the past?

It's been six weeks since I placed order to ship my Bus and as of today
no carrier has been assigned. I have been extremely patient so far and
very polite but today they gave me an earful when I called to check on
the status of my order. I have an option to cancel and loose $200.00 or
pay extra $200.00 to speed-up the order. Is this some kind of a scam? It
seems to me that my order will be sitting on the bottom shelf until I
come-up with the extra money...
