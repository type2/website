I have the same on my '71.  Hooks for the seatback, undo clamps
underneath, whole seat base levers up makes a sort of bed with the rear
deck.

I've never used it because I installed armrests in the back seat and these
interefere with the folding bit.  My rear deck is always too cluttered to
sleep on anyway.  When travelling, the middle seat stays home and I sleep
on the floor of the bus, legs between the front seats.

My feeling is that it is an aftermarket item, probably dealer installed.
