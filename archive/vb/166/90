Well, since this is where the end play is, I'd expect that wear here would
result in too much end play!  :)

If the shim is worn, and replacement of the shim brings things back into
spec, it this would be the ideal solution!

However, is the shim really worn, or just distorted "dished" by pressure
between the flywheel and the thrust bearing?  I've seen this when the thin
shim is placed next to the thrust bearing.  Since then, I've assembled the
thickest shim against the thrust bearing and the thinnest shim in the
middle of the stack.
