I think it was your comments that encouraged me to definately get one - I
first saw it on a bus in the UK earlier in the year and thought I want I
want!

I have left it a bit late to order this now - what does the kit include?  
I am sure on the type2 tech pages someone had done it themselves - anyone
done this instead (don't have web access only email on my laptop)?  I am not
too bothered about the brakelines not fitting as I was intending on
replacing these as they look to be original.

So is this what you are currently running then?

My plans were also to go for rear brakes as well, but with IRS not RGBs.
Have you offered up the MC to see if it fits yet?  Will the resivoir line up
with the hole in the floor?

Thanks a lot
