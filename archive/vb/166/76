  If I remember right you will have to split the trans and remove the axles
and carrier together, There is a set pin that keeps the inner axle tension
nut from coming loose. They are a real PITA to work on, thus the high prices
from the people that do, I have be quoted from trans shops that will even
touch anywhere from 400 to 700 dollars LABOR ONLY.

Hi All,

Got a good splitcase tranny for my barney and I've
just apent a coupla hours pulling the reduction boxes
('later'  57 splitcase with small nut reduction boxes) off it.

There's no circlips holding the axles in?  There seems to be
a collar instead?

Can someone give me a tip on how to get the axles out?
(I'd guess this collar has to be extracted - but how?  Not
much room in there for a tool......)

Thanks

RobK
