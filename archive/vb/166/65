Subject: HVWC Night Show cruise

For those who are interested, there will a cruise to the show leaving from Maui Bros Pizza on Beltway 8 (-at-) West rd. The pizza is excellent and I don't think there will be a food vendor at the show. So don't go hungry! For more info go to www.aircoolers.org 



Thanks,
