Subject: Friday fun: ID the mystery part

Hey Volks

Here are a couple of pics of a mystery part from one of the
splitties in my scrapyard.

Any guesses what this part is and what it does, before I
post more pics identifying it?

The only clue I'll give is that it can be found on a South
African single cab split.

No prizes for correct answers, other than a place in the
Vintage Bus Minutiae Hall of Fame.
