Hey, Andre -

I went out to visit southerland Auto Transport today. It is a travel trailer 
parked behind a double wide. The proprieter would not give me his name and 
for me to describe his manner as abrupt would be kind. His bottom line was 
"There is a civil contract I have not violated - cash has priority!" With 
that, he was done talking to me. I would grade him poorly in customer service 
. . .

Translation: He is following the letter of the law (civil) and has committed 
no defined crime. He does not treat his fellow brother very well and only 
follows the dollar. Either way, it looks like he is into you for $200 more 
than you had hoped. The only way for you to make him give you the money back 
would be in a long and counterproductive civil lawsuit - it would cost you 
more to get it that the $200. 

Bad business ethic usually has a way of finding it's own karma.

Andre - best of luck, my friend -
