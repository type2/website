Hi Andre,
Hate to say it . . .but it looks like you should pay the $200 extra, and
write it off to experience.  If the guy you bought the bus from needs to get
it off his property - you don't really have a choice.

Also sounds like you'll spend more than the extra $200 in phone calls, lost
time at work, worry, etc, etc, etc.

You don't really have much of a choice.

Just my opinion . . .
Ed
