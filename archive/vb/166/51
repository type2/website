Yep.  They (our government-monopoly insureance company) are saying the
damage is worth about $1500.  The roof is pretty seriously damaged.  A
horrible, terrible no good really bad day.  And unless I can prove the door
is faulty it would go under my collision insurance.
Which means my insurance would go up by about $400 a year, so it's not even
worth it.  Plus they're not convinced the bus is even worth that much...
