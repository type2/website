Subject: Theft on Tucson

    This might be little but a customer of mine just had his SAFARIS stolen
out of his bus, in his driveway in Tucson. I know there are people in Tucson
on this list so I am asking them to keep there eyes peeled for a freshly
painted (by the thief's I'm sure) set of Bus Boys (same as Wolfgang)
safaris, or a bus with a newly installed set. 
    I have put the word out to everyone in Tucson I know and am passing this
on. There is a show at Chirco on the 5th of October so keep your eye's
peeled for any for sale at the swap meet or a newly installed used, freshly
painted set
  Please e-mail me or call and I will send you the victims addy and phone
