Didn't even think about that.  How small is it then?  Oldspeed are trying to
use this Golf/Jetta mc with a beetle with 944 brakes - so I would assume it
probably is a bit small for this application.
It would probably be good for my friend though (I help him with mechanical
bit he helps me with paint and body stuff).  
What is needed to fit this to the bus?

Thanks
