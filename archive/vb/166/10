Subject: Dual circuit master cylinders

To go with my new OldSpeed 944 front brake conversion I want to fit a dual
circuit master cylinder to my 66 bus.
OldSpeed at the moment would use a 67 only m/c modified to remove the
residual pressure valve, but are working on fitting a Golf/Jetta master
cylinder.

Has anyone else fitted a dual circuit master cylinder other than the late
bay m/c?  Oldspeed say this shouldn't be used as the master cylinder has the
wrong diameter piston ( I think it is 24mm instead of 23mm)

The Oldspeed kit is very impressive - Russell is very helpful too.

Regards
Paul
