Haven't got net access whilst I am using my laptop, but if it is the tool
such as the one offered by Bugpack, with the two dog ears, then I already
have one.  The nut didn't budge, but the dog ears began to bend.
I think someone has installed the nut and filler without any of the gaskets,
and then possibly over tightened it trying to stop the filler from moving
around.
So I might not even be able to move the nut with a pipe wrench, but its
worth a go.

Thanks
Paul
