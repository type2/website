Must have missed it. General rule of thumb:

all 8mm case nuts and accessories === 14lbs
all six main case nuts            === 23lbs
10mm head studs                   === 23lbs
8mm head studs                    === 18lbs
pulley nut                        === 25lbs
generator pulley nut              === 25lbs
gland nut                         === 250-280lbs
shroud screws  firm hand tight approx 10lbs

i remember at one time seeing a list of torque values for all the bolts and
nuts on a vw. i dont remember where...was it in the bentley manual, or the
idiots guide? i have checked both with no luck, i must be overlooking it.
