Subject: Internal pipe wrench/ hardware stores

I am currently in Indiana on business (I am from the UK) and would like to
get one of these internal pipe wrenches so that I might be able to solve my
loose oil filler problem - however I am not sure what is meant by a hardware
store - let alone the names of businesses I should try.

I have seen a Home Depot a few miles away - would this place sell them or
are there any other chain stores that I should try and find the location of?

Thanks a lot
Paul
