Subject: Re: [VB] removing axles from splitcase tranny?

Thanks Ronnie (and Jon who pmailed),

I actually want to remove the axles so that I can
fit the original barney reduction boxes - they're
sorta split around the springplate
(like a kubel...).

I must admit I have immediately assumed the axles
would have to be changed cos the barney reduction
boxes look so different ..... 

Can anyone tell me if this is actually the case?
Or are the axles the same in a barn and the 'later'
post 54 splitcase tranny?

Sorry for all the questions - this is the first
barn I've owned and I've never actually worked on one before....
-  I'm a bit short on reference material at the moment too...

Thanks

RobK
