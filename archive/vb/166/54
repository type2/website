I know Matt, a lot of books mistakenly call the VW crank a forging. I would
love that to be so because the cost of real forgings are so prohibit ably
high for the regular back yard rebuilder. You can buy a cast crank for as
little as $75 and up to $169 and start doubling and tripling that price for
true forgings. I am furiously trying to track down the two websites, VW/Audi
of Germany and VW of Brazil, (not their main sites but the ones for their
metal works), to once a for all dispel this myth. I guess if you say
something often enough it becomes urban legend and then accepted fact, but
I'm telling you that no Okrassa engine ever broke the sound barrier (I'm
starting that one myself!). I know I will find them again. The reason I was
looking for them before was because of the issue of whether the lifters were
cast or forged, (of course they're cast), but there was quite a discussion
on one of the beetle groups for awhile. Same as the cam which is also cast.

The Book of "Engine and Clutch (1200 and 1500)", Chapter 1, Page 1,
verse 5:

"The crankshaft is forged and its bearing surfaces are induction
 hardened."
