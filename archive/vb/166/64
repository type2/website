OK, I yield, for now. My position is untenable without the proof. Just makes
me want to try all the harder. I won't raise my hand in class again unless I
have the answer in hand!

I guess I should have been more clear.  When I start giving the
"chapter and verse" style, that means I am quoting the Bentley.
The above statement is from the '63-'67 Bentley.  Bentley says
it again in section T, Technical Data: "Crankshaft - High quality
steel forging, four plain bearings".  That section does mention
that the camshaft is cast.

Later editions of the Idiot manual, that have the "History" chapter
in them, mention that in the late 1930s development of the KdF-Wagen,
"crankshafts stopped breaking when they were forged instead of cast."
The mention of stock forged crankshafts in Gene Berg's catalog has
already been pointed out.

Since VW, Gene Berg, and the Idiot manual are all telling me that
stock crankshafts are forged, I'm going to cast my vote for "stock
cranshafts are forged".
