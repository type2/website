Problem is total amount was due right away. I didn't know any better then but it seems now that when
I blew off another company from New York I made a mistake. They were only $100.00 more expensive....
and yes, this is not a carrier but a broker. In my opinion..... no carrier will transport my Bus
from LKC to Chicago for lousy $624.00....... yeah, that cheap. I should of picked the offer that was
in the middle of all estimates ranging from this said company at $624.00 all the way up to
$1,050.00. When I called them today once again nice and polite a guy told me straight forward....
pay extra and we will jump on it or wait more since this is a "discount order". $200.00 is in the
contract - that's processing cost - non refundable. It seems that this is a perfect scam to make
money. Give everybody low price, charge them $200.00 cancellation fee and just sit and wait until
they get fed up and cancel on their own. They never gave me any dates, even approximate. Now the guy
that sold me the Bus has to get rid of it since he's moving to Vegas..... I'm either gonna pay extra
$200.00 or go myself...

don't you love these small businesses? They'll go out of their way to get your business but when
you're trying to give it to them they'll do everything possible to screw it up. I don't think anyone
here would consider this company for their next move...

| I know nothing about this particular outfit, but many of these transport
| companies are actually brokers. If that is the case with this company, they
| deal with a bunch of independent drivers, and simply try to find one who is
| already on a route somewhere close to where yours is.  They collect a bit
| "off the top" for matching you with the driver. Generally the deposit they
| take is actually their cut of the money, whereas the balance you pay on
| delivery is the driver's take.  If they quoted you a lower rate than other
| companies, it's probably because they're hoping to put your bus on the same
| truck as something that's already passing through the area.  If the driver
| doesn't have to go very far out of his way, he'll work for less money.
| For a couple hundred bucks more, they can convince a driver to go further
| out of his way to pick up your bus, thereby (hopefully) getting it picked up
| sooner.  Each broker has a different network of drivers that he calls, so
| there's no telling whether the one you're dealing with will get the bus to
| you sooner or later than another who is doing the same thing.  It's a
| combination of how big that broker's "to call" list is (which you don't
| know) and the luck of the draw (whether anyone he deals with happens to be
| in your area anytime soon). When I used to ship busses from the west to east
| coast to restore and sell them, I usually went for the lowest shipping quote
| and took my chances on delivery time.  Sometimes the bus got picked up a day
| after I paid the deposit, other times weeks later. Sometimes I got only an
| hour's notice that a truck was on its way, and had to scramble to make it
| available or else he'd pass me by and I'd have to wait for the next truck.
| Other times, the broker did the run in pieces, moving the bus half way with
| one driver, and then arranging to leave it parked somewhere until he found
| someone to move it the rest of the way. (This put a scare into me once, when
| a broker went brankrupt and left the bus sitting in a lot somewhere;
| fortunately the original driver knew where it was and arranged for someone
| to bring it the rest of the way.)  I have to admit, though, that 6 weeks is
| nearly as long as I had to wait for pickup in any circumstance.
