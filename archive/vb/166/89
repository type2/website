So how much do the 67 masters cost now then in the US?  I haven't seen any
in the UK although our club shop may have some now.  
With my disc conversion I was going to need to modify the MC so I was hoping
to find an alternative to staying with a modified single circuit MC.

What don't you like about the late bus conversion?  Are you talking about
both methods - using Wolfgangs adapter kit and the other method described on
type2.com? ( I managed to get access to the web and looked at the article on
type2 - ended up ordering the adapter kit from Wolfgang.)

I think I will keep the order with Wolfgang and use that kit to assist me in
fitting the Golf MC or the 944 MC if I decide to go for the rear discs too.
I have a feeling that the 911/912 MC had a piston size of 19mm, whereas the
944 one is 23mm but the 924s could be a possibility also.

Does anyone know how piston size changes the braking effort required to
produce the same amount of braking force?

Thanks
Paul
