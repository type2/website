Subject: Part Need and Bug list

Hey Y'all!
Happy Rainy friday! Anyone out there have an extra front (FIF) engine tin
piece for a dog-house style 1600 DP?? (The piece that sits vertical between
the fan shroud and the tranny) I have some parts I can trade or I can buy it
from you (of course you could also just give it to me;^)
Also, I'll take a Fridday priviledge here and remind everyone that there is a
new TECHNICAL list for bugs. I have learned soooooo much from the Type2 and
Vintagebus lists that I wanted to have a comparable resource to learn about
Type 1's. The noise to signal ratio on some of the other bug list is a bit
much, so this list is based on the Type2 Charter, except geared toward Type1.
So here's the web site with info:

I hope to see you all there!

Peace, John Baker
