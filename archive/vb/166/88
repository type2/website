Subject: Crankshaft  malaise

Hello list!
I don't post very often, but sometimes you guys are the equivalent of the
theologians who spent all of their energies on determining how many angels
could fit on the head of a pin!
---Cut to the chase---
READ your VW histories!  Ferdinand Porche's engineers dumped cast
crankshafts in the late 1930's because they kept breaking.  Casting quality
in pre-WWII Germany was not good enough for the torture endured by a crank
in a boxer engine...even at only 25 HP!!
So if only by tradition, VW stuck with FORGED crankshafts, at least as long
as they were made in Germany.  Later Latin variations on our beloved flat
four have used lessor components.
Good gosh!!  Haven't you ever simply noticed how heavy a German forged VW
crank is...even compared to some cast V8 cranks!!??  Learning a little VW
history will give you a greater appreciation for these little humps of
steel!
