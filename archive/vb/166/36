Subject: RE: [VB] Transport companies

I went through the same thing.  If you reread the agreement the pick up time 
is pretty vague, for the "discount service" for an additional 200 we can 
express your order.  I went w/ hurst auto transport.  My bus got here, but 
it took 5 weeks and several drivers.  1 came by and said it wouldn't fit, 
another wouldn't take it if they couldn't drive it.  I had to give them the 
exact dimensions and weight.  I argued and threatened.  Remember these guys 
have to find a driver willing to take your vehicle and one that is heading 
your way.  The trucks don't work for them, they are called brokers or 
something.  I don't think you would have had any better luck with next 
company on the list either.  Next time I ship a bus I am going with a local 
company.  Also make sure that your shipper, the person on the other en w/ 
the bus, has the battery secured very good or removed after its loaded.  It 
can do some damage.  Also anything that isn't tied down will move around in 
the bus.  My pristine paintjob was damaged and my rear bumper was placed in 
the bus on the floor and slid all over.  Just be patient and email everyday. 
  I email everyday and if I didn't say who I was what order number I had and 
the location and destination of the bus they acted like they didn't know who 
I was, eventhough I emailed them everyday.  Even emailed on the day I got my 
bus, just to give them hell.

Bart
