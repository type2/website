I know nothing about this particular outfit, but many of these transport
companies are actually brokers. If that is the case with this company, they
deal with a bunch of independent drivers, and simply try to find one who is
already on a route somewhere close to where yours is.  They collect a bit
"off the top" for matching you with the driver. Generally the deposit they
take is actually their cut of the money, whereas the balance you pay on
delivery is the driver's take.  If they quoted you a lower rate than other
companies, it's probably because they're hoping to put your bus on the same
truck as something that's already passing through the area.  If the driver
doesn't have to go very far out of his way, he'll work for less money.
For a couple hundred bucks more, they can convince a driver to go further
out of his way to pick up your bus, thereby (hopefully) getting it picked up
sooner.  Each broker has a different network of drivers that he calls, so
there's no telling whether the one you're dealing with will get the bus to
you sooner or later than another who is doing the same thing.  It's a
combination of how big that broker's "to call" list is (which you don't
know) and the luck of the draw (whether anyone he deals with happens to be
in your area anytime soon). When I used to ship busses from the west to east
coast to restore and sell them, I usually went for the lowest shipping quote
and took my chances on delivery time.  Sometimes the bus got picked up a day
after I paid the deposit, other times weeks later. Sometimes I got only an
hour's notice that a truck was on its way, and had to scramble to make it
available or else he'd pass me by and I'd have to wait for the next truck.
Other times, the broker did the run in pieces, moving the bus half way with
one driver, and then arranging to leave it parked somewhere until he found
someone to move it the rest of the way. (This put a scare into me once, when
a broker went brankrupt and left the bus sitting in a lot somewhere;
fortunately the original driver knew where it was and arranged for someone
to bring it the rest of the way.)  I have to admit, though, that 6 weeks is
nearly as long as I had to wait for pickup in any circumstance.
