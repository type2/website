  The NEWER auto tranports can haul a bus on the lower end. When Tommys bus
arrived from back east (1961 Perfect Westy) it was on the lower level. The
biggest bummer of the whole thing was the transport driver valued the 59 cad
more and put it over the bus, leaks and all. They trasported Tommys bus from
Detroit to Lake Havasu for $750 dollars. Picked it up 4 days after the order
was placed and delivered it 5 days later. Excellent company, beautiful rigs.
  They haul a lot of classics for A1 Plus cars in Havasu.

oops....

here is the problem......
VW buses do not fit in all the "holes" of a car transporter as they are too 
tall....
the transport only has a few places they can put them....

and on top sometimes makes the car transporter too tall for Interstate
travel 
(low bridge - OUCH

if it does not run its a bigger hassle because unless they put you car on 
first, they have to winch it on and off to get the other cars off

This is not to stand up for bad business practices of the Auto Shipper,
its just the trucks are built for "normal " size cars.....
