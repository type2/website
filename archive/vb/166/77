[...]"Well your gonna have a hard time finding Greenville/Spartanburg NC, 
You sure you don't mean South Carolina?? =)"

See I don't know.  I was just going off the job description.  You are right 
Greenville/Spartanburg Metro area is in SC.  There is a Greenville NC 
though, so I don't know.  Damn recruiters.  I will have to call and find out 
to be sure.  Thanks.
