oops....

here is the problem......
VW buses do not fit in all the "holes" of a car transporter as they are too 
tall....
the transport only has a few places they can put them....

and on top sometimes makes the car transporter too tall for Interstate travel 
(low bridge - OUCH

if it does not run its a bigger hassle because unless they put you car on 
first, they have to winch it on and off to get the other cars off

This is not to stand up for bad business practices of the Auto Shipper,
its just the trucks are built for "normal " size cars.....
