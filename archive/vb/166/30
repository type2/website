Subject: Re: [VB] Dual circuit master cylinders

Why not use a late beetle master? I dont know about the oldspeed kit but it
works great with stock brakes. Some will say it is too small but it a
helluva lot better than the old single circuit.
as for reservoir, use one from a Volvo 240 if the reservoir holes are big
and one from a rabbit if they are small. Credit to Mark Dearing for this
