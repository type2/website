Subject: Any Listees in NC?

On the move again up the ladder and have gotten a very good offer for a job 
in Greenville / Spartanburg, NC.  Is there a VW scene there?  I am not going 
to have to store my bus after all. Ha!  Just looking for the scoop on the 
area before I fly out for the interview.

Thanks,
