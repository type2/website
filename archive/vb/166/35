Dre, dont take this as a slam but its not always the small business thats
the problem but the greed of the consumer. You said itself, you wouldn't do
it for the money quoted. Those old saws about getting what you pay for and
if it sounds too good it probably is seem appropriate. There's a number of
people in retail on the list, including Ron, who I'm sure have a dozen
stories about  competitors who come into the business and sell/charge too
little either thru incompetence or are just plain crooks. They almost always
go away, but in the meantime they screw up everything for everybody,
including yes, even the consumer who thought he got a ripping deal, but then
all of a sudden no one is there to service/stand behind whatever it is they
bought at such a great price. The sad part, is most of these are smart
people who knew better in the first place.
