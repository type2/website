Kevin-
Front is front ( OK ? :)
The front bearing has lost it's clamping force from the case.
This is also in the oil circuit, so pressure will suffer.
The case passes oil pressure through the tightly held bearings
Any movement also means the case dowel holding that bearing is not.
The crankshaft will whip at this end and damage will escalate.
Best time for a minimal line-bore is now.
