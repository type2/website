Subject: Re: [VB] Transport companies

That's what I think I'll do first thing Monday morning. I came to this conclusion after a whole day
of thinking. Changing the company will not do anything good... it will cost even more. I'll lose the
$200.00 and on top of that start looking for new carrier and it all might take extra time and extra
money. I can't just simply cancel and call my credit company . . . .these guys were wise and only
wanted MO full amount.... stupid me I FedExed it the next day. I admit it..... it's my own fault and
I don't blame all small businesses for this.... I also own one myself. Truth is people should look
at more aspects other than the low price. I almost hired a company from NY and even gave them a
deposit using my Credit Card..... stupid me I canceled with them and hired somebody else.... and the
price was higher only $100.00....... they gave my deposit back with no problem.

For now, I'll send them the extra $200.00 and see what they'll do. At least now we know not to use
these guys or pay the extra money for "Express Service".

Thanks all for suggestions and remarks,

I'll keep you posted,

| Hi Andre,
| Hate to say it . . .but it looks like you should pay the $200 extra, and
| write it off to experience.  If the guy you bought the bus from needs to get
| it off his property - you don't really have a choice.
|
| Also sounds like you'll spend more than the extra $200 in phone calls, lost
| time at work, worry, etc, etc, etc.

| You don't really have much of a choice.
