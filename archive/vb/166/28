I run the Old Speed 944 kit as well on my '66.  It kicks butt!!!

First off to calm any convern the brake lines will bend to fit a baywindow 
M/C conversion using the Wolfgang Int adapter plate.  If you need a "T" 
piece Rocky Mountain or Bus Depot (dropped from RMMW -but $1 less) has them 
new.

There is zero problem with running the bay M/C as it was designed for 
disc/drum setup.  The only concern would be if you have chicken legs and 
cannot depress the pedal with a little more effort with a 24mm plunger.  
Seriously though you will not be able to tell a difference.  Usually larger 
plungers take more "leg" w/o power assist.

In the future I plan to add 944 rear brakes on small nut RGBs and run the 
944 MC with it for better F/R modulation.  The 944 MC is really a design 
work of art... I will not bore anyone with the details.  Hopefully the rear 
brakes should arrive today or tomorrow :)  As a side note a 944 resivoir is 
need on this MC as no VW part will fit, the overflow nipple needs epoxy 
plugged as well.

Food for thought from a Stillen t-shirt:
"If speed kills, do brakes give life?"  (with big red Brembos in the 
background)

Thomas and I have both been messing with these 944 brakes systems, so give 
us a shout if you need assistence.

On a possitive note at least we are saving good used Porsche parts from 
yucky watercoolers and putting them in real air-coolers as Ferdinand would 
want.  :)

Good Luck,
Adrian
