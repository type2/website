I've had four VWs shipped from the west to NJ. Had one bad experience, and 
that was with AAA Advantage in Tempe, AZ. They brokered out the job to a 
place in Miami who damaged the car and refused to pay the claim because the 
car needed some restoration work! 

I have had good experiences with White Cloud Auto Transport out of Boise 
Idaho. Small outfit, not a broker, they use their own drivers. Very nice 
folks. I used them twice and was pleased both times.

I had a decent experience with Transcar recently. Bought my SC in Moab, UT. I 
would have used White Cloud but they don't cover southern UT. Transacr took 
forever (4-5 weeks). I bugged them daily. Finally they offered to "eat" the 
$200 deposit (which was to be their part of the $$$) and post it on the 
driver's board at a $200 higher rate. Guess what? Once they did that, it was 
picked up in two days.

It's a scary thing, shipping a VW. My only advice is to ask others on the 
list who they have had good experiences with before placing a shipping order. 
And don't pay in full until the car arrives and you have a chance to look it 
over.
