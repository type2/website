Subject: Re: [VB] Internal pipe wrench/ hardware stores

Home Depot may have internal pipe wrenches. "a hardware store" or better 
will be a plumbing supply shop. The hardware store are some times 
smaller local stores that sell nuts, bolts, plumbing, rope, chain, 
etc.... The phone book look up hardware store that may work. Have fun 
traveling home with your heavy bag.
