I used Dependable Auto Transport from Portland OR to Boston and paid the
extra $300 for firm dates because the seller wasn't going to hang around. I
think they have their own trucks, but I'm not sure. They were ok and have
this cool tracking system you can look up via the web.

They delivered on time, but lost the door keys! All I got was the ignition
key.
Still need to have Gabriel the key guy door the singlr key conversion...
