Subject: Jerome 2005 Pix-who might have some?

Does anyone have pictures of Jenn winning the raffle bus at this years Jerome
Jamboree?  She is looking for pictures of the actual raffle taking place as
the countdown was happening.  She wants to make a scrap book of the event.
I've checked on 'thesamba' but no dice.

Anyone?  You can send them to me at vwdragon(-at-)citlink.net and I'll get them to
her,

Thank you,

Lou & Lis in Havasu
