Yah,
	Balanced and unbent wheels are a good thing!  Put an inner tube in 
a tire and spin balance it and you will use a lot of weights.  My 
experience.  I doubt that the straightness of the wheel is the big issue 
with big hole vw wheels unless you are driving a thirty five year old 
1200cc Formula V going fast, say, over 70 mph.   Get your toe-in right.  
That will help any old VW.....  Gary Gibson
