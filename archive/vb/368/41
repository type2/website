Subject: Re: [VB] Silicone sump plate gaskets.

Did you have to extend the studs? I started to install the silicone 
gaskets and found the the studs were too short. I didn't have the time 
to extend the studs so paper gaskets went back on the engine.

I ordered up a pair of silicone gaskets that Eric suggested at
aircooled.net.  They arrived yesterday and I popped them right on the motor.
