Subject: Re: Balancing Tires.......

Thanks Matt for the tips....... The one thing I forgot to mention was that
the second rim that previously balanced OK and is now  apparently "bent"
never saw the road. It was the spare.

Driving the '67 was fine with no vibration....... what started this need to
rebalance is one of my tires took a screw in the sidewall, so ordered a
couple of new replacements. Wide fives may be relatively more prone to
damage, but they are not weak and will take a lot of abuse to a point.
