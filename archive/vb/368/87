Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Balancing Tires.......

Second hand tire shops can balance big hole rims/tires on a bubble 
balance.  Sure, this type of balance sucks compared to high speed or on 
the vehicle balance.  Bubble balance was the wheel balance used when our 
old VWs weren't so old.  So, it is better than nothing.  Also, it 
sometimes seems that if you mount tubeless tires on old tube type rims 
that the wheels appear to be bent when spun on a high speed 
balance.....  Gary Gibson
