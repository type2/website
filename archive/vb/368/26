Subject: Bus Tow Bar Needed in San Diego

We have a bus we need to move about 2 miles.  We have rented a truck with a 
hitch, but need a tow bar and the receiver part of the hitch (the part that 
slides in and has the ball attached to it)

We're located in El Cajon and would prefer someone close by, but beggars 
cant be choosers can come get the stuff.  We only need it for an afternoon 
and can return as soon as we're done.  We will be happy to leave something 
as a deposit ($ or similar)

Bus involved is a well knows turkis 63 DD Panel =)

Thanks!!
