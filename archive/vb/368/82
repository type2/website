Subject: Balancing tires.

Hi,

Out here in So. Cal. I had America's Tire (Discount Tires in other states) 
store do the tire install. They had an adapter that consisted of a flat 
plate that my wheel butted up against and on the outside, a cone was spun 
down on the 5 rounds that extend toward the center from the bolt holes. A 
small flat was produced and the paint was slightly dinged on the tip of each 
round. The result was nice hi speed balanced wheels and tires. 80 (no flames 
please) on the freeway and no shake or shimmy.
