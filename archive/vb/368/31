Subject: NEW Kafer 34Pict-3 FS unused

i offered this to a Listee, but haven't heard back; if he isn't 
interested, I thought I'd offer it to the Lists before the ebaywindow 
route....

brand-new, never used NEW 34Pict-3 from 'Kafer,' the chinese made vw 
parts company. i bought it from cip1 and it doesn't fit my small SP 
manifold - the heck with it. at this point with this motor, i have no 
interest in digging out my good used FI manifold, cleaning it, 
dropping engine, teardown and reassembly of tin, etc, etc. i paid 
$119 plus shipping IIRC ; i'm asking $100 and I'LL pay shipping. i 
did take the main jet out to read size (it doesn't HAVE a size 
mark!), and put alcohol in the carb to check for accel pump working, 
and to see where the jets squirted down the throat. but i've never 
INSTALLED it...
if you put it on and it DOESN'T work, i'll refund money upon 
return.... which is more than cip1 offered ME! i'll just send cip1  a 
nasty note  )8P

if the original Listee doesn't respond by say, tuesday, first 
responder gets it.

also willing to trade for WORKING :) dakota digital cht guage - even 
the older  rectangular one.

let me know.
