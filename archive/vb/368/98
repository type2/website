Subject: Balancing Tires....... The Conclusion

Discovered today what happened..... but that doesn't entirely discount the
overly fluffy person falling backwards under extreme acceleration theory
either.....

Another rim shop confirmed the first shop in that 2 out of three rims are
now out/bent by 1/2". So the culprit that bent the rims has now been
identified ..........the tire changing machine that put the new tires on the
rims last Saturday.

So now I have to pay to get the rims straightened and repainted silver
white....... Basically more time and $$$ ......but then where would the fun
be in this hobby..... :<)

Not overly ticked off as I am only one of about 4 people that drive these
old buses, and the mechanical experience to do this stuff as we know is
rapidly disappearing. But hoping to recover the tire mounting costs in any
event.....

On the bright side, it was my regular independent mechanic that solved this
puzzle, but it gets better.....

After initially looking at his balancer and saying he couldn't do it, and
phoning around to hear the horror stories, his memory starts to improve.
First relization is that both his tire changer and balancer are of the same
era as the rim roughly ............ memory of an adapter for these rims
starts to surface.......... and then he finds it in a back corner!

So made a standing offer to buy/intercept his old machines should he be
tempted to dump them. I figure with a lot more interest in keeping these old
buses around and everybody else tossing their tire machines away,  that it
would be a "very lucrative" business indeed........  ;<)

Thanks again for all the tips and info!

Scott
