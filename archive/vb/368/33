The schedule is as follows:

Friday: Come on in and camp.

Saturday: Make breakfast burritos under the cooking shed. Hang out. 
Carve pumpkins for the contest. Walk around the farm. Eat lunch. Hang 
out more. About 6:30 if you want to do a communal dinner, bring it to 
the cooking shed along with the completed voting sheet for the pumpkin 
carving contest. After dinner we'll announce who won the pumpkin carving 
contest, give prizes if there's any to give away and commence to having 
even more camping fun, starting with Trick or Treating.

Sunday: Eat breakfast, hang out, pack, leave when you want or stay and 
help clean up and maybe help put stone on the castle or something.
