Subject: (VB) RE: seat belts

Based on Matt Roberds reference:

http://www.roaminangelsinc.com/HTMLS/Sep05/BeltLess.html

it appears a safe bet that 1962 was the year they became mandatory
for the front at least (minimum requirement) in California.
My 1963 15 window (walk-through) has what appears to be dealer installed
belts in the front. The '63 transporter owners manual (February 1963 edition)
page 19, state's "safety belts are available at your VW "service station".
It apears they were only available for the driver and front passenger.
As a side note. In 1966 I purchased a brand new deluxe bug from Truman
Motors in El Cajon, California. I was in the Navy at the time, stationed at
NAS Miramar, north of San Diego. The car came with seat belts, front and
back.
