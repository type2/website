Wilson (How to Rebuild) says a 311 101 373 A is a '67-70 1500 or 1600
head with 35.5 mm intake and 32 mm exhaust valves.  Presumably the "E"
version could be used to replace this one and would have similar specs.
In the intervening 30 years, the head could have been machined into
something totally different.
