Hi Volks,

Have I got a story for you....

A few years ago a young man from windsor joined our local online VW  
mailing list, having just purchased a very rough 1972 Riviera camper.  
He wanted to restore the bus, and needed help. He was working at the  
local grocery store and poured a ton of $$ into rebuilding the  
engine, suspension, steering and tires. Not long after he decided on  
a career in the military. He and another list-member had just  
finished the engine rebuild when he was called up for Basic Training  
with the Army, and after a year at CFB Petawawa he decided on a tour  
of peacekeeping duties overseas in Kabul, Afghanistan.

Just before he got back, one of the members of our group remarked at  
a camp-out that it would be a nice thing to do if we got together and  
finished off the work on his bus before he got back.... sort of like  
a real-life "Over-haulin" kind of thing. We called it "Project:  
Yellow Ribbon".
