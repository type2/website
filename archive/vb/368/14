Subject: why so many different exhausts?

I have to replace all or part of my exhaust, but when I saw all the 
choices of aftermarket ones in an EMPI catalog I became really 
confused and indecisive.   Is the stock really best? Best is a 
relative term -  I would like one that helps my gas mileage, but is 
quiet and high off the ground.

My muffler has blown. I had a small leak welded, but it caused others 
to pop.  The donut clamps seem loose, but apparently that can be the 
header pipes wearing inside one another? The tailpipe support was 
also welded to the body, and that broke.   I think the whole thing a 
disaster. The backfires are so loud, I am sure someone will pull a 
gun and shoot back!!

I have a spare  exhaust that is a double 'glass' thing. #3602 in the 
EMPI book.  It doubles back on itself, and has 2 chrome tailpipes. 
The triangle junction is much larger than the one I have now, if that 
means anything to anyone.  Besides, I dont have the gasket for that.

so I am looking for opinions. There must be some reason there are so 
many options.

thanks
