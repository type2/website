Subject: steering issues

Well the past few weeks I've noticed the front end making bad sounds, and
feeling weird when turning.

So, given that it's been raining all week-I decided to go to my mechanic. We
put it up on the lift, and it appears that the shaft that the pitman arm
rotates on is loose. He said-"...go get a new steering box".

So I've looked on the web-it appears as though Bus Depot and Bus-Boys carry
it...anyone else? Any reason to get it from one source over another? I
assume you can only get rebuilt steering boxes(as opposed to  being able to
get a new one?

Thanks for any suggestions...
