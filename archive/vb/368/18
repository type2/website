Hi,

The last couple drives down the freeway gave me a start. After about half an
hour of running at around 70 (please, no flames. you take what you can when
you live in L.A.), the engine bucked when I lifted my foot off the gas just
a little. Did that until I slowed down to around 60 for a few minutes. It
did it again when I returned to left lane cruise speed. All I can think of
is that there was not enough fuel in the carb bowl. I have a weber 2 barrel
progressive. My fuel pressure regulator is set to 3-1/2. I started with it
at 2-1/2.

Any thoughts out there?

Chris
