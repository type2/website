Hi Chris,

So if it is the roller bearing...how do you tighten it up? Do I follow the
procedure explained for "Adjusting steering gear (installed) in Bentley V-9
p.13?

Looking at Bentley V-9 pg 8 there is a diagram-I assume the bearings that
you are talking about are item #6 -taper rollers(16 each side)?

Thanks for the suggestions...

If it is the shaft that hangs out the side of the box, I would bet that the 
roller bearings came loose. Open up that box and investigate closely!! Those

boxes are built like a brick SH. Other than the worm gear wearing out, none 
of the rest of it should be a problem.
