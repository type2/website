I did check that first. no good there. I can feel the entire assembly
move. This includes the pulley and fan, but not the alternator
housing.

yes I double checked by pulling the front half of the pulley off and
sure enough the shaft was moving. I would have taken the rear half of
the pulley off, but it held quite nicely on the shaft and didn't want
to move any with some simple work on my part.
 
I think I might need to get the back half of the pulley off and look
there.
