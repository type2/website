Subject: John Brown Buses' T-Shirts

Okay, it's getting close to that time. Only 16 days left until John Browns
Buses in Harpers Ferry West Virginia. One of the best campouts in the area.

The t-shirts have been ordered from the tye dye guy and I am now taking
orders. Since we didn't have alot of time this year to coordinate things I
need to know ASAP who would like one.

The prices will be $15 for short sleeve and $20 for long sleeve. They range in
size from youth medium to adult XXL. You can pay for them at the campout. No
need to prepay! I will only have a limited number of shirts for sale at JBB
unless you send me an email with your request. toby.gun(-at-)verizon.net

Hope everyone is looking forward to fall in the mountains.

See ya there!
