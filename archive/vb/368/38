Subject: Silicone sump plate gaskets.

This is a follow up from a previous thread a few weeks ago about sump plate
gaskets.

 

I ordered up a pair of silicone gaskets that Eric suggested at
aircooled.net.  They arrived yesterday and I popped them right on the motor.
Which is on the engine stand at the moment so it was very easy :-)  (stay
tuned for the CIS fuel injection conversion!).

 

Very nice product!  The old cardboard gasket was literally weeping oil right
through itself.   

 

After some road testing I will report back again.

 

Take Care,
