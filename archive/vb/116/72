Subject: Re: [VB] Oil light puzzle

> Why does my oil light stay on?  When I start the DC and the engine is cold, the light comes on when I turn the key then stays on as soon as the engine starts?  The oil level reads full, and the engine isn't hot.  I just had the engine rebuilt, 1904cc, it has an oil sump and an full flow oil filter.  Ideas?

Or no pressure. You may need to prime the oil pump.
You can accomplish this by filling the sender hole with oil using a
syringe or baster etc.
You can rotate the engien some to get as much oil in and air out as
possible. Then try it again. Do not start the engine until you are sure
there is oil pressure.
