My brother's '66 Riviera and the AVBC "co-founder's" '67 Riviera and others.  My DC is down with valve train problems so I caught a ride in a rented stupid-big 2002 domestic doublecab. How stupid-big you ask? We cheered to find it egged after the festival!

Found it egged?  Is that what people are doing to big SUV type vehicles now????

Hey, just found out about an hour ago that I'll be making a fresno run next monday.  I have a load of robots and a complete conveyor system waiting for me. You and Karl up for an early dinner and a brew before I head back that evening?
