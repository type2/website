Subject: Re: [VB] 1/3-2/3 seat question

Sounds like Jason ia talking about the middle seat-  which did get the 
cardboard backing.  From what I've seen the springs behind the front 1/3 2/3 
seat are exposed to the metal partition. Useful for tucking maps in there, 
and a spare fan belt or clutch cable.

some years had different material for the sides than for the seat and the 
face of the back.  Other years used the same material.   No idea what to do 
to clean up the rust, but I remember someone lamenting that he cleaned the 
springs, as they always squeaked afterwards- so I guess there is some sort of 
antisqueak lube in there.

 There is a piece of thin board under the upholstery on
 the back of the seat as well. It's made of something
 like plastic or tar board. This prevents narrow
 objects from easily poking through the vinyl into the
 cavity of the seat back, and (on microbuses - standard
 and deluxe)it also serves as a foundation for the
 ashtray mount.
