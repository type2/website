If you read the manual, the J-tin deflects the down flowing hot air to the
rear and away from the engine. That was it's primary and intended use.

Looking for opinions on the bottom tin...the pieces that attach to the case
and the heater boxes.  The local shop owners believe them to be gravel
guards to protect the push rod tubes from flying rocks.  Others think you
have to run EVERY piece of the tin in order for the complete system to work.
I'm running the type 3 or "Cool tin" on the bottom of my cylinders.  I
wanted the air exiting the bottom of the cylinders to blow across the oil
sump, theoretically cooling it (while stopped) so I made "shorty" bottom
tins.  basically cut them at the first case attachment screw tab.  Figured
that would be good enough to keep the gravel out.  Any other opinions on
this one?
