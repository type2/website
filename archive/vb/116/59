Subject: RE: [VB] Smoken rings

Incorrect ring end gap? Slightly off p and/or cs (that would be far
worse I imagine) What's compression at?
 Just a guess... Did you break them in at approx 2k rpm after intial
start up for 20 mins and change oil then?
Hope you work that out....Perplexing issues with mystery causes really
stink....

List,
I saw the question about the stuck rings, and I remembered the problem
with
my crewcab. (Been sittin awhile.)
I HAD to build the 1776 for my crewcab. Got it all together, with brand
new
pistons and rings...and it smokes like a grenade!
I ran it for about 2 hours total at idle...woudldn't smoke then
boooooom.... "tactical insertion requested" I drove it for about 30
miles...same thing.
No smoke- smoke like a chimney- no smoke.  Seems more prevalent after it

warms up.
I ripped off the heads to verify that the rings weren't lined up. Found
them
all at an offset. All was good. then same thing.
Any ideas? I had the heads 'looked at' by a local VW guy here, he thinks

they are OK.
I live in Colorado- they are pretty upset with my attempt at artificial
cloud-making.

   Jeremy
