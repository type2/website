Subject: Low oil pressure at idle and heating up.

Just got the DC and relatively fresh 1600 DP. Oil smells of gas. Was fine, good
power. Has the old fuel pump w/ screws on cap; the rebuildable one. Wondering if
I can change oil and fresh gaskets on pump. What is this pump called anyway?
Thanks for any ideas.
Mike
