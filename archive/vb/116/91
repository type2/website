Actually they have trademarked, copy righted, and patented, all forms of
paper, paper products, and products made or using pre or post paper
processing materials. In addition to the napkin in question and a plethora
of other products you should be aware this would also include leaves &
splinters.  If you have a tree which has leaves, you should expect a letter
from VOA in the near future.
