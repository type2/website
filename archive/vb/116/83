Hoping folks who have done dealings with joe ruiz will share their =
experiences. I am thinking that I may buy one of his dipped and =
restamped cases for my 57 and since I've  never really delt with him I'd =
like to hear from those who have before I send off that wad of cash. =
Interested in quality of product and service/turnaround
thanks
ronnie
