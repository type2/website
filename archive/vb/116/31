I use modified (cut the wings off) T-3 cool tins on my personal engines.
They do a great job of what they are supposed to do, direct more cooling air
around a larger diameter of the cylinders. Then under that I have the
factory J-tin. They do exactly what the factory intended, direct all that
hot air from around the cylinders to the rear and away from the engine. You
can substitute modified T-3 cool tin for your T-1 cool tin, (a great idea),
but there is no substitute for the J-tin and it's function.

But what about when using the T3 cool tins as was first posted?  As I
understand it the T3 didn't have the tins underneath.  The air from the
tins went straight down.  I know pretty much zero about type3s though.
