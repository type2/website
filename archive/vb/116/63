Subject: Quick help need on reproduction round mirrors

Hope i can get some more help here.  Can anyone who
has a round reproduction mirror please measure the
edge crimp on there mirror.  The part that holds the
mirror in place.  How tall is it?  My repro set has an
edge that is considerably larger then my OG used
mirror.  

I am still battling over a set of supposed NOS round
mirrors.  They look correct in almost every way.  They
are not polished though and the transition on the back
from the dome to the edge is very pronounced instead
of smooth like my OG used mirror.  They look like
brushed aluminum to me.

any help out there?

Thanks
Matthew
