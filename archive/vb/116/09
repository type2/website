Subject: ez camper water tank leak

this dumb bus owner I know was trying to fix his water tank which was lea=
king-
and he overtightened the drainage tube-and therefore the tank leaks
worse....any ideas what I(I mean this guy I know) can do to fix this? or
anyone have any leads on an old one?

thanks
