Subject: re:starter woes

sound like the infamous"hot start problem" I had this with my bus, replac=
ed
the solenoid.....quitepainfully for a newbie-then installed the relay and=
 have
had no problems since....You can purchase this relay thing from most VW
shops-somehow it shortens the distance the electricity needs to travel to=
 the
starter.

if you chekc the archives- I beleive there is considerable discussion on
this.

good luck
