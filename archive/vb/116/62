We sell the following German mufflers and exhaust systems. The earlier ones
are Leistritz, the later one Ernst. Both are OE suppliers to VW, and I have
not seen a significant difference in quality between the two brands. Both
are far superior to the Mexican, Brazilian, and even Danish ones that are
also available.  Prices include listmember discount.
