Subject: Re: [VB] front wheel bearing questions

I did my front bearings last year, and it sounds like you got it right. 
The notched washer is called the 'thrust washer' and must be present to
seat and adjust the bearings properly.  The bendable lock washer ('lock
plate') goes between the two hex nuts.  I wasn't sure about those new
plastic grease seals either, so I ended up reusing my old-style ones
'cuz they were still good.
