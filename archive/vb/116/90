Subject: RE: [VB] experience with joe ruiz?

Hi All,

I've done a reasonable amount of biz with Joe.... the engine for the 59
double cab will be a MrOkrasa brand motor.... nos case, 40hp okrasa setup.
I think I paid my down payment a couple of years ago and I'm still waiting
for the motor... but that's not his fault but mine since I'm still waiting
for my og bed slat screws and you all know I can't finish the dc with out
them so I keep telling him to hold off on sending the motor up to me.

He also supplied me with most of the pieces for my Mag supercharged 36hp
okrasa ghia vert motor (http://www.dsquared-dev.com/davem/blowers.htm)  and
I just picked up some nos 1500 P/Cs from him and some rare empi 82mm P/Cs.
I guess this means that I have been satisfied with the level of service and
time he has been willing to spend with me.

By the way, the case shown on the above mentioned web site is one of his
dipped and restamped cases.

>>>> Ronnie (the other one) asked:  Hoping folks who have done dealings with
joe ruiz will share their experiences. I am thinking that I may buy one of
his dipped and restamped cases for my 57 and since I've  never really delt
with him I'd like to hear from those who have before I send off that wad of
cash. Interested in quality of product and service/turnaround
thanks
ronnie
