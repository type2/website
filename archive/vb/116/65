Subject: RE: [VB] Quick help need on reproduction round mirrors

First generation repo have a sharpe edge where the mirror goes in and will
cut your finger if not carefull, discontinued, these also have a brushed
finish.

Second generation have a rolled edge with a piece of rubber holding in the
mirror.

Third generation are just like OG, I have not seen these but did talk to the
manufacturer and they are being made exclussively for WW.

Izzys and Flat Fours are polished stainless. Flat Four has there name
stamped in them and IZZYS has the VW part number.

There are also a couple other companies that I have found made them (long
ago) and look like VW's but without the part number. I guess one day I can
take pictures of them all and show the differences.

Subject: [VB] Quick help need on reproduction round mirrors


Hope i can get some more help here.  Can anyone who
has a round reproduction mirror please measure the
edge crimp on there mirror.  The part that holds the
mirror in place.  How tall is it?  My repro set has an
edge that is considerably larger then my OG used
mirror.  

I am still battling over a set of supposed NOS round
mirrors.  They look correct in almost every way.  They
are not polished though and the transition on the back
from the dome to the edge is very pronounced instead
of smooth like my OG used mirror.  They look like
brushed aluminum to me.

any help out there?

Thanks
Matthew
