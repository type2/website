Subject:  Australian Container Van


The fairly rotten container van (I don't use that word
much but that's what they were called here, rather than a 'bus')
that was on e-bay generated a fair bit of interest up there
for some reason...

I have a mate who had one and used it as a surf bus.  I have
put a couple of nostalgia photos at

http://users.pipeline.com.au/hoopty/aus_container.htm

He actually still had it on his property near Bells Beach until 
reasonably recent times.....A couple of years ago he sold it too another
mate who in turned it over fairly quickly and sold it 'up country'.
(I must admit I personally never found it intuitively appealing as a
project....). 

I should be able to get hold of the 2nd in the chain of sale at some point
and
I'll see if I can track where it ended up.
