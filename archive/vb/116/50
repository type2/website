Subject: Pressure Releif Springs


My Sons Panel is on the road!! HOORAY!!  Enormous smiles all around... 
truly.  However... yeah there always is one of those isn't there.  When he 
assembled the engine he put high pressure oil relief springs into it.  I 
advised against it but of course... well, some of you have heard the story.  
Anyway, don't know if that can contribute to oil leaks but the engine is 
leaking from a number of places after only a few hundred miles.  I haven't 
had an opportunity to look at it yet since I have only his "observation" to 
go by.  So, listees, I ask you... can this be or has anyone found it to be a 
problem?  We will be pulling the engine this weekend if not sooner to 
retorque but he is talking tearing it all the way down to see what he can 
see.

All this and the other son is beginning assembly on his 383 stroker to put 
in his Friday night car... sigh.  At this rate I will never get to my 
15-window.... sorry troops, had to rant a moment there.
