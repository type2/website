Subject: Smoken rings

List,
I saw the question about the stuck rings, and I remembered the problem with 
my crewcab. (Been sittin awhile.)
I HAD to build the 1776 for my crewcab. Got it all together, with brand new 
pistons and rings...and it smokes like a grenade!
I ran it for about 2 hours total at idle...woudldn't smoke then boooooom....
"tactical insertion requested" I drove it for about 30 miles...same thing. 
No smoke- smoke like a chimney- no smoke.  Seems more prevalent after it 
warms up.
I ripped off the heads to verify that the rings weren't lined up. Found them 
all at an offset. All was good. then same thing.
Any ideas? I had the heads 'looked at' by a local VW guy here, he thinks 
they are OK.
I live in Colorado- they are pretty upset with my attempt at artificial 
cloud-making.

   Jeremy
