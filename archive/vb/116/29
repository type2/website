I would do the standard retorque and check the plugs, points, etc. If it was
running fine when you pulled it, that should do it.

Hi List,
I put in my newly built 1776cc this past weekend in my
63 crew cab. The old engine is a 1600dp. It's sitting
in my garage right now but is going in my 67 Sundial.
My question is this: While it's sitting on a pallet in
the garage is there anything in particular I should do
to it before the install? The motor is less than 6
months old (rebuilt). It has approx. 5000 to 6000
miles on it. I was not experiencing any problems with
it at time of replacement, I just wanted a performance
engine in my crew cab. As far as I know there is
nothing wrong with it. Anywho, is there anything yall
would recommend doing or checking while it's out??

Thanks,

3DPete
