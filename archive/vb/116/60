Subject: NON vw 1500 muffler

Hi All,

I'm succumbing to the notion that I may have to put a non og muffler on the
tipper if I ever hope to get it on the road again.  Please don't think less
of me....... well, ok, I may have found an NOS 1500, VW stamped muffler but
just in case it doesn't pan out I need a backup plan.

I've poked around on the internet and have found a number of *German* 1500
mufflers ranging anywhere from $62 at WW to $49 from Larry Reno at
wagenwerks.  Can anyone tell me who's *german* fits better or are they all
the same manufacturer?

.... then again, maybe someone will make my day and tell me they have a good
used 1500, VW stamped 1500 muffler?
