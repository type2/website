Subject: fresh air flap control?

Well, the painting is done, and I am putting my bus back together.

 

I installed a new gasket on the fresh air flap -

I am trying to re-install the rod that controls the fresh air flap. It
connects/secures itself to the flap with two set screws with slots on the
top. I already stripped the head off of one. So I went to my local hardware
store got two new set screws, adjust with allen wrench instead of flat head
screwdriver. This should allow me a bit more torque.

 

The odd thing is that the flat part of the rod-which is what the screws
should bear into, do not align properly with the flap in the right position.
I actually can see old marks from when it was originally installed, that the
screws made. These marks are on the round part of the rod, not the flat
part.

 

Anyone know anything about this? Should I just try to put it back how it was
before? It seems like if I put the rod in the 'correct' place, according to
Bentley, than the handle will be sticking down instead of alongside the
metal overhead piece.

 

Suggestions/comments appreciated.
