Subject: windshield sealant

When installing the front windows  I've read in Bentley to use D10, Genuine
VW Window Cement. I know you guys on the list have recommended roofing tar.
Is there any issue with the tar reacting with the rubber?

 

Do you just put the tar on the body where the seal goes? Or do you need
sealant between the glass and the rubber seal?

 

Also do you need any type of sealant when installing the rear glass?
