There exists adapter plates that allow you to use 34mm carbs on
later stock SP manifolds.  I've also seen various after market SP
manifolds that'll fit 34's, two barrel carbs ( I've got a sp dual
manifold that works great with my double barrel Zenith) and so on.
You may find better carb/manifold choices for your single port engine
than what you are now using?

If I could only find an adaptor for SU carb(s)...I gotta whole herd of
SU carbs... ;-)

Hi Craig,

     A small carb should give strong low end torque and a restricted top

end, is that what you were trying to achieve?  What's the engine's
displacement?
