Subject: RE: [VB] Oil Bath Air Cleaner ... and bracket ... 

Thanks Clara .. that is exactly the problem .. the good news is it turns out
that I have the entire bracket ... I had the piece that goes onto the front
of the fan housing after all. 

 

So .. what about that manual choke carb you bought a few years ago from
busdepot ... how is it holding up? The guy that installed my 1600 hates that
carb ... but I really liked the manual choke ... is your carb still working
OK? 

 

How bout crank start? Did you ever install a crank start on a 1600? I want
to do that if it makes sense .. but if its stupid I won't bother.

 

TIA
