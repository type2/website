Subject: Re: [VB] Oil Bath Air Cleaner ... and bracket ... 

 The air cleaner and bus and bracket were all designed for a 40hp motor.
Generally on a 1600 they don't quite line up.  About 90% of 1600s are how you
describe, and need a spacer for the air cleaner triangle brackets.
Get a piece of metal and drill two holes in it.
This is a pic of my 61 bus:

There are a number of 1500/1600 intake manifolds.    Some have the carb
slightly more to the left or right, up or down.
 I have seen a couple times where the bolts line up and no spacer is needed.
They always seem to line up on 40hp/ 36hp engines.

I went to put my oil bath air cleaner on my 60 today and it appears not to
fit . that is, I have a bracket I picked up from a 62 at a wrecker . it fits
right on the spot on the fan shroud . but the air cleaner doesn't bolt on ..
The hole on the tab on the arm of the air cleaner just misses the hole on
the bracket . ..
