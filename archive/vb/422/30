Hi Craig,
	There exists adapter plates that allow you to use 34mm carbs on  
later stock SP manifolds.  I've also seen various after market SP  
manifolds that'll fit 34's, two barrel carbs ( I've got a sp dual  
manifold that works great with my double barrel Zenith) and so on.   
You may find better carb/manifold choices for your single port engine  
than what you are now using?
	A small carb should give strong low end torque and a restricted top  
end, is that what you were trying to achieve?  What's the engine's  
displacement?
Gary
