Subject: Fun with my bus

Hi,

I have a left over bit of white LED light string that I am adding to my engine
compartment with a switch to turn it on when the engine lid is opened. Anyone
have a good idea as to where I could easily pick up 12V to run the light? I
was thinking about tapping in on the alternator connection as I could use a
ring lug. Of course an inline fuse will be used too. Any better ideas?

Cheers!
