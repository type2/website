 Hi Jdd,
25 HP thru 1600 DH shrouds are EXACTLY the same width and depth.
    If you are running a 1200 cc engine the air cleaner should have no problem
with the shroud bracket.

   OTOH if you are running a 1500, 1600, etc., those were designed with the 12
volt larger sized generator.  This in turn required moving the carb over to
the left slightly abut 1/2".  So guess what VW did to the intake
manifold.......
   If that is what you are running then you need a home made spacer to get the
bracket and air cleaner to connect.
