Apologies for the cross-posting.

Buses By The Bridge, Windsor Beach 4, Lake Havasu State Park, AZ Jan
15-17,2010.  Based on reliable reports, this is probably gonna be the
biggest ever with Buses, Vanagons, Eurovans, Westys, EVCs and perhaps a
Rialta or two from all points in the country (and some flying in from
foreign lands).  Yeah, I'll be there (it'll be great to get out of the
office for a few days).  Weather forecast is upper 60s during the day, mid
40s at night.  Plenty of fire tubs to keep warm by, good people too.

Geez, 4am's gonna come early tomorrow morning here in Ventura, CA.
