Subject: Re: [VB] too cool for school

You don't want it too hot,  you don't want it too cold, but juuuuust right.

I had the problem of the engine staying too cold when I tried a small gen
pulley.  My oil temps barely got to 165 after driving on the freeway for
hours.
That is ridiculous.   That can't be good for the engine.
 It made me realise that you really gotta pull back from the "make it run
cooler" mindset.
  It is about balance.
 It is about the middle way.

Meditate on this, as you remove the small gen pulley and put a regular gen
pulley and fan belt back on.

  I would only run the small gen pulley if it was regularly above 90F outside.
You can look at the thermostat and see whether it expands. (though not while
driving)
