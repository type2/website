Thanks to a contribution by the generous Mike Robus, "Progressive Refinements" 
(1940 - 1961) has been added to the oacdp:

  http://oacdp.org/progref4061.html

There are two outstanding issues to be resolved before it gets linked onto the 
site's index page, one of which I'm hoping to get a little help here on the 
list.

On all pages there are four columns of information.  I'm wondering, can anyone 
shed some light about the third column, which is labeled Body or Unit number?

I ask because some times these numbers seem to be body numbers (the ones found 
on pre Oct 1958 VW's):

Other times they seem related to the section they are in, such as in engines 
where the "Unit No." looks like an engine number:

Where it gets weird is on say the electrical section.  What would the third 
column of this (post-Oct 1958) page represent:

Anyways any insight would be appreciated and on another note look forward to 
the 1962-1968 version which is in the works.

Cheers,
