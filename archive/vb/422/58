Hello Fellow Bus Pilots,

It is that time again for the annual pilgrimage of Bus Pilots to converge
upon Pokagon State Park in Angola, IN. Buses and their frozen pilots will be
traversing the snow and ice covered roads in search of what they long for; a
chance to toot the horn, smell the exhaust from their magnesium block
engines and to camp with good friends. Heater boxes are for sissies when it
comes to this adventurous winter campout. Those Bus Pilots sporting J
pipes, a snowmobile suit and ice scraper in one hand to use while driving
earn major style points with this crowd.



As the winter seems to drag on to long and our need to disappear in our
buses seem to become greater, then shake the winter blues and join us for
this fun family (and dog) friendly campout. There will be lots to eat. Many
people bring crock pots and plug them in with soups and chilies to be
enjoyed by all. At the campground there will be a roaring bon fire, heated
bathrooms, electricity for heaters and a toboggan run that is < mile long
and goes 40 MPH. (faster then many of our buses!) We will be giving away a
Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors Stadium Blanket that rolls up into a
holder to the winner of the Cozy Bus Award. Average temps for Angola,
Indiana in February is a high of 33 and a low of 16.



Everyone will be arriving around 12:30 -1:00PM at Campground #3 on Saturday
2/27.



So lets hear from you. Who is up for the challenge of a winter bus
campout??
