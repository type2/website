Subject: Stolen bus alert

Hey Folks,
Wanted to post an alert for a stolen bus. A Volkswagen double cab truck.
Vin# 103268   It was stolen from beside the owners house two days ago on the
15 of Feb.
The owner is Cory Houck who can be reached at 928-486-3349.
Further details and photos are available at the link shown below.

The vehicle has been seen once or twice in the southern California area in the
last 48 hours.
Like to ask those on the road or moving about to please keep an eye out for
it. (Photos are in the link
posted.)

All of us are at risk for this sort of thing, regardless if we drive
splitty's, bay's or Vanagons. Hopefully passing the word
among the larger Volkswagen community will help resolve this.
Also wanted to note, while reading about this theft, I learned of a new device
that may help limit or at least help in
recovering a stolen vehicle. I'm going to look into getting one for my bus.
Some of you may want to look into this also.

This device sends the location of your bus to your cell or computer. Check it
out! Several places sell this device including
Radio Shack.

Thank's any assistance!
