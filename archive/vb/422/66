Subject: Body Work Handbook was (RE: [T2] Welding)

Figured I'd copy this to the list as well as Bob was wanting a good recc for a
book for beginning body/paint work.
 
The one I recc and that started me (which I see cost $12.95 when I got it at
Waldenbooks circa 1985 or so) is:
 
Paint & Body Handbook by Don Taylor and Larry Hofer.
 
Mine is a 1984 HP Books publication.  It is a great book, written by I assume
a couple total hicks (not to knock them) as it reads that way, and as they are
painting a '64 Cuda in the driveway to illustrate technique, and are amazed at
the quality of the job at a local Maaco on an early 911 they go to watch. 
Anyway, my 1984 copy is quite dated, but still great if you found it for $3-4
somewhere online, it covers more gas welding less MIG as a MIG setup set you
back about $1500+ in 1980s money back then so wasn't done at home much (I
think I paid $800 for my first one in the early 90s at home and it was an OK
220V Century) similarly the paint lines described in my copy are quite dated,
but the techniques are timeless.  Anyway, there is a more current version
perhaps I should upgrade:
 
http://www.amazon.com/Paint-Body-Handbook-Don-Taylor/dp/1557880824/ref=sr_1_1
?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1266515933&sr=1-1
 
or
 
http://www.themotorbookstore.com/paint-body-handbook.html
 
but I have no idea what it is like, if the same as mine but updated, a good
short into read with all the techniques you need to get started right.  I
worked nights and weekends in a local body shop all through high school in the
late 80s with the knowledge and have done countless vehicles since.
