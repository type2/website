Subject: Re: [VB] front door seals

Those door seal photos are GREAT! That is exactly how the seals should be 
done. You don't see anyone installing them that way. Also note that in my 
bus, there was no factory glue holding in the seals ( I know because I've 
had my bus a veerry long time). The size of the rubber allowed for a slight 
squeeze fit into the channels. You might want to see if your seals fit 
without glue. Makes for easier replacement later on.
