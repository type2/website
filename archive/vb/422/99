" I've been happy with roofing tar as a sealant."
=========================================

What specific part number / type of Henry's tar should one purchase for 
windshield sealant?

Tried to Google "Henry's" and found they make lot's of stuff for roof's, 
much of it in
that famous "Blue can" mentioned in earlier posts. However, didn't find 
anything listed as "simple" roofing tar.

Closest products I could find include Henrys # 208 wet patch roof cement, # 
201 Asphault roof materiel,
# 275 some kind of clear materiel (couldn't read the label)

Noticed also the 3M product called out by someone,   WINDO-WELD, Resealant 
Black (flow grade) P/N 051135-08633
comes in pint cans and requires the 3M applicator gun P/N 051135-08994 which 
comes with two tips
one being; an all-purpose needle tip.

HMMM...Got me thinking, "all purpose needle tip? Is the Henrys tar only 
usefull when INSTALLING windows? What about if there's an
existing leak your trying to deal with? Will the tar work? and how do you 
work with it?

Just wonderin'
