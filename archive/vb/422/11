Military 181's came with crank starts.
I think all 181's had crank start slots in their rear bumpers.
I cut a hole in the rear tin of a 1600 I had in my 54 for a while.
A 1600 with good compression was hard to crank start.  A 36hp can 
usually be crank started within 2-3 tries.

How bout  crank start? Did you ever install a crank start on a 1600? I want
to do  that if it makes sense .. but if its stupid I won't  bother.

hey John They never made a rear tin for that for a 1500/1600 or even a 40  
ho that I know of.
