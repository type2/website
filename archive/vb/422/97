Subject: Re: [VB] windshield sealant

I've been happy with roofing tar as a sealant.

The windsheilds in my 65 westy started leaking about ten years after install.
I removed them to replace the seals and the glass, which had got cracks from
rocks over the years.    There was no rust under them.   I think the tar helps
against rust forming where water is trapped.

The seals we get now are not as well fitting as the OEM molded corner VW
seals.   I have installed a few NOS seals, and they practically installed
themselves.   It was really nice.  I am sure there was less of a leaking issue
with new VW seals than new repro seals.  The new molded corner seals don't
hold a candle to the NOS ones.

A thing to think about is where the people live who give advice about
windsheilds leaking.   I live in W Washington state, where it rains
frequently.   I also use a bus as a daily driver, so I drive around in the
rain frequently.  Someone who lives in an area that gets rain a few times a
year is going to have much less of a chance of leaky windsheilds.
