Sweet!

I sold the 65 westy with the manual choke in it a couple years ago.   It had
treated me right for some years, I was happy with it.
J dot Pickens installed the manual choke carb in a bus and is happy with it.
Last fall I installed the same carb in a 56 westy.   I didn't have the same
perky performance.  It wasn't any worse, though.  It needed some jetting
changes.  There was a distirbutor issue or something was going on.  I ended up
just putting the other carb back on as I was on a long road trip and didn't
feel like messing around with figuring stuff out at the time.

I've thought about crank start.   I cut the crank start flap out of a trashed
36hp rear tin, planning on stickiong it on a 1500 rear tin at some point.
 Other thing is the crank aprons (I think it's a stale air thing) are fatter,
and don't play so nicely with the 1600 engine, unless you leave out the rubber
seal.   Plus they don't have the factory notch for the tailpipe.   So maybe
it'd be better to modify a later apron for the crank hole.  ???
Anyhow, I never quite went there.

Crank starting can be fun once in a while.   But to tell the truth, it can get
real old.
