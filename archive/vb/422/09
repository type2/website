How bout  crank start? Did you ever install a crank start on a 1600? I want
to do  that if it makes sense .. but if its stupid I won't  bother.



hey John They never made a rear tin for that for a 1500/1600 or even a 40  
ho that I know of. Most of the rear tins I have are for 36 hp motors   .  I 
have some extra cranks and pulley nuts . but I don't have many of the  rear 
tin . You could cut it out and weld it to the 1600 rear tin or just cut a  
hole big enough for the crank to stick thu.  later mark  d
