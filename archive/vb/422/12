tow operators work to upright Gio Morrelli's 1966 VW van that flipped 
over during heavy rains on northbound Pacific Coast Highway in Newport 
Beach. "I was hanging upside down," Morrelli said. "I'm OK by the grace 
of God. I keep thinking it could have been so much worse."

Anyone know Gio? 

They say the worse (in terms of rain) is yet to come tomorrow.
