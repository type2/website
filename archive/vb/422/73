Lee,

The idea of the interior dome lights is very good and has a nice VW feel to 
it.
Easily available too. As I see it, 3 of them would be ideal, on the ceiling,
one each on the left, right and one center next to the lid. Those would
provide plenty of light for that rare night time side of the road work.

I do like the LED's. The glow is quite distinctive. I'm using a long throw
micro switch mounted in the upper right corner to activate the lights. If
anyone wants more info, let me know, I'll email a photo and part number.

All,

I added an interior dome light in the engine bay and run the power
straight from the batter.

I also used LED festoon bulbs in there and inside the bus - got them off
ebay.
