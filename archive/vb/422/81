Subject: Re: [VB] fresh air flap control?

Tough call Kevin,

First, congrats on having the paint done!!!  Any photos where we can view 
them? Are you taking photos of the work in progress?

Its been a few years since I had my fresh air flap assembly opened up. I 
seem to recall that the screws are where ever they need to be to position 
the handle at the top.

How does the handle attach?  Can it be loosened and rotated on the shaft? 
Can't remember, though I tighted mine up as it had been loose since about 
1966. My Dad always complained about it and even tried to take the system 
apart to tighten it up and only succeeded in having a cover that leaked in 
the rain. I did manage to disassemble it far enough to tighten the handle.
