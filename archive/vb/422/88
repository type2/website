Subject: Re: [VB] windshield sealant

Kevin,
When the restoration shop installed my windshields, they used some Henry's 
roofing tar. Comes in a blue can? at the local do-it-yourself home 
improvement store. Been in there now about 8 years with no effect on the 
rubber. Use in the glass grooves as well as the outside that goes against 
the window frame.

When installing the front windows  I've read in Bentley to use D10, Genuine
VW Window Cement. I know you guys on the list have recommended roofing tar.
Is there any issue with the tar reacting with the rubber?

 

Do you just put the tar on the body where the seal goes? Or do you need
sealant between the glass and the rubber seal?

 

Also do you need any type of sealant when installing the rear glass?
