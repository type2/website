I find the "restricted" top end part of that statement is relative..   I
used to race a 1/4 mile dirt oval with a 62 beetle. the rules were stock
sedan..  I ran an 1835 with a C35 cam ... a single port 1600 intake and
carb....   now, the carb was tickled a little with a die grinder, some sand
paper, and the choke removed... but that car smoked the R22 Toyota Corolla..
looking at the engine.. it appeared to be a STOCK 1600 single port engine..
I could out race them off the green flag,, and pull away down the straights
.

I guess in comparison..  if i was running dual port heads, and intake.. I
might have had a few more "go" at top end.

The trans had a close ratio 3rd, and 4th,, so when I was in "4th".. it was
actually a stock 3rd gear.
