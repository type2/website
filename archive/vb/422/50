Subject: wide 5 wheels on a 71

posted this on samba, wondered if any of the pontiffs on the list had any
ideas

ok, I've never seen anyone ask this before. How would you convert the small
5 wheel pattern on a 71 to the earlier style wide 5 wheels.

Why you ask, cuz I've run into a cheap '71 but really wanted to use 5-star
off road wheels on my next bay. I wanted the extra height of a 15" wheel,
and steel wheels bend not break on logging roads.

Any ideas?
thx
Chuck
