 Hi Kevin,
No reaction with the rubber in the over fifteen years we have been using it.

If you are using laminate glass, having sealant there keeps the water from
attacking it and turning white.

As for the rear window, it helps to keep the seal working longer and keeping
out any rust.

Had twenty years ago a leaky rear seal when we got our 1960 walk thru panel
camper conversion, and badly rusted lower windshield areas.  New rear seal
kept out the water for 18 years, but then began to leak.  Was able to reseal
it with roofing tar and two years later it has stayed sealed.
