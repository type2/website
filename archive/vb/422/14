Subject: Re: [VB] '66 Bus Flipped on Freeway - Front page LA Times

Theres a complete run down on this accident on the Samba site. (split bus 
forum)
The fellow driving the bus tells the story.
It's interesting that he comments that although his bus suffered damage
it was damaged even more when the tow crew flipped it back over.

 <http://www.latimes.com/topic/us/california/orange-county-%28california%29/newport-beach-PLGEO100101018611181.topic> tow operators work to upright Gio Morrelli's 1966 VW van that flipped over during heavy rains on northbound Pacific Coast Highway in Newport Beach. "I was hanging upside down," Morrelli said. "I'm OK by the grace of God. I keep thinking it could have been so much worse." Anyone know Gio? They say the worse (in terms of rain) is yet to come tomorrow. Scott '60 DC
