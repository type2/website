Subject: Oil Bath Air Cleaner ... and bracket ... 

I went to put my oil bath air cleaner on my 60 today and it appears not to
fit . that is, I have a bracket I picked up from a 62 at a wrecker . it fits
right on the spot on the fan shroud . but the air cleaner doesn't bolt on ..
The hole on the tab on the arm of the air cleaner just misses the hole on
the bracket . I wonder what's wrong? Could the bracket have changed between
60 and 62? Could the fan shroud on a 1600 be factionally narrower than the
fan shroud on a 1200? Is it possible that my oil bath air cleaner is wrong .
hmmm ...
