About 7 years ago Steve stepped up and helped me ship a bus from near to 
him to the UK. Not many people would do this for someone they didn't 
know. Then I even gave him more to do by having eBay stuff sent to his 
house to load into the bus. He only grumbled a bit ;-) RIP Steve.

Lee (long time listy from the UK)
