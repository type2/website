Subject: idle cam adjuster?

Trying to adjust the idle on my bus. There is the stepped cam thing on the
side of the carb. Mine feels really sloppy-like it is missing a cushing in
the center of it. I've got another carb, where this feels really snug. This
2nd carb needs a rebuild, as the gaskets on it are leaking. I thought I
could take this stepped cam off one carb and swap it with the other. When I
undo the nut that holds the cam on-the cam does not seem to come off easily,
or rather it doesn't want to come off at all. I've tried both. It seems
really stuck on there. I don't want to force it and break something. Is this
supposed to come off? Does it matter that the one on there is sloppy?
