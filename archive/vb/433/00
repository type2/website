I've found that the wire is very brittle and a very small very sharp 
chisel can often break it up into many small pieces which can be worried 
out with again a very small screwdriver or hemostat.

I would save the acid for the last resort, I've used that stuff and it is 
just too easy to get it where it doesn't belong.  I use a full body suit 
and face mask when I use it.

YMMV
