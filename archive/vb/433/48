 And the cost of shipping or traveling the 500 miles to get the early gate
will be nothing??  Plus once you have the gate almost certainly you will just
find the rust inside is just about to make holes in the same frame area.


Another way to skin this cat would be to see if there are any sheet metal
shops or machine shop with a brake press in your neck of the woods and have
them cut and bend the pieces you need.  Preferably with a zinc coating.  Then
use a proper filter mask when you weld on it.

As for dimensions they are the same.  Differences in the rear gates is the
rectangle dimpled areas in the hinge locations and the taillight holes.  Gate
latches are a bit different, but work the same.
Later side gates are longer.
