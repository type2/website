I'll look into that Kopr-Shield stuff that you mention, is this usually
available at my FLAPS? I'm not sure what the inner connection is, as I can't
see it. Where exactly do you apply this stuff, at spade and ring connectors?

As for two nuts-yes there are two nuts on the bolt. Although when I compare
to the alternator in my '69 single cab (installed by PO) I only see one nut,
I guess I'll add another one to that.
