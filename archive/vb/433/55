It is likely that looseness, corrosion or dirt caused the plastic 
insulator to start melting the first time. My concern is that now the 
plastic has melted some and if the internal connection is not welded 
(that is, it may just be another ring terminal on the bolt like the 
outside one is) then that internal connection may continue to heat up 
due to molten plastic having contaminated the connection.

You could check it for warming when you run high load (all lights on 
with the engine running) and if the connection gets warm when the 
outer connection is good then I would take the alternator apart 
enough to inspect and clean the internal connection on that bolt.

I often use a tiny amount of Kopr-Shield on high current connections, 
it does wonders to keep them low resistance (well connected) but 
should be used sparingly since it does conduct and so should be kept 
off the insulating parts.
