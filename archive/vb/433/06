 From the archives:


Up to 1960 there was a wire bracket bolted to the front left side of
the tranny to prevent this.  1961 and later there was a boden like tube for
the accelerator cable.  We bought some of these tubes for later bug (111 721
551 is the listed bus manual part for this, and mentions needing to shorten
it to 670mm, but in our experience it should be 760mm instead.) and had to
shorten them about 1/4" after carefully slipping off one crimped on end and
replacing it after the shortening.
