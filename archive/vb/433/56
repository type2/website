Subject: Re: [VB] Alternator B+ Stud

you have two nuts on that, right?
  The wire to the b+  where it is at the alternator should have a nut
above it
and
a nut
below it.


the bottom nut holds the stud that sticks out in place, the second nut holds
the wire in place.

IIRC

6V generator -  to 12V alternator  withhelp from you all. Thanks. The issue
I'm running into is the stud on the alternator that is labeled B+.I have
tightened the nut on it a few times, and it keeps loosening up....
