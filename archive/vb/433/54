Subject: EZ-Camper interior panels-FREE to any decent VW citizen

Well time to clean out my garage.I need more space. I have some old panels
from my '65 ez-camper. These are not in great condition, but if someone in
the Boston, Massachusetts area wants to come pick them up-they are welcome
to them.

 

These include the roof panels, and maybe some door and trim panels. I would
not recommend installing these, but they would be good to use as a pattern.
I have already done a fairly decent set of drawings of them.some are posted
on vintagebus.com. I used these to make the new panels in my bus.

 

Anyway-if you want them please let me know ASAP. I'm in a cleaning mood,
hate to see this stuff go in the trash, but I have no use for them now, and
don't think I ever will.not sure how long I will keep them around.
