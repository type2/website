Subject: Distributor drive gear backlash

Hi,
I've been wondering for a while about what appeared to be shaky 
timing. ie, timing is never stable when I look at it with my timing 
light. Always bobbling around +/- 2-3 degrees.

I have a type 1 engine.
I pulled the distributor today and with a screwdriver I can rotate the 
drive gear shaft a couple of degrees back and forth. The spring is not 
missing. It is properly in place. Pressing down on the shaft does not 
reduce the lash.

Are there some spacer washers under the shaft that could be 
removed/adjusted to allow the drive gear to better engage the 
crankshaft gear?

Can the drive shaft be pulled up out of the case without splitting the 
case?
How can this be done?

Thanks,
Chris
