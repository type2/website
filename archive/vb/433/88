Hi William,

Best to measure the fan and not to "Think" it is correct.

J-tubes should work OK if you run the engine tin for/with them.  Heat
exchangers are better all around though...

160 thru 220 F is the range we have found works for us.  230F and higher is
just too hot.  Personally prefer Castrol 30 Wt. during warm weather due to not
breaking down as multiweight oil will, and 10/30 in weather that is rarely
going to get above 70F and easily down below freezing.

Running the engine at too high of RPM or too low will cause overheating
problems.  Generally you want to stay between 1,500 and 3,000 RPM (1st can go
lower RPM, but even then you want to get up in RPMs sooner than later), only
going above 3,000 RPM for short bursts when up shifting so you do not end up
below 1,500 RPM in the higher gear, especially going up hill.

E&B

I recently pulled the motor to address an oil cooler leak so I don't think
there
was any debris in the fan shroud.  Starts right up and runs smoothly after it
warms up a bit.  It did sit for a couple of years until recently.

What should the proper oil temperature be?? I might invest in a temp gauge...I
think the fan is ok as is all the tins.. I do have J tubes installed, if that
matters.  Hard to figure out as it runs so well then gets hot and stalls
out.....
