It's not likely to be at your FLAPS as far as I know. 8oz is a 
lifetime supply. I got it from McMaster long ago. I see it's 
available on the web from a few vendors when I google it.

I'd do the check for how warm it gets before complicating things by 
finding the inner connection. Usually such things have to be 
disassembled to get to the inner connections, a pain but better than 
buying a new one.

Make sure the lower nut is tight before you attache the wire and the 
upper nut since the lower nut tightens the internal connection.
