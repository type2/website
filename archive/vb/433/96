Subject: Hard Shifting

My '69 has recently (in the last couple days) become really hard to shift.
Just putting it in first from a stop-is very difficult, it almost feels like
something is not meshing correctly?

 

I replaced a shift rod bushing on my '65 a long time ago-and I can't recall
what the symptoms which led me to finding a split bushing. Could this be the
same thing, on a different vehicle?

 

Suggestions on diagnosing the problem would be appreciated.

 

Thanks,
