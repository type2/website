Subject: Fwd: [VB] oil leak

What oil passages size the cooler has?

If passages are same size as engine you do not use the spacer washers.

Bottom of this website has cooler seal info:

Where the bracket mounts on the block, should there be washers over the
mounting bolts to "even up" the distance for the red seals??
