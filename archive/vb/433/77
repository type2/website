Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor drive gear backlash

Hi,

Thanks for the advice. I did manage to remove the dizzy gear, after I 
also removed the fuel pump, the push rod and the plastic pump mount. 
My alternator and intake manifold were also a little close but I was 
able to give those a push and lift off the pump.

As for the backlash, the dizzy gear slides down parallel to the crank 
gear, the only way to improve the backlash would be to reduce the 
center to center distance between the gears. The only way I can see to 
do this would be to put either the dizzy gear or the crank gear into a 
plating tank and plate up a few thousandths of an inch of metal. Not 
going to do this today or any time soon. Maybe I'll move ahead with my 
wish to add fuel injection and a fully distributorless ignition.
