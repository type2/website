Subject: Re: [VB] hot running motor

I just got a new to me 55 truck.   Taking a look at the motor I noticed that
there are gaps where the fresh air tubes connect to the muffler.   This just
lets air bypass the cooling system.   :(
I need to do a tune up and check up and  make sure all those connections are
good.

I tend not to have a problem with running hot.   I also like to have all the
tins in place.  Thistruck is missing the apron.    Maybe I should install a
temp guage, drive around, THEN fix the stuff I like to fix, and see if it
makes a difference.

Just got warm (out of the sixties into the eighties) the last couple days.
Last week I really didn't think I could possibly overheat  just putting 5
miles here and there.   Now I'm thinking it could be an issue.

:)

oh... how hot is 'very hot'?
does it boil when you spit on the base of the engine stand?
