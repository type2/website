Subject: RE:Throttle Cable - Guide Tube Through Fan

For the accelerator cable rubbing against the tranny housing I got some hose
from a local place that does work on big trucks(think 18 wheelers). I think
it was an air hose for brake lines? Someone suggested it to me on the list a
long time ago. It is like a stiff plastic tube that is a little bigger than
the accelerator cable. It has lasted a long time, and seems to be doing its
job. I think they either gave it to me for free, or it was just a couple
bucks.
