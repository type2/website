Subject: Re: idle cam adjuster?

Was writ:

"Missing a bushing instead of a cushing?"

 

Sorry for the typo.greasy fingers on the keyboard. I'll try to wiggle it
off. The rolled pin is in both carbs. I am following the instructions on
adjusting the carb, and the cam is so loose that it is hard to adjust the
Fast Idle Adjuster, as the cam moves all over the place.

 

Thanks for the tip.
