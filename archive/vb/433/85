Hi Willi keep the list going. http://www.type2.com/donate.html am,
Would first invest in an oil temp and pressure gauges.  Also a meat or candy
thermometer that has probe as long as the dipstick for making sure the oil
temp gauge is reading correctly.

Make sure the cooling fan is 33, 34, or best 35 mm width, and not earlier
thinner fan.  Also that you are using DH crankshaft pulley and not earlier
smaller one.  Plus ALL seals and engine tins are in place.  Engine tuned
properly.

Other thing to check would be that the cooling fan does not have any junk in
it like a piece of paper or rag.  If type 1 make sure the engine firewall
insulation is not coming loose and covering the fan opening.  Did VW sit for a
while?  Could be the shroud is full of wasp or mouse trash....
