Subject: Engine issue

Started an motor that was rebuilt a couple of years ago and then sat for a
couple of years.  1600 DP

Severe oil leak left side.  Literally runs down the left side of the block
above the push rod tubes.

Leaking oil cooler??  Can't think of anywhere else all that oil would be
coming from.
