Subject: RE: Steve Dolan passed away on June 7

I am so sad to hear this news. Steve was a kind and fascinating person who
had his own unique take on the world. I fondly remember the many
conversations we had that would start off about Buses and veer into
philosophy, religion, you name it. Years later I would find myself quoting
him.  I am a better person for having known him.
