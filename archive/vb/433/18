I'll miss him. Last time he called about some pet related thing (do
not recall what), we talked for a very long time. That is how it
always was when we talked.

He stayed here a few days with Nickie (? do not remember her name)
when we put his cat back together, and he left with an x-ray machine
to look for fossils. Seemed typical. :-)

Never will forget the piercing eyes. I feel sad today, but should be
happy to have shared a bit of life with him.

RIP Steve
