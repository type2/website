Subject: Re: [T2] Mysterious fuel delivery issue

Here is another twist on the problem.
I've had my bus now for 40 years. Driven in all kinds of hot weather 
with nary a vapor lock.

A few years back I replaced the stock steel line that travels from the 
pump thru the firewall with a nice looking stainless steel line. The 
inside diameter is slightly smaller than that of the stock steel tube. 
I once drove from L.A. to Northern California in June with 
temperatures north of 90F. Stopped at a McD's for a bite and when we 
came out, it ran as far as the driveway and died. Must have used up 
the fuel in the bowl. Once cooled down, it started right up. Later on 
the return trip, temps over 102 in Paso Robles where I was smart 
enough not to shut off the engine. Almost vapor locked when I tried to 
get back onto the freeway, engine stumbled like it was running low on 
fuel.

Lesson here is, use the stock steel line, or a rubber tube large 
enough so the fuel won't vaporize in the line.
I'm guessing that there is a trade off in fuel flow and speed and 
volume that VW either researched and settled on the line they used, or 
they hit a sweet spot by dumb luck.

BTW, I'm still using the original factory installed fuel pump. 312,000 
miles. No, the motor is not original, just the fuel pump.
