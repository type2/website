Subject: Fresh air flap lubrication

Hi Guys,

 

I replaced the seals on the fresh air vent over the front seats on my '65.
The seal on the flap that lets the air in, and the seal on the one that
directs the air. They work great-super tight. Unfortunately a  bit too
tight. I feel like I am going to break the handle when I try to turn the
diverter. I was thinking of greasing this-but was not sure what grease to
use. Would a lithium spray grease work, Teflon dry lube, or a silicone type
grease or a wheel bearing type universal grease? I was a little concerned
about any sort of lubricant eating the rubber seal.

 

Thanks for any tips on this.
