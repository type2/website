I did see his basement during the period where he was trying to "purge"
some of the items he wasn't using.  I believe he had an air cooled Vanagon
he was trying to "give" away.  IIRC, he had a nice 1968 bay (green?) with
the small pop-top and SO-44(?) interior.  I love that combination; it was a
sweet bus.

I picked up a fridge and gas heater, and then he asked me to drive him
somewhere to pick up the above mentioned bus (after hitting the bank to get
some $).  Naturally, I obliged.  I only met him in person the one time, but
he was quite a character.
