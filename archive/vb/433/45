Subject: Split/Bay Single Cab gate interchange?

Subject says it pretty much, do they?  I'm not concerned about exact details
like not having the tailight cutouts in the rear gate, or the little hinge
reliefs.  Just want to know if a set of split side gates (probably 64ish) can
bolt onto a '69.  Or for that matter if they are close enough to help rework
the '69 gates.  Obviously these don't come up in AK every day, so I need to
make a move on them if they help me.  Bases of mine are pretty perforated,
these are reputed not to be, but are 500 miles from me and I need to know what
I can do with them.
 
Thanks
John
