Subject: CQ CQ CQ, calling all hams going to BBBVI!

That's amateur radio operators, not bad actors!

Scott, KN6F and George, N7TN are setting up a special event station (call
sign W7V) at Buses By the Bridge VII.  The goal is to make contacts with
the worldwide amateur radio community and to generally spread the VW
goodwill!

This is the first year for this operation, so we're kind of feeling out
way along.  We're putting out a QST for all hams who would like to help.
All classes of operators are welcome!

Please contact me via email if you would like to help!

At the event, You can't miss us, look for the extension ladder antenna
mast!
