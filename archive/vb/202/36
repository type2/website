Subject: RE: [VB] Weekend salvage yard experience

i have been thinking of starting a kinda of junkyard/storage co-op with my
local VW club and other vw fans. the idea would be the members pay a small
fee each month to have a place to store there VW's that they find and have
no room to store it,work on them , strip them what ever. What do you guys
think? would it work?
later Ian in Va

Agree, Vee Dub has no conscious at times.  Sure it's a business but Glen in
used parts told me last month,(when a nice little '66 Kombi came in) that
'we can make 10 times more money parting it out than selling it whole.'  So
this past weekend, the little Bus was out there, no motor, one door missing,
other doors open, front seats thrown on the ground around it, full of rain
water, starting down the path to becoming molten metal again.  I wish I had
a place with a big old pole barn and I could just stuff it full of Buses...
