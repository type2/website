True, but it's a whole lot easier to regulate one smoke stack than it is
100,000 tail pipes.

Hydrogen can be produced using solar energy and storage is similar to
propane or LPG.  The fuel cells may not be the answer, but much closer than
burning fossel fuels.  Some fuel cells are being used to generate power from
the methane produced in land fills.

I've thought about our busses and what we will have to do in the future to
power them, after all, this fuel we use know is going to run out someday.
Of course here in the midwest, we are sitting on a huge fuel reserve,
alcohol made from corn starks.  And burning alcohol will just mean a change
of carb, nothing else.  We can produce alcohol cheaper than we can produce
gasoline, but as long as the fuel companies keep a strangle hold on
congress, we won't see the large alcohol fuel refineries needed to make the
change.  After all, the oil companies can't make as much money.

Back in the 70's I started the paper work to make an alcohol fuel still, but
you wouldn't believe the hoops you have to jump through just to make your
own fuel brew.  Not to mention the tax which at the time was $1.50 a gallon
if you were going to use it on the road!!  Of course we could have just used
it on the farm with no tax, but couldn't drive any roads which was crazy.
