Kevin, sorry I didn't get back to you quicker, I've been pretty busy with
heater repairs.

The South Wind gasoline heaters were made by Stewart Warner who still makes
gas heaters for 18 wheelers, aircraft and the military.  Go to:

As far as how the VW style South Wind heaters work, what they look like and
how much "modification" you have to do to your bus, there is a partial
scanned factory manual that may answer some of your questions at:

Hope this helps, if you have any more questions, feel free to pmail me.  I
will have to say this, a working gas heater in a bus does increase it's
value, unless you're selling it in S. Cal., but even the those folks like to
do a little driving in the mountains, how about that freeze your nuggies off
Mount Shasta trip!!
