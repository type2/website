The Bus under discussion ( http://www.austinev.org/evalbum/384.html )
has 12 batteries, rated at 210 Ah / 20 hr (a steady 10.5 A draw).  When
used as traction batteries they will give less capacity; Concorde says
they will last 6.5 hr at a steady 25 amp draw, which is a 163 Ah rating.
When fully charged they have a nominal capacity of 25.2 KWh (20 hr rate)
or 23.4 KWh (6.5 hr rate).  The 49-mile range is given at an 80% discharge,
so you'll only use around 20.2 (18.7) KWh to go that distance.

Let's assume you want to double the range to 98 miles.  If your average
speed is 30 mph, that means you are traveling for 3 hours and 16 minutes.
For half of that, you can run on batteries alone, and for the second
half, you need a generator that can put out as much as the batteries
can.  So, you'll need a generator that can deliver 20.2 (18.7) KWh over
a period of 1 h 38 m, which means you need a 12.3 (11.4) kW generator,
which is a generator rated at least 16.5 (15.3) hp.  If your average
speed is 60 mph, you'll need twice as much: a 24.6 (22.8) kW generator,
which needs at least 33 (31) hp.

A quick look around the 'net shows a Honda 11 kW generator (325 lbs
dry) selling for $2175.  A John Deere 22 kW generator (1671 lbs dry)
is a bargain at $6425.

Ronnie sells a 1600 longblock (around 250 lbs dry) for $1450.  When
dressed up, it will make 60 hp or so, and give you about a 200 mile
range with a 10-gallon tank.

Ya ever get the impression that Messrs. Porsche, Daimler, Benz, Ford,
Toyoda, et al, knew what they were doing when they chose internal
combustion?  :)

Don't get me wrong - I think EVs are good for some applications, like
the one under discussion, commuting.  But some fundamental engineering
constraints say that you can't build a pure battery-electric vehicle
that will have the same performance as a comparable IC-engine vehicle.
Among other things, this means that if you ever want to take long trips,
you have to own two cars: an EV and an IC.

A hybrid-electric Bus would be interesting.  You could do extensive
hacking to the body and put in a Prius or Civic Hybrid powertrain,
or do less extensive hacking to the body and engine/transmission and
add an electric motor to the left of the engine.  This would buy you
anywhere from 25% to 50% better mileage than stock - probably closer
to the low end of that range.  One good way to exploit a hybrid
powertrain in a Bus would be to put in a super "freeway flyer"
transmission to keep the engine revs at 3K (-at-) 75 MPH.  You'd lose
low-end grunt from the engine but the electric motor could easily
make up for that -- Toyota says the electric motor in my Prius makes
258 lb-ft at 0 to 400 rpm.

Even with all of this nifty technology, something written in 1969 or
so still holds true for most stocker air-cooled VWs:

"The best anti-smog devices for the Volkswagen are neither gimmicks
 nor laws; they are humans who keep their cars in good shape, the
 compression around one hundred, in good tune and who drive so they
 never accelerate or decelerate rapidly."  (Muir, Idiot manual)

A friend of mine has mentioned that his stock '65 Mustang, with new
plugs and tuned up to original spec, met the 1989 49-state emissions
requirements.  When the plugs were 2 years old, it only met the '86
49-state specs.
