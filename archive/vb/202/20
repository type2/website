Subject: black cat & southwind& more  heater ?s

black cat
sounds like a couple of you are using these things...what do you think? do
you recommend them? How often do you use them-just on longer road trips over
30 minutes....do they warm the whole bus, or just small areas? where do you
place it, how prone are they to tipping while driving around? I don't have a
walk-thru, could i put it on the front floor? or would it melt my floor mat,
or preclude me from having any front seat passengers? do you leave a window
open the whol time-how open, just a crack?I am imagineing driving with my
heat catching fire, but a real nice cold breeze coming in the window ;)

southwind heater?
as for the southwind heater...sounds great, but i assume these are NLA, and
can only be found used. i don't y=understand how these auxilary heaters
work. Do they tap into the existing gas tank, or do they have their own gas
tank? How do you start them? does the voltage of your bus affect them? I
have a 6V, and have seen heaters for sale but don't understand how i would
hook them up. I am interested, but I wouldn't want to make any major mods to
my bus(ie cutting holes in the body)

other heaters?
what about the stewart warner heaters? anyone running one of these? I have
seen a 6v for sale on ebay(good for me as i have a 6v bus) but it says it
has no control cable, are these things somewhat standard? ie do i need to
make sure it is for a '65 bus, or just make sure it is for a volkswagen? and
how hard is it to add a control cable?

thanks for any suggestions, or website links to find info on this stuff.
