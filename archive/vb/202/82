Subject: Headlight buckets

Howdy.

Dismantled the headlights last night on my '66 Deluxe.  Very interesting
engineering at work there, I love these things.  Anyway, what color should
the inside of the headlight 'bucket' area be painted.  Mine looks like it
was primered grey at one time, and bits of that are now peeling off so it
needs to be re-done.

Thanks
