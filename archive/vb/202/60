  You could ride down with the guy from Sac who's picking up the wheels (did
he contact you?). There is a hotel right at the entrance to the show so you

C'mon Thom! You can do it! We'll save a spot for you on the quiet side o' 
camp. Deliver them and I'll set you up with all the hotdogs you can eat!
