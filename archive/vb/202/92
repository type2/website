Subject: RE: [VB] re:vintage EV bus... biofuels

One of the problems with biofuels are that the btu content and other
properties vary widely from their different sources.  For large consumers
such as McDs, they can funnel all their used french fry oil into a
processing plant and obtain a fairly consistent product but this is not the
norm.  One article I read stated that because of the wide variation of end
products, the biggest problem they were having was adjusting the engine
timing according to the blend that was being fueled at any time.  Think of
it as one time you find yourself buying 73 octane at the pump and the next
station has 92.

Now, to solve this problem, what they really need is a small reliable
spectrophotometer system inline to non-destructively measure the energy
content of said fuel as it goes to the injectors.  This info is then fed
into the control computer and the engine parameters adjusted accordingly.
Now, since my little company builds such a devise, all I need is an in-road
to the right people..... but I digress....
