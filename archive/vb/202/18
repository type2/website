Some people think riding motorcycles and jumping out of airplanes is safe,
it's all relative, you just have to be around a gas heater to understand how
safe these heaters really are.

They've put millions of these gas heaters in cars, tanks, army vehicles and
airplanes.  I know people are scared of them, but from the day I started
working on them in 1974 I have yet to come accross one that has burned on
it's own.  Now I sure can't say that about our VW's!!!

Some people even call us bus pilots crazy for riding in those "death traps".
Believe me, the gas heaters are safe, it's all in people's minds, not in the
facts.  I wish everyone of the skeptics could enjoy a nice warm ride on a
really bone chilling day, no better way to quench the fears.
