Considering that most of the electricity that would charge the battery in
a Lead/Acid EV is generated by coal, fuel oil or GASP atomic energy aren't
they really just adding additional energy overhead and shifting the
location of the pollution? Even fuel cells, the pie in the sky savior,
will require the development of a huge infrastructure for producing and
delivering the fuel cell fuel. Many of the best FC systems seem to lean
towards methanol based fuels because hydrogen FC have severe storage and
delivery safety problems to overcome. Today in Nebraska it is 10F and
snow. Batteries are terrible in cold weather and the need to heat the
interior of an automobile would drain the battery even worse. I still say
we have a long way to go before we find a viable alternative
