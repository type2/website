If the heater is inside the bus you need to cut a hole for the exhaust to
exit.  The stock location for a Southwind is opposite the battery in your
aux battery location and you need to exhaust the heater out the bottom there
too.  Just cut a small exhaust hole where the heater sits and let the
exhaust tube run out it.  Again the propane exhausts lots of water vapor and
would not be good for driving as you would have to scrape the inside of the
bus as the vapor would freeze to the inside   The procat has a tank that
fits inside.   Zodi has a heater in a box that might be good for stationary
camping as it is designed for a tent but could be made to use in a bus but
you still have the water vapor problem  http://www.zodi.com/hotvents.html
Here is another with a shower too  http://www.zodi.com/combo.html
