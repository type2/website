Terrance,

[Transfer of pollution, fuel cell infrastructure]

Right on, right on.  BUT, efficient western coal-fired electric
generation plants now burn purty clean, I think you'd get overall
cleaner air if you could go with coal-fired electricity in EV's.  But of
course in X no. of years we will run out of coal.  At least it is a
national resource that is relatively more plentiful.  The most efficient
solar cells produce 20-22% of the potential retrievable energy.  That is
an area worth pursuing too, but of course it leads back to the storage
problem.

Till then, the Air-cooled ICE is it, along with a FEW water-coolers
too.  (heh,heh,heh)  But from what I have heard, you are right, fuel
cells are the future, but they have problems to solve including infrastructure
you allude to.  Probably the wisest course is to pursue ALL forms of
alternative energy and electrical production--small dams for hydro, coal,
wind, etc., etc, but not nuclear.

Best,

Curt
