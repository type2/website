can plug in at work,for free!  A recharge takes three and a half hours, or
less for a partial charge (faster chargers are available but pricey).  I'm
currently working on a compact propane fired aux. power unit for the

the garage when not needed.  The bus has been on the road for about a year
and working very well.  BTW, Matt, I used your 6v to 12v conversion
information from the web; worked great, thanks.
