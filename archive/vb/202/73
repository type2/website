Subject: Non Vanagon, Non Westy Content FS Porsche 912e 1976

A friend is offering his Porsche 912e coupe for sale.
Here is info that I have so far.
Year 1976, Model 912e, Texas No Rust Car, 58,000 original miles, one
owner since new.
New Michelin tires on Porsche Alloys.
Vinyl OEM seats.
He says it had a 911 Clutch installed at about 11,000 miles when it was
still under warranty.
Color Metallic Brown. It needs a paint job even though it was garaged. It
sat at open airport parking when he worked.
He is a retired Airline Pilot currently retired at Lake Bridgeport TX (80
miles West of Dallas).
To the best of my knowledge this car has had the very best of care
through Dallas area dealerships and most recently by Zimms Porsche
(independent) for a minor tune up.
His asking price is $7500.00
The car is currently stored inside in Dallas, near Love Field Airport
(not sure but most likely in a hanger at Love Field).
I don't currently have pictures but will have some next week to post.
