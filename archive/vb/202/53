No need to cut any of the bus, or bug sheet metal, with an upright kit, they
fit in the stock engine bay.  If you want to sell your vehicle, but not your
type 4, just remove it and put in an underpowered type 1 and your stock
again.  

The upright type 4's even use the stock rubber engine seal.  That's what
sold me on the type 4's, nothing to cut, the vehicle is still untouched,
just a bit more "spunky" and a lot more miles between engine rebuilds.
