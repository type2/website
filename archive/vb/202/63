FWIW, depending on the kind of tranny, there are two kinds of clutchs.  the 
pad is the same but the later clutch doesn't have the central circle on it.   

I recommend the idiot book too for your first engine pull.  It has useful 
tips for non experts like label where each wire goes.  You can write notes on 
it as well

Recommend replacing any engine seals (oil cooler, main seals) engine to body 
seals, grommets for fuel line or battery cables, get new fuel line, while the 
engine is out.  make sure clutch adjustment wingnut spins easily.   clean 
connections at starter.

 There is http://www.type2.com/library/drivetra/kuhn5.htm in the Library.
 When Dad and I changed his clutch, we used the Idiot manual and the
 Bentley.
