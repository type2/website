The thing I don't get about this whole hybrid / elctric car thing is
battery life is about 4-5 yrs. Once we end up with all of these old dead
batteries laying around, what do we do with them? Am I missing something
here? All that lead going into landfills would be as bad as any
emissions we have. Can they reuse them? I like the biodiesel idea. The
technology is here now. As far as I know there is 0 bad emissions and
there are some really cool turbo diesel motors that produce huge amounts
of torque. Perfect for a bus.
just my rambling,

ps - I do like that rig though.
