Subject: Oil Change

Hey Everyone,

I have a standard 679 with a recently rebuilt engine (done by the PO). The
rebuild was done well and the engine is sealed tight. I recently changed the
oil and began to notice a drop or two of oil when I park my bus. I can9t
help but think that maybe I did something wrong when I changed the oil. It
was the first time that I have changed it on a bus with the oil screen (my
729 has a standard oil filter). I used a new oil change kit from my local VW
parts house; copper washers and cork like seals. My question is about the
seals, I used them dry. Should I have done something different? Should I
have used some sort of additional sealant? I really hate to see my beautiful
bus leak oil and would appreciate any help you guys might be able to offer.

Thanks for your time,
Tom May
