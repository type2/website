I use a ProCat heater, which is the same thing as a BlackCat except in a
fancy housing with a small fan.

It puts out 3000BTU/h which translates to about 800W in electric heater
terms.  This is about half of what a portable electric heater puts out.
Don't expect it to instantly warm the interior of the bus but if you give
it time it will make it quite warm.

Handy hints:
Before you use it, fire it up and let it run for an hour or so outside to
burn off the paint smell.  They aren't normally smelly, but when they are
new they will stink up the place.

The backpacker version (1200BTU/h) is probably a bit small for a bus.

The BlackCat heaters come in "matchlight" or piezo ignition versions.  The
ones you find at Wallyworld will be the cheaper matchlight version unless
you get the fancy ProCat.  The piezo version is much easier to light.

You need a bit of venting.  Leaving a wing window cracked is fine.

It will produce water vapor.  Expect steamy windows unless you provide
airflow.

I put it just behind the driver's seat pointing aft.  With the middle seat
in I would put it in the walkthrough.  The heat is somewhat radiant, but
it doesn't seem to heat the surfaces more than a foot away all that much.
