I'm not really sure what message you are replying to, the South Winds ARE
wonderful!!  Nothing better to heat a bus with.  The Eberspachers are nice,
but the South Winds put out more BTU's and cubic feet per minute of warm dry
clean air!!

Not only are the gas heaters nice, with an RV thermostat, you can keep the
bus the same temps all the time.  Turn the heater on in the morning before
leaving for work and the bus will be warm when you come out to start it up.
Not to mention, all the frost on the windows will be gone too, both inside
and out!!
