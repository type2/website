Yes, you need to run exhaust out, mount to the driver side in engine
bay, some later bay heater have intake from the cabin to recirc the air.
You need to cut your bus by the rear wheel well to put heat inside,
straight through the 'spare battery' tray for exhuast, a hole in fwall
for gas line, and then the bowden (find one!) for the control knob up
front under you legs.

I use the Mr heater,available for 89.00 from sportsmans guide 9,000 btu,
no electrics, uses a 16oz disposable (you can refill these with
paintball refill equipment), or a 20 lb with hose attachment for
camping. It has holes on the back with slots to mount, which alot of the
bay windows guys mount them to the back of the seat bulkheads. I am
making a contraption to hold a 5-10 lb tank, and mount the heater inside
with the front sticking out and have a 12v fan to blow it around. This
heater has low 02 shut off to avoid killing you.

Propane sucks due to water vapor. Venting is a good idea, and vapour
barriers behind the panels to protect the bus insides.....
