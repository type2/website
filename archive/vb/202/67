It looks better than most of the 10k buses I see for
sale, that's for sure! It's too bad the distance was a
little better though. I don't think I know any one who
drives much less than 50 miles one way to work.
All you need now is a hitch so you can pull a trailer
with a few good sized generators whose pulleys have
belts connected to the trailer wheel(s)or axle so you
can drive that bus anywhere! :)
