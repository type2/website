Yes, it does not use any battery power to operate.  Instead it uses the
power that would normally be lost as brake heat.  Very useful in the city,
on the hwy I open the safari's .  The only battery power used is to operate
the blower motor.  In 80 deg weather is puts out 40-45 deg from the vents.
Virually no drop in mileage range as the blower is powered by the aux
battery which powers the 12v items
