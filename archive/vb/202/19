No problem, just couldn't figure out what email you were refering to.  It
used to be easy to find parts for these heaters, but a few years ago the
supply kind of ran out, so I got with the company and started handling the
parts myself in order to have what I needed when I worked on my own.

If you find a good heater, I have all the tune up parts for the South Winds
at:

I also have NOS factory manuals that aren't listed.

Just like our busses, these heaters take a little service now and then, but
will give you years of heat if you take the time to treat them right.
