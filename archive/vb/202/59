Whatever happened to Dave Heard, Eric the hand, the Bus Farmers, the Red Barn
crowd, Some of the old CCC whack pack and the Oregon crowd? Personally, I miss
seeing Mark Smith, 'Ghia Connection Scott, The BusFarmers, Mark L. and Rick
Crandall.
God willing, War-postponing and income pending I might make it to the
Redbarn/Kelly shows this Spring. At least it's a thought.

BottomLine:
If Karl, Harry and Rex can make it from Central/Norcal then I say Thom can make
it.

Come on bee-otch! put that yellow bus on the road!
I promise to provide you with an Odoul's Amber...
