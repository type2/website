Subject: RE: [VB] Weekend salvage yard experience

Agree, Vee Dub has no conscious at times.  Sure it's a business but Glen in
used parts told me last month,(when a nice little '66 Kombi came in) that
'we can make 10 times more money parting it out than selling it whole.'  So
this past weekend, the little Bus was out there, no motor, one door missing,
other doors open, front seats thrown on the ground around it, full of rain
water, starting down the path to becoming molten metal again.  I wish I had
a place with a big old pole barn and I could just stuff it full of Buses...

sadly, austin veedub has been known to crush a few jewels now and 
again! when i bought my s/c from them, it got lucky - a few months 
later they crushed ALL BUSSES except deluxes.
i go out there now and again and see what has come in recently and 
try and save stuff, but one can only do so much :P
last time they had just gotten a new american camper highroof with a 
PRISTINE gray interior... sink, bed, closets etc.

they left all the doors open on it.  water had already begun to ruin 
the laminated woodwork.
