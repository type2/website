Yes you need to exhaust the heater combustion output to the outside.It is a heat exchanger just like the stock VW system excepet it burns gasoline for the express purpose of heating a heat exchanger to heat a vehicle interior(think fuel fired home furnace).

what do you mean you need to run the exhaust out also? DO you mean you need
to exhaust the heater out of the bus? Do you put the heater in the engine
compartment, or inside the bus, and how would you exhaust from either
location?
