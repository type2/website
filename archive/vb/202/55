The South Winds are a bit larger than the Eberspachers because of the extra

the rear seat, in the treasure chest or in the engine compartment.  The
extra blowers are the reason a South Wind puts out more CFM of hot air, it
has dedicated blowers for combustion and hot air, not just one blower that
has to do both jobs.

I'm working on a couple jump seat models right now and I think I will build
a metal box with sound proofing in it for noise and to make the skeptics
feel a little safer.  Not to mention, the metal box will protect the heater
from all sorts of things that get thrown under the seat, kind of like the
bug heaters that had a fiberglass shell that kept things from hitting it
under the hood.
