Subject: re:heaters

Thanks to everyone for all the responses, the stewart warner or southwind
heaters sound great, but for now i think i will go with a procat heater. I
can always find another use for it if I install one of the other heaters,
but I don't think I am up for installing one of those heaters this winter-no
time, and space is difficult to get this time of year. I usually work on
mine in my driveway, but not at these temps.

I ordered a procat from t*rget, $85 delivered.

thanks again.
