If you could reduce the weight somehow, you'd at least
have a fun commuter.

There was a 912 EV for sale a ocuple weeks ago - that would
be an easy one - there are lots of fiberglass, carbon fiber 
and aluminum bits produced for race cars that could be easily
adapted to lighten it.  -30lbs for the engine lids, another -2lbs
for the fenders.  Mild racing seats would score you about -15lbs.
You can even take the aluminum front end bits and rear trailing 
arms for an easy -40lbs or so.  Some guys have gotten 911s down
into the 1800-1900 range *with* full roll cages.

A pickup is a good EV candidate.  Find/fab fibgerglas engine lid
and treasure chest doors, I bet you could take hole saws to the
under-bed supports and frame and save 50lbs if not more.  Build
a front beam out of aluminum.  Fiberglass repro bumpers, courtesy
of Ronnie.  I'm sure a motivated individual could find more.
