Subject: Re: [VB] Anybody have a good heater?

The motor I have right now is on it's last leg(not sure how much longer
it'll live, but I wouldn't feel comfortable taking it on a long trip), so
I'm having to have a new motor built.  Once the new motor is built, it will
become a backup motor.

The transmission was just rebuilt as a freeway flyer(stock gears, 3:88 r/p),
but I didn't think to ask about giving the transmission more strength.  How
much power can a stock transmission handle without showing me the inside of
it?

My current motor already has a header on it, so I'm used to it being louder
than normal.  That's not as much of a concern anymore though.  I just put in
a stereo in my bus.  2 6.5's up front, 2 6x9's and 2 12's in back with a 760
watt amp hooked to the 12's.  I'm not worried about it being too loud.

I'm ready for the cost.  If somebody will just step up and buy my Panel,
then I'll have enough money for the motor.  Time is one thing that I'll have
to work on though.

I might still down the size of the motor still, just have to think about it
some more.  I'm thinking that the smallest I'd want to go with is a somewhat
high performance 1776.  I'll figure it all out when the Panel gets sold.
Anybody need a '58 Panel Bus?
