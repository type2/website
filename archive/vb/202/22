Subject: Re: [VB] Anybody have a good heater?

A stock bus trans was designed to take 150 hp. The drawback to a bus trans is wheel hop and that will slpit a trans in 2 real fast
and that I know from experiance and the $800 I spent on a trans. http://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/index.mv?photo+55183.jpg
And that was with a stock 1600sp. If you want bigger you need to step up to a type 4 motor and pony up the bucks. with the type 4
you get the power plus a long life motor. Sure the $600 for just the shouding to convert it to an upright (from the place in Oregon)
seems a bit much but it is so far the best shroud kit on the market. The cost of building a type 4 is considerably more but in the
long run it will pay for it self when you figure you will build 2-4 type 1's to put out the power and life of a type 4. This is due
in part to the type 1 motor beating itself to death to give you the hp & torque. My motor is running on borrow time right now due to
a rod knock but I am on my way to BBB VII Friday morning. Will I make it all the way there and back? I don't know but what the heck
I am going to give it a shot. But when I get back a type 4 will be in the works for my Kombi along with a '66 big nut trans w/ hd
side covers. So anybody going to BBB VII from So Cali via the flat land route see a grey Kombi on the side of the road it will be me
and my son just kickin it.......LOL.
