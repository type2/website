I have to stick up for the BN4 but in the same breath
i must admit that I have never been in a VW that had a
working Southwind. I just don't like the idea of the
dash mounted model. Not only do they take up a fair
amount of room, require a long gas line, but having a
gas heater inside the bus no more than 2 feet from you
seems a little scary!
