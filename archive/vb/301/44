Subject: Headlight Relay for 1967

Hey guys,

Is there a commonly available relay for the headlights on a '67 bus?  My 
hi-beams are stuck on and no amount of connection cleaning or banging a 
wrench against the relay will free it up.  Every time I toggle my turn 
signal switch I can hear the box click, but nothing happens.
