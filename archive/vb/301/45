Subject: Re: [VB] Headlight Relay for 1967

You could convert  to the floor mounted style pretty easily. Wouldn't look
"correct" though, but the switches are readily avaliable. If you want to
keep the switch at the signal lever, maybe you can use a bug relay box, but
keep the stock box in place, and use the bug box just for the signal relay.
This might be the easier way to go. I've never done it, but it seems like it
could be done. Just make sure you find a wiring diagram for the same year
box that you get so you can run the wires.
