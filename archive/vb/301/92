Subject: Speaking of tranny horror stories...

Anyone remember a fellow by the name of Todd Hill from a couple of years
back or so. He charged me a few hundred bucks to spray paint my old tranny
and sent it back. It lasted about 50 miles. This fellow I speak of robbed
several folks on tranny rebuild deals and some never got there trannys back
from him at all and he moved off to Ohio or something! What ever happened to
him anyway? Be careful out there. I finally had Volkswerks Transaxle in CA
build a freeway flyer for me. Pricey but no more tranny troubles.
