From Me To All of You---
I hope that all of you out there in Bus and Vanagonland are having an
excellent holiday season in whichever way you may celebrate it--
And the most important thing of all, is to have have a happy, healthy,
and prosperous new year--

Thanks to one and all who have provided me with their infinite
wisdom--and jovial messages--

I appreciate it--

Santa was very good to me, and I hope he was also good to each and every
one of Ya'll-----:>)

Take Care--
