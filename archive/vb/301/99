Subject: Re: [VB] Pre 40hp motor gas filter.  Original???

Original VW fuel filter setup on a 40 horse (and others) includes two things:

- The tank screen; and
- The screen in the top half of the fuel pump.


Anything else would not have have come from VW originally.  But it sounds like this German fuel filter is pretty cool and very serviceable!
