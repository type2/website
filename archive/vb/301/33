Subject: RE [VB] backing plate adhesive? 

Hi Michael,
You can try 3M body sealant, or that RV window tape sealant.  Silicon sealant 
will work in a pinch but after a short while will allow water in and rust 
inside there.

PS Can someone pass this on to Michael directly?  We have not been able to 
get posts from the list directly for a few days now and thusly can only view the 
messages through the type2.com website.  Because of this we can not get the 
server address to return directly to Michael.   EEE&B
