Subject: Re: [T2] a little love from my tranny...

Well now, isn't this a fine mess?  
I dropped the engine, pulled the clutch housing and what do ya know,
there's the pinion gear resting on the bottom of the tranny.
Why does this crap happen to me at this time of year?  I already catch
hell from the wife about too many vehicles and now both my rigs are down
with broke transmissions.
I'll have to see if how much Brax will charge for a used unit and then
figure out how to get it home from Butte in a blizzard.
Ok, not really a blizzard but at least a foot of really light fluffy
blowing around snow tonight.
