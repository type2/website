Subject: Brake line bending - curve not "tight" enough

Hi,

I am trying to bend the brake line that goes between the two front 
brake cylinders. Both benders I have used so far don't make a tight 
enough bend or curvature - and the brake line ends up hitting the brake 
shoe.

One of the benders is an off-brand, then I bought a nice KD Tools 
bender.

What brand tool should I use that can make a tight bend but not kink or 
fatigue the line? Is there such thing as a "mini" bender?

Conrad
