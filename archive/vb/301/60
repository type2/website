Subject: Re: My '57 update - new ignition, and added an extra earth

Managed to get all the ignition parts for this early system (points, condensor, rotor and cap) and managed to get them all on between the rain! The bus runs sweet now - better than ever.

I also added an new, extra earth strap from the starter bolt to the tank strap bolt.

Just wondered what the greater wisdom thought about using a bolt that attaches the tank ??
