At least you got your transmission back!  Some didn't.

I am currently running a Todd Hill "rebuilt" in my '71.  It has actually
lasted several years.  When I sent it to him it was popping out of 4th.
It no longer popped out of fourth, but it started dropping out of second
on deceleration.  I suppose that this is an improvment, but not worth the
$600 I paid.

Live and learn...
