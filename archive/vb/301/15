Subject: Re: [VB] needed, cheap heat exchangers for 73 super!!

Man, 

At the last Pomona sway someone left an entire pile of nice rust free
heater boxes sitting in their spot waiting for the trash pick up.  I
grabbed all the tin I could but my wagon was full and no room for the
boxes :-(  No help, sorry.
