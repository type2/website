It's not a FLAPS part, but you can use the one from a '68-up Bug.  Around
$25 new from WCM or RMMW; possibly cheaper from other vendors.

http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/043421.html has trouble-shooting
info.  You might also verify that all the wires are on their correct
terminals, per the wiring diagrams available at
http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring .

If all the wires are connected as per the diagram, swap the white and
yellow wires on the relay.  This will make your low beams stuck on; you
won't be able to use the high beams but at least you can drive without
blinding people.
