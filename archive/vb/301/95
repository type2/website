Subject: Pre 40hp motor gas filter.  Original???

Being a 40hp man, i am not sure if this is original or
not.  Got a motor that has a real cool fuel filter on
it that the PO says in orignal.  Is it?  Don't have a
picture yet but anyone recognize this description?

About 2" tall.  Metal top with clear whitish plasic
base that unscrews from a brass colar.  It is about 1"
in diameter.  It says on top "Made in W Germany" &
"Deutsche" & "Vergaser-Gesellschaft".
It has a swivel gas intake on one side and a fixed gas
exit on the other.

Any ideas?

thanks
Matt
