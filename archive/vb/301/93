Subject: Re: [VB] Brake line bending - curve not "tight" enough

 Conrad, heating and air supply stores sell small benders for refrigeration 
lines, I think they are made by Imperial Eastman. They are painted black and 
made of aluminum and fit around four different sizes, the line fits in a bender 
shoe and the handle rolls the bend into the line really nice for fancy tight 
bends. Doug Lewis
