Subject: Pitts. Pa Bus needs look-see

Would anyone be willing and able to inspect a Bus for me?
preferably in the next couple of days.....maybe with a digital camera?

It is located in the Pittsburg PA. area near I-76 and I-60 [might be u.s.-60]

You don't need to be an expert,, I would like to know if the vendor is
accurate enough for me to drive the 6hrs to see it in person.

Please contact me.
Thanks!
