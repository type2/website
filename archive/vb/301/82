Yep.  I've done (literally) a thousand of these adjustments - you want the 
TO bearing to be just off of the pressure plate.  An inch or so at the 
pedal is all you need, that keeps about a 1/8" gap between the bearing and 
the plate.  No pressure = no premature wear of the bearing.

As some other volks mentioned, don't forget to inspect the bowden tube, and 
remember, grease is your friend.
