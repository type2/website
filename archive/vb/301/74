Subject: Re: [VB] clutch cable breaks

hm.. I've always done it 1/2-3/4 " play from the TO bearing hitting the clutch... not loose at the cable.  (figuring the idea is that you just want some space before the clutching comes into effect) like you said you used to...and have rarely broken a clutch cable... maybe once in a bus.   I did a couple time in my bug, and after the 2nd time I greased the cable (oops, didn't the first two) and it has lasted for years since then.
