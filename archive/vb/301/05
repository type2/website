Ah Dear Chuck,
First of all, FLORIDA? no wonder and you call me misguided =)
Speaking of misguided, I hear that the Air Force tends to "Aim High" Is that
for windage or just leading the target? I know some lefties who seem to have
the same motto. Way to go! (don't ask dont tell~ just amp up on the goldenseal
occassionally).
Politically, I have been diagnosed as being a political centrist, based in
reality with a touch to the right and up a tad toward the Libritarian side. I
am conservative in "conserving" BILLIONS of tax dollars, the OG US Constitution
the intended checks and BALANCES between all three branches of the National
Gubbermint. 
When addicted and a hypocritical, lying bigot demigod, Rush Limpburger used to
say that the only thing in the middle of the road, besides a barndoor VW bus in
a high cross wind, is a yellow stripe. Whelp, I muse that it's flakey on the
extreme edges~ both of them. Low "bushes" on one side and a potential Nay-dar
traps on the left.

Oh you guys, dont take me so seriously! I'm just getting warmed up so I will
have something to do after ALL of the jobs have been exported and all them thar
ferriner have been allowed to import. I support your President in as much as
his energy policies will eventually trickle down to us all... that is as long
as there is a need for self-service gas station attendants who don't speak
Espanol. Someone pass the oxycontin...
Sheesh, In the meantime, I'm gunna go adjust the valve gap on the Peugeot and
have me an expresso at the cafe' while watching a Johnny Depp movie.
Happy Kwanzaa, y'all ;-p
