Subject: Re: [T2] PEI RUN

Maybe the subject should be Bus'n to the Canadian Maritimes in summer 2004

There was a bit of interest shown a while back, heading to PEI.

I'll be planning my Vacation in the Westfalia around JULY 29 to AUG 2  for
the arrival of the Tall Ships.

If you plan on watching "Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black
Pearl"... you might see some familiar sights.
