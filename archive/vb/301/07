OMG! Long time allies??? WTF?

You people are dillusional. France didn't want to help us nuke saddam
because they were in bed with him financially. Same thing for Germany and
Russia. It's all about the money people. We would have done the same thing
as they did if they wanted to kick Tony Blair out of the UK.

You global,  feel good, kissy-kissy guys need to get a grip on reality.

  I with Ellis, can't wait for a change for the good, tired of people
putting down our longtime allies, and cheering on the insanity, sure
Saddam was bad, and if we were not in such a hurry to put down our allies
they would have been helping us now, go to truthout.org to read what is
really going on, or Paul Krugmans column in the NYT.
