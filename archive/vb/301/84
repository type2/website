Subject: a little love from my tranny...

HAPPY *!%%#! HOLIDAYS!!!
I went to back my bus in the garage last night (low of 18 last night,
it's 14 right now) and I got stuck at the curb, no biggie, a little
rocking and I'll get through...then...
No bang, no crunch, no whining recently, nothing...
Shifter feels normal, that ruled out the clutch...
I get a flash light and check the CVs and shafts, they look intact...
So I use my little 87 Ranger 4x4 to push her into the driveway(3rd & 4th
are missing in this one btw).
I'm thinking the shift linkage came off at the nose of the tranny...
This morning I pushed her into the garage, got her up on the stands and
had a look...
Shift linkage is intact, I spin the tires, they move hubs at the tranny
but don't spin the opposite tire when the linkage is in gear,
I need help!!!
Did the tranny implode without prior notice or symptoms?
Are there shift rails and forks in the nose that could have broken and
prevent anything else inside from hooking up?
Thanks for any and all help,
