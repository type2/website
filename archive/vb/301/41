In the reprint Bentleys, there is a list of "Adhesives and sealing
compounds".  To me, "Genuine VW Adhesive D 12" is the best candidate.
Throughout the "Body" section, D 12 is called out for sticking seals
to panels and doors.

http://wetwesties1.tripod.com/Journeys2/z4-2.html specifically mentions
using D 12 on felt.  The beginning of a RAMVA thread on D 12 alternatives
is at
http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=371C04D4.53D6%40sprintmail.com .

Next question... what the hell is D 12?  It thins with benzene, if
that's any help.  Maybe call the VW dealer and ask for some?

We already know you're not using NOS Hanover air in the tires, so we
can probably forgive a little inaccuracy with the gas tank felts... :)
