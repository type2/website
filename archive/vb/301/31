Subject: backing plate adhesive?

I am in the midst of trying to put the stock front drums brakes back together on my 65 bus. I took the brakes apart right back to the backing plates. Now that I am in the process of putting them back together I read in the VW manaul that the backing plates should have adhesive on the to seal them to the knuckles/kingpins (whatever is back there can't recall the order).

Anyway.. what should I use for adhesive, the manaul mentions some VW part that I am sure has been out of production for longer than I have been on the planet.

Any help appreciated- please p-mail as I am not reading the list actively.

Thanks

michael
