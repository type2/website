The end of the sending unit is calibrated to about 70 degrees. Now when that
temperature changes, it doesn't necessarily throw the whole temp reading out
of whack, it just changes it slightly. You can see by how much if you put
the end of the sender in the oven set to 350 degrees, and with the plug end
out of the oven, hold ice to it and check the temperature difference. As
long as all your engine seals are in place, to keep the plug end of the
sender from getting real hot, the readings should be fairly accurate.
