Subject: [VB] shifting in to 3rd & 4th very hard

Hi list -
I tried to embark on a road trip on sat when I found myself unable to shift into 3rd & 4th easily.  After replacing the front shift bushing a month or two ago, the bus has been shifting like a dream.  I couldn't see anything wrong with the front shift bushing.  The only thing I did prior to this problem was put on a new rear bumper.  The bumper required alot of work to get on because of my empi single quiet pack hanging out ( i will go to stock exhaust one of these days.. ) and the bumper is putting a lot of upwards and forwards torque on the engine due to the fact that it is pushing on the exhaust.  Is it likely that this is pushing the tranny just enough to bind the hock stick connector on the rear shift rod?
If not, what is a one person ( out on the road ) procedure for troubleshooting stuff like this?

weather has been nice, want to drive!

thanks

rob
