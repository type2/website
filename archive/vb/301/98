Subject: 61 DC progress , Steering locks & simple Bug question

Finally got a little time to work on the VW's this
last week.

Big accomplishment was getting the 61 DC's steering
Pivot Bushing installed.  (thanks Ronnie for the
correct parts)  Good to be able to push the bus around
again. The bushing has been out for a few months while
i tried to get the parts.  Also started to take apart
the shifting linkage to rebuild it.  It is going to
take some time though to get it apart.  Going to have
to do the Heat & WD-40 routine for a while.

Steering Locks.....

I am sure this has been asked before but i did not
find anything in the archives.  Anyone know a
replacment tumbler that can be used to rebuild a
steering lock?  Rumer a few years back was that a late
bus ignition would work.  Anything?  don't care what
the key looks like, just want to rebuld a core i have
and not have to spend Bookoo bucks for a NOS unit.  I
have the steering box converted and ready to accept
the lock but.....

64 BUG....

Not a bus, but maybe someone knows.  Got my 64 bug
back on the road as well.  (Been about 3 years) 
Mainly needed a new battery and a little TLC.  Tried
to reset the rear suspension because i think it sags. 
(It Looks like it is on a Negative rake)   No luck. 
Anyone know the proper riding height for a bug?  Can
not seam to find that anywhere.  (Distance from the
ground to the pan?)

thanks
Matt
