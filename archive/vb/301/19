Everybody needs to read them, specifially the last sentence of this part
of the charter:

FRIDAY. TGIF is an institution that started on v(-at-)l, our motherlist. It's a
release, it's a morale-builder, it's when the content restrictions get
loose. Understand that Friday ends at midnight on that day, it does not
endure indefinitely. And, even on Friday, messages must have bus content.
