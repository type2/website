NO RESERVATIONS needed. The London Bridge Bullis have secured the same
location as last year, all camping and fees are paid to LBB. We have our own
entrance and have nothing to do with the state parks except paying them a
fee for the area. Gates open Friday sometime, I do not know the wxact time,
but I am sure someone will be there in the early AM

I have been visiting the Arizona State parks site and it appears that you 
need reservations at some places.
If we appear at the site at Friday noon do we need to make reservations?
