Hi John,
You are going to have to find a threaded insert to do the job.   Time-Serts 
are a very thin wall item and with the self tapping studs pulling out  the hole 
is now probably now too big for Time-Serts.  Counting the  stock inserts and 
Time-serts as about the same outer diameter there are two more  bigger sizes 
of inserts that we have been able to get from local fastener stores  and VW 
FLAPS.  You will need stock non-self tapping studs to use with solid  inserts.
 
  Even with the proper OD threaded inserts tapped into each hole, the  
problem probably is not going to go away.  Since there are already self  tapping 
studs replacing the stock studs this problem that has happened  before.  The real 
cause with aluminum/magnesium AKA electron alloy is  that when OVERHEATED it 
softens and the studs pull out.  We suggest  installing oil temp and oil 
pressure gauges to see what is going on back there  and take step as needed to run 
the engine cooler!!
