Subject: Re: [VB] re:Which Heater

I wish I had more time to rebuild heaters, but they aren't rocket
science.  I've always said, if you can rebuild a carburetor, you can
rebuild a gas heater.  I started selling parts a number of years ago
because I was having problems finding them for my own heaters.

I prefer the Stewart Warner VW SouthWind heaters because in my
opinion they are easier to work on and put out a lot of BTU along
with larger CFM's.  Of course you'll hear supporters of other brands,
this is just my opinion.

If you can pick up a fairly complete heater, I carry NOS factory
rebuild and parts manuals along with all the parts you will need to
get a SW heater back in service.  When you get your heater working,
you will love the large quantity of heat these things put out.
