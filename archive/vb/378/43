Thanks Tristan,

I did some searching locally for SPDT relays and everything I found
was $20 or more ea. So I looked online and found a kit for $5, I
ordered a few. I found them at autotoys.com in case anyone else needs
a source.

I was also wondering if it would be worth the effort to put a toggle
switch on the pump somehow so I could run it for a few seconds to fill
the bowl, say after I disconnect the line for some reason or need to
rebuild the carb etc. Any thoughts on that?

Thanks,

matthew
