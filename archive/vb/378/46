Yikes!!  Bosch 0-332-209-150 is a pretty common part number for
installing alarms and other accessories. $2-$3 seems to be the going
rate online for just the relay, a bit more if it includes the socket.

You could also just pull the wire from relay terminal 85 off of the
oil pressure sender and turn the ignition on for a few seconds to run
the pump- once the fuel system is primed, turn ignition off and
re-connect the wire to the sender before starting it.

Good Luck!
