I had the same problem last time I changed an accelerator cable. The 
original cable was made of wire, whereas the replacement was many braided 
strands and far more flexible. It kept sticking at the bend just before the 
rearmost crossmember.

My solution was to use a piece of wire as a guide, which was sufficiently 
stiff for me to push it through the bend. Once the guide wire was through, I 
tied the new cable to it and pulled it through. Now I keep the guide wire 
with the spare cable in my tool kit.
