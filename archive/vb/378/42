It looks like you have the wrong elbow that attaches to the carb on your 
setup. That looks like the elbow for the right side aircleaner. I was using 
one of those until I found the correct elbow for the left setup. 

The difference is in how the elbow curves. If you hold the elbow upward so 
the carb end is up and the throat opening is way from you, the bend will go 
to the right for the left-side aircleaner and to the left for the right-
side cleaner.  The left-side elbow moves the tube back against the fan 
shroud so the tube has a straight shot back to the cleaner and not angled 
as yours is.

I guess that eric&Barb are correct and I am wrong.
 I just was confused with my 70 1600 SP engine in the 1970 westy.
the singlecab air filter is on the left! the 70 filter is on the right.
