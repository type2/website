That's Ark Mirvis in NJ. Start saving up a heater from him is around $500.

the Stewart Warner or Eberspacher are the type to use. I got a Stewart
Warner-supposed to crank out 20,000 BTU. That Webasto one you showed looks
too small to heat a bus. There seem to be a lot of heaters for sale out
there, generally they are missing parts.



If you want check this guy's site out..
http://pages.prodigy.net/busbarn/southwind.html Rick Taylor, I guess really
busy, but he sells spare parts for southwind/stewart warner (I think the
same thing).



There was a guy, I think in New Jersey, who was rebuilding heaters-you could
get a refurbished unit from him. Then you don't need to spend forever trying
to find all the right parts. He was advertising on thesamba.com
