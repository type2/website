Subject: Oil bath?

I just bought an oil bath filter from Clara on the Samba and am having to piece it together, you know filter, elbow, rubber or metal tube. Which brings me to my question, What connecting tube (carb to filter) would a 63 Panel have had? I've seen the metal ones and the rubber ones. Thanks for the info.
