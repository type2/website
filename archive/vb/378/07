Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] bending brake lines

 I ordered the full brake line kit from type2parts.com(don't think it's the 
same as the bus depot kit) for my deluxe and was happy with the quality. 
Much better IMHO than the 2 piece long lines some other places are selling. 
I unbent mine from the shipped shape(bent in two places to fit a long box) 
and bent it to fit the bus by hand using no tools, other than a pair of 
pliers(for leverage) to hold the fitting(don't hold the line with pliers!) 
when I had to do a bend on a short piece torward the end. Go slow and take 
your time, using the original as a template. I didn't think it was nearly as 
bad to bend it as I thought it would be, and others had told me it would be. 
Installing it the bus was worse than I expected.
