It is really hard to tell if you can get away with just rings w/o inspecting the cylinders.  The engine in my 61 got rebuildt heads, new rings (just regular ones) and rod bearings.  This was years and tens of thousands of miles ago and runs fine.    It's a 1600 sp.  Total cost:  less than $200.   
 
But is the bottom end of you engine good?   Try the push pull on the crank pulley with the engine at TDC.   The forward back motion should be within a few thousandths of 0.006".   Some play can be shimmed out, excessive play means wrorn main bearings and a total rebuild is due.
You would also want to check the compression.
