There is a little info gleaned from manuals and books at
http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/078406.html .  Going by those
numbers, that transmission case was built sometime between November 1963
(early '64 model year) and July 1965 (end of '65 model year).  If you
assume that Bus production was fairly constant over that time frame, you
can interpolate your serial number to about November 1964.
