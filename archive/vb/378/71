Subject: re:muffler question

Now I will reveal some lacking in my education.  I have a 67 bus (requiring
the tailpipe that goes through the cutout in the engine tin on one side),
with a 1600 engine (not the original) with a fresh air heater system.  What
do I choose as stock?  I have been reading about how the 40 horse muffler is
narrower by an inch or so, I can't use a bug muffler (two tailpipes), or I
assume a later model bus because the rear tin is different (tail pipe goes
out the side ?)...

So given my situation, what is a stock bus muffler in my case?

Thanks for the response.
