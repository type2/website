This could mean:

- The black wire from the ignition switch terminal 15 to the arrow light
   in the speedo is broken.
- The arrow light in the speedo has a burnt-out bulb or a bad socket.
- The blue wire from the arrow light in the speedo to the flasher is
   broken.

None of these things are particularly critical, but they will at least
stop the arrow light from working, even if everything else is all right.

Did you get anything at all to light up, or nothing?

Did you ever try a new lamp back there?  Last I heard you put some
aluminum foil around the lamp base to make it fit better.

Random thought... does this Bus show any signs of ever being set up to
tow a trailer?  If so, are there mysterious wires running from where a
trailer hitch would be to the tail lights?  I don't think there are, but
if they are there, you might get rid of them and see if that helps.

> The part# for the hazard relay is 211 953 101A it is a 12V relay.

Has your Bus been converted to 12 V?  Also, what is the part number on
the flasher?  (It may not have a VW-style part number - that's OK.)

This seems OK.  The black/purple and black/green/white wires should join
at the "+" terminal on the flasher relay, if you have an original type
flasher.  That far right fuse is OK, right?

OK.

OK.

Besides this wire, 87b should have another black/green wire coming off of
it that goes to the right front turn signal.

This seems OK, as long as the connection at the flasher is to terminal
"S".  Also I'm not sure which schematic has "S4B1" as a reference on it;
what schematic are you looking at?

> And of course the blue wire goes to the speedo light on top.

This is right.  The blue wire should go to "K" on the flasher.

> Does the fact that this is a 12V hazard relay have any bearing?

As long as the Bus is 12 V, it shouldn't matter.  Even if the Bus is 6 V,
the only thing that will happen is that your front outside lamps may not
flash when you have the hazards on.  But it shouldn't have anything to do
with your turn signals working or not.

> Does the location of the wires on the hazard switch have any bearing?

Your thinking is correct.  When the hazard switch is off, none of the
four wires that go to it are connected to anything.  When it's on, all
four are connected together.  That's why it doesn't matter which goes
where.

That seems pretty bizarre.

If you do this, *and* flip the turn signal switch to "left turn" or
"right turn", do any of the outside lamps light up?

> Thanks for bearing with me.

You're welcome.  If you want, and if you're anywhere within a few hours
by road of Tulsa, Oklahoma, I'm willing to come by and help you work on
it.  (I seem to remember you're in California but that may not be
right.)
