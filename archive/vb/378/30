Subject: Re: [VB] Stripped cylinder head studs

Hey John  This is when you will need to use case savers. These are inserts 
that are threaded on the outside and inside. The inside threads come in two 
sizes 8mm and 10mm depending on your head stud sizes.  The most common cause isn't 
overheating but a weak alloy mix in the blocks. normally will be either an H 
or B case  . These can on cases made in 68 thur 70   In 1973 VW installed 
these case saver at the factory also first year of using the 8 mm head studs.  It 
is usually best to do this when you are rebuilding but it can be done without 
tearing the case all the way apart but it is really hard to get them straight 
and there will be metal shavings getting into the case  later and have fun
