Subject: Re: [T2] bending brake lines

<<what is the best way to unbend and rebend steel brake lines?>>

You should have bought them locally with the right metric ends on them.
I don't know what Ronnie is selling but at most local FLAPs there is
such a thing a flexible brake lines which will take bend and be able to
relax again if needed.

Hope this isn't another one of his Genuine, Made in Taiwan, Germany
parts offerings.

Looks like you may be doomed here.
