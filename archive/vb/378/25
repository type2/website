Subject: Bus BRRR Sweatshirts and event flyer

Hello Volks Folks,

Check out the Bus BRRR event flyer and sweatshirt that was made for the Feb
11th - 12th Angola, IN event. Artwork was created by the talented Mary
Wisnewski. The hooded sweatshirts will be available at the event for $30. If
you do not make it to the event and would like one of these sweat shirts
just send me a message and I will give you instructions for purchasing one
with PayPal. 

 

Please take a minute and print out a few of these flyers and give them to
others that you think might be interested in joining us. 

 

All the money raised from the sale of the sweatshirts will be matched two
times by a charitable giving foundation and then donated to the Phoenix
Society for Burn Survivors. Their mission is to help heal the emotional and
physical scares of those whose life has been dramatically changed by a burn
injury. 

 

On behalf of many burn survivors that have benefited from the support and
love from the bus community, Thank you!
