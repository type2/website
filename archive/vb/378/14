Subject: Transmission Year

Any help appreciated

	I am looking to find out what year this transmission is. The case
number is 113 301 103 and the serial number is 7157604. I am having a
transmission rebuilt and want to know if this is a 12 volt transmission for
a core. The bushing for the starter is worn out by a loose starter at one
time so I am not sure if it is 6 or 12 volt. It also had a nose cone on it
with what appears to be a reverse switch. This came out of a 64 sundial but
nothing on that bus was original.

Thanks,
Eric
