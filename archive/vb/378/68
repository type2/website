Hi All -

Though previous posts show that it's generally best to invest in fresh 
cylinders, I'll offer this 70's tale:

Along with the slightly crumpled factory sliding roof and popouts '67 
sedan, bought for $400 from the budding young tennis starlet-to-be's 
father, after she had tried to jump start it one last time down a hill 
from her driveway and left it parked against a power pole before 
gallivanting off to her next tournament in Europe somewhere, came an 
engine covered in oil, along with the rest of the engine compartment, 
from a severe cooler leak.  We towed it to the shop and discarded the 
motor.

Doug Bean had a used, but judged not to have been severely overheated, 
H case motor from one of his customer's cars that didn't make it 
through a traffic accident.  As budget was paramount,  I bought a 
fresh set of Dykes rings from GB and after a careful and lengthy hand 
honing with a dingleberry of each cylinder, fresh bearings and seals 
all around (trusting that the case was still straight enough), fresh 
valves (but not new guides) in the original but now home ported single 
port heads and a blueprinting job on the solex 28 carb, we reassembled 
and I then drove this motor for 70,000 miles before low compression 
retired it to where it's many still usable pieces await in my shed for 
the next cob rebuild.

Total parts cost?  With a fresh clutch disk, new lightened flywheel, 
1.25 rockers on a hd shaft, 009, plugs and wires, and a Single Quiet: 
about $550.

Nick
