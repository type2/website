Subject: Re: [T2] Feel tank w/water to weld?

The easiest way to weld the tank is to pipe a hose to it off a running
vehicle and fill it with it's exhaust.

No oxygen--no BOOM !!

I've done plenty of tanks--water will not always fill every pocket of
gas fumes and I've had them blow---
Not apart--but enough BANG to make me want to change my shorts, and
distort the  heck outa the original shape of the tank.

The pressure washer at work has a steel tank in it---it developed a leak
on the bottom of it---

What the heck---fuel oil won't blow--

I washed it out good with muriatic, and
started mig welding a patch ----

KA-BANG!!

The 2'x 2"x2 tank got airborne off the  Drott deck crane where I was
welding it, and it scared the hell outa me---
another trip to Wal Mart for more Jockey shorts--- ~ : )

Ya gotta starve the tank of any oxygen, and filling it with exhaust
works good.

Just plug all the inlets and outlets with a cork, rag , whatever--and
work fast.
