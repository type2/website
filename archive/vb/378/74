Subject: Re: Blinker woes again

I finally got both the blinkers and four way flashers to work with the stock wiring set up just as it is on the diagram for a 63 US bus on the VB website. All this time it seems that ALL of the Five different three prong flashers I've been using have been bad. Out of desperation I went and got a new flasher and low and behold everything came to life. The flasher relay has a tricky ground too. The only thing left is to figure out why my 1157 bulb on the right rear taillight will not light both filaments. Again thanks for the assistance.
