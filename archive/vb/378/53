Subject: Piston Rings

I've been getting alot of blow by lately on #s 3 and 4 which is soaking my plugs. I want to put in some new rings and wanted to go with the Total Seal brand gapless rings. I searched high and low for these rings for the 1500 SP and couldn't find them. I finally contacted the company and they said to get some I would need bore size, ring groove height and ring groove depth. The workshop manual I have has compression ring gap and oil control gap specs and side clearance specs but no ring groove depth. Any body out there have that info handy? Also has anybody had any experience with these rings?
