Subject: Motor time. 

Anyone have recomendations for engine builders in CA preferably, or western US. I did a compression test and i'm due. REAl due. LOL
  I think I'm wanting a 1776 SP, CW crank, redone heads, new case (VW), balanced and built to last. This last motor lasted me 7 years so a ball park price would be good as well. Oh, NO GEX. 
   
  You can reply to this on the list or in an email. Thanks
