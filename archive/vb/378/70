Subject: re:I just got a new camper

I've got one of those ez campers.it is great. And I do use it as a daily
driver and then some. Over the years I've had it.I've hauled tons of
concrete, wood.tons of wood, furniture, driven across country 6 times(well
boston to Houston).

 

The thing is great. I've been rebuilding the interior cabinets-based on the
original ones that came with the bus. Please let me know what you do with
your stuff-especially the windows. One of my windows is in rough shape. I'd
like to replace it.

 

If you have any pics of the interior-that would be great. Mine is not a walk
thru-and it was in pretty good shape when I got it, I just like to see other
pics of these. Does your have a special light over the table that hinges on
the driver side? Actually does a walkthrough have that table?

 

Thanks and enjoy!
