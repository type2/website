Subject: I just got a new camper

I just got a 65 EZ camper :o)
 Its been sitting for 13 years after someone sugared the tank. Its a  
walk-thru and the body is in good shape even the battery tray is solid as  is the 
interior. I think with my engine swap and a few hours I should be up  and 
running. I cant wait to show it off at the camp outs. I do plan on making  this a 
daily driver also , how can you not drive your bus all the time? I  think I will 
sell the EZ camper interior  and  camper windows and use  the westfalia camper 
interior  out of my 67 in it. This was a great  find and I figured after 13 
years off the road it needed saving:o)
