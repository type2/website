-- -- Actually, Bay slats are longer than split.

   Just to clarify on pricing, I've set a single price for SC/DC and bay/split.
$170.00 any set, plus shipping. Custom woods extra(other than oak, beech, or
maple, based on species). Shipping anywhere in the U.S.is between $35-$45 and I
pay the extra for insurance. We shipped out 3 sets last week and all arrived in
4-5 days. The feedback we've recieved so far has been excellent. Hope this
helps,

Chris
