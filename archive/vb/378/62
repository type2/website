Yes.  You need a relay.  From a post I made a few months ago:

---
You have to have an SPDT relay - in other words, the 87 and 87a contacts
aren't just tied together, but alternate.  With the relay coil off, 30
and 87a are connected.  With the relay coil on, 30 and 87 are connected.
You'd hook 30 to hot-in-run and 87a to the pump, and the coil between
the ignition and the oil pressure switch.
---

Reading that again, it may not be totally clear what to do with the
coil.  86 should go to hot-in-run (black wire at ignition coil).  85
should go to the oil pressure switch, along with the wire that goes to
the idiot light.  Now back to our story:

---
OK.  With the key off, the relay coil is off (no power), and 30 and 87a
are connected.  The pump doesn't run, though, because there's no power
coming in to 30.  When you turn the key on, the oil pressure switch is
closed, so the relay coil is on and 30 and 87 are connected.  Since
nothing is connected to 87, nothing happens.  When you start the engine
(using the fuel in the float bowl), the oil pressure light goes out, so
the relay coil is off, so 30 and 87a are connected and the fuel pump
runs.  If the oil light comes on while the engine is running, the relay
coil is on and 30 and 87 are connected.  This removes power from 87a,
shutting down the pump.
---

If you rigged this up and wanted a way to run the fuel pump when the
engine didn't have oil pressure, the simplest thing would be to turn on
the key and pull the wire off of the oil pressure switch.  This would
make the pump run as long as the oil pressure switch wire wasn't
grounded.
