Are you putting the hatch over the tank (for sender access) or over the
engine?  There is a neat article about installing a sender access hole
here http://www.specialpatrolgroup.co.uk/spooky/access/access.html and I
don't see why you couldn't scale this up to a full hatch if you wanted
it.  You will have to cut the floor of the Bus with the tank in place,
but all of the welding can be done well away from the Bus.

If I were doing this I might install some thin, flat foam weatherstrip
on the removable panel, just to seal off the engine compartment a bit
more.  Also, for a larger panel, it might be good to weld a couple of
reinforcement bars on the back of the panel - maybe a couple of lengths
of 1/2" or 3/4" square tubing.
