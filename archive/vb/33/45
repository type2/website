You on  the right track with the long board.  I've been lucky enough to work 
with some real old school bodymen (30+ years in the biz) and picked up a few 
little tricks here and there.  The long board and a straight edge are you 
best friends.  Also, when it comes to sanding to much, try a little guide 
coat.  This is basically a fog of rattle can paint, you pretty much just 
leave little dots all over your mud.  Start sanding and the board removes the 
guide coat.  Ta da!!! you can now see your low spots, so when you re-mud you 
have a better idea of to mud and where to skim.  I've gotten to where the 
corners are close to done, I'll drop the long board and grab a tube.  These 
tubes are what masking paper comes on, you may be able to dumpster dive one 
at your local body shop, or they just may give you one if you ask.  It just 
needs to be about 14 inches long.  You can now put a stick it piece of 80 
grit on it.  With this you can pull the paper around the corner.  Start high 
and pull down while you pull around.  With a little work, you'll be amazed at 
the roundness of your corners.
                                                                              
   Happy Sanding,
