John,
     Ahhhh, nothing like the sound of  a 40hp on a cold winter morning while 
all your neighbors are jump starting their Chevys.  I believe that's the 
stock dizzy and the carb will do fine.  You may wanna  check the Rocky 
Mountian Motor Works Cataloge if you have one laying around.  I don't like 
there prices (some of us call them the home of the $36 window crank) but 
there one heck of a page on dizzy's and what they fit in there cataloge.
                                                                              
  Peace,

   To many VW's to list
