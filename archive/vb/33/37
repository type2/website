I'm guessing that this harness uses the original lap belt locations for
two of the "points".  Where do the other two go?

Also, I figured I'd put this quote from Muir somewhere in this thread...

"If your car is properly maintained, with good brakes and steering,
 clean windshield, lights and wipers that work and all that, then
 your safety is a direct function of what you are -- what you are
 being as you whistle down the road.  If we all constantly drive as
 if we were strapped to the front of the car like Aztec sacrifices
 so we'd be the first thing hit, there would be a helluva lot less
 accidents."
