Subject: Re: [VB] Body work

Ed,
I ran into the same problem with the wheelwell lip. I used a pneumatic line 
sander, which kept my hand from "rolling with the curves". It did the trick. 
You have the right idea with the 14" sanding block for the corners (once 
again, to keep from dipping and curving too much). I use a rasp to take down 
most filler, and use the sander/block when I have a good "line" to work 
with. Experience is gonna be your best measure... Maybe you should do it 361 
times (grin). Hope this helped.
