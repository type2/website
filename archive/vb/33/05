Hi Steve,
Just went out and got a long board and some sandpaper to go along with it.  I will update you all on my progress.  Thanks for the input.

This will allow you to see where your low spots are (they will be the areas where there is still paint left).  You should also be using a long board to help you get the area straight (at least 14").  Use a cross hatch sanding pattern.
