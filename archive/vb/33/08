Subject: VW show and go

I went to the VW go and show at Raceway Park, Englishtown NJ on Sunday.  
There were 9 splits that showed up (including my 56 Kombi).  They were:

1) 67 white camper - immaculate
2) 66 dark green camper - immaculate
3) 67 standard - dayglow green and white with matching interior - immaculate
4) 62 dark green single cab - immaculate
5) 64 crew cab - dove blue - immaculate
6) 56 dove blue kombi - very good condition
7) 65? light green/white standard in process of restoration
8) 64 light green/white daily driver in good condition

There was also this thing that showed up.  It was 62-65 era splittie sort of. 
 The top and front were welded onto another chassis.  I couldn't tell for 
sure, but I thought it was a Toyota mini van.  The front looked normal, the 
sides had a sliding door (flat) welded into the curved sides of a bus, and 
the rear was an abortion at best.  The dashboard was from the original van 
chassis with a center console between the seats with an automatic trans.  It 
was obviously someone's experiment.

Sorry, but I don't know what kind of campers that they were.  They didn't 
have the usual Westi top, just a square piece that goes strait up - about 4' 
square.

The show was well attended with all classes of VW's and many great old air 
cooled ones. Many drag racing V's and many vendors etc.  They wouldn't let me 
take my Kombi down the quater mile.  Said I would put the crowd to sleep, and 
that their timing gear stooped timing at one minute.
