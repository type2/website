Subject: What is an early 60s Panel worth?

Have to ask you all this. My friend has an early 60's model Panel. The rear
end has been cut out from the previous owner for a buggy. Other then that
the front nose is bent somewhat, the body seems to be in good shape, but
didn't get under or really investigate in other portions.
   Any Ideas?
