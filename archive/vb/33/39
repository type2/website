Subject: Re: clunking sound from fan

well... may be too late if you already pulled the motor, but this happened 
to me once. and boy it was LOUD! the hole in the center of the fan is round 
with squared off sides. (if that makes any sense, see below) and the hole 
became rounded out and was spinning unevenly, thus rubbing the inside of the 
shroud. the nut can even be tight as hell, but this still *may* be your 
problem. you can get it out without pulling the motor.
