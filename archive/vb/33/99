Subject: SWEPCO 201 tranny oil

I was just wondering if anyone used SWEPCO 201 80W-90 gear oil in their VW
bus transmissions?

It is very popular with the Porsche crowd and works very well in my 911 with
the 915 transmission.

SWEPCO is heavy duty stuff and cost about $35 a gallon.  I know a lot of
people are really picky about getting GL-4, but I figure since SWEPCO 201 is
GL-5 rated it meets or exceeds the older GL-4 specifications.

I have put about 1000 miles on the tranny on a cheapo Castrol 80W-90 gear
oil cleaning cycle.  Not sure what GL grade Castrol is?  Now I need to dump
the Castrol and put in the good stuff.  (not implying Castrol is
non-quality, but just want a heavy duty oil for a standard 30,000 mile
service)
