I would have to consider that a restoration to
original specs but NOT an original specimen. The
"upgrades" weren't done by VW even though the upgrades
might be NOS it isn't (in my opinion) an original car.

For safety reasons, i wouldn't consider a 6 to 12 volt
swap that destuctive to a cars originality. I do
however, agree with your comment on the instalation of
a larger or different size motor. It would fit into
the fact that the engine is not the original that was
equiped with that car.
