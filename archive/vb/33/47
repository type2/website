Subject: Wheel Cylinders

I have a full set of new wheel cylinders for a '63. Rosie doesn't need them
anymore so I thought I would sell them. Could someone please tell me what
years they fit. I believe it's '57-'63, but I have been wrong before. I also
have the brake drums, which are used but in good condition. Does anyone have
the maximum ID spec so I can tell if they are beyond the limit? Before the
go up on e*ay, does anyone want to make me an offer?

Thanks for the help
