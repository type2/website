Here's one data point from the "Old Cars Price Guide": ballpark values
for a 60-64 Type 2
Kombi (their survey doesn't include panels for these years):

1--trailer queen, never driven:  $18000
2--excellent original or superior resto:  $9800
3--good amateur resto, presentable & serviceable:  $5600
4--deteriorated resto, but driveable:  $2800
5--needs complete resto, but not wrecked:  $1700
6--parts car:  $550
