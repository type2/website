I don't have a chart of front axle serial numbers, but the rubber
stop part number (if correct and original) would seem to indicate
you have a pre-'64 front beam.  Take a look at callout no. 4 on
http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part/255.png .  That
111 part is listed for axles up to '63 and for '64 and later it
goes to a 211 part.

The above page is part of the Online Air-Cooled Documentation
Project, http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ .

Can't help with this one.  My only comment is that all air-cooled
Volkswagens have independent rear suspension.  Late models used
CV joint axles (double jointed axles) instead of swing axles,
though.

Good luck!
