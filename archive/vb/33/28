Help! I just ran a new harness in our 65 to rid ourselves of gremlins in our
electrical system. Our wiring diagram only shows one wire coming from the
wiper, but we have three (brown, black, black/purple) Anyone know which
terminal on the switch these go to (54d,54,31b(54 has 2 terminals))? also to
which terminal does power go? Already lost a days work. Many thanks. Chris &
Gina
