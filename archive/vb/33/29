Subject: Re: [VB] clunking sound from fan

I reached around and, although big nut is tight as hell, I got fan to move
side to side slightly by tugging on it.  Then restarted engine and clunking
is now worse.  I guess a shim must have cracked, or I messed something up
when putting the fan back on between the gen shaft and big nut.   I guess
this means another day spent pulling motor,  yada, yada....AAArrrghhhh.  For
all the cool and handy engineering I've found on busses, this generator
replacement has really been a bugger.  Not a complaint though, just another
lesson learned.
