Well, look at OldVolks.com. Ronnie put in a balanced 1776 about 4,000 miles
ago in my 67 and it is the best quality motor I have experienced to date.
Ronnie knows his stuff....

HI!
i am now ready to begin work on my 58, first off i need a new complete
engine. i would prefer something a more powerfull than stock, but whatever
comes my way at teh right time (and at the right price) is what ill get. id
definatly prefer a complete engine, but if it is missing some perifrials (ie
carb, coil, alternator, etc) thats ok too.
thanks!
