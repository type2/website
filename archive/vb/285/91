Both engines probably have carburetors with electric chokes; you may
need to swap out the choke heater elements.  They will have "12 V" or
"6 V" marked on them.  The '71 engine probably has a fuel cut-off
solenoid on the carb; this needs to be changed for the one from the
6 V engine if it has one.  If not, you might swap the whole carb.
