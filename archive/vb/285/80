Subject: Carb prob

Just got back from the last trip of the year in the Westy (more than likely) and I guess I have to pull the carb apart again.
 
Idle was set at 850prm, mixture adjusted, 7.5 BTDC on a 010 and halfway to Mendocino, it wouldn't idle. 
 
I thought I would try to put the jets in it from my old carb as the only problem with it was that the shaft was loose. 
 
Any other ideas?

Ps. Rumour has it that I saw Harry H's sisters camper on 128. Is that true?
