Sounds like some of your wires are hooked up incorrectly.  Get a wiring diagram (see vintagebus.com if you don't have a bentley) and scope it all out under the dash.   particularly at headlight and ig switch.  that they go to and from wher ethey are supposed to.   And there aren't any wierd splices in the 15 circuit (black wire, comes from ig switch w/ ig on)  And check the ground and wires on your gas guage.
