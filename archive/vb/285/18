Subject: Quilted Window Covers for Camping

I've just received my last supply of these before the cold weather sets
in. 

These quilted window covers attach to the insides of your windows using
supplied suction cups when you are camping in the bus, keeping the
interior warm inside by preventing heat loss through the windows (which
is where most of your interior heat escapes). I'd suppose you could keep
some of them up while driving to keep the van warm in cold weather as
well.  Of course, a side benefit is that these give you privacy by
covering your windows just as curtains would. These are complete sets -
a pair for the windshields, three for each side, and one for the rear
hatch window. The exterior is a brushed-aluminum color (silver but not
aluminum-foil-bright silver) with light blue piping. 

Price is $119.95 for the set.
