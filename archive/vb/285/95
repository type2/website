Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Heater cable length

There are 2 lengths for a bus. One is for a walkthru and the other for a
bench.

One side is longer. If you order from WW, they come already bent at the
correct place to compensate for the longer side.

http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part.html , pages 359 and
363, lists four different heater cables, but only one since May 1955.
Pages M-5 6 and M-11 6 of your '63-'67 Bentley also have good
information.  Think about how the heater boxes sit on the engine.  Do
they sit in the position fore and aft position or...?
