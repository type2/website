Subject: 67 tranny question

I picked up a 67 bus with no engine. Yesterday I
grabbed the output drive shaft coming out of the
tranny (where it goes thru the clutch and mates with
the engine). There was no "in & out" play, but there
was noticeable "side to side" play in the shaft when I
wiggled it.
Does this mean that this tranny is no good??
