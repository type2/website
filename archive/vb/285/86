Subject: Re: [VB] Misfire help needed on my '57...

I had a very similar problem with my 61 at one point.  It turned out I had left the reserve switch at the OFF position, which actually let a drip of gas through (I since rebuildt it) so idle and low speeds it was okay, but fuel starved if I drove w/ higher rpms.   just an idea.
