Subject: Re: [VB] 67 tranny question

Some side to side and up and down play in the main shaft is normal. It is
really hard to tell if the transmission is any good without installing it
and driving it.

I picked up a 67 bus with no engine. Yesterday I
grabbed the output drive shaft coming out of the
tranny (where it goes thru the clutch and mates with
the engine). There was no "in & out" play, but there
was noticeable "side to side" play in the shaft when I
wiggled it.
Does this mean that this tranny is no good??
