Ya, coil, generator, and voltage regulator must match generator.   
Also you also gotta sort the FW out.  compare FWs.   The 6V starter has different size teeth than the 12V starter/FW, so you have to swap FW and clutch over.  6V is also slightly smaller FW.
  You oughta check the end play when you swap FWs so you don't set it too tight or loose by using dif shims (between teh crank and FW) or by the FW being slightly dif thickness.   check if the 6V fw is stepped or has a O ring when it meets the crank.   If you have a larger clutch 6V fw it rocks, else use the small clutch

I'm assuming here that the 65 the motor is going to is already all 6V and teh 71 the motor came out of is 12V
