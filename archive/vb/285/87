I also had similar problems, but you said you cleaned out the carb.  If
you do have the carb apart again, I'd check inside the fuel bowl inlet
before the needle valve.  I once had a DP1600 that ran great around
town, but after 5 minutes on the fwy she would die.  Turns out there was
a shard of tank crud/dirt that was severely restricting the flow into
the bowl.  At low RPMs there was enough reserve fuel in the bowl, but
under heavy load the flow would be inadequate ...hence the fwy. fuel
starvation.
