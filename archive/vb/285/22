Bill,

In most cases, literally, you should be able to merely transfer the clutch
assemblies from the old trans to the new one. There are year issues at the
67=68 and 70-74 borders. I'm not an expert in this aspect, but I've been
running this old bus for many years, and have been thru some of the
issues.

The starter bushing is that thingee that the starter shaft shoots into.
Yes, it needs greasing! Also, lightly grease the bearing inside the gland
nut, and very light coat of grease over the trans input shaft, and inner
splines of the clutch disc. Not so much that rotational forces spray it
all over the clutch assembly, but enough to enable proper assembly,
joining, and happy mating of engine and trans.
