Subject: RE: [VB] Which clutch & TO to use??

    It depends if you have a 200 mm clutch or a 180 mm clutch. On the 67
trans (if original) it uses the early t/o bearing, thus a p/p with the ring
on it and a t/o bearing with horseshow style clips. 
    If you need a new p/p make sure that who ever you get it from will take
it back. The new Brazilian Sachs p/p that I have seen are No Good. They
changed the design and they do not center on the flywheel properly. Don't
ask how much this cost me to find out.

I have a 67 bus that has the original 67 transmission
in it.  The replacement engine I have to put into this
bus is an AE code case 1600 DP (all the info I've
found tells me this is a 71 engine)
I know that after 70, the clutch pressure plate and TO
bearing changed, right?? So to mate up a 67 tranny to
a 71 engine, which clutch & TO bearing should I use,
for a 67 or for a 71?? 
My instinct tells me that i should use the later
clutch to match up with the later engine, But I want
to be sure.
