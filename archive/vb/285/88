Can we all say "Fuel Filter" ! These old tanks erupt with rust flakes and
crud. I wouldn't drive without one.

  Turns out there was
a shard of tank crud/dirt that was severely restricting the flow into
the bowl.  At low RPMs there was enough reserve fuel in the bowl, but
under heavy load the flow would be inadequate ...hence the fwy. fuel
starvation.
