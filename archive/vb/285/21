I have been known to copy and record as much info as I can from various
sources as I can too, but only for my personal use. I have found a lot of info
dieing on the web that would be lost forever if not for salvaging it. As for
compiling and selling intellectual and copyrighted property, string em up, and
use and old rope!

A few points, just speaking for myself here...

- The "Online Doc Project"

- If VW were to fire up their landsharks, the doc project would be
  in trouble too.

- On the other hand, I can't believe that VW's landsharks don't know
  about the doc project yet.

- As you mentioned, this isn't the first time this has happened.  A
  few years back a guy was caught auctioning collections of articles
  from the Library at type2.com .  After a few stern e-mails, he
  stopped...  or at least changed email addresses.
