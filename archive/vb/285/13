You can fog your engine with Marvel mysery oil--and no mid winter
starting is necessary---much like any marine equipment--down and fooged
for the winter--works well.
Get your self two items---
A Battery Tender which automaticly moniters the batties level--and keeps
it there---like I use for my motorcycles--works well for 29 bucks.
And one bag of Calcium chloride---fill up several empty cottage cheese,
or butter containers with it---lay them into a Sara Lee cheese cake type
aluminum pan---put thm in the vehicle--in several places.
This will absorb all of the moisture inside the vehicle--more than you
could ever imagine--as most boaters do for the lay up months--works real
good and inexpensive too.

Maybe one dish of moth balls to ward off any vermon would be a good idea
too.
Cover the vehicle up--or store it in the garage--Your done winterizing--
