Subject: need a part for the 66 rear apron

Ok the 2.4 liter is almost finnished, probably by the end of next
weekend she should be ready to breath fire. The single cab though needs
one little part that I hope someone on the list can help me with.
The rear apron was cut by the previous owner in order to install the
type 4 motor in with the stock rear mounted cooling. I have found a
decent replacement apron but it does not have the catch for the latch
installed on it. Does anyone have a parts car they would be willing to
remove it from for me? Or does anyone know if the catch from a bay bus
would work?  
Again thanks as always for your help.
Shawn
