One side of my heater cable broke last winter, so I just wired them
open.  When I got around to it, I bought a replacement from Ronnie at a
show.  Turned out it was the wrong one.  Typical Ronnie sent me a
replacement with out hesitation or the old one, but when that one was
installed it was too short on one side (about 3").  I bought another one
at a local FLVWPS and compared the two which are the same.  

How many different lengths of heater cable are there?  Is one side
longer than the other?  Which one?  I've tried putting each side on the
cable down each tube, but to no avail.  The knob and mechanism is fully
seating in the bore, so I'm sure its in as far as possible.

Am I doing anything wrong?
