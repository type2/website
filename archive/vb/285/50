Ronnie,

Doing heatsink design for electronics, two of the big variables are surface 
area and airflow.
Of course this makes sense.
A 2 x 2 solid block will not dissipate as much heat as a similar 2x2 block 
with vanes cut into the block.

If that same block is then turned crosswise and another set of rows are cut 
into the block, leaving a series of posts, the heat sink improves again.

I learned early on, that it's not the amount of metal, but the surface area 
EXPOSED to the air flow.

Now that's the key part to this whole thing.  Exposed to the airflow.
It sounds to me that they are looking for heads with more surface area, but 
the question becomes, does that increased surface area come at the expense 
of airflow?  Even if it's pressurized from the shroud, if the flash is 
plugging air channels the air will go around and cool elsewhere.

If the increased flash was changing the flow of air over the heads, I would 
not be surprised to see localized hot spots developing.

I'd sure like to know what percentage of improvement in surface area are 
they talking about here?  Not to mention the trade off between increased 
surface area and blocked air passages.

I'll withhold my editorial comments (for now) on using "Flash" as a desired 
performance enhancement.  I don't know if they are just taking "flashy" 
heads and using them or getting heads with a lot of flash and then taking 
the time to laboriously clear out each and every one of the air passages.
