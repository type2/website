Subject: Re: [VB] Which clutch & TO to use??

As far as I know it doesn't matter. You just have to match the TO bearing to the correct pressure plate. The excepetion might be if your tranny has the guide sleeve on it that goes around the imput shaft, then I believe you have to use the later set up. Other than that just match early to early or late to late.
