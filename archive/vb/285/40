Subject: 12 volt to 6 volt engine componenents

I am dropping my new mostly stock engine (bumped it up to 1600 instead of
1500)  for a 65 this weekend.  It's locked up :( Hopefully when I drop it I
can figure out what's wrong, but if not I plan on installing the 12 volt
engine from my 71 as the 65 has kick ass heat and the 71 has none.

What components should I remove from the 6v engine to put on the 12 volt?
The 12 volt engine is a 1600 DP with a generator. The 6V engine is a 1600sp

All I can think of off the top of my head is:
generator
coil

Any help would be appreciated because if I can't fix the engine I am sending
it back to the rebuilder and won't be able to get anymore parts off it.

Thanks in advance,
Snoopy
