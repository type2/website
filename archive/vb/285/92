All,

Another article along these lines is
http://www.offroadvw.net/tech/wes/black.html .  This documents a test a
guy did with bare metal, black painted, and oil-gunked cylinders to
figure out which ones dissipated heat the best.  I think that the iron
cylinders don't have as much casting flash as the aluminum-magnesium
heads, but a similar test rig might answer the question about head
casting flash.
