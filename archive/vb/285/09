Hi Bill,
We would love to run oil pressure and temp gauges while driving a type 4 
engine, but so far have stuck with the earlier upright type VWAC engine.  Best you 
install these gauges and do some evaluation for yourself.  Even so there does 
not appear that much differance between these engines and the type 4, so best 
guess is the best RPMs are the same.  It is OK to RPM over 3,000 RPM for very 
short periods, especially traveling uphill and shifting up.  This is to avoid 
going below 1,500 RPM which you never want to go below except in first and 
reverse and still it is good to get above this RPM ASAP in these gears.
  Keeping our RPMs between 1,500 - 3,000 RPM and below 220F oil temp our 
engine lifespans went from 30,000-40,000 to 80,000+, plus MPG went from 18-19 to 
23!
