Subject: Misfire help needed on my '57...

Hi all,

Had a problem develop on my '57 whereby the engine starts to misfire at 
higher speeds and/or accelerating - kind of like there's not enough gas 
getting through or there's a bad spark.   Here's what I've checked:

Stripped and cleaned the carb (28 PIC) and all fuel system
Timing if fine and is advancing on the vacuum
Plugs are fine
The motor idles just fine

now here's the weird bit - it's ok until I've done a few miles then the 
problem starts (manual choke so that's not sticking) and even more weird 
is that the problem "fixes" itself sometimes...

any help would be appretiated

Lee
