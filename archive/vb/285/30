Thanks
A really well organized site!! kudos to the host.
I found alot of chatter about the "Liberator" series from Walmart. All of
what
I found concerned 14" rims. Mine are 15" bus rims
Local VW people have recommended
205 X 75  15's. Any experience out there with this tire and/or tire size on
a 66 Split Window??
Thanks
