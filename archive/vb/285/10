Subject: Matchbox 20 Question> VW related or not?

I am not up to speed on the collectable toys, the band or for that much
anylonger VW trivia.

Question 1: What is the origin of the name Matchbox 20?

Question 2: What are the numbers of the most common Matchbox (trademark)
(Original) TypeI and TypeII vehicles? Do not include references to
recent/current products advertised on Matchbox.com website.

No bet, money or pride on the line. Just curious.

Thanks,
