Barring dirt in the jets, I would opt for a vacuum leak. Don't set aside the
possibility that it is in the intake manifold.

You might check the vac can on your 010, Oh, is it missing? Did it fall off
during the trip? heh heh

Just got back from the last trip of the year in the Westy (more than likely)
and I guess I have to pull the carb apart again.

Idle was set at 850prm, mixture adjusted, 7.5 BTDC on a 010 and halfway to
Mendocino, it wouldn't idle.

I thought I would try to put the jets in it from my old carb as the only
problem with it was that the shaft was loose.

Any other ideas?
