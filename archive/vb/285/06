It was 20 years back, I'm certain the products are
vastly
improved.
 The engine was side mounted it drove two gear mounted
mandrels with hydraulics, was capable of lifting, and
rolling up the 6 feet wide X 50 yard turf, the
operator was seated above a single wheel behind & in
the center. The mandrels were 8 feet wide, with wheels
at the outer edge.
You could  drive it to the storage area, lift them 14
feet & put-em away.
