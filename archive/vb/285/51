"...negotiating over how the collective spare five minutes of family 
time is spent. I am starting to understand how these buses end up as 
neglected storage units."

My wife has absolutely no problem with me working on the Vanagon 
because it is our second car. The way I look at it is that it is a Type 
2 in disguise, and I get to continue poking around under the guise of 
doing the "right thing."

And yes, my bus is a storage unit - it is full of all the parts I've 
bought for it. ;-) I am finally getting around to putting pictures up 
on my site and am in talks with a "restoration artist" to help me start 
putting things back together and on the road.
