Subject: casting flashing/Re: [VB] my new motor - pics

When they make the heads, it seems there is a two piece mold they put together, pour the molten metal in, let it set, and pull the pieces apart.   (then machine bits)  you can see the seam horizontally around the head. 

 Now take a head and look down the fins from top or bottom, some of the metal oozed out at the seam of the mold, and sticks out a bit.  This is casting flashing, and it gets in the way of air flow.  Idea is if you clean it away, the heads will cool better.

So you can take implements of destruction and clean it away.  Drill (with some different size bits), file, and/or even a rotary power saw.  then be amazed at the pile of metal shavings you made.  Look at the head and see the gaps are cleaner and larger.  Just follow the mold lines, and get rid of that extra metal that oozed out around the seam.  Thanks to Eric of veewee111 for this tip.  I did it to the heads on the motor that's in my 61, runs cool.
