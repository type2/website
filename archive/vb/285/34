Have to admit to being a total lightweight regarding out of state shows.
 I've only been to one and that was because it was near where I was
going.  I've never driven my bus to an out of state show.  Young kids
are my excuse...lame I know.

OTOH, I did make it to Bad Camberg and drag my wife on a wild one day
trip up to Belgium so I'm not totally opposed to some adventure! 
Germany was great, I even got to indulge in my fast side in a 140 mph
turbo/diesel A4.
