 Everett needs to start another cat in the gallery for
VW powered equipment. Ricks weed sprayer, snow cats,
saw mills, refer truck units, fire pumps, generators,
tractors, Zambonies and all the other VW powered
equipment out there.

I have a friend who has an original VW powered
forklift and has been using it for thirty plus years
and never had the engine out!
