Hello Guys   I use a interior lite from a bus like Clara but  I glued a 
magnet on the back of it and have about 4 feet of wire so that I can move it around 
and  stick it where it works the best, when done I wrap the wire around it 
and put it back in the tool box.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import
