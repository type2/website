Subject: ADMIN: And we'r back!

Looks like they got the server fired up about 21 hours ago and forgot to
tell me...of course, no one expected 2day to arrive overnight. Way to go
FedEx!


There may be some brief outages tomorrow while I work out some other
issues, but for now we're up and good!

Thanks everyone for your patience and, of course, donations. :)

...david
