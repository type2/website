Back in the 50's-- 60's--there was an accessory lamp available from GM
that worked when you opened the hood---or deck lid.
It clipped to the underside of whichever place you ordered it---and it
also popped off and had a wire on a reel inside the lamp--so you cold
use it at night as a trouble light- the bracket mounted to the underside
of whatever--and the light clipped to it--pretty neat--

My 63 ans 64 Bonnvevilles both had them--

They are still available--you just have to do some sniffing around--
not really expensive either--maybe 20 --30 bucks.

----------------------------------------------
The PO of my DC had installed a mercury switch bulb holder on the inside
of my deck lid. Its wired to my running lights, so if they are on and
you lift the lid, the light goes on...close it and it goes off. Just
like your refrig, but no mechanical extra switches...it just works:-)
Are these still available?? A very useful and cool accessory.
----------------------------------------------
    Im not sure about a mercury switch bulb holder but i know a
mercury switch would be something that could be sourced from a car alarm
place. They used to
use them as hood and rear trunk switches to tell when its open. (one car
i had
with such a setup, youd hit the brakes and the interior light would come
on becuase the mercury flying around, funny) My 97 che*vy truck has a
simular light
thing under the hood that turns on when the hood is open and it has a
little reel
and a length of wire, id imagine it wouldnt be too hard to find a later
model
chevy truck in a junkyard to source this whole shabang from.. jasonw
p.s. personally im a member of the mag light in the mouth club..
