I don't know if you can get them at the parts store, but the junkyard
will have them...most non-entry-level American cars have them.  They may
not be mercury anymore, but they are still tilt-sensitive.  If you're at
the junkyard, look under the hoods of Ford and GM pickups...  some of them
had (have?) underhood lights that have a little cable reel on them, so you
can pull the light out and look around with it.

Be sure it will shut off when vertical on a closed Bus engine lid instead
of when nearly horizontal on a closed American car hood... you may have
to make up a little L bracket to get it to work.  6 V people, look for one
that takes a standard bayonet base bulb, as it's easy to find a 6 V bulb
for these.

Another way to do it is to install a plunger switch in the door jamb,
like the dome light switches on later VWs.  On these, the switch usually
only has one connection that goes to ground - you wire from the battery
or voltage regulator positive, through a fuse, to the supply wire of
the engine compartment light.  The ground wire of the light goes to the
plunger switch.  If the light is designed to ground through its mounting
screws, you must insulate it from the Bus sheet metal and use a ring
terminal under one of the screws for a ground wire.

If you really want to get fancy, install a SPDT toggle switch so that
the light can either get power from the battery or from the wire from
the coil to distributor - flip the switch one way and it's a work light;
flip it the other way and it's a timing light.
