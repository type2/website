Interesting.  Do you have any info on whether Berg did tests on leaving 
flashing there vs. removed?  

While the fan will blow as much air, what's in the path of the air affects 
where it goes.  Like, some of the air could go through the heater box channels 
instead of over the heads.  If the flashing blocks the fin gap, which is where 
it tends to be, that'd block air flowing through there.  It also seems to 
reduce effective surface area to me. I mean heat transfer is dependent on not just 
surface area but air flow (and some other things).   It would already be a 
turbulent (swirly) air flow situation anycase. 

bottom line on getting heads done is you pay for the work done.  extra work, 
like cleaning flashing or porting heads, is extra $$$$$
