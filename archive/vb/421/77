Yeah, that happened to me, but it scared me! I was on my first drive
after resurrecting the bus. One of the "selling features" was that the
bus had new tires.... but it sat outdoors in the sun several years
with the engine out. Well, I had my suspicions, but not willing to
waste new tires if there was a chance they were good, I left them on.
Well, on the first trip I was on the peak of Hwy 36 on the way to the
coast when the bus started wobbling from side to side. My first
thought was the wheel was coming off the axle. When I stopped, I saw
the huge swollen area on the right front tire. Fuel pump decided to
die at the same time. Luckily there was a junk yard a mile around the
bend. They pulled an old Nissan electric pump for me. It died when I
reached town on the coast. While the gas station sold me a new tire, I
walked a couple of doors down to the Napa for a Faucet fuel pump. Good
times, good times...... !!!
