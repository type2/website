Subject: Re: [VB] DP intake gaskets

The thought of a leak crossed my mind, so I made sure that both the head and 
the intake sealing surfaces were flat and clean before installing the 
aluminum gaskets. I had to sand the intake surfaces to smooth them off. Did 
so with fine sand paper on a granite flat.

Clara, the composition gaskets are about 1/16" thick vs. the aluminum at 
about 1/64" thick. I would go with the aluminum being more thermally 
conductive by a long shot.

I've been thinking anyway as I have watched this thread. Walter at Bus
Boys had an engine burn up because the OEM style tin gasket leaked.
After that he swore he would never use that type again.

   Cold manifolds tend to ice up, which makes the engine run poorly.
  That is why they have heat risers and chokes and pre-heat on the
aircleaner.

 But I don't think the gasket will insulate much, really.
