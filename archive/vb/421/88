Subject: new motor, old woes (long)

Sorry, in the interest of brevity (HAH), i left out some important bits:

Single port motor. Brand new Aurora wires and NGK plugs... forget the 
number, think a b6hs.
Dizzy is from the late Mexican motors, 205 ZB.  Timed 7.5 BTDC; 
haven't measured the at-speed advance yet as it has been either 
raining or snowing for 3 weeks here!
Stock oil bath. Adjusted per spec.

I did adjust all the carb screws per spec.  I need to dig out my 
pressure guage and check fuel pressure. I will need to play with jets 
some more - just waiting on weather.
