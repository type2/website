Subject: Stories of Life and Adventure with the VW Bus

Hi, folks--

I'm collecting stories for an anthology that I hope to get published 
in 2010: "Stories of Life and Adventure with the VW Bus." I've been 
working on this project off and on for a couple years, but I aim to 
finish it later this year.
Although I have about 25 stories so far, some long and some short, 
I'm still looking for tales of travel adventure; tidbits of daily 
life with a VW Bus; memories of your first sighting of a Bus; the 
first Bus you ever owned; stories of Bus enthusiasm passed down from 
generation to generation--anything related to the glories & 
predicaments of VW Busing. Photos and artwork are welcome. Word 
length can be from 200 to 3000, whatever is sufficient to tell your tale.

I would be grateful for any leads to other material.

Please contact me if you need more info.
