i haven't looked that far into the 3-way's to know the answer to this. 
what i know about propane tells me it would need a vent.  my plan is for 
solar, so 2-way will be the route i go probably.

not sure.  best is subjective.  i like the truckfridge and i also like 
the portable engel.  i'm considering the engel behind the passenger 
seat.  i'm thinking of building a bench over it and installing a 
seatbelt.  sorta of jump seat style.

i also have plans to visit my local RV salvage shop to look at their 
used products.
