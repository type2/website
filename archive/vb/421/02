The flaps are the same
it is just the connecting bar that is different.
The spring is the same.

the upright cooler bar is more straight.

the doghouse cooler bar has little adaptors on each flap, with clips to hold
them on and then the bar has some bends in it.
That is to clear the doghouse cooler.
I have also seen a 1 piece bar for doghouse (different bends, or additional
bends), but not sure how the fit is.

It is possible to make something, but you do want it to fit just right, so I'd
get some original VW parts.

In the 56 westy we just drove from WA to FL the heat was so hot that I could
not keep my hand on the tubes under the dash, when it was probably in the 40s
outside.   It does have the thermostat hooked up, and the tube under the bus
was heavily insulated by the PO who lived in Montana

Here is a search for "thermostat" on the samba classifieds:

I see an ad for flaps with the doghouse flap adaptors on, maybe they would
sell it separately, and an ad for the doghouse connector bar for $10.

Clara, et al,
Thanks for all the replies. Does anyone know if the flaps are the same
hether its a dog house or not? Maybe just the connecting bars are
ifferent? If that is all, I supposes I could dig some up or make something.
