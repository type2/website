>>The 15" rim is only 4" wide and the 14" isn't much better at 4.5" (IIRC).<<


 Hi Tom,
Type 1 rims are 4" wide.

  While the type two ran after MAR55 15" x 4.5" wide, and for 1963 and later
one ton suspension 14" x 5" wide.

  Type 2s up till FEB55 have a rim width of 16 x 3.5"!!!

All figures above taken from "Without Guesswork".


 Have heard same warnings and gotten over 250,000 miles on our 15" x 4.5" so
far without failure except once.  When we carried a heavy load in our SC while
running wimpy Type 1 style 165R15s and got hit by a nasty side wind.
So far as we are concerned as long as you run properly load weighted (1525
Lbs. or more) tires you are not going to have any problem with our lighter
less HP VWs than compared to the USA made trucks.  Plus with the stiffer
heavier load rated tires you have lots less problem with side winds!
