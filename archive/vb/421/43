Subject: Celebrity VW Bus Owners?

Hi, Folks--

I'm wondering if anyone knows of any
"celebrities" who own an old bus. The kind of
celebrity that gets in People or Us.

On a friend's advice, I'm looking for a story, or
a blurb, from someone like that to put into the
anthology I'm editing: Bus Love: Stories of Life and Adventure with the VW
Bus.

I have about 20 stories now; some short, some long. There's room for more.

Also, if anyone would like a pdf file of the
color version of the latest Old Bus Review, let
me know and I'll send it to you.

Tom

Got a VW Bus Story you'd like to share?
Do you know someone else who does?

A collection of stories of life and adventure
with the VW Bus is coming together! Were looking
for tales of travel adventure; tidbits of daily
life with a VW Bus; memories of your first
sighting of a Bus; the first Bus you ever owned;
weddings and celebrations where VW Buses held a
prominent position; stories of Bus enthusiasm
passed down from generation to
generation-anything related to the glories (and
predicaments) of VW Busing. Photos and artwork are welcome.

If you have material you'd like to contribute, or
for more information, please contact Tom
