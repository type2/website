I've been thinking anyway as I have watched this thread. Walter at Bus
Boys had an engine burn up because the OEM style tin gasket leaked.
After that he swore he would never use that type again.

   Cold manifolds tend to ice up, which makes the engine run poorly.
  That is why they have heat risers and chokes and pre-heat on the
aircleaner.

 But I don't think the gasket will insulate much, really.
