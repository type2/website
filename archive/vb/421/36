I can't find the ZDDP level listed for that oil on the Castrol site. I did see
the disclaimer that itB does not meet the catalyst compatibility requirements
of vehicles manufactured since 1993, whic h is a good sign. At least a major
manufacturer now has something on the shelf for our use.

Hey Lou! Long time no see!

I think ZDDP has a maximum content per environmental regulations now.
An article I read about ZDDP on a muscle car site said even
Valvoline's so-called racing oil conforms to the ZDDP limit and that
you had to buy the one labelled "not for street use" to get past the
limit.
