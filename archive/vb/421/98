Ya, carb icing should not be an issue in a dry area like So Cal.
 However, it is still important to have the thermostat set up whatever the
climate.
 Berg said with the engine warming up quicker there was less wear on the
engine.

Checked the oil on my driver combi yesterday, and it looked like mayonnaise at
the cap.   It does have the thermostat and pre-heat.
 I am usually taking short trip in it is the thing... just maybe 4-6 miles
there, and same back., so the engine does not have time to warm up properly
and drive out the moisture.   I'll have to take it for a longer drive on the
freeway and get it warmed up for longer.

The weather around here right now is highs about 50F, lows about 40F, and
intermittantly raining.
 That is prime carb icing conditions.   :)

Clara,
Thanks for the clear, concise description of the carb icing problem. Now I
nderstand why all that stuff is on the engine, thermostat with flaps and
reheat hose. Good thing I live in So. Cal. The icing problem is minimal.
