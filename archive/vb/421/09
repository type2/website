Subject: Re: [VB] DP intake gaskets

I didn't use to use anything on my spark plugs, but one day I was reading one
of those Bentley VW workdshop manuals, it was a 70s beetle one suitable for
1600 engines, and it said under no circustances install the spark plugs dry.
shame on me!!!!

When I cleaned the plugs on my truck the other days I used antiseize on the
threads, and dielectric grease where the plug wires snap on.

About gaskets,  I would think you do want the heat to transfer from the heads
to the manifolds.
   Cold manifolds tend to ice up, which makes the engine run poorly.
 That is why they have heat risers and chokes and pre-heat on the aircleaner.

But I don't think the gasket will insulate much, really.
