Subject: Re: [VB] tire size

Hi William,
	The stock tire size would now be metric vs the previous inch ones  
and is 185 R 14 C.  205/75R14 might work fine if you could fit them  
under the rear wheel wells.  They'd be a tad taller than stock and a  
lot wider.  I doubt that they will fit without a song and dance in  
the rear of a '66 unless the wheel wells were already cut?
	I had a Michelin LTX 195/75 14 blow out friday on the rear of my  
turd brown '84 Vanagon.  Turd handled fine during the blow and this  
was not a scary scene. They looked almost new but were 8 years old.   
I cannot say 100% that they were properly inflated but I had checked  
them recently and it was 48 psi.
	Looking for new tires myself, 14 inch Vanagon tires are the same  
size as your '66 bus uses, I noticed that Van-Cafe sells 185 R 14 C  
Nokian tires for $109 plus shipping and so on.  I've spent quite a  
bit of time in Finland and the finns make good stuff.  Anyone have  
experience with these tires?  Tire Rack sells Yokohama 185 R 14 D  
tires for $82.  These would fit great and have a good safety factor  
for load.  I don't know how well they handle or wear....
