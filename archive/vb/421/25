You will be hard pressed to find an off the shelf oil with a high ZDDP content
these days. The last oils to have it were the CI rated diesel oils. Our local
engine builder uses Joe GibbsB break inB oil in all the flat tappet engines he
builds. GM used to sell an engine oil supplement that went NLA but rereleased
it under a different name. I am running Brad Penn oils in my flat tappet
vehicles.
