Subject: 40 hp woes ... 

So now that I have the 1600 finally installed I have a spare 40 hp engine
that has like 8,000 mi on it since rebuilt. One of the long studs that
fasten the heads to the block stripped at the block . what's the best way to
fix this .. I was looking for super studs but looks like they are impossible
to find .. 

 

TIA
