It was interesting reading Nate's report on crappy floats in new  
carbs.  I haven't really dealt with the new carbs yet but I'd like to  
add crappy new float needle valves from carb repair kits to the crap  
carb parts list.  I don't know if I've ever seen a new float needle  
valve that worked properly.  Keeping the fuel pump pressure around 3  
psi will help....   Gary
