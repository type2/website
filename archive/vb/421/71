Subject: finally ... 

So I finally got a 1600 in my 60 .. it seems to work well with the small nut
transaxle ... I have no problem cruising at 60 mph which is exactly where I
want to be .. I just wanted to do the speed limit on the 400 series highways
.. now I'm there ... I also get up to cruising speed much quicker with the
1600 vs the 40 hp engine. 

 

 

 

I really like this set up ... i got the 1600 from Scott at German Supply and
a 6 volt flywheel made by Rimco ...  my 6 volt starter was recently rebuilt
... so the cost of the 6 volt flywheel being made is sort of offset by not
needing a new 12 V starter ... 

 

 

 

The Rolf-man says my manual choked carb that came from busdepot a year or so
ago is 'f(-at-)C*ing junk' ...  I was using it on the 40 hp engine ... but I
really liked that manual choke .. I liked pulling out the knob and knowing
it functioned ... I may put that carb back in and get rid of that automatic
choked carb  ... I also might put the oil bath air cleaner back in ... I
like the way it looks in the engine bay ... and that chrome thing looks
kinda silly ... ;)

 

 

 

Anyway ... I'm really stoked with this power ... the old 60 never ran so
well or so fast ;) - I really have no urge to go any faster .. 60's fine ;)

 

 

 

So what about that support thing on the motor from the 71 bus ... will that
fit in any bay to install a type 1 engine in late bay ... or will it only
work for a 71?
