Subject: Re: [VB] tire size

Hi folks,
	The tire topic is new again!  Try finding a replacement tire on the  
road for your bus or beetle.  The choice is small and the local tire  
marts won't stock them.  I suppose that this is not all bad.  It'll  
force us to evaluate the condition of our tires better before we hit  
the road.  Gary
