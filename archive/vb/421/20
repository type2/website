Subject: detergent vs. non-detergent

just a quick check - are folks still insisting on mon-detergent oil 
for break-in?  wilson's book shows a can of regular oil being poured 
in, but i've always heard (and always used) ND.  sadly, i haven't 
been able to find it nearby with out a special order!

plus, a previous tenant of the house left a case of castrol gtx 
10/50w, and using  it would be an easy way to get rid of it  :)
