Another splitty is alive!

You all might remember the one owner, all original '65 Deluxe I bought
almost two years ago. Well, moving at my usual lightening pace, I got
right on it and got it running just as quickly as I could. To my
amazement I beat two years, but not by much. I drove it today. That's
the first time it has moved under it's own power in around twenty years.
The license plate on it is from 1989. The tires are from before it was
parked, so I didn't get out of sight of my driveway. They felt like they
might blow at any moment. Otherwise, it was a pretty good ride.
