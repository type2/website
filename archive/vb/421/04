Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] DP intake gaskets

I would think that Gene was worried about the electrical insulating 
properties of the anti-sieze rather than the thermal insulation.

Hi Chris,
Interesting that you though of the insulating issues with metal vs
fiber gaskets where the intake manifolds bolt up to the heads.  Gene
Berg use to recommend not using anti-seize on spark plugs because it
would insulate the plugs from the heads....
