Subject: Re: [VB] M-Code

On my bus, the M-code sticker was situated behind the passenger seat on the 
non-walk-thru partition. Could be the sticker is long gone. Mine is. It got 
painted over somewhere along the years and couldn't be stripped without 
removing the print. :-(

Where is the the M-Code located for a 61 Single Cab? Since I can't look
behind the bulkhead
I looked on the Samba and VintageBus and I couldn't find that info.
