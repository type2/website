Subject: tire size

Hancook makes a special load rated 14 inch tire. i have a set on my 67
westy and they are wonderful---- highly recommend. you can special order them
thru discount tire here in texas coz they carry hancooks. you need to speak to
manager or someone in the know. i forget the model name and my camper is in
another state right now but this list has talked about these hancooks before.
Remember you dont pay a special mounting fee when you order them thru discount
tire just gotta wait a cpl of days for em to come in.
