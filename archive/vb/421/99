Subject: CHEAP Bosch H4 Headlights

I just got an incredible deal on the Bosch H4 headlights that are widely
recommended for use on Buses. This is one of the easiest, cheapest upgrades
you can make to your Bus.  See Richard Atwell's excellent writeup at
<http://www.ratwell.com/technical/BoschH4.html>.  

I have these coming in under a week.  They usually run $90-$100 a pair.  I'm
offering a List Member Only pre-order price of $39.95 a PAIR (not each!) if
you order them now for shipment upon arrival. They will come up at $44.95,
but to get the lower price put LIST H4 DEAL in the "comments" section of the
checkout page when ordering.  The website will not reflect the additional
discount but we will deduct it when we actually charge your order. I'll hold
this price until January 22, then it's $44.95 (which is still half price).

These don't come with bulbs, but I got a deal on those too - $3.95 each for
German 60/55w bulbs. Order them here:

For those running 6 volt Splitty electrics, email me if you'd like 6 volt
bulbs. If there's enough demand I can order some in (they're about twice the
price of the 12 volt bulbs).
