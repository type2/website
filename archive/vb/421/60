Ted,, a couple questions.. what is high ZDDP content ?  say relative to the
5 numbers listed below...
you typed CI rated oils,,, did you mean CL ?

Hot Vw's just printed an article..

"Dyno Testing 20W50 Performance oils"
they tested for HP, oil pressure, oil temp.
but in the end, as it was a short term test,, couldn't tell if there was any
internal engine benifits, or detriments using these oil.. and didn't really
speak of longevity other than a warning at the end of the article.. "during
a teardown, [if you find] your cam and lifters, crank bearings and cylinders
look better than before, then by all means, continue to use it. just beware
[about initial break in periods not to use this type of oils]"
This article is from a racing point of view, and talks about using 0 weight
oils, to 20W50... but a regular street acvw engine would use 10W30

so,, i didn't get an answer for use in a bus engine on day to day usage for
longevity of the engine... they seemed to addresss temps , pressure, and hp.
I think any oil used today will maintain pressure ,, low temps, and not
deter from engine hp  - of course till it is contaminated. oil breakdown,,
or engine wear would have to come from a long term test.

Lucas oil synthetic racing 0.08% zddp content  www.lucasoil.com
Red line synthetic 0.13% zddp content www.redlineoil.com

Their bottom line,  "there is only a slight difference from one to another"

wouldn't it be nice if we could find a data logger that would record head
temps, oil temps, rpm, throttle position, speed, time, and after so many
hours ,, drop the oil and have it tested for wear particles,,
contamination,,  oh,, and be less than $100?
