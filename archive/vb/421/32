Hey Lou! Long time no see!

I think ZDDP has a maximum content per environmental regulations now.
An article I read about ZDDP on a muscle car site said even
Valvoline's so-called racing oil conforms to the ZDDP limit and that
you had to buy the one labelled "not for street use" to get past the
limit.

 Castrol 20w-50 Syntec, "Specially Formulated for Classic Cars". full synthetic
 loaded with ZDDP.
 I found it on the shelf at NAPA and at Wal Mart.
 Black bottle with yellow/red band at the top where it says for 'classic
 cars'.

 $6+ at Wal Mart.
