Subject: Re: [VB] Tire Size and Rim Width (was Re: [VB] tire size)

I have an early 64 with 15" rims. Looks to me like the pickens for 15" tires 
is very slim these days. My tires are getting old as they have been on my 
bus since 2001. Only about 8000 miles on them however. Yes I know, time to 
dump them for some new ones that will not explode on the freeway.

My existing tires are Bridgestone Duelers. No longer available in 205-75/R15 
( at least per their web site). No problems with fit or rubbing anywhere. I 
do get a lot of compliments on the tires at the shows. The tread has a very 
nice look and they run fairly smooth and quietly.

As an aside, what are people's concerns about tire widths?

The 15" rim is only 4" wide and the 14" isn't much better at 4.5" (IIRC).

Many of the tires available for our rim sizes claim a minimum rim width
of 5", especially 205/7x, 215/7x, and above.  This only makes sense (the
width of the tire is increasing) but yet I've heard of many folks running
these tires on their buses on stock width rims.

Is this a concern?

In the short term I decided to stick with 195R14's and 185R14's just
to keep myself "safe" but I'm curious and I'd really love to move to the
15" rims i have, given the chance.
