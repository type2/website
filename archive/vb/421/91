Craig,

I hope that you've gotten it sorted out by now but I'd like to add  
something since your poor running when starting up sounds so much like  
mine -  it may be of help, if not now perhaps at some other time.

The low voltage wires wires to and from the distributor were attached  
with push on connectors.  Both the + and - connectors were loose.  At  
speed the vibration of the engine/connectors was such that the  
connections were both OK.  At slow speed, such as starting up the  
vibrations made the connections terrible and it ran in that manner.   
It was almost as if the fuel had water in it.  I crimped the female  
connectors just a little and slipped them back on the coil - ran great.

I had a similar poor at idle or starting up and good at speed  
situation and that time it was a loose plug wire.

May your problem be so minor :-)

Pat
