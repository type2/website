Subject: Re: [VB] Celebrity VW Bus Owners?

I always feel like a celebrity when I drive my bus.  I figure that's why
everyone waves at me 8^)

Anyway, I was curious, so I did a web search on celebrity + VW bus, and
turned up a photo of Ewan McGregor getting into a green splitty Westy.
The caption labeled is as "their classic VW Bus."  FWIW...

Rusty
67 Westy
