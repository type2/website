Subject: 12 fridge .... 

There is supposed to be a 12 volt fridge on the market (maybe 12 v/110 v) .
that is supposed to be about the best you can get. I think they cost around
$700.00 U.S.  I'm in the process of laying out the camper interior for my 60
and I'm thinking about one of those fridges . anyone know the manufacturer
of em? 

 

TIA
