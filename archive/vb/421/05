Subject: Re: [VB] DP intake gaskets

Another thought on the anti-seize. The compound is loaded with graphite and 
copper particles. Likely rendering it fairly conductive, especially once the 
spark plug is tightened up. I always use A-S compound on my spark plugs. 
Always easy out and easy in.

Hi Chris,
Interesting that you though of the insulating issues with metal vs
fiber gaskets where the intake manifolds bolt up to the heads.  Gene
Berg use to recommend not using anti-seize on spark plugs because it
would insulate the plugs from the heads....
