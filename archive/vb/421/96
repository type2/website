Craig,

I have installed a lot of the H30/31 carbs in clients cars at my shop,
but the one problem ALL have is the float.  Pull the top off and look
at the float.  If it's BLACK, it's the late style float that the
Brazilians are using and it's a heavy POS.  Basically it won't float
so you run super rich no matter what your jetting.  It's like having
the float set too high and fuel spills un-metered through the main jet.

What I do on EVERY carb I install is to replace the float with an old
style white plastic float from a 34pict-3.  When you compare the
weight difference, you'll see why the stock float sinks!!  Change it
out for one of these, re-set the float level and I'm sure the over
rich problem will be in the past.

Like I said, I take apart the brand new carbs and switch the floats
before I ever run them, because I've been down this road too many times.

You may find that the rough running is due to being super rich and not
to other mechanical or electric things at all.  A rich runner runs
rough (say that five times fast) ;-).  Hope this helps. . .  Good Luck!!
