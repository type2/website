Sorry, I must disagree
 on both 61& earlier and the 62 & later buses, they were painted lower color,
then upper color.
 It is just that on the 62 ons there was upper color on the inside as well as
the outside

66 deluxe, showing Titian red under beige grey:

Here is a 63 standard.   There was some black rattle can horror done, which is
mostly cleaned off in this pic:
You can see clearly the SWR under the beige grey on the headlight bucket:

on the same 63 bus, you can see where the red is showing through about the
belt:

 Hi Conrad,
es, somewhere after about the change over to 1962 model year the buses were
hen painted the top color inside and out.  Then the lower color was painted
nly on exterior.
  Before 1962 the bus was painted inside and out with lower color and then
the
op was painted the upper color.
