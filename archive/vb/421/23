Main benefit thereof today craig would be ND would likely be "presumeably"
with a bunch more ZDDP.  Wally World up here had it last fall when I went
looking, but I bought oil for 4 cars changes the other day and don't recall
seeing it, but wasn't looking specifically.  If you can't find it, I'd use a
good straight 30W with a good ZDDP additive (ZDDP Plus) and even if you do
find it, I'd still use the ZDDP additive cause who knows WTF is really in what
you buy.  The ZDDP Plus (available at better FLAPS) is cheaper than using a
pricey breakin oil, but that is reasonable as well, the Royal Purple breakin
stuff is everywhere for in$tance.  I wouldn't personally use that wide of a
spectrum multiviscosity oil (your free case) in a VW air cooled engine
period,  but that is just me, YMMV.  With a ZDDP additive, for as long as
breakin oil will be in there, probably doesn't matter, but anything with a 10W
in it has always been too thin a base oil in my
 book.  Again long argued and YMMV.  And shit I just put the new Rotella
synthetic 5W-40 in my Bobcat yesterday, 5W base in a stinking diesel !!!! 
(but it is synthetic, and it was -10F when I did it.)
