Subject: Admin help needed - Please get Expedia off the list

Admin folks. You may not be aware of this if you haven't posted lately, 
but we have an expedia.com customer service email address as a list 
member that needs to be removed. It sends you an auto-reply after you 
post. Send a post to the list and you'll get the response, then you'll 
see what I mean.

John
