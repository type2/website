Subject: Re: [VB] tire size

205/75r14 should fit if you want to run it.  Largest 14" tire that  
will fit is 27x8.5 (general makes a knockoff of and older bfg in this  
size).  Any taller and you'll hit the rear of the front tire up front  
In bumps, wider you'll rub the springplate inthe rear

I gave up on stockisg sizes this last time around, got tired of  
highway ribs :(
