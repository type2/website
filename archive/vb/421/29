Subject: Tire Size and Rim Width (was Re: [VB] tire size)

As an aside, what are people's concerns about tire widths?

The 15" rim is only 4" wide and the 14" isn't much better at 4.5" (IIRC).

Many of the tires available for our rim sizes claim a minimum rim width
of 5", especially 205/7x, 215/7x, and above.  This only makes sense (the
width of the tire is increasing) but yet I've heard of many folks running
these tires on their buses on stock width rims.

Is this a concern?

In the short term I decided to stick with 195R14's and 185R14's just 
to keep myself "safe" but I'm curious and I'd really love to move to the
15" rims i have, given the chance.

Cheers,
