Hi Craig,

Thanks for the detailed post. That is the kind of experience we need
to hear. Sorry it has you discouraged enough to drive you away from
VW. I had a great mentor on my only engine build which came out
perfect, and I've always had great luck sourcing good used and recent
rebuilds from swap meets and neighbors.

I can pretty much say that in my experience such a serious problem
with running rich is not a matter of carb adjustment but rather of
some malfunction causing a serious leak and flooding. The cause can
vary, but some things that can cause this are a leak in the float
causing it to fill with fuel and not cutting off the flow through the
needle valve, excessive fuel pressure overcoming the needle valve, an
old and hardened needle sealing surface that is not sealing, dirt
preventing the needle from sealing, and unnoticed tears in internal
diaphragms. Others more experienced than me may know other causes. I
wouldn't waste time on jets until the carb is working right. Jets may
fine tune for you, but the standard setup should be close enough that
this is not the cause of your troubles.

Best of luck and keep us posted,

John

 Sorry, in the interest of brevity (HAH), i left out some important bits:

 I did adjust all the carb screws per spec.  I need to dig out my pressure
 guage and check fuel pressure. I will need to play with jets some more -
 just waiting on weather.
