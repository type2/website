Subject: Re: [VB] Karl's 66 Deluxe - Ouch!

It may be premature to declare the '66 dead, but out here on the left coast buses are plentiful! We keep the humidity down so they last a lot longer. You folks back east and in the PNW should try it. ;)

I'll drive the '63 doublecab to OCTO and the Classic. It's for sale again!
