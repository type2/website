Subject: Re: [VB] RE: oil temp.

I think you are on the right track. The warmest part of the engine would be
inside the combustion chamber. The location between the top of the piston
and the inside of the head near the exhaust valve too. After that the heat
conducts through the metal to all the other parts.
