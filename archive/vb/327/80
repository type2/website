Subject: Re: [VB] Interior handles

Buses came with plastic escutcheons in the front, and chrome ones for the 
cargo doors.

Cargo door... panel... spring (light) ... chrome ring..handle
Front doors... spring or foam square...panel... ring...handle

I think the ones with screws for the front door inner handle had foam squares 
with hole cut for the handle to go through,

 the pin handles had pretty hurky springs.
