Subject: anyone going to OCTO from Boise?

Hey gang. 
There's a bus driver's side door (lower shell) in
Boise that I'm trying to get over here in So. Cal.
I was wondering if there's anyone from Boise or headed
through there on the way to the (June 12) OCTO show?
In return for gas money/beer/free T-shirt/wampum?
Takers?
