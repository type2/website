Subject: Re: [VB] Piston Pin Bushing

you can remove the rods without breaking the case... use an extension on your 
ratchet.  keep the rods and their caps together.. don't mix and match.. and 
mark which came from #1, #2, etc. 
  Install new rod bearings.  Take a rod off and the old bearing (little half 
circle thing) will tell you what size to buy.

I was hoping to install a new set of P&C without breaking open the case.
However, in reading through the Tom Wilson book it says the piston pin
bushings in the end of the rods must be pressed in and machined to fit the new
piston pin.  If this is the case I guess that means you can't install new P&C
without breaking the case?
