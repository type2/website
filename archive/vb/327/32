Hi Harry,
Good point, but also these engines were designed in Germany which has cool 
weather more like British Columbia Canada during the summer and winter weather 
more like Alaska!  Same overheating situation happened with Soviet designed and 
made bulldozers when they helped Egypt build the Answar (SP?) dam across the 
Nile!
  If you ever have a chance take a look at 356 Porsche heads and cylinders in 
comparison to 40HP thru 1600cc of these parts.  Huge differance in fin 
amounts and in an official Porsche repair manual we have it states that running the 
Porsche engine at too high of RPMs as a norm will turn an engine that should 
be good for 100,000 miles into needing rebuilding at 40,000 miles, but they 
never mention the best cruising RPM.
  Also most volks do not keep in mind the torque of the engine and only focus 
on HP.  Torque is what is going to get you up and over that long steep road 
and/or get that heavy load moving in your bus.  If you take a look at the 
1963-67 Workshop Manual VW Transporter, section M-30, page 5, there is a great 
graph that shows by 3,500 RPM the torque has fallen way off.  Even though this 
graph is for the 40 HP engine the later engine are not that much differant.
