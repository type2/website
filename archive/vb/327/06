Hi Dave,

Put one end of the clear tube into the engine compartment. tape it to the
fan shroud, not too close to the fan so that it doesn't affect the reading.
I like to put the end near the ignition coil on the shroud.

Run the other end of the tubing up to the drivers seat and stick it into a
glass of water. If the water pulls up the tube, you have vacuum, if the air
will push down into the water, you have pressure.

Not split bus, but I found my 79 Westy would pull water about 1 1/2" up the
tube when at a standstill with the motor at 4000rpm. But doing that same
4000rpm at 75mph, the 'scoop' of the intakes actually creates enough
pressure in the engine bay to push air down about 3/8" into the water. My
old 64 bus (1600DP) had a lot of engine bay vacuum, and I couldn't go more
than 7 miles at a time down the highway while living in Vegas before my
temps got too hot. I removed the front tin that straddles the engine and
trans, and almost eliminated my engine bay vacuum completley. After that, I
couldn't overheat my engine no matter how much I tried.

This is one part of the cooling system that most people overlook. You need
pressure to push air past all those cooling fins, and if the air you're
using to create that pressure is starting out with negative pressure, the
amount of pressure the fan will create is less than if it starts with
'normal' air to begin with.
