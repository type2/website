VW 's recommended top speed was about 3500rpms.   Best cooling speed is about 
2600-2800 rpms.   

I get this from various peoples motors... from 2000 DP dual carb upright in a 
lowered bus to stock engines, with different gearings.  seems to be something 
intrinsic.  where the extra heat  balances out the extra cooling (or visa 
versa).  above and below ~26-2700 rpms the engine runs hotter.

Running at the top designed speed is also the top designed load on the 
engine, so I'd think the cooling system is optimized for that 
condition. Larger engine, faster speeds throw off all the conditions.
