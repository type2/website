You know what would be the ultimate way to do it, put a 1/8" pipe in the
shroud or cylinder tin, and measure the actual pressure inside the fan shroud
and check for changes with and without scoops and other changes to see what
happens. I don't have my split bus anymore to check that sort of thing
anymore.

That would be a direct measurement there. More pressure, more cooling. Plain
and simple.

  oh, and actually airflow through the heat vents (which I measured to assume
correlates to air blown over heads) went DOWN with scoops, though the head
temps also went down (engine air temp down)... i gotta post that stuff.  ya...
didn't test a bay though... different ball of wax i guess.

Most
