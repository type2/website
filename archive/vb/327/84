cargo doors.

Which is why I cannot find any then!  I have one repro cargo eschuteon and
that is poor quality, the centre bore is of a much bigger diameter than the
handle?

> cargo door... panel... spring (light) ... chrome ring..handle

Anyone got a picture of the spring so I have some idea of what I need to
look for?  I bought one spring but it is way too big - this was bought from
the same supplier as the poor quality repro eschuteons

> front doors... spring or foam square...panel... ring...handle

My doors have foam remnants there so I will get some more foam.  Any idea of
the thickness required?

Thanks a lot for that - very useful
