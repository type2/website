Exactly the point Gene Berg made back in the eighties. An open air dyno
test is not the same as an enclosed real life engine compartment where
you have to deal with the ventilation the factory provided you.

This is one part of the cooling system that most people overlook. You
need pressure to push air past all those cooling fins, and if the air
you're using to create that pressure is starting out with negative
pressure, the amount of pressure the fan will create is less than if it
starts with 'normal' air to begin with.
