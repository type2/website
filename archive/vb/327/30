Subject: Radio Shack VW Bus Car Stereo

About 3 years ago Radio shack did a run on the Shaft Style Mount AF/FM
Cassette Players that fit the VW Bus.  Jerry Jess posted that they were
selling them again, so I bought one for my project.  Well, since I am about to
be 'bussless' for a while I figured my now 'NOS' Radio Shack radio (that they
no longer make, part # 12-2004) could go to a good use. The list price on
these back then was $49.95.  I will sell it for $55 which includes shipping &
insurance.  Please email me off the list and I'll send pictures.  Everything
is new, appears to be complete, and is in the original box.  The box has
moving wear, but everything inside seems perfect.

Later
Charles
