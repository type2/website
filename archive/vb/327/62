Subject: Unknown shift rod seal

  Today I pulled the long shift rod out of my 1960 DD panel. The middle coupler was rusted on solid so cut it in half to 
get it off. In removing it from the long shift rod I found a little round seal. This seal was still in excellent shape and I 
have never seen this before. It appears to be a seal to keep moisture from getting into the shift rod coupler. I looked 
in my parts book to try and find it but no luck. I have a few more shift rods (early) here and am going to see if these 
have the seal also. I will take some pics and post in the Samba gallery later.
