Subject: Piston Pin Bushing

I was hoping to install a new set of P&C without breaking open the case.
However, in reading through the Tom Wilson book it says the piston pin
bushings in the end of the rods must be pressed in and machined to fit the new
piston pin.  If this is the case I guess that means you can't install new P&C
without breaking the case?
Also, the existing bushing looks like good metal with holes that correspond to
holes in the end of the rod, presumably for oil passage.  The replacements I
got have a dingy cheap metal look and are solid except for the joint which is
a wave pattern.  Are these supposed to be drilled to match the holes in the
rod to allow for oil?
Thanks!
Mike
