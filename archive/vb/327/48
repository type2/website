This may be a moot point, but if you can score a Type 3 case the mounts are the same and will save you the trouble.
But then, aint that the trouble.
They're almost harder to score than Bay 1600 cases.

Recently someone asked about using a beetle block in a bus,, and having the hanger
bar .

If there are bosses cast into the block and not drilled out, you can drill and tap
them.

There are 3 holes, I'll refer to them as 1, 2, and 3 left to right
1 and 3 are along the same plane
2 is a little over 71mm below that

If you make a template,
draw a line 190mm long
mark hole #1 center 5mm from the left end of the line
measure 178mm along the line from hole #1 center and mark hole #3 center
scribe an arc below the line from hole #1 , 104mm
scribe an arc below the line from hole #3 , 125mm
where these arc's cross is hole #2

#1 is M10X1.5 x70 stud the hole is 22mm deep 8.5mm drill bit or 21/64" worked
#2 is M8X1.25 x55 stud the hole is 28mm deep 6.8mm drill bit or 17/64" worked
#3 is M10X1.5 x70 stud the hole is 28mm deep 8.5mm drill bit or 21/64"
