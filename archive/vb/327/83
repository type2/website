J.C. Whitney (I washed my mouth out with soap) sells an adapter plate
that bolts to your oil pump in place of the cover and has a bracket tha
alligns with the three bosses. I use it to start the drill work on
drilling and tapping for a 10mm (12mm outside) threaded insert. I've
found that a lot of the bosses on the older 1500 T-1/2 blocks just
looked too small for the proper 12mm size cross member bolt nut insert
(14mm outside thread).

This may be a moot point, but if you can score a Type 3 case the mounts
are the same and will save you the trouble. But then, aint that the
trouble. They're almost harder to score than Bay 1600 cases.
