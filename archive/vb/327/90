Just a note that in addition to the quarts of POR-15, we now sell a
complete kit as well that includes these other products. This is
primarily intended for spot use, such as touch up of smaller rust areas.
It includes enough POR-15 to do "up to 12 square feet" as they
optimistically put it, depending on how heavy you lay it on. As compared
to a quart's "up to 96 square feet" this is not a huge amount, so you
may want to get two kits rather than finding yourself short. Unlike the
quarts, the kit also includes all of the prep stuff that POR-15
recommends, such as a water-based degreaser and MetalReady etcher, and
even rubber gloves and brushes. While all of these items (or something
comparable) besides the POR-15 itself can be found at any auto paint
supply house, this will save you the hassle of the trip and worrying
about getting the right stuff. For smaller jobs, this may be an easier
(and cheaper) solution than buying a quart of POR-15 plus the prep
supplies separately, only to have to store the most of the quart when
you're done. (If you do store it, make sure to reseal any unused
quantities quickly or it will go bad; i.e. pour some out to work with
rather than working right out of the open can for a long time.)

The kits are only $14.95 each.
