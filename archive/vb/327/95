Just some thoughts:

Are the valves adjusted to spec?

Did you notice anything unusual the last few times you adjusted them?  Did 
they go from rarely needing adjustment to one or two being way off?  Etc.

Can you push or pull on the flywheel and feel any endplay?  Even with the 
engine installed, you can feel it if you've got excessive endplay -- ask 
me how I know!

Before you do something like tearing down the engine, you might just want 
to take a look at the valve adjusters and push rods on the noisy side...
