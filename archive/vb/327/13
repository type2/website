oh, and actually airflow through the heat vents (which I measured to assume 
correlates to air blown over heads) went DOWN with scoops, though the head 
temps also went down (engine air temp down)... i gotta post that stuff.  ya... 
didn't test a bay though... different ball of wax i guess.

of the intake on bay windows buses make a sizeable pressure increase. Most
definitly did NOT lower engine bay pressure.

  scoops actually lower engine compartment pressure.  very slightly.
