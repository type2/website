Hint;

To increase paint hardner's usable life span  as well as the rust
converter's--put the unused portions of them in the refrigerator.

It'll cause the stuff to lay dormant and a year from now it'll still be
good.

Your wife may be unhappy---tell her your saving money--

An old trick of the trade--:>)



<< only to have to store the most of the quart when you're done. (If you
do store it, make sure to reseal any unused quantities quickly or it
will go bad; i.e. pour some out to work with rather than working right
out of the open can for a long time.)>>
The kits are only $14.95 each.
