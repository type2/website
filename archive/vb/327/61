Sounds like they 'fell off the truck' :)

-So I make this gigantic pile, which also included an
-NOS VW in the box small hatch bus interior rear view
-mirror, and a bunch of new tune pu parts, and the pile
-came out to $110. So Rachel and I load up a few
-containers with tools and start carrying them. HEAVY.
-I saw a guy who had an empty wheel barrel next to his
-truck, borrowed that, and it made the rest of the way
-much easier. Went back another time to buy more,
-filled another box with tools, $25.
-Went back at the end of the day, and bought everything
-else VW for $50. Thanks again to that guy who let me
-use his wheel barrel---twice.
