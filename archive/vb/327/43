Subject: Westy Cabinet "Pipe" molding???

Anyone know of a source for the molding that goes between the cabinet's and
door frames?
The piping type that goes between the closet and cargo door frame and at the
rear between the rear hatch and cabinet.

I've checked the archives and unless I'm using the wrong search words can't
find the info.  Did see were Boyd Smith ask a similar question some time back.
I've checked Gowesty.com,and outwater.com and all I find is the T-Molding.
