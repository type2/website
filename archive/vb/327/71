Subject: Re: [VB] 1/4inch panel for top??

Don't know if any of you guys are woodworkers but there is a product that is
"rubber core plywood"
there is a laminate on each side and the core is just that .....Rubber.
I'm not sure of the ability to resist moisture long term. But the rubber
core has to help dampen the noise and vibration.
