Subject: Re: [VB] Testing Old Thermostat

Hi Mike,
All thermostatic bellows we have, the temp they open at is stamped on them.  
A good candy thermometer is dandy and very accurate for testing the bellow for 
opening temp.  Once above that temp the bellows should be fully open.  The 
bellows can not be damaged by the water.  If there are any cracks or pin holes 
the bellows will fail because the chemical inside will leak out, the air will 
get in, and the bellow will expand to its full length whatever the temp.  
Anyone know what chemical is in these?
  Good idea to clean the bellow when expanded with old tooth brush and soap.  
Though it takes us several times of dipping into the hot water to keep it 
expanded enough to get all the grit and sand out of the corrigations that might 
cause the bellow to fail due to rubbing through if left there.
