Buses  came with plastic escutcheons in the front, and chrome ones for the 
cargo  doors.

Cargo door... panel... spring (light) ... chrome  ring..handle
Front doors... spring or foam square...panel...  ring...handle

I think the ones with screws for the front door inner  handle had foam 
squares 
with hole cut for the handle to go  through,

the pin handles had pretty hurky springs.
