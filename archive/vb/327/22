what else did you have to modify?
did you fab a new hoover bit for the bigger cooler?

Hi Andy,
The strip is the same as the differance between the doghouse cooler and the 
type 4 cooler.  In otherword lay them side by side and measure the differance!
We modify the exhaust shell to taper down from the now expanded type 4 
doghouse shroud.  Yes, the Hoover bit has to be lengthened and we add material to 
prevent it from cracking as happens even on a stock one of these parts.
You can see some views of the shroud modification and our reangled gas tank 
neck to work with the 1968-71 bus gas tank in our 1960 walk thru panel camper
