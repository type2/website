Subject: Interior handles

I am currently fitting door cards to my bus and it previously hasn't had any
collars around any of the handles.

I see on the parts list it talks about springs - does anyone have any pictures
of the springs that go on the cargo doors and describe to me how the handle,
spring, collar and door card are fitted?

Should there springs on the front door cards too?  What should these be like?

Also does anyone know if you can get repros of the collars that go with the
66-67 flipper front handles?  Haven't had any luck finding chrome ones, and
only found one plastic one?

Thanks
Paul
