Dave, if don't already have the plywood, call around to some local
wood shops. Someone most likely has baltic birch. This is the stuff
that you read about in the library and such. It's fantastic stuff.
large 5x5 sheets and the stuff bends like you wouldn't believe. My
local lumber business actually stocks it. (although they call it
russian birch). Go ahead and find it since the workability is much
better.
