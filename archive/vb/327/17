Just my opinion on cooling...

The front of the bus pushes air away from the sides of the bus at any speed 
above 35-40 mph. I suppose the air tube trick would show low pressure all along 
the sides*. The pushed away air, high pressure, eventually returns to where it 
was pushed from. I wouldn't be suprised if the high pressure air returned to the 
side of the bus right at the engine intakes at nearly 90 degrees to the body. 
The bus was engineered and engineers know this stuff. Running at the top 
designed speed is also the top designed load on the engine, so I'd think the 
cooling system is optimized for that 
condition. Larger engine, faster speeds throw off all the conditions.

*The air tube pressure 'guage' shows the difference between the engine 
compartment and the passenger compartment. It'll be affected by open windows, 
vents, sunroofs and the heater.
