Hi Bart,
An oil cooler cools the engine oil.
  A transmission cooler is for automatic trannies to cool the ATF(automatic 
tranny fluid) which is pumped under pressure in the automatic tranny.  
Automatic trannies and even the VW auto-stick tranny of the bug and KGs all have a 
torque converters.  A torque converter is a camber with two fan like devices 
inside called impellers just slightly seperated in the torque converter.  One of 
these impellers is directly connected to the crankshaft and the other to the 
tranny inputshaft.  The engine impeller stirs the ATF and this stirred ATF in 
turn spins the tranny impeller.  With this fluid drive when the tranny shifts 
gear your head is not snapped back and/or engine knocked out by the sudden 
change in accelleration/deccelleration load changes on the engine.  Because the ATF 
is stirred like this it creates alot of friction in the fluid and thusly heat 
to be shed.  This is also the reason automatic trannies cause more loss of 
HP, torque, and MPG than the same automobile with manual tranny!
