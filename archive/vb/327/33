  Come on people, use the archieves in vintagebus or type 2. This subject has been covered as much of or more then 
the tire thread.  
  I know the list has been slow, but every post cost money and this subject HAS BEEN COVERED numerous times.
  Lets use the band width on trip reports or a new subject.
