Subject: Help- I played mechanic

Hi Volks- I have a type1 1776 that has run wonderfully all season. Went
out today and changed carbs (all nuts and bolts accounted for) and
ignition wires. Went to start the bus and heard a horrible knocking
sound from the engine. OK hooked up two wires wrong... Checked and found
the wrong wires. Started it up and the same heavy clunking sound
persisted.  Immediately turned it off and then tried to turn the engine
by hand. I heard a clunk at 10degrees BTC and the engine seemed to go no
further. Turned the engine back the other way and got the same " thunk"
and the engine would turn no further at 10 degrees ATC. I am at a loss
and have no idea of what could be wrong or how to fix it and I want to
go to Natural Bus.... HELP- please!!! TBear

Don't take life too seriously-you'll never live through it.....
