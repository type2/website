Subject: RE: [VB] engine question

It almost sounds like you have starved a lifter. Have you tried running a 
thicker oil to see if the noise is subdued? It seems like it may be an 
oiling problem- as the oil gets hot and more thin it isn't adequately 
bonding to your engine parts. I'm by no means an expert- but I would check 
your oil pump as well. If it wasnt replaced when you did the top end work it 
may be in need or replacement or repair. Hope this helps
