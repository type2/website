Subject: Re: [VB] Piston Pin Bushing

  It would be easier to just replace the rods with a rebuilt set. Put the pin off the new P/L set nd see how they fit. If 
they fit nice wirh no up and down movement you might not need to replace the bushings. Try DPR machine in Santa 
Ana cali for a set of rebuilt rods, I have used them for years, great quality
