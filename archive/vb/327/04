Subject: Re: Karl's 66 Deluxe - Ouch!

 I had the same thing happen to me in February.  I was in a parking lot
travelling about 20 kms/hr maybe when this car ran a stop sign.  I could not
have avoided the accident as there was snow piled pretty high on both sides
of the road.  It was the single time I had my bus out all winter.  The
damage to my mint 78 was devastating to me - I was crushed.  Anyway - the
insurance company was pretty good about it after threatening them with a
nasty letter on a lawyer's letterhead. They used the word 'write off' that
... got me excited.  Anyway - all is repaired with a new nose section from
Brazil via Denmark, and a new bumper and lights etc... I am truly amazed at
how well they matched the paint to the original sage green.  The damage
wasn't as bad as Karl's but it was pretty bad - I'd hate to see a bus cut up
but I'm sure Karl knows what he is doing.  I have pics if anyone cares.
