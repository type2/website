Subject: RE: [VB] highway speeds

I was reading and hoping you were going to say gear change, and you finally
did! I spent a grueling couple of weeks doing 95 miles a day on the highway
and could only achieve an average of 65 according to my wife who was pacing me
one day. Since I haven't installed my new speedo yet I was unsure until she
drove with me one day.

As fast as I can! 8^)

Cool weather - 75 mph max. cruise at about 70.
Hot weather - 65 mph max.
Passing - 80 or all it's got.

This is with a freeway flier tranny and a CW crank in the engine.
