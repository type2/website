Are there some sort of supports you'll add when it
goes into the workshop or is it a whole lot safer if
it's bolted into the concrete?
I know I'd take a step back and a very long think
before I decided to put my bus up on that, let alone
get underneath it the way it is at the moment.
Granted, $2500 or there abouts is a whole lot cheaper
than you'd pay for a 2 post heavy duty hoist.
:o)
