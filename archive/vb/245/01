i used an online rpm/mph calculator and then printed graphs of the 
results... one on white paper taped to the dash showing a straight 
rpm to mph line for each gear, with a big circle at 69 mph/4000 rpm 
or so. the other is on clear plastic, and sits on the tach face; has 
colored arcs showing the mph per rpm in each gear. looks great at 
night, but hard to see in day.

i'm not sure how accurate it is, as in this area i've never been on a 
tenmile stretch of highway where i could keep a constant speed to 
time it!
