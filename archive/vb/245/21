Subject: power converter sources.

I've started looking into adding power converters to my 2 busses. From
what I've found the power converters that come in RV's & travel
trailers seem like they would fit the bill very nicely (i.e. battery
condition gauge, relays, panel access mounted). I've found some here
and there on that unmentionable auction site. Which brings me to my
question. Anyone have any good sources for where old rv or travel
trailers go? or what happens to ones that are wrecked. A pick-n-pull
that caters to these would be great, I just have none in my area (Mid
TN). Any tips or pointers greatly appreciated.
