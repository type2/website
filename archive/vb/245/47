Harbor Freight has a big two post lift in their catalog for $2100. One
cool thing about those, is that they usually have huge pins that go in
once the hydraulics have done the main lifting job. Once the bus is in
the air, you just have really large steel holding it there. That is what
I want to put in my garage (after our family get's done living in it). I
have a friend who has a large shop and has a four post lift that you can
actually roll around. You can lift a car up and then put the wheels down
and push it off to the side. Of course, this is a huge apparatus and
takes an even huger shop to be able to move it in.
