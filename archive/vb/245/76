Subject: Re: [VB] Hippies- One last clarification, it wasn't them!!

why would you "blame" a group or individual for modifications they make 
to the most modified vehicles ever
ok you must be the customizing police.. do you cover other things like 
boat and houses?
perhaps you could tell us what modifications meet with your specs-now 
and in the past
