I see Frank is finally catching up on his mail.

As an NBC employee on the Burbank lot, I'll let ya know if he drives one
to work. There is someone who drives a 67 deluxe hard top, but he's out
in the lot and not inside on the midway. Every day is a different one
out of the stable.  Friday it was an impeccable Chrysler Imperial 300
(white hard top).  A few days before that it was a full size vintage
fire truck.
