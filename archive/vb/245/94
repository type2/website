---------------------- Clip----------------------
Summer months run 20/50w  or 15/50w synthetics.
Its just a fact that most Air Cooled VW engines overheat and thin the oil
so the 20/50 cost the same ......... run it.
If you're in deep freeze territory you might still want to run 10/30 or
10/40w in the harder winter months.
Lots of discussions on this matter in the archives ........... too much
for any quickie read.
