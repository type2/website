And I am wanting to do the exact same thing!! but here in Nebraska so if
anyone in NE/IA/MO/KS/SD/CO/WY/UT/ID/MT/Canada? has one and is coming
through here before late July bring it please!  Also I don't have a big
Nutter tranny and want one of those too!  After Late July I will be in
NE/IA/MO/KS/SD/CO/WY/UT/ID/MT/Canada? and can pick it up there!  I know that
there are a few of us Midwestern Bussers that want to go toward Glacier
National park before the Colorado shows on August 9th and 10th and than hit
those shows on the way home like we did last year!  and the year before!  If
any one is interested in meeting up with us somewhere on the road (last week
of July and first in Aug) please let me know and We'll try
Ellis??
