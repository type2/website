RV power converters are nice.  They're also usually supported by a rather
massive set of batteries.  You can run one from the engine-start battery
in a Bus, but you won't get a lot of juice out of it before the battery
is so dead it won't start the engine.

A stock 12 V Bus battery is something like a group 42, which has a
reserve capacity of about 75 minutes for a 25-amp draw.  You can use
a bigger battery like a group 24, which has a 90 to 120 minute reserve
capacity, depending on model.  With a 100% efficient inverter, 25 amps
on the 12 V side gets you about 2.5 amps (about 300 W) on the 120 V side.
In reality, you'll get about 80% of that, or 2 amps / 250 W.  So, you
can run 250 W of stuff for two hours, tops, before the inverter will
cut out due to low battery voltage.  Then, your battery will be at
about 10.5 V and you'll have to figure out some way to charge it before
you start the engine.  Yes, this does scale, but it's not linear - you
get 250 W for two hours, 500 W for maybe 45 minutes, 1000 W for maybe
15-20 minutes, etc.  Going the other way is better - you might get 125 W
for 4.5 hours, 60 W for 9 hours, etc.

Running the inverter from a group 24 deep-cycle battery buys you maybe
20 minutes more run time.  Using a bigger deep-cycle battery is better;
you can get 3 hours out of a group 27 (13"x7"x10", 55 lbs) or 6+ hours
out of a group 4D (21"x8"x10", 119 lbs).  Installing a separate
deep-cycle battery also means that you can still start the Bus with
the engine-start battery, even if you've run the deep-cycle all the
way down with the inverter.  But to get the deep-cycle battery charged
back up in a reasonable time, you'll probably need the biggest
alternator you can lash onto the engine.  (A stock ~40 A 12 V alternator
would take about 5 hours to do nothing but charge up a dead group 4D
deep-cycle battery.  No juice left over for driving, etc.)

There's a lot more detail on this in an article in the Library:
http://www.type2.com/library/electrip/battbas.htm

For light-duty use, like running a laptop, a small TV, etc for an
hour or so, those $40 inverters from Wally World are hard to beat.

I've seen some lightly wrecked ones at places that sell new RVs, but
I got the impression these were going to be fixed instead of scrapped.
Punching "rv salvage" into Google gives several likely hits.  One is
in Arizona, one is in Indiana, and one is in southwest Missouri.
