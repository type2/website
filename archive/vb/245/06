Interesting.  Once you have it at the height you want, is there a pin or
some other kind of mechanical stop to lock the lift, or are you just
depending on the valve(s) in the hydraulic system?

Even with mechanical locks, I don't know if I would use that lift outside
on a windy day...  On the other hand, I'm spoiled by reasonably good
access to a two-post lift inside a garage.  :)
