Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Full-Flow System Oil Pressure

ok this is easy, you already told us what was wrong!!!!
oil goes in to the remote lines and only a little (Low pressure) comes out

A quick (and dangerous way) is to mount the pressure sender at the "end" 
of the remote lines.
start engine and see what you get. Obviously you cant run engine more 
then 10 seconds
OR if you have a way to pressureize the lines-grease gun-compressor be 
creative.
use compressed air through just as a sort of qualitative test. switch 
filters

I agree with the technical guys I am an engineer too- I worked for over 
10 years as a mechanic for a few on air cooled vw's
Sounds like a simple problem.  The hoses could be too small but not too big.

one time i used a pump/filter one piece unit and it had adequate 
pressure at hwy speed but at idle the light flickered- I gave it away 
and changed to a gene berg cover and full flow filter. taped the oil 
gallery and ran an HP-1 filter worked great
