That almost brought a tear to the eye-- wonderful story, Cal! Being the ripe 
old age of 23 (almost 24) myself, I can definitely appreciate the history one 
has with a vechicle. :-)  I hope to hang on to my 67' as long as possible, 
hoping that it too will reveal a few more "secrets of life" along the way. 
:::sigh::: If I could only keep a VW that long.....  

Amiable Regards,
