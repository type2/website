Subject: RE: [VB] 21 window shirt

My point was that if I was driving and I saw a shirt with a Bus on it I might lean in to look at it! Geez, first i'm a "hippy hater" and now I'm a "cyclist-side-swiper". Maybe I should change my signature to a disclaimer!
Interesting about the L.A.W though, I guess it makes sense they would want better roads as they were riding on solid rubber or canvas tires! Was/is there a program in which bicyclists help taxpayers/auto drivers pay for the upkeep of roads? (Kind of like sportsman paying for most of natural habitat restoration programs.)
