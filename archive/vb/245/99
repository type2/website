Subject: RE: Oil opinions

Someone had has said that I should put my reasons for asking the question
about the oil.

Basically a local store has Havoline 20/50 at 25 cents a quart.
I'm thinking about buying what's left..  (about 20-30 quarts)...

is it a 'buy it now' situation?

I'm sure that this has been covered at some point but I just need opinions
about using various oil grades
What do people think about using 10-30 or 20-50 oil?
any pros, cons, don'ts, do s?
