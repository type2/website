 Sure it can be wildly off.
 Think about it!
 It's the first thing that goes wrong. >>

hmm..... I don't think so.  I had to fix loads of things on this bus ( It had 
been sitting for years when I got it) but never messed with the speedo, so 
lots of other things went wrong first.  like the tranny, the engine, the door 
mechanisms, the brake hoses..., the wiper motor, headlight bulbs, tires, window 
seals, the axle boots, ......

To be more clear, the speed the speedo says seems reasonable.  When I feel 
I'm going 40, the speedo does not say 25, nor 55.   It may be a few MPH off, but 
not a huge amount.  If people tend to drive slightly above the speedo limit, 
then my speedo is about accurate.   Driving 70-75 I am passing people (no that 
is not my regular speed of travel, but I'm doing that scoop/ cooling test, 
and I want lots of data points in each gear to plot a curve), and it would seem 
that people drive 65ish, maybe 70 on I-5 between Oly and Centralia.   (Ya, I 
know, they drive faster in California. they also seem to think driving is a 
video game, and don't know how to use the cute little blinky things on the sides 
of their cars)

 I had driven a bus where the speedo said 70 when i felt I was going 55-60, 
and it did seem really skewed.  that was a 70 bus.   Maybe th speedos got 
tetchier the later the techology, if your 83 went through 5 of them.

then again, anyone who has a GPS and wants to calibrate is welcome to
