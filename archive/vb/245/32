Ok, Its friday, I am new to the list so.. please keep me at bay if I am annoying
but..  I am wondering what speed people like to drive buses on the 
interstates.

me: 64 standard with 1600 sp, 009, pict30/31, empi single pack ( yes I know stock is better ) 
average speed  60 mph -> my top speed 75 mph 
-I have the later 64' trans
with redux boxes... If there's no breeze and bumps I don't mind 65  ....

I love to know what people's driving styles are like...

Memorial Day:
Just do what Stan does, slow down, stop at the cemetaries its _not_ a 
passtime for old sentimental people but a real connection to human sacrifice. 
Freedom is not something cerebral, its a REAL feeling... 

all you driving to shows be careful..
