Pressure relief valve.  The thicker the oil, the more will end up being
dumped out the pressure relief valve than through the bearings.

Lubrication in the engine is based on flow, not pressure. The more oil you
can get to your bearings, the better. By providing more oil, more heat can
be removed from the bearings and related surfaces and also keep a constant
'hydro-planeing' effect (Remember, a 3500 lb car can hydroplane on water,
with a tread/asphalt contact surface. The more water you have, the better it
will hydroplane. Same thing with oil). If you have a very thick oil being
provided to the bearings slowly, the oil will cook at the bearing surface.
Since a stock doghouse cooler is regulated by oil thickness, you will pass
more oil through the cooler with a thin oil than with a thick oil.

All in all, do you want more oil to be pumped into the sump, or to the
bearings? 5w30 oil since new on my motor. Over 40 long distance drives (500
miles or more), half of those being with the bus fully loaded with as much
as I could fit in it. I can slow my idle down to 5-600 rpm, and the oil
light still does not come on when my oil temps are 210.
