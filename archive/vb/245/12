Dear List...
I am looking for a pair of Hella taillights for a 1960 travel trailer
from Norway. They are oval in shape, half red/half amber lenses and
protrude out the back of the trailer like a couple of knobs rather than
flush (if you get my drift). They're about the shape and size of a huge
goose egg.  I have run out of ideas on where to find these... they were
smashed in transit on the high seas..
Bus content: I'll be pulling it with my '67 deluxe after I find a
European tow hitch (anyone?)
Thanks,
Susan
