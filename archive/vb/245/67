Most of the M-code lists around crap out around 300 and pick up again
in the 500s.  The consensus seems to be that many of the 300 and 400
series M-codes mean required equipment for a particular country.  For
example, 303 is Italy, 396 is England, 430 is US (including dual circuit
brakes).  My '64 (built November '63) has M 426 which doesn't show up in
any of the lists I have found.  Roughly, earlier Buses tend to have
separate M codes for each piece of different equipment and later Buses
tend to have a 300 or 400 series M-code according to original destination
country.

You can research M-codes a bit at the VintageBus Registry:
http://vintagebus.com/registry/  Put the M-code number in one of the
"search" boxes and hit the "list format" button for all the details,
or hit the "stats format" button to get some summary tables of all
the Buses in the Registry that have that code.

My Bus came with MX-140 (aka MX-265) * so I can't say for sure.  Doliwa
says:

12 Dec 1963  1 178 188  Seats and seat-backs:  Front seat bank support
                        rod changed.  Seat and backrest (purchases
                        seamed/lined with pleats.)  Upholstery welded
                        together; was sewn.

The second sentence in German is: "Sitz- und Rueckenlehnenbezuege mit
Biesen gesaeumt."  At any rate, it appears that the seat upholstery
changed in December, so your Bus might have the "62-63 style" seat.
