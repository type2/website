http://www.hfn.ca/driver.htm is a fairly good overview with references
on how people perceive speed and what speeds they drive at.  A speedometer
shop should be able to calibrate your speedo, but make sure you tell
them you are doing it out of scientific curiosity, not to beat a traffic
ticket - they make their money by charging for affadavits that say that
every speedometer that comes into the shop reads 10% low.

Somewhat related, I finally worked out the derivation of the "distance-
speedometer ratio" - the "W number" on the speedo.  The Bentley talks
about the different ratios for 15" and 14" tires.  It also gives the
specs on the tires

Tire       Diameter  Radius +/- 3 mm  Speedometer ratio
           +/- 6 mm  Static  Dynamic  km/hr  mi/hr
6.40 x 15  690 mm    321 mm  328 mm   0.48   0.77
7.00 x 14  666 mm    307 mm  313 mm   0.496  0.8

The extreme radii of 318 mm and 348 mm for a 15" tire correspond to
circumferences of 1.9981 m and 2.1865 m respectively.  Taking the
reciprocal yields 0.50049 and 0.45734, which compares OK with 0.48.
For 14" tires, the circumferences are 1.9101 m and 2.1112 m, which
gives 0.52354 and 0.47368, which compares OK with 0.496.  The mph
ratios are just the kph ratios multiplied by 1.6093 km/mile.

You can also tell the rpm/indicated speed ratio.  The 15" tires will
make about 480 revolutions in 1 km.  Doing this in an hour yields
480 rph or 8 rpm.  The 14" tires make about 496 revolutions in 1 km,
which is 8.26 rpm.  At 100 km/hr, the speedometer cable will be
turning at 800 rpm (15") or 826 rpm (14").  For the mi/hr speedos,
the numbers are 12.8 rpm/mph (15") and 13.3 rpm/mph (14").  At
80 mi/hr, the speedo cable will be turning at 1030 rpm (15") or
1070 rpm (14").

If you have something turning at a known speed between 0 and ~1100
rpm, you might be able to use that to make sure the speedo itself
meets the spec.  I wonder if you could fit a left front wheel hub
cover (with speedo cable hole) over the crankshaft pulley bolt and
use an engine tach.
