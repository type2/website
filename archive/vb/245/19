Subject: Sacramento here we come!!!

Hi Volks,
We are about an hour away from hitting the road going from Olympia Wa down 
I-5 South and planning to get to Sacramento in the early afternoon.  If anyone 
else is going to Sacramento VW meet and wants to caravan down with us or 
perhaps would like us to stop in (No promises, limited time for this trip!), look us 
up on the AIRS Washington State list and leave a message on our home phone.  
We check it every few hours on our trips and we will be out of touch computer 
wise.  Will be doing about 60MPH cruising speed!  Hope to see you there, look 
for our 1960 walk thru panel with "40 HP at work!  Please just pass!!" on the 
back.  Eric at the swap area wears an old cloth back pack and if hot and sunny 
an umbrella for some shade.  We are both a bit shy of meeting strangers and 
bad at remembering names so you will have to remind us of who you are.
See ya!
Eric&Barb
