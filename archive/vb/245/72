I call those things "Heim joints".  You can get them in various
configurations: the ball can have a stud (like that one) or a hole,
the socket can have female threads (like that one) or male threads,
they can be bright plated, stainless, or aluminum, etc.

To me that sounds like a set of 4 locking nuts, but I don't know for
sure.

>Can something like that be found at a hardware store?

Probably only a really good hardware store would have them.  A race
car, off-road, or airplane shop might be another place to look - they
get used a lot on all kinds of mechanical linkages, not just carbs.
Metric threads will probably be harder to find locally.

Once you find one, maybe try a little Loctite this time.  :)  Don't
get any on the ball or in the socket, though.
