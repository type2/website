<< Hey, came up with a question before I undertook the change of my 
speedometer.
 The good working one I got from Bob Petzel is a '62 vintage and my SC is a 
67.
 I am running PR195-14 tires and I have no idea what size tires and diameter
 the 62's were. Am I going to have a disparity in my speed reading by using a
 62 speedo in a 67 ?

maybe.   the 62 tires were bigger.  but it might not be too bad.   you maybe 
borrow a gps and "calibrate" it.   I mean, know how far off it is.

I have no clue how accurate my speedo is.  It can't be wildly off.
