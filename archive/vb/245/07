Subject: Its Friday here in Texas

I've sold my 83 Westy, having a good time with the remaining 66 Westy and
I'm thinking about buying a 75 model 912e Porsche with the Type IV
engine.
The Porsche owner claims 58,000 miles but he's an Airline Pilot and I
trust them about like attorneys, bankers, stock brokers and vinyl siding
salesman.
The price doesn't matter much in this transaction since you already know
that I'm going to get it cheap or not buy it.
I'm open to private and public comments about this particular model of
Porsche.
My nephew had a 78, 911 Porsche and he always had it in the shop. Loved
the car, hated the expense.
I've got some minuscule experience with Type IV engines so I feel better
about buying the Type IV engine in this Porsche. Then that means nothing
since I've got a Ceramic Enhanced 2090 cc Type IV engine I'm going to
plug into the Porsche, (Shades of Frank Gaunther here).

Is it legal to change the subject?
I got Poppy,the 7 month old puppy, spayed. (Breed: North American Mixed
Migraine.)
It changed her personality ,,,,,,,,, for the better.
She no longer complains about riding in the 66 Westy.
She's on a self imposed diet ,,,,,,,,,, only eats dog food enhanced with
table food (not scraps, nice cuts of beef).
She gets to visit her boyfriend, a sheep dog of sorts, that lives across
the alley.
Her other buddy next door, King, a French Bulldog ran away from home. (
Alias Houdini. He spent more time here than at home).
Guess he left with a broken heart when she started visiting across the
alley.
