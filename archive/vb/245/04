Subject: Re: [VB] speedo vs. tire size

i'm not sure how accurate it is, as in this area i've never been on a
tenmile stretch of highway where i could keep a constant speed to time
it!
----------------- Clip ----------------------
I'm a traitor!
I drive my Crown Victoria with a Law Enforcement Package when I want to
get somewhere 100/1000 miles from home.
I made a couple of 2000 and 4000 mile trips in my 83 Westy because I had
all the time in the world but I got to say; they were some of the worst
experiences in my life.
I loved the Westy for 125 mile lake and camping trips but for the long
runs give me a true 21 mpg per mile at 75 mph on those long runs.
Camping in a Westy is reasonable but it's just trashy sleeping in a Westy
on a Wal Mart or Truck Stop parking lot,  that's even avoiding the
discussion of dangers.
Come on down to Texas, we got lots of 200 mile stretches in a straight
line, absolutely flat. You can run 180 or 65 and keep a constant speed.
I've made two 800+ mile trips in this 66 Westy and it's like living in
the 50s, dirt necklace around your neck, wind blown and sunburned face,
just tired all over and that is after just the first 400 miles.
Don't get me wrong, I like my 66 Westy and its a real hoot to drive since
the only thing that is stock is the body shell. This thing is faster than
the last 356c Porsche I owned.
I've never blown a VW engine, I've never had a VW that stranded me, I've
never been anywhere in one (after getting on the lists) that I wasn't
paranoid expecting disaster of some sort.
I had a lot more fun, confidence, happy trips before I got onto the
various VW lists and became a "Paranoid Maintenance Syndrome" patient.
I had a 150,000 happy, stupid, carefree miles before I blew the rings off
a piston doing 85 miles an hour against a head wind. Then I discovered
the VW lists and started throwing money at these vans and realized I had
"Paranoid Maintenance Syndrome".
I got a couple of spare engines, a truck load of spare parts (sell some
once in a while).
In qualifying the statement 'I blew the rings off a piston', I put a
quart of oil in every 35 miles and drive 259 miles home on interstate
service roads at 30 mph. I guess that qualifies for blowing an engine.
