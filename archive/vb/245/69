Subject: MOKAN Show

Just to let everyone know that the Midwest has it's share of shows we 
have proof. You can see some of the pictures from the 2003 MOKAN show 
held this weekend in Lawrence Kansas. It was an all VW show but the 
busses nearly out numbered everyone else. At it's height we had about 65 
busses I believe. It was definitely the biggest Buskatier event so far. 
not bad considering how far we are spread across the country and in Canada.
In 2 weeks we will have the Omaha VW Club Show and Shine with a campout 
June 6-7th Check out the info at www.omahavwclub.com.
