Subject: m-codes/middle seats

Picked up an early 64 deluxe today with m-427. No listing for it on Vintage
Bus or The Samba. Also has m-195 which samba lists as Adjustable bench
seat/backrest (until 1963).
I was wondering if m-427 might be the walk through fronts with a full width
middle seat. anyone know?

Also wondering about the possibility of a aug. 63 built bus coming with a
62-63 style middle seat. still has 15's and pull handle front doors. any
early 64's out there with original middle seats?
