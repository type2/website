Tony's right about the possible dangers.  Your insurer might take a pretty
dim idea of it, too, especially if there were a fall accident.  The ones at
the oil change places have dedicated exhaust, stairwells (2), and drainage
(you can suffer a wet floor or worse, depending on your water table, if you
don't).

Sure would be nice for oil changes and valve adjustments, though, wouldn't
it?
