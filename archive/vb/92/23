Subject: Re: [VB] bad brakes

So I had a few minutes to spare today and so I checked my brake fluid and
topped it up and adjusted both front brakes.  The driver's side looked fine
when I looked in the little hole but the passenger side looked a little
greasy so I took the wheel off and everything looked fine.  I tested the
brakes out at a slow speed and they all worked very well - BUT - when I took
my bus out on the highway and applied the brakes it pulled dangerously to
the right again .... hmmmm.  I'm wondering if this could be some sort of
alignment problem and not a brake problem at all.  I did have tie rods
replaced and maybe they didn't do it right?  I normally try and figure out
how to fix my own bus but .... I needed a safety inspection for and didn't
have time to do the work ... damn.
