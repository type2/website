Subject: Built in Voltage regulator??

Hey All,
I think this 1600 engine I am working on for my 66 may have been converted to an alternator with a built in voltage regulator.  The alternator on it is Bosch Part number 9 120 080 122 then below that number it reads: K1->14v/51A
There are two wire connections on top of it, one is a screw terminal marked B+, the other is a male push-on connector marked D+
Can anyone confirm or deny that this is an alternator conversion, and if so, does it have the built in voltage regulator??


Peace, John Baker
