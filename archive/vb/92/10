Per Ronnie's post I checked the Kymco site and found this:
 
http://www.kymcovw.com/Media/pdfs/211953227b_inst.pdf

The directions mention "red" and "blue" relays; I think there were
originally red and blue stickers on each relay.  The red relay
is the one with the diodes on it in the doublerelay.jpg picture.

If all you have is what's in the doublerelay.jpg picture, then it
will only work on a Bug.  The third page of the Kymco instructions
mention the same extra diode that Ronnie mentioned to make it work
on a Bus.

The diodes make it work without lots of relays, but they also cause
a voltage drop of 0.6v to 1v or so.  That's good for a 15% to 25% or
so hit on your lamp brightness (per
http://www.kymcovw.com/Media/pdfs/relay_info.pdf ).
