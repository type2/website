VW TRANSPORTER AND MICROBUS Specification Guide 1950 - 1967 is published in
mid May. There is a US distributor
Motorbooks International. 175 East 5th Street, Suite 200, St Paul,
Minnesota, MN 55101 USA, tel [001] 651 287 5000, fax -5001
I think the list price is $29.95
It is NOTHING like the last edition..it is full colour with 400 pictures of
buses and bits of buses and includes buses in USA.
Lots of new info and updates...hardback and 96pp A4.
I have just approved the final colour proofs..boy does it look good.
How is the Camper mag going? Glad that something is being acted on from Jazz
HQ!!!!
