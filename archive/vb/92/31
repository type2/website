They are also extremely rare in northern Virginia.  I'm lucky if I see
another one (outside of the big VW show in Manassas) per year.  The last
I remember seeing was late summer of 2000.  I was driving the Beetle
convertible on an errand during my lunch break and came alongside a beat
up, working-class splitty doublecab, pearl white, driven by a couple of
grimy working class gentlemen.  We gave each other thumbs up and then
went our separate ways.
