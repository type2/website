Ok my starter starts when it wants to and my hand and screwdriver do the 
starting when it doesnt.  Why is it that when I turn the key the starter 
clicks, but when I crawl under the bus and cross the two wires it comes right 
to life???  The little things that keep me and my 59 closer than I want to be 
sometimes....
