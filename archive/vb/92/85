I'm sorry, I had assumed, but not understood, that the master cylinder
required was a dual circuit system. That's why I replied to the message. My
SC is a 67 with factory dual circuit. With the adapter kit, the holes on the
lines line up perfectly and the original resevoir plugs right in. Of course
you can use a Rabbit resevoir also, as both line up with the hole in the
floor.

But like I said, it's for a 67 van and SC/DC.

piston 71-79 style
master cylinder with an adapter kit and how about filling the two break
reservoirs now?
