I remember seeing a gadget at a Northern California VW show 5 or more years
ago. Vallejo or Pleasanton. It attached to the brake drums somehow and
tilted the car 90 degrees on curved steel rails. Powered by a 1/2" drill on
a screw drive!  Anybody else remember it? They had a big Mercedes on it.
Just did a bit of research (googling) and found the Easy Tilter,
http://www.accessiblesystems.com . Looks like a workable solution for
occasional underbody work. Tough to do oil changes though. Other good ideas
on that site too. If I had a welder and a pile of iron....
