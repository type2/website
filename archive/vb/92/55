Well,

I was hoping it wasn't seized but it looks like it is.  I don't have the
time or tools to tear it down, can anyone recommend a shop or individual
to
tear down and rebuild?  Its an all new 1904 that the PO bought had
installed
and never ran it.  I got it started and then it seized up.  I was hopig
it
was just high compression and a low battery, but after using a breaker
bar
to try to get it to turn...no luck, stuck.

Help,

Charles
