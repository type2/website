Subject: EMPI DYNO/empi Geru's

    I just got the engine dyno unloaded and was checking it out. It appears
to be from EMPI (vintage). The oil pressure gauge is a SPEEDWELL and the amp
gauge is EMPI. The tach is made by JONES and the HP gauge is made by
Helicoid.  The DYNO was mad eby STUSKA in Denver, Colorado and appears to
have been sold by EMPI being there is an OLD Empi sticker placed on the
front of the machine and the place I got it from had a lot of vintage EMPI
performance parts lying around. If I can get the original EMPI catalog from
the PO I will see if it is listed in there catalog.
    Any info anyone can give me on this would be helpful
