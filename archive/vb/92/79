Hi Thomas,
No.

  I am waiting to hear from another listee who has a rear tin with the 2 
small holes

No it does not make sense.  FI would not use an oil bath air cleaner with 
dual paper preheat tubes.

  Anyway can you tell me what years pulley tin will work on a 1600 with a 
rear tin > that will also fit?  I would like to use the semi circle pulley tin

1963 was the first year for the 1500cc accessory bus engine.  From 1964 to 67 
it was standard and all of these will fit 1600cc.  In the bug the 1300cc 
engine of 1966 was the first engine that had tin that will also fit 1600cc.
