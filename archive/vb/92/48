List,
       One small tid bit I can offer, you can spray both base coats like 
mentioned and then clear the entire bus, but, I prefer not to spray that much 
of an area all at once, you have a much larger chance if missing a spot, 
messing somthing up while taping, untaping, getting some dry spray etc. You 
almost definately will get over spray in some area's, which will lead to 
extra sanding and buffing. You also spend too much time in the booth, which 
will add trash to your booth, and trash to your paint job.  I NEVER spray an 
entire vehicle all at one.  I also never spray the doors or hoods etc on the 
car, it's simply too hard to get 100% coverage doing things that way.  if you 
want your door jambs to look like the rest of the car, or the bottoms of your 
doors to look like the rest of the car, paint it in small steps.  You don't 
want to be opening doors or deck lids etc while painting.  And tape lines 
suck, so try and avoid them.  Don't take on so much of the car at one time, 
and I will assure you the results will be way better.  Leave the complete's 
in one day to the collision shops.  Take your time on your pride and joys.

Good luck painting.
