Subject: 2-stage Two-tone?

I've only had experience spraying single-stage paint.

What's the method for spraying a 2-tone paint job with a 
basecoat/clearcoat system? You have to let one color dry before you 
can mask and paint the other color. What do you do on the 2-stage 
where you have to let one base color dry before you can spray the the 
other base color and finally the clear coat over the whole thing?

Thanks
