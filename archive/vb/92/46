I have built these pits and foxhole like holes in many locations threw out 
the years.  I have learned that the only way  to build this bad boy right is 
to have it poored in concrete.  The dangers of collapse are to serious to 
ignore.  We had one that stood for 6 months and then one day under the weight 
of a vehicle collapsed leaving the vehicle stuck.  The advantages go way 
beyond just minor work.  I would put some time and thought into this idea 
before breaking any ground.   The last one I had done I contacted a swimming 
pool company and explained I only wanted a pit no water and they didnt put me 
on a proirity list but they made it happen and it was wicked.  I also had 
laid out huge aluminum and steel pans under a 1 foot deep metal grade to 
collect all the oil and fluids I lost down in the pit and then used a pump to 
get them ready to ship to the local recycling center....just my two 
cents.....
