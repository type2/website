Subject: Re: [VB]  Tranny Oil Update spec update GL5 -MT1?

NO NO NO MT1 does NOT protect yellow stuff.
Not sure WHERE this MT1 mumbo jumbo snake oil started from but PLEASE go here
and READ the truth about MT1:

If this link does not work, here is the section of the page:

"API Category MT-1

Numerous performance specifications can be used to identify the level of
protection that will be provided by an automotive gear lubricant. In the past,
API Category GL-4 was commonly used to describe the type of lubricants that
would provide acceptable performance in manual transmissions and lightly
loaded final drive axles. API Category GL-5 described lubricants that were
generally used in final drive axles operating in moderate to severe service.
However, several new performance specifications are becoming the benchmark for
describing lubricant quality.

API Category MT-1, which was issued in 1995, describes the performance
requirements of lubricants intended for use in non-synchronized manual
transmissions, such as those found in heavy-duty trucks and buses. Lubricants
meeting the requirements of API Category MT-1 provide protection against the
combination of thermal degradation, component wear, and oil seal
deterioration, which is not provided by lubricants meeting only the
requirements of API GL-1 through GL-5."

PLEASE read the 2nd paragraph repeatedly until you understand the sentence
that says "API Category MT-1, which was issued in 1995, describes the
performance requirements of lubricants intended for use in non-synchronized
manual transmissions, such as those found in heavy-duty trucks and buses."

Your VW bus HAS synchros!!!!!  Find straight GL4 or Redline MT90.
