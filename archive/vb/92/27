All this discussion about bad brakes made me think
about the my experience which is that I've seen them
pull both ways, but I think the most important fact
about working on brakes hasn't been mentioned. 
Whenever any brake work is done on your bus, do
exactly the same thing on BOTH sides.  A friend here
in town replaced just one front brake hose, because he
thought it was blocked, and then the bus pulled badly
towards the replaced side because both hoses were bad.

Brakes are too critical a system to take any chances!
