Steve, List, Rex,
       I would get the entire panel to 600 grit, put the panel or panels in 
the booth, wipe down and seal the entire panel.  Seal everything, inside and 
out.  Be sure to use a sealer as close to the base colors as possible, I know 
this will be a compromise, almost everything covers well over white though.  
If you use the right color sealer, you can get away with two meadium coats of 
base and get good coverage, which will be a pretty thin mill thickness.   
Wait about 2 hours or so, let it get good and dry, you usually have 3 days 
depending on the product.,  then tape off one color, spray the other color, 
let it dry again 2 or 3 hours, you usually have about 12 hours here, again, 
depending on products. On the first color I would tape it so that you are 
actually painting into the second color just a tad, maybe a 1/4 inch or so.  
Then sand that tape line out with 400, then 600 grit, don't go through your 
sealer.  Now tape your second color up, tape it exactly where you want the 
line this time.  Be sure to tape everything you don't want the second color, 
spray this color, wait atleast 20 minutes, then untape everything, and clear 
all of it.  Don't sand your second color tape line, so that you keep a nice 
crisp edge between the colors.  Be sure to put enough clear on to bury the 
tape line and give yourself enough material that you can safely color sand 
out the ridge, if it is even there after all this!!  Also tack rag between 
ALL these coats, I would also wipe down..

Good luck painting.... Hope I helped some out.
