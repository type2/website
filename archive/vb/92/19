Subject: RE: [VB] bad brakes

I realize it's counter-intuitive, but whenever I've had this problem (and I
think others have confirmed this), the brakes pulled toward the contaminated
side. I just call 'em as I see 'em.

No....brakes 'pull' to the side that works.  If the friction material does
not
grab anything, it cannot slow it down. If the RIGHT side is contaminated, it
would pull left.
