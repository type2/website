Subject: Re: [VB] Tranny Oil Update spec update GL5 -MT1?

This sounds like the same stuff that you can get at the Audi/VW dealership.  
It is the only gearoil that is used in the Quattro all wheel drive systems.

The stuff that the dealer has is full synthetic and was approved by VW for 
use in all the vehicles they have ever produced.  It is made by Kendall or 
Mobil, I forgot.  But it is GL4 and GL5.  The downside is that it is 
expensive, $25US per US gallon.  The  parts guy gave me an extra gallon for 
free though. You will have to bring your own container because they get it 
by the barrel.

Good luck
