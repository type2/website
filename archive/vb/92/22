Subject: Re: [VB] Dear John letter...

People *should* be blowing off the MVVC show, or at the very least,
passing out informational literature so the unwitting dupes that
show up can realize they're being tooled.  Yes, tooled.  They're
letting themselves be prostitued by VWOA, in exchange for a place
to hold their show.  They're being *used* to pimp the new water-pumper
crap.   *They* think they're in some sort of symbiotic relationship.
They're not.  The 'benevolent' entity that's using them as a sales
tool is at the same time making it hard for those same people to get
parts.

Sure, its hard work putting on a show, which just makes it that much sadder.

The best thing for this club to do would be to *move* the show somewhere
else, and explicitly *UN-invite* VWOA.  Second best would be to pass
out flyers explaining what's going down, because the average VW guy
on the street is completely unaware.  John Henry has some excellent
material they could use.

initially alluded to in your post.  Basically, the only connection that VWo=
