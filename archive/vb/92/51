This is interesting but, you didn't answer his question. How do you paint a
2 tone car? Do you apply sealer, base and clear to one area 1st, wait for
all to dry, and then mask the painted area and paint the other color?

If so, how do you deal with the ridge of accmulated paint along the
transition line between the colors?
