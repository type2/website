Subject: Re: [VB] New weird toy bus & small nut tranny for sale

My daughter just brought one of those home last week...cool in a strange
way.  Kinda of a bus with a major top hack.  Still, it does have the split
fronts.  Wonder how long all the toy freeks will be hording them and then
trying to pawn them off at the next swap for 3 times the price.....?

Saw an ad in today's paper for this characature of a single cab.  I guess
orange is the New Black as fashion police would say.

Or just www.divastarz.com , Catalog and then Diva Cruiser. I'll wait 6
months or so to find one at the swap meet. 

Anybody need a small nut tranny out to the backing plates? Untested,
removed from a '60 junker a few years ago. I can deliver to BYOB. $85 will
cover my cost on it.
