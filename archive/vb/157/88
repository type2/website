Rob,
	I was lucky enough to see the Chaos Bar in action at Burning Man 
last week.   It was an amazing sight at night with flames blowing out of 
the two stacks on the roof.  Steve brought it by the VW Bus Camp for 
some repair towards the end of the festival.  It was stuck in first 
gear.  Steve said that the bus bar was extremely overloaded most of the 
time but never ran hot.  Emon and I tried to fix it but no luck.  We 
suggested that the drive shafts be removed for the tow home.  This bus 
was fun!  Gary Gibson
