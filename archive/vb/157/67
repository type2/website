Subject: My bus got hit by a lincoln

Hello Folks

I'm sorry to say that my bus was involved in an accident yesterday. A 2002 
lincoln
pushed the entire drivers  behind the door to the rear bumper in about 3 
inches.
He has state farm insurance and was cited for violating my right of way. I 
need to know how to proceed with the insurance so i get the real value for a 
vintage vehicle.
The bus was in the process of restoring and I'd hate to lose it for nothing. 
if anyone
has had experience with this I'd like some advice.

Thanks Much
Jim
