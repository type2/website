Subject: Rain Rain Rain

   This morning VW Howard came by and helped me tow my flip seat to the
shop, IT IS pouring rain. This might seem trivial to some but for us here in
Havasu it is like going to Heaven.
   It was cool though that the Safaris didn't leak, but that was at 35 MPH
for 1.3 miles, not a very good test.
   Now the work begins to get it ready for Jerome, things to do
1. Swap trans out
2. do front brakes and master
3. install the rest of the glass
4. reinstall the camper interior
5. Pull an engine out of the 15 window and put another one in
6. install gas tank
7. install engine
8 check and repair wiring, change all bulbs to 12 volt
9 go get a set of new tires
10. install COW CATCHER bumper VW Howard got on his 4000 plus mile road trip

Sounds like a days work!!!!

ps. On a side note VW Howard is all fired up again and is back in the swing.
On his road trip he picked up a 1960 left hand drive left hand door panel (I
am going to buy it from him to add to my 1960 collection) and he picked up a
really straight 1967 hardtop deluxe(that bus is for sale for 2500 dollars
obo). Pretty complete rust free bus, runs and drives,
