I'm expecting a hauler to pick up the double cab i recently sold. It's going to
upper NY.
The buyer and I  were  concerned about the documentation the driver may need,
while it's being trailered across  country. I'm sure with a copy of the title &
a bill of sale there will be no problem? 
Has any one had trouble doing it this way?

Ellis sez:
No worries brother man! The hauler will instruct you on how it's done.
Basically the seller of the vehicle and he both do a walk around the vehicle
noting every blemish that can be found and marking them on a silouhette of a
vehicle. Upon arrival you will do the same thing. Be sure to carefully inspect
the vehicle prior to accepting final delivery and signing your name to the
form. It is common to tip the driver. It's just good kharma and good business.
Your carrier should have insurance bond for his/her business. Beyond that- the
carrier is the source for answers.
Good luck,
