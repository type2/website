Subject: Eberspacher gas heater

Dear List...
A while back I mentioned that I had run across a stash of gas heaters.
The guy doesn't want to sell all of them and so I need more info from
you folks on exactly which one I need.  I have a '66 s/c that
evidentally had the gas heater located in the spare tire compartment
located in cab behind the 2/3-1/3 seats.  I know I need a BN4, but I
think there were variations of that heater....early and late models.
Will someone  who has an s/c with the heater installed in the cab please
help me out here.  Also, we converted this '66 to 12volts, and I need a
'67 only 12 v wiper motor.  Thanks all!
Susan
