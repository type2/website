quite a story. I was considering driving my newly acquired Bus from LHC in
Arizona to Chicago but after a short discussion with Ronnie decided against
it. I kind of regret it now, kind of. So far I've been waiting almost three
weeks and the Bus is still in LHC and shipping company doesn't even know
when they'll pick it up.... so much for a good price! But I guess it's just
all my fault..... I'm cheap and scared of driving a Bus cross country......

But I think that I'm better off waiting for it than stuck somewhere in the
middle of nowhere, waiting for someone to rescue me... you never know.
quite a story....
