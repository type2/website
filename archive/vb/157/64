You'll get better overall efficiency if you run the fridge on 12 V while
moving.  All the fridge is doing is burning up the power in an electric
heater, so there's no sense in losing some of the power in the 12 V -> 
120 V inverter beforehand.  I have a little 300 W inverter here and it's
fused at 35 A.  If you assume it will pull 30 A (-at-) 13.8 V at full load,
you're spending 414 watts to get 300 watts, or 72% efficiency.  If you
want to assume it will pull the full 35 A (-at-) 13.8 V at full load, you're
up to 483 watts or 62% efficiency.  Running a refrigerator on this
inverter continuously for an hour would waste at least 0.048 gallons
of gasoline, or just under a mile of traveling at 20 mpg.

Again, http://www.tinaja.com/glib/energfun.pdf is recommended.
