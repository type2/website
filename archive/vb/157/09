I'm expecting a hauler to pick up the double cab i recently sold.

It's going to upper NY.

The buyer and I  were  concerned about the documentation

the driver may need,

while it's being trailered across  country. I'm sure with a copy 

of the title & a bill of sale there will be no problem?

Has any one had trouble doing it this way?
