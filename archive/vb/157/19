First let me thank Matt Roberds for the blinker fix. I regrounded the
indicator light in the speedo and all is well. Also to answer a couple of
questions since the original post:
  I am running P205/75/15R Michelin light truck tires. Some folks run car
tires, but it's really a truck. I can cruise comfortably at 60 all day.
  The Mobil 1 20/50 V-TWIN bike oil seems to be a perfect lubricant for this
application. I use it in my Harleys and dropped engine temps about 15
degrees.
  Sound system is Custom Car Secret Audio setup with 300 watt amp, 6CD
changer and 17 speakers. Radio looks original and speakers are hidden except
for two boxes mounted in rear corners. Changer is behind driver seat.
  Interior is TMI two tone green vinyl.
Subtle added creature comforts include blower motor in heat tube, electric
windshield washer with resovoir behind passenger seat and small button on
left of steering column panel.  Flourescent engine compartment light is
tucked up and out of sight.
Two kinds of interior lighting. Regular white lights or neon green, all
hidden under seats etc. The green is cool. Just a soft green glow inside
that you can actually drive with it on. Two speed chrome fan is mounted
under dash for added air movement in hot weather. Cabin air filter installed
in air intakes to keep out dust. Furnace type filter media used for free
flow. It sounds crazy but the bus looks basically stock. From the outside
only the dual exhaust tips you off. A Gene Berg shifter is the only obvious
interior change aside from a wood snack tray behind the front bench seat
facing the passenger area.
Thanks again Matt.
