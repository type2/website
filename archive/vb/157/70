Damn, you guys are lucky!  Here in New Mexico it's a
month's wait for a VIN inspection from a State Police
officer or a $65 charge from the private guys!  I've
got an inspector who gives me a break since I'm his VW
"expert" (you have ordered your new Spec Guide from
NEATO, haven't you?) and then $100+ for a title,
including a sureity (sp?) bond.  Guess I'll have to
drag every bus out to Arizona to get Ronnie's AZ MVD
employee friends to help out.

PS Ask Jon (hazetguy(-at-)earthlink.net) how long it took
me to get a title w/o using my title company, doing
all the paperwork myself.
