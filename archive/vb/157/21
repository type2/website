Greetings Honorable Bus List Members:

Came back from a road trip and cleaned my 67 Bus. Like always, I covered the
distributor and coil with a trash bag before rinsing out the motor
compartment and undercarriage.

Went to start her and nothing. All lights work, just no cranking. Checked
the connections from/ to the Battery and starter, all looks right and tight.
Anyone ever have this happen after a good wash?

Hart H. Ponder, Jr.
