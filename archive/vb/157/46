Hi Eric,
The problems with doing that are:
1.  One has to drill a hole just beyond each end of the crack to relieve the 
stress. 
2.  Then grind out the cracked area from drilled hole to drilled hole for 
maximum weld penetration.
3.  Your welder must be very high powered to weld not only this thickness but 
the standard aluminum/magnesium alloy.  Just try welding to the case 
somewhere to see how well it does not work.
4.  If you do have enough power you can easily warp the entire case if you 
are not carefull!

If this case is so nice otherwise just tag it and store it till the time 
engine cases get real hard to find and welding technology just gets better!
