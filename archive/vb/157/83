Subject: The New Spec Guide

Just got my copy of the new Spec Guide.  It's a great
book, and Dave Eccles was nice enough to leave my name
in the preface because I gave a little help with the
first edition!

It's expanded greatly, and the best transporter
reference book available; m-codes, build dates by VIN
number, paint and trim "colours", month to month spec
changes, and lots of other info and pictures.  Sample
pages are available at Worldwide Splits.com: 
http://www.btinternet.com/~dace.ecc/

Since Ronnie's run out of them, unless you want to pay
the retail price, go to 
http://www.jersey.net/~neato/
or
http://www.neatoclub.org/store/spec_guide.html
to order a copy.  NEATO's special $23 price is only
good for a limited time, and only for NEATO members. 
You can join NEATO at
http://www.neato.addr.com/NEATO/join.htm
or email gbeng(-at-)world.std.com

Hope this is of help to everybody who wants a copy. 
Come take a look at my copy at the Turkis Westy with
the singlewheel trailer at Jerome.

See you at Jerome!
