Hi Tom,
Yes, there is a ID plate on the right side of the air vent, but this can be 
easily unscrewed and replaced.  Best to check for the stamped ID number in 
the body panel to the right of the engine and just forward of the rear apron. 
 Whilst this area could be cut out and a differant ID number welded in place, 
most likely traces of the welding will show up on the top or bottom of this 
area.
