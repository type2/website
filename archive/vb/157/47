Subject: Friday Question

I'm nearing completion on my '65 DC project and I'm contemplating auctioning it off for charity.

I've seen other people on the list do this for shows, etc. and I'd appreciate it if anyone that has
done this would give me some names of good charities that I might contact to discuss using their
name in the auction.

Also, is this best done at a show or have people been successful doing it in other venues?
