Subject: RE: Thank you and DMV education

I had the same problem when i brought the Binz up from Fla. I handed NC a
perfectly good legal Fla , title, then recieved a letter from them saying
theat the no. didn't exist and could not be the vin, i called them and the
lady said , slide thepaper between the windshield and the dash and make and
etching of the no. with a pencil. roflmao , uhh lady w're talking about a 58
VW the no. is not there its in the engine compartment. Well if you can't do
it then or field officer will have to verifly it. so i pulled the tag out
made 6 etchings around the dam paper. sent it back with a note if this isn't
good enough send your dam "Expert" out here. and let his nappy ass crawl up
in the engine compartment. Heheheh 2 wks later my title arrived. Took damn
near 3 months for my personalized  58BINZDC  tag to arrive... I love
clueless  DMV people. later
