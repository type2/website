If it's the one I am thinking of, it was features aggressively in the
2-hour season finale last year. Totally gorgeous 23 (21?) deluxe. No

Saw an ad tonight for That 70's show premier next week and there was a
really nice green and white 60's splittie used on the show, anyone know
who it belongs to? Couldnt miss it in the background. Brian
