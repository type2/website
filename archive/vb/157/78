Hi Justin,
Since you have done that much yourself so far you should be able to do the R&
R of the steering box.  Just remember to leave the pitman arms on each box or 
you have to carefully align the arm onto the new box so as to not have the 
steering lock up at inopportune times!  Also slathering grease on the area on 
the steering box and the body mounts to will keep down rust.
