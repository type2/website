Rick, westydrive,
We have a Coleman 40-Quart Thermoelectric Cooler With Power Supply 
(2-gal milk,  2-2L Diet Pepsi, and some food etc.) 1-1/2 years and 
working great many miles and hours 12v and 120ac. Our 45 watt solar 
panel is not quite enough to keep up. They say 40 deg f lower than 
ambient temp and it can do that .  Runs at about 4 amps on 12v.  For our 
power management we run it during the cooler hours and just save power 
when it it hot.  During cool days under 70 deg f we did get ice.
As westydrive said watch the current draw. We have seen several portable 
fridge that use less current - do not remember names but they were lots 
more money about $400 compared to $80.
Our solar panel came from Quartzite $250. (about 24in x 36in) sorry we 
are not near our equipment.

The Boler has a 2 or 3 way fridge and the Scamp has the old fashion ice 
box. We have been looking at the $70 to $130 small fridge from Home Depot.
westydrive,
We would like to see some of you test results from the other 
Thermoelectric Coolers.
P & C
