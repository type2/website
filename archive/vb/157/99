Subject: Re: [VB] Advice needed-Deck Height. Short block

I would take it all down and blueprint it before reusing any of it. I would also go back with a CW
crank, if it doesn't already have one. My $.02.

Basically, if I have to crack the block, or change pistons (if
deckheight is wrong) I am going direct to new longblock. Can't trust his
workmanship. A notion wish keeps pointing me towards dropping long green
and having a less stressful fall.
