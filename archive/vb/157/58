On my bus (67) the streeing box is very worn. It has been for awile, many
mechanics have told me so. What I want to know is how tough of a job is
this? I'm a novice mechanic. Have replaced an engine, redone my brake
system, rewired some things, ect,ect. So should I tackle this myself, or
take to a real mechanic?
