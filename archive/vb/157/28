Take the distributor cap off and wipe it clean and dry with a clean dry rag.  Leave the cap off and you turn the ignition key on (do not turn the starter).  Go back to the back of the bus and turn he engine over by hand, watching the points.  Near TDC you should see the spark jump.  You can also use a screwdriver to jump the point to look for spark.  There should be a spark, without it the bus does not run.  Turn the ignition off, wipe the points clean with a rag.   Make sure the wires are connected well.  Attach cap.  Try to start bus.  Get a Muir Idiot book- this sort of stuff is in it, and understandably written too.  Try the VW doies not start chapter, and also familiarise yourself with the tune up chapter.  

Ohm did you mean the starter doesn't turn the engine round at all?   In that case put the ebrake on, bus out of gear, and take a flashlight and screwdriver and jump the connection between the push on terminal on the starter where the wire is connected (it is still connected, ya?) and the bit where the battery is connected under the 13mm nut.  This should turn the starter over.   If your battery is fully charged and the connections are good, then your starter is rebelling, and sounds like it needs to be replaced.   I have never had a starter fail due to engine washing, but it could just be a coincidence.
