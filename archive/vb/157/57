I have had original safari seals where I did not cut them to fit around the
slider brackets. They wore thru the hollow tube at that point after a couple
of years use. I have got a new set of seals and now have made cut-outs
around the brackets. It appears to give a more even seal against the
original safari window frame so far and I am hoping it will not wear as
quickly as the other.
