Rick,

Read the ad copy word for word....

Looked at one yesterday the size of a 6 pack.

It *didn't* say it would cool it down, but only that it would "keep"
it cool.  Big difference to me!.

Usually they use peletier transducers...big battery draw.

Check the amperage required before buying.

Cheers, dave
