Subject: Running lean

Hello all

On my 67 bus I have a new 1641 engine built by Bugformance, installed by the
PO.   It has about 1500 miles on the engine now.  It had beeen running
great, but now it pops and misses at 1200 rpm or so, and it seems to lack
some of the smoothness it had at all ranges.   Compression is even and good.
We checked and rest the valves, they were fine though.  New points, plugs
and condencer, reset timimg.   On cylinders 1 &4 the  old plugs were VERY
light colored, indicating running lean.  Would this be my problem??  It has
dual Solex carbs, which I ahve never worked with.  I have fooled with SU
carbs alll my life, but they always eem to run rich, never lean.  Any guesse
as to my problem is and how to fix it??

Thanks!!

Bob
