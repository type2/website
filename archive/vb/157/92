Hi List,
At 'Shore up your Bus', we discussed the possibility of having an October 
camp-out in Harpers Ferry, WV.  It will be a beautiful time of the year for 
a camp-out with the foliage on the Blue Ridge changing. There is lots to do 
in the area, with the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers meeting at Harpers 
Ferry, there is a possibility of tubing or kayaking,  the Appalachian Trail 
and the C&O Canal appeal to hikers, and there's lot's of history in 
historic Harpers Ferry.  Here's a camp-out for the MD, VA, Metro Washington 
DC folk who do not want to travel to far from home.I was wondering what 
week-end in October would be the best for the locals.  Let me know!  You 
can drop me a line at airhead(-at-)acvw.com

Joy Thru Air,
