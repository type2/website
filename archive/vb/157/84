Subject: Re: [VB] Flywheel won't budge

Try tapping on the face all around the circumferance of the flywheel up near the ring gear with a
hammer. Sometimes they get a little rust between the flywheel and the crank. Tapping on it usually
breaks the bond.

I have a MAJOR oil leak and I am in the process of replacing the seal
behind the flywheel.  I got the gland nut off, but how and the world does
the flywheel come off?  Bentley says it will come off the dowels, but mine
ain't budging.  Are there any tricks that this kooky math teacher doesn't
know?  Thanks
