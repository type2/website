Subject: VIN Woes

When I was getting my plates here in CO for my 66 Samba which was purchased 
in CA with a HI title, I had a hell of a time getting even a temporary tag 
because 1) the VIN did not have enough digits, and the DMV computer would 
not accept it, 2) the previous title in HI said the bus was white and 
purple, and the DMV person thought the purple was really more of a dark 
blue, and that I was therefore trying to commit some sort of fraud.  These 
"discrepencies" kept me in a legal loop for about two months.

Furthermore, when I tried to insure the vehical to get the plates, the 
insurance company added zeros onto the end of the VIN so it would have 
enough digits for their computer to accept it.  When I took my insurance 
card to the DMV, they accused me of making up a VIN since no VIN could have 
that many zeros in a row.


ARRRGGGGGGGG!!!!
