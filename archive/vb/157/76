It is not very tricky
1) drive bus up on ramps
2) remove drag link from steering box bpitman arm (or pitman arm from steering box). 
3)unplug wire fromt horn- the one that goes through the steering box
4)gently remove horn button.  unscrew wire from horn button.  

5)undo nut (24mm?) that holds steering wheel on
6)tricky part- remove steering wheel.  It often does not want to come off.  I use heat if needed, soak with penetrating oil for a week before removal, unscrew nut to level with top of column and whack to break it loose, haven't tried a real pulley yet, that's an idea.
7) undo turn signal switch and collar around column that is bolted to dash.You do not need to unplug TS switch- just unbolt the two pieces so it is off the column.
8)
Break loose bolts under bus that hold column to bus. Do not do this on rickity jack or anything that is unsafe.  (If you don't have ramps, then leave the bus on the ground till these bolts are broken loose. I heard that driving one wheel one the curb works)  Undo them all and bring the column through the floor and pull it out from under the bus.  


Installation is the reverse of removal.  Grease where the wheel goes on to the column, and do NOT overtighten.
