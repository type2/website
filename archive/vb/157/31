The plate on the dash wasn't mandated in the US until about 1969.  I
think some makes had it before then but I don't think any VWs did.

There is a pretty good write up on VINs here:
http://www.nsxprime.com/FAQ/General/vin.htm  It's geared towards H*nda
vehicles but the format of the VIN is the same for any car sold in the
USA since 1981.  I used to think that there was no standard before
1981 but according to that site there was; it explains why Buses got
VINs like 215 xxx xxx starting in 1965.
