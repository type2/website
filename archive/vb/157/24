Subject: re:very clean, but will not crank over

check the wires to the coil....i have often knowcked one of these wires
loose...and i believe i came up with the same symptoms.

another option-i recently started running into problems with the "hot/hard
start realy" unit i installed in my bus. every know and then i get nothing
when i try to start the bus. if i crawl underneath and wiggle the wires in
the relay-it will start. i think the relay connections have become corroded.
so if you have one of these relays-perhaps you have gotten some water in it.
