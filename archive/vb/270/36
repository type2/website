If the engine is out, the 2 rear ones are pretty easy (although I
suspect the real problem is the front one). you put a jack under the
tranny, then unbolt two BHB (big honkin' bolts) that hook the mounting
bracket to the bus itself. then 4 nuts on each mount and they are out,
replace in opposite order. I'm not sure how easy the front mount is
with the tranny in. I am pretty sure it can be done, but be careful
and it will be a nuckle buster.
