That was kinda my feeling as well.  It has ran well up to this point (and is
still running well)   You know the old saying "don't fix it if it anit
broke"  I have already changed the oil.  I will add some rislone and change
again tonight

This washer is round, if you look at a cross section of it , the material is
square.

yesterday from the busdepot.  Oil pressure, temp an CHT.  I think that
