Subject: Re: [VB] oil change ?

The no drain plug really is not an issue to me other than the fact that I need
a place to put my oil temp sender.  Any other thoughts on where it should go
rather thatn the drain plug hole?

    To drain"  just remove 5 of the nuts, then loosen the last one and let it
drain, when done remove the cover," no biggy, just have to work a little more
for it.
