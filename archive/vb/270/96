 I wonder if your '71 had a pea shooter exhaust...like the ones on bugs. My 
 double cab had a pea shooter shoved in it when I got it. I changed it out 
 for a regular bus pipe when I installed the rear bumper. I actually don't 
 like the sound at all....liked it much better with the "bug" sound.

or maybe a header rather vs the stock exhaust.  

each motor does sound differnt though.   My old dog knew the sound of my old 
bus.   Other vws could drive by my mom's house and the dog ignored them, but 
when she heard Gus, she'd start jumping up and down and barking.   oh boy! oh 
boy!
