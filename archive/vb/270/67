The Solex carburetor manual at the doc project mentions this on page 7.

"The sizes indicated on [main, air correction, pilot, pump, economy,
and starter fuel] jets correspond approximately to their diameter in
1/100 mm, but these parts are not calibrated by their diameter, but
by their flow capacity.  These jets cannot be checked by calibre needles."

I don't know how well this applies to the jets you can get these days
(do they come from Solex or some aftermarket supplier?) but it at least
sounds plausible.  I wonder if it would be possible to do a home-brew
flow rate calculation by rigging a jet to a container and measuring
how long it takes a known amount of liquid to flow through it...?
