Hi Cal,
That jet with the little ball should be the pilot jet AKA the idle jet.  
Check a later bug or bus Bentley to make sure!  Now that you have changed the 
jetting of the carb you really need to adjust the carb properly for that jetting, 
check the type2 library for the proceedure for 34 PICT adjustment.  Big time 
you need to get a jetting gauge tool to make truely sure what sizes you are 
running.  We have found even NEW jets can be several sizes off........
  Additinally we do not trust sump oil temp senders due to thier location and 
any temp sender/gauge set should be tested with boiling water to insure 
accuracy at least for 100C or 212F down near sea level and a bit lower in temp the 
farther up in elevation.
