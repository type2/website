Subject: Lack of power - strange noise

Driving home tonight I thought I had run out of petrol as my bus lost power.
(gauge is wildly inaccurate)

Crawled to the petrol station and popped some in, the engine still runs really
badly.

There is a tinking noise coming from the right hand side of the engine, it
sounds like it is once per rev, though could be every other rev.  Noise is
kind of like a teaspoon being tinked against a cup, its not very loud at all.

Not popped anything off yet to take a look but has anyone got any ideas?

It is a stock 1600 dualport with a pair of twin 36 carbs fitted, I had tuned
it up (taking the filters off etc) earlier this evening as the carbs had gone
out of sync - driven about 40 miles (with a stop halfway for a couple of
hours.

Anyone got any ideas as to what it could be?

Thanks
Paul
