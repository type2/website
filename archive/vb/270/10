I agree. This appears to just be a case of an unscrupulous mechanic taking
advantage of someone. The fact that Dianne is a woman is merely coincidence.

I (a man) went to a tire shop to have 2 front tires replaced on my car and a
4 wheel alignment done. After a while, the shop foreman called me into the
shop. He showed me some alignment wear on _just one_ rear tire and said I
should go ahead and replace the rear tires as well. I asked him if the rear
tire was out of alignment, wouldn't the 4 wheel alignment correct the
problem. He said "no, these cars just have this problem and replacing the
tire is the only thing that would fix it:". I laughed and told him to just
replace the front tires.

If Dianne knew more about mechainical issues on VW's, she would be able to
deal with this better.

I think many of the people on this list have had similar experiences.   and
as the majority are guys, it's not (just) the woman thing, though I don't
deny
that could well be playing a part in it.
