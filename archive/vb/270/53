As hard as we have been trying, it looks like we won't be able to make it 
with this year's raffle bus.  We really wanted to bring it and show it off and 
hopefully find a few of the parts we still need, but it just doesn't look like 
it's going to happen.   We really don't mean to be anti-social and not come to 
these events, it is just a difficult time of year for us right before Jerome 
and all.  This is not to say that there won't be any ABC members in attendance, 
there are quite a few going that I am aware of.

Those of us stuck back here in sweltering Aridzona sweating over some lucky 
dog's new deluxe will be thinking of all of you folks taking it easy and 
enjoying the show in cool Sandy Eggo.  

Have a good show!
