Hi Clara,
Wolfsburg West lists it as L471 Stone Beige, at least for '61.

(http://204.95.114.10/colors/colorchrt.htm)

First time i hear of stone beige. The popouts on my bus are wierd 
grayish-beige (og paint) that matches the column and shifter and 
handbrake. maybe that's stone beige. seat frames are black, visors 
silver white, rest of interior is mango. rest of exterior above the 
beltline is seagull grey...

Andres (who found out about  a month ago that ALL the split bus parts 
that remained at the importer were bought sight unseen in June by a 
gent from Holland.... The parts guy at the counter, who was in his late 
seventies, told me it was 2 containers packed tight and included 
complete german crated engines from the 60's, transmissions, 
suspensions, nose clips, tail clips, seats, taillights, headlights, 
sunroofs, carburators, glass, headliners, bla, bla bla.)
So perhaps it will all show up on ebay one of these years? :-(
