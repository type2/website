Subject: Weird ebay Auction: Radiation sign from Russia

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=3623238989&category=10806

Is it just me or is it weird, if not potentially STUPID to actually want a sign
warning of RADIATION in Russian?

You might as well use a rabid badger as a love doll.
