Subject: Early doghouse? Trivia buffs read on!

Here is a very interesting find in the boneyard today!

First let me ask, was there ever a steel offset doghouse cooler before the 
AL cooler came along?

I am not really sure, but I did see a factory VW offset plate for a steel 
(normal pre-doghouse cooler) oil cooler that used 8mm oil holes (instead of 
the later 10mm).  The part number started with 040 which I thought was odd, 
cannot remember the rest nor do I carry writing utinsils to the junkyard.  
The oil cooler had been modified to be a little wider by adding side plates 
of steel and had the "Hoover bit" welded on which was interesting.  And the 
quality was top notch so no backyard creation either for the doubting 
Thomas's of the group.

I had half a mind to buy it, but I would never use it so I left it for the 
next guy.  I would have if it were 10mm oil lines though :)  The "H" case I 
have sitting around I just do not trust enough for a daily driver with the 
small oil holes.

Take Care,
Adrian Pillow
