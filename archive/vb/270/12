Subject: oil change - part two - should I worry?

Ok, did the oil change and got the screen out and proceeded to inspect stuff.
I had a fair amount of goop on the inside of the plate.  I would say at least
a 1/4 inch of it.  I poked through it, found some grit and stuff and a BIG
piece of a washer.  The small stuff did not worry me, but the washer did. This
is not your typical flat washer.  It is about the size of a dime and the stock
is square-ish.  Like a bushing or somethinglike that.  It was a little more
than a half of washer.  I could not find the other piece(s).  The engine has
been running great ( a little hot in my opinion, but not sure until I get the
gauges)  From the looks of it, the washer had been there a while (not sure
when the last OC was).  I am planning on changing the oil again tonight (dirty
again after running for 15min.)  Perhaps the pieces will show up.
