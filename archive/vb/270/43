Subject: 67 camper steering column color?

I plan on painting my steering column but wasn't sure about the color. The 
inside of the bus is off-white and the steering wheel is black. I'm thinking 
I should paint the column black but thought I'd check first. It is a 67 
kombi that I have started a camper conversion on. I have a 67 westy interior 
I have put in but I'm missing the ice box and the wooden bow things for the 
headliner. That can wait for next year.

I really appreciate all of you folks and the helpful advice you give.

Thanks,
Wayne Carlisle
