A lot of woodworking magazines contain 'patterns' of large projects and such, 
not all of which are full size.  They use a grid of, say "1 square equals 1 
inch" ad you have to buy a pad of really large graph paper that is used for 
presentations on an easel and 'enlarge' the pattern yourself.  This could be done 
in reverse: tape 3 or 4 sheets of this paper together, lay the panel on it 
and trace the outline.  With a good eye, a steady hand, and a good eraser, one 
could then 'reduce' this onto a regular 8 1/2 X 11 inch sheet of graph paper 
and scan it in.  A fair amount of work for whoever does it the first time 
around, but once done they can be printed out by someone across town or in 
Australia, on regular paper, grid and all, and the process reversed.  Obviously the 
finer the grid, the more accurate the tracing.

ANyway, it's just an idea on the subject.  If I had time and panels I might 
give it a shot, but I have neither at the moment.
