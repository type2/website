Well,

I run Autocad at work and have access to plotters that can print sheets up to 42.5" x 30".

If there was a resource that had OG schematics of the panels with or without dimensions, I would be willing to begin such a project.

I can produce files in the .dwg, .dwf, probably .pdf and I'm sure the compu-dorks out there can do better than me. 

Don't know where to find these original drawings, but I'm throwing my hat in the ring on the drafting/printing.
