Volks,

My son and I went across town on Wed. to have a look at a "'57" Oval
that was for sale.  It is in semi-restored condition, bad front clip and
non-curve matching front hood.  Strangely, [at lest to me] this "'57"
had semaphores.  What gives?  I thought they went the way of the
dinosaurs back in '55.

I did not get the vin number, so don't ask about that.  

Curt
