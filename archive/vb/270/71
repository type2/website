Subject: Re: [VB] Lack of power - strange noise

rev the engin eup and let go of the gas.  If you hear a noise like a 
rattlesnake when you let off the gas likely you have a bad rod bearing on the side the 
noise comes from.  DO NOT DRIVE the bus unless you want the rod to go through 
the case.  rebuild time.   

On the other hand, check/ adjust your valves, have a friend turn the engine 
round and watch to make sure valves move like they should.  Check that all 
spark plugs are good, none popped out, and the plug wires are still connected.  
Check to see if you are running on four cylinders by while the engine is 
running, pull one plug wire off the dist, reattach, repeat for other three.  All 
should make the engine drop the same amount, any that make little/no differnce is 
not firing properly.   If the wires/cap all are good, check compression.   
Does it make a noise when you turn it by hand?  did you drop something down the 
right side carb hole?  maybe?

 Crawled to the petrol station and popped some in, the engine still runs 
really
 badly.
 
 There is a tinking noise coming from the right hand side of the engine, it
 sounds like it is once per rev, though could be every other rev.  Noise is
 kind of like a teaspoon being tinked against a cup, its not very loud at all.
 
 Not popped anything off yet to take a look but has anyone got any ideas?
 
 It is a stock 1600 dualport with a pair of twin 36 carbs fitted, I had tuned
 it up (taking the filters off etc) earlier this evening as the carbs had gone
 out of sync - driven about 40 miles (with a stop halfway for a couple of
 hours.
