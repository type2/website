No, that wrong.  I paid him.
$1,000 for the 67 Bus ...

The rebuilt engine cost me my 71 bus in trade PLUS $600 cash.

The Band-Aid was after the fact.  The rebuilt engine started leaking
oil like crazy within one week of driving.   I had a 6 month warranty
on the rebuild.  He was supposed to replace the case.  He said he
did ... but I don't think so .. it is still leaking from the case.  Just not
as bad.

  First and foremost let me say that in no way am I
  defending the Mechanic.

  however If I understand correctly you paid $600 for a
  "rebuild" that ended up being just a band-aid.
