This is how I've felt about this story from the get go, but didn't want to say anything to that effect, cause it's a bummer.

Lesson learned, unfortunately. This is the reason we work on our own cars. I meet a new bus friend every few weeks around here (Central Cal, plenty of VW's) and see the same stupid automotive engineering mistakes everytime.

Even at my shop, which is an ACVW shop, I have to often call BS on my mechanic with my type4 bay. I have yet to take the split to him, but it'll happen eventually for something large and lift-related.

Best of luck, but consider saving yourself futher heartache & dollars in the future at the expense of your pride today. 

Sorry,

Billy
