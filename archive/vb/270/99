This might not be high precision, but here's how I would do it (not
having access to a large plotter):

1. use digital camera to photograph panel (include ruler for scale
reference)
2. tape kraft paper to wall
3. borrow video projector, and project photo of panel onto kraft paper
4. adjust zoom so that ruler image is 1:1 scale
5. use marker to trace edges of panel image

Of course, you could use a 35mm camera, slide file, and a slide
projector to do the same thing.  You'd want to make sure that the camera
and projector are perpendicular to the wall to minimize image distortion
(keystoning).
