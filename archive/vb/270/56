Subject: 6V started needed (-at-) familienfest!

If anyone going has a spare WORKING 6V starter they would like to sell,
please let me know and bring it to the show and I'll buy it from you.  I
have a ....uh, hum....T3 I have to get running "or else" if you married
folks get my drift. I'll be there Sat. morning in a L87 DC with a rack
and a Westy hitch.

Thanks!!

Steve
