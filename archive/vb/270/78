Hi Kevin,
Could be!!  Could also mean the column was replaced.  What color are your 
shifter and E-brake handle?  They should match each other and the steering stuff 
would have been the same.  Worse comes to worse check the VW bus parts manual 
for these parts and see what color is for which model bus!!!
