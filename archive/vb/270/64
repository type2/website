Subject: Re: [VB] 67 camper steering column color?

Call me whacky, call me crazy but I am under the impression that the interior
color should be, or typically is..., the color of the top half of the bus.
Make that cloud white, siber weiss (silver white) or whatever.

I would suggest that perhaps the black steering column was/is a refurbbed unit
or switched from another bus.

See the first paragraph once again about what to call me but I believe that the
Wesfalias, at least at one point in time, were more popular in North America
and harder to obtain visa vie supply and demand than the deluxe passanger
buses. Of course, we all know what is selling or demanded in recent markets.
