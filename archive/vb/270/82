Subject: The VW sound is not there

I don't know what it is about my 67 bus .. but it seems to be missing the
VERY FAMILIAR vw sound ....

With my 71 bus I used to enjoy a slow drive - windows open - around this big
lake  .. liked the sound of my engine etc.  But on this bus .. it is
different .. hard to say what is missing .. but something is.  It doesn't
sound BAD .. it just doesn't sound like a VW.
