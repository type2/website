Subject: Tranny and/or Motor Mounts

Replacing a tranny or motor mount .. how difficult can that be ?? I mean, if
you have someone to take out the motor .. and lets say it is the tranny .. For
beginners, how difficult a job is it to replace one.  I am 99.9% sure that is
my problem. [one of them.]
I used to relate the thunk noise to the clutch, but I find if I just let up
quickly on the gas I can replicate that thunk noise over and over ...  I don't
know why my mechanic didn't notice it .. possibly he never drove the bus any
further than 20 feet.  Probably never got it out of 1st gear.  I think I want
that to be my first project, I haven't gotten real far in the idiot book, but
it can't be a good thing banging around in there.  That might explain the oil
where the case meets the tranny, ya think ??
