euro market VWs had semaphores till ~1960.   Export to N America had blinky 
turn signals earlier.   There are many wierd combos not common here, as 
standard (ie cheaper) models were available elsewhere, in which things like 
semaphores and cable brakes and 6V and smaller motors were factory installed later than 
we are used to.
