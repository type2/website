Subject: Re: [VB] 67 camper steering column color?

Is this always the case. My bus has a white steering wheel and a black
column. Does this mean somebody put a white steering wheel on it?

Black steering wheel should mean black steering column.  The steering box
should have some color left on it due to being painted at the same time the
steering column was.
