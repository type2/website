Hi James,
Weatherwise here in Washington it depends on where you are!!  There are areas 
of this state that are hotter and colder or extremely dry and others where 
rain prevails to the extreme.  Here in Olympia area it is unusual to get below 
30F.  Rarely below 20F, and we so far in twelve years have only seen it get 
down to -6F once!
  You can check weather trends for locations on the web.
