Volks,

Weren't those decals part of a BMW ad in the Motor Trend type mags? 
That's where I got mine.  They are hot cars:  Dodge and Jeep SUV's,
Vipers and Ferarris.

I have a set under my front sliding driver-side window.  I figure with
an 1835, .044 heads, 100 degree cam, ported, polished and breathing with
a Holley progessive, I am entitled to them.

That said, I neither rev nor race her.  Dunno 'bout son Bry, . . . he's
busted an axle inside the tranny once already.  Trouble is, Bergmann
talked us into a 1700 pound Kennedy clutch set up.  Way overboard now
that I've driven it.  He said it would come in handy in the mountains. 
Huh?

Curt
