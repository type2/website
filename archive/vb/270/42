Subject: RE: [VB] Tranny and/or Motor Mounts

Replace the shift coupler and new safety wire if you remove so much that the
trans is out/pushed back, one of which condition will occur to change front
mount. If you remove trans completely, consider doing the badmittion
birdie-like shift rod bushings with lots of happy grease.  Cheap little
parts you can then forget about for many years.

If the engine is out, the 2 rear ones are pretty easy (although I suspect
the real problem is the front one). you put a jack under the tranny, then
unbolt two BHB (big honkin' bolts) that hook the mounting bracket to the bus
itself. then 4 nuts on each mount and they are out, replace in opposite
order. I'm not sure how easy the front mount is with the tranny in. I am
pretty sure it can be done, but be careful and it will be a nuckle buster.
