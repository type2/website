Subject: Re: [T2] Correct cam gear backlash (mechanics only)

I know what the Bently say's about the backlash, what
I have found over the years is that with the crank and
the new camshaft with bearings installed (well oiled),
in the case(not put together) turn the crankshaft, if
the camshaft does not raise out of the case it will
work. I just finshed a 2.0 L air cooled engine and had
to put a new cam in it, the old cam had a gear index
of -7, big time sweat with the new gears(no numbers on
the new one), but they worked fine,I always have other
crank gears if I find a miss match I change the crank
gear. Good luck with yours.
