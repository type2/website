Hi Tom,
It would be better to drill and tap a hole through the oil passage plug in 
the lower rear of the engine case that seals off the oil sump pickup tube 
passage.  Under the oil strainer is the lowest most cut off place of the engine case 
from the real oil temp and is cooled off not only due to heat rises in a 
liquid, but from air and especially water passing/splashing on the underside of 
the engine.  Plus that location will be prone to the wire being ripped off by 
grass/debris on the ground.
