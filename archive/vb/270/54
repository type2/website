Subject: red/white striped canvas tent $275

Hi.....this came with a camper years ago.....It is not a Westy or a 
Sundial.....

 Anyway it has Green canvas on the top and red /. white canvas material for 
the 3 sides,
 one side is left open and I assume goes up against the bus...... 
 its very heavy material and looks like its from the 50s-60s


 the top is flat........but......
 I put it up on my Westy Poles just to show you the size , it was made to sit 
flat and the Westy poles are peaked so thats why it
 does not sit properly

 there are no poles, but I went out and bought the corner pieces so now all 
you need is the conduit......
 You can use the poles that the swap meeters have to hold up their blue 
tarps, they are just corners that conduit slids in.......

 its pretty big , as big as a Westy Tent and much bigger than the Sundial 
Awning.....about 10 x 7 ft

 Shipping......its heavy !, and even folded up is large, so probably 
Greyhound would be
 the easiest.... 
 or you can come over and get it......los angeles area.....
