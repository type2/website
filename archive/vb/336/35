Try any truckstop, or place that carries parts for big diesel trucks.   
I drive a yard truck where I work and all of our trucks have them inside 
to circulate air in the poorly airconditioed cabs.  I can tell by the 
way they were installed that it wasn't a factory deal either.

They show up brand new at weird places like job lot, flea markets, nat'l 
wholesale liquidators, etc.  I'm almost positive I've seen them at T.J 
maxx (a discount clothing store here in CT), near the registers, too.  
Might want to try Wal-Fart also.

Good luck
