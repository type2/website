Dave, I have seen many problems with slightly shorted starter solenoids
that build up a little fuzz between the contacts while sitting. Your
battery is connected right to the solenoid.

Subject: [VB] Suggestions for tracking battery drain?


Anyone have any suggestions on methods for tracking a battery drain?
All of a sudden the battery is dead after two or three days.  The
battery is new, less than a few hours of run time and few starts.
Nothing has really been hooked up lately.  The is on my Bus that's not
on the road yet.
