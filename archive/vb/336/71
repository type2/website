Subject: Re: [VB] continuing saga of 61

Yea, I remember 6 years ago this list was hopping with action. I had my
email disconnected for a week and a half while I moved from apartment to
house back then and I came back to almost 1500 emails since I didn't cancell
VB during that time. Seems like we were getting over 100 VB emails per 24hr
period back then. It was awesome.

Man, that took a long time with my old dial-up connection. haha
