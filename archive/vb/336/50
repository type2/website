Subject: Re: RE: [VB] re: dynamat

I recently did my 60 Standard.  I picked up 100sq ft of material called fatmat, basically a knockoff of the dynamat extreme.  Was $100 and covered all of the walls, double layer over the engine, and some portions of the roof.  I am very pleased with the results and it was easy to install.

I got it at www.fatmat.com
