We've brought ours there before. Shade, water, leashes, treats. That's all 
they needed. I think as soon as they see/smell what's cooking they'll just hang 
around the grill nicely. 

I'm signing up for the old fart camp. Dunno who's crashing at our home on 
Thursday yet. Whomever arriving this area early please feel free to come to our 
place. 928-526-4305 home, 928-606-3896 cell for directions.
