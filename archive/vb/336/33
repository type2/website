Subject: Roof rack clamps

Hey everyone,

With Jerome coming up, I just picked up a 1/2 length industrial roof rack at the Familienfest show today.

The kicker is, it doesn't have any clamps.

Does anyone out there in VBListland have 4 horseshoe style roof rack clamps they would be willing to part with?  Dinero is ready to send out.....

Thanks,

Beto
