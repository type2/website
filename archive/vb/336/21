Subject: John Brown's Buses, October 15-17, 2004

I just wanted to let everyone know that John Brown's Buses will take place in Harpers Ferry, WV (only 65 miles from Baltimore and
Washington D.C.)  on October 15-17. The web site has been updated for JBB 2004 http://www.johnbrownsbuses.com
<http://www.johnbrownsbuses.com/>  and has all the current information.  Please join us and enjoy the camaraderie and fall colors in
historic Harpers Ferry.
 
Joy thru air,
