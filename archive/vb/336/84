Subject: Noisy bus

My '63 Sundial started life as a panel (hence the high vents) and has a
bulkhead behind the driver's seat. I use my bus as a worktruck, so the cargo
area is very spartan, just a hinged plywood bed. I can load it up with work
equipment or camping gear as needed. As a hoot, I also decorate the cargo
area with red satin and velvet and show it as the Lady's Man bus with Frank
Sinatra music and a working fireplace. It all comes out after the show.

After failing to make much difference with Dynamat and other noise dampers I
finally settled on separating the two areas. Behind my head I installed a
window, the rear windshield from an old Nissan pickup. I framed  it in
cedar. Now I can clearly hear the engine, but it is louder through the
driver's window than inside. It also allows me to heat only the small
driver's compartment. I installed one of those noisy in-line heater fans and
now, no longer how frozen it is outside, I have to turn down the fan or open
a window because it gets too hot inside.
