Torch down roofing comes in a roll of about 50 feet and is about 3 feet
wide and is basicly a sheet of rubber/tar like material. It is also
typically about a 1/4 inch thick. It is traditionally installed on flat
roofed buildings by laying it out, cutting to size and then using a
broad flamed propaine torch to heat it along the side that is going to
stick to the roof. It is heated untill the back side becomes goowy and
then it is pressed into place. I rember as a kid way back in school that
I knew another kid that had used this material on a semi trailer he had
in the back yard  converted into a place to play his drums. As I rember
the sound level was droped by a good amount once this was done.
Anyone else used this stuff?

You might be on to something here. Whatever is the most sound deadening
seems like it would be well worth the try. What does the torch down
material look like? Does it come in sheets, roll roofing? Can you send
some pictures? Dave
