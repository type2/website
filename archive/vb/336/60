Subject: re: dynamat & insulating between the floor and belly pans

I did something similar to my car recently (not a VW) and it worked really
well.  I couldn't find any of it at Home Depot or Lowes but did find it at a
company called ABC Supply Company.  They offer it in 33.5 foot lengths and
whatever width you want.  I used the 12" wide stuff and it was $33 for the
roll (so, about $1 a sq. ft.).  Here is a link to their 36" wide stuff.

and the 12" wide stuff.

You can order it online or go to your local store (which is what I did)

Hope it helps.
