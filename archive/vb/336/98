Nice job - Here's mine:   $20 at a swap, some old blinkers and  
headlights and some flourescent paint.  It has a blacklight trained on  
it. The problem I have found is because of the bowed nature, of the  
front, I should have had the top lean over more, becuase peoples knees  
keep knocking the emblem off, and their boots leave skid marks in the  
bottom of the "V".  Otherwise, very functional and head-turning and fun.
