Subject: Jerome, List-less activity

This bus content is we are heading south after a long stay in the PNW, 
in the primer gray 59 DDr w/t with trailer loaded from Bremerton today 
via Clara's,  Bend, OR., maybe Bug a  rama in Sacto, Sunday? then the SF 
bay area for a while.
It has been great to MEET some new faces in the PNW thanks for the camp 
out VeeWee ;)
We do not know is Jerome will work out but do plan or Solvang, CA.
Got to finish packing
P & C
