I agree with that. Even though I chime in quite often, probably more
than people would like, I also read the daily e-mails to see if there
are anymore tidbits I can glean off of them.

It may be true that activity on the list is not as great as it once was.
BUT, I'll bet there is a lot of folks like me who hide quietly in the
bushes, while soaking up the accumulated knowledge and experience of
Matt Roberds, ronnie, VeeWee, Clara and many, many others.

Sure, there's an occasional stupid question or comment, but I, for
one,hope that doesn't slow anybody down.

Keep it coming, everyone!
