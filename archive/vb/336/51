The regulator would "see" the total voltage across the two batteries,
so it would "notice" one of the two being discharged.  However, it may
not charge up the string as fast as it would with a single 12 V battery,
for the reason you mention:

It is possible to charge series strings of batteries that are at
different states of charge, but it requires charging techniques that
are a little more complex than what the generator and voltage regulator
can provide.

In my opinion: it would work, but not as well as a straight 12 V or 6 V
system.
