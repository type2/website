Subject: "Partial" 12V conversion. Has anyone done it this way?

Does anyone on the list have experience with this partial 12V
conversion? It is described on this web page:

http://www.inertia.org/acvwjyro/acvwjy/6-to-12.htm

This is about all it says about it:
"In the case where the engine is being replaced with a newer one and
the charging system will be 12 volt, my advice is to put another 6 volt
battery under the back seat, run the car off one of the pair but charge
both in series from the 12 volt source. 


           6 V battery           6 V battery
            ________              ________
           | +    - |            | +    - |             common
+----------|-o    o-|-----+------|-o    o-|------------ ground
|          |________|     |      |________|

12                        6 
volts                    volts"

I'd use the 12V point for CD/DVD player for the kids (and maybe for the
headlights and tail lights) and leave the rest 6V. Though the
description doesn't go into it, I would use identical batteries.

I see possible problems though because of the inequity in the need for
current to recharge the batteries. The "main" 6V battery would be drawn
down by the starter and need lots of current to recharge it, but would
the regulator even sense this with the other battery being fully
charged? And would the non-starting battery even allow that much
current through to the other battery when it hasn't been discharged as
much and doesn't need the same amount of current?

Any advice from the group on this method?
