Subject: Bus parts for sale in Norcal.

Just thought I'd give everyone a first shot at these before they go to the
swap meet.
A few key parts out of a 1966 bus being parted out right now.

**Front beam w/lowered spindles drum to drum. Includes tie-rods, good center
pin, and drums.
Not sure of the operating condition as I never drove the bus. Parts sold
as-is.
$375.00

**Big nut tranny, drum to drum.
Rebuilt by previous owner. Never drove bus so cannot verify condition. No
brakes inside, just backing plates and drums. Includes newer KYB gas adjust
shocks, front shift coupler, and all tranny mounts (front and rear in good
shape).
$400.00

Parts are located in Concord, Ca.
Need the space so you can pick up on your way to or from Bug-O-Rama this
weekend.

Thanks,
Dave Barnes
