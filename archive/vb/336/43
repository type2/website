Subject: re: roof rack clamps

I have a drawing of a set I made for an original 3/4
length roof rack.  A local company said they could
make them for about 25 bucks each.  You can submit the
drawing to a local manufacturer and maybe get a better
deal.  Let me know and I'll email you a photo and a
copy of the drawing.  The design looks close to the
original only stronger, ie., 1/8 thk steel.
