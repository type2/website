Subject: Re: [VB] "Partial" 12V conversion. Has anyone done it this way?

Hi R,
Looks like a good way to make something simple, more difficult, prone to more 
maintenance problems and possibly electrical fire.  If you are going to 
change over to a 12 volt engine then just change the bus over to 12 volts.  Other 
than changing ALL the bulbs to 12 volt ones, the only major hitch is either 
installing a 12 volt wiper armature or a voltage drop in front of the wiper motor.
  We have run 12 volt engines with 6 volt 200mm FW and 6 volt starter for 
many, many years with no problems of burnt out starters.
