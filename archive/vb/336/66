 roofing torch down material (used on flat roofed buildings). I figure

Another similar product but  a lot easier to work w/ is bituthane such as
"Ice & Water Shield" by WR Grace- it's a rubber-like roll roofing
underlayment for roofing that is applied in areas where ice damming occurs
at roof eaves, etc.  You can nail thru it & it seals itself!!!- the stuff is
about 1/8" thick, comes in 3' w. rolls & self adheres to whatever it's
placed on. It's like tar w/o the mess.

FWIW,
