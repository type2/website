Will it stay up if it is spray glued on the roof?  I looks kinda like it
has a backing on it.  Wouldn't the backing come off?

Rob ,how bout putting it under the carpet and not in
the engine compartment  but on the floor above the
compartment , maybe even a throw rug  to cover the
dynomayt if you don't have carpet back there on the
floor , as for the headliner use a headliner of
dynomat , just spray glue it in , it would really help
the sound and heat, hope this makes alittle sence.
