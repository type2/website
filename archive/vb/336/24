Subject: wanna smoke?

hey all,

   i got rita runnin again..but barely. i cleaned and
adjusted the choke. so she is operational again. my
question is, is she supposed to smoke from the tail
pipe any? i mean, while she is running, i go back and
look at the exaust and see a LITTLE bit of smoke
coming out from the exaust pipe. its not white or blue
smoke. its black, but barely noticeable. is this
normal? i mean, you have to look at it for a minute to
see the smoke. fuel mixture? thanks, still need a good
carb,
josh
