Subject: Re: [VB] Suggestions for tracking battery drain?

How about attaching a digital voltmeter to it while looking for the short
that drains it? When the drain is discovered, the battery will stop draining
and the digital voltmeter stops decreasing in voltage?

Anyone have any suggestions on methods for tracking a battery drain?
