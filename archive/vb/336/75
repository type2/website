Subject: RE: [VB] Diminished list activity/Jerome

I have met more people and learned so much from this list it still surprises me pretty often.  I will be working or repairing some item, and I actually know how to do it, w/o doing the repair before.  Some kind of an list-osmosis thing, you just read so many times over the years and it just sinks in.

I also have some really great friends due to this list.

It always seems to go through the ups and downs over the years.  But I'm certain it will remain strong.

We've also been getting some really great new blood lately.  Can't wait to meet some of you guys along the way.  Some if you lurkers post up and let us know what you drive, what you're doing with it, and where you are located....

Now....who is gonna be heading to Jerome??
I know Sean D., Ronnie, JP, Clara, Ricky and myself will be out there....anyone else?
If anyone is interested, my family and I will be leaving So-Cal real early on Thursday morning and making our way to Ricky's place in Flagstaff.  We will be planning some community meals for the weekend and picking up the needed supplies.  Anyone who is interested let me know, they have been tons of fun at the past two Jerome.

Later,
Beto
