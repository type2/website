Hello Everyone        
 
    
    I am wondering if anyone would be parting out a bus that is not worth
saving. I am looking for a rear drivers side corner for my 65 deluxe. I
uncovered a good inch of body filler to find not allot of metal left. I
bought the Wolfsburg West replacement but it's not the same and thinner. I
live on Central Coast of California and wouldn't mind driving a bit for it
or paying for part plus shipping. 
 
 
Any Help Appreciated,
Eric
65 Deluxe
