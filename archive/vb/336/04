Subject: Re: [VB] jerome... dog friendly?

  This year Jerome will be interesting as The heads of The Last Resort are not coming (where last years all nighter 
was held) but the naked dancing girls on the stage at 2 A.M. help set that mood!!!. 
Every year Jerome changes as to where the noise is and is unpredictable. You think you have chosen a guiet spot but 2 
camps down turns into all night, party central, rubber Johnneys (just ask Van Bondo about that).
