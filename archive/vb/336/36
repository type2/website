Subject: Commercial/Bice bumper search

Well,

The subject line says it all.  Anyone have any of the commercial/Bice/heavy
duty/truck bumpers for sale or have any leads?

They are the ugly plate steel, sometimes diamond plate aftermarket bumpers.
They usually have bars that resemble small a brushguard on the front bumper.

TIA,
