CONFESSIONS OF A VIRGIN CAMPER
The MO-KAN Campout
by Kerry Murphy-Zimmerman (Rob's Friend)



    When you're a virgin, you don't have a clue.  Oh, you've seen it on =
TV,
read
about it and thought about it, but when it's time to do it, IT can be =
pretty
scary.  I was happy to have a more experienced partner to teach me the
wonderful world of camping.  Friday was tiring for me after the long =
drive
to Topeka (which translates to "Bring More Deodorant Next Time").  The
caravan of Buskatiers including Rob and I, Bindy, Shelby, Shawn, Matt,
Daisy, Terry and Justin stopped on the way to help a stranded Harley.  =
Terry
says it's good Karma to help another air cooled vehicle.  Never really
thought about it, but it couldn't hurt!  I met many wonderful people on
Friday and was surprised to see so many camping and a great set up right =
by
the racetrack.  Justin and I went to the dirt track for awhile to get =
even
grittier than we already were and then it was time to sleep in a tent.  =
I
slept pretty well until the middle of the night when I awoke to some =
very
strange sounds 3 feet outside our tent.  The sounds reminded me of that
campfire scene from Blazing Saddles if you know what I mean.  Rob told =
me
who was sleeping there and I could barely contain my giggles.  I won't =
tell
you who it was (but he's 26 and his name rhymes with CAT). Rob had 2
sleeping bags with inflatable mattresses attached.  I thought that was
pretty cool until I woke up in the morning.  I informed him that I was
flat....and so was my mattress.  His, of course, was still fully =
inflated.

    Saturday was the show and flea market.  I was amazed at how many =
people
brought their cars to show.  It was really great fun.  Rick and Marty =
and
their crew did a wonderful job and I know they worked hard to set it up.
Rick has another virtue as I discovered on Friday.  He is THE SHOWER =
MAN!
Without him, I do believe that by Saturday night, I would have melted =
and
died like the wicked witch.  He set up the most incredible shower and =
was
kind enough to offer it's services to everyone.  I really should have =
kissed
him right then, but I controlled myself for once.  We also watched some
races on Saturday and that was also a good time.  By the time we got =
back to
the campsite, I was a big red lobster.  I got a good burn and I was =
getting
very very grumpy (as poor Rob can attest to).  We all went to eat at a =
yummy
barbeque place.  When we returned, I took a shower.  Wow, I felt like a
different person and I swear it wasn't just the cold beer.

    I would like to thank everyone I met for making my first time a =
success.
I'm still a little confused about your love for the VW's, but now I =
think of
VW owners like people who have old, slow, funny looking dogs.  =
Bystanders do
double takes, laugh or think "yuck", why would anyone want one of those =
or
who in their right mind would have a dog painted like a cow?  But the =
owners
have a sense of humor like no other and will tell you about all the =
tricks
they can do and stories of all the places they've been together.  I =
found
out that it's not about the looks, but the spirit behind it that =
inspires
their owners. They go slower, smell the roses and laugh alot more.  =
Well,
because they have to.
