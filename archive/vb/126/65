Subject: re:bus jacks

speaking of jacks....when i put my jack in the hole on the rear passenger
side of my bus, the top of the jack ants to hit the hinge on the door, ie I
cant get that thig that sticks out of the jack all the way in without the
jack hitting the hinges? does this mean i have the wrong jack, or are my
tires too small, or does this happen to everyone?

thanks
