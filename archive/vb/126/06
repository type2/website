Subject: need advice on traveling back east

On June 16th my wife and I will be leaving Reno Nevada
and heading to Niagara Falls in our 1979 Westy for the
Busses by the Falls event on the 21,22,23 and then
will be traveling to New York City to see the sights.
We are unsure where we will go after NYC, but we have
five or six weeks to travel about.
I am asking anyone on the list in the NYC area to
offer any suggestions or advice (or maybe a place to
park for a night) on getting around the city. We plan
on going to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island and
since I have never been to NYC, I have no idea what to
expect.
If there is anyone in the area who would offer travel
advice or know of any places we should not miss,
please e-mail me and let me know.
Thanks so much in advance
