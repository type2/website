Subject: '59 SC....bed refurb

I've been slowly sandblasting the bed of my '59 Single Cab. It's a 
solid bed with no holes in it. As I'm blasting away the old crusty 
paint and surface rust, I'm seeing that there is pitting in the metal 
where rust has attatcked it some. There are even a few pin 
holes...which are almost "not there".  Also, the bed was used like 
you'd expect a truck to be used. It's got small dents and 
imperfections in the "ribs".

Now, I'm not looking for a perfect truck. But I would like to make it 
look good since I'm gonna be painting it eventually. But i want to be 
able to use the truck. So, what's the best way to fill the pits? Can 
I use filler primer and let it build up, or even glazing putty or 
something?

I'm mainly concerned about how well any kind of filling will hold up 
if I haul stuff in there.

What have you guys done with your daily driver trucks?

Lastly, anybody out there done a DIY wood slat job? Any budget wood 
available at Home Depot or Lowe's that will work? Any suggestions 
here would be great.
