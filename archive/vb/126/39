Subject: Thanks to the list!



Last night I posted a request for info (and maybe a
place to stay)on traveling back east to NYC and area,
and I would like to thank everyone who took the time
to reply. The response was tremendous!
I will be asking for more detailed info as the trip
gets closer....

Again, thanks so much!
