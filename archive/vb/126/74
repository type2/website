Rachel --

We Volks-culture-deprived Pennsy types will be agog and slack-jawed at the
sight of a gen-u-wine California bus, plates and all!  Housepaint,
especially applied by a brush, is considered very chic here, where air
pollution from the Rust Belt meets the salty Atlantic air. My '67 Deluxe
sports some patches of it near the rear corners, lovingly slathered on by an
earlier owner. Actually, mine may be red *barn* paint, which comes fairly
close to matching the original, highly-oxidized Titan Red. Come to think of
it, adding some Pennsylvania Dutch hex signs would really set the old bus
off!   8^)

Looking forward to meeting you, Jon and the '59...
