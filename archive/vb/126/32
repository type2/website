Subject:  RE: [VB] DC rear bed metal work

The metal would be well stretched and you'd have to relieve
it in some way whilst pushing it up?  Porta power type thing
that David's talking about from below and shrinking heat
or some cuts (weld up after pressing up and the gaps close?)...

The guy that did the body work on the 59 dc used an air hammer and/or some
type of press that pushed on the areas from underneath... I think he had
over 1 week of work alone on it.


>>>>He asked how straighten the bed in a DC that was warped
from the DPO throwing heavy things in it. These aren't little dents, they
are large areas of stretched metal running between the bed supports. Can't
use a dolly here, unless you have one about 3 feet x 2 feet with a body
hammer about the same size.

I'm doing this right now on my DC. Flailing away with a big ball peen hammer
is working quite well for me. The bed pretty close to being straight. I only
have to apply a little (GASP!) filler to make it look brand new.
