Howdy Campers,

I am not the usual begging kind, however after all I have been through in
trying to get these pix up (I downloaded 3 different free ware packages and
almost 17 stupid hours) I AM BEGGING EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU, to visit this
Ohio Valley Tribe edition of the Full Moon Bus Club and view my stinkin
pictures.

PLEASE.

Hey everyone, don't forget, make plans NOW, to visit us in Central Ohio for
Dixie Bus Gathering.  I will be posting a page (yeah right) here soon.

I challenge all the Southeast Moonies......many of us drive 500 miles to
come south, howabout you come north and still be in DIXIE????

The Dixie Bus Gathering, August 8-10.
