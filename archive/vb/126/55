Sean I don't know you and apparently you don't know  Britt!  So 
before you start passing judgment find out what and who you 
are talking about!
Britt has broken down WHILE towing another bus for a fellow 
VBer.  Britt has traveled across the US in the Roadcow and
the trip before this one he towed Bryant Brecht(sp) half way to 
a show/campout in the so.east and then all the way back to Kansas
out of the kindness of his heart!  He has given up his leisure time
at campouts to help others pull their engine/tranny for repairs 
without ever asking so much as a thank you.
 Sean, you say you don't want to start a 'flame war'- TOO LATE!
   Lou in Havasu
