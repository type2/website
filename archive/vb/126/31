Subject: DC rear bed metal work

The guy that did the body work on the 59 dc used an air hammer and/or some
type of press that pushed on the areas from underneath... I think he had
over 1 week of work alone on it.


>>>>He asked how straighten the bed in a DC that was warped
from the DPO throwing heavy things in it. These aren't little dents, they
are large areas of stretched metal running between the bed supports. Can't
use a dolly here, unless you have one about 3 feet x 2 feet with a body
hammer about the same size.

I'm doing this right now on my DC. Flailing away with a big ball peen hammer
is working quite well for me. The bed pretty close to being straight. I only
have to apply a little (GASP!) filler to make it look brand new.
