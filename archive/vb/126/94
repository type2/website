(Sorry, early Friday-Fake birth announcement...)

Baby boy born under a badsign.

Damien Luther Vanbondo
Born: 06/06/02 at 06:00 hrs.
Weight: 6.66 lbs

Funny birthmark on head but hair will eventually cover it. Webbed
fingers-minimal. Strange that baby has teeth already. Wife not into breast
feeding after first attempt.

(real birth still pending)
