Hey there-

I'm a grad film student at USC in Los Angeles and am starting pre-production
on my final thesis project before graduation.  I'm wondering if you know
anyone who is interested in renting their bay(yeah, I know *some* people
hate them...) window bus out to us for a week or so?

We have some money in our budget for the bus, and it would be insured for
the time we've got it.  It would be fantastic if we could send a message out
to your members since it's a way someone could make some quick money from
their bus.

Please contact me at keith(-at-)discomedia.com if you can help or know anyone
that can!  (or if you have other suggestions on how to proceed)

man, I love your site, but you probably hear that all the time.  It's been a
great resource for us as we've been putting our film together.  Thanks for
having it.  

Keith Adler
