Subject: RE: [T2] VW Infringement?

Huh? Is this like arguing whether a person full of bionic parts is still a
person? If you buy a bunch of unofficial VW parts and put them on your VW,
at what point does it stop being a VW and become a rolling trademark
infringement? Does that mean the next time you go to register your vehicle
you put "Mongrel" in the Vehicle Make field? I mean, if you want to go that
route you can go to all kinds of extremes.
