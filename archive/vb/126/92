Subject: RE: [VB] How do they do it??

On my tubbed 9 inch ch3vy n0v(-at-) pro-street (probably the stupidest car I
ever built), I had to roll the fender well lips (saves about .5 inch) to
get the tires 32sx16.5x15s on. Tires weighed a ton.
I suppose if the spring plate seperation from body trick didn't work
(sounds like it could), you could look for narrower rear brakes, which I
would assume means disc conversion...
Has anyone ever NARROWED a VW rear? Gasp!
