Subject: My bus loves grease...THAT MUCH?!?-----OG axle boot clamps/tool?

Volks, greased the front end again, since I have about 350 miles on the
spindles I rebuilt. I took out the OG torsion tube housing zerks,
cleaned them, shot a test through, and reinstalled. I proceeded to dump
a WHOLE TUBE (full size cart gun) in just the beam!!!!! WOW. It took
that to really push out the old stuff.Just kept coming out (the old
stuff, just started seeing new when I stopped on each)...Couldn't help
but again chant Clara's mantra, "MY bus loves grease, my bus loves
grease, boy my BUS REALLY LOVES GREASE!"
I actually RAN out before I could get the fourth the way I want it,
going under again tonight to give that one a few more pumps, clean out
the old sh1t.
I think a 5 lb can and bigger gun might be in order!

Is there any way to get OG axle boot (like the heater tube clamps)
clamps and I assume a special tool is required to use em? I have the
brass gear clmaps on my one piece boots, but they go all the way tight,
and still ooze a little when I park...Annoying... I need like one more
notch in the clamps....Are they, if available, reuseable?
