Let me make this even more confusing.

My 65 Deluxe, which is a seven seater, has the strap and two hooks on 
the pillar right behind the cargo door, two hooks directly opposite on 
the driver's side and two hooks and a strap on the driver's side right 
behind the driver's door. The hooks are over the strap in both cases. 
That's 6 hooks and two straps.
