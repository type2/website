Subject: Re: [VB] My bus loves grease...THAT MUCH?!?-----OG axle boot clamps/tool?


Better FLAPS will have the "one-time" clamps. There is a 
special but inexpensive tool that looks like a weird can 
opener/clamp to fasten 'em. I've seen smaller clamps at 
the local homebrew store for keg lines. I use modern, 
high-tech ratcheting nylon cable ties.
