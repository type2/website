Subject: Britt (roadcow) update

		  I just talked to Britt and he's in good spirits and thanks
everyone for all there help. He said the best thing is that there are 3
girly bars around him but he hasn't gone in one YET! If his new trans shows
up as planned he feels he should be on the road by 3 this afternoon. We
found a back-up plan also. I got an e-mail from a guy in Austin Texas who's
parents live in Amarillo and he just happens to have a 79 trans there. Britt
is trying to get hold of him now in case the trans he gets is no good. Hate
to see him have to do this twice.

Ronnie  again thanks to all that have helped
