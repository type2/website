Subject: RE: [VB] How do they do it??

You're best answer to that question is to get a small scissor jack from the
wreckers and jack the spring plate down so that the drum sticks out from
under the wheel well more.  This should solve your problems and you won't
have to remove the drum everytime you take your wheels off.
