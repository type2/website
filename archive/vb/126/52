Subject: East coast rim trade? 2 fer 1! 

If you have 1 decent 14" bus rim (not rusty pits, bent, etc.), I would
like to trade 2 15" rims. We're both talking wide fives. I have 15 J4s
slotted tI/ghia wide 5s OG paint (beat) usual back surface patina, very
restorable. I think all the clips are on too. Crappy old snow tires on
em both. In eastern PA. Will travel some for definite trades.
