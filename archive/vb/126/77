Subject: How do they do it??

Well, I put the Bus Boys IRS lowering kit on the back tonight. I finally
have a (pretty) level bus again after having the front lowered for the
last 3k miles. The quality of the components is VERY good and was much
easier than I thought. Not sure how that translates to a RGB kit, but
mine was pretty easy and fun.

The only real b*tch of the entire process was getting the 195/50-15
tires & wheels back on. My rear fenders are neither cut nor flared and I
ended up having to put the wheel into the fender well over the stub axle
and _then_ put the brake drum on inside it. Wouldn't go on any other
way.

Can't wait to get a flat and have to pull half my rear suspension to
change the tire. <rolling eyes> Anybody out there have any suggestions
on how to get around this? Please spare me the "put it back to stock"
comments. Matt & Katie said that nearly the entire time I was installing
the stuff. :-)

Thanks,
