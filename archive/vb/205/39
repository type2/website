Subject: Re: [VB] Gas Heater

Below 20F when getting in and out of the bus, 5,000 BTU won't heat up the
bus very fast, if you don't drive far to work, you'll still be cold.  Plus,
you've got to carry a bottle of propane somewhere, not a good idea to carry
it inside the bus. 

These are nice heaters, but for the price and the space they take, you could
have a really nice gas heater that takes fuel from the same tank as the
engine and puts out 4 times the amount of heat:  20,000 BTU.
