Subject: RE: [VB] Hinge Covers & wdges

Its true. Beto's 65 sundial walk-thru former panel had hinge covers, as Beto 
said. When this thread began, I thought it was going to be about those wedges 
on the outside of the cargo door hinges, towards the front of the bus. If 
anyone feels like sharing any information on those, I am interested in 
learning their story. Thanks for letting lurkers like me learn from you. Billy
