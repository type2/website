I was going to keep this under wraps until the Buses got here, but I 
guess now is a good a time as any.............

I picked up 2 of those Swiss postal Buses (RHD, walkthru, drivers side 
slider) from Europe and am awaiting their arrival. The idea was to have 
them here before OCTO, but Kelly Park is looking more realistic.

1 of them will be for sale.

I know of 4 (the 2 I have,  the yelow/ black one belongs to a guy named 
Kip in Florida, and there is another one for sale in the UK). David 
Mayes has a book with some pictures of one as well. I've seen 2 
different door handle configurations for the slider. This was dependant 
on if teh slider was original from VW or done by the coachbuilder for 
the Swiss post.

There are pictures of Kips on Everetts site (Thoms too I suppose) look 
under Bulli Brigade.

Here's a link to a picture of 1 of mine, probably the one I'll 
keep.................
