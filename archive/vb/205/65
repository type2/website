I love the kingpin ride myself.  Feels firm, not squishey.  First time I
drove a split I was shocked 
at how different it was from my 73 Westy, and had to have the split. 
Much better on windy mountain roads too.    Dunno what the deal is with
th IRS mod.   
--------------------------- Clip -----------------------
I've got a 66 Splittie Westy with IRS and Ball Joint Front suspension.
Those modifications haven't impressed any potential buyers on my 66.
The New stock brakes are more than adequate to stop the bus in panic
stops and work well in general driving.
I like the fact that I can run 70+ miles an hour with the IRS (69-74
Tranny) without over revving the engine.
This little Splittie at 2600 pounds is a real rabbit compared to the 83
Westy at 5300 pounds I've been driving for the last eight years. (1600 cc
modified engine)
I haven't been on any 2000 mile trips in it but in local 180 mile round
trips on the interstate it handles well and runs 70+ mph with ease.
Being lighter it is effected by cross winds more but slowing down always
corrects that.
I've never driven or owned a pure stock Splittie but I've seen some very
nice pure stock vans at the local independent classic VW repair shops.
It was a daily driver until I started Hot Rodding it around town and now
the clutch starts slipping about 3200 rpms (guess that is peak output on
the engine). Its still a driver but I just can't run faster than 60 in
4th gear before it starts to slip.

There are some suspension pictures at this site. If you want to see
anything specific I can take digital pics and send them to you.
