Subject: Engine Tin

Does anyone know of a web page with pics of type 2 engine tin vs type 1 engine
tin?

My bus is a 60 and the engine is from a 61 beetle.  I suspect that the engine
tin is right for a beetle but not right for a bus - but I do seem to run
pretty cool.

I don't have pieces of tin that run from the bottom of the heater boxes to the
engine.  I do have pieces the go right under the cylinders.

TIA
