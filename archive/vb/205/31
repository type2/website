OK Clara/Volks -

Spent a few minutes today clearing out the parcel tray, trying to get a
better look at the wiring.  Just to clear anyones(including my own)
assumptions that I know what I am doing, my first assessment that I don't
have a drop was wrong.  I DO have a voltage drop.  It is amazing what you
find, when you actually pay attention to what you are looking at...!

Clara, my motor is quiet as heck, but morbidly slow..Well let me rephrase
that last part.  It is USUALLY morbidly slow.  Today, I actually was able to
use it, without it getting stuck once...?  Make no sense to me...

Here is my next question based on my new discovery.  I have heard these
voltage drops could go bad.  Would it create MORE resistance, and less
volts?  I don't have a volt meter to measure the feed, otherwise I would
check...thanks...Oh, does a store like radio shack have these? - K
