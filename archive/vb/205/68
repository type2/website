The only good deals on ebay are the ones that are mis-listed, like
calling it a volswagen, or calling a tilt and bows a "bed liner"

Apart from the oviouss rust in the pix, that bus appears to have been
selectively re-sprayed.  I'm guessing the roof windows rotted out,
and the bondoed them up and re-painted the roof, hence the new seals.
In the shot showing the rear heater tube, check out the expanding
foam peeking thru the cargo floor.  I'll be you a beer the rocker 
was filler with foam, bondoed over, and painted.  Also check out
the off-white line at the line between the cargo floor and the
seat bulkhead - that's a new product caled "RCOR" - rattle can over rust"
And stevie wonder could see the rust on the cargo door sill.

If this much is easy to pick out from the pix, just think was the
underbelly looks like?
