Try this:  
remove the voltage drop that's there and connect the wires together.  
turn on wipers.
If they go like a bat out of heck, the drop got too strong.  I thought they 
wimped out when they went bad, but maybe some get too strong.  i dunno.
Think I've bought voltage drops at Schucks, or C.R.A.P., the round kind I 
think you need two (try one and if it doesn't slow it enough get another and 
run them in line)

You can run the wiper straight on 12V for a while and the way it's raining 
hard that may be nice for a bit, but it will torch the motor, so get a drop

the other idea is get a rheostat switch.  I haven't done this but J.P. did 
and the dash switch doesn't look stock, but you can adjust the speed of the 
wipers slow to fast.

 OK Clara/Volks -
 
 Spent a few minutes today clearing out the parcel tray, trying to get a
 better look at the wiring.  Just to clear anyones(including my own)
 assumptions that I know what I am doing, my first assessment that I don't
 have a drop was wrong.  I DO have a voltage drop.  It is amazing what you
 find, when you actually pay attention to what you are looking at...!
 
 Clara, my motor is quiet as heck, but morbidly slow..Well let me rephrase
 that last part.  It is USUALLY morbidly slow.  Today, I actually was able to
 use it, without it getting stuck once...?  Make no sense to me...
 
 Here is my next question based on my new discovery.  I have heard these
 voltage drops could go bad.  Would it create MORE resistance, and less
 volts?  I don't have a volt meter to measure the feed, otherwise I would
 check...thanks...Oh, does a store like radio shack have these? - K
