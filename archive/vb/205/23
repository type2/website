Subject: Need a fuse cover...

Hi all,

I was just down in the garage tinkering with my (stored away for the winter)
'June of 1959 Double Door Panel.  Stock as can be, and a real "gas" to drive
around (in better weather).  While crawling around, I just realized that I'm
missing a correct fuse cover for this Bus.  So if you've got an old, decent
shape six fuse cover correct for this '59 Bus in your spare Bus parts bin, and
you don't need it yourself, let me know off-list and we'll do a deal and give
your cover a new home.  Thanks for looking for me!
