Solved my inquiry.

Stan...How many ribs are on the top of the case just behind the bell
hsg???
3 ribs/=69-74 bus     6 ribs=76-79 bus   5 ribs with square sides are a
75 only bus
Other than that, it may be an early bug/bus double side cover trans which
are for all intets & purposes are all the same....
If the nuts on the tranny are silver nylocks, the trans is a rebuild from
Trasform...marginal at best
