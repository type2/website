Subject: z-bed kit

anyone install a bus-boys z-bed kit before??

I own a 58 kombi that I want to install a part time bed for those camping
occasions..the only thing ilike so far
is the ez-bed..does it work well? and how does it keep the height the same on
the seat to the rear cargo area so you can lay down?? does it require welding?
and last do you like it?


thanks,
nick
