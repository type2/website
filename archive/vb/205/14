Subject: hinge covers 2

Those are for high hinge buses only and then only some of those. don't know
why they're there, but I remember there was a thread on them a while back
with a couple of ideas. they aren't really a cover, they sort of fit
behind(facing the cargo doors) the forward hinge. never seen them on the
rear.

rear hatch hinge covers.
