Hi Nick,
We just figured out how to do that without modifying the SC you would just
need to make tanks that would grab/vice onto the under side of the frame work
under the bed.  Switching would not be needed just run a fuel line from each
to the tank in the normal position.  Just a reserve switch would be a good
idea to tell you when you only have 100+ miles left!
