Try contacting the People's Car Club, a tri-state VW club in the SW
Penna, western MD, northern WV area.  They are the Maryland chapter of
the VVWCA.  There is a website at http://www.gti16v.org/tpcc.htm. 
Perhaps the club has contacts that might be able to give you some
reliable leads on buses for sale.
