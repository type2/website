>hmmm, I am not sure I understand the problem or what you did.
        OK I've had this bus for 7 or 8 years and was driving through
Arcata, stopped at a stop sign started off in first went to shift into 2nd
and it wasn't there, lots of fumbling  did not want to go into 2nd and
finally found 2nd went on freeway 10 miles to Eureka stopped at a signal put
the  bus in first went to shift into 2nd stayed in first, oh no pulled over
looked under the bus and the rear shift coupler rubber had split and was no
longer connected together. drove home 5 miles in 1st, slowest vehicle in the
bike lane, looked and said easy new coupler and I'm on my way. Well ended up
taking all the couplers off and putting in new ones, reinstalled the
gearshift lever, spring and plate and no amount of ajustment from a neutral
starting point, forward back left right are any of the gears in the right
place kind of a kind of a H pattern with none of the gears where you would
expect them to be. 2 on the top left , 3rd on bottom left, the right side is
a mixture of 3 or 4 not sure which, to engage 1st gear I have to go the the
old reverse gear spot" to the left down and back"

I'll check that the reverse plate got put in right. seems like it took my
Son and I  2 hours to get the plate/shiftlever/spring back on. My other
thought was maybe the trans was not in neutral when I put it back to
together..or  it's internal.
