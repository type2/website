Warm greetings to all. Im glad to have found such a resource. I have a 64
Deluxe Bus that I have owned for about 11 years now, restored once in 94 and
about to get stripped down again. The thing that scares me the most this
time around is the rusted driverside lower door hinge. Looks like this will
not be fun.... anyone gone through this type of bodywork before lmk if there
are any tips to this. I am also looking for a shop (hopefully in California)
where I can get a 21 window headliner installed correctly. I am half tempted
to have the total restoration handled by a shop - if there is a shop
thorough enough.... anyone?

TIA for any input

Cheers

JT
