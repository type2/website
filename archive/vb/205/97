Subject: Re: [VB] Investment bus

I'm sorry folks, This would be an investment for sure, probably a large one.
Thom and the others pointed on alot of stuff and also there's no Deluxe trim
on it. I mean think about it fresh shiney paint outside crappy floors and
such, they washed the outside,,,i think not... the only way i would consider
this bus is to have one of the bulli boys out of tampa,,(ie Mark Rafferty,
Kris Hienka) check it out for me...To me shiny paint crapy floor= half ass
rusto (bend-over your fixin to get the wiener). Thats just and educated
guess from me no offence intended to anyone..later
