If it were me, instead of going IRS for the rear end, I would just have
Rancho or some other reputable transmission shop build a freeway flyer.
It's a lot easier than messing with an IRS conversion, and gives a similar
result.  As for the 68/Disc front end, it's probably a good idea, and a mod
that I'll consider making on my bus when I win the lottery.
