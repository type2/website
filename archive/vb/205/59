Subject: hockey sticksRe: [VB]  WTB  complete gearshift housing for a

From somewhere I accumulated a collection of hockey sticks.  (inner shift 
levers- the ones in thenose cone)  I think the bugs are different than bus, 
and the split case it yet another animal (longer), but dunno if bug split 
case is dif from bus split case.   Guess Icould look in the parts list.

Then if the bus rams something hard it can end up bending the hockey stick.  
Since they already are bent , you need to campare to tell, if the bends 
aren't in the right place, the tranny won't shift properly.   therefore, 
always check to see if the trans shifts in all gears by using hockey stick 
before installing, ya?   Just in case it had been in a bus that slipped on 
the ice going down Empire Grade (steep windy road) and rammed a tree, or 
something like that.

Other wise, you get to pull the tranny, figure it out, and swap hockey 
sticks, and then it works great.

 these type 1 shift levers to work, but this takes a specially tapered drill 
 bit that Eric is able to grind properly by hand and still it take a 1/8" 
 drill bit to clearance drill the center of this tapered hole to allow the 
tip 
 of the tapered bolt not to prematurely bottom out when threaded in.  BD used 
 type 1 inner tranny shift lever, but had an access plate under the rear seat 
 to unbolt it!
