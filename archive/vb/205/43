Thanks much for the welcome and the leads. Also wondering if anyone had
positive/negative feedback regarding the retrofit of 68/Disc front ends and
IRS rear ends to early busses. I don't think mine will ever be destined for
concours, so it would seem these "driveability" mods would be well received.
If there is a dark downside to this I'd really want to know.

Thanks again to all,

JT
