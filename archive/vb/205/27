Hi Doug,
Sounds like either electrical or carb problem.  Check you battery output and 
how much voltage is getting to the coil.  OG 6 volt coils have the post-1960 
terminal tabs riveted to the coil.  These riveted connections can loosen 
and/or corrode causing a voltage drop going to the coil and must be soldered 
to prevent this!!!  Afterward all these previous checks and repairs check for 
proper sparkplug arc color and if weak supect coil and/or condensor.  If you 
are still having starting problems you should probably remove and clean the 
carb, check jetting sizes, reset auto-choke.
