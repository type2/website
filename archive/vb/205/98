Subject: re:engine tin

does this engine tin you are talking about curve around each cylinder head?
I have seen some aftermarket stuff in magazines or on the internet, where
there is a piece of tin that wraps around each head. I will see if I can
find the link, or magazine ad.

actually i just found it-it is called super tin, and CB performance carries
it. www.cbperformace.com

no idea if this works or not...
