Subject: ADMIN: BuySell image upload fixed

All,

Over the past few days, it wasn't possible to add images to ads on the
Type2.com BuySell ( http://www.type2.com/buysell ).  This was a problem
with the database on the server and has now been fixed.  BuySell users
should once again be able to add images to their ads.

If you have any questions about this, let the BuySell administrator,
andy(-at-)type2.com , or me know.  Thanks!
