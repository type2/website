From discussions last year on this subject, you might try Krylon #1403
'Dull Aluminum' or Rustoleum 'Stone Gray'.  It was reported here that
West Coast Classics uses the Krylon in their restorations, and also that
the Rustoleum looks pretty close to original as a second choice.  If
your local home improvement store only has Rustoleum you may have to hit
a Sherwin Williams store to find the Krylon, which they own.
