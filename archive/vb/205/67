I have put the 68-71 in 3 of my buses, a 66 and 2
67's.
The only 'adjustment' I needed was to flatten the hump
on the middle rear edge of the tank with a block of
wood and a BFH.
The bay ledge is level, the split ledge has a hump.
After 'modifing' the tank, the fit was perfect. It is
a tight fit going in.
I cannot go over to Thom's site and answer mail using
Webtv but if I remember correctly, he does mention
having to flatten the hump on tank.
