Subject: Investment bus

Call me crazy but this looks like the best deal I've every seen for a 
bus. If someone could either buy it or help me figure out a way that 
would be great. I can't stand to see such a nice bus go to waist. It 
should be bought by someone who would truely appreciate it. getting this 
bus to Canada would be next to impossible or so outrageously expensive 
it would eliminate the investment opportunity.

 I really hope someone is interested out there.
