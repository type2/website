Subject: Type IV engine rebuild

My son's 1977 Type 2, fuel-injected, 2.L bus is in need of some work on the #1
exhaust valve.  (It's toast).  I have access to all the tools, books, and
video's one would need inorder to rebuild the heads along with the pistons and
cylinders, however I have never done this before.  I can do all the "usual"
things required of the vintage bus owner (by that I'm referring to pre-67 Type
I engine models).  My question is this:  I am debating whether to order
complete rebuilt heads from "B*S DEP*T", or take the valves to a machine shop
for the all the work and then reassemble the heads myself...any input???Steve
