Subject: Hinge covers...

Hi all,

As I recall, the "hinge covers" now being discussed, that mount to the hinges
for the side cargo doors, are in some ways still a mystery.  In all my years
of playing with Busses, I've only seen them "factory mounted" on the forward
most cargo  door(s), never "factory mounted" on the rear most doors, and only
on the earlier high-hinged door Busses.  Their real purpose is even a mystery,
although I'm sure VW engineers had some good reason to create them for use on
some Busses.  They really don't seem to add strength or real support to the
door hinges that they mount to, and they aren't really that aerodynamic, which
has lead some in the past to speculate that they were there to help prevent
snagging clothing on the hinge.  Believe whatever you want.  They are "cool"
looking when mounted up.  Over the years I've scrounged up several sets for my
Busses, and I even located a set of NOS correct rubber seals for two of my
sets about five years ago at the Classic weekend from someone who didn't know
what they were.  We're going to mount a restored set of hinge covers with the
NOS seals to our '59 Double Cab's side cargo door.  Hopefully someone out
there will discover an obscure VW technical bulletin that will finally answer
all the questions about these neat hinge covers.

Stay warm,
