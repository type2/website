Subject: Re: [VB] univeral grease?

It's a cosmic substance that keeps the universe spinning  frictionlessly.  
Unfortunately you might have to travel to the Galactic Hub to get  some.
 
Try perhaps and English-American dictionary.  Maybe you could use  
'all-purpose' or even 'wheel bearing' grease instead. The lithium stuff would  probably 
be fine too.

So...

the bentley says to lubricate accel. & heater cables  with "univeral 
grease"... What the heck is that and what kinda of look will my  local FLAPS employee 
give me when I ask for that?  I tried using some  lithium grease but that 
seemed to get  sticky...
