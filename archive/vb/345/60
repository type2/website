There are lots of brands out there.
I have been using the Loctite/Synco Super Lube for years on pretty much all 
my stuff. It is a synthetic NLGI grade 2 with teflon. It is waterproof and 
doesn't attract dust/dirt,( which is a real plus on the the mountain bike 
chain if you use the spray lube) It would be good for most jobs except the 
ones that need a molybedendum additive.
