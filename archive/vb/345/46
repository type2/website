Subject: Scouting Report: '63 Bus on eBay, in Connecticut

Hi all,

If anyone's interested in that '63 on eBay ending tonight, we drove up
from NYC this weekend to take a look. Its WAY too much of a project
for my current resources, but its got a certain distressed appeal. In
the interest of "rescuing forlorn or neglected buses", here is a quick
report which should expand a little on the cryptic auction listing:

Good Points:

--the engine turns with a good tug on the belt, is relatively clean
and dry and seems to have decent oil in it.
--Carburetor and throttle linkage look great. 
--engine compartment overall is basically clean and nearly rust free;
the paint even shines in some places deep within
--new primered engine compartment hatch (no lock); the old one looks
to be inside
--it has the old style refrigerator door handles and "T" handle on
rear hatch (maybe its a '62?)
--sheet metal all around is fair to good condition, all things
considered. front nose is good.
--many of the original parts are "stored" inside including both
bumpers with overriders, original front emblem (in good condition),
various trim and engine parts, fuel gauge (rust-tinged, clouded), old
license plates (registered May 86), etc.
--taillights, headlights, turn signals present and accounted for
--main structural rails at underbody basically sound
--cargo doors and passenger/driver doors all latch and close OK with
original hardware
--a few new/replacement parts not yet installed, nothing major
--keys are in the ignition (not originals)
--original headlight and flasher knobs in place
--turning the steering wheel moved the wheels without much trouble
--dash is NOT cut, and has radio block-out plate with very slight dent
(however it is rusted a bit along the base of the windows)


Bad Points:

--Rocker panels rusted through along their entire lengths
--Floorboards up front completely eaten away on driver side (look down
and see the ground and brake cylinder)
--All window seals are bad, most are drooping and almost fallen out
inside, door seals hard and brittle
--Front seats are mostly deteriorated and moldy/damp
--Gas/brake/clutch pedals not in place--no place to attach to! (but
replacements are present)
--Shifter handle not in evidence, but is probably in the bus somewhere!
--Rear hatch rusted in open position with 3" of pine needles and muck
in the balance
--Heater boxes rusted out
--Rust in just about every place you would expect, other than the
upper main body panels. The front cabin is just very damp
--at least two of the wheels are not correct wheels (perhaps 70s beetle?)
--Passenger door window frame missing (sliding glass is inside bus),
so passenger side has been open to elements
--A big chunk is missing out of the steering wheel crossbar, exposing
the rusted frame
--steering column is loose at dashboard attachment points
--turn signal lever is a rusty stalk
--parking brake lever is operational but is not connected to anything
--overhead vent switch moves with moderate effort
--Exterior of vehicle (including windows) is partially coated with moss or algae
--No interior trim panels are salvageable due to exposure (open window
and hatch)
--There is lumber and some other non-VW auto parts inside, along with
several VW hubcaps, some splitty and some bay
--It was difficult to see much of the interior because of all the
debris in back, may be some surprises
--you will need to expend some effort to dislodge it from its parking
space, try to beat the frost!
--It has clearly been sitting for a LONG time with all the
corresponding implications

The bus is actually located in Canaan, CT, which is about a mile south
of Massachusetts in the northwest corner of the state. Its a nice
drive.

Well, that's my attempt to find this orphaned bus a good owner. Not a
strong candidate for a parts bus, its all or nothing resto for this
Bulli. A classic swamper that might give someone a great "before"
photograph some day. Good luck if you go for it. I am not affiliated
with the owner in any way and so my information is just my own
personal opinion! Last time I checked it was $152 on eBay...
