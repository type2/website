Subject: Safary Windows

Hy everybody, im new in here! This is my first mail.

Well, i want to buy a "safary windows kit" to instal in my 1973 split. (here 
in Brazil the split bus was built until 1975) Since is imposible to find 
safary windows here because never was a "from the factory iten"  I need 
yours help.
Does anybody had a shop, or some where i can find the kit at a "good price"? 
I ask that because i had to pay transportation and the importation taxes 
(70% here in Brazil) Resuming the prices almost get4s double.

I apreciate your patience.

Best regards
