HELP! What did I do????

Trying to fix my VDO oil temp gauge tonight and now my truck won't start.  It
has power to the coil, and gas to the carb and it cranks over fine.  All
electrical is working perfectly(lights/gas gauge).  Its like the power lead to
the coil is not on(that's how it is acting).  I'm running a Compufire ignition
but not sure how to test it.  I've been driving the truck all day, so it has
to be something simple.  I've checked all the fuses and every wire I can think
of is just the way it was when the truck was running, except it won't start
now.

I did inadvertently hook up the VDO to ground and smoked a few jumper wires by
mistake, I replaced those but I don't see how that could have fried the
Compufire.  Anyone know how I should check the Compufire and/or the coil?  I'm
stumped and I know this is something totally simple and stupid.

Thanks in advance Matt ;-) !!
