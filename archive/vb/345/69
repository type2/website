Subject: Re: [VB] 21 window wire harness

Speaking of wire harness, here's a tip if you need a long, heavy power cable. My son wants to relocate the battery in his '71 BMW and knew that some '80's models had a trunk battery. We found one in a 325. It has a two cables, one is massive, 1/2" diameter, the other is the same guage as a headlight wire. One end is a post clamp, the other end has the same dimensions as a battery post. It's 11 feet and a few inches long! If you need serious power up front, look for one in the salvage yard.  Our yard charges 1.99 for a battery cable!
