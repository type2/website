Hi Steve,
If you just left the ignition on while fixing your gauge, and the points  
were closed while doing this.  You possibly fried one or more of  the:
Condensor, coil, compufire, and if you had points they would  be toast also!
  If you work with the ignition switched on for longer than a  minute or two, 
you should disconnect the wire that goes from the coil to  the 
points/compufire.
  Also if you toasted some wires by hooking up the oil temp  gauge, install 
an inline fuse before the gauge or hook the power  to the gauge on one of the 
ignition switched fuses in the fuse box!!!
