In my case it was the long bolt, that I discovered after putting a new
gasket w/ a light smear of sealant, but I sure wasn't going to take apart
the pump again just to remove sealant ;)

I agree except for one major factor in this install. The pump cover
has recessed areas where the fastners go. There is not room for the
normal oil pump nuts to go. Allen head fastners are called for in this
instance. Either way if I had paid more attention to this I most
likely would not have had any problems.
