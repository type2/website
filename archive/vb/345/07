Subject: shipping a bus across the pond

Hi all,
I am looking at a bus in Europe that I may buy, but was wondering
if anyone on the list had some experience with shipping busses to the US.
Any recommended carriers?
Horror stories?
Do's and don'ts?
I contacted a few companies on the web but no responses yet.
Any info is appreciated.


Larry
