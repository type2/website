Subject: '59 Single Cab... passenger dogleg rust

I decided the passenger dogleg on my truck was good enough to save. 
It has some rusted out metal, but most of it, especially the 
structural parts, were perfectly fine. So I just patched and filled 
the rusted out metal. Another little part of the metal work gets done.
