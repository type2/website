Subject: Fw: [VB] New engine

In my opinion, don't buy your bus from any mail order. Have it built by a
local builder, then you can go over and strangle him. Honestly , I don't
 know where you are, but there is probably a good builder near you. Call all
 the parts houses, VW clubs, even the local VW dealer and get some names.
Even if your builder is an hour or so away it will be better than mail
 order.

 To get a good engine made and modified will still cost you $2000+ (the GEX
 will too, by the time you're finished with shipping, long distance charges
 and meds) Your builder will have good, solid ideas for what you need and
 will help suggest way to get there.

 Honestly, if you don't modify the case too much (I'm not sure how much the
1776 requires) get good books and you have a mechanic friend or buy all your
 parts through one so he will answer the 3000 phone calls you will make to
 him, you can build it yourself. The first engine I had was built by a good
 mech who made a mistake and the engine threw a rod. It was a 1914 and since
 the case machining was all done, and thanks to the bus Gods there was 
little
 damage, I rebuilt it myself. It has been running strong now for 3 years and
 I know every inch of it.

 My bus is a 1914 DP with machined 88 cylinders and a stroker crank with 
dual
 Kadron carbs and a '68 bug transmission rebuilt with a 412 RP. I don't have
 any reduction boxes. It is a good highway machine with not great gas 
mileage
 and I don't think I can pull a trailer. I can move 1640 pounds of cargo up
 long hills in 3rd and 4th gears.

 There.
