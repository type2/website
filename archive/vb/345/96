Subject: RE: [VB] What did I do?

Steve,
whenever I replace points with an electronic ignition unit I allways keep a 
spare set of points and condenser in the vehicle, if not a distributor set 
up with points.  The units will work trouble free for years but if you do 
anything hinkey with the electrical they can die.  Allways disconnedt the 
battery when working on electrical and disconnect ignition when checking 
your work.
