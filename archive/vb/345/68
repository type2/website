Our 59 dd w/t the PO ran the wiring through the heater tube (yuck)
So we wanted heat, but after 2-3 days of tries could never get the 
harness back though the the correct path ( PO had removed all traces of 
the old harness ).  Our belly pans were too nice to hack up.  We had to 
run it through a new grommeted path in-board of the OG location.  The 
fish worked then, there just seem to much stuff next to the frame rail 
area to get the fish through.
P & C
