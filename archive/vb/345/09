John -

I had a 1776 built down in Florida for my 1963 panel van with performance
flow heads.  No problems three years and cross country trip later!  This is
even driving through 106 degree temps with no full flow or spin on filter.
(The spin on filter I originally had installed & replaced, IS A WHOLE NOTHER
STORY!!!)

I drove approximately 5 hour shifts, with an oil pressure gauge running
straight 40 wt oil.  Like I said.  No problems.  The oil pressure did drop
as low as 5-7 PSI but I think that is still OK.

I may not get 100k out of this motor, but I am sure by then I will be
wanting something new anyways.
