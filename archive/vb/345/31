Subject: '59 Single Cab...passenger rocker replacement done

I got my passenger side rocker replaced this week. I just got done 
spot welding the main rocker in place. I still have to clean some 
stuff up a little with the grinder, but all in all it turned out 
really good...especially for an amatuer.

I had to replace all the lower rocker on this whole side...from wheel 
well to wheel well. I used Wolfsburg West pieces for most of it and 
part of another truck for a little. Nothing is perfect, but it is 
more than I thought I'd ever do for this old truck.

I'm slowly getting the "fever" again. Feels good to get some solid 
work done. Here's the link for pictures of what's done so far:
