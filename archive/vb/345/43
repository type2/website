Subject: Transaxle removal

Well the transaxle on the '61 Panel is out.
Reasons for removal:
    1. replace broken front mount
    2. replace worn shifting coupler
    3. replace bushing that had worked out of the nose cone

Removal went fairly smooth. Shifting coupler screws didn't have safety wire,
but since they had been torque by Popeye I guess they didn't need it. After
rounding off one of the screws, I got my Craftsman bolt out socket and was
able to remove it. Note to self "order new coupler screws." One of the spring
plate bolts would not come out so I did what any self respecting shade tree
would do, I got the cheater bar and twisted the bolt head off.

Now for the questions:
    1. Upon draining the transaxle the oil had a few pieces of metal about 1/4
the size of a match head as well a quite a bit of brass flakes. I don't think
the oil had been drained since the rebuild. I bought this van 2 years ago and
haven't drained it myself, since it leaked ( mostly at the nose cone) I just
replaced oil occasionally. Also I haven't had any trouble shifting or popping
out of gear. Anyway do you guys think this is something to worry about?

    2. About the nose cone and bushing. Should I try to find a new bushing and
install it myself or are rebuilt nose cones available? The part number on the
transaxle is 113.301.103 E then below that AH 2671468.

Thanks for any help/advice.
