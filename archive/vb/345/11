So do you think bolting on high flow  heads is bad for a bus? <<
Hi John,
Definitely, if one is interested in more of a daily driver and not a drag  
strip monster.  Plus the for us the more torque, lower RPMing engines just  last 
longer (about twice or more) because they run cooler, and you go from  
praying for 19 MPG to a more managable 23 MPG.  

>>This issue also impacts on a Mexican dual port crate engine I  was able to 
pick up in Seattle for $300. I thought it would be good for the 65  Westy we 
are starting on next summer. What do you think?   <<
Personally we think the SP is torquer/better for the bus than DP.   Still it 
sounds like a good reliable engine, but we would take it apart  and add a CW 
crank.  We noticed how much quieter the CW cranked  engine runs.

Well do not thrash on it and keep your fingers crossed!

>>  I'm sure you meant forged crank here.   <<
No, just cast.  If one knows the limitations of the equipment and  does not 
push it beyond.....

>>  I'm also interested in your results with stroker crank.  IIRC the 72 is 
less work to fit the case.  <<
Good to hear.  We were thinking of going to the 72mm stroke in  the hopes 
that it was not too much.  Not sure where, but there comes a  point with too much 
stroke and the pistons get shoved more and more into the top  and bottom 
sides of the cylinders from the change in the angle of the connection  rods.  
Which is not good for longevity.  Yes there are stock  engines that run bigger 
stoke without this problem, but then they run much  longer connecting rods and 
this in turn means moving the P&Cs and heads out  more from the crank.

>>  My collection includes splits and bays with upright and  Type IV motors. 
I was thinking about getting rid of the Type IV's until Type 2  list readings 
taught me about the longevity of these motors and how to deal  with the 
dropped valve problem (as you said, avoid overheating, and when  rebuilding, use the 
improved heads).  <<
A major part of our experience and need for more reliable engines with  
better MPG stems from many of the following factors.  So far we have  never made 
$50,000 together in a year.  Plus from having taken a 5  year vacation due to 
personal health problems.  Then just when we were  going to get back to full 
time paying jobs and put in the last bit  of paperwork to adopt.  Barb's dad had 
a massive stoke  on 25DEC98, and we have taken care of him now almost six 
years, with  only Barb's sister to relieve us every other week.  Eric found a full 
 time job about 14 months ago, after looking for over a year.  So to  say 
that our finances got stretched and required being very frugal would  probably be 
an understatement!
