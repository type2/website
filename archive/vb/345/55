Right.  The blue wire is a hot wire that is on whenever the high beams
are on.  This bulb grounds through the outside sleeve of the socket to
the speedometer housing.

You don't strictly have to.  The license light will ground itself
through the lid and hinges back to the body, but it might not be as
bright or steady as it could be.  On my '64, the ground wire is just
a short jumper to a sheet metal screw in the jamb of the engine lid -
it doesn't go into the harness.

Just for grins, have you tried another bulb?  Even a 12 V one will work
for testing purposes.
