Subject: RE: [VB] Broken accelerator cable

Great story, there's some good Karma in these old Buses for sure.  I like
your idea of the old fuel line so it won't cut into the tranny.  The PO on
my Bus had let is slice about 1/2" through the tranny case. I made a small,
aluminum fork that the cable rides through and fabbed a bracket so it mounts
to the tranny, lots of grease, no more slicing.
