I'd have to second the no to GEX.

If I were ordering a block I would opt for hydraulic lifters, would budget 
for an electronic ignition unit, insist on dual relief, and either get an 
bus oil pump with a spin-on filter or get the case drilled for full flow and 
remote mount the filter, either allow the use of the stock exhaust system.

Basically, hydraulic lifters and ignition unit are less maintinance. Oil 
filter and dual relief help with reliability and longetivity.

As far as power, there are many ways of achieving that.  In my opinion, the 
easiest and cheapest would be a Weber progressive carb and extra 40 bucks 
(or so) for 042 or 044 heads.

1776 cc is the reccomended displacement increase for power and 'stock' 
reliability, I have one in my van, and have not been bowled over by the 
diffrence but that is with stock heads.
