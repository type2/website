Subject: Speedo and lic plate light

Boy, are you all quiet. Today I might get back to working on the electrical
harness that we replaced two weeks ago. I had a light bulb and socket missing
at the bright headlight indicator in the rear of the speedo That is a hot
wire, right? I have a color coded diagram from VintageBus, I'll probably have
to look at it or something. For you that don't know everything, I have a '63
Sundial camper.

Also the license plate light burns the fuse. In the diagram there is only one
wire, but when I was cleaning out the old wires there were two. Do I have to
use a ground wire? I cleaned up the recepticle and made sure that the
insulator isolated the bulb wire, but it still blows the fuse.

It is 16 degrees outside here in Arkansas, so I think it is a good day to get
to work in the heated garage.
