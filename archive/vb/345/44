Subject: VDO oil temp gage fluctuation

The VDO oil temp gage w/dipstick sender that has been on my 70 bus for about 
25 years has started fluctuating wildly. The fluctuation varies from almost 
full range to very small oscillations. No fluctuation when the bus is not 
moving.

Anyone else experience and solve this problem?

Phil
