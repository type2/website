It was a pretty original bus when it came to me except for the outside paint
and the huge einstein head and qoute "imagination is more important than
knowledge" It was velvet green front and back. pop top lip looked to be
factory. wood headliner was nice and looked og. column and e brake where
also black. Maybe 67's had it to match the new black rubber knobs?
