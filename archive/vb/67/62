Subject: RE: [VB] BBB photos

Hi Todd,

I am uploading the photos direct from the site using blazing fast 14,400 bps
cell phone modem :)

I just updated the Sunday morning photos:
  http://www.oldVolks.com/Events/BBB/2002Photo/

Next year we are considering doing a 802.11b wireless network.  It is just a
matter if worth the effort (enough interest).  The site is perfect, we could
easily do the whole site with just one base station.  Some of the Buskateers
group was asking about this. (I have 802.11b in my RV, and a number of high
quality antennas that can do several miles if line of sight...)  we just
need to find a Internet tap that would be willing to sponsor the weekend :)

Bring your computer to BBB VII?

  Who is taking the pix of BBB?? Great job! You are 
making it almost bearable being stuck here at work while 
all of you have so much bus fun! 
  How are you getting the pictures uploaded so quickly? 
I'm just sitting here in my BBB V shirt watching stuff 
as it happens...Maybe next year there will even be a 
live feed??  :)
