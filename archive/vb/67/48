Subject: Re: [VB] Westy hitch

  Thanks for the info Matt! 
  This morning I took the DC to a custom hitch shop that 
was recommended by a VW shop owner. $230 installed, not 
including electrical which I will do myself. It will 
bolt to the frame where the bumper bracket are to hold 
the tounge weight and extend up to the main frame 
members farther up by the torsion tube for the pulling.
  The hitch will have a "micro reciever" which I like, a 
tounge capacity of 300# and pulling capacity of 3000# 
(the smallest they make). The most I will be pulling 
will be half that. 
  I'm installing a dual circut MC this weekend (thanks 
to Harry Houck for the resevoir) and the trailer will 
have electric brakes with a controller up front. I'm 
running a strong 1776 with dual carbs and all the 
goodies, so we will see.
  Missed BBB this year but hope to be camping in style 
with this setup next year.
