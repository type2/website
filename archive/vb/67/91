 Remove 3/4 valve cover.
 Turn engine in DIRECTION of rotation.
 Watch #3 valves. You will see the exhaust open then close. Just as the 
exhaust
 closes and the intake just starts to move STOP.
 At the point of rocking, when the exhaust stops closing and the intake starts
 opening, #1 will be at TDC and your crank pulley will be at zero. IF your 
crank
 pulley has a zero mark on it and IF your cam timing is correct. Usually cam
 timing is correct, BUT not all type1 crank pulleys have a zero mark on
 them......

I would make file marks on the crank pulley if there isn't al;ready, make it 
so the mark is on both sides of the fan belt, so to make it clear which  of 
the marks is TDC
