Hi Joel,
That should work.  Might be a little lean for the DP engine, but it does 
sound like you are using the earlier air cleaner which is smaller than what 
was used on the 1971 DP engine and should make it run richer.  You might be 
better off using a 34PICT-3 carb instead.

That is true of all engines unless you crank up the choke!  Personally we 
prefer to use the choke as little as possible.
