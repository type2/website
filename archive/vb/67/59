 i am havng a problem with my '70 bay window, and was wondering if i
 could ask about gas in the oil.....i've been smelling gas recently and i
 changed the oil today...couldn't believe it....what would cause this? 
 even as i was draining the oil, i just watched what appeared to be gas,
 continue to drip out....any thoughts?
 well thank you and i enjoy reading all your posts.
 thanks,

it looks like gas, but is it gas?  does it smell like gas?
gas in oil with really limit the life of the engine, messes up the 
lubrication.  so do make a habit of sniffing the oil (dipstick) occasionally. 
 gas in oil usually makes it look like they is too much oil in the motor as 
the level of fluid is higher.  hope you caught it soon.

pull the fuel pump of and look in the base thing it sits on- gas in there?  
if so the fuel pump is leakin- get a new one, i think they are about $22.
