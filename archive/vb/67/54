the oil today...couldn't believe it....what would cause this?  even as i was

Hi John,
If it the dripping of fuel was continuing to drip out of the sump then it 
sounds like torn/cracked fuel pump diaphram.  If not the diaphram, check fuel 
pump rod hieght.  If the problem does not go away then replace carb shut off 
vavle and/or float which could be too heavy or compromised.   Eric&Barb
