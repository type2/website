Hi there,

I just wanted to introduce myself and see what kind of list and how =
active this list is. My name is Alex Vieira and I've been involved with =
VWs since I was a teenager. I live in Colorado Springs, CO, and am a =
charter member of the Colorado VW Bus Club. I have a '63 Standard and a =
'65 Kombi (people hauler and crap hauler, respectively) and I am =
currently building my first engine for the '63 (it's nerve-wracking the =
first time!). I'm getting back into the scene after taking a couple of =
years off to get out of debt, buy a house, etc., but I'm looking forward =
to participating in some club and local events here in CO. I'm also into =
aircooled BMW twins (affectionately called 'airheads' by those =
in-the-know), and belong to a couple of clubs through that interest as =
well.

So, I guess I should ask right off the bat, are there any subjects that =
generally cause nothing but strife and disagreements on this list, e.g. =
which oil to use, whether to do custom or stock restos, etc.? Every list =
has its own personality and I'm just trying to get a sense for this one. =
I hope everyone's having a fine winter under the busses and I look =
forward to swapping info and ideas!
