Subject: RE: [VB] finding TDC on a your crank pulley

TDC is ALWAYS 90 degrees up (12:00 position) from the keyway slot when the
slot is at 9:00 position. (hold or look at the pulley in front of you, key
slot at the 9:00 position, TDC is at the 12:00 position). 
this is true of all aircooled vw crankshaft pulleys, and irregardless of
where the timing marks are on the pulley, TDC is always at 12:00 when the
slot is at 9:00.
remove the pulley nut if the pulley is on the car, or follow the valve
checking method also mentioned.
if the pulley is off, a square is a very easy way to find tdc.
