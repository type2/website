Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel Tank Swap Smells

Hi Kevin,
If you are getting fuel vapor smell in your cargo compartment you should 
check the sheet metal in front and over the engine for any holes.  Our 1960 
walk thru panel had about six drilled holes in the spare tire wheel well!  
The gas tank cap is vented so you are going to get some gas vapor in the 
engine compartment.  Filling the tank and immeadiately parking the bus is not 
a good idea, especially on highly crowned roads.  Best to plan when you fill 
the tank to take a 20-30 minute drive afterward to prevent gas overflow.  The 
tube on the top of the tank was to go to the fuel condensors in the later bus 
up in the fresh air intake vents area.
