Thanks to all who responded to my post about differences between the
readings on my two VDO head temp gauges.

I followed a list member's suggestion to test the gauges in boiling
water and found that both were reading the same.  Actually, when I
removed the senders, I discovered that the #3 sender's ring had broken
off the sender wire, which resulted in the sender only measuring the air
temp around the top of the spark plug.  Fortunately, Bus Boys lists a
sender available as a stand alone item.

I had also asked about the correct temperature range for a 1600 SP head
temperatures.  Although, I never received any replies to this question,
I'm happy to report that head temps have dropped back into the 230-250
range.  In the absence of any other explanation, I'm assuming that as
the engine (recent rebuild) wears in, internal friction decreases?

Thanks,
