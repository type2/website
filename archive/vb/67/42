Hi Lars,
"Fit" does not sound right.  Do you mean does these R&Ps work with a 1600cc 
engine?  If so, they do.  We are running a 3.875 R&P with .82 fourth in our 
63 SC with big bore 40 HP (1300) engine.  It does work and is faster over 
all. Though it does not climb hills as well as we would like which is why we 
are about to build up a few 1641 SP CW engines.  As always HP and speed needs 
of each driver is a personal choice.  Some volks will not be happy with 
anything less than a 2 liter or even stuffing a V8 into thier bus.   Eric&Barb
