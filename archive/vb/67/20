Hey folks,
Just in case anyone from the OC/North County area is heading out to Havasu 
tomorrow, we've got a small group heading out early tomorrow afternoon.

Me and a couple of SV2s guys will be heading out of Temecula around 1pm.

If anyone else wants to head out with us or meet along the way...p-mail me by 
10am or so.

Later,
Beto
63 EZ--havasu bound!
