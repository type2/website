Subject: BBB photos

  Who is taking the pix of BBB?? Great job! You are 
making it almost bearable being stuck here at work while 
all of you have so much bus fun! 
  How are you getting the pictures uploaded so quickly? 
I'm just sitting here in my BBB V shirt watching stuff 
as it happens...Maybe next year there will even be a 
live feed??  :)
