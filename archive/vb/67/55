Hi folks!  
       
       I used to work at a place in western Mass called Bob's Auto Parts. 
These are real VW people! The senior mechanic, Dan ( I call him Steve) is an 
old school VW factory trained mechanic and really knows what he is doing. He 
can line bore cases, do the valve seats and all that. So if you're in the 
area give a call there at 413-736-3278 and tell them Alan told you to call. 
Also off topic, if anyone in the same area is looking for a decent 62 Kombi 
please write me back..

Alan in Mass
several VWs
