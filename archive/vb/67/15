Subject: Camper windows value??

I have a chance to purchase an entire set of the
westfalia slat-type camper windows.  it is an entire
set, driver and pass. side, used but not broken or
damaged. They are currently in a 64' bus.  I'm not
sure what fair market value is for these windows.  I
want to make sure I'm not paying too much.  Please
reply with any suggestions and/or comments.

Thanks
Matt
