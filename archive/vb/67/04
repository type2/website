The 74 could have the earlier or later steering column...it changed sizes
between early 74 and early 75..not entirely sure when.  The later size is
the same as Rabbit columns, as I recall.  Smaller then the 68-74 size.
(we're talking about beetle/super here) The "1988 Porsche" wheel probably
has the same spline size as the VW Rabbits did...I know that the 924 and
944 did. (since you dont mention a model, and i've never pulled the wheel
off of a 911 or 928 of that era i'll leave that up to speculation.)

IF the 68-74 type1 used the same spline size as the 68-71 bus, then you
could find, if it is made, an adaptor to go from late bug/rabbit > early
bug.  It owuld be a rather odd piece, though, and thin..I dont know that
i'd want to trust it to turn a bus reliabley. (an adaptor sleeve, that is.
which wouldnt change the mounting height. some adaptor styles would change
that.....do you really want to move your wheel up 3-4 inches?)

Ug.  That would be really dangerous..not to mention rather hard to get
lined up straight/correct length...



The later bus..whenever they changed the column style (74?) got a
different spline size also...i think it is smaller, but probably not small
enough for your needs. (with some work you should be able to interchange a
later column/box..)


your best bet, and probably easiest, is to take the wheel to a machine
shop and ask them to open it up to fit.  Take the bus, too. Might not be
cheap, though.


I'll refrain from asking why you'd put something as ugly as an 80's
porsche steering wheel on a bus, though...
