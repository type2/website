Thanks, Matt!

You're right, admitting I have a problem is the first step.... hehe...

Tell your friend that the only way a 1970s R100 can hit 140 is by driving
off a pretty high cliff; they were only ever rated at about 127 mph. Of
course, I only know this from literature.... And it's blank, but still
pretty cool looking with the "S" fairing.

BTW, I've had the Bentley's for a few years, it's pretty damn handy. Any
comments from anyone re: usefulness of VW parts manuals CDs I've seen on
ebay? It says that it has a few different manuals plus ads, wiring diagrams,
brochures, etc. Thanks for the tips on checking in while on the road and
color diagrams on the web; I wasn't aware of those. See, I'm learning stuff
already!!
