While an Anhangevorrichtung may well be an "appendix device", that's
not what Thom has.  It's an Anh=E4ngevorrichtung, which Babelfish translate=
s
as "towing bracket".  Those funny little marks are important!  Some of
the online translators provide "pop up" foreign keyboards.  Or, you=20
can use the following translations (at least on Babelfish):

Funny capital B (Beta) - type two 's'
gro=DF -> gross

Vowel with two dots over it (umlaut or diaeresis) - type the normal vowel=
=20
  and follow it with an 'e'
St=FCckliste -> Stueckliste

So, Thom's hitch tag reads:
(ORIS logo)  Anh=E4ngevorrichtung  1000 S u. 1004
Hersteller: Srobach, D=F6rge u. Co., oHG, Stuttgart
Typ: Oris D 28  Pr=FCfz.: (caterpillar) M 3349  Baujahr: 1964
Zul=E4ssiges Gesamtgewicht d. Kfz.: 1100 kg
Gepr=FCft f=FCr 600 Kg Anh=E4ngelast
F=FCr Kraftfahrzeuge gem=E4=DF bes. Anbauanweisung
Vertrieb: Otto Riehle, Stuttgart

Punching this into babelfish.altavista.com with the above substitutions
yields:
(ORIS logo)  towing bracket  1000 S and 1004=20
manufacturers: Srobach, Doerge and CO, oHG, Stuttgart
type: Oris D 28  Pruefz.: (caterpillar) M 3349  year of construction: 1964
admissible total weight d. Kfz.: 1100 kg
checked for 600 kg of trailer weight
for motor vehicles in accordance with bes. Cultivation statement
selling: Petrol Riehle, Stuttgart=20

And I would clean this up to:
(ORIS logo)  Towing bracket  1000 S and 1004=20
Manufacturers: Srobach, Doerge and Co., oHG, Stuttgart
Type: Oris D 28  Test mark: (caterpillar) M 3349  Built: 1964
Admissible total weight of vehicle: 1100 kg
Tested for 600 kg of trailer weight
For motor vehicles in accordance with installation instructions
Seller: Otto Riehle, Stuttgart=20

Line by line:
>(ORIS logo)  Towing bracket  1000 S and 1004=20
Pretty simple.  I'm not sure what the numbers refer to, though.
=20
>Manufacturers: Srobach, Doerge and Co., oHG, Stuttgart
Again, pretty simple.  oHG is _probably_ an abbreviation for
the name of a village/neighborhood around Stuttgart, but it
could also be something like "incorporated".

>Type: Oris D 28  Test mark: (caterpillar) M 3349  Built: 1964
The model number, certification, and build date.  That "caterpillar"
sign is an older EU acceptance mark - kind of like the encircled E
you will see on the light lenses on new cars.  A similar marking on
a U.S. part might be "DOT" or "Meets FMVSS".
 =20
>Admissible total weight of vehicle: 1100 kg
I think this means "not to be installed on vehicles heavier than this."
It _could_ also mean "total weight of vehicle and trailer."  I am
assuming that the Kfz. means "Kraftfahrzug" or "motor vehicle".

>Tested for 600 kg of trailer weight
Here's the trailer weight, a little over 1300 pounds as you noted.

>For motor vehicles in accordance with installation instructions
The "installation instructions" is the part of this translation I'm
least happy with.  It could instead say something like "applicable
regulations".  The "statement" part makes some sense but "Anbau",
which Babelfish translates as "cultivation" has me stumped.=20

>Seller: Otto Riehle, Stuttgart
And this is the place that sold it.

I used these two online sources:=20
Babelfish     http://babelfish.altavista.com/
EuroDicAutom  http://europa.eu.int/eurodicautom/login.jsp

I haven't had any formal classes in German.  All of this comes from
online translators, studying German phrase books and a couple of German
VW books, and hanging out around my sister who has a degree in German.

<disclaimer>
What I'm trying to say is that I'm not an expert in German and that
towing something with your Bus is a potentially dangerous activity,
so you have to decide for yourself what kind of hitch you need and
how safe it is.=20

I hope this helps!
