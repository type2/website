hi group.
I have been reading the posts for about a month now.  I was lucky enough
to find a '56 double door panel van and am now in the tearing down
stage.  i have been filing all your thoughts and messages so that as my
problems come up, i have answers.
i am havng a problem with my '70 bay window, and was wondering if i
could ask about gas in the oil.....i've been smelling gas recently and i
changed the oil today...couldn't believe it....what would cause this? 
even as i was draining the oil, i just watched what appeared to be gas,
continue to drip out....any thoughts?
well thank you and i enjoy reading all your posts.
thanks,
