Hi All
I wanted to take a moment and thank everyone who took the time to respond to 
my question regarding Bus restoration books.Your kindness is appreciated. 
So...Thank you!
Now I need to decide whether to do a traditional restoration, close to 
original as I can get, or do something wild and crazy. Part of me has always 
wanted to do my bus up like a 60's inspired Art mobile......I have a friend 
who is an airbrush expert........HHmmmm......but I love original busses, too. 
Guess I need more than one, huh? Tee hee hee....
That campout looked like alot of fun. I'm going to make an effort to go to 
the next Bus thing that I hear about on this list.
So..thanks again.....Alice
