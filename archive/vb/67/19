OK,

The REAL reason I ask this is 'cuz I have two gray ones. One has cracks 
and needs a resto (the finish and composition is nice, just the normal 
amount of cracks). The other one is close to show quality - original non 
resto, but one (very small) chip and marks that will probably clean up 
once I get on it.

But, from the responses it sounds like my 65 Deluxe came with pearl 
white (ivory). And that's what I'll shoot for. Thanks very much for your 
responses.

Thanks,
Conrad
