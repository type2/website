Yes, 4.125 was one of the ratios stock available for a splitty
3.875 can be put in the tranny with some modifications

so they would fit the regular tunnel case swing axle trans that your 36 hp, 
40hp, 1500, 1600, or bored out fat motor or probably even a pancake motor 
will bolt up to it just fine.
if you have a tranny that does 3K at 50mph and you drive it as fast as you 
can just to 'keep up with traffic'  it will stress the motor.  if you swap 
the tranny for a higher geared one, the engine won't have to go as fast.  I 
seem to remember a post a while back that your (Lars)'s bus ran really hot in 
the summer at 60mph, gearing may be why.  engine cools best at 2600-2800 
rpms, so that is best speed to drive on really hot days, but cools better at 
3K than 3500. 

I think a 3.88 w/ 1.26 is too high if you have a loaded camper, unless you 
use a larger than 1600cc motor, but hear it is fine for those with light 
(unladen) buses.  
I really like the 4.37/1.26/ with 205/75/r15 tires &1600 sp on my 61- thats 
the early 64 gearing.

If you dont want to hassle with changing out a functional tranny,  ( like 
Bob, who has kept his low geared tranny for years) you can find 15" rims and 
205/75 15 tires to make the effective gearing higher if you are using smaller 
tires now.  I was thinking that the euro 195 15 would be slightly taller, but 
I haven't searched yet.   The current fashion for tires seems to be wide and 
short, not tall and narrow. oh- no boring tire thread

 Would a 4.125 or a 3.875 fit a standard 1600 ccm with reduction boxes ?
