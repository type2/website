Subject: RE:transporter restoration books

Some one asked about books about restoring buses, and
the one that I have is:
"VW Beetle & Transporter Restoration Manual"   by
Lindsey Porter
This is a British (English?) book, and includes split
and loaf buses and beetles, but has good pics and
other info that you may not otherwise find.  Got my
copy for $20 or so at a car show a  few years ago, and
before that I used one at the local library.  I think
list price is $34.95.
Here it is at Amazon:

I looked at reviews of someother books on
"restoration" of VWs, and this one gets much better
reviews--I agree.

Jim, in Wis,
who used this book as one of the references in 
restoring my 65 double cab , along with Bentley
