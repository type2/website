Subject: Changing axle boots

One of the tasks ahead for getting my single cab back on the road is
replacing the axle boots.  I'd like to get the axles level when doing this
and would like to know how to use the chain and jack method to keep the
vehicle in place while setting the axle to the correct height.

Thanks,

Thomas
