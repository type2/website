There are plenty of things that Westy drivers could do for this event...

* Print up some Kennedy, Humphrey, Wallace, McGovern, or Hospers
  bumper stickers, and put them on your Buses beforehand.

* Get some of those vinyl/magnetic signs made up for all the Buses.
  They could advertise businesses, like "the Plumbers".

* Get everyone driving a Bus to show up in black suits, white shirt, 
  tie, sunglasses.  Put an old transistor-radio earpiece in your ear
  and talk into your suit sleeve a lot.

* Bring your cell phone to the event.  If someone calls you, answer
  it with "F(-at-)ck Hoover. Hello."

* There will probably be a lot of waiting around involved.  Bring some
  reading material, like http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671894412 .
