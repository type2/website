yup, that is a reeal hard one.  I have only found two buses with that 
interior.  One was a 58 15 window, it had a few pieces of it left.  But I 
didn't buy that 58. The other was a 56 23 window- a wolfsberg bus in fact.  
It has an entire complete interior including the 6-legged middle seat 
(Wolfberg bus).  And two yellowjackets nest.  ow.

ya- real hard to find that stuff.
