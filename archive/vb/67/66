With the 1300cc and 1641cc engine we prefer to keep the RPMs down to 3,000 
for much better MPG, and longer engine longevity due to cooler running 
engines.  This results in a cruising speed in fourth gear of 58MPH with the 
same sized tires on both axles and the 3.875 R&P.  We can get up to 70MPH 
easily with the 1641cc, but have not tried this with the 1300cc engine due to 
it not being counterwieghted.  On the flats it should be able to do 70 MPH.  
Once you are used to a CW engine a stocker cranked engine is very annoying 
with it's vibration and resultant noise.  Both of which robs the engine of HP 
going to the wheels!

 What does R&P mean, is't differantiale gearing ? >>

R&P is the ring and pinion.  Both of these parts is what makes up the 
differential.
