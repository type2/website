Thom,

I've done the timing to 32 degrees, and the compressions look good. I'm
gonna have to just see what happens rest of today's activities, and I'll
be back on tomorrow, assuming it makes it thru tonight!

Tomorrow I'll be at my friends workshop/home, and have more time and
space.

Thanks so far for all the suggestions - tomorrow I'll have the options of
checking the lower head bolts torque.
