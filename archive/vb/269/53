Subject: new wheel cylinder problem

Hi all, I bought a new front wheel cylinder last week and installed it
this weekend, but the hard line going into the cylinder is leaking. It
looks like the nut is bottomed out on the cylinder, but the line still
seems to be a little loose. Is the hole drilled a little deeper on the
new cylinders, or do I have a problem with my hard line being buggered
up?

This is on a '57 kombi with stock hardware.

Also, I'm trying to replace the clutch cable, and I can't seem to get
it the list 1.5ft or so, seems it's hanging up on the bowden tube. I
tried to remove the tube, but it seems the mount on the tranny is part
of the side plate. Will the tube slide out of the mount with a little
force? Or any other ideas on how to get that thing installed?

Thanks!!
