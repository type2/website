Diane's second repair shop is "Scooter" :)
The authorized VW Dealer Inspection should have included
a cost estimate for the repair of an oil leak, since that's why she
went there and now plans to return for. They do repair old vw's.
It is unclear if the leak is a rear (?) main seal or a cracked
case so the estimate will be very different for each of these.

They refused to provide documentation for brake defects and
steering defects, and substituted rusty muffler, and was told
that the $75/hour charge ( which took 30 minutes ) would have
to be applied separately for each individual problem.
Pretty expensive estimate.
We think that she can get estimates for each of these extra problems
from Midas muffler, brake shops, alignment shops, etc. for free.

The registered letter is a very good idea, but she has no confidence
in the original shop and no way to police another shoddy repair scam there.

She has not yet explored the Better Business Bureau,
The Department of Motor Vehicles ( it's a registered repair shop )
or the Attorney General. And she bought the bus on Ebay.
The repairs may well exceed the limits of small claims court.
