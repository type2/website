Subject: A trip to the mechanics from hell in the AM

Going to make a quick trip to the mechanics from hell in the morning.
Nothing really matters now, going to take a trip to the court house as
soon as my suspicions are confirmed.  To make a long story short.

Got the engine compartment opened this afternoon and I am 99.9%
sure that NOTHING was done to my engine.  No rebuild, no new case.
My engine when I dropped it off had a fine layer of dust from the primer
.. the welding .. the body work that was done on the rear end.  When I
got the lid opened today, I see that the dust is still all over the engine
compartment.  Everything covered in a thin layer of "whatever it is."

There is no way they could have taken that engine out, moved everything
to a new case and put it back in, with the same dust all over the place.
These guys are pigs, but some of it .. if not all .. should have been
removed.

Taking it on Friday to someone who is going to take a good look at the case.
I don't know what I am looking for . .but he will see if a crack has been
repaired
or if the case has been replaced.  Haven't found the paper yet, but somewhere
I have the case number written down.  Just can't find it or remember where I
put
that damn number.  I didn't take any pictures.  I was just to sick, I closed
the lid
and took a bubble bath.
