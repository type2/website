Subject: RE: [VB] VW Authorized Dealership Inspection

Well, you got somewhere. Smell the oil from the leak at the trans/case area.
If it is really thick and has a sulfery sweet smell, it's trans oil.
Otherwise it's engine oil from the main seal. I'd also grab the stationary
crank pully and see if it has excessive forward back play, a poor test for
excessive endplay.
The snubbers are an easy DIY install, call a good vendor from a pair. Takes
10mins. No tools.

Just got back from the VW Authorized Dealership Inspection.  Didn't go as
well as I hoped.  The person who made my appointment said "yes you can" to
so many things, pictures etc .. Dropped off my bus .. she filled out the
paperwork .. then the service manager called me into his office .. closed
the door and said "I smell a law suit and VW does not want to get involved."
In any case .. NO .. I could not go in and take pictures of the bus when it
is on the lift. They did an inspection and here is what they wrote.

FLUID LEAK ENGINE

Customer states that she had her engine re-built and after having the engine
re-built she noticed engine oil leak.  The aftermarket shop said they
replaced the case.  Customer has concern about the after market shop doing
what they said they did.  Please advise.

Tech found a small leak detected at the case half where it meets with
transmission.  Small leak detected from overflow tube.

That was ALL .. There were also some notes not on here, that I was not
allowed to photo copy and it would not fit into the space given for her to
type on my invoice.

I jotted it down.

Something about rust near the steering box ....
and rear axel snubbers are gone.
