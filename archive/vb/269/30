No one aligned anything, they just jury-rigged the steering wheel's
position to make it look better. If you live in Orlando, there are several
bus owners listed on the AIRS list site. You might email them and ask
if they could recommend some mechanics who actually *fix* VWs, rather than
ones who *work* on them.

You need to get your bus back from this shop before they install a "brace"
or whatever. If you don't, then there's simply no hope for you to get
things proper with your bus, in my opinion. Sorry to have to say this, but
everything that you have been describing as far as what these guys have
done and are doing to your bus, is bullsh&t. Your bus is getting ruined,
and they are soaking you for the charges.

Do some research, park the bus, and find proper personnel to work on your
bus. Go to the AIRS site and find someone local to ask for advice. And buy
the Muir book, as Clara and others have suggested several times.
