  Price shouldn't really be a consideration on a restored bus, as long as
the quality of the resto warrants the price. The SC for 10 K seems very fair
if the quality of the resto warrants that price. Looking at the pics brought
up some questions in my mind as to that bus and the price. If you look at
the pic from the passenger side you will notice some FUNNY behind the seat,
hummmm. If it has some funny there then where else might there be some.
   I bought back my 1959/60 SC from the person I sold it to years previous
after he had spent close to 11,000 dollars on it and it still doesn't have
paint, but it does have a rebuilt OG trans (show quality) installed, front
end totally rebuilt (new king pins, link pins, bearings, etc), rebuilt
steering box, KOCH wheel, all the brakes done, wheels and new tires,
underside all done and painted. Rebuilt 40 hp using all NOS parts and made
to look like original Basterd with correct dizzy, fuel pump, tin, etc. WCC
reupholstered seat, all new panels, Corona Ryan restored speedo. NOS tail
lights and headlight assemblies, bumpers stripped and straightened (original
truck rear bumper). Most of the body work done (this was an absolute RUST
FREE and very straight bus to begin with) SC when it was sold. The cheapest
estimate for paint was 5000 to finish and then reassembly and rubber on top
of that. So this SC finished will have over 16,000 dollars invested to bring
back to original condition. Makes the one for 9500 look like a real
deal!!!!!
  On the other hand my 1960 DC will have a lot more into it then the SC. I
could almost buy the SC for what the body and paint is costing alone, you
can see pics of it and it's progress on The Samba in the gallery.
  So what it boils down to is what is a bus really worth when done? Whatever
someone would be willing to pay for it!

>I haven't seen this one but I saw a mid-sixtys double cab in similar
condition
at a local show in GA that a guy was asking $25,000 for. I think he ended-up
selling it for $18,000. Are mid-sixtys double cabs in more demand that mid-
fiftys single cabs?

Yes, Double Cabs are usually more in demand, although I would say a 59-61
DC would be more desirable than a mid-60s DC.

Assuming he actually sold it for that, $18,000 seems VERY high to me.  It
was either perfect or it was an uninformed buyer.

Here's one for $14,500:

I would pay somewhere in that range for a mint '52 Single Cab, assuming
it also had a mint or NOS tilt.  Email me if you have one.  Thanks.
