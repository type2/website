Okay gang,

The morning report on the engine is:

#3 exhaust still set at .008 after yesterdays wanderings, about 50 miles
thru LA traffic at temperature. Strangely enough, the oil pressure guage
isn't vibrating hardly at all at idle.

I checked the new carb against the old carb, and the new carbs main is
127.5 so I left it. The air correction tube/jet had a number, possibly
'802' on it, and I replaced it with the '757' one from my old German carb.
Also replaced that other jet on the other side of the body, the one with
the little ball inside the center on the outside, with the one from the
German unit. I turned the volume screw out 1/8 turn, and reset timing to
30 from 32 yesterday.

I'm leaving Topanga now for Vintage Parts in Glendale, then over to
visiting friends in North Hills (the valley by the 405). I'll do an oil
change there today, and tomorrow check the #3 valve again. Then it's up to
SF, one way or the other, via 101, the middle road - cooler weather. I
figure if I chicken out, I'll disable #3, if things look good, I'll nurse
it up on all four. As VeeWee said, it's surely the new
carb/timing/overheating issue. This engine took me coast to coast twice
this year, with no problems. More soon!
