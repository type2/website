how many miles on this engine?  i.e. when (if ever) have you seen that 
much of a change in any of the valves?

how frequently do you do your valves?

your new carb could be running lean and you could have just run that 
cylinder hot...

Hrm.  Did you do the Ring/Valve check?  (rev to ~2800 rpm, hold there for 
a minute or two, then let off and listen for the telltale rattlesnake 
sound)?

Are your rocker arms torque'd to spec and all the washers intact?
