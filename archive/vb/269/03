Subject: RE: [VB] What the son said [67 rebuild - cracked case]

This has me highly suspect of the rearmost engine mounts, which do interact
with a metal piece that could be interpreted as a brace I guess.
Easy to inspect with the engine out, even I would spot bad ones, especially
ones that could allow an an engine to shift around.

I think this 'flexing' really means swinging all over the place by the
extremely poor or even a missing? Mount, which cracked? The case... I'm
betting on upper driver side case half right near the mounting hole.

Hopefulyl for what they seem to lack in precision and dillegence they'll
compensate for with repeated efforts...

I still agree and resort to the 'run away' approach, ASAP.

or maybe the clunking noise
 I heard everytime I shifted - that sounded like the engine banging around
in
 the back of the bus - was the reason for the crack.  So the case is going
to
 be replaced - their cost - but what about the banging in the engine
 compartment, I wanted to know.
