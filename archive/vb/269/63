don't discount a loose head as the cause for this.  then again, i've never 
had a valve go.  

That said, what does diabling the cylinder buy you over run on a cylinder 
with a bad valve seat?  Dropping the seat isn't going to cause any metal 
to enter the engine, is it?  Once you drop the seat, isn't that just going 
to burn your valve, keep you from having any compression, and keep that 
cylinder from firing anyway?  Just curious...
