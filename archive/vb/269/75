Hi Clara!

The temp hit about 220 for about 15 minutes on the 405 down near Torrence,
then backed off to 210 and then 200. The temp along the 5 thru the San
Jaquin valley to the Grapevine was an even 200 at 60 mph, 3100 rpm, and
outside temp of about 97. Went up to about 215-220 for a while up the
grapevine doing 37 in third (freeway flyer tranny).

I'm planning to change the oil as well tomorrow. Good call Clara! ;-)

Also remove and check size of main jet on recently installed carb.
