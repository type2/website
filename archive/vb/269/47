I think some guys get one look at the Barrett-Jackson Classic Car 
Auction website, see that occassional $28K sunroof deluxe bus, and they 
get delusions of grandeur.  (Has anyone here ever met someone who paid 
$28K for their bus?  Were you gracious, or did you laugh and point?)

I wish I had a dime for every time I've seen one of these ads that said 
"have to sell, [pick one] (1) baby on the way, or (2) need down payment 
for mortgage".  If you're going to jack up your price beyond fair market 
value, at least be a mensch and don't whine about it.  B^)

This 67 DC sounds comparable to mine; I didn't pay anywhere near $14500 
for it in 1998.  The 'Old Cars Price Guide' says the ballpark value 
should be around $15600 in 'trailer queen' condition, or $10920 in 
'superior resto/excellent original' condition.  Then down to $6240 for a 
'older resto showing wear/operable original'.
