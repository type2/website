2 problems here though Matthew.

1)  I do not EVER want him or his son touching my car again.  They lied to
me 2 times that I can prove.  I don't care any longer about their warranty,
what good is it if they fix the job with chewing gum .. not worth the paper
it is written on.
2)  The last time that he "thought" I threatened to take my car somewhere
else he screamed and yelled at the top of his lungs until I left there
shaking.  I had **asked** if he would be insulted if I took my car someplace
else, because I couldn't steer the car and he couldn't find the time to
repair it.  He scares the SH*T out of me.  I never know when he will be
DrJeckyl or MrHyde ...

His [worthless] warranty states "void if worked on by someone else and void
if I run the bus hot or out of oil."
1)  Can't see the lights because the steering wheel is 90 degrees off ..have
to lean to the right and look around it to see the speedometer.
2)  I asked him twice now to install a sensor for heat.  I had one on my 71
bus.
    a)  Both times he said "no, you don't need it.  it is unreliable..."
b)  In days gone by, he did a tune and valve adjustment on my 71 bus ..he
disconnected the gauge.  I said "my gauge is not working since you tuned
it . ."  He said, "you don't need it .. they don't work."  I said "I don't
care, I want it hooked up."  He always ignored my request to re-connect it.
3)  Can't open the hood any more without applying pressure to my bumper .
.he said "check oil DAILY."  I said "I shouldn't have to if you fixed the
case from leaking."  He said "check it daily to be sure you don't run out of
oil."  PERIOD.
