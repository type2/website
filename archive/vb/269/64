I've got a degreed pulley, and a timing light onboard, so I'll do a timing
check over speed.

I've got a compression tester guage onboard, so I'll do a real one as

This whole thing has just hit at the wrong time so I've jumped at what I
think it the serious problem, the 4 mils lost on the #3 exhaust. I'll see
if I can get out to do compression right now, and be back soon.

Thanks all so far...!
