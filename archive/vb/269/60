  Sounds like the same problem JP had on the way to Colorado. After changing
every removable part the bus would still run the same. Finally changed out
the dizzy with the petronix in it and bus ran like a champ after that. After
all the work it turned out the electronic ignition had started to take a
dump. So try a new dizzy with points and see if it makes a difference.

Listees,

Cal here... I'm in LA right now, and my engine's developed a problem.
Description follows. Basically, I need to get back to the Bay Area Wed
evening as planned, after business here is done that morning, but if
absolutely necessary, I could do serious work at a friends workshop/home
for several days with the aim of getting me back Sunday  night for work
Monday. Okay here's the symptoms and problem:

Left Cupertino Sat morning for Sandy Eggo, and around LA the engine
started sounding a bit gravelly, not a mechanical sound, more the exhaust
tone changed from smooth to gravelly. Symptoms:

1) when idling, the oil pressure guage vibrates, down at 20psi (normal
pressure for hot idling in LA - pressure is 45-50 at driving speed).

2) I checked the valves this morning and #3 exhaust has tightened up to
.0045". I normally keep Exhaust valves at .008. All other valves
including #3 intake are all normal (.006 Intake, .008 exhaust). I
readjusted the valve to .008.

3) When the bus is pushing the engine, ie, slowing down in a gear or going
downhill, it knocks (pings) or backfires, don't know which, alot, in any
gear. Sounds like metalic sharp pings, prolly backfiring.

So, backfiring in coast, tight #3 exhaust, and rough sounding at speed.

It sounds fine idling, and has full power, has been running 195-210F thru
hot weather here, and oil pressure has been, when hot, 45-50 running, 20
when idling.

Questions:

Can I disable the cylinder, ie, remove plug, pushrods, and get back (600
mi) to the Bay area reliably on 3 cylinders?

Do I need to devote thursday - sunday to pulling engine and slapping on a
new head, which wont be matched to the hemi'd Rimco head?

Should I take 101 back up (20 degrees cooler, 2 extra hours), rather than
the I-5 thru the hot valley?

Engine is 34pict, DP, 90.2 cylinders, 043 heads with less than 20K from
Rimco last year, long reach plugs. New 34PICT installed last month.
electronic ignition, Crane XR700 - no points. Timing apparently fine.

Help! I'll check back later.
