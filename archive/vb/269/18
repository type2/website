Subject: Re: [VB] '56 Single Cab

The one I saw was a pro resto. The guy bought it and sent it to CA to have
it restored. He said he paid 20K for the resto. He flew out to CA and drove
it back to GA. It sold to a antique car dealer in GA (for the 18K figure, I
think). I saw it recently in an ad by the dealer that was listing it for
sale for 20K. I don't think it even had the canvas top or the wood slats in
the bed..

>I haven't seen this one but I saw a mid-sixtys double cab in similar
condition
at a local show in GA that a guy was asking $25,000 for. I think he ended-up
selling it for $18,000. Are mid-sixtys double cabs in more demand that mid-
fiftys single cabs?

Yes, Double Cabs are usually more in demand, although I would say a 59-61
DC would be more desirable than a mid-60s DC.

Assuming he actually sold it for that, $18,000 seems VERY high to me.  It
was either perfect or it was an uninformed buyer.

Here's one for $14,500:

I would pay somewhere in that range for a mint '52 Single Cab, assuming
it also had a mint or NOS tilt.  Email me if you have one.  Thanks.
