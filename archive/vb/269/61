Ronnie,

My #3 exhaust has lost 4mils from .008. I'm afraid it's a valve seat
getting ready to go to lunch. The E-ignition is working fine.

I'm wondering if the new carb I installed recently is jetted wrong for the
engine. It's a stock 34PICT brasil. The one that's been in there was a
German Solex that I kept running for 10 years, with 127.5 main jet. It's
leaking around the butterfly bushings badly now, so I replaced it. The
engine was doing regular temps and pressure all the way down.

I'm wondering if I can disable the cylinder without damaging the engine
for six hundred miles.
