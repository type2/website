$9500. or $10k and "worth" are all subjective.

Looks very nice to me and compared to what has been on the market in general
this year I would defend it with your dollars being spent and negotiate like
the devil if it were my dollars. (no, duh, eh?)
Time, effort, finished product done right with no rust or short cuts,
mechanicals done to spec? Pfft! For the right person I'd say nab it.
OG paint and one owner written up in the magazines with in the past five years
with tilt and OG canvas? YEAH! I'd say very well worth it.
Hungry kids, quadriplegic wife and you just got laid off while attending both
your parents funerals following your convalescence in rehab? Probably not.

For me a '57 rat single cab was one of my favorite all time VWs. Have no idea
who the seller is but hey, give him/her a break and simply call it a very well
done 'cab. Props to everyone~ especially in this economy.
Are you better off than you were four years ago... hahahah didn't think so.
