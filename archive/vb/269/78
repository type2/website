Yeah, that's what I've been suspecting from the beginning. I've got a
bunch of checks tomorrow, but ultimately, that 4 mils recession plus the
symptoms have me thinking to pull the plug and pushrods, leave the piston
in there. That would turn off the cylinder, and leave the possibly failing
valve motionless. I drove 200 miles in 86 back home to OKC on 3 cylinders
like that once, made it back just fine, and was able to work on the engine
at home. Have you ever had any experience or suggestions regarding the
above bandaid? That's my real question to the list, though the
list's suggestions have been a great reminder of things to check as well.
