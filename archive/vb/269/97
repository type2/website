Subject: RE: [VB] oil change ?

The lack of a drain plug is fairly common. I have a stack of plates that have
no drain plug. Years a go I ordered a bunch of drain plugs and when I need a
plate and have none available with a plug, I just drill and tap one of the
blanks I have. I will have to look at the drill and tap size, I keep all of it
together in one drawer!

I went to do the oil change thing on my 58' espresso bus and noticed
something
a bit odd.  The engine is a type 1 that I believe is a '74.  There is no
drain
plug.  The plate on the bottom of the case is solid, no place for a drain
plug.  Any ideas?  Am I missing something here?
