Subject: RE: [VB] So basically ..

Exactly. It happens like this sometimes. It's happened to me, but it's
starting to get better, so it will for you also.

Do you have space and time to work on it your self? The tool set is not too
extensive, although assistance with an engine pull is good to have.
I think it is likely that your bus desperately needs mounts for the
transmission, and if your block is crack near a mounting point, you might be
able to repair the condition that contributed to this and even ride on the
mill if you must. Can you see the crack to photograph?

IF you cannot work on this yourself, a reputable and compentant shop, which
may not even be a self proclaimed "VW" shop, must remove the engine, nudge
or remove the trans, and replace all those mounts. AN engine 'flopping'
around must indicate something is terribly awry in this area.
Since you could shift, I suspect the rear most mounts to be most suspect.
This can strain the heck outta the front, so I'd do/have that done also if
it isn't recent. Removing a trans usually requires a hand also, so have help
if you go this far, and a Bentley.

With parts available a good shop can take care of that in one solid day. I'm
rooting for you about the engine, I hope you can at least use it a while.
With work your bus isn;t doomed, especially if the case isn't totally
fuxored, but a crack of any kind is not fun..

So basically what everyone is saying is that my bus is doomed.  I have spent
all my money on this beast and trade away my 71.  Maybe if I buy some
insurance and the bus has an accident I can recover my loss.  But
seriously -
if it is as bad as I think it must be, there is NO WAY I would sell it to
someone else.  Just suck it up and take the loss.
