diane,
was it ever verified that the sound you heard was the engine flopping around
back there or are you using your imagination based on the noises you hear.
if a couple of your spring plate bolts are loose it could sound like your
engine or tranny flopping around back there when you shift.  ive missed a
lot of this thread so i may be way off.  i check those on every new bus i
get and they always seem to be loose.
