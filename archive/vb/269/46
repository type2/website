It's called A.I.R.S.( Aircooled Interstate Rescue Squad ).
Be sure to put your info up there, you already have
valuable information of where an unwary traveler

You do not have to be a mechanic to participate.

You need a larger list. Search for swap meets
in your area. Many more and better mechanics
will turn up there who are basically off the grid.

After finishing the cover on the Idiot book,
open it up and read some more :)

Photos. We want photos.
