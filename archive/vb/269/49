Paint. Your bus loves paint :)
Paint is a whole new set of tools.
Start small. Remove and Refinish one door.
Put one of your spares on the driver bus
while you are doing the work so you don't have to rush it.
Just like mechanical repairs, the  procedures
improve with experience. Use quality materials.
Your paint supplier is a wealth of information.
When you supply the labor, paint is cheap. Sorta :)
