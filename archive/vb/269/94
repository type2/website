Well, if you think about it, what you did is exactly what I recommended that
she do. You notified the 1st mechanic that you wanted them to fix it, they
refused and you then sold it to a person that fixed it himself. The only thing
missing in your case is the fact that you did not have invoices from the 2nd
mechanic. The judge would not expect you to provide these because the new
owner fixed the problem himself.

To support your case, it would have been best for you to have the new owner in
court to testify that he fixed the problem himself but the judge apparently
weighed the evidence and the balance tipped your way. Good for you.

I just want her to know that the judge will _most likely_ want some proof that
a problem still existed after the 1st mechanic worked on the car and that she
had to pay (or, in your case, someone else had to pay) to have it fixed.

I then sold the van (to a friend/mechanic) who fixed the air with a 10 dollar
part in 5 minutes!!!!!
