If a valve gets damaged and the head of the valve breaks away from the
stem, it'll destroy the piston, allowing the conn rod to run loose in the
cylinder - I've had it happen at least once in the old days. The receding
valve seat symptom is a sign of something wrong, possibly overheating of
that cylinder, which could lead to the above.
OKAY:
ran compression on #3 and #4 for comparison:

#3 is 130 with NO leak-down.

#4 is 127 with no leak-down.

They both look normal, which is wierd considering all symptoms.

My timing at full advance is 27 degrees, using a good quality KAL Advance
timing light, with low hours of use. I think it should be at 30, I'll set
it at 30 - any opinions are welcome here.

As I've stated before , my main concern is that loss of 4 mils (seat
recession on #3 exhaust), on #3 exhaust.

Back to you, and any others!

thanks,
cal
