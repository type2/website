Hi Cal,
Check all three or more jets!  Checking the main only shows what fuel is 
getting into the engine at lower to midddlish RPMs.  The air correction jet is 
suposed to lean out the mixture from getting too lean at higher RPMS!!!
  The more we think about it the more we feel your problem is either carb or 
ignition related.  With your tight valve being a symptom not the cause of your 
trouble.
  From the shop manual Section K-2, page 21:  Banging in exhaust when vehicle 
is over running the engine.  a- idling mixture slightly weak. a- enrich 
mixture by turning the volume control screw approxiately 1/8 of a turn.
