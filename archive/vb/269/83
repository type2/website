So perhaps I should replace the air correction jet with the old carb's as
well as the main.

I agree. I'm gonna do an oil change as well, and enrich the mix using the
volume control as you've suggested. I'd throw the old carb back in, but I
believe it's a fire hazard, as fuel was dripping out both sides of the
butterfly axle when the engine died last month. So, new carb - and
probably bad mixture. I've got 60 or so miles to go today in LA, and will
check the valve this morning before heading out, and also tomorrow
morning.

Thanks again!
