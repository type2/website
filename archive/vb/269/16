Hmmmmmm.  I was thinking more in comparison to DC's, Tippers, DD panels,
sideloaders, cherry pickers etc.  It seems to moi that ratty SC's while
possibly being desirable, don't sell for much, thus the bottom of the chain
comment.
I think the general public that barely knows that SCs or DCs even exist in
relation to a bus that someone did "a nice job of turning into a truck
thing" will pay more for a SC/DC than the "educated" or "informed" VW
afficionado.
