Yeah, I figure that's the case, but I've never bought cheap tools. Most of
my oldest tools (all still functioning) are Craftsman, and they're just
fine. I have some Allen brand wrenches which are really nice, and the rest
are Proto, and other good things I've come across, but no cheap stuff. All my
tools have always 'just worked', everytime. I had a really neat Sears
Craftsman drill for 20 years, but it finally bit the dust, and I bought a
US made DeWalt, back in 95.

When I'm working on the bus, and I reach for a tool, I know exactly what
it does in the situation, and that's a good feeling, considering I've
done everything at least once on this thing, most things many times, and
the tools have always worked.

Tool rant off, someday I'll stop the truck! hehe!
