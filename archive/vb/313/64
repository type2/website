Volks,

Yesterday my '65 was used in a photoshoot for a company called Pelco in Clovis, CA. for a brochure of their products.

Their idea was to illustrate merging old and new technologies.  They parked my bus and a brand new BMW 5-series out on a country road with fake california license plates that said "digital" and "analog".

Two models were used, one yuppie-guy with the Bimmer and a (you guessed it) Jerry Garcia looking guy with my bus.  They stared at a road map together as the road stretched out behind them.

The photos will be used for a 16x16 foot backdrop at trade shows and as part of their product brochures. I should have some copies in a few days to post.

The bus got the better of the lighting conditions, casting a shadow over the B-mer, as is appropriate.

It was also the longest trip I've taken in the bus yet, about 75 miles one way, north of where I live at the intersection of California 41/145. Not exceptional mileage to many of you, but considering I've done far more wrenching than driving since purchasing last summer, it was a significant outing for me.  The new 4.12 fourth gear transmission had me holding 60 easy with the 1600SP and occasionally hitting 65.

Best part of the day was meeting Harry and Karl for delicious beverages at Sequoia Brewing in Fresno where we discussed volkswagens and homebrewing and dug the high school jazz players.

I was also invited to see Harry's fleet and some of his neat collector items. Thanks for the hospitality, Harry.

Finally, gassing up at the station across from Karl's house and checking his busses and legendary parts stash.

Caravan planning for upcoming B-field and Madera shows was discussed. Looking forward to a fine VW summer. 

All in all a fine bus day on a Wednesday and a fine finish with local bus pals.

Thanks again to Pelco, Harry and Karl for an awesome day.

Later,

Billy
