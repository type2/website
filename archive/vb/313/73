Subject: Costco Tent is XLNT Alternative to Westy tent IMHO

I noticed that Costco had a really nice tent FS.

Coleman brand "Salmon River" Cabin
10-12 person tent, 2 rooms 16'x12' w/ removable waterproof floor.
5 year warranty $144.99 Model# 9232-662

Seemed to be a really practical sturdy-enough substitute for the traditional
'1968> Westy tents. 

The walls etc. seem PERFECT for setting it up against the side of your bus
regardless of the vintage. 1950 splitty -2003 Eurocamper/MV

Pay me too much dinero for my last Westy tent and I'd be willing to rollover to
the Costco "make-do". =)
