Subject: I know where you can get a cool Split Westy interior

Greasy friends,

My boyz discovered a splittie out in the backwaters of Central Ewtah,
about 70 miles south and east of Provo, in Turkey Country.  The guy has
no title.  He bought it and cut out the rear end for to make a sand
buggy, so the bottom engine area is sans.  BUT they tell me the Westy
interior is intact and in very good condition.  I know this stuff is
hard to get a hold of.  I'd go get her but for two problems, first, no
way of transporting her with no rear end, and 2nd, no place to store
her.  Cops around here nail you for spitting on the sidewalk.  

You'd have to have a flatbed to haul it away, and oh, the guy is
offering for free, since there is no title.  Won't part out, . . . all
or nothing.  It is not that hard to get a lost title here in Ewtah.  

E-mail me off line if you are genuinely interested.  He wants to get
rid of it, but knows he can't just haul it to a junk yard with no title.
 The guy works with my son.

Best,

Curt
