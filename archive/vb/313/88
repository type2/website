I really like these gear wrenches.  I thought they were another gimmick until I borrowed some from a friend. I bought my own set, I prefer to use them instead of a ratchet. 
  My other favorite tools are my craftsman sockets with the built in universal joint. I use my 13mm all the time, like on the bolts for the DP intake manifold.
  My favorite wrench is a 19mm S&K I picked up used.  It has a really nice feel to it.
 
  VW's just give me a reason to use and collect tools...or the tools give me a reason to collect VW's, not sure which.

Oh, and maybe it's just here, but I sometimes find hazet tools at the pawn 
shop in the 25 cent bin... the kind of wrenches that came with VWs.
