Curt,

Have you checked yer endplay? I've never had this problem and I *grease*
my flywheel nut threads! I don't own a 250 ftlb rated TW. My method is to
tighten the nut with my 36 x 3/4 socket on the breaker bar til it's firm,
then I (the engine is fully assembled including exhaust, but w/o muffler)
put on my extender pipe onto the bar, and slowly continue turning the nut
until the engine just lifts up, pivoting on the left side heater box.
That's about 250 ftlbs. You do not let it bounce! Just smoothly til it
lifts. Then let it down. The engine weighs about 250 total, and the heater
box is around a foot from the nut, maybe an inch more. When the engine
lifts, you're at 250 ftlbs.

Works for the last 25 years or more.
