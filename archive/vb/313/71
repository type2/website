Jeff's got it right. I've got tools I've been using for 35+ years that were
made in .. well, who knows where?

The MAC and Snap-on guys stay in business by selling tools to mechanics that
work at shops and pay for them using the easy pay plan. They pay the driver
a little each week and essentially stay in debt to them for years.

Better carry a ~big~ wallet.

It's good stuff, but a Mac or Snap-On wrench is really not much better than
a Craftsman, unless you use it all day, every day.  It's been twenty years
since I bought my last tool off the truck, so I don't know where they're
being made any more...

If you want ~real~ tools for your VW, might as well get Hazet or
Stahlwille...  They aren't that much more than the ones from the truck, and
you get that added Teutonic atmosphere in your Werkstatt.
