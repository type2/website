Subject: Another question...

Hi again,

Okay, here is another question.  In a parts buyout purchase a while back I
received a bunch of Type 1 Beetle and a few Type 2 Bus wiper arms, most are
SWF brand for various '60's and '70's eras VW's and all NOS.  Most were
unmarked as to the VW part number and application.  The stuff that I was
familiar with, or had a car in our garage with the same wiper arms on it, I've
already figured out.  I've actually sold a few NOS pairs on ebarf (2 sets on
there right now) and folks seem delighted to get 'em cheap.

Does anyone know of a source of information out there somewhere (web site, old
VW literature, etc.) with descriptions, measurements, images of various wiper
products that might help me sort and finally identify these wiper parts?  I
have all the VW dealership parts manuals but they don't "illustrate" the
subtle differences so you can tell unmarked parts apart from each other.  A
source of photographs and/or various measurements would probably be the best.
I may have to resort to bringing one of each kind of wiper arm to a big show
and walking around comparing 'em to ones on cars to figure it all out.  But
what a pain in the ass that'll be, huh?

Eventually I'll probably trade/sell 'em off to finance the parts and goodies
that I'll need for our fleet of old VW's (currently eight!).  But right now
this NOS stuff is just collecting dust in my basement... so I might as well
try to identify it and move it along to the VW folks who'd love to have it for
their VW's.  Anyway, thanks for any assistance that you can provide!
