You must have something double jointed. I have to use a 13mm socket and
a 13mm wrench on the DP intakes, just like on SP, you can reach one 10mm
nut with a socket but the other has to be a wrench.

I really like these gear wrenches.  I thought they were another gimmick
until I borrowed some from a friend. I bought my own set, I prefer to
use them instead of a ratchet.
  My other favorite tools are my craftsman sockets with the built in
universal joint. I use my 13mm all the time, like on the bolts for the
DP intake manifold.
