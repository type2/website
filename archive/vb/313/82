Subject: Re: [VB] Sears and flywheels and forward carb nut

I got a PROTO 1 5/8" 3/4 drive socket for $14.95 at a pawn shop.   It's not 
like it gets used all that much, or that you do and undo those inner stub axle 
nuts very often, it's not like the oil drain plug, so I think the fraction 
doesn't matter.    

then again, I have a bunch of no name tools.   Like a thinner 13mm wrench 
that can be used for the tricky carb nut.  Thinner where the circle hex goes 
around the nut...  you could thin one down a bit to get more clearance and thus 
more turn per time.

I also have a 27mm proto wrench for the front axle nuts 64-67.   It was cheap 
at a pawn shop, and I modified it with a grinder so it can fit and hold the 
inner axle nut while I turn the outter one with an adjustable wrench.   I saw 
someone, probably Greg Noble, with some VW tools made for that, looked really 
nice.   

I wouldn't bother spending extra on pricey straight wrenches though.   Except 
a 7mm. 

    But ever have a favorite wrench?   my favorite 13mm... forget the brand, 
but it has a distinctive V notch cut down into it.   It just feels nice

Oh, and maybe it's just here, but I sometimes find hazet tools at  the pawn 
shop in the 25 cent bin... the kind of wrenches that came with VWs.

s only for emergencies.  I hate using them, unless I absolutely have to.  I 
also dislike using fractional tools on metric hardware, but when 41mm sockets 
aren't readily available, what do you do?  I know the size is close, but it is 
not exact.
