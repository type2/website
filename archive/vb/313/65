Subject: cargo door table hardware

I keep putting off making some useful fold-up tables for my cargo
doors in my westy, because I can't find any hardware that I like for
the "hold up support" part. I've looked in some of my woodworkers
catalogs, but can't find anything to my liking. Does anyone have any
suggestions on where I can look for such a thing?
