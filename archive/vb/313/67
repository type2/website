Subject: Re: cargo door table hardware

I used a piano hinge for the platform (table) to allow it to 
fold down against the door. I attached a triangular piece of 
plywood to the door panel vertically with a piano hinge so 
that the top of the triangle held the table up in the 
horizontal position.

Clear the table, fold the triangle against the door, the
table folds down and out of the way.

There are various ways to hold the triangle top in position
under the table top. If the table is for something heavy,
you can design two triangles to support it. You can notch
the triangles, cut filigrees or whatever to fancy it up too.

Then there is the traditional locking angle bracket too,
but I didn't like their wimpyness compared to a piece of
vertical plywood.
