Subject: Bus stereo question...

Hi all,

Recently there has been discussion about larger stereo systems being used on
stock Bus electrical systems and problems and solutions.  "Caps" (whatever
they are) were mentioned as a way of eliminating drop outs , etc.

I have a 15 year old or so AM/FM/cassette stereo in the dash of my '67 Westy
(I'm guessing about 10 watts per side?).  It runs through an equally old Radio
Shack brand 40 watt equalizer/power amp and out to 4 fairly unremarkable car
stereo speakers (two in the front doors and two in the rear of the Bus).
Sounds great when I don't crank it up to high, but as I increase the volume
toward loud, the volume occasionally pulses or drops temporarily.  The louder
you go the more frequent the "drop-out" of volume.  I assumed it was maybe
drawing too much power at that point.  Does that simple description sound
right/familiar to you audio experts?  If so, could you comment on a solution
(those "caps", etc.) in plain English for us audio rookies?  You know, what
they are, what they do, where to get 'em, how to install them properly, how to
obtain a wiring diagram of how they should be installed, etc.?  Us "rookies'
would sure appreciate your guidance!

Thanks again,
