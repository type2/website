That sounds an awful like what I have on my 30A gen system. I run two
10Kuf 350V caps with .001uf 100V across them and an inline 12uh choke
for the ignition noise in my solid copper spark cables.

If you have any problems with power supply, just install a cap to the
system.

Years ago I had a system that would spike a 50 amp ammeter continously
and cause a lot of distortion (over 600 watt system in my 66 Westy). I
installed a 1 Fahrad cap into the system, and when playing my 'new'
Nirvana album as loud as I could stand it, it drew a steady 10-11 amps.
Very nice.
