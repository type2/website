A "Cap" is just short for capacitor.They are like a power reserve, able to
charge very fast, and discharge very fast. They are pretty overkill unless
you have a pretty large system. My current bus, i'm running 100 watts to
some speakers, and i'm far from needing to add a cap to the system. It
helped a lot when I was running 610 watt's with my old system about 7-8
years ago with a 12" sub taking 360 watts. (oh the things I thought were
cool when I was younger.....)

If your headlights dim to the beat of the music (not counting when you're at
idle), a cap will help. They are pricy, so don't buy one unless you know for
sure if you need one or not. Unless they've come down in price, it's been
almost a decade since I bought my last one.
