I've rejetted them to 140 main and 60 air and they will run on a 1776. I
assume you are using a 009 or 050 distributor?

I have a ton of new Brosol 30/31s. Assuming correct jetting, how will
this carb perfrom on a 1776 DP with 041s and a 110 cam with mild
compression? This is for a heavy sportsmobile. I am considering this
until my duals come in.
