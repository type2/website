Josh, it really does all depend. It "could" just be a good old engine
that was maintained well but for some reason a rod bearing spun and
locked up or something like that where it just needs rod bearings. I
know this is what you were wanting to hear ;) Unfortunately I doubt it
will work that way. If the engine locked up while running due to
running low on oil this is most likely an abused engine. It could be
very rebuildable, but you will have to get it and start work on it. A
great learning experience anyway. 

did you get an entire camper? or just a shell?
