They have a great selection of fractional metric sockets, when the several sixteenths ( cresent wrench) won't do.  But seriously, the several sixteenths is only for emergencies.  I hate using them, unless I absolutely have to.  I also dislike using fractional tools on metric hardware, but when 41mm sockets aren't readily available, what do you do?  I know the size is close, but it is not exact.
 
As far as the Crapsman stuff, the quality is so so, but you can't beat the availablity and warranty.  I have some Snap-on and Mac, but it's mostly odd's and ends.  The bulk of what I have is Crapsman, but If i was doing it everyday I would go Snap-on.

You mean a 1 and 10/16ths, right? I hear the 1 and 20/32nd and the 1 and 
40/64ths will fit too. Somebody said a 1 and 2 and a half fourths would 
work, but I think they had been drinking beer.
