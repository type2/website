Better carry a ~big~ wallet.

It's good stuff, but a Mac or Snap-On wrench is really not much better than 
a Craftsman, unless you use it all day, every day.  It's been twenty years 
since I bought my last tool off the truck, so I don't know where they're 
being made any more...

If you want ~real~ tools for your VW, might as well get Hazet or 
Stahlwille...  They aren't that much more than the ones from the truck, and 
you get that added Teutonic atmosphere in your Werkstatt.
