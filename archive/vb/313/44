Make sure when you do this that you disconnect the #15 wire, and tape it so 
it won't spark.  You should see how well that gas being atomized on it's 
way out of the spark plug hole will ignite...or maybe you ~shouldn't~  and 
you can still get a spark off the coil if you just pull out the HT lead.
