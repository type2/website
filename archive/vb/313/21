http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ignition.htm#B6465 says the 111 905 205 M is
the same as Bosch ZV/JU4R3, which means you can look on page E-9 12 of
your '63-'67 Bentley for the advance curve in tabular form:

mm Hg        crankshaft degrees
18.5 - 24.5  Advance begins
29   - 38    10 degrees
50           16 - 22 degrees (end of advance)
