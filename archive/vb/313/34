I just had someone with this problem last Dec. Towed his bus up to the
house and pulled the engine and it was a broken gland nut and the
flywheel had fallen partially off jammed in the bell housing.

I got home and parked on the kerb outside my gate and shut
the engine down; it was idling fine. I went inside and
opened the garage door and then got back in the bus and
turned the key: THUKK!! Turned it again and THUKK!! I went
back to the engine to find I couldn't turn it over by hand
with the crank pulley. It's locked solid.
