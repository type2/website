If you have any problems with power supply, just install a cap to the
system.

Years ago I had a system that would spike a 50 amp ammeter continously and
cause a lot of distortion (over 600 watt system in my 66 Westy). I installed
a 1 Fahrad cap into the system, and when playing my 'new' Nirvana album as
loud as I could stand it, it drew a steady 10-11 amps. Very nice.
