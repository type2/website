Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Adjusting the Ring and Pinion

That is exactly the book that I am using to rebuild my tranny. The 
problem is the 3.88 is extracted from a 1973 (by memory?) transmission 
and the Bentley only deals with pinions that have the "r" number 
written on them. The 3.88 pinion contains absolutely no numbers. The 
ring gear only has the ratio stamped on it. I am hoping that someone 
has made a '67 or earlier freeway flyer before and has run across this 
problem.
