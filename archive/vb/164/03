Subject: 205/75/15 Tires?

I did a ot of research through the archives that suggested I could put this
size tire on the rear of my bus.  I ordered the tires, they were Uniroyal
Tiger Paws and my tire shop just called me.  They fit them on the rims but
could not get them into the wheel wells.  Did I screw this up or am I
missing something.  Any insight would be appreciated.
