Subject: re:oil filler problem

i have teh same problem on my engine-well similar. i have not figured out
how to tighten mine, but it is loose. i got the little tool-but the "ears"
or what ever you call the things that stick out-look wider than the slots in
the nut.

ronnie had suggested a tool to me that can be found a local hardware store-i
forget what it is called. i think he said it is used for threading inside a
pipe.
