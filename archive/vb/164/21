Jim,
If you are talking a later model bus it's not an issue for the rears.
Only 61 and
earlier I think.  215/15 donn't even come close to being a problem on my
67.  I hear you can run 235s on them.
On my 58 they are troublesome.

Yeah, I use it so the rubber doesn't hang up so much on the metal.  The
double layer of plastic helps it slide in.

On the fronts of an early bus there are no clearance issues.  On a later
one you have to beat the jackpoint ridges out of the way with a bigass
hammer.

Maybe I can borrow the camera and send you some pics.
