Subject: RE: [VB] how to rebuild engine video

You know, I can't really say if they have a site. I bought that one, "How to
Hot Rod Your VW", and "How to Rebuild Your VW Transmission" in the late
eighties or early nineties. Gosh, has it been that long ago? I had also
purchased the two "This old Vair" videos for the Corvair. I can get the tape
back from my son, seen it on his video shelf, and review the section on
distributor drive gear placement. Heck, I think that's a good idea anyway.
Could be valuable info for the list.
