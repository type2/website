Subject: RE: [VB] 205/75/15 Tires?

Here's another question regarding my tire dilemma.  Would the reason the
tires won't fit be that my rear end is too low?  Last winter I had a new
tranny with rgb's installed and after getting the bus back from the
installer it seemed to me that he didn't raise it as much as he could have.
I planned to readjust the spring plates this winter to get more height.
Would that be the cause of my problem?  Thanks

Not the best tire in my opinion, but if you like them more power to you.  I 
have a set on 14" rims and hate them, 195/75/R14... Sitting in a pile in the

backyard.


The 205/75R15 should fit.  Actually a 215 will fit as well.

How are they jacking up the bus?  The swing axle must be unloaded so that it

hands down to access all the lugs and the tire can fit up in the whole.  If 
they used a lift and put it on the swing arm or RGBs it will be impossible 
to get a tire on.

Good Luck,
