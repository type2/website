Subject: RE: [VB] Is this Orginal?

The only campers I knew that should have them were dormobiles. I didn't
think just a sunroof option would get you bellypans. Wasn't sure of a
Kombi/Standard with sunroof only option, don't see them often.

I have only seen belly pans on deluxes and
double-doors. I have seen plenty of Kombi's that do
not have bellypans. SO42 Westfalias for example are
kombis that, is they were ordered with a pop-top, were
sunroof models. I have never seen a SO42 with belly
pans.
