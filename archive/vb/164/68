Subject: Re: [VB] steering box

well, I glue it to keep it from dripping.  it seems hard to get every speck 
of dirt off to have a nice flat surface.  I get the permatex aviation sealant 
at my local FLAPS.   It comes in a little tub with a brush stuck to the cap 

You shouldn't have to make any adjustments.  Then again you might knock loose 
a pile of crust and find you box is actually very worn.

 the thing is i don't want to open the steering box if that means i would
 then need to make some adjustments to my steering wheel-because my steering
 is pretty good right now. it probably isn't perfect but right now i dont
 want to add (what vould potentially be)another tricky job to my plate.
 
 so if i take the 4 bolt off, and clean the area out with some spray lube,
 why do you glue the shims back in? and where do you get aviation
 sealant-would my FLAPS carry this?
