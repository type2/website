*********************************
Although the mechanical curves on the Type 3's are slightly conservative by
2 or 3 degrees (72 model as an example), they're quite adequate to use on
the Type 1 or Type 2 upright 1600.  I have recently update my site to show
all of the Type 3 and Type 4 distributors, so it might be worth a looksee.
The distributors Mr. Heath shows are for the 70s era Beetles.

To add a twist to this, my 205T (69-70 Bug & Bus) distributor on my 68 Bug
gave up the ghost about a month ago - the upper shaft slot (that holds the
rotor) somehow had a chip taken out of the slot, causing the rotor to be
too loose and creep up the shaft to severely grind away the carbon brush
and top inside of the cap.  My buddy Cliff had a spare distributor (0231
170 093) which was OE on the 74 Type 4 (He's a 411/412 nut) and late 76-78
Buses, 79-83 Federal Bus & Vanagons.  On a lark, we popped it in for
temporary use and wow, talk about response!  Been running it for month now
and purrs away with no problems.  Timed it about 30 degrees BTDC (-at-) 3000rpm.

Just my nickels worth :-)
