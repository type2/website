Actually, the 019 (Original Bosch VJR 4BR 8/1) is an ancestor of the 009.
Cast Iron case, most I've ever seen are blue in color.  Never seen a chrome
one, but that don't mean someone couldn't have chromed one or two in their
lifetime.  BTW, Chrome 009's are Bosch 9230 081 094 outa Brazil.

Check my site, you'll find the 019 was originally installed on 49-12/53
Bugs and 3/55-59 Type 2s, (010's were too) at least that's what Bosch & VW
keep sayin' in their references.
