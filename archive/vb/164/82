Subject: what year is my bus?

I would like to thank all those who responded to my query on what year my newly
acquired bus is, but you were not consistent. I had 14 responses, 8 said '59, 6
said '60....

Well, I will plead ignorant, as this is the second split I have ever owned....

The info below was emailed to me and this inclines me to think that the westy I
just bought is for sure a '59. Others referred to this info also and therefore I
believe it to be correct. Assuming that VW did a model year change in September
that year, not August.

> 24 Sept 1959  511 907
> 28 Sept 1959  514 149
> 30 Sept 1959  514 885  Begin 1960 model year

Mine is 511518.

Question #2: This bus has what you refer to as a 'subhatch' on it. What SO-?? is
this supposed to be?
Question #3: Are these fairly common?
