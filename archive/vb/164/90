Subject: Re: [VB] how to rebuild engine video

hi again, thanks Andrew and TexRexMexPondidn'tgotothebuginRogers, there
is a good machine shop here in Fort Worth that does very good ACVW work
so that's covered. and I do have an impact but it might not do 220 ft.
lbs. I'd kinda like to learn how to rebuild it even if I wasn't saving
much money just to know how to fix whatever might break and having the
satisfaction of driving something I rebuilt. Just wondered about those
how to videos, they seem like a good idea. Messing up compression ratio
or something complicated like that kinda worries me. There's a dune buggy
guy in my neighborhood who can rebuild them but I think he doesn't like
people hanging around watching : (
