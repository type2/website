Subject: removal of gearshift rod

quick question about removing the gear shift rod...after re-reading the
bentley manual i see it states to "Detach hand brake cables from hand brake
lever"

i was able to get mine out without doing this. did i do something wrong? or
could something be hooked up incorrectly?
