Subject: Forged or not

I pulled my engine out of my bus today and the end play is .008 in., not good, time for a rebuild.

I'm going to put a CW crank back in and looking around I see there are some good deals on forged CW
stock cranks, about $200.00 or so.

Question is, should I shell out the beans for a forged CW crank or go cheap and get a welded one.
Also, should I pop for forged P&C's?
