Subject: radio mounting

Hi All,

I was doing some more wiring on the double cab last night and thought I
would fit my blaupunkt 'frankfurt' radio... I was wondering if there should
be any support bracket in the back and if so, where does it attach?

Also, along the lines of radios, I'm looking for a good antenna cable for a
hirschmann antenna and the power connector to the radio.  Oh, AND THE LITTLE
RED TIP for the antenna.


TIA

David
