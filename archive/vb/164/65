The 019 distributors are excellent.  Superior to the 009.   Just a little 
more tricky to get parts for, so when you can get the points etc, buy a 
couple spares.  These came on 36hp buses in the 50s I think.

 there was an 019 distributer, blue in color.

 Any body know what it is for?  Should I replace it with a German 231-178-009
 unit I have??
