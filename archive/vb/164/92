Subject: RE: [VB] how to rebuild engine video

I bought both the Rooster productions video, "How to rebuild you VW engine",
and the Bug Me series "Rebuilding your VW engine" for my oldest son. Both
are good in their own way, but the Rooster productions video had a slick
never fail method of installing your distributor drive gear and spacers and
setting static timing that beats all other methods. I would recommend either
to a first timer.

Subject: [VB] how to rebuild engine video


hi favorite list!, I took my tired but good engine out to investigate why
all my oil is disappearing. It wasn't leaking from the oil cooler like I
suspected, but from somewhere behind the cylinder 3&4 head. And I noticed
one of the top middle 15mm nuts had backed itself off. So, I thought I'd
torque the heads to 23ft. lbs. and be good to go. But when I started
tightening the loose nut it start pulling the stud out of the case. It's
an "H" case and does not appear to have heli-coils or case savers. So
what should I do from here? I've never rebuilt an engine but want to
learn how, and might like to have case savers installed. I have the
Bently, Wilson, and Idiot ( my personal favorite : ) books, but am still
unsure about being able to do a rebuild. are the how to rebuild engine
videos very good? can I watch one and learn most of what I would need to
know? and who makes the best video? TIA for any advice.
