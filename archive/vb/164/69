Subject: mangled stud

Volks,
where's a good place to get a replacement piece?  What I need is the stud
that holds the heater box into the front (fif) of the motor.  broke it bad
trying to get the bolt off.  It is a larger size in the case then a smaller
size for the heater box flange. What is this called?  What are those two
different sizes and what is the thread type?  Any one have one they'll just
throw in the mail to me?

TIA
Wes and the un-named '58 sc with the 1600dp
