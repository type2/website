Subject: re:accelerator cable/synflex

i just picked up some synflex...best place to pick up around here is this
brake shop, that works on big rigs. the parts place for the trucks would
only sell in 100' lengths. the brake shop sold me about 8' for $3.

the size you want is 1/4"-it is measured by outer diameter. that size was
just large enough to fit the end of the accelerator cable.
