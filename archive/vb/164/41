Harry p-mail me with your address, have some "classy" Jerome pics for you.
Where did you and Carl go?
Jerome was GREAT this year. More "laid back and cool" as Ellis would say. No
worries at all. Thanks to the ABC for the best Jerome ever in my opinion,
and I have been there from the beginning. Thanks to the Terrible 2's and
J.P. for Sun. DeDe, Denise and I both owe you forever, thanks again.
 The trip through the dez was PERFECT for the 2 buses that went. We covered
74 miles in 5 hours and had a blast, no getting towed by the Bronco. Want to
see more buses next year. Ronnie and his group still have to learn how to
read a map. They missed the Seligman turn and went through the red clay
mudboggs and finally called for help. Great offroad trip from Ashfork to
Jerome, 9 buses. Covered the 34 miles in a little over 2 hours. A must do
next year for all of you who have the time. Hope to see all at BBB this
year.
