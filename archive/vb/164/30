Subject: Bellypans - Is this Original?

i think everyone is leaving out subhatch flip seat westies.  i know of a very original '64 that has them, so i can only assume that all flipseats should have bellypans.  i don't think it has so much to do with the hole in the roof, as it does with not having a bulkhead + a hole in the roof.
