Thanks John,
I was refering to a '63 that I recently picked up. Wheelwells are stock/uncut.
For clarification, I think JK or Jon Furst mentioned that the vertical metal
ridge that runs vertically on the rear face of the front wheel well [in visual
alignment with the lower rocker edge]may need to be finessed (beaten flat) with
a hammer to provide more clearence for the 215 tires. I will report to the list
as I proceed with the tire mounting. Prior to anyone running out to the
driveway with a hammer- I'd hang back until it becomes mandatory. Beating on a
bus with a hammer kind of goes against my grain.
