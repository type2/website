Subject: RE: 215-75-15 tires

John Kyte mentioned that he runs 215 tires on his bus. Does John or anyone else
post photos of a bus running the 215s?. theSamba.com/vw or Vintagebus.com. 
I have a set of tires that size that I am about to have mounted on rims and run
for a while.

Please re-explain what you do with the plastic bag? You "lubricate" the wheels
with the plastic bag? I dont get it... Is the bag used between the rear wheel
well and the rubber of the tire to get it to squeeeeeeze past the fender?

Lastly, what compensation -if any- needs done to the front wheel wells?
