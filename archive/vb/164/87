Not for threading, just for turning.  It's called an "internal pipe
wrench"

This is my tool of last resort for removing the oil filler gland nut.  The
nut is kind of thin and I don't want to distort it, so I start with the
tool that bears on the slots.  If that doesn't work, the pipe wrench works
fine!
