Subject: 6v to 12 volt starter the easy way.

Ok, I made a bit of a small discovery today.  I am in the planning stage of
converting a 1958 bus to 12v.  I started thinking about the starter thing,
and I read somewhere that the 12v Automatic Bug/Ghia trans had a 12v starter
that had a self supporting bearing, and gear, and didn't use the brass
bushing that is in the housing.  Now most people know a 12v stock starter
will not bolt up to the 6v trans without changing the brass bushing.  Now
the last brass bushing that I changed was a SOB to get out (and leaving the
tranny stock is a plus if you're a vintage NAZI unlike me).

So, I called Aut0z0ne the local parts house about 1 block from work.  I
asked them if they had a starter to fit a '71 Automatic bug.  They said yes.
So I drove over, and had them pull out both the Manual and Automatic
starters, and sure enough it was a self supporting rebuilt BOSCH starter.
VERY clean, and very nice gear (haven't tried it yet). So I asked them the
price, it was $5 CHEAPER than the manual trans starter.  I got the starter
for $59 and some change, and I will get a $10 core charge if I return ANY
starter.  That's cool. It also has a lifetime warranty, and I know the
policy works because I've exchanged 3 generators since I bought my first one
in 1993 (Hey, I know it wasn't the EXACT generator that I took in for
exchange, but how was I to know when I have about 5 in my shop).

I hope this little bit of info helps someone else.

Now all I have to do is grind out the bellhousing for the bigger flywheel.

Later
Charles
