Subject: RE: [VB] turn signal question

they changed around late 61 model year/beginning of 62 model year on both.

you can switch to the wing nut, but you must also change the arm. if you
use the early arm with a wing nut there is nothing for the wingnut to
"lock" into and adjustment will be a constant issue, as the wingnut will
loosen itself. the later arm has a diamond shaped space for the wingnut to
"lock" itself in place. and yes, there is a correct way to put the arm on,
either early or late.

oval ones, and when did rear turn  signals turn from cicles to the ovals?
also, on pre 70 busses, can you switch the 11mm and 14mm nuts on the clutch
release lever to a wing nut?
