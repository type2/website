Subject: Parts needed

I'm looking for the correct rear engine tin for a '65.  This would have only
1 small carb preheater hole.  I'm also looking for a '67 windshield wiper
switch, part #211 955 517 in good shape.  I have some extra gas heater parts
(for BN4 or BA6) like glow plugs, fuel pumps and timer switches to trade if
interested otherwise cash.

Thanks,

Thomas
