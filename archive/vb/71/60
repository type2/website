Late 61 for most of the world, but apperantly for Italy market the bullet 
continued to 64.

Yes, and no.  The earlier clutch cables have smaller thread size on the rear 
end.  To install the wing nut you need a later clutch cable the same length 
as the earlier one with it's larger thread size to fit.  You can if you grind 
off the nubs on the forward side of the wingnut to match the earlier style 
and use it with the earlier style curved arm.  So far for us in our 1960 
panel camper we have had over five years this way with no noticable backing 
off due to having no lock nut.  Do not just install the later straight clutch 
arm without changing the left axle side plate first.  Otherwise the end of 
the cable is moved out of alignment and the clutch cable wears badly on the 
end of the boden tube.  We found out the hard way with two 6,000 to 10,000 
mile clutch cables that wore out on the end of the boden tube instead of the 
usual 30,000+ lifespan clutch cables we usually got before and have gotten 
since this little experiment.   Eric&Barb
PS There is even a later longer straight arm that requires a completely 
differant tranny side plate to work properly!   EEE&B
