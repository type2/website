Our normal shipping method to Canada is U.S. air mail, not UPS, because its
generally much cheaper than UPS Ground (as there are no hidden brokerage
fees).  Typically it takes about 10-14 days for delivery; it gets to the
Canadian border in just a few days, but then goes the rest of the way via
the traditional Canadian surface mail system.  The only drawback to airmail
is that it cannot be tracked. This means that, even though the package is
insured, if it doesn't arrive they make you wait 30 days before considering
it lost. However, my experience with the postal service (both in terms of
damage and loss) has been excellent, in fact more reliable than UPS, so that
very rarely becomes an issue.   For express service, we can use either
Global Express Mail, or UPS Air.  (Unlike UPS standard international ground
service, no additional brokerage fees are charged with UPS International
Air.)

We generally claim the full value of the item plus shipping as the declared
and insured value. This only makes sense, as in the event of loss or damage,
you would not want to be reimbursed less than the full amount that you paid.
However, if writing the parts up "parts for vintage car" reduces the duty,
then we can certainly do that.   In fact I'll have the shipping guys start
doing it right away, as there's no downside.
