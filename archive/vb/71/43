Subject: Z Products Z-Bed Conversion Kit

In researching stuff for my '67 Microbus, I came across Z Products' Z-Bed
conversion kit (www.zproducts.com). I was very interested in it, until later
reading in the archive that they had stopped producing the kit. This kit is
the only one I know of that lets you use the original back seat in a VW bus
and convert it to a bed when desired, rather than installing a
Westfalia-type camper Z-bed or a homemade convertible back "sofa." I like
the idea of retaining the original look of my non-camper, but easily being
able to camp, too.

Anyway, I was interested enough to call them today and plead, and I found
out they do make them, but only when they have enough interest to run a
batch. They told me that interest has dropped to the point where no batch
has been run in a while. I replied that since many people believe they no
longer make the kit, that may be why no one is calling or emailing to order.

For them, a batch is about thirty units (for any bus up to '79), not the
half-dozen or so they presently have customer names for. I asked them to add
my name to the list, and I wanted everyone on Vintagebus and Type2 to know
that the product can be available if enough of us ask for it. I think it's
an elegant solution for a non-camper conversion bus, and I have to believe
there's enough interest out there to generate sufficient orders, once people
realize that it is available and know exactly what it is.

Let them know if you're interested.
