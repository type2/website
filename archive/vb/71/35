Not a sign of the times but I propose that we start a VW Bus parts
co-op.  We have VW parts pros Ronnie, Ron S.and others who we could pay
big bucks to run the co-op from east to left coasts.  I do not want to
sound ugly but the truth is that we are a strange and weird tribe.  We
are not really normal, save for maybe Thom F.  We need to get the best
hunters and gatherers to supply the needs of our tribe.   The market
place shines here and there but it does not represent us in any
significant way.  We might start thinking about getting past the Bus
nonsense that the market thinks we want.   We need quality parts that
will last.  We are too fat and complacent to replace rubber parts every
year.  We need to demonstrate our laziness and love of beer and TV in
terms of keeping our wheels on the road with the least amount of
effort.  RMMW had a great catalog and OK service.  They were not part of
our tribe.  Shame on them!  These thoughts may be difficult for many on
the list.  In a quiet moment think about yourself and your bus.  I'll
leave you right there....   Gary Gibson
