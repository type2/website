Subject: Re: [VB] Re: ordering vw part from US to Canada


First and last comment on this thread.

A friend of mine was involved in an industry that made extensive use of 
shipping and he commented that East-West shipping has always been worse than 
North-South shipping all things being equal.  Something to do with traffic 
and volume etc.  Needless to say I after comparing I generally order to use 
North-South shipping rather than the alternative when parts quality is the 
same provider regardless.  I do order from Canada...

Bus content: Got my front bumper, very nice one from CMeanly in BC, Canada.  
Met him on his cruise South... nice guy.
