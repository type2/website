I was getting 2 catalogs every months or so, unsolicited.

BTW, Bus Depot gets a lot of their stuff from RMMW, and has it
drop-shipped from RMMW, so....

I think the VWOA debacle is what really nailed 'em.

I'd be willing to give them all back if it would help them out.  Seriously though, I'd hate to see them go under (even though I started to buy all me parts from Bus Depot ;^)
