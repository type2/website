how are you going to weld the captive strip when youve tightened up the 
window in the right place ? you cant get at the strip to weld it ???

Hi Dave,
Thanks for the very interesting info on your repro safaris!  They sound as 
good as the originals, and hopefully less prone to corrosion.  We have a bad 
copy of the Shop Bulletian on installing safaris, but can not find it right 
now.  Darn!  If we remember correctly VW suggested the shops weld the plate 
in place or risked having the nut plate strip fall away and disappear 
whenever the safaris were removed for repair, or body work on the bus.  We 
would make the nut plate strip about 50-60mm longer than the safari hinge.  
When drilling the slightly larger holes in the upper body frame for the 
mounting screws to go through, we would drill two extra holes outside of the 
hinge length.  Once the nut plate strip and window are screwed together and 
adjusted for proper fit inside the one could mig weld these two outer holes 
to the nut plate strip, or drill and tap it for two extra much longer screws. 
 If one installed these two extra screws one could adjust slightly the 
safaris if needed later.  Especially if a replacement seal was not quite 
sealing in an area or another.  Also using anchoring screws for the nut plate 
strip would reduce the amount of welding needed that could marr glass and 
other interior components with welding splatter.
  By the way are you volks producing a outer seals with molded corners as the 
originals for increased sealing in these areas?
  Thanks again, Eric&Barb
