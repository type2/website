Hi Charles,
Or you could have installed a 200mm six volt FW and kept the six volt 
starter.  That combo on 12 volts will really start even in -6 below weather.  
The only other change we do is to install a 12 volt solinoid to avoid 
pounding the FW teeth to death with the starter gear.  Can not find a 200mm 
six volt toothed FW?  There are Fw shops that will take your 12 FW and cut 
off the teeth and press on a new six volt ring gear.
