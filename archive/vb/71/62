Subject: Re: [VB] turn signal question

ok, i have been somewhat corrected, although i had not heard of it, nor
experienced it on any of my vehicles. 
printed in bentley is: "the new clutch lever (meaning straight--jon) and
the wing nut can only be subsequently installed if the transmission case
and the left final drive cover are replaced." M-26,page 2 although i don't
know why you'd have to replace the case too....oh wait.. i think it may
have to do with the side covers with o-rings?
hey, ya learn something new every day.

[Original message before above]
you can switch to the wing nut, but you must also change the arm. if you
use the early arm with a wing nut there is nothing for the wingnut to
"lock" into and adjustment will be a constant issue, as the wingnut will
loosen itself. the later arm has a diamond shaped space for the wingnut to
"lock" itself in place. and yes, there is a correct way to put the arm on,
either early or late.
