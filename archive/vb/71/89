Subject: RE: [VB] T4 tranny into a vintagebus

I'd go with the Berg Bus trans adapter kit.  It costs more than the other
options but fits and shifts better.  I'm not sure what kind of tranny Scott
Fraser is running but he has installed the T4 into his bus.

Big bus IRS stuff can be installed. There's kits out there that do it
right now. And there are mounting adapters that allow for a T4 tranny
to be installed into a bug.
