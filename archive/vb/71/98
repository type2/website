Subject: RE: [VB] Lost a hubcap!

again, THE DEALER HAS THEM. you can special order them all day long from
them, since it's doubtful they have them in stock.
usually their turnaround time is a week.
i know foreign aide in albuquerque usually stocks vw/german/nos ones, AND
the rivets. about $1.25 each. 1-800-658-5712.
