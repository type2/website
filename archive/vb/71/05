Hi Steve,
There are rumors that we both have royalty in both our families.  Eric has 
traced his lineage to a small town in Germany which has almost the same 
spelling as his last name.  A peasant ancestor of his is rumored to have 
organized the locals and kicked some Viking invader butt.  Thus getting a 
land grant and some kind of title.   Barb supposedly has Bohemian royalty in 
her background (this may be a long running family joke, but it is unwise to 
argue with a Germanic/Chech/Bohemian/Polish woman while she is holding a cast 
iron skillet).  Why do we write this way?  Habit, we both are into the VWs, 
and we usually yak over and write most of the emails together.  Barb always 
says if you talk to one of us, you are also talking to the other one too.  We 
are a little more "together" than most couples, but it works for us!    Sorry 
to keep you in suspense of whom is writing when, but it will continue.  ;-)
Eric&Barb
