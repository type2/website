Just a comment and nothing more.....

Of all the old original 36 hp VW's I have seen in the past 20+ years, the
original intake manifold has been painted black with the cast metal "center"
left in metal. Yet... when on the one or two occasions, I have had the
opportunity to buy NOS from a dealer supply they are grey.....

In a passing "vintage" moment.....

Getting ready to paint or have coated the intake for a 36 horse thats going
in  the 57, anyone found something that lasts? Any negative effects to
having it jet hot coated?
thanks
