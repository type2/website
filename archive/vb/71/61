Subject: Re: [VB] turn signal question

front turn signals switched in '63 model year to the round ones. Don't know
if it was right at the beginning of the year; you could probably find some
early '63's  with the bullets, but the round ones were definitely there by 6
March 1963 (my bus has got 'em).

'63 Standard with WAY too many important one year only parts....

> heya everyone- when did front turn signals turn from bullets to the big
oval ones, and when did rear turn  signals turn from cicles to the ovals?
also, on pre 70 busses, can you switch the 11mm and 14mm nuts on the clutch
release lever to a wing nut?
