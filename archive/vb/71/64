Subject: RE: safari's (was CE )

Ok i measured Kents orginial safari's This morning and the set of support
plates(orginial) i use for patterns for the plates i make.
Deminsions area as follows in inches
Hinge itself 17 5/16  long
1st hole is from edge of plate 3/8 to c/l (same from other end to first
hole )
1/4 hole with a counter sunk area around, looks to be 5/16 or so, (round
holes not slotted)
other than the first 2 holes from each end, the holes are 2 3/4 on c/l.....
Support plate:
17 3/4 overall length
edge of plate to first hole c/l  7/16
holes on 2 3/4 c/l from that first hole from each end.
threaded 4mm .70 pitch.
Hope this helps with the topic. Its too early for me to try to convert this
to mm so your on your own. Grin ,Later
