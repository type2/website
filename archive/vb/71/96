	I just use a Pop Rivet with the head of the rivet on the back
side of the rim. I also use a washer for it tight down on to make it
gooden tight. This works well and you don't have to beat on the rivet to
make it tight. Also no one will see it and they are easy to drill out if
the clip breaks.
I know this is not vintage but it works and with not a lot of effort you
are on your way.  :-0

Most VWFLAPS have the hubcap clips. Just from previous experience, try
like hell to find GERMAN VW hubcap clips.  The repro ones are pretty
crappy IMHO.  On a few occasions I've actually bought clips from a new
VW dealer.

I tend to pop my hupcaps off pretty regularly, to check brake
adjustment, wheel bearings, seals,...etc etc.  And every repro clip Ive
had has broke.  I replace with a German one..and it lasts.

In regards to the rivets..search the type2.com archives.  There are a
few solutions to your problem.  Unless you want to be completely OG
stock, I've had pop rivets work fine for all my VW's.  I beleive Rex
Rogers used small countersunk nuts and bolts.  Anyways...there are alot
of options.
