First of all, Chapter 11 is not liquidation, it's reorganization, so this
doesn't mean that RMMW is going out of business. Many companies bounce back
out of Chapter 11, and some even go in and out of Chapter 11 multiple times
and still live to talk about it.

We only get a small portion of what we sell from RMMW, and on many of those
items we have multiple sources anyway. (Often we choose RMMW as the supplier
because they're willing to dropship, easy to work with, and a very reliable
vendor, not because they're the only ones who have the part.)  So if RMMW
were to disappear, it would not cripple us by any means (although small
shops that rely on them heavily would be hit much harder).  It also would be
unlikely to cause widespread parts unavailability, although isolated items
that they import exclusively could go away (at least until someone else
filled the gap).

If the company did go away, however, it could cause prices to go up on some
parts - simply because whenever any wholesale supplier leaves the market,
there is that much less competition, and less competition means less
downward pricing pressure (plain old Economics 101 here).  And, of course it
would void their "lifetime warranty."  (Maybe even a Chapter 11 filing can
affect that; I'm not a bankruptcy attorney so I'm not sure.)

The ones at higher risk in a bankruptcy filing (generally speaking) are the
company's suppliers, rather than its customers  - those who supplied the
bankrupt company with product, and now may receive pennies on the dollar in
return.  A small manufacturer whose major or sole customer files bankruptcy
of any sort could end up going bankrupt himself, depending on how much he
was owed.

But, like I said, Chapter 11 does not mean liquidation, so don't read too
much into it.
