<< Hey all,
 
 Any idea whether the rear cargo door (not the rear door, but the left hand 
cargo door - as you look it from the side on a LHD model) latching mechanism 
from a '65 can be transplanted into a '63? Did they change any of the 
latching mechanisms in the cargo doors during these years?

yes, you can use it.   at some point they added the inside lockability 
option, 65 has that, the 63 may not, but they are interchangable functionally.

when replacing yours, hold the upped check rod when you remove the mechanism, 
so it doesn't fall down w/ gravity, as it is PITA to put it back in the right 
place.
