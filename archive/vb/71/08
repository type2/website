Subject: Proper rear tin, was RE: [VB] Front engine compartment seal

Yeah I need one of those also but for a '65 which I believe should have a
single heat supply hole.

Well, lets just say that my 67 SC has a 1600 DP w/doghouse and thermostatic
flaps, just as the maker designed for the engine, and it snuggled right up
against the seals just like it should. Now if I can get rid of the big hole
'71 rear tin and get a small hole heat riser rear tin to match my air
cleaner!
