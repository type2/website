The autostick starter can be used, just be forewarned that it has a smaller
solenoid and brushes, besides that, it will work. You were luck to find one,
they are getting harder and harder to find, along with the bug autostick
tranny. Please don't confuse the bus aurostick with the bug. The bus uses a
regular manual tranny starter on the autos from 72-79.

Ok, I made a bit of a small discovery today.  I am in the planning stage of
converting a 1958 bus to 12v.  I started thinking about the starter thing,
and I read somewhere that the 12v Automatic Bug/Ghia trans had a 12v starter
that had a self supporting bearing, and gear, and didn't use the brass
bushing that is in the housing.  Now most people know a 12v stock starter
will not bolt up to the 6v trans without changing the brass bushing.  Now
the last brass bushing that I changed was a SOB to get out (and leaving the
tranny stock is a plus if you're a vintage NAZI unlike me).

So, I called Aut0z0ne the local parts house about 1 block from work.  I
asked them if they had a starter to fit a '71 Automatic bug.  They said yes.
So I drove over, and had them pull out both the Manual and Automatic
starters, and sure enough it was a self supporting rebuilt BOSCH starter.
VERY clean, and very nice gear (haven't tried it yet). So I asked them the
price, it was $5 CHEAPER than the manual trans starter.  I got the starter
for $59 and some change, and I will get a $10 core charge if I return ANY
starter.  That's cool. It also has a lifetime warranty, and I know the
policy works because I've exchanged 3 generators since I bought my first one
in 1993 (Hey, I know it wasn't the EXACT generator that I took in for
exchange, but how was I to know when I have about 5 in my shop).

I hope this little bit of info helps someone else.

Now all I have to do is grind out the bellhousing for the bigger flywheel.

Later
Charles
