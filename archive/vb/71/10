Hey all,

Any idea whether the rear cargo door (not the rear door, but the left =
hand cargo door - as you look it from the side on a LHD model) latching =
mechanism from a '65 can be transplanted into a '63? Did they change any =
of the latching mechanisms in the cargo doors during these years?

Alex
