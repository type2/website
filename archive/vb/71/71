Subject: Lost a hubcap!

  I lost a hubcap today :'(  It looks like I'm going to 
have to buy a set since I won't be able to match the 
grey. I don't know if I can afford NOS (what do they go 
for?)
  Can someone tell me when VW switched from large logo 
to small logo?
  I found Wolfsburg West as a recommended source in the 
archive. Whaddaya think?
