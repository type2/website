Subject: Re: ordering vw part from US to Canada


<<I recently canceled an order from CB perfomance because shipping is too
high, and few of my friends just order stuff from RMMotorworks and were
shocked at the shipping price, even if they choose the Ground shipping, RMM
factured the high rate shipping....

Thats why i usually choose Ebay, its easier to accomodate with the buyer on
the shipping way...

I recently bought someting from BUGCITY.COM and now UPS called me to pay for
custom...arrggg .. i hate UPS !!

Please let us choose who we want to ship... !!!>>

Mike don't rag too much on our US companies.  It's a bit of a pain to ship to 
Canada and the taxes and fees are charged on your end.  Call up your 
government officials and complain.  The free trade agreement is for items 
manufactured in Canada or the US, and doesn't apply to parts made elsewhere.

I try to send most orders to Canada by USPS, but those shipments can't be 
tracked.  The post office says 7 days, when It really may take 4 weeks.  If 
you are in a hurry for the item, UPS may be your only choice.  The postal 
system is more expensive than UPS Standard service. USPS will not ship large 
items we sell like our bike racks and awnings.
