Hi Joel,
If the bus was an Euro delivery then the factory in Germany could have 
installed the radio and antenna or the dealer.  VOA delivery would only be 
both installed by the dealer.  Even when the antenna was installed by the 
dealer it could be installed properly by design.  There were several 
Hirchmann, Bosch, among others that were designed in such a way for center or 
side mount to clear open safaris.  So they required carefull measurement to 
work.   Eric&Barb
