There's a guy on the 911 list that's set up a relationship with a 
testing lab, and has a site set up to archive the results.   He's
still in the 'getting started' phase, so cut him some slack.  His
name is Larry and his email is l_turn9(-at-)msn.com I've sent in 2 
samples from the 911 so far.  I can't remember where the results page
is.
