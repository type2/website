I think it was poor management and nothing to do with VWoA. 125 employees, a
huge mortgage, giant bills to vendors, lifetime warranty issues, mailings,
etc. was there downfall, even with there employee cut backs (payroll,)
another loan, they were still in the red. It's been coming for a couple
years. I hope they pull out, the RMMW show was a blast last year.

ps. VW parts is a tuff business, low ballers, no overheaders, e-bay, etc.
makes it hard to make a living

I was getting 2 catalogs every months or so, unsolicited.

BTW, Bus Depot gets a lot of their stuff from RMMW, and has it
drop-shipped from RMMW, so....

I think the VWOA debacle is what really nailed 'em.

those color glossy catalogs they print, I know I have received about 15 of
these in one year!  I'd be willing to give them all back if it would help
them out.  Seriously though, I'd hate to see them go under (even though I
started to buy all me parts from Bus Depot ;^)
