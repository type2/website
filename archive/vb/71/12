Offtopic praise:  Good for you guys!  Awesome you have such a
relationship, further glued by the common interest in our lovely Wagen's.
 Sure most couples out there either long for such interest from their
significant other, or recognize that they wouldn't have much of a hobby
if there wasn't.  Thumbs up. 

Bus content: There's snow on my '62 bus this morning (this snow was a
surprise here in Grays Harbor, WA) and my main seal mysteriously stopped
leaking this winter.  And the dipstick reads good.
