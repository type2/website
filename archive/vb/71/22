My dot-com sense tells me they won't be the last.  They certainly weren't
the first, although they're probably the biggest.

I am surprised, as I figured they would have had a more substantial financial
back-end, and could have starved out the smalled shops.  They had the market
footprint, but it looks like they were undersold left and right.  Don't get
me started on the service...
