Had to change the subject. I clunk the magnet to the outside of the drain =
plate. It's strong enough to work from the outside, won't fall off and if =
you're doing a quick oil change you can remove it before opening the plug =
so the steel bits flow out. Drop the magnet into the plastic drain =
container to capture the particles for further study.=20

That brings up a few other thoughts... Does anyone analyze oil anymore? =
You could send your oil to some lab and they could tell you if your engine =
was running rich or lean, leaking gas,  smoking da ganja, whatever.=20

BTW, saw a blurb in the news about magnets and carpal tunnel syndrome. No =
effect. A buddy spent ~$200 for magnetic insoles, belts, wrist bands and =
even a truss, I think, to ward off muscle pain on the golf course. Not one =
of the smartest guys I know. But since placebos work 30% of the time....

We have gotten many magnets from this site before and they were very very
strong and dealt fairly with the customer.  They also sale on e**y

We are thinking of placing one on the inside of the drain plate, it is so
strong you will have to use a tool to remove it.  Ours is 1 in x 1/2 in x =
1/8
in thick similar to number 27.
