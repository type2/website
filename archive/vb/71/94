Subject: RE: [VB] Lost a hubcap!

Most VWFLAPS have the hubcap clips. Just from previous experience, try like hell to find GERMAN VW hubcap clips.  The repro ones are pretty crappy IMHO.  On a few occasions I've actually bought clips from a new VW dealer.

I tend to pop my hupcaps off pretty regularly, to check brake adjustment, wheel bearings, seals,...etc etc.  And every repro clip Ive had has broke.  I replace with a German one..and it lasts.

In regards to the rivets..search the type2.com archives.  There are a few solutions to your problem.  Unless you want to be completely OG stock, I've had pop rivets work fine for all my VW's.  I beleive Rex Rogers used small countersunk nuts and bolts.  Anyways...there are alot of options.
