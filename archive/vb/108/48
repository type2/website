Subject: Window scraper woes on 65 bus

I have recently replaced the upper window scrapers (the ones of the =
top/side of the front doors that run through the small metal channel they =
are labelled 211-835 on the WCM site) with new repop WCM rubber.

I have found that with the new rubber scrapers installed the doors are now =
a total pain to open because the rubber binds making it very diffcult to =
open the door without a LOT of force. I have had suggestions such as =
coating the rubber with talcum powder or glicerine (sp?) to make them more =
supple. I have tried both without any measureable difference.

My expereince with WCM repro rubber is that most of it is far "stiffer" =
than the original appears to be and as a result makes door, engine lids, =
rear hatches etc etc far tougher to shut or open. On both of my busses =
that I have installed the repro WCM rubber front door window scrapers on =
results in the door binding considerably.

Any thoughts suggestions besides chasing down NOS rubber?/

Thanks
