Not upset, but your brakes are the _last_ thing you want to experiment
with if you don't know exactly what you are doing.  If you _know_ that
your brake materials are compatible with DOT5 you have no problem, but if
you don't stick with DOT3 or DOT4, which is the fluid they were designed
to use.

BTW, it is true that DOT5 does not absorb water, but this means that the
water will seek out the lowest point in your brake system and stay there.
If the lowest point is below the bleed screw, you will not even be able to
bleed the water out.
