hey everyone-
at kelley park i saw this thing i really wanted to buy, but i went to get
the money but by the time i got back the guy was gone. it was at teh swap
meet, the second or third one on the left against the wall when you walked
through the fence to the second gravel area..the guy was selling a lot of
vintage STUFF, not like parts, just old stuff that would look cool in a
display.the thing i want was on the ground in a wooden baxk that was made
for it , it was velvet lined with spaces for the different peices, thought
it was missing some. the part that was there looked like a clear glass tube
that was about 5 inches long, and at the end it doubled back against itself.
i really want this thing and if anyone knows who that guy was or if you are
that guy (or girl) please email me.
