Subject: Crusty Door Seals

I'm spending the evening (or whats left of it) trying to replace my front
door and cargo door seals.  The old ones are hard and crack when I push on
them.  I can get most of them out, but there is a thin layer of seal/glue
still stuck to the sealing surface.  Is there a good way to get this off
without wrecking the paint?

Thanks,
Isaiah
