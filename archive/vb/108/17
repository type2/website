Subject: Re: [VB] All-Time Favorite Brake Cylinder To Fail Would Be...

Seriously Craig, when is the last time you flushed your brake system?

When I was subbed to the T3 list, there was a guy that sang the praises of
silicone (DOT 5) brake fluid. He states that the non-silicone juice causes
brake lines to corrode, rubber parts to fail and all other types of
frightful things.

Supposedly, once you install the silicone stuff in your bus, it lasts for
ever, even when you let it sit for 10 years or so while Bubba uses it for
target practice.

You do have to flush-out "all" the non-silicone stuff since the DOT 5 fluid
won't mix with the lesser graded fluids.

Try it, and the next time your brake cylinder blows-up, you'll at least be
comforted to know that you wasted a lot of money on brake fluid.

Here is a little blurb on it. Enjoy!
