Michael,

I know exactly what you mean about "stiff" rubber.  It's almost a soft
plastic rather than a stiff rubber.  The stuff I put on my '67 was
shiney, non-porous crap.  It's been a while, so I don't remember where I
bought it, but I pulled it off.  

A few years ago I did a comparison of rubber products from several
sources and found that Vintage Parts in Glendale, CA had the best rubber
both for density and softness.  Not sure if that's still the case, but
I'd start there.
