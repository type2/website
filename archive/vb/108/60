Subject: this list is t*ts

I'm stoked.  I just got a box from Greg Noble that contained 5 little
fasteners.  But let me tell you about these little gems.  I got three
original screws that secure the rear pop out latch to the frame for the 59
double cab.  Mind you that I have been searching for these for over 2 years!
Then I along came a guy (Ben Cooley) whom I believe is a listee or at least
a frequent vwplanet person and he said he had them and would pass them off
to Greg at RedBarn and all for the whopping price of $0!  The other two
screws came from the hazet guy himself, Jon Furst... two 4mm earlier wiper
base hex bolts... I had been tempted to drop some big dollars on some nos
bases just to get the screws and then Jon says he has some.... and the
price?  another goose egg.  Ok, I know someday, my turn will come and I'll
be asked to repay the favor which I will do gladly.

A happy day indeed!!!

The sad part, the dc won't be done by the classic... I'm still missing a few
other odd ball items... but that's ok, I'm willing to wait. :-)
