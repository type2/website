Subject: Paul Williamson AND ethical question...

is Paul Williamson still on this list?

i have a split bench seat for him ive been holding for over two years... he 
sent me money for it a LONG time ago. he's told me at least a dozen times 
he'd come to get it. his email is no longer valid. i cant get a hold of him. 
im tired of holding it and want to sell it.

what you guys think?
