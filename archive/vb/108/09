I bought a couple of those big RubberMade tubs and use a couple of gals of
mineral spirits. After cleaning that way I then use real soapy water and
spray it down with the garden hose and dry off.

If you have the time, simply soak them in hot water and soap.

Otherwise, use solvents made for degreasing

You don't need high temp paint, but if you go to bare metal you really
need to degrease well, prime, and paint to get the paint to stick.  Try to
preserve the original paint if you can!

I have cleaned off the paint is still intact. What is the best way to clean
off the gunk without screwing up the paint....   I'm not looking for a
miracle/mystery product just a way to do it. What kind of degreaser? What
method?
