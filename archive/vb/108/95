I used a sharpened plastic dowel I bought at the hardware store with some
Goof Off glue remover and a lot of elbow grease. Be sure to wipe off all the
elbow grease before applying the new seal glue!

Subject: [VB] Crusty Door Seals


I'm spending the evening (or whats left of it) trying to replace my front
door and cargo door seals.  The old ones are hard and crack when I push on
them.  I can get most of them out, but there is a thin layer of seal/glue
still stuck to the sealing surface.  Is there a good way to get this off
without wrecking the paint?

Thanks,
Isaiah
