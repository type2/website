Subject: Re: [VB] Tires on 15" Wheels -- Your recommendations please.

I run $27 dollar no name passanger car tires in 205/70/15 on my DC.  I've
gone to the dump with the wheel wells well below the top of the rims and
the bed and roof rack packed to the gills with dirt/rocks/and trees.  Yeah,
I'm sure this is not optimum, but I only do it on rare occasions.  The ride
is the best I'v ever ridden in, but I run around empty 99 percent of the
time.
