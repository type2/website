Subject: Front sway bar

Hello, All...
   I have the opportunity to obtain a front sway bar 
(or is it 'anti-sway' bar) off of a dead 1966 Westy bus. 
My question is: (1)would it be a good thing to put on
my '65 or (2)am I wasting my time or (3) go to an 
aftermarket bar?
Part of the question should probably be: does the sway bar
make that much of a difference?
While I'm at it, does anyone make a rear sway bar for
early buses?
TIA...
DUCK
