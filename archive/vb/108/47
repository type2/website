Wanted to offer it to the list before I put it on TheSamba, Ebay, or =
elsewhere.

Interested in selling my '70 Puck camping trailer.  Of the 6 or so I =
have seen it is the second best in overall condition second only to the =
Puck formerly know as Ellis.  Mine has an all original interior in very =
nice shape with solid floors.  Exterior is in good shape with minimal =
rock chips, etc.  Pop top and canvas are in great shape.  I also have a =
Bay window westy tent that goes with.  Hooks up to the drip rail on the =
side and looks like a factory option.  The puck has one replaced side =
window frame, an extra stripe painted around the beltline, and non stock =
wheels.  Stove and Ice box work fine as does the 110 volt system.  I =
have never tried to run the 12 volt system or used the sink.  Water tank =
apears to be in good shape.  All lights work.  The westy tent is in good =
used conditon but need repair to the front screen door.  $4250 takes =
all.  Planning on being at EveryBus this weekend.  Hook up your trailer =
hitch and take her home.   Otherwise the Puck is located in Central =
Florida.  Pick her up and make a vacation out of it.

Call me at 321-795-5003 with questions

Please note:  I am offering something for sale.  I'm not interested in =
starting a Puck bashing thread.  If you are not interested please hit =
delete and go about your day.  If you think they can be found for a dime =
a dozen on every side street in Europe, please go buy one there.  In =
fact, if you think you can have nice ones delivered to the US for around =
a $1K as was stated in earlier threads I'll take 10.  Put up or shut up.
