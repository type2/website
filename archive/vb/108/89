Hi Elliot,
For 1955-late 62 buses use a 205/75R15 tire.  Any bigger and it will not work 
without cutting out the lower & tighter rear wheel wells!  For late 62 to 67 
215/75R15 work with occasional rubbing in the front when in a tight turn and 
you can fit in up to 235/75R15s in the rear!  Main thing is to get tires with 
at least 1525 Lbs. wieght rating.  Anything less will affect not only your 
load capability, but allow your bus to randomly change lanes in heavy cross 
winds!  BTDT, when we used to use 1,200 Lbs. rated tires!  Yuck!
