Hi Al,
That will work fine!  All one really need to know is where 1,500 and 3,000 
RPMs are in each forward gear at what MPH.  Then write this down after only a 
fifteen minute drive gathering this info.

Sounds OK, we get a simular effect in simular weather with broken in engines. 
 Would be nice to know the oil pressure from a gauge though.  The 1641cc 
engine we are using in our 1960 panel camper conversion had too stiff of rear 
relief spring (Aftermarket spring!) in it and we were in danger of blowing 
the oil cooler and/or FW seal due to too high of oil pressure ( We were 
barely able to keep it down to 60+Lbs. when completely warmed up in 70+F 
weather!).

We have found that installing a full flow filter makes a huge differance in 
bearing life.  Even if you change the oil every 50 miles the metal shavings 
just keep going round and round through everything.  We think you will find 
building your an engine on your own will have its challenges, but be well 
worth it if you do it right and take your time!
You are welcome, Eric&Barb

Hi Al,
Well for the next 300-500 miles it probably would be wise to drive it only in 
town for no more than half hour trips.  This helps keep the engine from 
getting real hot which it would do by running high RPM on the highway, and 
with a varied RPM in town polish up the innerds better.

Hi Al,
It really should end up about 2.5-3 turns out for proper running, but 2-5 
will work.  Much more or less than this, you are compensating for a pilot and 
even a main jet of incorrect size.

Hi Al,
Sounds like things are shaping up then!  Great!
