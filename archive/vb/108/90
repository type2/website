Hi Weston,
It is if the oil is super cold, thick and/or super high RPMs.

Rats!

It would be nice to know, but it looks bad either way.

We never had much problem with removing the oil pump.  Though in the 
non-pre-1972 buses VWs you have to work around the rear apron!  You will need 
to remove the muffler and so require a muffler gasket kit for later 
reinstallation.  Most of all you will need a oil pump puller tool so you do 
not ruin the engine case prying on it and scarring any sealing surfaces.

BTW you most likely will have to rap with a hammer on the relief valve plugs 
three times each to work them loose of the corrosion sticking the threads of 
the plugs in place.  Then they should turn with a wide slot tip screwdriver 
easily.
You are welcome!
