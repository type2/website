Subject: looking for something i saw at kelley park

hey everyone-
at kelley park i saw this thing i really wanted to buy, but i went to get the money but by the time i got back the guy was gone. it was at teh swap meet, the second or third one on the left against the wall when you walked through the fence to the second gravel area..the guy was selling a lot of vintage STUFF, not like parts, just old stuff that would look cool in a display.the thing i want was on the ground in a wooden baxk that was made for it , it was velvet lined with spaces for the different peices, thought it was missing some. the part that was there looked like a clear glass tube that was about 5 inches long, and at the end it doubled back against itself. i really want this thing and if anyone knows who that guy was or if you are that guy (or girl) please email me.
