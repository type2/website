NO NO NO NO!

Did I remember to say NO!?

First hand experience talking here.  I decided to "upgrade" my BMW
motorcycle brakes to DOT5.  Worked fine for about a week, then the brakes
started sticking in the applied position.

Seems that DOT5 fluid isn't compatible with many of the seal materials in
common brake systems.  It makes them swell up.

Result was that I had to replace every rubber part in the brake system.
Rebuild two master cylinders and three calipers and replace four rubber
hoses.  At BMW prices this was an expensive lesson!

If you feel the need to upgrade your brake fluid, go to DOT4, which is
compatible with DOT3 but has a higher boiling temperature.  DOT5 fluid is
only for systems specifically designed for DOT5.
