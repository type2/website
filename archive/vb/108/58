Subject: RE: [VB] Tires on 15" Wheels -- Your recommendations please.

>OK I have searched the archive and there are so many posts conflicting on
this subject I need to just ask again. 

And you will receive the same conflicting answers that happen every time we
bring this subject up :)

The same tire is not right for everybody, what do you want to do with the

There was a really great thread on this a few weeks ago.  Look there for
