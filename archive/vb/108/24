Hi Weston,
We doubt it will be a quick fix.  Though have you tried changing oil pressure 
senders to see if that makes a differance for some wierd reason or other?  
Most volks know the first two positions (To the cooler and to the bearings 
directly without cooler.) of the rear relief valve, but not the third.  In 
that position the piston is pressed as far down as possible, and oil shoots 
into the oil sump area through a port in the cylinder wall.  If this spring 
is missing or broken the oil pressure could be going this way.  Then if you 
have a slightly loose sump pickup tube, bad oil pump or partly plugged oil 
passage things just get worse, and worse!  Especially if you live in an area 
with 70+F weather.  Even if it turns out to be one of the relief springs we 
would remove the oil pump and give a good inspection in there.
