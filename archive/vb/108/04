My wheels are on their way to Portland. (My wife is dropping them off at
the powder coaters today.) My tires are ordered and in about two weeks
my early 60 DC should have a complete set of 58 date stamped crows foot
rims, powder coated in either Signal White or Traffic White, with new
205/70/15 Pirelli Scorpian tires. I am even getting a rim done for the
spare tire but I will need to mount one of my thinner tires on it so it
will still fit behind the seat. The truck has been running well and
hopefully will get to make it to some shows this summer. I have never
had a set of powder coated wheels before. Date matched with Pirelli's is
icing on the cake. Now hopefully I don't have problems getting someone
to mount them. I am tingling with excitement.
