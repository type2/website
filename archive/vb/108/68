Subject: RE: [VB] Tires on 15" Wheels -- Your recommendations please.

All right you forced it out of me:

215/75/R15  (some people will disagree and say 205 is the biggest you can
go, your call)

Michelin XCX (Sears/NTB - make sure it is LT rated)
Pirelli Scorpion 
Kumho Venture A/T or H/T

Again make sure the model you get is an LT tire and has a "C" or better load
rating.

Those are my personal favorites...  YMMV

I am looking for your opinions so I can start my search.

I will use the SC for hauling and in-town errands.

Specifically I want a strong sidewall.

>OK I have searched the archive and there are so many posts conflicting on
this subject I need to just ask again.

And you will receive the same conflicting answers that happen every time we
bring this subject up :)

The same tire is not right for everybody, what do you want to do with the
bus?

There was a really great thread on this a few weeks ago.  Look there for
some ideas.
