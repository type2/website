Subject: throwout bearing install...

I'm swapping a throwout bearing. The clips seem to leave the throwout 
bearing with a little play front to back when it's mounted. I tried 
crimping them tight a bit, but it's the little hook the clips have that hit 
at the back that seems to keep them from getting any tighter. Almost like 
they're a tad long there or something.

How tight should that throwout bearing be when it's mounted?

Any other comments here while I'm at it?
