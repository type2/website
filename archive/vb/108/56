Subject: Tires on 15" Wheels -- Your recommendations please.

OK I have searched the archive and there are so many posts conflicting on
this subject I need to just ask again.
I have a '63 Single Cab and I want tires for the 15" wheels.
Any recommendations?  I need brand model and size if possible.

Thanks all,
Elliot
