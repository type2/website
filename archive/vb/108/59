Sheesh, what kinda idjit would own a 65 anyway?

I've got the same behavior on mine, although I *think* it's less of an issue over time.  It's weird - sometimes they stick quite a bit, otherwise not much at all.  Prolly 
temp and humdiddity related.  Scott Kausch trimmed them back on his Binz but went a bit too far, although IMO that's the only real solution -- make 'em shorter so 
they still seal but aren't quite as long.

I'd guess the real bind is the corner, where the edge has to "flip" when you open it and that's where it resists most.  Maybe notch/slice the corner with a razor so it's 
not a continuous flap?  Just an idea for an experiment....
