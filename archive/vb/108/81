Subject: RE: [VB] throwout bearing install... 

Rex,
  It sounds like the problem I had. The bearing 
had "wallered" (Texan speak) out the arms on the fork 
(mine had "sprung" one of the springs). Replace the 
shaft/fork and put a dab of grease where the throwout 
bearing meets the arms, to keep it from wearing so 
quickly.
  Be careful to get a good fork- many rebuilt ones have 
crappy welds (even I could do better!). Also take your 
old one to make sure the grooves for the circlips are in 
the correct location. Do all this and make sure all 
parts/bushings are in place before mounting that d*mn 
spring! Ask me how I know...

I'm swapping a throwout bearing. The clips seem to leave

crimping them tight a bit, but it's the little hook the 
clips have that hit 
at the back that seems to keep them from getting any 
tighter. Almost like 
they're a tad long there or something.

How tight should that throwout bearing be when it's 
mounted?

Any other comments here while I'm at it?
