I don't know much about your engine, but I get a lot of them brought to me
sometime after they rebuild it, with low oil pressure. I find that at least
half of them have pinched oil cooler gaskets or something lodged in one of
the oil galleys.The third possibility is one of your oil pressure or relief
pistons being stuck in the bore. One thing you must do is to make sure those
valves slide up and down the bore easily and that there is no scratches in
the piston valve bore. I air hose out all of my blocks before I put them
back together.

Hi Weston,
We doubt it will be a quick fix.  Though have you tried changing oil
pressure 
senders to see if that makes a differance for some wierd reason or other?  
Most volks know the first two positions (To the cooler and to the bearings 
directly without cooler.) of the rear relief valve, but not the third.  In 
that position the piston is pressed as far down as possible, and oil shoots 
into the oil sump area through a port in the cylinder wall.  If this spring 
is missing or broken the oil pressure could be going this way.  Then if you 
have a slightly loose sump pickup tube, bad oil pump or partly plugged oil 
passage things just get worse, and worse!  Especially if you live in an area

with 70+F weather.  Even if it turns out to be one of the relief springs we 
would remove the oil pump and give a good inspection in there.
