Subject: RE: [VB] Tires on 15" Wheels -- Your recommendations please.

I have had good luck and drivability with my GoodYear PR195-14 tires. I
carry a LOT of stuff in my 67 SC with no problem.

71 Trike 1776cc 32/36 Progressive
VolksAir 1585cc 28 PICT

I am looking for your opinions so I can start my search.

I will use the SC for hauling and in-town errands.

Specifically I want a strong sidewall.

>OK I have searched the archive and there are so many posts conflicting on
this subject I need to just ask again.

And you will receive the same conflicting answers that happen every time we
bring this subject up :)

The same tire is not right for everybody, what do you want to do with the
bus?

There was a really great thread on this a few weeks ago.  Look there for
some ideas.
