Subject: EveryBus, trailer hitch

I have a late bay trailer hitch that I would like to test fit on a '72 Bus.
Is anyone going to Everybus with a '72 that knows they don't have any issues
with the 4 bumper mounting bolts,, that would let me test fit ?

I would even leave it on ,,, and save you shipping!! :-)  or some deal of
such...
any takers? Let me know and I will bring a hitch.

I guess even better situation, is if someone already know this will not work....
