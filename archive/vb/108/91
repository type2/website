Hi Charles,
To the points one would drill holes for and install the threaded mounts under 
the bus.  This kit was SP 248 A, B, D or E depending on year of bus and model 
type.  Best thing is to check out a later bus even up into the late 70s and 
take measurements.  We have cut out these areas out of 70s buses and intend 
to cut and weld them in our buses.  We will even have proper shoulder belts!  
If you do this, cut out big areas due to the large plates inside around the 
nuts to spread the force of the belts pulling during an accident.  It would 
do not good to go to all that work only to have the belts fail from the 
mounting nuts pulling out of the body!
  BTW Vanagon seat belts are easy to get and have the retractable workings so 
you do not have the 70s shoulder belt hand adjust everytime volks switch 
seats.
