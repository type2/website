Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Temps

that is a great picture!!!!!!!!

I'd say look at the scale- some parts of that bug are under 0*C- so think 
that it's taken on a cold day (night).  and the scale doesnot go above 40*C.  
maybe it hadn't got completely warmed up yet.  Think its more interesting to 
compare what gets warm and what doesn't.

 I would have thought the numbers for the hottest part of the engine to be 
closer
 to 100 deg C.
 this is a Bug and will be different, but this seems too far off the data I 
have
 with infrared 
 I use an infrared thermometer when I
 travel,,http://www.metermantesttools.com/products/IR610.asp especially when I
 carabus, as I can take 10 temps when we all stop for gas,,, and I have found 
the
 temps range from 85 - 110 deg C ,, and been as high as 120 deg C 
 I always shoot the temp at the oil galley next to the dist on T1 engines and 
at
 the oil pump for T4 engines,,
 I get temps as high as 200 at the cylinder heads,, 
 I traveled with 10 buses ,, one was way hot, one was way cool,, and all the 
rest
 were the same... from that Data, I came to an unscientific conclusion that 95
 deg C was an average running temp.. up a bit from the year before when the 
mean
 temp was 82 deg C
 
 any ideas ,,thoughts? why that bug engine is sooo much cooler?
