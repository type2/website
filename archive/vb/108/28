Subject: Running now: was pict 30-3 carb issues. Now more carb/temp qs. 

Got pissed at the pict 30-3. Took a brosol, my nemesis carb, rebuilt
it..
Specs now, points perfect at 50 dwell, .016 gap. New plugs, bosch,
gapped each to .28.
Changed oil, this motor has had 5 gals through it in 500 miles. Due to
friggin gas.
Jets, 120 main, 60 pilot, 50 aux/idle. Stock air cleaner for 66. 125 z
emulsion (can't find the 135z I know I will need, hopefully the 30-1 I
just bought has one.
Retimed at 32 at 300 rpm, with about 7.5-8 idle, timing done dynamically
with fancy light.
Drove about 1/2 hour, all speeds. Engine seems a slight bit hot. Oil
dipstick is uncomfy to hold, but doable right after run, and parking.



Engine restarts easily now.

Is this too hot, I mean I CAN hold the stick, but I'd rather not.
Wanna get head temp gauge and oil tmep guage, just to set her up right.
Idle mixture screw had little affect, making me think I need larger
main, smaller pilot?
Anticipating a 55g for pilot, 50 aux/idle/whatever, 125-127.5 main now,
which will proabbly make me need that 135z.

Basically the nature of my q is, based on my description of dipstick, is
this too hot? Cold h20 didn't sizzle off the block.
Since I have that engle 100, I imagine now I need to follow the mutual
advice of the list and get even bigger jets in there, but due to the
nonresponse of the idle mixture screw, smaller pilots, correct?
Still learning, hopefully not by too dangerous experimentation!
