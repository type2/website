If a strong sidewall is what you want, then 14" rims will give you some
choices of D loadranges.  There are several good 195 and 185 X 14 in
D ratings.  I have never been able to find 215 or 205 X 15 in a D
loadrange.  The C seems to work pretty well, but if I traveled heavy
loaded over a lot of distance I think I would go with 14" rims.
Depends on how much load you are going to carry.  Also the 14s would gear
it down some for carrying heavy loads.
