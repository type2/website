Subject: [VB] Turn signal switch 6/8 wire

Hey all,
 
What's the difference between the 6 wire and 8 wire turn signal switch?  My
63 schematic shows a 6 wire setup, but the PO replaced it with an 8 wire
with two of the wires cut and not connected to anything.  Does this work?
 
Also its in pretty bad shape, is it conceivable to take it apart and
re-solder(sp) disconnected wires inside the switch?
