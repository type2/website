Subject: Cut wheel well repair measurements on '61

Hi All,

I checked the Type 2 library and the only article on the subject was a
broken link.  Could someone tell me the measurement from the bottom of
the engine vent opening to the bottom of the rear wheel well.  I've got
the new ones to put in but need to know how far down the flat edge of
the wheel well is from the bottom of the engine vent.  Or how far is it
from the belt line to edge of the wheel well, either one will work.

Thanks,
Aaron
