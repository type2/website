Subject: Re: [VB] All-Time Favorite Brake Cylinder To Fail Would Be...

Thanks, guys, for the observations (and the humor). I was just curious,
'cause I thought it was odd that over the years whenever I've had a cylinder
fail, it's always been the right rear, so I wondered if there was some
inherrent design defect for accidental failure to manifest so consistently
on the same wheel, but in different buses.

I'll have to rule out gremlins, though. I'm thinkin' more along the lines
of...

Sheer Ee-ville.

Possessed Buses. Now there'd be thread...
