Muir says that "the front axle numbers are stamped on the right torsion
arm stop".  But references that help turn a front axle number into a
chassis number range or date are hard to find.  In the '63-'67 Bentley,
and in the Doliwa book through '67, all the front axle changes are called
out by chassis number.  The '50-'62 Bentley has a few mentions of the
front axle number, covering about a two year span:

front axle  chassis  date                 page
   635 004   645 570  (30 August 1960)     V-7 2
   682 051   700 121  (November 1960)      V-10 4
   797 404   829 682  (18 September 1961)  V-10 1
   818 037   851 390  (3 November 1961)    V-10 7
   931 354   971 550  30 July 1962         V-6 6
2 954 889   999 305  17 September 1962    V-5 9

Dates in (parentheses) come from Doliwa; dates without are specified
in the Bentley.

Outside of the numbers game, your best bet is to compare the beam you
have with the Bentley manual to see what changes the beam has and how
they compare to the introduction dates in the manual.  Some of the
vendors on the list have the '50-'62 Bentley manual; it's a reprint
of the original workshop manual and is highly recommended.
