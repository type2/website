Hi,

In the example clipped below, the long number is the wolfgang stock
number. The next sets of numbers are the size the adaptor adapts, in
this case a 5 lug size 112 to a 5 lug 130. The codes before the price
are the vehicle types it applies to, in this case a type 2 1971 and
up.

Hope to see you at Bug o Rama. Where are you coming from?

John

      Is there anyone that happens to know what I am
 asking about, and be able to tell me how to decipher
 the results?  Thank you.  I would like to enter my
 ride into the Bug-o-rama show in Sacramento by next
 show season.  Thanks again for reading, and hope to
 keep the list updated on my progress.
