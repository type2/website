Subject: What a difference 4 years makes

Hi,

I had to reflect and break the silence - just to say that 4 years ago 
this list was awash in flaming witticisms. And this time around, it was 
as if nothing had ever happened.

I didn't put much thought into the last thread about how the list has 
changed - but my, the list has changed. It's like now, I don't even 
know if its Friday or not. (It's not.) I almost put some bus content in 
here just to make myself feel better... I am putting on a disc brake 
conversion after all.

Anyways, just wanted to shout out in my own peculiar way. ;-)

Conrad
