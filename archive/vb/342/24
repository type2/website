Hi,

Congratulations!! Hope you get many miles of enjoyment out of your bus.

Well since you asked.... another reason to keep the jalousie windows, not
only for the rain, but for the screens to keep the bugs out.

Would keep the deluxe trim off.... something I had thought about as well
many years ago. Reasoning was that a pre-'67 complete Westfalia is pretty
hard to find and I didn't want to take away from the exterior
originality..... but the interior fabric,flooring, and curtains changed to
non-stock along with a 1600 DP with minor mods.

Although I did find another way to be creative/decorative on the exterior
.....and have amassed a collection of 38 old travel decals on the back and
wardrobe side window.....

In the end, you own it and you can do what you want with it!

Scott
'67 Westy

want to make this a good strong driver and may veer from originality here
and there for asthetic and useablility reasons.
