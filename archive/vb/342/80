What I don't get is where the heck did everyone go?  Did I miss some 
announcement?  I remember the day Thom sent out that e-mail with 
a link for the scanned image of his vintagebus.com hosting bill 
from AT&T.  It seems like after that, the traffic started decreasing.

If it's because of thesamba.com's forums, I don't get it.  I hate
forums, 
the convenience of getting a daily dose of e-mail from fellow busers 
is somewhat comforting.

Oh - for some content - I've started sealing the wood slats I'm going 
to put on my bus, just in time to start thinking if I should just put 
rhino liner in it instead.  It's a 66 DC, and I'm planning to use it as
a
daily driver, but because I live in Buffalo, I'll need to make sure 
it is somewhat protected from the rust that affects everything up
here.
