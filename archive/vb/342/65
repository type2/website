Subject: Headlight switch

I need a headlight switch for a '63 bus. I have one lead on a guy in Montana,
but I am having trouble getting ahold of him. The newer switches that I make
work burn up. I think I need an actual vintage switch.

I have tried all the on-line VW sources, Ronnie's, Wolfsburg West, Bus Depot,
etc.

Help
