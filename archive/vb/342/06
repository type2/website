Subject: front beam ID

I have a 59' panel that I purchased this spring, and the PO provided a front
beam for it a couple weeks later.
How do I identify the year of the beam that I have? is there a part # or
something that identifies it?
I am a bus newbie, but I have just restored our 73 Super and honestly have
never owned anything but a VW of some kind.
