Subject: Re: [VB] timer switch for heater

ya, there was a stock option to have a timer you could set up to 24 hrs 
ahead... like if you wanted the gas heater to turn on 15 minutes before you went 
out to the bus.   They are pretty rare.   and make an annoying ticking noise.

So does anyone know of any sort of switch that has a timer built in
that I can use to control my gas heater? I have a late bay timer
switch, however this thing is quite a bear to understand. I was hoping
for something to just set the timer and close a contact. There will
not be much current running through it b/c it only controls the relay
on the heater itself.
