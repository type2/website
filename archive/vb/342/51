this bus  and thought "boy, I'm sure am glad I don't have that  problem...."



Hi Clark,
The fuel tank and the sender in it are really easy to just pull, after you  
pull out the engine which is also really easy.  Plus with the need to yank  off 
the external oil cooler and reseal the engine ( plus retorque ALL engine  
fasteners) you need to pull the engine anyway.
