No Quarter....which I always thought was strange because that's a
nautical 
term...and there isn't much sea near Nebraska...

I heard he (like most of us) got really freaked out by 9/11 and
re-evaluated 
what he was doing.  The VW list was something he cut out - but I hear
he's 
pretty active on the buskatiers list.

Speaking of which - I haven't heard much of the kid from Vancouver that

was constantly posting - Kiran I think his name was...always signed off

with That Young VW Guy..

I almost miss those days of lots of e-mail from this list.  Now it's a
trickle.
