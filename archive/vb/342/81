Subject: Head lamp rims 

I bought some rims of E-Bay the adjusting screw holes are in the wrong  
place, mine were 180 degrees the E-bay ones are at 90 degrees. The drain  holes are 
in the right place for a bus. Are one set from an earlier bus?  What year was 
the change? PS its a 66 european bus.  Mike
