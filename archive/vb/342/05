Maybe we should have a compendium of these junkyards and individual
buses for those who are looking for something to restore or for OG
parts. We fanatics could even plan our travel routes to take in these
sights (to the dismay of our kids and spouses). Taking a cue from our
politicos I suggest we call it the "No Bus Left Behind" program.

No, I'm not just kidding.
