Clark,
	I recommend that you leave the windows just the way they are.  As 
you learn more about VW buses, you'll find that some of the original 
parts are useful and even help keep the bus's value up if left in place 
and unmolested.   Things like the jalousie windows, and make sure to not 
cut the dash to make a new and larger car stereo fit!!!!  You scored a 
nice Westy.
