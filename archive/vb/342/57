matt knows of what he speaks! with his infinite (ohms) electrical 
wisdom, i made a HUGE harness that can run 4 gauges and H4s... we got 
some overkill on our wire size - cable is like an anaconda :)  but 
the gauges work flawlessly; before, i would sometimes get electrical 
crosstalk (bad grounds, too many things on one circuit, etc) and the 
gauges would read differently than usual.  if you plan on running 
more than one instrument, i highly recommend the harness route.
