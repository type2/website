Welcome to the list. You should get plenty of opinions here, so I guess I'll go first. Restored means "back to stock".
I'm sure that someone makes adapters but I'm wondering if that would even work to begin with. Have you measured the well to see if you can even get a tire that big in there?  I run 205/75/15 and have little clearance at the doglegs so I can't imagine running a 18" tire.
