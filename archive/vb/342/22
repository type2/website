Clark,
Welcome to bus world and you started it out right by driving the bus 
home and the adventure starts.
Busses do not break down they have adventures!
Your pics are great and you HAD wipers, tunes, and a shift pattern WOW !
The pop outs exchange should go easily, but as a camper the rain does 
not come in the jalousie windows like the pop outs.
The pop outs do seal better for heat and that can be a good thing. We 
like the jalousie windows lots of camping.
Now for the race against the train you will do better not in reverse 
next time!  :)
We do like the paint scheme.
P & C
