Thanks for bringing this to our attention P&C. It's something we''ve
needed to get to and your reminder was helpful.

At the post office the leave board comes around in November, and we
have to schedule all our leave for the entire year at this time.
Otherwise later next year if we want time off we are at the mercy as
to whether someone has the week reserved or not.

Looking over the list, I am concerned that it gets kind of sparse
further out in the year. For example, the Seattle show and Lakeport
are not on it yet. I was expressing to Richard that we are frustrated
because we don't hear about the events early enough to reserve time
off. He said many or most if not all events are the same weekend every
year.

Do you have a date or web site for Seattle? Or do you have a list of
the bus fests for the year? If I was smart, I'd have written down the
ones that just finished, wouldn't I have? John Browns, Bustoberfest,
etc....

We are planning on BBB.

Thanks,

John & Cindy
