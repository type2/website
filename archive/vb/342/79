Subject: Fixing a window frame lip

All,

I am looking at reinstalling a window in one of my vehicles.  It's not
a Bus, but it seems to share the same mounting as the windshields in a
Bus.  The window is square, with rounded corners.  The sheet metal
skins of the door come together to make a lip.  I don't have the gasket,
but I'm assuming it has a groove on the inside "diameter" (quadrameter?)
for the glass and a slot on the outside for the lip, and is installed
like a Bus: put it on the glass, put a string/wire in the outside
groove, and use the string/wire to pull the seal lip over the body lip.

The vehicle came to me with the glass out of the door.  The previous
owner had mounted something in the window opening with metal straps
and about #10 sheet-metal screws.  At the bottom of the opening, he
put the sheet metal screws through the lip that I assume the gasket
seals on.  Am I correct in thinking that this will be a problem for
sealing?  If so, are there any recommended ways to close up the holes?

At the least, I am going to grind down the burrs created around the
holes by the screws, and paint the bare spots.  If filling the holes
is needed, I have considered using RTV or similar goop, Bondo, pop
rivets (but if they end up with a hole in the center, I'm back to
the same problem), or trying to braze the hole shut.  Do any of
these sound more likely to work than the others?

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
