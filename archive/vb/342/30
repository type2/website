Hi All, 

Thanks for all the fun responses!  I hear ya loud and clear.  I read your messages aloud with my girlfriend in the room and she's saying "ok, keep the windows.  Getting her to camp is going to be a struggle, but my 8-year-old is another story.  I'm going to ease the girlfriend in to just going to the beach or the races and having a place to get out of the wind.

I'm very interested in what you guys are doing for engines and transmissions.  My bus did 65 to 70 the whole trip, but I've never experienced being peened around by trucks passing me at 80.  I don't know what I can do for stability, but I felt like I was on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride much of the time.  Believe it or not, I got used to it and learned to time the repelling and retraction that each truck brought with it.  There is a lot of slop in the steering, so  I learned to start all my steering before the crosswinds actually  happened.

This bus has an uncut dash, which was a nice surprise.  I want to find a period radio, so there will be no cutting I assure all of you.

The mystery that remains for me is one related to my serial number.  I looked through David Eccles book and found that all 1967s started with 217.  Mine starts with 237.  So I don't know what to think.  The plate in the front matches the stamping by the engine, the M plate is all there.... You guys probably know.

Thanks for the kind responses.  You sound like a fun, helpful group.

Clark
