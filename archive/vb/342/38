Nice bus!  looks like a 67 from the rear hatch/engine lid/reverse lights.   
you may have the 67 gearing... which I'd find practical with a 1600, then again 
I'm happy doing 60-65 mph.   driving faster than that tends to overrev and 
cause an engine to run hot.  myself I like an oil temp and pressure guage.  
Helps me know of problems before it gets expensive... and when to slow down 
especially when it's hot out.

pros on the louvered windows:   nice cross ventilation (good for cooking in 
the bus, or camping in the summer) and you get bug screens... you can have them 
open in the rain and it wont drip into the bus

con:  they can be tricky to get to seal properly... might rattle/be a bit 
drafty.  i know someone who did plexiglas in the screens for anti-draft 
protection.    maybe have 2 sets of screens?

Me i'm not big on trim on non deluxes

with the steering in good shape it should be good for freeway driving.  Get a 
John Muir 'Idiot Book' and follow the directions in the 'shakes and shimmies' 
chapter to identify what is wonky under there.   sometimes something as easy 
as replacing a tie rod or drag link can make a huge difference.   the Bentley 
is excellent as well.

all 67 buses have the 2x7 xxx xxx VIN number.   the 2nd digit indicates the 
model...
 so 217 xxx xxx is a 67 panel, 227 xxx xxx a 67 standard, 237 xxx xxx a 67 
kombi, etc.  
Westys were made on kombi, so your VIN makes sense.   I find the SO-42 westy 
kit very practical.  Enjoy!

How's the heat?

Hi All,

Well, I bought a Westie and managed to get it home:

http://homepage.mac.com/clarksville/bus_odessy/PhotoAlbum20.html

I'm new to buses, but I've been playing with cars for quite some  time.  I 
want to make this a good strong driver and may veer from originality here and 
there for asthetic and useablility reasons.

My girlfriend doesn't like the looks of the jalouse windows, so my first 
question is:  can I assume if I find a set of pop outs they will fit right in?  
Will there be any modifications required?

I really like the look of the deluxe trim.  Will people make fun of me if I 
put deluxe trim on a Westie, or has it been done before and that predicessor 
taken the heat already?  I don't want to be drummed out to the vintage VW groups 
for sacrilage.

Thanks much!

Clark
