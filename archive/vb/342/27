Hi Clark,
We did not catch what year your Westie is, though from the pictures it  looks 
to be a 1964-67 model.
While we love a perfect VW restoration, for the pre-1968 bus as a  daily 
driver, one has to modify.  If you are interested we can Pmail  you our modified 
tranny history, and engine upgrades.

>>  My girlfriend doesn't like the looks of the jalouse windows, so my first  
question is:  can I assume if I find a set of pop outs they will fit  right 
in?  Will there be any modifications required?   <<
It depends.  If the hinges and latch plates were installed at the  factory 
for pop outs you will have no problem.  If not you will have some  cutting and 
welding in your future.
  If your girl friend likes it really hot while sleeping and getting  eaten 
by night time insects when you do pop open the pop outs for the  much less 
ventilation they give.  Then get rid of the jalouse windows,  and the screens.

>>  I really like the look of the deluxe trim.  Will people make fun of me if 
 I put deluxe trim on a Westie, or has it been done before and that 
predicessor  taken the heat already?  I don't want to be drummed out to the vintage VW  
groups for sacrilage. <<
Personally we would go without the deluxe trim.  If you really like it  get a 
deluxe!  Also you will need to invest both time and $$$ into  making your bus 
a reliable ride.  Figure a minimum of $2,000.00 to  just get a properly 
rebuilt engine, tranny rebuilt into a freeway flier,  and another $1,000.00 for 
brakes, electrics, suspension, etc..  Then more  for body and paint!!
