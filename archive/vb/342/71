Subject: Are they still available?

To the bus list members,
     First introductions for the newest members of the
list.  My name is Aubrey Allen from Northern
California.  I own a 1959 Volkswagen Type II
Transporter Crew Cab Pick-up.  I have modified it by
installing a super bug's transaxle, a 1600cc
singleport with stock VW Type II exhaust, 14in bus
rims, with 205/75/R14 BF Goodrich tires.  The body has
doors from a newer bus, angle iron reinforced side
gates from the previous owner, and I unbolted the
front window frames to make them removable for those
warm California days.  The rest of the body is stock,
the rest of the suspension is original with rebuilt
reduction gears.
     Second the question.  This winter I am in a
position to restore my truck completely.  I would like
to install 18in alloy wheels.  I have found the rim I
like.  The tire I have picked has a load rating above
1576 lbs.  The wheel and tire shop will sell me the
rims, but they are a Chevrolet Car Bolt Pattern.  They
are willing to sell me the rims and tires for an
estimate around $2700.00.  My question is therefore,
are the wheel adapters for changing the VW bolt
pattern to the Chevy Car bolt pattern still available?
 I searched Wolfgang International's site to help
support their business, and these are the results:

      Is there anyone that happens to know what I am
asking about, and be able to tell me how to decipher
the results?  Thank you.  I would like to enter my
ride into the Bug-o-rama show in Sacramento by next
show season.  Thanks again for reading, and hope to
keep the list updated on my progress.
