Subject: Re: [VB] What a difference 4 years makes

For me, the economy has taken it's toll. I don't have the free time I used 
to have. I have to work more with less days off.

The time I do have I spend keeping my house going and spending time with my 
family.

So VW's have taken a BIG back seat for the last year or two. Really sucks.

I made a point last night to go out to my shop and spend time with my 
single cab. I've got some money saved so will start buying sheet metal to 
fix it up better.

On that note, I'm on the hunt for some '59ish rear truck corners. Need the 
whole damn corner section....especially for the passenger side.
