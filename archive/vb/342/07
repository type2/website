I don't think that BMW ever modified a VW bus with a front opening 
hatch.  Also, if they did, which side would they open from?  Something 
to keep us all up at night thinking about......

I think that there is great beauty and dignity in these photos of 
decomposing buses.  Some of them could have been saved at some point but 
they are now all dissolving away together.  Great photos!  Gary Gibson
