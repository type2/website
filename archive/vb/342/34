Hi all,

Last week I wrote that i liked the BA6 gas heater (belly mount), except that
it still relied on engine rpm for output. I think I may have been wrong, as
this morning when I got off the freeway, I all the sudden heard a loud
whirring noise. I thought it was the big ol jeep wrangler sitting behind me,
but when I got to work, the noise was still there and went away when I
turned off the heater. I turned the heater back on, and there is a very
large amount of air blowing out of my defrost vents now, we're talking the
same amount that blows out when flying down the highway. And this was while
sitting at idle.

I'll check it again later today to make sure i'm not crazy, but it appears I
may have given some incorrect info and wanted to make sure I corrected that
with anyone that my have read it. It appears I may have a bum fan on my BA6
that now appears to be working (hopefully through the rest of the winter!).
If this is the case, then this is a superior heater to my old SW heater
IMHO.

Again, my apologies for any incorrect info I may have given.
