Subject: Re: [VB] Time switch for heater

I had a switch in my old '70 that had a green face. It worked as a timer and as a regular switch. Just a quarter turn to the right than the heater would come on and I could turn it back to shut it off. If I went beyond the "quarter turn" it would start to wind up, kind of like a small oven clock timer. I think it was about 1/2 an hour than as it reached the end it would turn off. 
I'm not all that familiar with late buses but I know t3's had an actual clock timer in the clock on the instument cluster. If late buses had them as well, I'm sure they are pretty rare. 
Have you posted this question on www.thesamba.com in the Baywindow Bus forums? I'd start there. I'm on there "sometimes" as crofty. LOL I'll take a look in my literature and see if I can come up with anything else.

Do the late bay gas heater switches really have a timer on them? If mine has
a timer, I have no idea how to use it. Got any info on it? How I use it,
what it does?
