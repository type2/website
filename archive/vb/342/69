Hi All -

Matt Roberds' wise advice on wiring a cht gauge:
"..The signal coming from the thermocouple that mounts on the head is on 
the order of a few thousandths of a volt at a few thousandths of an amp, so 
it is much less tolerant of bad wiring."

leads me to say:
After running a cht gauge for a while on my new stroker motor, I replaced 
the plugs and so had to wrestle the sender back into place between the #3 
plug and the head.  The sender (and it's special braided wire section) 
wanted to twist as I torqued the plug.  Finally getting it properly seated, 
I was surprised to see temp readings noticeably higher than before - 
depending upon air temp and load conditions as much as 30F degrees.  I'm 
assuming it's the difference in the final contact, magnified by the 
relatively low signal vs. relatively large 'sweep' of the gauge needle.
