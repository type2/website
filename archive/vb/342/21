Subject: Got my Westie

Hi All,

Well, I bought a Westie and managed to get it home:

http://homepage.mac.com/clarksville/bus_odessy/PhotoAlbum20.html

I'm new to buses, but I've been playing with cars for quite some  time.  I want to make this a good strong driver and may veer from originality here and there for asthetic and useablility reasons.

My girlfriend doesn't like the looks of the jalouse windows, so my first question is:  can I assume if I find a set of pop outs they will fit right in?  Will there be any modifications required?

I really like the look of the deluxe trim.  Will people make fun of me if I put deluxe trim on a Westie, or has it been done before and that predicessor taken the heat already?  I don't want to be drummed out to the vintage VW groups for sacrilage.

Thanks much!

Clark
