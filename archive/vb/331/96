Subject: 63 singlecab 1 tomn great! thanks clara & ray

Finally my daily driver has become a wonderful daily driver  again.
Clara was staying with me and adjusted the brakes again. I  sort of felt it 
necessary when the brake pedal stuck down a couple of times.  well I needed new 
seals and shoes all around. But the rear drums were out of  spec.
 
We got new drums from Wolfsberg West and now I have probably  the only 64 
singlecab with the 1 tom option that has the one year only big drums  on the 
small nut tranny that are NOS!
 
Well, Volkauthority had to cut the drum off and I will put a  picture on my 
website.
So the brakes are now fixed but the noise has become terrible.  I put it up 
on stands and drove it around 60 mph and there was no noise, so the  noise was 
the front wheel bearings.
At least these are all years and Ray at Volkauthority replaced  them and now 
the radio does not need to be at max volume.
 
My daily driver 63 singlecab is a pleasure to drive  again.
 
I guess that these little things will happen if you keep  putting miles on a 
40 year old vehicle, it will need critical parts  replacing.
