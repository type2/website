Archives, schmarchives... I don't check no stinking archives.
I do think less people are daily driving splitties now.  :(    I don't 
understand why people think splitties are expensive, though.   I have heard people 
say this, but don't understand.   
I guess I if I did/paid for bodywork/paint I might think so :)   But to get a 
bus into driving condition, if you are willing to do the work yourself... not 
too bad.  Paying someone...  yup that'd cost a bunch.  lots of little stuff 
is easy though.  


no trip report for you guys till next week.

   It's a matter of dollars. Splittys and there related cost have priced most 
people out of them and the new people can getting 
into buses afford bays so buy them instead.
  Splittys have become more of a weekend, once a month driver when they used 
to be daily drivers for a lot of people and these seem to all own bays now.
I watch the post and would say it's the same people answering the same 
questions for the last few years.  
Then if a newbe ask a question a get hammered to check the archieves   New 
knowagable people seemed to
have been chased away by the regulars.
