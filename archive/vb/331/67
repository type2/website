Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Filler cap gasket

I bought a whole sheet, probably 12" or 14" wide and a coupla feet long
for a mere $8, from Napa, of a rubber impregnated gasket material. 
Perfect for this application...

I've used it successfully to replace the gasket on the whatchamacallit
for my fi.  ;-)
