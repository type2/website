Subject: oil cap question

due to the temporary sanity of a list lurker, i acquired a tiny part 
of his stash, and found a neat part i'd like help identifying... it's 
a cap for the oil filler neck; but unlike the simple stamped tin ones 
that say "oel" or "oleo," this one has a VW logo and the word "kombi" 
in raised lettering. any idees what years/ makes?
