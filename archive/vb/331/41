Subject: RE: [VB] 2nd gear pops out

Hey everyone, I've been away from home for the holiday weekend, so I didn't
get to properly thank you all for the great information and advice you've
given me on this problem. Ronnie, I'll be giving you a call soon to get this
process started!

Thanks again everyone!
