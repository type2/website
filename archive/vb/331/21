Hi Mike,

For any doghouse cooled engine you MUST use a 33, 34, or better yet a 35mm 
wide (inside measurement).  You need to use the largest diameter lower stock 
pulley which almost always has a "D" stamped on one of the pie shaped 
corrigations of the pulley.  Using a Porsche 356/911 upper pulley increases fan speed 
more.  Tach your VW for a fifteen minute drive to find out where all four forward 
gears hit 1,500 & 3,000 RPM at what MPH in each gear.
