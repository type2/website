I went to a bunch of self-serve yards in central Calif today. Slim pickings.......  but I did see a bus
waiting to come out at the Modesto Pick n Pull. It was a 67 Kombi or Standard. Unfortunately, it is a complete
burn job :-(

From what I could of it, it was two tone: bright orange bottom, white top. No wheels. No windows, the fire
took them out.

Does anyone on the list know of this bus?
