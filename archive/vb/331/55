Subject: re:broken brake return spring

I had a similar thing happen to me-or at least it sounds like it.

I had done some work on my front end, and repacked the front wheel
bearings.unfortunately I overtightened the nut when returning the wheel.

The wheel bearing exploded, and melted to the spindle. First I heard a loud
nois then shortly, not sure what it was-but shortly thereafter the front
wheel kind of felt like it locked up.

When you push and pull on the tires is the bus jacked off the ground?

I also had the brake return spring break on me-although this is the one in
the pedal cluster. No symptoms like you describe. 

Good luck diagnosing-and let us know what you find.
