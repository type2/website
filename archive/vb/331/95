The carb works on the volume of air pulled thru the venturi. All the 
jets do is make sure that the air fuel mix is correct.

I will admit that the newer carbs are jetted a little lean for my taste.  

According to Bentley:

main jet 117.5
air correction 135z
pilot g60
pilot air 150injection tube 50
power jet 75

These specs are for the 30 PICT-1 on a 1500. Should work on your 1600 
without a problem.
