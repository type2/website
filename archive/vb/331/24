could you measure a lower "D" pulley and let me know how large the largest 
diameter is?
I want to see if any of mine are. I dont ever recall seeing a D stamped in 
one.
thanks.  <<
Hi Andy,
Did a quick tape measurement of the pulley on the engine in "Nermal" our 1960 
walk thru panel camper conversion, it looks to be  7-1/6" (179mm) diameter 
edge to edge.
