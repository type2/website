Subject: Re: [VB] Friday: VW Bus defined

I'll contribute to the "lifestyle" theme with a report, that another Canadian 
is happily on his way after a 3-night stay at our place. Matt, former graphic 
designer and now an artist, drove his '78 white and red bus down from up 
North to roam free. The bus is his first ever vehicle, having had it for only 90 
days so far. We met last weekend in Jerome, where I left him my contact info. 
Then his clutch cable broke about 100 miles away from us. So we had the 
pleasure of hosting him for a brief period.

Matt has only just left our yard after the minor R&R, heading towards the 
Monument Valley and then Arches NP today. Then he plans to go through Bryce and 
Zion, then thru Nevada into Cali by the way of Tioga Pass. While he's in orbit 
I'll be the volunteer ground control and relay any request of assistance if 
necessary. 

It is a lifestyle for the lucky few, that I concur!
