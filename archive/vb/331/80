Subject: front emblem seal question

Here's a question to the list from a lurker.
On my recently acquired new single cab I pulled off the front emblem to buff
out the nose.
The original seals came off and desintegrated.
What are people doing for replacement emblem to body seals when installing the
emblem.

Wolfsburg West and WCM do not have the seal.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Dave Barnes
