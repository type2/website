Subject: cough ... choke ... fast idle cam

Volks

What makes the fast idle cam on the choke return to its
choke off position? Is it just the counterweight, or is
there something else?

Carb is a new Brosol 31PICT. The choke seems to work OK.
It's set so that it only closes partially and the fast idle
cam only moves to the second step on cold starts. The
bi-metal spring opens the choke butterfly within a couple of
minutes, but the fast idle cam does not return, and usually
moves the other way, so the idle starts to race. If I move
it back by hand it stays there until the next cold start.

Anyone experienced this? Suggestions for a fix?
