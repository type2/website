Subject: Re: [VB] Gas cap

Hi Paul,
The OG 1955-67 gas cap has the VW emblem taking up almost all of the top of 
the cap.  The skin of this cap is made of aluminum, and the venting of the cap 
has some steel in it and is crimped into the underside of the cap.  The only 
way to see the venting itself is to pry the cap apart, ruining the cap....
