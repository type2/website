Subject: e: [VB] More 40hp (1200cc) parts needed. (and questions)

Eric, Barb.

Thanks again for the help and to the rest that emailed
me.  

I have the lower pulley situated.  I found a larger
one in my stash that i will use.

The intake manifold i need is for a 34mm              
     intake opening.  Not sure which rev manifold that
is.  I think the "D" rev.  (Anyone have one that is in
good shape?)

The other part i was after was the steel adapters that
go into the fresh air units on the muffler and up thru
the rear tin.  They then accept the paper tubes that
go up to the upper fan shroud.  I am not sure if these
are reproduced.

The last bit i am struggling with is adapting my 12V
generator to the fan housing.  I am pretty sure i just
do not have the right parts yet.  Should there be any
issues mounting a later generator (No mount for the
regulator) to a 40HP stype fan shroud?  My current
issue is the bolt pattern to mount the generator to
the mount plate and the order of assembly.

Thanks again for the help.
