 Here's my .02. First off I don't buy the "Splits are easier to work on" line. If anything rust has a little longer to set up on a split just because of age. It's also a lot easier to find bay parts compared to a split; not to mention a lot easier on the wallet. 
 I'm on both "forums" (the Samba and here) but I don't post all to often here anymore. I like this list and I have met some real great people here but the "other" site is a lot more direct when it comes to answering questions, especially technical. I remember when this list was a lot more active as well and it would jam my in-bin almost everyday. My biggest complaint is that the difference between a post that started out as "what is the timing on my 010?" and what the content of the last post was was a total 360. I can't tell you how many posts I have deleted without reading the whole thread because the subject matter had changed at least 3 times from the original topic.   
 That being said I have met a lot of great people on this list (Ricky, Ronnie, JP, Jon, Dave B, Rachel, Harry, Karl, Beto, Tom B) and some more that I hope to meet in the future (I guess I need to make a trip to Utah!).
 It would be nice if there was a way for listees to meet at shows for a picture, poker game or even a friendly match of indian leg wrestling to settle an old argument!
