Subject: Re: [VB] front emblem seal question

If I removed an emblem to buff a bus and the old seals were bad, I'd take a 
bicycle inner tube, cut a circle, and with a hole punch make a hole in the 
middle of the circle.  Or they probably sell things like that at a good hardware 
store, so they'd be cut nice & round rather than my sad pathetic imitation of a 
circle.  yup, I'm sure they sell them at hardware stores.

Here's a question to the list from a lurker.
On my recently acquired new single cab I pulled off the front emblem to buff
out the nose.
The original seals came off and desintegrated.
What are people doing for replacement emblem to body seals when installing the
emblem.
