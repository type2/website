I've had my split (first air-cool) for little over1yr now, and 15,600
miles. It is my daily driver. I bought this 67 std off the Samba, with a
blown engine. I like this list so much!! You good people have helped me
with kindness and knowledge. I do check the archives repeatedly. I do
lurk here and will keep on has long as it last.
Thanks,
