Subject: 30 Pict Jets

Can someone tell me what jets are the correct ones for a 30/31 Pict 
(dual idle jet / new Brazilian) running on a stock 1600 with a '62 stock 
air cleaner?  Or, how about a link to a Solex book or manual.  I 
remember long ago someone posting a link to one, but of course I can't 
find it now.

Thanks!


Steve
