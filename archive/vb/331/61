OMG! OMG OMG OMG! A SALE ON JUNK?!?!?  IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD!?!?! Where is
it at? Got a name or address for 'em? I'm goin'! I'll stock up on stuff
I don't need YET! :)

Anybody else need anything while I'm their?  Send me what you want
looked for and how much you'll pay for it, and I'll see what I can do.

Cheers
Chris
