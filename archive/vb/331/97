Subject: Re: [VB] 30 Pict Jets

  I just did a new Mexi 1600 and installed the 30/31 with the adapter. I never looked at the main but it has  what ever 
they come with when new. I had to change the main pilot to a 55 as I was getting some lean pop at higher rpm's. It 
also has a new 034 Bosch single vac dizzy.  Other wise it is a bone stock engine. No dyno test on it so I'll have to wait 
till the owner installs it to see how well it runs under load
