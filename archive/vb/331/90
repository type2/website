Subject: Re: [VB] knocking, and more friggen knocking!!

Hi Josh,
It does sound like a loose rod knocking.  So it probably is time to take the 
engine apart and do a rebuild, before all heck breaks loose in there!
  We just autopsied an engine that had a rod come loose.  Looks like it had 
been rebuilt less than a thousand miles before the destruction.  The hole 
through the top of the engine case was just about big enough to put a fist into it. 
 The rod as it bounced around in there also hit the camshaft and shattered it 
into four pieces.  This in turn shattered off the tang off the oil drive 
gear.  Plus huge gouges in the interior of the engine case and several shattered 
tappets.  Yum!
