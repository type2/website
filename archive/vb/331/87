Subject: RE: Listees

Glad I received good responses regarding the difference in the two lists-- I
do subscribe to both, and learn from Both. My two buses are splitties and no
where near stock. I am very hesitant to ask questions because of the
flames--of which Bessie my Grateful Dead bus and The Silver Bullet, my
flamed pick-up that has been shortened 4 feet---Seem to get the dander up on
the Vintage Volks ,  but I drive and enjoy just the same  and the American
Street Rod club that I belong to--loves the cars--seems my 3 VWs are enjoyed
more by the Non-VW crowd --??


I did help the cooling on my shorty bus by installing a 200mm lower pulley,
the increase in fan speed made the difference. If anyone is having heat
problems in their bus, give the 200mm pulley a try--It worked wonders on my
bus--, TWWM, uj
