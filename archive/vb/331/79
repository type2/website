Subject: Gas cap

I have a repro gas cap that if I run a seal in it I get vapour lock.

So I am after an original bus VW logo cap - I see a few of these at the swapmeets, but they are never cheap - how can I tell that they are definately split ones?

Is it possible to see the vented part or is it within the crimping?

Thanks
Paul
