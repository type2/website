Subject: Vanagon Bentley

While traveling this past weekend, I came across two Vanagon Bentleys 
at a junk shop.; one is in never-used, mint condition, the other is 
slightly used.  The covers read... "Volkswagen Vanagon:  Official 
Factory Repair Manual: 1980...1991, Including Diesel, Syncro and Camper.

In anyone is interested in one of these manuals, please email me off 
list.  I wanted everyone to know about them before I put the on The 
Samba or the auction site.
