Subject: Fouling Plugs?

A friend and I are starting to try to get his 1600 dp to daily driver status
after sitting for a while.  When he first got it, he saw it run somewhat
decently.  Then we pulled it out, tore it down to a longblock to clean and
replace a few things like intake boots, few seals, etc.  At the same time, I
did a quick rebuild on the carb (my first carb rebuild, may have screwed it
up somehow?).  Adjusted all the valves, then we put it all back together
with a custom exhaust (straight pipes).  Now it won't run for more than
maybe a half hour before it fouls the plugs to the point of not running.
Anybody have an idea?  Thanks.
