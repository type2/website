Subject: re:steering lock

i dont know anything about steering locks, but "to drive" in german is
fahren, so fahrt is some conjugation of it...basically it is probably where
it  wants to be when you drive.

this translation is approxiamte-so those of you more fluent than i please
correct as neccessary
