Subject: Surface Rust

Last night I just got my '62 EZ Camper!!! I can't wait to dive in. I do need 
some constructive advice on getting the surface rust taken care of. In 
general the bus is very straight. I have found only one square inch of 
cancer rust on the drivers side dogleg! There is surface rust on the roof, 
inside walls floor pan, edges, etc. What products would you suggest that I 
use on the rust? Is there a process that works well? Web sites with tips? I 
was thinking that I would use phosphoric acid to start, then sand out the 
rust spots and lastly spray primer over the spots and later on have it 
painted professionally. Please let me know any successes or do's and don't 
that you would suggest. I'd be stoked!

Thanks in advance,
Joshua
'62 EZ
