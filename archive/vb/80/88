Subject: oil temp circuit

Hey all,
last week someone asked about a simple oil temp circuit, or was it the week
before. Anyway, I have one that I have been using on buses and bugs for
years and it doesn't take much to hook it up. The neat trick about it is
that it uses the standard oil light on your instrument cluster, no other
displays necessary.
