Subject: Torsion Bar set screw, lock nut torque

Hi,

I replaced my torsion bar seals on one side and am doing the other one 
tomorrow.

1. I didn't see a torque rating for the torsion bar set screw and lock 
nut. I used 25 foot lbs. for both.

2. Can you replace the 'snubber rubber' without having to take apart the 
torsion arms? I had to take it off before I could get the torsion arms 
back on. I didn't realize the other side has a cracked 'snubber rubber' 
and don't want to get everything back together only to have to remove 
everything again.

Thanks,
Conrad
