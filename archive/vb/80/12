Subject: Needed DELOG windshield,,,Thing ? and Tour box going west?

Hey folks couple of things , A local guy needs a DELOG  windshield  for p/s
, all i have are either fogging, seperating or wasted anyone have one they
would part with ?
Also this is off topic a bit i need to know the orentation of the last bow
in a thing top and the distance between the 2 round tubes the straps attach
to. Can anyone help with any info on that?
 I got an E-mail from Britt  and if he comes to EveryBus campout/ Road Cow ,
i'm Hoping to get the tour box carried to the west coast for awhile and let
ya'll  have a turn. Anyone against that?
Thanks in advance
