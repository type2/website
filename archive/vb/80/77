Subject: Balancing connecting rods

Hey everyone,

This ought to generate some interesting discussions:

I'm in the process of balancing the rods for the 1641 SP CW
engine for my 63 Standard. I'm using the balancing instructions
in the Muir book (the instructions in the Hi-Performance Section,
not the ones in the rebuild section). Does anyone have a
procedure that they follow to do this? I have a bench grinder
(actually a kitchen counter grinder ;^), and a triple beam
balance that a friend lent to me. I've almost got the big ends
balanced, then I'll do the small ends, and finally try to get
overall weights close. From what I've read and heard from local
reputable builders, big end is the most important since it has
the highest rotating speed, but I'm anal and want 4 perfect rods.
I know it'll drive me nuts after a while, I figure 4 or 5 days at
2-3 hours per day and then I'll just accept what I have. I'm
trying to build as balanced an engine as possible, with a CW
crank, dynamically balanced to flywheel, clutch, and pulley,
balanced rods, pistons, and wrist pins. I can't wait to start
measuring deck height, head chamber volumes, and crank end play.
Hopefully, this will be a slow-drag competitor! hmmm....guess I
need to get an early SC or DC to really be competitive there, eh?

Any tips, hints, suggestions, are more than welcome!!

Thanks,

Alex
