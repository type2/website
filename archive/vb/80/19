Subject: Identify this NOS part.

I have a NOS piece of sheet metal for some type of VW that i have no clue
what type though.. Basically it almost looks like a rocker panel for a
deluxe bus with the trim holes drilled into it. Heres some pics of it

http://thesamba.com/vw/htmlscript/gallery.mv?search+Kirin%20Jacobsen  It had
the original parts numbe sticker on it. it says Volkswagenwerk geproft
831803766. It also has another Invoice thing on it. that says
Support 2604 0129028.
I was given this piece for free. I have no clue what it is it for and it
definitly doesn't fit my bug... Hope you can help me..
