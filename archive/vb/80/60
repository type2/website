Subject: [BSKA] Check out my new bus


   I picked up another bus today, it's a 1960 kombi/truck powered by a old
Chevy iron duke engine. A true piece of make what you got work (watch out
Road Cow). 
   I'm putting the pics on the planet tonight, excuse the contrast as it was
dark when I got home and got the pics.
   The whole story of how this bus came about will be up on
www.volksrescue.com  as soon as I get a copy of front page


ronnie   another 1960 to the collection
