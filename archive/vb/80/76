Subject: '60 Westy for sale

I picked up a '60 Westy project this weekend along with a couple other
Buses. The plan was to get some parts, but a deal was struck and I ended
up bring home 3 Buses as well. I don't have the time for another project
so I'm looking to sell it. It was a project that someone started and
never finished. All body work is done arrow straight drivers long panel,
90% of the interior is there but needs to be restored, it's a runner /
driver (need glass, and rubber installed), rust free, blah, blah,
blah.......

I'm asking $4000 obo for it. Pictures can be seen here...........
