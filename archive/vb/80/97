Somebody needs to invent an e-brake club for the bus, but then a good thief
would just cut the e-brake cable, but it would discourage the less
knowledgeable thief.

at least I won't have to worry about somebody stealing the fugly bus!

Is it just my imagination or has there been an dramatic increase of thefts
going on in my neck of the woods(Orange Co.)??

The camo DC, the white bug at OCTO, and one or two others are just recent
examples.  Then, last night I opened the garage late to put the truck in
and was greated with a truck door slaming and a newer blue Ford crewcab
speeding away.  Sure, could have been a neigbhor, but I asked and they
wern't expecting anyone.

Since I'm having to drive my truck on a daily basis till my water pumper
gets back, I'm going to start being more careful.  Till I get a gas shutoff
at the tank, I'm using my low tech pull the rotor, and a few fuses
technique, any other ideas?  I guess I really need to spend the bucks on a
locking shifter.  Should I spend the money on a Berg, or will one of the
less costly bug ones work?   How about that brake "club" like device thats
all over infomercial hell?  Anyone tried one on the verticle pedels of our
busses??
