Subject: Working 63 singlecab & almond blossom pics on site.

I just got back from H*me D*****t with a load of plants for the garden & 
boxes for packing stuff.
I was unloading the truck & saw that I was in front of the almond tree in 
bloom
I was also using the treasure chest to keep stuff out of the impending rain, 
so here is a working type2.

My 63 singlecab page has been updated with a couple of pictures.
