Actually, the Transvair kit is still available.

Visit Clark's Corvair Parts (-at-):

<http://www.corvair.com/power.html>

The downside to the Corvair conversion are fairly serious. All caused by
the backwards rotation of the engine...

1.) Flopping the ring gear:  Results in the transaxle operating in the
reverse of its designed direction. Therefore all the stresses are
applied to places in the case not designed to withstand them.

2.) Reversing the rotation of the engine: Requires a replacement of the
camshaft.  Big problem here is wear on the distributor drive.  The
reversed rotation causes the force on the distributor to be up rather
than down. THis results in rapid distributor wear. I've heard reports of
worn out distributors in less than 1000 miles.

The "proper" course of action is to replace the entire VW drive train
with Chevy parts.  For ease of installation, the two speed Powerglide
auto is probably the way to go.  

FWIW, I have scans of the Transvair catalog and installation guide for
download at:

The files are big (1-2mb each), so be patient.
