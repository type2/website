Subject: Re: [VB] Surface Rust

After sanding, I suggest using a product called "Ospho". It's an inexpensive
and fairly easy to find "rust-eliminator" product. I've never searched for
anything else off the shelf, but I know this works. There are others, I
think, but definitely use a rust eliminator before primering.
