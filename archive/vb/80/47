How difficult was this tank swap?  Any reason why a later tank would not
fit?  Like from a '75-'79 fuel injected bus?  I keep looking for good bay
window tanks but all the local wrecking yards started spiking them for some
reason thus rendering them useless.

We are using a 6 volt gauge with a 12 volt 1968-71 sender in same years tank
with no problems in our 63 SC.
