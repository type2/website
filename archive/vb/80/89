The Bosch Part Number for this kit is:

1237 010 007

Check with Ronnie at Oldvolks.com.  He should be able to get this kit,
which is essentially the metal and fiber washers and a few other hardware
pieces.  In fact this kit was originally produced by Bosch for the two
distributors that you are trying to rejuvenate.  Bosch added a few other
doodads to the kit when the later distributors appeared in the 70's.

Good Luck
