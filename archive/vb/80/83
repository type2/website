Subject: RE: [VB] Balancing connecting rods

How about balancing your piston weight ? What about deck height on the block
for each cylinder in reference to crank center. How about the actual height
of each cylinder. Have you honed and decked your lifter holes ? Are we up to
$3000 yet?

Or you could just carefully put it together and hope that VW's 65 years of
experience counts for something.

Are you using a counter weight crank?  More important than balanced rods,
IMHO.
