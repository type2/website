Subject: Re: [VB] Stolen VW's

Well, I've had a vehicle stolen before (not a vintage VW, luckily) and it
sucked. I got it back, and I asked the guy..."What about a Club?" He took
me over to a car that had just come in (stolen) and pointed to the back
seat. A nice new Club was sitting right there. He said...That's what
happens withmost Clubs.

Well, I went to Pep Boys, or Kragen or where-ever to see what was out
there. I found that for an extra $10 I could get a self-locking Club. That
means that I can just slip it on in a couple of seconds and not have to
hassle with my keychain to lock it on. It's on until I get back to the car
and then have to hassle with the keychain to remove it. BUT at least it's on!

Now, when I told people I was getting this I heard a lot of "youknow those
are easy to break right? all you have to do is spray some freon in the lock
and hit it with a hammer and it's gone." Well, I'm not worried about people
who carry around cans of freon...the Club works because of the hassle
factor. Friends always laugh when I pull into a parking lot and park next
to a Lexus/BMW/Mercedes/Whatever and slip the Club on. BUT if the criminal
sees cars with Clubs and without...which ones are they going to consider first?

That's my extra $10 worth of input!
