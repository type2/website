Not true for the 002 and 091 trans. They were never installed in a bug.
What you say *is* true about the bus gearboxes with reduction gears
though. (pre-68) The '71, which is the topic of the original post, uses
a 002 tranny and no reduction gears. Now if you were to put reduction
gears on a 002 trans... (Do they make 1:1 reduction gears?)
