Find your wiring diagram at http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring .  For
your '71 it looks like the three rightmost fuses are all switched with
the ignition (circuit 15).  I would probably connect it to the rightmost
fuse - the one for the turn signals and some of the dash indicator
lights.  Like Joel noted, circuit 15 is all over the back of the
speedometer - it is the black wire on the generator, oil pressure,
and turn signal lights, and on the fuel gauge. 

If you don't like to splice, your FLAPS or hardware store should have
"doublers" that have a push-on socket with two tabs.  Put a push-on
socket on the wire to your gauge.  Then you can unplug the original
wire from a tab on some component, put the doubler on the tab, and
then plug the original wire and the gauge wire onto the doubler.

There are also splices with a slotted metal blade inside a plastic
housing.  You put two wires under the blade and squeeze it down with
pliers to make the connection and then fold a plastic tab on the
housing over the whole thing.  These work kind of OK for low-current
things but not so well for things that draw a lot of juice.  If you
remove it later, it leaves a cut in the insulation of both wires.  
I personally only use these kinds of splices for very temporary
hookups or in emergencies.

If your oil gauge has a light in it, you may want to connect the light
wire to the dash light circuit so you can dim it.  The dash light
circuit, 58b, is the gray/red stripe wire at the instrument panel
and the light switch.

Good luck!
