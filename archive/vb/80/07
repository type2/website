Whats the difference between hawking your "special", "over stock",
"just-in" "gotta clean out my garage" part listing and an E-bay listing???

If one gets booted for the latter....why not the former?  Don't get me
wrong, I love seeing all the new stuff and great deals some of our members
provide. 

Just a question to the elders, since the swift sword of justice was weilded
recently (just saw Lord of the Rings...sorry) to someone who crossed the
"line".  For a moment there I thought Ken was at the helm. ;-)

Yours truly,
