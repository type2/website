At the risk of offending you.Fix it.

If all this was happening and you did nothing that is your main problem.Get a wiring diagram from Thom's site and check and clean all connections in the system,correct the problems ,add grounds to the tail lights and enjoy a working bus.Also read Matt Roberds flasher instructions and you should be in the clear.

This is a good time to buy a test light and a volt meter if you do not already have one.

One of the first thins I do with a new to me bus is get the brakes and electrical sorted prior to putting an engine in it.Easier to do the rear electrical with the motor out.

Since I've had my bus on the road, this has been the lighting scenario:

Day 1 - left low beam out, left brake light works, tail lights works, no blinkers
Day 2 - tail lights work, no brake lights, front right turn blinker comes on with brakes
Day 3 - left low beam fixed, right low beam out, no tail lights, right brake light works
Currently: high beams work, no blinkers, tail lights fixed, right brake light works, front right blinker comes on with brakes

Mind you, I've done nothing significant to the wiring while these conditions were changing. I fixed my tail lights last night at the bus club meeting before driving home....thanks Nick for holding the flashlight!
