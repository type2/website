Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel sender question...

Hi TJ,
We have used 6 volt senders and guages on 12 volt.  You just have to make 
sure the wiring is nice and tight.  We had a ground on the sender come loose 
and allow the gauge to peg up and down as it loosened.  Finally broke off the 
needle in the gauge.  We are using a 6 volt gauge with a 12 volt 1968-71 
sender in same years tank with no problems in our 63 SC.
   As far as your pegging the fuel gauge now:
Is your fuel tank full?
Do you have a bad sender?
Shorted through wire between the gauge and sender?
Did you mount the gauge with the bracket upside down shorting out the sender 
wire?
