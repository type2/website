Subject: Re: [VB] 21/23 Split manual question

For the '67s there appear to be two manuals.  A fellow on eBay sold a
mint condition '67 deluxe owners manual last year and it went for around
$140.  The cover photo was tinted an orange-yellow color, I believe. 
Whereas with my '67 doublecab I got a commercial manual (cover bus looks
like a panelvan) that has a cover photo tinted blue-green.
