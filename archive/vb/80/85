Since I've had my bus on the road, this has been the lighting scenario:

Day 1 - left low beam out, left brake light works, tail lights works, no =
blinkers
Day 2 - tail lights work, no brake lights, front right turn blinker =
comes on with brakes
Day 3 - left low beam fixed, right low beam out, no tail lights, right =
brake light works
Currently: high beams work, no blinkers, tail lights fixed, right brake =
light works, front right blinker comes on with brakes

Mind you, I've done nothing significant to the wiring while these =
conditions were changing. I fixed my tail lights last night at the bus =
club meeting before driving home....thanks Nick for holding the =
flashlight!
