That is what I have heard as well.  Besides how would you start the thing if
all you did was reverse the ring gear?  I think that Rex should put that
corvair engine into his Thing;)

Hi Volks,
We also have heard that for the corvair engines one can get a special ground
cam to make the crank and all run the same rotation direction as a VW
engine.
