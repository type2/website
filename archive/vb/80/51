Subject: Re: [VB] pre 59 turn sig. switch colour question

Hi Adam,
Our APR58 bus parts manual lists two colors of turn signal knob, both of 
which have type 1 parts numbers.  For the casing of the turn signal switch, 
there are three switches listed all with type 2 part numbers and no colors 
mentioned.  So it is likely that the switch colors up till then at least were 
black.
