Hi Bus driver,
Do not use WD-40 since it will just rinse out the tar.  If the inner rubber 
flange looks like it is seated inside, it is probably as good as it will get 
right now.  The main problem is your rubber seals are extruded in a straight 
line and then expected to take to sharp corners close together in your bus.  
Take a cooked noodle about 1/4" wide and 1/16" thick and try to make a 3" by 
4" rectangle out of it with only 1/4" radius corners without wrinkling the 
noodle in the corners!  With time they should mold more to the body shape, as 
we have found out with split screen rubber when glass had to replaced, but 
the rubber was still in good shape.
