First I would like to thank Matt for the excellent reply to my post
about blinker trouble. Using your post as a guide I got my blinkers
working today! Turns out my switch was dirty and not making contact.
Thanks Matt! My next question is where does the horn wire go? I look
underneath at the steering box but I don=92t see a hole. I have an
indentation about =BC of an inch deep right on very bottom of the box. =
Is
that it with a load of crud inside? I tried blowing compressed air down
the hole from the top and that was a HUGE mistake. It blasted out the
top all the gear oil that was inside. So, any tips on where to look for
the horn wire hole? And any suggestions on what to refill the steering
box with?
Thanks!!
TJ
