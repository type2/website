Hi Thomas,
The 1968-71 tank swap was pretty easy.  The parts that took a little time 
was:
1.  We made a pair of brackets to make the original straps still work without 
modifying them.  That way in a pinch we could install an earlier tank if 
needed in no time at all.
2.  Took an original tank neck (From a rusted out 67 only tank that rusted 
out only next to the outlet due to water traped by the stock tall outlet 
pipe!  The rest of the inside surface of the tank was rust free and still had 
ink manufacture marks on the inside!) and cut it to change the angle of the 
pipe midway so as to keep the rubber fuel tube as straight and unstressed as 
possible.  Also took the time to weld a home made grate made out of steel 
into the neck nearest the tank.  Anyone trying to use a garden hose to siphon 
fuel will be unhappy with the results.  ;-)

The 1968-71 tanks have a bottom nearly the same as the pre-1968 ones.  The 
72-79 have a totally differant bottom and need some conversion way to seat 
them on the flat earlier sheetmetal.  We have heard of others using a couple 
of boards to do this.  Even then we are not sure they will seal to the body 
hole that the outlet tube needs to go through.
  If you want a tank put in the word to one of your local wrecking yards that 
you want one and will pay $20.00 for it and visit them often over the next 
couple of months.  Or find a hulk out in the woods for the tank.
