Hi Thomas,
Try:
http://hometown.aol.com/veewee111/index.html
and please tell us if this website of ours works.  We are still trying to 
figure out webpage design.  The pictures show:
1.  The cut and angled inlet/filler tube to the tank.
2.  Our 1641cc SP CW engine that has pushed us around for over 50,000 miles 
so far with no major problems.
3.  The inlet/filler tube top to the tank is now about 2" taller than stock 
and due to this the gas does not as often seep out of the gas cap when the 
tank is full when parked.
