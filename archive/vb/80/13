Hi TJ,
Look for a plate on the underside of the steering box.  There should be four 
bolts holding this plate in place.  In the center of the plate should be a 
hole (Probably plugged with gunk right now.) for the brown colored ground 
wire to pass up through the steering column to the horn button.  There should 
be also a be a tie down bracket to hold the ground wire to the bottom of the 
steering box to help keep it from flopping around and getting torn off.\
  As for filling the steering box with lubricant use 90 or at least 80-90 Wt 
gear oil same as the GL-4 stuff you used in your tranny.  If you box leaks 
this gear oil you need to mix a STP additive (Check archives for 
recipe/ratio.) to the gear oil to thicken it just enough.  Late in split 
screen production VW did use grease mixed with kerosene to keep the grease a 
fluid even at low winter temps  We are not sure of the longevity of this 
latter mixture due to the kerosene evaporating out over time.  
   It is a good idea to drain the steering box of old dirty oil/grease with 
shavings and can be done by loosening the previously mentioned plate with 
four bolts just enough to allow it to at drain and leave it for at least 
eight hours (Even longer in winter weather!) before retightening the bolts 
and refilling.
