Subject: RE: [VB] CB Radio antenna

Joel,

I am lookin' for one also.  You see, I was big into CB's like 10 years ago,
and I still have my set.  I did some pokeing around, and found this site:
http://www.eburg.com/~trsradios/

I have never even inquired this site, so I don't know how they are, but it
is a start.

As far as brands, I remember the K40's are one of the brands to get, but I
cant think of an antenna mount.  Anyone?  I'll hopfully be on the road this
spring, so a CB will be handy, if not entertaining!  Back then, I spent
hours talkin'.  I'm cross posting to the wetwesties list, to see what
discussions happen...

The trip is on...
