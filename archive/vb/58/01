This seems to happen a lot.  Out of my fleet of
busses, three were titled to the wrong year when I got
them.  Apparently (my theory, here), my 1957 Singlecab
got a new nose skin when brand new, and was titled as
a 1958.  I redid the title without relinquishing the
original, and was able to change that one to the
correct year, but my 1959 Westy is still titled as a
1960, and the '66 Westy that I gave to my daugther for
her college graduation is titled as a 1967.  (It's for
sale, BTW.)
