Subject: Re: [VB] holiday gifts (friday)

I bought bugster preasents for its anniversity- when I had had it for ten years it got new shocks, brake hoses, new taillight lenses and I finally fixed the reverse lights.

For my 61 15 windows 40th birthday last year (april 11th) I drove it to the Kelley Park/ Red Barn events- about a 2K mi round trip the way I did it.   I had shortly before finished putting a rebuildt tranny in it, but that was just a maintenance thing, not a present.
