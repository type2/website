I gave my bus a sweet paintjob. :)
I gave my Rabbit new shoes.
I gave my GTI a week off.

since it's friday, i thought i'd post a question that i've been
wondering about
the last few days:
how many of you out there are planning on getting a holiday gift for
your
volkswagen(s)?

Ellis sez:
I'm giving mine the week off but would love new mirrors for my F-150!
