Subject: Vw Art

From time to time I have seen "art" designs using Vw parts,, kinda like the
muffler men statues around the USA.

I was hoping to find pictures of Items that have been made out of Vw parts and
end up looking like something different.

Can anyone point me to a web page,, or send me some pictures of Vw part art ?
