Subject: Westfalia Roof Rack restoration tips

Well, I finally bit the bullet and traded for an original Westy rack to
complete my project. Missing two clamps, needs new wood, and a couple of the
bent tubes straightened. Why I didn't buy one of these in the early '90s
when they were half the price escapes me. Anyway... tube straightening!

The trick is to rebend but not kink the tube. Having said this, the 1/2"
aluminium tubing is pretty tough and will not bend that easy anyway. One
suggestion was to fill the hollow tube with sand and put between two blocks
of wood and screw down some C-clamps to get small bends out. Good idea, but
the tube will slip out of the wood blocks when the clamps are tightened.

Next try..... drilled 1/2" hole into 6" square block of wood. Oil tubing,
and slide in, readjusting bend with spark plug/wheel lug "socket" from VW
factory tool kit. Works okay, but with some restrictions in that end tubes
are slightly bent in original form anyway and will not go all the way thru
the block if you bend is in the middle.

Finally, pulled out old Black & Decker Workmate (portable clamping bench
wonder of the '80s) and set it up in the basement. Perfect for the job!! It
has a groove in the middle of the wood that is used of clamping that runs
about 3' in length. Slip tubing into the length of this groove and tighten
her up. Adjust with socket as required.... works beautifully with no danger
of kinking.

Have done half of the polishing on the uprights and tubing with Dremel/Wet
sand paper. Hope to have the whole thing done shortly..

Merry Christmas to all!
