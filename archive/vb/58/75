Is this one where the tab pulls out and you flip it over to switch from 6v
to 12v?  Sometimes they are hard to pull out.  There is not usually anything
inside to switch.

I'm not sure what the button is, got a pic?  It could be an AM/SW radio, so
the other button may be for Short-wave(SW).

I'm not sure where to look for more info, other than:

Hiya list

Someone gave me an early Blaupunkt Radio today.  It can be either 6 volt or
12 volt I think because it has this tag on it that shows a switch in either
a 6 or 12 position.  It is currently in the 6 position and I can't easily
get it to move to 12.  It has both knobs and it is missing one button.  It
has one button that has a music sign, another that says "OFF" and the third
is missing.  Anyone know where I could find one of those buttons or what it
said?  Am I  right that this is either 6 or 12 volt depending on the
position of the thingy or is there something inside that has to be changed?
Is there anywhere I can look to find out a bit more about these?
