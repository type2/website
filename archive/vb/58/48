Subject: rolled 50's Double Cab!!!

While cleaning out my wife's Grandfather's house after he passed 
away, we found this article clipped from the local paper for Elgin, 
Texas. After doing a little research with some of the sports info on 
the flipside of the clipping, I aged it at around 1968. Where's that 
double cab now!!!

Here's the link: http://www.type2guy.com/dcelgin.jpg

p.s. We have absolutly no idea why he saved it. He wasn't a VW guy 
and there weren't any other articles or anything of that sort. It was 
under some clothes in one of his drawers. Makes you wonder?!?!?!
