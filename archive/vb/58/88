Subject: Round Tuit, Merry Xmas

Howdy,

Merry Christmas to all and a Happy New Year too!

Someone finally gave me a Round Tuit. I started removing the nose metal on
my bus. So far I have drilled all the spot welds on the driver side
including around the wind shield area. I expect to be working on it some
more tomorrow. Anyone wants to stop by and see the progress/wants to see how
its done, Pmail me.  I am in the Torrance, CA area.

Chris,
The Steering Man
