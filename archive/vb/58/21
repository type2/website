All,

Here's an email I wrote about the preheat tube on my '64 (with '68 Bug
1500).

I have a '64 Standard with a 1500 from a '68 Bug.  My (metal) preheat 
tube is on the left side, taking air from the fins around the rear of
#4.  A flexible hose runs from the pipe, through a hole in the tin
on the left, under a clamp behind the crankshaft pulley, and over
and up to the right-side air cleaner.

Here's how I'd reproduce the preheat tube I have.  Get a piece of about
0.5"/1.3cm copper pipe or electrical conduit about 4"/10cm long.  Cut
one end at about a 30 degree angle to the pipe cenerline - in other words,
one end of the pipe will be an elongated oval in cross-section.  Top

Get a small piece of thin steel, about 1.5cm wide and 10cm long.  Drill
a 10mm hole in one end.  Clamp the other end to the pipe with a worm
gear clamp, and bend the steel at a 90 degree angle to the pipe.  Or,
weld, if you have the equipment.  Top view:

Put the hole at the top over the lower left muffler mounting stud
after the muffler flange is on, and put the nut down over that.

I hope this helps!
