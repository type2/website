Hmmm, very interesting...

My '67 DC has the preheat system I described, versus getting preheat
from the heater boxes.  I had assumed it to be correct and original. If
your info is correct, I would have to guess that when the first owner
back in Calif. replaced the engine over 20 years ago (as best as I can
determine) he also switched the heater boxes to ones without preheat
outlets.  He certainly did plenty of other screwy things which I
belatedly discover from time to time.
