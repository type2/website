Some things are best left alone. Let's just say that I
sacrificed my buses for a new baby and cash flow. Nice trade...

Been there, done that!!!
In the end, buses (and F-150s) are toys. Kids and family (although they will
drive you bonkers when they are teenagers <g>) are forever.  There will be
plenty of time to play with toys later when there is better cashflow and
when the kids get older.  There isnt a better trade out there!!!

Merry Christmas to the entire list!!

older)
