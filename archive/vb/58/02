I didn't look at the page, but if you are talking about the part of 66/67 pre 
heat system where the tube from the air cleaner goes forward along the right 
hand side of the motor, through the tin in front of the fan housing, and then 
into the heater box, yes you need the heater box with the pre heat outlet on 
it.  I have seen lots of these, often plugged if preheat pipe not used.

Seems a good idea, as the pre heat air is under pressure from the fan

 I am referring then to part A56, seen in action on scan 195. Where does
 this metal tube go? Does it just pick up air coming from past the heads,
 and that is it?
 Is there anything but the weight to worry about in the aircleaner?

 the aircleaner, the weighted flap, and a hole in the tin. Hose is easy

 but what is UNDER the tin? I suppose there was a different heat
 exhanger?

 Hi AL,
 Go to vintagebus.com, check out the 1958-67 bus part manual in Obsolete
 Air-Cooled Documents.  Go to page 143 and take a gander at part figure
