Subject: Louvred Windows

Hi List,
Just finishing up my 67 sundial.  Stripped it, had it painted, new
rubber, safari windows, etc.

Question though.  My camper has 2 Louvered windows, along with 4
pop-outs.  When I removed the louvered windows, it looke like someone
had simply put a bead of caulk around the window on the inside, where it
comes in contact with the body.  There were no rubber seals or anything
to keep the windows from leaking.

Now that I am re-assembling everything, I realize that I didn't get new
seals for the Louvered Windows.  Did these windows get itstalled with
only a bead of caulk around the inside edge, or were they sealed with
Pop-out seals, or what?  Any help would be appreciated.

Thank you,
Ed Richardson
