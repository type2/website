Subject: Camper? Now *THIS* is the bomb! quasi-nonvw content

In previous years we have been seeking a Dormobile (VW) of our dreams that
never happened. During that time we met folks who had these Dormobiles. With
the big engine, endless amnts. of cash for rarest of the rare parts and no need
for airconditioning or longazzed commutes-THIS would be the bomb. Would give up
my F150 and FJ60 for it. <sigh>
Anybody have post dotcom riches to spare?
