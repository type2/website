Hi Kevin,
That is what we are using in our 1960 panel camper conversion!  We ran the 
cable to it through the driver side forward door pillar and drilled a hole a 
few inches to the left of the upper air intake.  There is a magnetic base for 
these that seems to work great if you want a movable CB system from VW to VW.
