Subject: Re: [VB] Blaupunkt Radio

while we're on the subject of blaupunkts, i have an late 60's early 70's 3
band that needs a new/replacement on/off/volume switch. everything else
works excellently, but when turned on, the volume is very loud and does not
get louder or softer. can anyone recommend a good repair shop that i could
call/email for this repair?
