Subject: holiday gifts (friday)

since it's friday, i thought i'd post a question that i've been wondering about the last few days:

how many of you out there are planning on getting a holiday gift for your volkswagen(s)?

historically only about half the time i get something for my vws during the holidays.  however i almost always get something (doodads or maintenance related) for them on their birthdays.

last year all my running vws received holiday gifts but i actually only provided one; my single cab got its new bed welded in place.  my beetles received gifts (very nice) their from someone other than me and a bus lover at that!

cheers,
