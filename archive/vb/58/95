Subject: help with M-code plate

I just signed up with this list, I have been a list member on the Type2 and 
Vanagon list for sometime now. What brings me to this list is I discovered 
an old split window camper that appears to have been abandoned. I found it 
when my dog got out and I chased him around the neighborhood and low and 
behold three doors down in the backyard of the house behind it is this red 
and white camper. I went back today and got the numbers off the M-code 
plate. I deciphered it the best I could and was hoping you guys could 
correct any mistakes I made. It reads...

02 05 0

374 A23 168 181
UL 231 SK 654C 602487

My understanding, and please correct me if I am wrong, is this

2 May 1960
374 ?
A23 SO-23 Westy interior
168 88 amp battery
181 Chrome hubcaps
UL  USA don't know port
231 Kombi, RH cargo doors, LHD
602487 VIN

I am not sure on the paint codes but I think I got everything else. If 
someone could look over this info for me I would appreciate it. If any one 
has any comments on this model year I would like to hear them before I try 
to acquire this bus. It is in need of a restoration, the passenger side 
doors have been left open, there is no engine, and the wheels are half sunk 
in the ground. All comments welcome.

Thanks,
Nathan Wood
