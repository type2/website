I have only seen the body numbers of use for curiousity.   FWIW on normal 
(not many option- the mass produced version) the body number is very close to 
the VIN.  On buses with wierd options, or deluxes etc, the body number is off 
from the VIN significantly like yours.  Implies to me the body number is 
stamped near the beginning of production, VIN near the end, but its just a 
guess as to why
