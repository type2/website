Subject: [VB] rolling survey..Re: [VB] Re: rolled 50's Double Cab!!





     I rolled my first bus, a 66 walk through panel w/ camper windows cut
in. fell asleep for a sec at hwy speed and ran a light ripping the front off
a little import and
 rolling my bus a couple of times.  I fliped the next bus, or rather had it
 fliped when pulling into a friends driveway. I got rear ended by a mini van
 going 45 mph. wedge shaped nose went right under the bus and fliped me
over.
 that one was a 66 deluxe 13 window.
