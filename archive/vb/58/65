The KISS principle applies here.  The longer the antenna, up to a 1/4 
wave whip, the better for your already meager output.  Many people do 
well with a 4' or 6' Firestik antenna from a truck supply shop.  You 
can spend a lot of $$$ on fancy antennas and do no better.

Installation is important, as the antenna needs a good ground to work 
well.  I put mine on the roof rack, and grounded the roof rack to the 
body at two points with copper strip.

If you just want to keep in touch when in a busavan, it makes a lot 
more sense for everyone to get one of those little FRS handheld 
radios.  They work better and there's no installation involved!
