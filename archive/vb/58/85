Subject: Engine on Stand

Is there a time limit that one should keep a fully assembled engine with
fan and exhaust on a engine stand.   Is it likely to crack the case at
the mounting points since it is only supported on one side??  Guess I
could support it with a 4X4 for long term storage.


Happy Holidays everyone!!
