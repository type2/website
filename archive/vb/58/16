I'll go ahead and chime in as well...

I graduated college this week (hooray) and my fiancee bought me a new set 
of front seat covers for my '63 Riviera.  But these are special...they're 
custom WCM seat covers (with pads) in red with white piping to match the 
rear seats in the Bus.  I haven't even seen them yet and I think I still 
need to go buy a hog ring kit for them, but I'm super excited to get them 
into my camper around Xmas (and super excited to no longer sit on springs 
covered by a $40 Pep Boys seat cover)!

Merry Xmas All!
-Taylor
