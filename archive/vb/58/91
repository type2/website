Now, that I can do...
Blaupunkt will accept it for refurbishing.  It's not that much more than another shop.

However, another shop suggestion would have to be Pyramid Audio.  Pyramid is Not a specialized
service center for Blau, but with that old of a deck, I don't think they'd have all that much
trouble with it. Do not confuse Pyramid with the aftermarket audio company with the poor
reputation.  These people have NO connections to them.
