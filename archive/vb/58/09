Subject: re: [VB] holiday gifts (friday)

since it's friday, i thought i'd post a question that i've been wondering about
the last few days:
how many of you out there are planning on getting a holiday gift for your
volkswagen(s)?

Ellis sez:
I'm giving mine the week off but would love new mirrors for my F-150! ;-0
