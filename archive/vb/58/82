Current ad on VWPlanet "Trade 65 bus for empi polish 5 spoke" last photo on the
right shows a bus in the back ground (blue metalic latex painted 69 Westy) that
I sold out of Phoenix, AZ last Spring/Summer. hahahahaha At least it isn't a
grey barndoor pop-topped ambulance camper. =)
Merry Christmas to everyone.
