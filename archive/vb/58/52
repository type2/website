there was a joke in the 50s... "his mother was frightened by an edsel when
she was pregnant with him!" usually meaning the guy was  a) ugly or b)
hated fords. variations on that theme abound.

perhaps your mother was at that corner when the accident occured, thus
programming your genes for bus-ness!!
