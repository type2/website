 Hi Everyone-
 
 I have the "T" number for my 65 bus- I want to get a key cut for it. Does 
anyone have a lead on someone that can cut a key based on a "T" number alone?
 Thanks

A good locksmith can.   Cost me $15 plus tax to get a pair of keys cut to 
code.  I have done this for a number of splitties,   they have books with the 
codes in them.  Worked great.
hint- go to a locksmith that has been in business for a while.
