Just wanted to say that THOSE "mechanics" will NEVER work on my bus again ..
I just wanted to let them know that it is STILL leaking oil .. or maybe it
is coming from the tranny .. couldn't smell the difference, I am a smoker,
maybe that has something to do with it .. Every dime that goes into that bus
in the next few months, that is related to the engine, I will be taking them
to court to recover.  The way I look at it is, I worked hard to make the
money that I gave them .. and they did NOTHING to earn it ..Diane
