Subject: help major oil leaks!!!

I just went through 6 liters of oil on the way to work today and was 
wondering if anyone could telp me identify the problem.   the oi seems to be 
coming from the above the oil sending unit behind the carburator and its 
just pumping down and running down the  left head.  Is there an oil line up 
there maybe under the engine fan tin?   thanks in advance.
