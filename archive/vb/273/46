Subject: Re: [VB] Official name of the Single and Double cabs

Craig is right on the first, single cab being pritschenwagen.

Double cab was actually reffered to as "pritschenwagen mit dopplekabine" in the early years. (plank
bed car with double cabin) But from what ive seen they just used doppelkabine for short after that.
