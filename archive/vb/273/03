Subject: RE: Are keys the same

As a registered locksmith (and bus owner), I've got to disagree with a 
recent post stating that the only correct way to code cut a key is with a 
pair of clippers.  Astually, a much more accurate way is with the use of 
dedicated code cutting machines.  The do use a cutting wheel, but are 
micrometer controlled.  When properly used, accuracy is easily within .002", 
and frequently tighter.  Clippers cannot maintain this accuracy.  I keep 
clippers as a secondary code cutting implement, but primarily use an HPC 
1200 code cutter (a $3500 machine) as my primary method of code cutting 
keys.  There are several other machines of that type available, and all do a 
wonderful job when properly calibrated and operated.  A code cut key 
generated with clippers is generaly fine, but I must disagree with the 
statements made in the recent post.
