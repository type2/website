Subject: Re: [VB] turning drums (was:stuck drum again)

Hi Volks,
We have seen some of the madness caused by modern day drums.  Eric 
volunteered one day a week to work at the now long gone "Wolfburg Warehouse" owned by 
Bill D in Seattle.  A VW reapair shop was run in the back by Jack.  This place 
was full of shelfs of NOS stuff from WWII thru 1979.  Bill D had connections 
all around the world!  One day Eric was in the shop and saw a fellow tossing his 
old bus brake drums in the scrap 55 gallon barrel.  Eric asked if they were 
bad drums and the fellow said he just wanted new drums instead of those old 
ones.  Next the week Eric is back in and sees this same fellow emptying the scrap 
barrel to get to the bottom.  Turns out he is looking for his old drums 
because the new front ones the bore for the bearings was to big that the bearings 
moved around in them causing a horrible rumbling sound through the bus.  
  So this and from the experience of others makes us lean toward not just 
having our drums turned unless absolutely needed.  Even then we request the drum 
turner to take as little as possible even if it means a bit of the drum is not 
completely cleaned up.
