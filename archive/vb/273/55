Is this related to the idea that a 55-66 MC in my 53 meant the pedal was 
really really hard, then when I got a bd MC (19mm if remember right, I know the ID 
was smaller) the pedal had a nice, appropriate, amount of squish to it.

???????????

<< Hi, John and the List...
 You can play with values in this formula for a simple 
 brake system to see how they effect each other:
 
 F1       A1
 __  =   __
 F2       A2
 
 whereas:
 F1= Force, in pounds, applied to master cylinder
 F2= Force, in pounds, being applied to wheel cylinder
 A1= Area of master cylinder piston, in square inches
 A2= Area of wheel cylinder piston, in square inches
 
 F2, the force being applied to the wheel cylinder is what we
 want to find out...
 
 OK, let's plug in the following info: for  A1> 22.5mm master cylinder
 (or converted to .636 sq.in.).  for A2> 22.5mm wheel cylinder
 (also converted to .636 sq.in.)
 Apply 100 pounds pressure for F1,      and F2 would be......
 100 pounds!
 
 OK, let's adjust the info: for  A1> 24mm master cylinder
 (or converted to .724 sq.in.).  for A2> 22.5mm wheel cylinder
 (converted to .636 sq.in.)
 Apply 100 pounds pressure for F1,     and F2 would be......
 87.85 pounds  !!??!!
 
 Thus proving that "bigger isn't always better!"
