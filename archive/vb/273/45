and then you need to take into account that the 72 and later was 
designed for disc brakes in the front and have a totally different bias then 
a non disc brake cylinder, thus creating more pressure to either the 
front or the rear (I don't remember which way) but have heard stories of 
the bus with the later conversion spinning around in the rain due to 
the wheels locking up on one axle only. Playing with brakes over hearsay 
is playing with your life. If VW thought a 72 and later master was a 
good choice on a split they would have done it. Get a 68 to 70 master if 
you don't want to drop the money on a real 67 and devise your own 
reservoir, at least these were still designed to be used on the same size 4 
wheel drum brakes. For anther 50 dollars the 67 MC works just fine for 
me over the per say "safer conversion"

You can play with values in this formula for a simple 
brake system to see how they effect each other:

F1 A1
__ = __
F2 A2

whereas:
F1= Force, in pounds, applied to master cylinder
F2= Force, in pounds, being applied to wheel cylinder
A1= Area of master cylinder piston, in square inches
A2= Area of wheel cylinder piston, in square inches

F2, the force being applied to the wheel cylinder is what we
want to find out...

OK, let's plug in the following info: for A1> 22.5mm master cylinder
(or converted to .636 sq.in.). for A2> 22.5mm wheel cylinder
(also converted to .636 sq.in.)
Apply 100 pounds pressure for F1, and F2 would be......
100 pounds!

OK, let's adjust the info: for A1> 24mm master cylinder
(or converted to .724 sq.in.). for A2> 22.5mm wheel cylinder
(converted to .636 sq.in.)
Apply 100 pounds pressure for F1, and F2 would be......
87.85 pounds !!??!!

Thus proving that "bigger isn't always better!"

DUCK
