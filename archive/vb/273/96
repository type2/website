Hello friends everywhere,

We have settled down in Flagstaff, AZ in an apartment. Since we left SF we've 
been on the road for nearly 9 months. Will be here for a while, at least 
until our second future driver is born. 

Our place is right off of I-40, exit 201, on the eastern side of Flagstaff. 
Anyone passing thru the area that needs a place to crash can call us up or 
email us. I've received plenty of help and good will ever since I got into this 
circle. Would love to pay it forward, so to speak.

Sean, you were asking about the Jerome earlybirds earlier? If you want, come 
on by and stay here. We can host people on the floor. Nothing luxurious other 
than indoor plumbing, electricity and kitchen amenities. But Jerome veterans 
would know that a shower is nice... Fill up your water container while you're 
here.

You all have a safe drive behind the beautiful split screens!
