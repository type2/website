John,
I dunno what you have on the Bus--What does the label on the can say?
Who makes the stuff?
What kinda reducer did you use in it?
What kinda hardner you use in it?
What is the temperature where the Bus is sitting?

All this make a difference in the correct answer of how long it takes to
cure to correct or repair the runs---
