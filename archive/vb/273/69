 Jim,

Gene Berg www.geneberg.com sells fans. Also, go to Sears and get their
$12 flat rachetting 17mm wrench for those upper nuts. You can have them
on/off in seconds. I've been using one for 15 years. Makes engine pulls
fast and easy. You use the wrench itself to feel for the nut, then engage
and ratchet.
