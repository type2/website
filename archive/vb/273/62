Subject: $$HELP$$     Front deluxe trim still needed !!

I ran around through several web pages of people finder type things with no
positive results, then dialed directory assistance for Ormond Beach,
Florida, & they came up dry also. So, I do not know the guys phone number. I
did find out that several "Tyler" members live in the Ormond Beach area.
Even the addresses were listed. No "Bill's" though. No "William's", either.
At least as far as the info on the web.
 If you pass by this "1320 Hand Ave, #12", is it an apartment house, or a
place of business? The directory assistance people couldn't tell me anything
about that address. (By way of history, Jerry & Melissa Jess sent out a call
for the 2 front trim pieces for a splitty VW bus, & this Bill Tyler guy sent
an email saying he has one for $40, & he can send it for $5, a deal was
struck, I sent him the $45, the check clears on 25.July, I email him on the
30th, he emails back saying I should get them by 9.Aug, I emailed him on the
18th, as well as the 28th to say they have not arrived, but I've heard
nothing from him. I guess I can send all this info to the District Attorney
of Ormond Beach's county, but that's a last resort & I'd never see this $45
or trim ever. The DA would do whatever he does, & what will be will be.)
Thanks, again.
