My father and brother are both firefighters here in Nashville so I
asked them. My dad did say it might change between different cities,
but as a matter of practice..

single alarm is the first call for a fire. It could be anywhere from
one engine co. to 2 engine co. and a ladder co. or whatever.

2nd alarm would be the second release of fire companies after the
first got there (for example reienforcements)

3rd would be the third release and so on and so forth.

then there is a general alarm, where everyone in the municipality were
called to a fire. However he did point out that even w/ a general
alarm there will always be a couple of companies held back at the fire
hall just in case another problem errupts.

and there you have it, a multiple alarm fire could either mean a lack
of personal sent for a particular fire, or a fire that had gotten much
worse than initially expected.
