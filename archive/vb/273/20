Subject: Bus Camper Interior: Thanks for Your Help!

All,

I wanted to thank all of those of you who have responded so far to my 
request for info on building my own camping interior for my splitty.  I 
would like to share with you the info I have gained so far, as well as 
especially thank Jacques Ollivier and Matt Faust for their help!  (I would 
love to see pics of your project, Matt!  Keep me informed!  And I will try 
the search you suggested, Jacques.  Great lead!)

OK, it seems that all of the sources for splitty camping interiors are in 
jolly ole' England.  (Can't find a single company who will touch a splitty 
in the USA -- but if you want your Ford or Dodge camperized, the choices are 
plentiful.) The top of the heap on the English scene are the following:


BUSGUTZ
Nick Parker-Davies runs this place, and builds SOLID WOOD custom and DIY 
interiors which he will either install himself or gladly pack off to you for 
DIY installation.  His stuff looks fantastic, and he responds to emails in a 
heartbeat!

CAPLYSO CAMPERS
Jon and Sue Freemantle run this place, and their site is jam-packed with 
ideas and examples of their work.  They seem to specialize in building and 
installing camper interiors -- not so much into DIY, but it never hurts to 
ask.

DANBURY RIO CAMPERVAN
These people do installs of a knockdown, flat-pack camping interior known as 
the Rio.  Many of you may have seen this interior advertised in the Brit VW 
bus mag _Camper Van and Commercial_.  It is made of pressboard and covered 
with some sort of venere.  This interior is made to fit in bays, but with 
modifications, it probably could go into a splitty, too.

Ok, I hope this helps anyone else out there with the same interests as me.  
Sadly, the shipping costs will be the real rub with these interiors, but 
there seem to be no choices for this sort of stuff in America.   Is there an 
untapped market for these sort of interiors just waiting to explode here in 
the US, or is there actually no market for them, and I am just an oddball (I 
know which one I would place my bets on ;-)

Thanks again, everyone,  I would appreciate hearing anything from the rest 
of you who might have some leads here in the US or abroad.  As you can see, 
I have plenty of examples, but no one has offered actual plans, yet.
