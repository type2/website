Hi Duck,
Not true!!  If you check the "Official Service Manual" for 1968-79 bus, 
section "Brakes And Wheels", area 5.2, on page 13, you will see the brake pressure 
regulator for buses with disc brakes.  Disc brakes require alot more pressure 
to work and thusly this regulator is installed to prevent the rear drum brakes 
from locking up before the front brakes.  Without this regulator a disc brake 
bus would loose control as you have stated!!!!!!  When used on all drum 
brakes the pressure is the same to all four wheels just like the 1950-71ish MCs.
