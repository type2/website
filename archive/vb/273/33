 While adjusting the brake shoes I noticed that a couple of the star adjuster
 brakes, the little sheet metal clips that toggle the star, were broke off or
 missing. These seem to be attached to the back plate and looked to be spot
 welded on. Are there replacement pieces that you can replace them with or do
 you have to replace the back plate? >>

make them up like others said of spring steel and drill/tap a hole to screw 
them into.  otherwise you to have to replace the backingplate, more work than 
you need to do.   The idea is that the springs keep the stars from turning on 
their own.   then you can make sure the stars spin freely (grease grease 
grease) and then it'll be really easy to adjust the brakes next time, and hopefully 
you'll adjust them much more often.  :)
