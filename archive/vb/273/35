No picking "percieved" John. I had my 67 dual circuit 22mm MC for the first
couple of years that I owned the truck and found that there was a smaller
volume of fluid available to the wheel cylinders before the pedal bottomed
out. Properly adjusted brakes asside and substituting a 24mm original
application power assist MC for the original MC, there is anoticable
difference in braking power. Even when my 67 MC was in good shape and stopped
normally enough when my truck was empty, put 1400 lbs of gravel in the back
and Whoa Baby. I still haul the same size loads and don't have to worry about
my ability to stop under load.

I'm into dynamic testing, try it and see what it really does, instead of
figuring it out on paper. I wish I had the vacuum canister off of my old 71
westy, but heck, now I can pedal my bycicle up hill!

The *percieved* increased stopping power is probably due to the freshly
adjusted brakes. The stopping power of a brake system comes from the
pressure created in the master cylinder by your foot pushing on the
pedal. The pressure is measured in pounds/square inch (or force/unit
area, to make it universal). If you increase the area, you also have to
increase the force to keep the force/unit area number the same as it was
before. A 24mm cylinder has a greater area (3.14 x 24mm^2)/4 than a 22mm
cylinder (3.14 x 22mm^2)/4, therefore the force you apply to the pedal
to get the same pressure in the brake system with a 24mm cylinder is
greater than the force you must apply with a 22mm cylinder. That is why
I just bought a real '67 master cylinder to put in my bus to replace the
72-79 that's in there now.

If you have the leg muscle to go with the later cylinder it's an OK
choice. I've decided that I would rather spend the extra money and get
the maximum braking power I can. The later cylinder is really meant to
be used with a power assisted brake system.

I'm not trying to pick on you Ray, I just want people who are making
choices about their brakes to understand the math.
