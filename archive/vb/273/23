Subject: Re: [VB] temp. question

that's quite a change!   Anyone else have temp changes they recorded after 
changing gearing?  

I know my 65 feels underpowered with a 1600sp with the tall gearing, which is 
why it's going to get a 1679.   I wouldn't be surprised that making it work 
harder (like when you are riding a bike up a hill in the wrong gear) would make 
it run hotter.(FWIW the engine in the 65 is fine, felt plenty perky in my 61 
immediately before the switch, and the motor in my 61 feels perky, which was 
wimpy in the 65.  I swapped them as I was taking a trip in the 61 and wanted 
the known reliable motor)

Eric & Barb said that higher gearing makes the bus run cooler at the same 
road speed.     ???????????

 going over 230F (at that point, I would pull over). Switched the tranny to a
 stock geared trans, then I could drive 65mph, without the oil temps going
 over 210-220. That is back to back. Same exact bus, same exact drive, same
 exact engine. The ONLY change, was gearing.
