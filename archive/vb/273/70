Subject: Rear axle question / project update

Hi all ,   
   I'm just gettings ready to install the rear end back in my bus.  I bought a set of one piece axle boots, and would like some advice on installing them prior to attempting it.  Any advice on this is greatly appreciated.
 
For anyone who cares about my project status, read on
 
Some of you may remember about a year ago I posted about my input shaft coming out when I pulled my engine.  When I pulled the trans, I decided to tackle everything that was questionable.  My intent for this bus is to make it a reliable daily driver.
So far, here is what I've done...
   - completely removed everything for the rear axle
   - blasted and painted the axle tubes, RGB housings, backing plates, etc
   - replaced all mounts and shift coupling
   - replaced the reverse gear snap ring, main shaft seal, and shift rod seal
   - drained and cleaned out trans - it was pretty nasty! ( it did shift/ drive well )
   - degreased / sanded / POR 15 all of the areas that will be difficult to get with the trans installed
 
   I also found that I had two bad bearings ( one per side ) in my RGB's, only 2 bolts holding on the right RGB, 3 holding the left, a worn out spring plate, and various other problems.
 
 As soon as I timesert the bolts that were broken off, I'll be ready to put this whole thing back togather.  The RGB's get new bearings all the way around, as well as new brakes for the rear. That should only be another week or so.   Then , on to the engine...
 
When I have more time to update my website, I'll post the link.
