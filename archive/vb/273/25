Embarrassed to say that I reamed and used J.B. Weld. Used a Q-Tip to clean the
epoxy out of the hole and a circular brass brush on my roto-tool when it was
set to clean the pilot hole out good.

I'll get the new one today... if it isn't a tight fit I'll ream out the
hole a bit and have my friend make me a custom one.  Or has anyone tried
the 'ol JBWeld fix for something like this????
