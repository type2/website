Subject: Alternator question

I came up with a couple of Beetle alternators and am unsure what the contacts
are. I usually use the Motorola two terminal one, B+ and field, but these have
the field and a round 3 terminal bus set in white nylon. Are all three
terminal B+ or are there other things going on there. the alternators are
factory 043 903 023.

Thanks
Ray
