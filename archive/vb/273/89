Subject: Re: [VB] Runs in paint

So the paint I used is polyurethane - how long does it usually take to be dry
enough to start sanding?  I went around with my run razor this morning - maybe
12 hrs after painting and it really works well - but I suspect it is too soon
so I put the razor away for a while.
