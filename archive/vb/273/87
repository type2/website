<< Hi all ,   
    I'm just gettings ready to install the rear end back in my bus.  I bought 
a set of one piece axle boots, and would like some advice on installing them 
prior to attempting it.  Any advice on this is greatly appreciated.
  ....................
I put these on my 65 westy when I installed the rebuildt tranny. 

turn boots inside out
 warm boots up in hot water or with hair dryer. 
  pull small end first over the dish at the inner end of the axle tube.  

 Yes, it's a pain, but easier than taking the boxes off and replacing them.

since that was a few years ago, I had to replace them with split boots, as 
they got old.  But the seamless ones sure looked nice!!!!
