Although the alternator conversion kits include new tin, I can't see any
difference between the 30A generator and alternator tin.  There _is_ a
difference between the 38A (bus generator) and 30A (bug generator) tin.

If the alternator has been damaged, I would opt for a new internal
regulator Bosch alternator.  Since you are already set up for an
alternator it will be an easy install.
