Subject: PS VW Curtains

Oh, I almost forgot!  An honorable mention goes to VW curtains, another 
English company that does fantastic repros and custom versions of splitty 
and bay camper curtains.  Also a great place to get the '76 balls and other 
accessories that many of you are hunting for.  They also have some camper 
stuff.
