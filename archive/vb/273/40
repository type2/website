Hi, John and the List...
You can play with values in this formula for a simple
brake system to see how they effect each other:

F1       A1
__  =   __
F2       A2

whereas:
F1= Force, in pounds, applied to master cylinder
F2= Force, in pounds, being applied to wheel cylinder
A1= Area of master cylinder piston, in square inches
A2= Area of wheel cylinder piston, in square inches
