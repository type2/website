Subject: Re: [VB] temp. question

Showing lower head temps at 3000 as opposed to 3500 rpm is normal if you are
doing it with the same vehicle. It takes less HP to push your bus the speed
it goes at 3000rpm, than it does to push it the speed it goes at 3500rpm.
More HP created, more heat is created.

What I'm talking about, is two different rpms, at the same speed. Two
identical buses, both buses doing exactly 65mph. One bus is geared so that
it is spinning 3800rpm, the other is geared so that it is spinning 3300rpm.
Both engines are creating the same HP, thus, the same heat (as long as both
engines are the same). The engine spinning the coolign fan 15% slower is
going to be running hotter.

It is not the same as driving your bus at 3000 rpm, then driving your bus at
3500 rpm and saying that the higher rpms make it run hotter. Creating more
HP to make the bus go faster is what is making the heat.

My old 66 bus had tall gearing. Couldn't go over 60mph without the oil temps
going over 230F (at that point, I would pull over). Switched the tranny to a
stock geared trans, then I could drive 65mph, without the oil temps going
over 210-220. That is back to back. Same exact bus, same exact drive, same
exact engine. The ONLY change, was gearing.
