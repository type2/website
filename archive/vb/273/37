In their English-language literature, VW seemed to say "Pick-up"
and "Double-cab Pick-up".  They used the dash; never "pickup" in
any of the literature I've seen.  (Check out the lit yourself
on Wade's VW truck site, http://www.dropgates.com/ ).

I have an un-official German reference (Doliwa) which says
"Pritschenwagen" and "Pritschenwagen mit Doppelkabine".
