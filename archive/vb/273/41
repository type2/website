My Dad's '74 Bug has a Motorola alternator like this.  On his, there's
a big connection by itself (I can't remember if it's a stud or a big
push-on) for B+ (battery).  The wire that goes on this one is fat, like
6 mm^2.  There are three small push-ons on three sides of a square that
mate with a round rubber female plug.  These three are D+ (warning light
- red wire), DF (field positive - green wire), and D- (field negative/
ground - brown wire).  All three of these wires are small, like 1 mm^2.
All 3 go to the regulator under the seat (in a Bug).  The blue wire
from the dash light is connected to D+ at the regulator along with
the red wire from the alternator.

Take a look at the left side of about a '73-'79 Bus or '73-'74 Bug
wiring diagram for the original specs.
