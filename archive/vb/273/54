wow, you really have a bad leak.   sounds like the oil cooler seals are bad.  
 solution:  tow bus home, pull motor, replace seals .   

oil cooler seals should be replaced anytime to replace the main seal.  some 
people dont do this, meaning they get really old and chunchy.

the parts are cheap, at least.  And while the engin eis out, check yr fuel 
line, tranny axle boots, engine to body seal, grommets for accelerator cable, 
fuel line, etc.
