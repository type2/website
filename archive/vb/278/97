Look at www.vintagebus.com for Thom's write-up on how to do it."

I just replaced my center pin and bushing as per this very article and had no
trouble what-so-ever.I An easier to read version (larger, clearer text) can be
found in the type2 archives. It does take a while do to all the constant
hand-wrenching, but that could be eased if you have one o' them there
gear-wrenches.

Use a very thick washer (or a small piece of plate steel with a hole) under
the turning nut for smooth, easy work. I started with a thin washer which bent
under the pressure and made tough work of the turning. I moved to a thicker
piece of steel and the whole thing eased up. I used the same device in reverse
to install the new bushings. I also used a socket just smaller in OD than the
bushings' OD rather than using a drift (which I didn't have). Use the workshop
manual in conjunction with the article and you can't go wrong. Remember to
install the bottom bushing FIRST- the upper bushing must protrue .050" if I
remember correctly. Check the manual.

I also used a brake cylinder hone to ream the bushings after installation.
Worked like a charm. The pin fit in tightly with no slop, yet turns smoothly
with little effort. Lotsa grease! You have to be patient though and check it
frequently or you may over-size the diameter. The article also says that he
discarded the extra seals that came with the new pin. My manual states that
these are newly upgraded seals and shows the order of installation. I included
them in the install. E-mail me if you need more details.

Good luck,
