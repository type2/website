 Josh,

Get your door bottoms welded up rather than putting other doors in. There
used to be pieces available that replaced the bottoms of the doors, that
you would weld on, and paint over. Get to know a decent small local body
shop that is friendly towards your bus, and who will do small jobs for
you. Or, learn how to weld, and rent the tools and go for it.

Throwing out a pair of doors just because they have some rust holes, is
not going to help anyone who owns a bus. Or ask the list for doors, and
offer to send your old ones to someone on the list. We don't have parts to
throw away anymore.

Regarding the speedo, keep a bus log, and use the existing miles when you
do work or install a new engine. Subtraction is an easy and useful skill.
