Just went to  www dot volkswagen dot com dot br

and configured one with their "configurator"

Cool. You can have it any color you like, as long as it's white.
I tricked mine out with the only option available, a rear window
defroster. This also gets you a heavier duty battery and alternator.
Actually, you can also get one that runs on alcohol, but that is a moot
point in the US.

Note that these are multi-point fuel-injected...
Also, the roof is higher than bays seen in the US.

A few (well, 20 is not so few) years back they made them with 50 hp
1600cc Diesel engines, and a nose mounted radiator. That combo gave 17
kilometers per liter, or about  40 mpg! Also available then as a Diesel
SC or DC, with a wider bed than what you are used to seeing. Carried as
much as it weighed. They sold about 1500 a month of these between 1981
and 1986.
Drool.
Here's a link to a site that has photos:

this same site shows a 4 wheel drive 15 window split bus with a bay
nose. look for the link on the left navigation bar.
