Subject: Queen of all strange bus sounds

First let me say that I haven't done any repairs on the bus in a few weeks.  I
** REALLY ** need a rest from repairs and repaired repairs ... Just wanted to
add a new noise to my existing  ** THUNK ** noise .. Sometimes when my car has
been parked a while, on the slightest incline ... left usually in gear .. When
I start her up, put her in reverse, she feels like there is something
grabbing, not letting me back up .. then it *** POPS *** loose and I can go
backwards.  It is a noise as loud as the ** CLUNK ** as it frees itself from
whatever is stuck .. any ideas ?? Not that I will be able to fix it .. but I
can add it to my list of "things to get someone else to fix."  Hopefully my
money tree will blossom in the next couple of weeks.
