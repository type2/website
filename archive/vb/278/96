The "right" way to do it would be to install dual-filament bulbs, such
as are used in the rear lights on US-spec Buses.  The "dim" filament
would get wired to the parking lights, and the "bright" filament would
get wired to the turn signals.  The problem with doing this is that it
may be hard to adapt the double-contact socket you would need to the
front turn signal lights already on the Bus.

You could keep the existing lights and fake it with a resistor and a
couple of diodes.  Go to Radio Shack and buy one pack 271-131 (2 each
1.0 ohm 10 watt resistors, $1.69) and one pack 276-1661 (4 each 6 amp
50 PIV diodes, $2.49).  Go home and wire it up like this...

               |---diode>---2
1---resistor---*
               |---diode>---3

The '>' on the end of the 'diode>' indicates the end with the stripe.
Connection 1 goes to the left rear parking light fuse (gray/black
stripe wire) at the fuse box.  Connection 2 goes to the left front
turn signal light wire (black/white stripe) and connection 3 goes
to the right front turn signal light wire (black/green stripe).

It's best to solder the resistor and diodes, but crimp connections
will also work.  When you hook connection 1 to the parking light
fuse, make sure you get the downstream side of the fuse - in other
words, take out both fuses, turn on the parking lights, and connect
to the fuse clip that _doesn't_ have power.

When you have it all in, give it a try.  Your turn signals and
hazards should work like normal.  With the headlight switch in
anything other than fully pushed in, the front turn signals should
light dimly.  When glowing dimly, they should light up brighter if
you turn on the turn signal for that side, or the hazards.

Note that it is very important that other drivers be able to tell
your turn signals from your front parking lights!  Dual-filament
bulbs for this application usually have a 10:1 brightness ratio
(32 candlepower vs 3 candlepower) for turn signals:parking lights.
If the turn signals aren't sufficiently brighter than the parking
lights, first use the other resistor:

                              |---diode>---2
1---resistor---*---resistor---*
                              |---diode>---3

and if that doesn't get it, use the other two diodes:

                              |---diode>---*---diode>---2
1---resistor---*---resistor---*
                              |---diode>---*---diode>---3

When you're happy with it, figure out a place to mount it where
nothing will ground out on the body.  Also keep in mind that when
the parking lights are on, each resistor and diode will dissipate
around 4 watts, so don't put it right up against a vinyl kick
panel lining or anything.

I hope this helps!
