ronnie sez there are a number of you, either having built your own 
motor using the AL cases, or having one built for you...
i would love to see yours run side by side with mine to compare 
baseline temps and running notes. kyle or any one else who lives in 
the valley, please  buzz me off-list.

i am also told i 'am the only one with problems' with these motors. 
i'd like to see if your experiences bear that out :P
