Entertainment, if you're into it.  Truckers discuss a lot of things
just to keep one another awake out on the road.  Plus, they have
practical tips, like where the local bears hide out.  Sometimes
there will be a "local" at home in a town you're driving through
that will get on and harangue people.  Just change the channel.

One interesting thing about CB (and other two-way radios, like ham
and public safety) is that it is perfectly acceptable for there to
be time gaps in the conversation that aren't socially acceptable
on the telephone.  It's understood that sometimes you might need
to operate the vehicle and not talk back right away.

I haven't traveled that much with a cell phone, but it seems reasonable
that there are some areas where a CB might put you in touch with a
human more reliably than a cell phone.

The best thing to do if you haven't listened to one in a while is to
just listen and don't talk much.  After you listen to it for a while
you will pick up the jargon and then possibly be able to have a
reasonable conversation.

Watch out for that brake check up ahead... JB dropped an alligator
and the four-wheelers don't like running over those.
