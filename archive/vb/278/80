Two weeks off is a lot of time when I saw 615 e-mails sitting in my in basket.
One of the things I didn't see on my 9 days of travel by train, (4 1/2 up and
4 1/2 back), was a lot of dubs of any variety. While I was in Florida I saw
three bugs and I saw two busses in Montana and one in Chicago. Not a good
showing. I lost count of how many I saw traveling through Washington state.

As a side note, I forgot to fill my tank on my truck when I left and drew
water over the two weeks. Splashed two pints of alcohol into it and then drove
it over to be filled once it started running again. I had a back fire while
the water was cycling through the motor and it blew out the carb plug on the
body just above the throttle plate. I had installed this 31 PICT on the truck
just before I left to tune it up and test it. It is the third 31 PICT that has
lost the bore plug. The last two I cleaned up and J.B. Weld back in place.
Anyone else having problems with this plug on their 31's?
