Hi Volks,
Definitely it works well, though make sure you rub it in well before applying 
water!  Some cleaners only work with water ands some only before adding 
water, it is amazing how many folks do not know the differance!  Also by working 
some of this type of cleaner or even normal soap under your finger nails will 
greatly help with grease/dirt removal there when you wash your hands after 
getting filthy.
  As for checking oil the general rule is every other gas fill up, but make 
sure to wait at least 10 minutes after shutting off the engine before 
checking/adding oil.  The oil cooler and oil passages hold about 1 quart.  So if you 
just shut it down and immediately check the oil level and find it at the fill 
line, by adding a quart it probably is now a quart over full.  In cooler weather 
doing this you can easily blow out the front main seal which in turn coats 
the clutch into a slipping mess.
