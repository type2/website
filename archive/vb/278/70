Also, it's fun to listen to the truckers talk about
you.  Once in northern New Mexico one trucker asked
another if he thought my singlewheel trailer was full
of "mary-juana"!

But really I've had pretty good luck talking to
truckers with the CB, and if one is too much of a jerk
to help you, the next one might.  Cell phone do have
limited coverage.
