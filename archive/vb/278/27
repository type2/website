Finding the "Zen" in oneself will not prevent the copious amounts of
financial outlay that is required to keep any 20--30-40--50 year old
vehicle in operating condition, nor eliminate the mental anguish when
something fails .

A good job----plenty of cash, some sort of mechanical aptitude will
assist in this ownership / owner bonding thing---which sometimes I feel
is a bit beyond all common sense--but to each his own--
It's machine not a person, and machines require money--lots of it, if
your going to keep it's heart, legs and arms moving waaay beyond it's
intended life cycle.

And this is what happening here--and in other older vehicle
communities--the folks who won't give up the ghost-- and return to
reality--that it ain't the 60's no more--and you just might have to buy
new---

There are times when it is not a realistic possibility that you can do
all of the mechaniclly required repairs to your vehicle by yourself--and
your just going to have to depend on a mechanic to get the job done
right--

How many of you out there have the required VW  protractor to properly
adjust torsion bars for instance? ( the key word here is properly )
Or a press , or a boring bar, or  a valve grinder-- gear
puller's---etc.etc---

You can't depend on Muir to get you out of some sticky situations--and a
rain dance,  some grei-grei, Zen, Good Carma, some Albanian goat bones,
and a  Voo Doo doll, just ain't gonna get the job done. --right anyway.
