JDD,

I havent been in my horn button since the resto in 1995, but I believe
from memory, that I soldered the horn wire to the button contact. The
button action grounds the wire coming up from the horn, and it should be
obvious how it all goes together. I'm quite sure I soldered the wire to a
contact.
