Subject: RE: [VB] Center Pivot Pin Replacement

  All I ever use is a punch and tap out the top one, then come in from the
top and tap out the lower one. I use a body dolly to tap the bottom bushing
out as there isn't much room. I have found this faster and just as easy as
using the correct tool due to set up time. If you have a hard time tapping
the old bushings out, use a hack saw blade or die grinder and curt a groove
in them. 
  Average time to do the total job 1 to 1 1/2 hours, start to finsh.

Subject: [VB] Center Pivot Pin Replacement


I had the earlier post "want less steering play" and it was aptly suggested
I look at the center pivot and replace it if bad.  Well, the cener pin
wobbles around all over the place so I read the web page that was forwarded
to me by steve, and I ordered a new pivot/bushing kit and have rented a
reamer.  I have two concerns:

I can't find the bushing removal tool that was mentioned in the web page -
anyone know where I can get it?, someone told me a chisel will work?

I asked a mechanic if he would do it for me because I didn't have the
bushing remover and he said it was an awful job
and that he wouldn't do it.  This is a guy I respect, and hearing that got
me a bit down, so I need some encouragement.. can I do this one ?  Keep in
mind, I could tell some good stories to the Apartment dweller.  I will be
doing this in a parking lot with the bus on jack stands.. There hasn't been
a job I couldn't do so far, but I don't want to be half finished when it
gets dark and have no way of steering the bus to get it out of the way..
thanks
