Yup, cloth covered wiring wasn't used stock on buses since ?51.   my 53 has 
the plastic coated wires.  but the gas guage in this 58 had cloth coated wires 
for the gas guage.  so it was obviously installed after the bus was made.    
ah, the wonders of modern chemistry have made many useful plastics available to 
us.    old houses have cloth covered wires in them.  often considered a fire 
hazard, especially as many more electric appliances are used now than back 
then.  ever notice how old houses have fewer electric sockets?
