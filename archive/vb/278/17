Subject: cross country trip rom Norcal to Eastern TN & I hope Back

Jan & I are taking a nearly four week trip to go across the country to Erwin, 
TN from Cupertino CA.
We will be in Erwin the first weekend in October for the Apple & Blue Ridge 
pottery Festival.
Then we go to Circle yer Wagons at Sevierville, near Dollywood!

As you see I am a hybrid splittie, Baywindow vanagon nut, so would love to 
meet people on the way there & back, although we sort of have to hurry there.

Any suggestions as to places to stay on the way, & routes, north Vs south. I 
think we will go north & come back south. 
Looking forward to meeting some of my 'mailbox in the sky' buddies
