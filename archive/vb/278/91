Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel reserve cable.

i called wolfsburg west about one a few months ago and they told me that the
beetle choke cable will work.  it came with the cable and the sheath.  i
think it was 20 bucks or something, so i spent the time and straightened
mine so it worked smoothly.  hope this helps!
