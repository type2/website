Subject: New Found Item----

Hey All---

Here is a simple item that has failed me several times in the past--and
I was getting tired of replacing them--
The courtesy light switch in the door jamb.

These antiquated open cad plated switches are prone to failure --just
because the contact points are open--and even though I have coated them
a bunch with die electric--the little contacts are constantly corroding
and the dome light won't function all the time.
I have replaced them 3 times using the original open type.
Junk---

So I was at VW today and did some reasearch--and snooping in the parts
department--and have found a permanet solution--a totally sealed from
the elements switch---alll boxed in--no more rusting or corroding of the
contact points, and---a direct fit--same size as the original and will
fit from 68 to 91 Type 2's as well as the Vanagons--

I bought 20 of them and have them available for a good price--

Drop me a line if you might be interested in solving a on going problem
--permanetly.

Later,
