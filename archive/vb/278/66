My buddy emmit and I got separated on the way to
Busses by the Blue Ridge (anybody remember that?) a
few years ago. I had a CB, and lent emmit my old unit,
and my antenna which I had pirated the top three
inches to make a new accelerator pedal push-rod from.
With that "shortened" antenna, his range was about 100
yards! 
After we got separated he was able to locate me by
talking to a trucker ("anybody seen an old primer gray
panel bus?"...hehe) , who got on the horn with some
other truckers, and figured out that I had doubled
back to look for emmit. Otherwise we would have driven
for god knows how long in opposite directions. most
truckers are pretty cool, if you ask for help nicely
:)
