You can talk to all the truckers "good buddy" and listen to them all cus you
out, "that dam slow bus I almost hit going up that long grade". At least
you'll know when to get out of the way with a CB.

Currently I am in somewhat of a panic not really ready to leave Wednesday 
evening for eastern TN.
Someone suggested getting a CB
I have a cell phone with nationwide calling, does a CB offer anything much 
better?
