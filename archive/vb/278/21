At the risk of making you mad, I would venture that you have _read_
the "Idiot" manual, but you don't _understand_ it yet.  To me, the
premise of that manual is "yes, you CAN do it yourself."  There have
been people who started out not knowing which end of a screwdriver
to hold that took that book and a sick VW, _rebuilt the engine_, put
it back in their VW, and drove around for several tens of thousands
of miles.  "Free your mind and your (-at-)ss will follow."

As far as paying someone else to work on your Bus... you have to
realize that your Bus is now 36 years old.  Mechanics can make a
lot more money working on new Hondas and Toyotas and Fords and
Dodges than they can working on old VWs, so that's what they do.
The mechanics that still do work on air-cooled VWs are probably
a lot more familiar with Bugs - there were about five times more
Bugs than Buses built.  You can try different shops until you
find one that wants to work on your Bus, or you can do the work
yourself.

I apologize if this post sounds accusatory or mean; it's not meant
that way.
