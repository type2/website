Ya, I watched that when I was down in Orlando week before last. What a shame,
and they weren't really successful on that hill climb, but neither was the
four wheel drive electric rig!

Just finished watching Junkyard megawars.  They cut up
a 15 window bus to make a rock crawling vehicle.
Really too bad, 'cause it didn't look all that bad.
