Ya the nitrile ones don't break down under grease, so they are good for 
greasing the bus.  Also good against a lot of solvents that melt latex.    I'd use 
them in the lab when using CCl4, and stuff that was really nasty.

I got a box at harbour freight too, and they seem a size too small.  They are 
sturdier than the latex though.

I bought those nitrile gloves (-at-) Harbor Freight & I get 1 one on a hand for
about every one that tears apart in trying to get it on!  Is it only moi?
Maybe I got the wrong size for my hands?
