Subject: horn - How does it go back together

So I pulled my horn button off and finally figured out how it comes apart ...
now how do I get it back together.  Do you put that copper wire in to the
little brass disk and then put it back together?  Or do you put it all
together and then push that copper wire into through the hole?
