Are you serious? This isn't a restoration, it's a
rebuilding to the owner's specs. Even Ronnie won't
call it a restoration. What's the
definition/difference between a "restoration" and 
"vintage restoration"? 
If wrong color, big engine, freeway flier trans,
"custom" interior, later front end (I'm assuming there
Ronnie, for bigger, later brakes) now classify as a
"restoration", what is a "Custom" then?
Sorry, but it Ronnie's DC will NEVER be a RESTORATION
to me. It may be a nice rebuilding, but not a resto.
Call me a Vintage Nazi, I don't care.
