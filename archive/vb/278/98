Subject: RE:  latex gloves

I had this problem as well when using a box of nitrile un-powdered mediums I
got for free from work. The ones I did manage to get on without tearing fit
tightly and became like a second skin after a few minutes. Held up well
against Aircraft Remover (burned right through the latex gloves). Next time
I buy a box I'd try a larger size and find powdered ones.
