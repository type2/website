Hmmmm, restored... wouldn't that ultimately mean 'brought back to some
*previous* state'?  Then again, Ronnie is 'restoring' it to an operable
state!

Go Ronnie Go.

>>>>>>Hey Ronnie,

In my opinion, you can call it a restoration. The folks over on the R&R
forum are just touchy. It's not like you're going to call it a 'vintage
restoration', right? I'll consider it a restoration, and I know most
people
will too.
