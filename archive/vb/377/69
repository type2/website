Subject: Another Friday engine question: Parts list

Hey,

So if I wanted to build an engine myself, I'd rather spec out the  
pieces myself rather than buying a kit.

Has anyone here used a parts list that would include tools? I have  
the BugMe video. I sold my How to rebuild Aircooled engines book (not  
sure why). I have the Bentley(s) and many other manuals. Are there  
any parts list resources you've used? I would like something down to  
the nuts and washer level obviously.

Conrad
