I was  wondering how long you could go on battery power.


Hi John,
Of course how big and old your battery will affect this.  We drove  only 
during daylight, and parked with push starting in mind to keep the  battery drain 
down.  Having oil pressure and temp, was the only way to tell  the fan belt 
had not failed, since the gen light was on all the time.  With  a voltage gauge 
we could monitor that voltage did not go below 10.5 which would  damage the 
battery.  We figured when voltage dropped low enough to this, we  would find a 
gas station for a charge, but did not need to do that.
