    Gas gauge testing by default! To do a quick and easy test for a fuel
gauge/system operation, use a simple voltage test.
    With your handy dandy voltmeter set for the twelve volt scale. With the
ignition off, and the sending unit disconnected.
     Hook the voltmeters positive lead to the sending unit power wire/lead,
attach the meters ground wire/lead to the ground wire/lead of the sending
unit. Now turn on the ignition switch, and note the voltage reading, it
should read "10.5 volts"! Now turn on the headlights, the reading should
"Still" be "10.5 volts"! If you get these readings, the complete gas gauge
wiring system, the voltage stabilizer, fuse, etc are good. If the voltage
readings change, the voltage stabilizer is bad. ( Voltage Stabilizer! )
Small "box" on back of gauge, that controls voltage spikes at gauge, by
maintaining the constant "10.5 voltage". If the voltage stabilizer were not
there, or not working right, the gas gauge would swing when ever you turned
something on or off, dimmed your lights, wiper sweep, etc! If you have no
voltage at the sending unit wire, after checking the fuse, check the voltage
stabilizer first! You should have battery voltage going in, and the "10.5
volts" coming out.
    The next thing to check is the gauge.
    Ignition switch still on. Disconnect the voltmeter wires from sending
unit wires. Touch the positive wire/lead and the negative/ground sending
unit wires together, and note what the gas gauge reads. If by grounding, and
un-grounding the two gauge wires together, your gauge swings from full to
empty, you have checked the complete system except the sending unit! And the
complete system is good. BTW, Volkswagen has a special variable resistance
tool for testing the gauge. Somewhat like the adjustable rheostat for the
lights in your living room, only costs ten times as much.
    So by doing this you have tested the sending unit by default! In other
words, if your gas gauge is not working the problem must be the sending
unit!
    Simple, and quick after you get to the wires! ;-) This also works on
almost all other Volkswagens cars, vans, pick-ups, water and air cooled,
etc.
    Well all except your 67 and older bug! ;-)
