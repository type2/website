owner just liked the way a deluxe looked i guess - he pointed out the 
stripe of paint on the logo :) as for the bed, it WAS green... it 
just had this white pebbly bed liiner that looked real nice. any one 
know if this was an original option? the claim was that this truck 
was a dealer-showroom jobbie - perhaps a few of the seemingly 'wrong' 
bits (chrome windows, cigarette lighter, bed liner, etc) were only 
for showroom cars?
