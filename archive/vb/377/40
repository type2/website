Subject: Blinker woes again

Ok, so I decided last Saturday to go ahead and make my 63 Panels wiring look
exactly like the wiring diagram. There weren't many changes that were made to
match the bus to the diagram I got off of the VB website for my bus. Like I've
posted before I soldered where possible, with my minimal soldering skills,
heat shrink was used, I meticulously went over the diagram and made sure it
all was the same, took me like most of the day. Now, where before I only had
the right rear blinker not working with the headlights on, all of my blinkers
don't work. I tried four different blinker relays, the two prong, that was on
it, two three prongs that came off of my 76 Westy and a four prong off of a
914 Porsche. No luck so far. I tried a multitude of combinations on the pins
and the most I got was with the flasher off of the 914. When I hooked that one
up and worked the turn signal switch it just acted like a toggle of sorts. If
I made a left turn the arrows on the speedo would light up, then go out if I
manually put the turn signal switch to the nuetral position and moved it again
to the left turn position, the same with a right turn.

I really don't understand why the wiring diagram is different from my bus if
in fact it is. I understand the whole thing with different models and options
but this is darn frustrating. Does anybody know where to get the original
styly flasher from, one with the S and K pin designations, one that has the
little tab to mount it to the front bulkhead. Luckily NC doesn't require me to
have a state inspection. Oh yeah I did manage to get my horn working, kinda
