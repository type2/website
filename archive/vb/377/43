Hi Seth,
We have had that problem and it turned out one or more of the bulb holders  
were not grounding to the body.  It could also be you need to spray the  
contacts in the signal switch with contact cleaner.
  You should be able to find a three terminal flasher relay in just  about 
any FLAPS.  The terminals might be labled differently.  Are  you using the USA 
version diagram from AUG 62 from Chassi # 971 550?
