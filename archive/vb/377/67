Subject: Re: [VB] Bus sighting in revenge of the nerds 3

    I love to watch old TV shows like, Dragnet, Chips, etc, checking for all
the Volkswagens. Another good one is "Bullet" with Steve McQueen. Love that
old iron ( or in some cases tin ) Seems the shows filmed in La La Land (
California ) had all the Volkswagens in the US.
    Who among us has not said, "if I could just go back to that time, I
would save all those cars"! Well as old as I am, I was there! Why didn't I
save a few? LOL
    I drove a 57 Chevy 2 dr hard top to high school I traded a 19 inch black
and white TV for. It looked fair, a few dings but no rust, and ran great. I
traded it for a set of water ski's. Man, that "Sherm" will make you do
strange things! Ah 20/20 hind site.
