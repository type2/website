A GREAT BBB!

Ups:
Perfect weather
Great folks
Great food
Terrific Raffle (would have been better if I won something! :)
Nice swaps
Interesting entertainment watching the honeywagon get unstuck on the beach

Downs:
The idiot who kicked in the bathroom door.
The nasty headwinds on I-40 all the way from the CA border to Victorville
and beyond.

Many thanks to the London Bridge Bullis and everyone else who pitched in
to make this event so much fun!
