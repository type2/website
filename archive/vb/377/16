Try this link:

If Eric was originally using the Fram PH8A Ford Filter, the Wix number would
be a 51515 (Wix 51068 is the "short" version").  An alternate is Wix 51452,
essentially the same with a slightly wider sealing lip, designed by Wix to
use on VW Diesels which have a lot of high oil pressure at a cold start up.
I have used both on the aftermarket full-flow filter systems with no
problems.

I've used Wix Filters for over two decades, having been introduced to them
when I started in the auto parts biz back then.  Perhaps the best quality
made filter today IMHO.
