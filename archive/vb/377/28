  yup. also, older gas lines. there were quite a few fires in older 
american cars that were traced to this. new hose and gaskets are 
'hardened' against this.

but man, new gasoline just AIN'T gasoline!  so engineered a chemical 
that many of our assumptions about vw motors no longer are valid - 
timing, head cooling, jetting.  good starting points, but ONLY a 
starting point.  the Old Guru who  vouchafes wisdom gleaned from the 
50s - 80s will snort, but its like a DEC mainframe guy telling you 
how your ipod should be programmed... yeah, BUT. coupla differences! 
-please, no dec or ipod geeks write me to tell me how wrong my 
example is!

my grandfather-in-law gave me a giant (and highly technical)  book 
circa 1930 on gasoline. my dad, who worked for gulf oil for 40 years, 
laughed and said "that's when they had 'free-range' gasoline!. now it 
all comes from a lab." he gave me ANOTHER huge book on refining oil 
circa 1988 that made my head hurt.  i don't even wanna know what they 
do to those poor hydrocarbons these days...
