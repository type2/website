Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Was "what type of oil and filter" [WIX filters]

Please note that the Wix 51516 Eric mentions is slightly less taller (by
about a 1/4 inch) than the Wix 51515 I mentioned in a previous post on this
related subject.  Just so people don't get confused and all.....

51515 = Tallest (-at-) 5.178"
51516 = 1/4" shorter
51068 = About 3/4" shorter
