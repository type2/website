Subject: Re: [VB] Seat belt retrofit?

I just finished a 65 project which was not equipped with seat belts,
but has the factory reinforcing bar under the cab and also the holes
ready to accept belts. I believe belts were a factory option in this
year.

 and a bolt that hold the retrofit seat belts. You can eyeball a bus with
 seat belts in it already to get an idea where to drill.
