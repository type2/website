    I agree its super nice. It must be very fresh, as it sure hasn't been
driven or even run much. The exhaust heat riser on the intake isn't burnt
yet ( may be powder coated ), the crank pulley has rust on it, also the
generator pulley shims and various other screws and studs.
    I don't mean to belittle the restoration, but the little things count,
the nose emblem, paint on the wheel weights. I'm not to sure about the
painted bed, is it stock? I don't think so. What they should do is discount
it to me by about a Gazillonteen dollars so I could afford it.
    I guess I'm one of those people who would "Bit*h if they hung me with a
new rope"! :-)
