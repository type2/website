Subject: Re: [VB] Electric vs Mechanicle?

    Are we talking about an alternator or a generator here? If its
generator, then worn brushes being short, are not held tight by the springs
against the armature. This causes an "arc" at the brush contact point. And
this will burn pits in the armature rather quickly. The armature will need
to be checked on a "growler", and if it passes this and the "size spec's" it
should be "turned" and the "mica" under cut before the brushes are replaced.
    If an alternator, then you will have a hard time finding someone to turn
the commutator. If the brush contact surface is smooth, clean it up with
some fine emery paper ( 600  grit ), and replace the internal voltage
regulator/brush holder and you should be ok.
