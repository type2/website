Hi Dave,
The problem is that over the years VW changed parts of the engine so having  
a list will not help to figure out what you get and need.  Plus there is  the 
dual port or single port difference!  Best to search around and find a  
complete core 1500 or 1600 cc engine.  Doing so will increase having  all the 
corresponding parts you will need to make it work.  Plus you will  have some extra 
parts and an engine to rebuild yourself.
