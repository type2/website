I've heard the ethanol eats rubber parts in old carbs.

 Conrad,
         I don't know of anything in contemporary fuel that is able to
 destroy old carbs.   The metal parts at least.   In fact, I've found
 that my solex carbs stay cleaner on the new fuels.  I ran old school 96
 octane leaded fuel as recently as the mid-90's in New Zealand and found
 more gumming issues with that petrol.  It stayed "fresh" in the tank
 much longer, though.
