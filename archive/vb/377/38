Subject: Engine replacement

Hi everyone

I am currently restoring a 64 bus which I bought with no engine.  I have found
a few places to buy a rebuilt without a core exchange however I do not have
all of the additional items on the motor. i.e. generator, intakes, carb,
generator stand, cooling tin.... I started to make a list of everything I need
to find but thought if anyone who has worked on VW 1600cc engine may already
have a list.  Thanks
