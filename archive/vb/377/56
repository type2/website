BTW,

Having attempted the "stripping by hand" thing - you're right about  
being expensive, and also very messy. Plus, I didn't realize how hard  
it would be to get into all those crevaces, etc.

I'm going to buy one of those $450 soda blasters (http://www.ace- 
sandblasting.com/mpg/ace_soda.mpg) and see how that works out. Of  
course, I'll have to borrow a larger air compressor to power it - and  
it will be slow going with such a small blaster. We'll see how it  
works out.
