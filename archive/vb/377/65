 I drove from near Cheyenne Wyoming to 6 miles short of Tonopah, NV on battery.   th eradio/tape player sounded funny, so kept it off.  When it got dark and I turned the headlight on, the engine stalled out.   We read the Idiot book in the morning, and diagnosed worn out gen brushes.  Push started it and drove into town and bought some brushes and changed them.  Pushed started it again, and it began charging.
 
Driving  where you stop and start the bus, or using headlights and tape player, it won't last as long. 
 
You can remove a battery from a bus with a generator while it is running, and it will keep running.
 
I heard someone with a rusty bug had the battery fall out the rusty floorboards, and they lost it on a bumpy gravel road.
