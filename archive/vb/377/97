Subject: Which Heater?

Here are a couple of links to some ads on The Samba that I was checking out. They are ads for gas powered heaters and I'm not sure which one would either be the right one for my 63 or the one that has the best track record as far as reliability? Wondering if anybody with heater experience had any input?
