Sorry about the previous post with the wrong subject line.  Guess I'm

 Ups:
 Perfect weather
 Great folks
 Great food
 Terrific Raffle (would have been better if I won something! :)
 Nice swaps
 Interesting entertainment watching the honeywagon get unstuck on the beach

 Downs:
 The idiot who kicked in the bathroom door.
 The nasty headwinds on I-40 all the way from the CA border to Victorville
 and beyond.

 Many thanks to the London Bridge Bullis and everyone else who pitched in
 to make this event so much fun!
