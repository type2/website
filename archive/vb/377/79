Put your meter on resistance (ohms) and connect it between the metal
flange of the sender and the terminal that should go to the gas gauge.
As you work the float up and down, the meter reading should change.

You can also try connecting one lead of your meter to the metal flange
(or the gas gauge terminal) and touching the other to the thin wire
along its length.  You should get a non-infinite resistance value that
changes as you move along the thin wire.  If you get a changing
resistance and then infinite resistance (open circuit), the thin wire is
broken somewhere.
