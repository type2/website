Subject: Accelerator Cable

Hey everyone,

I had an exciting weekend, finally got the bus fired up so will soon
be on the road.

I was attempting to replace the accelerator cable this weekend but was
unable to get it to feed all the way through the tube and was hoping
to get some advice on how best to approach this issue without having
to cut or replace the tube. (unless that is truly the best and or
easiest method.)

There was a cable in the tube when I started, but as my bus was a
watercooled GM when I started working on it, the cable was a very
light and flimsy type cable.

Thanks
