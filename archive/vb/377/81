Well, that was 1991, and the bus charged just fine for about a year until I sold it. 
I seem to rember the commutator looking fine, but it was a while ago.
 
I don't see how the worn out brushes would damage the generator.   They are just little square of coarbon AFAICT, and when worn down they just don't push against the commutator.   I wouldn't go and swap out for a alternator instead of replacing a $7 pair of brushes.   The brushes are tricky to install (at least the lower one) but less hassle than pulling the gen.  
 
Maybe you commutator was pitted when you got that engine, which wore the brushes out.   I can see how a pitted commutator would weear out brushes, but not the other way around.

If you run that long with bad brushes in a generator, you have likely
severely pitted the commutator.  You can replace the brushes and the
generator will then work, but the brushes will wear out very fast.  At
least that was my experience when I did it.

My solution was to replace generator with alternator.
