Subject: Can you name this tune? Vanagon Video

Hello Fellow Volks Folks,

This is a little different request. I like this song in this Vanagon video
but do not know who the artist is. I am hoping you musically inclined bus
drivers can help a brother out. Click on the following link to see two dudes
driving in their Vanagon: http://www.youtube.com/watch.php?v=aE81sEllXVk

 

Wishing you many miles of smiles in your VW!

Todd Olson
