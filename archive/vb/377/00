Has  anybody had this problem before?


Hi Seth,
Yup, BTDT.  Install grounding wires (just like VW  did for 1970 and later 
buses) from each taillight and to where  the ground cable of the battery bolts to 
the body.  Take a GOOD look at the  bulb holders.  Depending on year, 
manufacture, and even the market the bulb  holders were intended, they could be cast 
out of pot metal or made of stamped  steel out of more than one section.  The 
pot metal ones you have to  drill and screw the grounding wires to them.  The 
stamped steel ones are  best done with soldering the grounding wires to the 
steel cylinder that the bulb  goes into.  Not soldering at that area will mean 
that the  grounding has to go through one or more joints in the bulb holder and 
 not do such a good job of it.
  You will be amazed at how much brighter and sharper you running  lights and 
signals are!!
