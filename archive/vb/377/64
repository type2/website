Subject: Re: [VB] Electric vs Mechanical was Electric vs Mechanicle?

This post reminds me of a Puzzler heard on the Car-talk radio program. www.cartalk.com.  One car had a bad charging system and the battery died. It was night and unsafe to drive without lights. The second car ran fine. Using only a pair of pliers, how did they cover the 100 miles home? 
Answer: Swap the batteries between the cars, repeating when the charged battery ran down in the faulty car.
