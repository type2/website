Hi MUD,
If it is a bad flex line more than likely it would be a left side that is  
giving you the grief if it is pulling to the right.  If the  flex lines are more 
than five years old, replace them.
  If it was too tight of MC push rod you would have ALL wheels drag if  
single circuit and in a dual circuit it could be just the wheels of one  axle.
