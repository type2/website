Subject: RE: [VB] Full flow oil filtration vs filterpump

I've used all three brands, actually two of them are the same. I have seen
EMPI stamped pumps that were exactly like the Taiwan ones with an EMPI stamped
cover. Makes you wonder. There are also two favors of each, the pre 71 cam and
the deep dish 71-2003 cam. I have stuck with 30mm gears and reworked nearly
every cover for correct tolerance. The thick cover with the inset for the high
gears needs to be sanded down to get the tolerance needed.

The other method I prefer for my trikes and off road is an external cooler
coming off the oil cooler holes through the shroud and forward of the motor
with the oil filter in that line.

  I have run filter pumps on all my engines and most that I build, up to
1904 cc. I only use CB Performance pumps. Theirs are made in Brazil by
Schadek and have keyed gears and very nice tolerances. Bugpack, SCAT and all
others I have seen out there are made in Taiwan and the quality is fair to
good at the most. CB's are also 26 mm gears where as the Taiwan units use 30
mm gears.
