Hi Scott,
Go through the connections to the wiper and its ground wire, plus take your 
wiper motor out for a complete clean out and repacking with lithium grease in 
all moving parts. Have you soldered all the clips in your fuse box together?  
Do not overtighten the gen/alt belt or risk premature gen/alt bearing failure.  
Additionally go through the procedures in the 1963-67 VW Transporter Shop 
Manual, section E-2, page 14.
