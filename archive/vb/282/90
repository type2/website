Rob,
If you're watching the list I'm in Melbourne over this
weekend(2nd to 5th of October) & really want to link
up with you if I can.
Curt told me about your lovely buses and if you're not
busy and willing to let me have a squiz I'd love to
get together.
Anyone else who reads this and knows Rob's email
address PLEASE send it to me.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
