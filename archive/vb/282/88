If I'm not mistaken, Ronnie may be talking about my 1800.

The dual 34's Ronnie put on my motor have been running flawlessly for 8000+ miles since  mid-June.  Excellent throttle response and good gas mileage.  If I keep it under 65 (rarely) the gas mileage gets even better. I drive my buses hard, on a trip today to LA I ran 70-75mph straight including some hills for about 3.5 hours and still got about 22 mpg.  Once cruising, I have over half of my pedal left.  This thing has cruised 80+mph without a hiccup.  

As for the restrictive muffler, I recently swapped that out with a header and single QP...the top end has really opened up, high speed cruising has been awesome.  It's so great cruising at 70, then stepping on the gas to pass someone doing 75-80mph.  The looks are priceless.  On top of that, this is the coolest running engine I have ever run....absolutley bee-yoo-tee-full!

If I could get off my ass and hook up the chokes, I'll love em even more.

IMHO opinion, the carbs are great for my driving and setup...highly recommended from me.

Just in case anyone is wondering:
1800 stroker, dual 34 Solexes, doghouse, 009, no external coolers or sumps, low compression, Single QP empi header/muffler and a 3:88 Rancho big nut tranny.  One torquey sumbitch!
