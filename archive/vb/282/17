I checked around, and apparently, it is legit. It was a special order for an
Airport. All the airport vehicles were painted bright orange, and this was
ordered for this purpose. Don't know if it was used to transport airport
personel around the tarmac, or for shuttling customers around though. It is
original paint, no hacked in panels or anything. It truley is a factory one
of a kind. At least, that's the story I got from a few different sources.
I'm sure it didn't come lowered with chrome bumpers and centerlines, but the
body is still OG.  :-)
