Well, yea, but it remains the same, the oil needs a LOT of miles put on it
before it becomes an issue.

Also, believe it or not, modern cars run higher oil temps than our VW's do.
Unless the VW in question is missing tin and seals.  :-)  The heat that our
engine's put on the oil is not an issue in this day and age.
