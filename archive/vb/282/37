Do what Eric&Barb said.  Also, the only H7 bulbs I can find data on are
single filament bulbs; do you not have high beams or are you using H7
driving lights in addition to your regular headlights?  If you're using
H7s instead of your regular headlights, the load is about 30 watts (2.5
amps) more than stock, which is probably OK.  If you're using H7s in
addition to your regular headlights, you're using about 110 watts (9.2
amps) more than stock, which might be enough to cause problems.
