Good post.  Thanks!

I want to add: those figures like "8G" and "10K" that appear in the
Bentley and the parts lists can easily be translated to modern bolt
strength markings.  From
http://www.americanfastener.com/technical/metric.asp :

New Designation 4.6  4.8  5.6  5.8  6.6  6.8  6.9  8.8  10.9  12.9  14.9
Formerly        4D   4S   5D   5S   6D   6S   6G   8G   10K   12K   --

The chart also claims that 8G/8.8 is equivalent to a US grade 5 bolt,
and 10K/10.9 is equivalent to a US grade 8 bolt.  8.8/8G are the
"standard" metric bolts you can get at the hardware store; 10.9 should
be easy to get and 12.9 relatively easy to get.  The upper front shock
absorber mounting bolts on my Bus are grade 12K.
