I got a set from AJ and when I opened the box, the secondary venturi was
rattling loose in the box.

I've run ICT's, and I've run Kadrons, and personally, I like the ICT's a LOT
more. The quality is much better IMHO. The Kadrons are more popular though
due to the racing AJ has been doing with them.

I would recommend checking both carbs (ICT's and Kads) side by side before
you purchase, if you haven't already.
