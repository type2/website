Subject: RE: [VB] Springplate-Reduction Box Bolts: An Observation

You say you used original Grade 8.8 bolts on one side with the
lockplates, yet they still loosened up?  I went through something
similar quite some time ago, so I went back to the Archives and found my
report of my travails at
http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/001615.html.  

Bentley calls out using a Grade 10 bolt for this application.  This is
equivalent to an SAE grade 8, which is what you would be looking for in
the US, even if you are buying metric bolts, but original, German bolts
would not have 8.8 stamped on the head (German bolts marked like this
would not be strong enough).  

If I recall, I used bolts with the 8.8 marking and I had two of the four
bolts break off and the remaining two wallowed out their holes.  I had
to take the Reduction Box off and have the broken bolts (along with my
broken easy out) EDM'ed (Electrical Discharge Machining) out and had
Timeserts put in to be able to use metric bolts of the correct size (I
bought slightly longer ones to fully utilize the thread depth).

If you have lockplates, the bolts can't turn, therefore the only way
they can loosen is to stretch.  I would highly recommend replacing those
8.8 bolts with a higher quality set.

Good luck!
