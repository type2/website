i think you will be amused by the finished product... UNLESS the film 
has a decent director!
the 70 and i spent a whole month on the set of disney's 'the big 
green,' and were shot prominently in several scenes.
when the movie came out, not only was the bus visible for all of 3 
10-second shots, it wasn't even the same MOVIE they initially shot.
literally, there were over 4 hours of scenes and plot that were cut. 
it made a bad movie even worse.
still, we got to eat the same stuff the crew did (ALWAYS say you are 
'a driver;' if you admit to being an extra you get beanie weenies. 
crew had shrimp scampi!) and i got $1200.

i heartily endorse going to your local/state film office - texas and 
new york have em for sure - and leave photos and descriptions of your 
'classic' car. they will shop it to any production looking for 
similar things... period cars, specific models, junkers, whatever.

but DO NOT let them PAINT the car!!!  my old bus (then rex's, then 
the english guy's) - was painted with housepaint, with rollers, on 
the set of 'michael.'
