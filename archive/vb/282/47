Subject: Re: Springplate-Reduction Box Bolts: An Observation

Hey Karmax8g,

  Interesting post, about 5 yrs ago I experianced the clunk sound on the
passengers side of the transaxle.  I asked the list for help and checked
the archives, the suggestions were to check the springplates, mounts,
reduction gear bearings.

  I did notice when removing the bolts on the springplate to reduction
gear boxes that they were either torqued so much that I broke off the head
and had to easy-out the bolt, to some of the bolts were stripped and
barely holding on by a few threads.

  I followed E&B's advice on using longer time certs, checked the torsion
bars, put new rubber mounts in and rebuilt the reduction gears.

  Suprinsingly the clunk sound disappeared for a few thousand miles and
then reappeared.  I believe the cause now is the axles, side gears and
fulcrum plates, presumably due to the original loose springplate to
reduction gear bolts.  So the moral of the story is these bolts can cause
hidden failures of many key, expensive, hard to get to, parts on your Type
II so get it right the first time, or pay in the future.

Best,
