Subject: trans replacement questions #3 (drums)

Thanks for the responses to #1 and 2.

I'm a split bus rookie with only 3 months under my belt going at some pretty major stuff for me, weekend warrior style.

I need a rear drum. I've heard the repops can be bad.
Busboys has used ones for around 35 bucks.

Anybody done this or have a comment?

The other side is a repop drum. I assume I should have them machined to the same tolerances?

Billy
