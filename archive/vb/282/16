Perhaps someone knows more about this bus than I do, but it is a genuine double slider deluxe.  I even think the color is original.  It used to be an airline shuttle bus way back in the day.  I've got some pictures of this bus before it was slammed and turned into a moblie DJ stand and it had a roof light and special kind of clock (kinda like a taxi) inside.  So far as I know, it's not a hack job.
