ronnie - i talked to BAP today... they are going to look over my 
motor. guy stated that they have had to ream out almost ALL the oil 
piston passages on the motors they built. that might explain my 
excess oil pressure, and my suspicion that the oil is not  getting to 
the cooler, leading to the HOT case yet cool heads.
they also are going to try and track down my odd noise... he said the 
dizzy bore was seizing up on some of them, so maybe there, or just 
some valve train noise i haven't sniffed out.

cross your fingers.
