Subject: Which Engine for a '62 ?

Thank you for the info on my previous message.

I now have the number range for the right VW engine corresponding to the
body,

But no answers about my 2nd question :

"has anyone got some info on VEGE rebuilt engines ?"

Does that mean that VEGE engines are not distributed in the US ?

Thanks

Bertrand.
