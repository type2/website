Subject: John Brown's Buses

John Browns's Buses is only two weeks away in Harpers Ferry, West 
Virginia.  There has been a great response from folks who plan to 
come.  Make sure you make reservations at Harpers Ferry KOA.  I have 
blocked out an entire loop for the event, but KOA will only keep them 
available to us until the 7th of October unless deposits are made.  Make 
your plans and give them a call 1-800 562-9497 or 304-535-6895.  For info 
on the camp out, go to http://www.johnbrownsbuses.com .  Come join the 
camaraderie, the changing of the leaves, and one of the last camp outs of 
the season.  Hope to see you there!
