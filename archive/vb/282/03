I changed my nine prong box to the NOS 11/75 one I had around thanks to the
information from Matt, Barb and Eric.
The turn signal on the old red box was hanging up and I was getting occasional
red lights from the generator light at speed on and off. Having said that this
never seemed to affect the battery level. AS the cranking power was the same
and the bus would start right up every time.

So that has stopped.... but at night with lights on, I still get very faint
red glow when brakes are applied or turn signal is used. But a big red is when
the wiper motor is pulled on. I have a Bosch alternator with just 20,000 miles
on it, belt tight, and possible extra demand from Hella H-7's.

Any ideas??
