Subject: Steering box seals

Does anyone know where to get the grease seal and gaskets for the steering box on a bus?  The one I have is a ZE or ZF or something like that (I'm at work and don't remember).  I've got mine all apart and all the hard parts look good and tight, but the oil seal for the output (?) shaft is bad and I'ld like to replace it and the gaskets if there are any (It didn't seem like there was one on the large side cover, but there seemed to be a couple of metal 'shims' with a gasket between them on the smaller lower cover.  I already tried WW's website and they say they sell a 'rebuild kit' for the steering box for $175, that includes all the hard parts.....except that it is unavailable.  

Anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated,
