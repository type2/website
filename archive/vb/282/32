Earlier this week I finished out some more of the interior ceiling of 
my shop and wired up a couple more lights. I've got 3 of the 5 done 
and basically ran out of supplies and cash for that particular part. 
Plywood prices are through the roof right now down here in Texas!!!

So I brought my big compressor in from the ranch. Man that thing is 
heavy! I found a spot for it in my 10' X 20' "parts building" that 
sits about 10 ft. from my new garage/shop. I had already run the 
wires for electricity under ground to the "parts building". So I 
finished up the wiring to the compressor, flipped the breaker, & 
turned on the compressor. It works great!

I still have to finish up the air lines. I had already run those 
under ground as well...just need to connect up to the compressor and 
put an outlet in the garage/shop. I won't pipe the whole shop until I 
get done finishing out the interior. But I'll at least have the one 
air outlet and with my air hose it's really plenty. The others will 
be just for luxery.

It's cool having the air compressor in the other building because I 
won't have the compressor noise to listen to when I'm working on the 
VW's! I hope to finish this little project off this week. Like Craig 
K said, it feels like when I need to work on a car I'm using an ax 
and a big stick. So I guess I'm spoiled. Who cares though. I do this 
crap for fun. So I make it more fun to do before I do it!
