Hi Michael,
The oil/filter pump has no flex oil lines to blow up, and other than the 
filter screw on connection is just as safe to use as a normal stock VW oil pump as 
long as it is a quality made item (Not Bugpack!!!).  Some wonder if the oil 
filter next to the muffler will increase oil temps, but so far on two engines 
we have not noticed any increase in before/after engine oil temps when 
installing these oil/filter pumps.

That is the best of the best!  Wish we could find more of those, both because 
the machining and engineering are far superior to anything made today and the 
filter is on the right side.  The modern day made oil/filter pumps have the 
filter on the left side of the oil pump and thusly the filter interferes with 
the stock left side muffler heat riser tube.  To fix this we have cut/weld into 
a downward angle the neck of the oil/filter pump cover so as to allow the use 
of the stock muffler.
