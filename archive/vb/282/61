Subject: grease seal orientation

First of all, I'd like to say how much I apreciate everyone's help and advise.
I'd be nowhere without this group. Someday I hope to be offering more help
than I beg.

Now to my new problem. I'm installing new inner bearings on my front wheels
and I have these new-er rubber grease seals. How are these installed? With the
flat side toward the backing plate, or with the open/spring side toward the
backing plate?

The subject is mentioned in the archives, but never given a straight answer.

Thanks again,
Rocco
