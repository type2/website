Subject: Re: [VB] trans replacement questions #3 (drums)

I put repop new drums on my 61. (64-67 brakes) Then the brakes kinda 
shuddered.  I had new shoes too.   I thought they'd wear in, but never did, so I put 
the old VW drums back on and the shuddering when braking went away.    I don't 
get it.  Evidently a passenger wouldn't feel it, but I could feel it under my 
foot if I braked medium (hard didn't do it).   

I'd say tell the list where you are, maybe someone local has a spare drum.

I never bothered to measure drums.  Maybe I should have.   but I haven't.  I 
don't get them turned unless they are grooved

congrats on the initiation through fire.  wooo-hooo!

I need a rear drum. I've heard the repops can be bad.
Busboys has used ones for around 35 bucks.

Anybody done this or have a comment?

The other side is a repop drum. I assume I should have them machined to the 
same tolerances?
