OK, I'll argue :) I admit that the amount of info out there is
somewhat dated & could even be wrong in some situations, but from what
I have seen and read about dino multi-vis oils is this.

to get the oil to do neat stuff like act like one weight at one temp
then act like a completely different weight when it gets hot requires
some additives. Apparently it's the additives that have the problem
with breaking down. Heat is what causes these additives to break down
and no longer function as they should. I can't find the website that
actually stated what temp the additives broke down at, but something
like 260 degrees F. (which is real hot, but whos to say that some oil
actually reached that temp anyway somewere in the oil path). So I'd
say that the issue w/ the breakdown is more about oil temps than it
actually "wearing out". just my $.02
