It is your lucky day.  Go look at page 267 of the '58-'67 parts manual
at http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ .  If callout number 5 is the
thing you want, it's a Normteile (standard part), in this case a "Seal
A 25 x 36 x 7".  In all likelihood, this means 25 mm ID, 36 mm OD, and
7 mm thickness.  I don't know what the "A" means.  The Normteile number
is N 14 907 1.  Anyway, a competent FLAPS or industrial supply house
should be able to turn that number into something you can actually
buy.

A bit of Googling finds Chicago Rawhide, which is apparently now part
of SKF.  Their parts looker-upper is at
http://www2.chicago-rawhide.com/parts_lookup_457010.htm ; the only
25 x 36 x 7 mm seal it has is a Chicago Rawhide 9710.  (Tip: NAPA
often carries Chicago Rawhide seals...)

Back to the parts list, there is a gasket (211 415 135 A) for the side
cover, but no big gasket for the bottom cover -- only the shims you
found.  There are little seals under each of the 4 bolts on the bottom
cover - N 13 804 2, Gasket A 6x10, which means 6 mm ID and 10 mm OD.

In the Bentley (page V-9 7), they don't mention a gasket for the side
cover, just "sealing compound".  They also say that the "seals" around
the four bolts on the bottom cover are really lock washers.  If you
don't have a Bentley, I strongly recommend getting one.

ZF, which is short for Fredericksport Toothed Wheel Factory.  VW wouldn't
let them print the name all the way up the column, so they just put ZF
on the gear base.
