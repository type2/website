Subject: Stock tranny source?

Reading of the archives and tech suggests Rancho is The God for rebuilt
trans for my '65.  I see Ronnie carries 'em, also someone said Kustom1
does ($295).  Who did you deal with that you liked?

This is for a 65 that pops out of reverse (a lot).  I'll need to be able
to bolt up a 12v motor, which is a 1600sp so I don't think a freeway flyer
is such a good idea for me (?opinions?).  Just looking for a good stock
rebuild, hopefully w/nosecone - from the docs I think I can handle the
axle r&r.

Thanks,
Joe
