One could make the same statement about using the wasserboxer case,
offsetting the stud holes, etc.  We're already doing engineering, so why
not consider all the options?

Let's do the math.  A 5mm offset on a 20cm long stud is an angle of 1.43
degrees.  The slant distance is 0.06mm longer (20.006cm as opposed to
20.000cm).  I sincerly doubt that the spring rate will be affected at
all.

In this case the stud is very close to being straight to begin with.

With the angles involved, it won't be lifting any more than straight
studs.

You will be getting a sideways component on the case that you didn't have
before.  If we use your 2-ton figure, the additional stress will be 12.5
pounds directed toward the cylinder bore.  I have a feeling that the much
meatier case around the cylinder stud will be able to handle an additional
12.5 pound load.

Considering the extremely small offset required here, I don't see how it
would affect had sealing or overstress the case in the radial direction.
If we were talking 10 or 15 degrees of offset I'd be worried, but less
than two degrees won't be a concern.
