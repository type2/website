Subject: center brakelight/body work

Hi everyone, 
   Does anybody have a center brakelight&assembly for a 56/57 singlecab? 
thats the last original piece I need for this puppy!  Also its almost time to 
send it out for some bodywork by someone who knows what they are doing. 
Nobody around here (Chicago area) has even seen one, I asked this question a 
few months ago and checked out the leads but nothing has proved to be worth 
persuing. I am almost ready to contact either someone in Cal or Kelly in S.C. 
                                               thanks    Steve 57 singlecab 
(early)
