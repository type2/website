I think that that is true of the household batteries (AAA, AA, C, D cell
batteries) that are improperly disposed of; in the trash can then to the
land fill.  The batteries that start cars and power ev's are required by law
to be recycled.  As with any product, there are places in the world that
manufacture or in the case of batteries, remanufacture products in an
irresponsible fashion.  There are countries that have lead smelting
operation that are environmental nightmares, just as there are similar
chemical plants, refineries etc.  The lead recycling that takes place in the
US is under very strict regulation.  While I can't guantee that all
batteries that are used in the US are recycled in the US, I can purchase my
batteries from a company that manufactures and reclaims its lead in the US.
In my case, the Concorde Batteries are recycled in Los Angeles in an
environmentally responsible way.  Attached are a few links of interest.  As
for the air pollution from charging the batteries, the power used to charge
my bus is roughly equal to having a second refrigerator in my home.  Even
with a coal fired power plant, the additional pollution is a fraction of
what comes out of the tailpipe.
