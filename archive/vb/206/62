Not the dogs, but I might consider a Weimaraner or German Shorthair. Anyway, this weekend i'm going to install new spindles, link pins, tie rod assemblies and possible change the torsion arm seals. The bentley looks pretty straight forward but I am a little confused about the shim/degree measurement thing. What do I need to do all of this?
