yeah, stan w said that as well... oddly, it turned ovah like buttah! 
i've got the mic specs around here - ok, my cam measured 0.984"  and 
spec is  .9837-.9842. so that should be ok. i have to fool around and 
see what tools i can use to measure the case bore.

now, there was a -slight- and i mean you had to pay attention to feel 
it - bind at 30 deg after TDC and 30 deg before BDC that remains 
unexplained... but the local 'good' vw shop manager said he didn't 
think it was a problem; he'd run with worse.  perhaps ronnie is 
right, and the crank gear has a glitch, and this  was causing the cam 
to move.
the only other explanation i've seen is a man who had to REBORE his 
AL case crankbore, as his was not straight. :P
