Subject: help on engine black paint

Hi All,

I'm getting ready to paint some engine tin and I went down to my paint
friends shop yesterday to discuss the possibilities.  Powder coating is
definitely OUT of the question as I really dislike the plastic coat look.  I
asked him for something gas and oil resistant and he suggested some Dupont
product but continued to say it too ended up quite thick.  So, we back
tracked and discussed lacquer and the like.  We went out side and lifted the
decklid of the tipper and I showed him the og paint fan shroud and said that
is what I wanted.  He's looking into it but I also thought I would post up
to the list for suggestions as well.

... btw, the motor isn't for the double cab... just a practice motor going
in my ghia.

TIA
David
