Hi Volksvan,
Definitely sounds like a good idea to take the carb apart for a good cleaning 
out and inspection of parts.  Also check your fuel pump and for proper fuel 
pump rod hieght.  We once had a engine fuel starvation problem near home and 
had to lug the engine a bit due to not being able to do high RPMs before 
upshifting.  Turned out the lower spring in the fuel pump had failed and 
thusly the diaphram could not flex fast enough back into the released postion 
before the next stroke from the fuel pump rod came up.
