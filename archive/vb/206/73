Subject: soldering fuse box

well i just got a spare fuse box-and was planning on soldering this guy
together, and realized it is not for a bus-but more likely an early bug. I
may be able to take it apart, and clean everything, and put it back together
in a "bus" configuration. then solder it together.

now I was just reviewing the previous questions I posted about soldering.
How did you guys get flux into the fuse box...i was thinking a toothpick or
something like that.

I imagine if I try to solder the connections with the fuse box apart-it till
be impossible to get it back together again.
