Hi List,
Well, it happened. Twas driving down the road and an
SUV came bustin' out of Sam's and hit my double cab in
the left rear side, caved in the fender well against
the wheel, and being an SUV, was tall enough that it
got my side gate on the left side. Does any one have
or know where I can get a good left gate for a 63
double cab? If so, please let me know asap so I can
complete my estimate to give to the dreaded insurance
company.
Thanks,
3DPete
