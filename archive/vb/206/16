Subject: Severe Hesitation

Hi all,

My 60' kombi is giving me some fits.  It severaly hesitates when accelerating 
under load..ie when shifting from 2nd to third going up a slight incline.  
Carb rebuilt (28pci), new points, condenser.  It hase been timed correctly , 
and the points and valves adjusted.  I'm thinking of trying a larger main 
jet.  The one in there now is the original 117.5.  It appears that there is 
not sufficient fuel delivery when the velocity of the air through the carb is 
reduced.  (reduced vacuum)  For example, it starts fine, idles perfect, and 
starts off great.  I can climb any hill in first gear, shift to higher gear 
and the hesitation begins.  Could it still be a timing issue??  I have 
checked it both statically and with a strobe.  My dizzy is advancing.  Do you 
think a larger main, maybe a 122 would help or should i start experimenting 
with different jets.
