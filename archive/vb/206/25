Subject: Re: [VB] Wasserboxer conversion versus after market type 1

One could make the same statement about using the wasserboxer case,
offsetting the stud holes, etc.  We're already doing engineering, so why
not consider all the options?
--------------------- Clip -----------------------
There is a Denmark web site that chronicles the Wasserboxer case
conversion to an air cooled with big bore kit, custom oil coolers, custom
heads etc.
It might be found in the Vanagon Archives for about July 2002 (sounds
right).
This guy does it all and has it all laid out with specifications,
dimensions ......... the works.
I have a picture of his custom oil cooler if anyone is interested. I'll
look at the picture and the date I saved it should tell me the date in
the Vanagon archives to search.
