Subject: Severe Hesitation

I thought about the coil but it tested out ok.  I thinkt its more carb 
related since to stop the hesitation I  simply pull out my manual choke a tad 
dunping mor cas down the carb.  Not good for the engine long term.  Seems to 
be a fuel starvation problem mor than anything else.
