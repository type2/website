Silly question, if the part was originally not powder coated, how could
the concours judges accept it with powder coating?

I suppose the rules are different for the Porsche folks.

I remember going to a Model A show and watching the judges
crawling under the cars to check that the few bolts that were supposd to
be galvanized were in the correct places.  If the plating was correct,
they would then check the head markings!  Shows were won or lost based
upon having the correct bolt head markings last made in the 1920s!
