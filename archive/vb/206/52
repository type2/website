Subject: Gas tank divider panels SC/DC

   I know this has come up before but now I am really wondering. Did single
cabs and double cabs use the same gas tank dividers? Also what year,
actually month, did they change styles.

   Here is why I ask, my 59 SC ( built,august 59, 505 701) has what you call
early (as per David Mayes), my 60 DC , (built, april 1960, 610 855), has
what you call mid (as per David Mayes). So now we know that sometime between
august of 1959 and april of 1960 they changed, BUT WHEN and is there a
difference beteen SC and DC
