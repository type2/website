Sounds like you got a 1500 SP gasket kit. The copper intake manifold sealing
rings ARE larger in the 1500 kit than the 40 HP kit. The correct ring size
should fit just inside the head intake hole ledge and when compressed fill the
area sealing it, same as the 1500 SP.

So I'm putting my engine back together and things look good.  But ... does
the
metal ring kinda gasket got right inside of the head and then does the
manifold fit right inside of that hole and crush down that gasket?  The metal
rings that I got in the engine gasket kit is too big to fit inside of that
hole.  They are just a tiny bit too large.  Confused ... OK.  My 40 hp heads
are single port and I'm taking about the gasket that goes between the head
and
the pipes that come from my carburetor to fasten on to the heads.
