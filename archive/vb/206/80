i think the place to find it is in the gear oil section. i remember trying
to find it, and whenever i looked for transmission fluid the stores had
either automatic transmission fluid, or gl-5, then looking for something
else i stumbled across a section for gear oil. i had asked them a couple
times, and they said "it doesn't matter...blah blah blah, i get paid minimum
wage, I don't care...."

I think their is this stuff called redline, or maybe that is a
manufacturer-they make a synthetic that is gl-4 compatible. I have been
thinking of switching over, but have not gotten around to it. I think you
can order it over the internet...check the archives....and NAPA should carry
a GL-4 gear oil, they just don't want to look for you.

sorry i don't have the part number for their GL-4 stuff.
