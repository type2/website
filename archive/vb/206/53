I trudged through the mud with a small toolbox to the place they said teh VWs 
were.   down the left tranck, and take a right near the back fence.   Near a 
tree there were 3 splitties!   one had a como green interior which I started 
stripping.  Looked like 3 standards or 2 standard and a kombi, 62-65 range.  
one was turkois/bw.   one was sort of muddy grey blotch colour.  The buses 
were pretty rusty, some dents, and had been here a long time, so the engines, 
emblems and most door handles were gone.  But there was plenty of splitty 
bits that can be hard to find.   I still checking out the scene.  some thing 
catches my eye to on side.  It's a 2/3 middle seat., 62 63ish in the grey 
standard upholstery but spray painted over.   wow.   I wonder what I 'll have 
to pay for this stuff.  hm, the bus would be full of muddy stuff....

dark...   head feels funny... blink....
it's almost dawn, getting grey out.   Huh..
what?...  Oh, I'm awake.
