Hm, I'd think there'd be something wrong with a clutch slipping at 3200K.

 It was a daily driver until I started Hot Rodding it around town and now
 the clutch starts slipping about 3200 rpms (guess that is peak output on
 the engine). Its still a driver but I just can't run faster than 60 in
 4th gear before it starts to slip. >>
