Subject: re:engine tin

I am not calling it super tin, that is just the name given by CB, based on
the description given, i thought this might be what he is talking about.

i guess given what you have said, that I could take the tin off my type3 and
put it on my bus? I guess  I should just check the archives...

"Super Tin?
Its just a cheap repro of type 3 tins.
They replace the little deflector.
If you check the archives there has been plenty of discussion in the
past.
