Subject: Re: [VB] Gas tank divider panels SC/DC

All 50's have had the early style so far. sometime in the early 1960s it changed to the mid style,
but the change has not been steady when looking at diff early 60's models. The later change came
around 66/67.
Its just like the slash/pointed bumper change BS with the 'use remaining supply' etc for both
changes, except we have no dates to even compare to like bumpers.

There is no diff in DC and SC panels.
