Subject: Cleaning solvent question.

What do folks like to use when cleaning off the really icky thick caked on
grease soaked stuff that resides on front ends and transmission houseings?
I have tried the simple green crystal industrial and that is almost useless.
Are the limonene mixtures any good? Or should I go back to old petroleum
standby's. Kerosene, laquer thinner, paint thnner etc.
