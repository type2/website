Hm, I'd think there'd be something wrong with a clutch slipping at 3200K.
 
--------------------------- Clip -----------------------
I don't want to be a wise arse but even Ray Charles could see that the
disk and pressure plate need to be replaced.
I don't deny that.
Its just a matter of procrastination on my part with morning temperatures
around 25 degrees and afternoon temps about 45 degrees (f).
Continued driving on this clutch will result in farther damage to the
flywheel and possibly the throw out bearing actuator arm (Ugh!).
I'll be getting around to installing the new parts very soon.
With the weird combination of a 71 engine and a 69-74 tranny I'm going to
have to have the old parts out and identified before I order new parts (a
week on blocks in my drive way).
I do appreciate your continued interest and your comments are always
welcome.
