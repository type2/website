I've got a freeway flyer in my '67 right now, and it's currently running a
1600sp.  My opinion would be that unless you live in a very mountainous
region of the country, go with a freeway flyer.  The 1600sp does fine for
motivating a bus with a freeway flyer, but I wouldn't try with anything
smaller than a 1600.  Good luck.
