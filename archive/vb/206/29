Subject: Single cab reassembly time and I need...

Hello list,

It's good to be back after a couple years off the list.

My '65 single cab finally got painted and now it's time to put it back
together.  To do the job right I need screws for the gate hinges, the
treasure chest door hinges and engine lid hinges.  Who has boxes of correct
screws from poor parted out buses that might help me out?  Let me know off
list what you have.  TIA

Regards,

Ed
