Subject: RE: [VB] Wasserboxer conversion versus aftermarket type 1

+ Anyway the way I see it the T5 blows away a T4 conversion or the new nasty

What you want here is fitting a Vanagon 2.1L engine in a splittie  (or even in
a Baywindows

What about the water cool stuff,  ... need to  make room for the radiator no
?

I've heard once from a Vw fanatic here in my region that the Vanagon Crank
could be use in the type 1 Engine as these are very similar .
