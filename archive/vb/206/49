Subject: early gas tank divider once more

Still trolling and getting desperate... I have pieces into the paint shop to
be painted blue either late this week or early next and would love to find a
nice gas tank divider panel... I have a reasonable early divider for partial
trade or a pair of rough divider panels for partial trade or I'd offer 100
for a nice one.  If I wait longer, it will cost me additional cash just to
get it painted so if 100 isn't enough, lets talk.

Note, a truly original pickup would have these divider plates in primer and
slight overspray... but since the 59 dc is a hack, what the hell :-)~


on both knees....
