Hey Stan, I could not find it in the archives... Is that the right date? 
Thanks for your help.

the initial conversions are probably machinists and did stud-insert
relocating more because they could than because it was really required<

I agree with that George.  I think it is possible, just depends on how much 
work is envolved.

Here is a good picture:

Note that these are 14mm inserts instead of the stock 10mm so the holes are 
bored out for the eccentric bolts.

Still more to come...
