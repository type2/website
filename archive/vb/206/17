Subject: RE: [VB] Question for the PNW-ers -Update 

Funny thing watching the wipers whipping around w/o the drop.  It is about 5
times as fast as the past . . .S L O W. . . speed.  I now HEAR the motor.
I'll tear it apart at some point in the near future.  Until then, I'll only
use the wipers when I HAVE TO.  RainX application to follow shortly. . .

 - Thanks
