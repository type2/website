Subject: Re: [VB] Gas Heater Info

Contact Rick Taylor at busbarn(-at-)Prodigy.net for info on Stewart Warner Gas
heaters and parts (he was the guy in the seminar)
or contact Pink Newell at pinkNEWELL(-at-)aol.com for info on Seminar tapes or
info packets and manuals
The seminar was mostly on Stewart Warner SouthWind gas heaters but there was
a little info on the Ebersprachers
