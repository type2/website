The best thing to do is to take it to your local self wash car was that has a
HIGH pressure wash and get down and wet and spray off as much as you can
before doing the fine stuff at home. Next best thing is to rent a pressure
washer and use some biodegradable soap to get it off, preferably where you
don't usually park!

What do folks like to use when cleaning off the really icky thick caked on
grease soaked stuff that resides on front ends and transmission houseings?
I have tried the simple green crystal industrial and that is almost useless.
Are the limonene mixtures any good? Or should I go back to old petroleum
standby's. Kerosene, laquer thinner, paint thnner etc.
