I am interested in a product that is gas and oil resistant....
that's the question.

The easy out is to use Rustoleum in the spray can or by the bulk can.
I've had and used it on many Vanagons and fuel / oil doesn't hurt it.
It has stood up to the heat above the muffler and on heat exchanger
exteriors for 8 years.
You might just paint a few test pieces and try them for a week before you
make your final decision.
