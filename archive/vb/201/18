Subject: Front end Q's

Well, i bought the link pin set for my bus and soon I
will be needing some new spindles as well. Mine are
shot! I was also thinking that since I was down there
I should do the steering pivot and possibly replace
the steering box. How big of a pain is it to change
out the steering box? I have at least 7-8" of play an
i have tried to adjust it out! What about suppliers
too? Any suggestions. I am in CA (north)
