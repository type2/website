Subject: Re: [VB] Anybody have a good heater?

Hi I am a newby to this list so this is my first post I have been watching from the sidelines for some time, but I have a 66 Panel that the stock heat that will keep you toasty.  My first sugestion would be to make shure all your window and door seals are good. Then all your engine tin and engine to body seal is good then replace the two black heater carbord heater hoses and check all your conections from fan shroud to heaterbox to heat channel Also check if the wrap is still on your heater channel under the bus.  Last is your thormosat still working or has it been removed its that little spring looking thing under the  left side push rod tubes with a rod that goes up to the fan shroud  to control the flps that most buses have ben removed.  Also If you reduce the  amount of space you are heating like my cab devider.  Or in a walk thru you can use a sheet of heavy plastic so you are only heating the  cab area this is not good if you have passengers in the back.
