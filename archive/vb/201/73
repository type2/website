Subject: re:horn repair(additional)

actually the way i adjusted it(and got it to work in my basement with some
AA batteries) is to adjust the screw until the tab coming off the contact
points sits just above the level of the "electromagnet"(is this a solenoid,
the thing with a lot of windings of copper and a bunch of metal plates) that
way when the things gets magnetized the metal bar attached to the diaphragm
moves down, causing the contacts to open, releasing the magnetic charge, and
causing the metal bar to move out, which causes the contacts to close
again.hope that makes sense.
