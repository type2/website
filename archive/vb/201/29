Subject: Anybody have a good heater?

Ok, I've got only the stock heater in my '67 13-window, and I'm freezing on
the cold days.  Has anybody been able to make their stock heater be able to
toast them?  I'm not looking to put in a gas heater, so don't suggest that.
But I do want to at least be warm in the winter with my stock heater.  The
heater in my Beetle will burn you the heat is so hot (I measured it once,
170 degrees), but the one in my bus just sucks.  Any ideas?  Thanks for any
input.
