Subject: re:horn repair

well thanks to the archive, i could understand what is going on with the
horn. I put it back together today, with some tiny bolts, and a little
gasket sealant stuff. the kind that does not harden. I should probably
replace the bolts I used with either galvanized or stainless steel, but i
will do that after i get the "boots" that cover the wire connections at the
horn. I need to order those on monday. but toot toot it works, got to use it
today for the guy who tried to make a left hand turn by veering into the
right to swing it wide(i just happened to be in the right lane).
