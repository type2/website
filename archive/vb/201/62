Andrew,

It should be a steady and strong flow, volume-wise. It should not just
trickle. Checkk for obstructions and leaks in your system. Also, renew the
insulation on the ductwork. As Clara said, are the flaps opening all the
way? The doghouse fan output is greater, but the old stock fan is adequate
to get you a good strong flow if all is tight. Insulation on the long run
to the front is vital to save the heat for you.
