If you are near Redding, the Wolfgang guys rebuild the steering boxes and 
spindles, and AFAIK they are the only ones who do.    The most PITA is 
getting the steering wheel off.    Sounds like your bus is dangerous with 
sloppy steering.   are the tie rods etc okay?   Does the steering box thunk?  
 Seems to me that worn ones thunk, can't be all the play in the box. (i hope) 
  attach hose pipe to wallet and smile, unless you can find good used.

 I should do the steering pivot and possibly replace
 the steering box. How big of a pain is it to change
 out the steering box? I have at least 7-8" of play an
 i have tried to adjust it out! What about suppliers
 too? Any suggestions. I am in CA (north)
