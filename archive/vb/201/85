Howdy bus folks...

Just a heads for any So-Cal listees that are interested...
There will about 6-7 (maybe more) buses leaving my place in Temecula Friday 
around noon.  We will be heading up 79 to Beaumont..jump on the I10 to Palm 
Springs then onto the 62 to 29Palms and Parker.....then up the 95 to Havasu.  
We will be meeting up with another bus in 29 Palms for sure.

If anyone wants to leave with us or meet along the way p-mail me for 
directions, phone numbers, etc.

We will also be on CB channel 2.

As for my bus....purring like a kitten. Heading down to get some new tires 
put on in the morning.  Nice all terrain, beefy meats.  205/75/15 in front 
and gonna try out some 215/75/15 in the back and see how much it helps with 
the rpms.  After that a good clean up inside and check the supplies.  Finally 
washed the bastard today......3 months of grime sure does add up on a daily 
driver =)

See you all there.....drop by and say hey.
