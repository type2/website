Subject: Re: [VB] horn repair

My guess it that you need to put it together and adjust it while
connected to a real car or truck battery, to get enough current to drive
the windings inside the horn and activate the 'points' properly. 
Doesn't have to be 'on' the bus, you can use jumpers to hook it up
directly to the battery while you futz with it.

Before you put it together, make sure the adjusting screw is actually
giving you some daylight between the points when you turn it, which you
will need to create the sound.  When I resurrected my OG horn last year
(with help from the Type 2 archives) I found that I first had to
(carefully) bend back that piece of metal to create some distance
between the points.  That piece had lost its springiness and the ability
of the screw to create a gap between the points had completely
disappeared over time.  Once I did that, the adjustment screw once again
did its job in creating the optimum sound volume.
