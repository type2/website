You're another one to talk, Meanley! Fat Chick owner/driver that you are. Come
to Havasu and just TRY and tell me off will you. ;-) The horror would be if I
ever ended up with a vehicle (that I drive) that has both A/C, is not black and
has the power to get out of it's own way.

VW-Volvo related story:
I was in traffic one day driving the '67 Westy when it was ours. While at a
traffic light to change, some business guy in a brand new Volvo 770? 870?
CrossCountry Station pulled up on the drivers side and gave me a thumbs up. In
a real Seinfeld kind of an event I gave the guy a conservative nod and a thumbs
up in regards to his station wagon.
A few weeks later Paula returned from an errand that she had taken in the same
'67 Westy. Someone had left a name and number under the windshield wiper arm.
Thinking that it was again another "hey dood, ya wanna sell da bus?" note I
called. The bus had just been on the market.
Yup, you guessed it. It was the same guy, was not into the VW but was cruising
more than just my neighborhood. DOH! I thanked the guy for the compliment,
reassured him that I was "exit only" and that my wife and kids would never
understand. I referred him out to Chapman VW in Scottsdale and suggested that
maybe they could set his intake.
hahahahaha

Volvos, leather coats with elbow patches, shedding hairy laborador retrievers
in the back and pipe smoking are not my things. Labs are excellent but I have
two dogs already, thanks for asking.
