Subject: re:anybody have a good heater

i would say the biggest difference can be made by closing off the front cab
area, i have cutains separating the front cab fromt he rear. i close them
when driving. i notice a huge temperature difference if i reach behind the
curtains while driving.

other that that-make sure the tube running up to the front of the bus is all
there?

actually i guess the questions should probably go in this order:

1)is the air coming out of the vent hot, and you are just not getting
enough?
-if the air is not hot enough, check that there are no holes in the heating
tubes, or if the pedal splash pan cover is missing, i think that makes a big
difference.
-if the air is hot enough, you just need to make the area it is heating
smaller, ie close your curtains.

2)do you have front and rear heat? i only have front heat, and it blasts a
good amount of hot air. if you have rear heat, maybe there is a way to close
it,so all the heat comes out in the front.

good luck
