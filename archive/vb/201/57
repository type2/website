Subject: re:rattling cargo doors

if you have noise coming form the handle area,maybe the interior handle is
loose. Mine always loosened up on me pretty quickly, so what i did was get
teflon tape(often used for plumbing) wrapped the threads of the screw that
holds the handle in place, the put it together, the handle no longer loosens
at all...well actually with a screwdriver...

hope that might help a little bit.
