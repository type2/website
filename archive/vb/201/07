Hi Kevin,
Yes, oh curious one you can!!!  The outlet of the gas tank is the same size 
and thread count in late 1955 through at least 1979 buses.  We cut off the 
reserve tube of the reserve switch to allow a bit more fuel to be sucked out 
of the tank and this also keeps water from accumilating and rusting out the 
gas tank next to the outlet.  We have found this rust out all too often in VW 
gas tanks and find it alot easier to just drain the carb float bowl of water 
on rare occassion instead of the gas tank.  If one has a reserve switch it is 
wise to run the bus in reserve position every couple of months for at least a 
few minutes.  Not only prevent this water build up, but also from having the 
tiny bit of fuel trapped when kept in normal run postion in the reserve 
switch on the reserve side from turning into jelly and blocking the fuel flow 
when you most need it.
  The 1968-71 bus tanks are the easiest to adapt and install in the 1955-67 
bus.  You just need to cut and weld the seperate gas tank neck to a tighter 
angle or have the rubber neck grommet keep popping loose from the body, bent 
the inlet tube on the tank slightly down, and dent the lower rear center of 
the tank to clear the body flare below the tank that clears the tranny bell 
housing.
