Subject: Re: [VB] movie bus sighting

> Just to let the list know I saw a pre-55 bus in a show.  To see it you
need the dvd version of disney's Swiss Family Robinson.  While on the island
the producers used three military style trucks and one microbus.  Look for
it in the "making of the film".  Just a heads up, seems like no more busses
are in Colorado.

Looks like a '59 or '60 Euro Kombi.
