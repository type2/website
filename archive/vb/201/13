Hi Todd,
For the reserve switch in a 1955-60 not a thing has to be re-engineered.  If 
you want to have a reserve cable in a post-1960 VW bus that is not an 
ambulance you have to weld in the rear cable boden tubing support/clamp from 
a pre-1961 bus and do some drilling for the cable through to the interior.

!

True once you have a reserve switch in place and keep a log book there is 
really little  need for a fuel gauge, but VW did offer an accessory electric 
fuel gauge from about 1955!!  Interestingly the 1955-59 KG used the same 
early fuel gauge, we are not sure if the senders from these will work in 
1955-66 buses though.  We are running a 1968-71 fuel tank and sender in our 
1963 SC that is still running 6 volt system, and with the pre-1967 6 volt 
fuel gauge it works perfectly!
