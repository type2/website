Subject: movie bus sighting

Just to let the list know I saw a pre-55 bus in a
show.  To see it you need the dvd version of disney's
Swiss Family Robinson.  While on the island the
producers used three military style trucks and one
microbus.  Look for it in the "making of the film". 
Just a heads up, seems like no more busses are in Colorado.
