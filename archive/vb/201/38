You need to change the flasher relay (blinkgeber) to the 12 V version.
Probably the simplest thing to do is to get a #559 12 V flasher from
the FLAPS.  This has four terminals, like the original, and will hook
up as follows:

Wire Color                           Was   Is  Purpose
black/white/green+black/purple       +     X   +12 V feed
black/white/green+black/white/green  S     L   Pulsing +12 V to lamps
blue                                 K     P   Switched ground for pilot
(none)                               stud  E   Ground

The original flashers grounded through their mounting stud.  The #559
will have a separate terminal - you need to make up a short wire, at
least 18 gauge and preferably brown, to go from the E terminal to
ground so the pilot light in the speedometer will work.

A 4-terminal flasher from a '70-'72 Bus should also work.  For one of
those, the wiring is:

Wire Color                           Was   Is   Purpose
black/white/green+black/purple       +     +49  +12 V feed
black/white/green+black/white/green  S     49a  Pulsing +12 V to lamps
blue                                 K     KBL  Switched ground for pilot
(none)                               stud  31   Ground

Again, you'll have to add a ground wire for the 31 terminal.

If you use a three-terminal flasher from the FLAPS, the pilot light
in the speedometer may glow dimly, even with the key off.  The best
way to fix this is to re-wire the pilot light: disconnect and tape
off the black wire at the pilot light socket on the back of the
speedometer, and run a new ground wire (at least 18 gauge and
preferably brown) from the body to the socket terminal you just freed
up.  Moving the turn signal power wire at the fuse box from the
"battery" fuse to the "ignition" fuse will also work, but means that
you have to leave the ignition on to get your hazards to work, which
can burn out your coil if you happen to stop the engine with the
points closed.  Rewiring the pilot light bulb is a better option.

You also need to think about the hazard light relay.  It will probably
work for a while on 12 V but it will eventually burn out.  You can
either add a resistor to the coil, or replace it with two generic
relays from the FLAPS.  This relay only gets power when the hazard
lights are on, so you don't _have_ to fix it right away to make your
turn signals work.  Directions for adding the resistor is here:

Good luck!
