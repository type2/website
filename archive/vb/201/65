...Or if it is like my singlecab the heat duct was clogged from the animals
that were living in it.

I solved my issue by cutting a flap in the tube before the bend up he cab
and drove it around for a few weeks.I then screwed a patch in place so I can
easily clean it once in a while.This made a big difference in heat output
and reduced the amount of junk coming out of the heat and defrost ducts.

 was writ:
 "The heat just seems to trickle out of the vents at best, front and rear."

 sounds like you either have a big leak, or the heater flaps are not opening
 all the way, which is restricting flow. if you look where the heater cable
 connects to your heater flaps at the front of your heater boxes-do they
move
 a lot when you open(turn)the heater cable control?

 I think there are usually two point the cable can connect to, i would think
 if you connected your cables to the wrong point, they would not pivot
correctly.
