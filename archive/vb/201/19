Hi Sean,
Are they really worn out or is the slop from other steering/suspension 
components?  Best to check under the bus while a friend wiggles the steering 
wheel back and forth to see what is worn out first, and replace all obviously 
worn parts before guessing that some parts are worn.  
  Center pin replacement is an easy job if you can disconnect the forward 
shift linkage from the rear linkage which can take days to get rusty parts 
apart.  You will need access to an adjustable reamer of proper size with 
taper attachment to align the boring action of the reamer through the twin 
bushings.  If all fails often just replacing the center pin itself will 
remove at least 50% of the slop there and hopefully get your steering down to 
something safe!!!!
  As for the steering box it is a matter of jacking the forward end of the 
bus high enough to allow the steering box to lower out properly.  Always 
disconnect the drag link from the pitman arm!!!!!  Never remove the pitman 
arm unless absolutely needed and if then mark the shaft coming out of the 
steering box and the pitman arm for proper alignment.  Failure to do this can 
result in steering locking up!!!
Check out or buy a Bentley reprint of the 1963-67 VW bus shop manual for more 
info and lots of great pictures.  Plus since you are in N. Cal you have both 
the Bus Boys and Wolfgang Int. for parts and possibly rental reamer.
