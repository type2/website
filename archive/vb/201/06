Hi Mike,
Unless you are going to run the 1959-1/2 through 1960 Bastard 40 HP engine 
the 1963-67 VW bus shop manual will work fine and Bentley sells a reprint of 
this manual.  If you really need the 1960 data, Bentley sells a 1950-1960 of 
those VW bus shop manuals all in one reprint.  Either is worth every cent 
spent.....
