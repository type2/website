Gary,

Tell us the rest of the story:  On the way to the freeway entrance ramp you
and your bus passengers were passed by one Lance Armstrong who happened to be
on a training ride along one of the many lakes in Austin.

Right?

Howdy!

Just wanted to share a Friday Bus moment with the list, I just took myself
and 8 co-workers to lunch in my '66 Deluxe.
