Subject: Re: [VB] Anybody have a good heater?

I have really good heat in my 65 westy.   the only problem I have is that the 
gas milage is getting crappy as these days it sits in the driveway warming up 
about as long as it takes me to drive to school.   Anyway, it does take a few 
minutes for the heat to get hot, but it does, as long as the outside temps 
are above about 35 F.  If it's freezing outside, it still warms the bus up, 
but not as much.

Does the heat blow a good blast of air?  I mean, do you have volume?  front 
and back should be comparable.  You could insulate the heater boxes. is the 
insulation on the tube under the bus all there?  all connections good? when 
the heat is on are the flaps open all the way?

thermostat installed?   That should make the bus warm up more quickly.

 Ok, I've got only the stock heater in my '67 13-window, and I'm freezing on
 the cold days.  Has anybody been able to make their stock heater be able to
 toast them?  I'm not looking to put in a gas heater, so don't suggest that.
 But I do want to at least be warm in the winter with my stock heater.  The
 heater in my Beetle will burn you the heat is so hot (I measured it once,
 170 degrees), but the one in my bus just sucks.  Any ideas?  Thanks for any
 input.
