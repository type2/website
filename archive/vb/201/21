Well I know for a fact the king/links are shot.
There's a whole lotta shaking going on down there,
both on the ground or jacked up. Not to mention tire
wear. I plan on doing the tie-rods too. I am pretty
sure nothing has ever been done to the front since
being assembeled at VW!
 I've had the Bentley for years and it has come in
handy. I knew I needed a reamer too, I just wondered
if it was possible to do the necessary repairs without
needing any "local manufacture" VW specific tools! I
do hope that that fixes or at least helps the problem
because I can't get my steering wheel off anyway!
