sounds like you either have a big leak, or the heater flaps are not opening
all the way, which is restricting flow. if you look where the heater cable
connects to your heater flaps at the front of your heater boxes-do they move
a lot when you open(turn)the heater cable control?

I think there are usually two point the cable can connect to, i would think
if you connected your cables to the wrong point, they would not pivot
correctly.
