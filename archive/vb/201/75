Subject: camping spot Alanta Ga??

Hey listees,

I'm going to be in Atlanta 1/24 and 1/25 and was hoping someone cool  could 
let me camp outside of thier house. I'll either be in my 66 13 window or my 
71 Westy (if it's running by then).

Thanks in advance,

Daniel

PS, I already tried AIRS to no avail.
