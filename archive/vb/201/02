the wiring does not need changing.  

You do need to change the blinkgebers to the equivalent 12V version, along 
with all bulbs (including dash bulbs)  There is the kind you can get generic 
at the FLAPS, and then the other blinkgeber is 4 pin.  Where do you get a 
replacement for that?   Can you use the 311 4 pin 12V boxes.   My 65 was 12V 
when I got it and what's in there still works.
