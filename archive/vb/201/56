Subject: Re: [VB] Anybody have a good heater?

The heat just seems to trickle out of the vents at best, front and rear.
The tube under the bus is there, and the insulation is trying to be there.
I'm going to insulate that better eventually.  All connections are good, and
the flaps are there, but the thermostat is not installed.  I've been
thinking of trying out an extra blower motor to improve the heat, has
anybody had any experience with these?
