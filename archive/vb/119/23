Subject: RE: [VB] Bouncing Needle

Hi,
My 67 Sundial does this too, and has since I got it a year ago.

I kinda chalked it up to starting/stopping/cornering, and the float in the
gas tank going up and down as the gas sloshed around in the tank.  I'll be
interested to hear if anyone has a fix for this one.

Does anyone's speedo needle do the same thing?  Mine bounces all over the
place.

Ed

Just got my bus on the road in the last couple of weeks after being stored
in the garage for the winter. Great to be driving it again!!

However, the needle of the gas gauge will read properly one minute and now
bounce back and forth for 30 seconds at a time. Is it the ground wire?? Sign
of gauge failure???........... It is not related to bumps in the road and
had been working properly the last five years......
