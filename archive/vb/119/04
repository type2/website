Ditto here, still running on OG single circuit MC, got a new Brazillian
one cheap, but now considering the dual MC conversion instead of new
Single. Glad to hear everyone is ok..

After you get yourself dried off, go look at all the wheels and master
cylinder.  You should find a puddle somewhere.  (besides the front
seat)    I need to check out doing the dual circuit conversion
and you are really convincing me.  Seems like you aren't the first to
have this happen.  I figure I could run the cheap Varga wheel cylinders
if I had a dual circuit system.
