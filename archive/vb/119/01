Subject: More Dealer stuff

   I just got back from getting the last of the stuff from the closed down
VW dealer. In this pile of junk I got at least 60 boxes with 35 mm film, 33
1/3 albums and booklets on how to repair VW's. Each box covers a different
year and the repair procedures for these repairs, pretty cool stuff. I'm
looking at the how to adjust the 34 pict 3 carb pamphlet and the timing ones
now, only have 60 more to go.
  Another interesting piece was a book on how to paint your dealership. It
has the scheme and color swatch's for painting the inside and outside of the
dealership. The neat thing is that the showrooms have different colors for
type1,2 and 3 vw's.
   The whole bed of my truck is full of the last rements of what was left
including some NOS heads still in cosmoline. Can anybody tell me how to tell
the difference from a 36 HP head and a 25 hp head??
   There were still a few REAL GOOD things left, but the owner decided to
E-barf instead of selling them to me. Hopefully he'll change his mind as
he's ready to leave for the summer.


ronnie   the search continues

ps. rick, there are a couple boxes with heater repair proceedures
