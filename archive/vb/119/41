Subject: Non-Stock Muffler and Engine Temp

Hey all,

I'm trying to determine if there's some relation between an engine that
breathes better and a lower overall operating temperature.  My camper is
my daily driver and I'm looking into making some small mods this summer
that should help it run within spec on those hot days.	Would running a
nice S&S header and single QP help keep the temps down?

My other plans include an oil temp guage and tach.  Does anyone know of an
oil temp sender that doesn't fit into the sump plate?  It just seems so
exposed there.	And would a 1.5Qt sump make a big difference on a stock
1600?
