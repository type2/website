think the idea is drain gas, and unhook reserve cable from tap

remove gas tank from truck (removing engine and voltage regulator may help 
-or do the DCs access the gas tank from the front like the SCs?)

install later one- after swapping reserve stuff onto it so you can have 
reserve tap AND gas guage...  you may have to mess with the filler pipe.  I'd 
install the wiring  while the old tank is out for better access.  And check 
that the sender on the bay tank works before you install it.

you may have to lengthen the hold down straps  ???  I may not remember all 
the details.   Isn't there a procedure on this in the archives ?
