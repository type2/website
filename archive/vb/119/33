Subject: Re: [VB] Legalities of stamping an engine case

If you had a Mercedes and you put a new short block in it, it comes with no
engine number. Part of the repair procedure is to stamp the original engine
number in to the new one. And yes, there is factory time guide operation code
to do this.
Nothing illegal as far as Mercedes is concerned.
