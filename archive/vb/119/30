Subject: RE: [VB] Dual circuit upgrade

You know, I went through that exercise before I modded my brake system.
After a month of contemplation and many opinions I said, the heck with it,
let's just put it on and SEE what happens. Well, 4 months later and I am
still happy with the extra braking power of the 72-79 dual circuit MC on my
67 SC !

You are right on the formula.  Basic FAP & VAL.  Accordingly, the increased
volume in the larger bore would push more juice down the line, actuating the
brakes earlier, for the same amount of pedal travel.  Wonder if this is why
all the bigger better brake systems have bigger bore sizes then?  I'm
guessing Porsche didn't go bigger to make the brake system on the 6 cylinder
worse than the one on the 4 cylinder.
