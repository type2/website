Subject: Re: [VB] Almost lost the bus


Best to convert to a dual circuit ... I had a similar experience about 
five years ago: Pedal goes to floor, pull on parking brake; Ras Bulli 
Split (66 Westi) and I take a rather invigurating trip through the ditch 
and bounce to a stop ~100yds inside a farmers field ...

shook almost everything loose, and covered the rest with mud.  A bent 
rim was the only real damage ... lucky.

The only problem with the conversion was finding a '67 master cylinder 
.. once I had one the reset was pretty easy.  While this reduces the 
opportunity for complete failure, it does not increase the stopping 
power of those old drums.  I have converted my '74 Thing to disc brakes 
and am complentating the same for the bus.

Bugs & Things and Splits, ... Oh, my!
