My feeling is that the major restriction in the manifold is at the "tee"
below the carb.  The back-and-forth nature of the vacuum signal cannot do
much for flow with the sharp transition here.  Since the runners end up at
the head with a fixed hole size (unless you really want to mod things),
the runners themselves shouldn't have to get much bigger.
