Subject: RE: [VB] Legalities of stamping an engine case

When I rebuilt my 67 Mercedes 230 the block was also without a stamp. The
Mercedes dealer said that when they rebuild and engine they transfer the
original engines code to the new block with an extra three digit number
identifying the year it was replaced. Since I rebuilt my own, it has no
numbers on it. Whoever is driving a 67 230 straight six silver and blue
Mercedes with no engine number, that was probably mine !

If you had a Mercedes and you put a new short block in it, it comes with no
engine number. Part of the repair procedure is to stamp the original engine
number in to the new one. And yes, there is factory time guide operation
code
to do this.
Nothing illegal as far as Mercedes is concerned.
