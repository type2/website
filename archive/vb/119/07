Subject: Re: [VB] Reverse spam: need gas cap


Don't have a gas cap for you but, I do have a DC that I plan to put a bay
tank in. I've got the bay tank and it appears to fit but, on my '65 there is
a vertical support in the middle of the truck where the cover plates for the
gas tank area fit.

On my DC this support is cut-out because I am replacing the cargo floor. I'm
not sure that you will be able to wrestle the bigger bay tank in around that
support or not.
