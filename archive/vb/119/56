Ronnie,
This is great!  I was just composing a message telling you how much I
hated Kadrons, etc. etc.:) and would you have this type of engine around
you might try.  The numbers on your 74X88 were great.  The torque curve
wasn't even a curve.  I'm impressed.  If only it didn't have Kadrons!
Also something I have been interested in is the 34pict/dp manifold with SP
end castings.  I tried this on my 69X88 engine and the quality of the
Taiwanese adaptor end castings was so terrible that I had to give up.  It
doesn't seem like it should be all that hard to figure out some nice steel
tubing type stuff, but maybe I'm wrong.  Do you know of anybody that makes
these adapters in a form that works?
