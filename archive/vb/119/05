Yeh hand brake as a redundancy is not a comforting thought. Let me know =
how the dual cylinder quest goes. If no cutting is required then I am very =

master cylinder as cheap alternative.

After you get yourself dried off, go look at all the wheels and
master cylinder.  You should find a puddle somewhere.  (besides the front
seat)    I need to check out doing the dual circuit conversion
and you are really convincing me.  Seems like you aren't the first to have
this happen.  I figure I could run the cheap Varga wheel cylinders if I
had a dual circuit system.
