You are right on the formula.  Basic FAP & VAL.  Accordingly, the increased
volume in the larger bore would push more juice down the line, actuating the
brakes earlier, for the same amount of pedal travel.  Wonder if this is why
all the bigger better brake systems have bigger bore sizes then?  I'm
guessing Porsche didn't go bigger to make the brake system on the 6 cylinder
worse than the one on the 4 cylinder.
