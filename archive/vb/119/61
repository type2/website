For a single port, it would seem like a relatively easy job to fabricate a
SP manifold to accommodate the 34 carburator.  I hate to see a single port
motor stuck with a dual-port manifold and the accompanying vacuum leaks at
the boots.

Even the dual-port manifold center section is nothing but piping.  No
flow-enhancing shapes from carb to horizontal pipe there!
