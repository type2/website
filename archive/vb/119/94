	Make sure your axle nut is tight. If it is loose it will eat
your drum been there done that. That is what it sounds like to me almost
like grinding your teeth (High Creeking Sound)when you are doing 1 or 2
miles an hour.

Subject: [VB] Creaking sound from drivers rear suspension.

Upon suspension articulation, such as turning and acedning a steep hill
at a stolight, the driver side of my bus creaks some, like the torsion
arm/bar is flexing audibly almost. No noises from tunring noramlly, so I
doubt the trans (also is new) is suspect. Is this the norm, or what
should I check first off? Bus is due to get rear nuts checked, spring
plate bolts checked fine yesterday, and I must tighten my lower shock
bolts some.
