The single relief 1500 had the option to use the type three slotted piston
when it was found that it added a little extra cooling allowing oil to
bypass to the cooler sooner. Not recommended on dual relief 1600 at all.

Why do some oil pressure relief valve pistons have a groove around the top
of
them and others don't? What is the function of this?
