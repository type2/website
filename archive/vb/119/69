  I'd jack it up and swap some real 14 inch wheels on it and take those dumb
looking radars off and put them on my wifes bug where they belong!!

Maybe a Friday topic but what the hell...

Ok, since the tipper will be some hacked up bastard bus beings that I'm
dropping a BIG displacement 1600 cc motor in it (ok, it will look like the
og 1500 but I'll have the benefit of sooo much more power with those bigger
pistons)... I have been pondering the strange idea of running an original
set of empi raders on it for the classic.  I know there are a bunch of
kustoms there and I just wanted to fit in.... and gee, maybe the dkp club
would allow me to cruise with them (?)  Oh, and don't worry, I won't stop by
Greg 'slamomatic' Banfill's shop on the way down so it won't be a *radical
kustom*...

So the question to the group is:

If I did do this and you saw me and the tipper at either the octo or classic
shows would you

a.)  smile
b.)  smile and by me a beer
c.)  think I was a weirdo and keep your distance
d.)  smack me
e.)   other.
