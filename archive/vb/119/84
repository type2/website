If you have a 67 then you have a dual circuit. Save yourself the grief and
buy the adapter kit and a 72-79 MC which will bolt right on and accept your
67 reservoir.

My mechanic says that my master cyclinder is what almost caused me to crash 
the other day. He says he can fix it for 141.00.  Is this right? From every 
magazine i've looked in , the 67 only master cyclinder is at least 200 
dollars. how can he do this? i must be missing something.
