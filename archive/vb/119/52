Another place I like to mount and oil temp or Berg sender is if using a
universal case with a T3 blockoff plate.  Just drill and tap a 1/8 NPT
into the plate and mount the sender there.  This keeps it out of the way
and still checks the sump temps.  Some people also believe in looking only
at the oil after it is cooled before it goes to the bearings but i've
never tried this.
