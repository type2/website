about a couple things.  Back in my 914 days the hot upgrade was to go
from the 914 MC to an early 911 MC.  Identical except the bore of the 911
MC was larger.  I think it was a change from 17mm to 19mm, 19mm to 21mm,
or something like that.  Does anyone know what the bore size is on the
single vs. dual MC's?  If the bore size is smaller (I doubt it) it may
not be the "upgrade" it is touted to be.  Has anyone tried the 914 or
early 911 MC in a bus?

On master cylinders, changing to a larger bore size would increase the
force needed to achieve any given level of braking.  Pressure equals fore
divided by area, so if you increase the bore size (and piston area) you
will reduce the system pressure for a given force.

I think that switching to a dual circuit master cylinder is a great idea,
and you don't have to go all that far from stock to achieve it.  All the
lines are there.  You just have to be careful to select a master cylinder
that is compatible with drum front brakes if that is what you have.
