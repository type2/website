Subject: Re: [VB] hazetguy's strange engine trouble

You might me thinking of how a FI engine works. On a FI engine, there are
only 2 fuel injection cycles. Cylinders 2 and 4 recieve fuel at the same
time and then cylinders 1 and 3 receive fuel.

One of the cylinders in each cycle receive fuel at the end of the exaust
stroke instead of the beginning intake stroke as would be expected.
