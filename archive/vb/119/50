Hi Taylor,
Unless you are going to run a 1776 or bigger engine or plan on cruising at 
well over 4,000 RPM the non-stock extractor mufflers are a waste of time and 
money.  Plus if you install one on an engine of 1641cc or lesser size you 
have to enrichen the carb jetting to to keep the engine temp down from 
running too lean!  As far as a better oil temp sender placement we use a 
T-fitting hand machined into a X-fitting to install stock oil pressure idiot 
light sender, oil pressure sender and even the oil temp sender.  As for a 
deep sump they only help avoid oil starvatation when cornering hard in a race 
like the Monte Carlo.  If you want to cool it more make sure all cooling tin 
and seals are in place, increase oil cooler to a type 4 cooler, make sure you 
run a 35mm (Inside measurement) wide cooling fan, a 2:1 lower pulley and a 
Posche generator pulley.  For anymore cooling you would have to redesign the 
cylinders, heads, and then the cooling tin to fit over the increased finning. 
 For that you may just need to step up to a late 356 Porsche engine and 
install it in your bus!
