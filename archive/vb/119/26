Hi Dan,
We wrote an article for the type2 library on this subject.  The 72 and later 
dual circuit MC has the same bore diameter as the 1955-67 MCs.  The only 
change is a longer bore for the front disc brakes which required more CCs of 
brake fluid, which does not affect braking power in drum brakes.
