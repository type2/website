A header and QP will give you about 3-4 more HP, but
I'm not sure it would make a noticeable difference,
unless it was ceramic coated. 
 A 1.5 qt sump doesn't really do much for cooling;
it's real purpose is to add more oil. A sender in the
sump doesn't really provide an accurate reading of
temp, because of it's location. I would suggest
reading the Berg book about cooling, It has some good
info. If you are concerned about operating temps than
I hope that you run a doghouse in your bus (with the
thermostat!), all of your tin is present and check
your rubber grommet's too. They make a difference.
