Subject: measuring springs

I went to my favorite bugshop to see what they had for oil pressure relief valve
springs. The new ones they have, in the bugpack blister packs, had an
uncompressed length of 80mm, same as the one I pulled from my dual relief
engine. I asked them to look in their old used parts in the back, and there they
found a bunch of 70mm uncompressed length ones. Hmm. I got a couple, they were
free today.
I don't think these uncompressed lengths are very useful information, because
the baywindow bentley I have only deals with loaded lengths. '70-'71 spring
should be 1 3/4" at 12.3 to 16.0 pounds of force. '72 and on spring should be 1
9/16" at 15.0 to 19.4 pounds.  Funny that the '63-'67 bentley gives both
unloaded and loaded length for the 1500 single relief spring. I think that must
be because my '63-'67 book is a  "Workshop Manual" and my '68-'79 book is only
an "Official Service Manual". Does someone have a baywindow "workshop manual"
that has uncompressed lengths in it?
Anyway, I guess what I need to do is figure out some way of compressing the
spring to a known length and measuring the force it takes to do so. I don't
think a bathroom scales is going to do the job, maybe the type of scales you use
to weigh the fish you just caught, pulling down on the spring through the
middle. Someone here must have done this before, am I on the right track with
the fish scales?
Bus runs fine, it could just be me that's broke...
