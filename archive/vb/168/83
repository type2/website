Hi Ronnie,

  A friend in need...indeed!  Sorry I'm in Used Jersey, but I can give
advice.  He should find out which stem is broken by checking the valve
gaps.  If he has AAA+, use it now!  If not - then do what he's planning on
doing.

  This will work providing he avoids steep hills or long upgrades. I had a
broken valve spring and pulled both intake and exhaust push rods out and
my 67' went 40 miles, and carefully replaced the valve spring using
mechanics wire and dykes (whew!). But the motor only lasted 10k after that
and the mains siezed, which could have been from this kludgeing.

Best,
joe

Ronnie writ:

   Richard of Rustybus fame is broken down 40 miles outside of Moab about
20 miles from I 70?. He thinks he broke a valve stem and is stranded. He
is on his way to Colorado and needs some help. He is going to try and
disable the broken cylinder and limp the Rustybus into Moab for repairs.
If there is anybody in the area that can help PLEASE CALL ME 928 680 7664.
