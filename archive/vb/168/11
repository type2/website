Hi Paul,
When you install steel in electron alloy often thecorrosion between them with 
cause a press fit of the parts.  Such as the relief valve plugs and oil 
filler bolt.  Rap with hammer (And a punch for the oil filler bolt) three 
times and see if that jars the threads loose for the stock tool.
