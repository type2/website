Subject: RE: Stupid door question ? 

Jim: Where in the heck do you ever get such unbelievable, utterly false,
information?  Then post it to the vintage list? Why? Perhaps you should have
asked me first? For your information the set of doors are from an employee
of a Local VW dealership.



Subject: re: Stupid door question ?


Not saying that I have been there and done that but may I guess that these
doors are gulf blue and white with a 67 door handle? =) How many times have
you
attended a swap and spotted all of your old parts? hahahahaha
I know of some morons who had a Saturday afternoon "cuttin' party" on a bus
that was very do-able by today's standards based solely on lack of a title,
lack of space, lack of interest and the fleeting desire to clean up the
property. I ~ heard tell that one of these morons has photos in my~ I mean,
his~ closet.
Me thinks that these doors were given away or donated to someone who usually
has good tequilla and a big yard. I dunno, I am too mired in poopy baby
diapers
and readjusting hormones to remember...
Good luck with the doors.
