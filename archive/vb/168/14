Hi, Matt!

You might recall me posting about this product last spring. It converts a
normal bus' back seat to a part-time bed. (Stealth Camper!) I have been very
anxious to get one for my '67 Deluxe, so I'm envious of you! The
manufacturer told me they must make them in batches no smaller than 30 units
to be cost-effective, and by relaying this info on to the list, I had about
a half-dozen others tell me that they too would request one. Guess that
wan't enough. One listee replied that the apparatus caused his seat frames
to crack, but when I asked for details I got no reply. I'm still anxious to
get one of these...

Good to hear from you agian Matt, I was the one parked next to you with the
'76 yellow westy pulling a Scamp trailer.  Next summer, I hope to have
either a '63 Turkis hard top deluxe or a '64 Double Cab doing the pulling
honors.  Of course which either bus I use, it will have an upright 2 liter
for the power plant.  Out here in the Midwest as you know, the closest
campouts are at least 6-8 hours away and having the extra pulling power
makes for a much shorter trip.

Anyway, what you have is a REAL Z bed.  Most people mislable the Westy
folding bed as a Z bed, which is not correct.  Here is the site for your
bed:

Hope to see you again at a campout.  I'll be heading up to the VW Fest in
Herman about an hour west of St. Louis in a couple weeks, maybe I'll see you
there?
