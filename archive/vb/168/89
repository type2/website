Hi Jason,
The plastic disc helps, but is not paramount to the clutch.  Having the TO 
bearing centered side to side in relation to the tranny input shaft is.  Also 
everytime when we remove the engine we test (By comparing it to a new TO 
bearing.) by hand the TO bearing to make sure it has not worn out.  Also if 
it has been more than 20,000 miles since we last replaced the TO bearing or 
removed the engine we remove the TO bearing if it tested good and remove the 
forward dust seal on it to apply some new grease into the TO bearing.  Lastly 
do not sit at the stop light with the clutch pedal pressed down for minutes 
at a time.  Instead if you are third or more back in line put the tranny in 
nuetral and let off the clutch pedal.  If you are closer to the front of the 
line be more aware of the lights/opposing traffic and before it changes push 
the clutch pedal down and shift into gear.
