.... Sorry I am 4-5 hours away from Moab in Salt Lake City.  If there's
anything I can do for Richard from SLC, have him call (-at-) 801-599-5798-cell or
521-3335 days.

We've got to stop having bus folks break down in Utah.  We've already got a
strange reputation here anyway & being part of the "Bermuda Triangle" is not
helping!
