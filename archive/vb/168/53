Subject: idiot light weirdness

Hey All,

Finally recovered from my generator pulling my fan out of the fan shroud!  
Put in some time in the last 2 days and FINALLY fixed my rear axl seal leak! 
  It was only the 4th attempt;)!  Anyway, all my electricals seem fine (or 
how they were) and now both my gen/oil light come on and sometimes stay for 
a long time!  This is scary!  I drove last nite 70 miles jamming the radio 
and all lights and have plenty of juice.  Kept stopping just to make sure 
she was cool, dip stick never got hot!  Any ideas?  Matt?  Anyway some back 
ground, have a  blue wire that is ALWAYS hot not hooked up out of turn 
signal stalk, brights click but never come on!  When I hit my signal the oil 
idiot light blinks w/ my signal arrows.

Thanks for any help!

Glad I am no longer leaking sta-lube!
