Personally, I like the $.79 clear fuel filter.

Just a thought if you can't clean the tank right away.

people really hate easy cheap solutions, but here's one:

Take a magnet and a scrap of old T shirt and sew it into a bag.  Take a wire

clothes hangar and unbend it- bend one end into a loop through the bag o 
magnet.  stick down gas filler- betrer make sure the magnet fits!  make
crook 
in end of wire so it doesn't slip down the tank.  okay- gas cap only fits 
with one ear.  Take out each time you fill with gas, ..let dry while
filling, 
knock rust off bag, and reinsert in tank until it keeps coming out clean.  
Instantly solved hesitation issue, and II didn't have to change the fuel 
filter so often.

 First time posting on the VB list, hope you don't mind but I actually have
a 
 question for my Thing that I just bought....but I figured some of you would

 have dealt with a rusty tank in your splitties.
 
 It's not running very well at all, lots of hesitation and inconsitancys 
 while giving it gas, replaced fuel filter and saw rust was in it, so must
be 
 coming from the tank right?
 
 Is there any tricks or checmicals that you can use to get rid of the rust, 
 or should i just spurge and get a new tank.
 
 Thanks in advance for any input.
