Subject: Who Knows Tim Supriano?

list:

does anyone know tim supriano in newark/san jose, california??  he owes me a lot of money, was supposed to send it to me 2 weeks ago, and at this point isn't returning my phone calls or emails.  he basically seems to be dodging me.  

long story short, he sold me an *NOS* large tent, i received it and it was very used with numerous holes, snaps missing, large stains and a large rip in it. i told him it wasn't at all what he described, gave it back and now he has the tent and my money.

i met him, seemed like an honest person.  i noticed he is selling a ton of parts on everett's site, maybe trying to get MY money together for me, but it would sure be nice if he would let me know that.

any help would be very appreciated.
