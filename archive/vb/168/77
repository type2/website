========================
you will have to pry or pull the pump out.  do not mush anything betwen case 
and pump, or it will leak in future.   There are a couple places the pump 
stills out you can  pry on- try that.  The cheap oil pullers sometimes work, 
but I bent one.    good luck.

  We only use WIX filters since having swelled several and 
even blew up one Fram filter during weather 50F and less.  Plus WIX filters 
seem to be much better quality filter wise.

I blew a filter out on my 65 westy with a filter pump using 30wt oil.  It was 
freezing (ie below 32F), and I hadn't started the bus in a few days.   SO I 
got the relief pumps after that and hadn't blown one since.  On the other 
hand, my bugster has a filter (full flowed) and never blew a filter in years, 
even in winter driving (used Fram).   I  never put a pressure guage on 
bugster, but seems like the pressure is higher in the westy's motor.  It has 
hella pressure.
