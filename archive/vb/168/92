I used brown pare bag, made templates to fit into every hole I could stuff
something in, and cut out pieces of 3/8" blue Styrofoam and glued in place
with H-2 contact cement. It deadens the rattles of the tin and adds a little
insulation. Plus, it's completely waterproof.

Hi Sue,
We paint the insides of our doors with roofing tar, just make sure the door 
is completely clean and dry before doing this.  As for insulation best to
use 
the tar paper sound insulation (Glued in place with roofing tar from the 
factory!!) stuff scavanged out of late model bugs to help quite the front 
doors.  Any other nontar based insulation is probably at risk of holding 
water and causing rust.  The front doors of all VWs are designed to allow 
water to drip down from the windows and down through the bottom into the 
dogleg and out below the bus.  We have heard that spraying chain saw oil in 
the doglegs and rockers for the salty East coast works wonders.  Which
should 
do even better in wet climates where salt is not used.
