Subject: VWs for Trade

Hey Y'all,
I apologize for the marginal content of this post, but since I know that a lot
of BUS owners also dig other VW's (obligatory bus content;^) I want everyone
to know about these couple of VW's I am offering for trade.  One is a 1985
Cabriolet Convertible and the other is a 1966 Beetle (both located in
Southwestern Ohio), here are the links with all the info
