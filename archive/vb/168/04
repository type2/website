Subject: re: Stupid door question ? 

Not saying that I have been there and done that but may I guess that these
doors are gulf blue and white with a 67 door handle? =) How many times have you
attended a swap and spotted all of your old parts? hahahahaha
I know of some morons who had a Saturday afternoon "cuttin' party" on a bus
that was very do-able by today's standards based solely on lack of a title,
lack of space, lack of interest and the fleeting desire to clean up the
property. I ~ heard tell that one of these morons has photos in my~ I mean,
his~ closet.
Me thinks that these doors were given away or donated to someone who usually
has good tequilla and a big yard. I dunno, I am too mired in poopy baby diapers
and readjusting hormones to remember...
Good luck with the doors.
