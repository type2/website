Subject: FW: [VB] Re: engine miss at high rpm

	I had this same problem when the engine would warm up. I
associated it to the points or a bad connection with one of the spark
plug wires arcing. When I cleaned the cap, filed the points, and checked
all the plug wires the problem was gone.

Hi Volks,
Could be the distributor drive and the gear on the bottom of the
distributor 
are just barely touching due to incorrect shimming of the distributor
drive 
gear.  When accelerating and higher RPMs this connection will slip.
Also it 
could be your air correction jets are way too big allowing too lean of 
mixture at higher RPMs.
