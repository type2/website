Volks,

The flexible/adjustable pipes between the heater box and the central heat tube
in a bus is giving me grief.  When I bought My Sweet Bus, the cloth covered
flexible tube was pretty much shot . . . the insulation anyway.  So while down
in So Cal I bought the plastic screw/adjustable ones for her.  Are these going
to work?
