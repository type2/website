That's my vote, the radiator shop. Not worth my time to do something someone
else can do better.

Don't waste your time with the tank.
Remove it and take it to a radiator shop, they'll clean it and treat it
with rust inhibitor and return it unless you have then do the R&R and in
that case you've got a turn key solution.
