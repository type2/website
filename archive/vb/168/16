Subject: Mid West VW swap meet 

The MO-KAN FALL SWAP MEET is scheduled for Saturday, October 5th at Vee
Village from 8am to 2pm.  Our swap meet will be held in conjunction with Vee
Village's Open House at their new location, 16th & Oak (just across the
street and up one block from the old location).  $20 per space.  Food and
refreshments will be provided by Vee Village, and rumor has it there will be
parts from the famed old V.V. basement, that haven't seen the light of day
for years.  So if you are looking for that just right part, or need to turn
some unneeded parts into cash, this is a not-miss event.
