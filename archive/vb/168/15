Reminds me of the time a Pollack saw an ad in the old Dallas Times Herald 
advertising "Carribean cruise .... 30 ports of call ....$100." The Pollack 
couldn't wait. He breaks his neck getting down to the Port of Houston 
address. 

Sure enough, the Pollack boards a Galley ship, and they row on 30 ports of 
call. The 
ship even has a drummer beating the  candence ...BOOM! ! BOOM! BOOM! ,,, 
After the thirty ports of call, as they are rowing back into the Port of 
Houston,  the Pollack
turns around to the ole boy behind him and asks, "Is ti customary to tip the 
drummer?"
 
The ole boy behind him was an Aggie, who replied, "I dunno ... we didn't last 
year."
