VB] Photo of Green SC in Jackson Hole


> I just got some photos of some shots I took in Jackson Hole around the
first week in August.  I've got a nice shot of a green SC with a roof rack,
white awning over the bed and American flag design on the emblem.  If it's
yours and you want a copy of the photo, pmail me.
