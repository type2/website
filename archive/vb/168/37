Subject: re:shift rod coupler

i just took mine apart...luckily it was not stuck. but yes the fron shift
rod tube is basicaly a hollow tube that slides over the rear shift rod.

i believe you need to take the set screw out completely to remove the shift
rod.

this is for a '65 not sure how many years this applies to.
