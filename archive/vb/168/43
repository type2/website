Subject: RE: Berg shifters

So how much are Berg shifters in the US?  Especially the locking ones?  Did
a quick search on the net and couldn't find a supplier.  
I hopefully have another trip out to the US soon and so might get one if its
price is much less over here than the UK as most parts seem to be!
