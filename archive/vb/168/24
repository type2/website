I feel for ya. In all the years I have had VW's, I have only had one with
factory wiring. I believe there is something in the owners manual that
requires you to cut an splice devices into obscure places in your harness.
If you sell the vehicle, the next owner is compelled to repair the splices
from your removed equipment and place them back in what he/she believes is
pretty close to being right. If a number of people owned the vehicle before
you, the harness might closer resemble something from the phone company or
Medusas' hairdo.

Hi Rick,
Either it is wired incorrectly, and/or the switch needs rebuilding, and/or 
was rebuilt and insides aligned improperly.
