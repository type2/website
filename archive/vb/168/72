Subject: Gear Ratio Formula

Does anyone have a formula to calculate the unknowns
by turning the crankshaft and counting turns of the road wheel ?
I know this can get complicated fast, and there is a considerable
possibility of error, but I am currently searching the archives and haven't
found the answer. It would be ideal to have a chart.
I am currently attempting to diagnose an April  66 bus which has
a small nut rear mounted, and comparing to a March 63 small nut rear, the
turns of the road wheel don't match in 3rd and 4th gear
( reverse, 1st and 2nd do ).  Insofar as the 66 has the "wrong " transaxle,
I would like to solve this puzzle without disassembly.
