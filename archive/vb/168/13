Hi Kevin,
Yup!!  Up to 1960 there was a wire bracket bolted to the front left side of 
the tranny to prevent this.  1961 and later there was a boden like tube for 
the accelerator cable.  We bought some of these tubes for later bug (111 721 
551 is the listed bus manual part for this, and mentions needing to shorten 
it to 670mm, but in our experience it should be 760mm instead.) and had to 
shorten them about 1/4" after carefully slipping off one crimped on end and 
relacing it after the shortening.   Eric&Barb
