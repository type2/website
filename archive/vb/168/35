I can't imagine how it would stress the tranny.  The principle is to change 
the leverage of the shifter thus getting a shorter throw in the handle.  The 
linkage moves the same amount it did with the original shifter.  It surely 
makes a big difference to the driver though.  My Berg gives crisp, short, 
positive shifts.  I can sit with my back on the seat and shift. No more seat 
calesthentics on the oar to change gears.
