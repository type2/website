Easy:  Dont use the third bolt. :)

Or...

find the right-length bolt to come in from the transaxle side.  Find a
case with the pressed in nut.  Press the nut into your case.  Fight your
way around the clutch lever and install the bolt. :)

If you cant find a pressed in nut....good luck fitting a nut and wrench
between the cooler and the case....it can probably be done....
