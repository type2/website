Subject: RE: [VB] Moab, Utah, BUS HELP/update

    After not being able to get help after limping back to Moab, Richard has
decided to push on to Grand Junction, Co. There he will go to body and paint
man extraordinaire John Jones' shop for help. He's going to try and drive
there (100 miles) on 3 cylinders. I have contacted John and gave Richard all
his contact info. John should have all parts to repair Richards bus sitting
there when he arrives.

Ronnie
ps  Mike Hanson PLEASE P-mail me for Richard

   Richard of Rustybus fame is broken down 40 miles outside of Moab about 20
miles from I 70?. He thinks he broke a valve stem and is stranded. He is on
his way to Colorado and needs some help. He is going to try and disable the
broken cylinder and limp the Rustybus into Moab for repairs. If there is
anybody in the area that can help PLEASE CALL ME 928  680 7664.
