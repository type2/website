Subject: Re: [VB] Shift rod coupler off! Hurray! Shiftrod staying put -

If the coupler is off, I'd think the set screw would be off.   it threaded 
onto the couple only.  it has a pointy end that goes into a dint in the rod.  
the hollow rod has a hole that centers over the dint- thats how you line them 
up.     So the rods are rusted together.....hmmm

douse liberally with liquid wrench like holy water every day and tapping and 
it'll come off in a week  is one concept.  (This works well for taking pop 
out windows off- douse/ insert screw driver and tap end a few times. repeat 
the next day.  turn the screwdriver to undo screws in a week.)

I use a torch to heat the connection up (be careful of what is behind the 
connection) and squirt it with a squirty drink bottle of water when hot to 
shock cool contract it and knock rust loose.

the two vise grips and twist deal is good, but be careful with the forward 
rod as it is hollow and you don't want to squash it.    It's getting harder 
to find good forward shift rods.

 However, the front shift rod is not budging loose from the rear shift 
 rod.
 
 So, here I am again asking for advice.
 
 Do I have to do more drilling to take the set screw out? Is the front 
 shift rod a hollow tube, and the middle shift rod slide into the middle? 
 I have been spraying this area with lubricant, PBBlaster, Liquid Wrench, 
 etc. I tried the method of trying to twist the front shift rod free 
 while holding the other rod with a wrench, but that isn't getting me 
 very far.
