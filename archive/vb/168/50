For tales of a VW-based homebuilt "schwimmerwagen", go to:

http://www.inertia.org/acvwjyro/acvwjy/index.htm

and scroll down to the "Schwendlemeyer Schwimmerwagen" paragraph.  I suggest starting with the "Cuyahoga River" episode.

=================================

>>
I will be leaving in a few minutes to go watch the Discovery channel
film an episode of Monster Garage here in Lake Havasu. They have converted a bus to float and drive like a boat (a school bus not one of beloved VW
buses).  I am going to try and get one of my buses in some backround shots, we'll see what happens.
