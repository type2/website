Hi Kevin,
Both jobs can be done with a pair of slot tip screwdrivers, but there is a 
good chance of slipping and scratching the engine case which will cause 
future oil leaks!  Having both removal tools is alot easier, less time and 
less dangerous.

NO!

Filters have differant thread mounts from auto to auto.  You will have to 
measure the approximate length of filter you can use in the space given.  
Then take the pump cover to a FLAPS and check thread fit.  Then make sure to 
use ONLY filters with internal relief valve (Spring visable just inside 
outlet opening.).  We only use WIX filters since having swelled several and 
even blew up one Fram filter during weather 50F and less.  Plus WIX filters 
seem to be much better quality filter wise.
