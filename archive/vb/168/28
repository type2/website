Yea"
 thats my vote as well.

 Just be sure the shop & person doing the actual work
knows the value of the tank, had a very bad
experience, when the D--- F--- pounded a corner flat,
drilled & tapped a 3/4" hole to drain out the sealer?

 To late then to explain how you can't easily replace
it with a chevy truck tank.

and the beat go's on.
