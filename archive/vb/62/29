David,
I did this repair on my old '66 with the beam ON. It took a little flexibility, busted knuckles, and a few "colorful" expressions, but all in all it was easy enough.  I used Muirs technique of hammering it upward using a socket just bigger tahn the bushings but just smaller than the opening where they go.  The hardcores will probably say this is not a good idea, but it worked for me!
