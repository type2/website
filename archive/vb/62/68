Subject: Re: [VB] Just how fast does your bus go??

Top speed I have hit so far is "O" ...That is "O" as in Orange not "0" as in
Zero.  Spun the needle around till it was resting just over the "O" in the
VDO.  I guesstimate that to be about 80.  I forget what the RPM's were but
it wasn't too bad...3.44 Ring and Pinion and tall 15" tires.
