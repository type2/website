One problem with speed quotes (other than ego inflation) is that not 
all speedometers are accurate.  For example, I could say that I cruise 
between 75 and 80 in my '71 (Low compression Mexican 1600 and stock 
transmission), but that is only what the speedometer says.  

The reality, as reported by the GPS, is that I really cruise around 
58MPH.

The older my speedo gets, the more optomistic it is.  I figure in 
another five years I'll have a metric speedometer.
