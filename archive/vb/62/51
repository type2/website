But following JP you would be doing at least 68 mph all the way here. Now if
Berry is along plan on 55 mph the whole way.

any effect on your gas mileage.  i think they will.

OK, if JP will let me I'll follow him to Havasu, and when I get there I
believe I'll have a Vodka and Tonic with JP and ruminate on MPG.  Looks
like I'm going to make it to BBB.  I'll be winning a Rancho pro-street
3.88 bus tranny right Ronnie?:)  About lightening the load, I sure hate to
leave behind my spare engine.  I just know I'll throw a rod if I don't
travel with the spare.  No roof rack though.  JP has ALL that stuff on the
top of his bus, seems like I should at least throw in a spare engine and
bottle of vodka.

See you all there.
