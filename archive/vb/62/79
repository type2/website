 Hey, again...
 
 I have a clutch pedal that does not fully return.  Probably going to take
 the bus to the shop tomorrow, but I'd like to have a confident feel as to
 the problem when talking to them.  It's not the pressure plate.  I replaced
 that today.  Likewise I don't think it is the clutch lever spring, as it
 looked OK to me.  Someone told me of a second spring up at the pedal.  Does
 this sound right to you?  Are these springs still available? - Thanks

yes, crawl under bus  and look at the clutch pedal assembly.  At the pivot of 
the pedal should be a functional spring.  If it is broken it wont spring up 
all the way, only as far as the rear spring springs it, so you get a slight 
drag .  You should take the assembly apart and regrease all in there when you 
replace the broken spring.  It is not complecated, a look should show you how 
it works, or a look in teh bentley
