Subject: apb for 2 bolts

Hi all.

I'm in need for 2 10x25mm 'Kamax 8G' bolts.  17mm head.  These secure the
front backing plate to the spindle.

It seems in my bolt pile, I have 6 kamax and 2 rasche bolts of this size.
Ronnie claims that's because Gunter had just stocked the bin with a
different brand of bolt back in '59 when my double cab was coming down the
assembly line.  Could be...

Any help would be appreciated.
