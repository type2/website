Subject: RE: [VB] Clutch Pedal

My 67 tipper has a non-returning clutch pedal also.  I'm planning this next
week to pull it into the garage and go through it.  BTW, does one need to
drop the engine to best replace the return spring?

I recently had this same issue. The rear spring (the only one) wasn't
strong enough to handle the cable, pedal, and the throwout fork. I
replaced it with a fresh spring, and redid all the bushings inside for a
smooth returning pedal. Initally, although the spring felt good, the
pedal would just stay down.
The fresh spring was much stronger.
This style sring is also used to return brake pedal, but it's the only
one in the back for clutching.
