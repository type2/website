My 2 cents:
With a 1600 sp and a 28pict carb I used to do 65 all day on the flat and
could sometimes actually do 70. Calculated rpm at 70 was 3900 rpm. P205-15
radials.

With a 1600dp progressive 2barrel carb, 70 all day on the flat, 75 sometimes
when I wanted and 80 peak. (got scared and slowed down) Same tranee and
tires as above.
