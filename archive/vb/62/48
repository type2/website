OK, if JP will let me I'll follow him to Havasu, and when I get there I
believe I'll have a Vodka and Tonic with JP and ruminate on MPG.  Looks
like I'm going to make it to BBB.  I'll be winning a Rancho pro-street
3.88 bus tranny right Ronnie?:)  About lightening the load, I sure hate to
leave behind my spare engine.  I just know I'll throw a rod if I don't
travel with the spare.  No roof rack though.  JP has ALL that stuff on the
top of his bus, seems like I should at least throw in a spare engine and
bottle of vodka.

See you all there.
