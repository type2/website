   Due to the limited amount of room and the way the hinges face, shimming VW 
doors really is not practical.  Your gonna have to tweak the hinges.  
Normally this should have been done before starting any panel replacement, 
but there is the acception every now and then.  You need a piece of 2 X 4 
about 2 1/2 feet long plus another board to pry off of in the cargo area.  I 
say this, because it the rocker is rusty or missing you need support to pry 
off of.  Set the 2 X 4 on the other board and shut the door as far as 
possible.  With your pry board under the cargo doors left side you can pry 
up.  Do this a little at a time, checking out the doors fit as you go along.  

   Body Shops use this technique, usually charging the customer an hours 
labor.  With practice you can align most doors and hoods in about 10 minutes. 
 Also the heavier the door or hoods the longer the 2 X 4, but for VW stuff 
the 2 1/2 feet board seems to work rather well and is less prone to over 
powering the door.  You want to move things nice and slow. 
                                                                 Peace,
                                                                      FW.
