Subject: Re: Back by popular demand - Alan Schofield repair panels

I'm interested in two of the replacement cargo door bottom framing pieces
(not the outer skin),which Alan shows as part #10 in his early Type 2
diagram and listing. I haven't seen them listed anywhere else. Please let me
know the price and details by direct e-mail.

Given the recent discussion about quality shortcomings in some replacement
sheet metal parts, does anyone have favorable or unfavorable experience with
Alan's pieces?
