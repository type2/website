Subject: RE: [VB] Clutch Pedal

Thanks to all that replied about my pedal.  Turns out, my clutch pedal
itself was slowly seizing, and I never noticed it until it became a problem.
They cleaned the area where the pedal bolts to the body, adjusted the
clutch, and Boy o' Boy, I never had that much pedal! - Thanks again.

I recently had this same issue. The rear spring (the only one) wasn't
strong enough to handle the cable, pedal, and the throwout fork. I
replaced it with a fresh spring, and redid all the bushings inside for a
smooth returning pedal. Initally, although the spring felt good, the
pedal would just stay down.
The fresh spring was much stronger.
This style sring is also used to return brake pedal, but it's the only
one in the back for clutching.
Good luck,
AL

Hey, again...

I have a clutch pedal that does not fully return.  Probably going to
take the bus to the shop tomorrow, but I'd like to have a confident feel
as to the problem when talking to them.  It's not the pressure plate.  I
replaced that today.  Likewise I don't think it is the clutch lever
spring, as it looked OK to me.  Someone told me of a second spring up at
the pedal.  Does this sound right to you?  Are these springs still
available? - Thanks
