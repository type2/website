Subject: swing lever shaft bushing

 I was laying under the truck today (62 SC), trying to see how to remove
the pin holding the swing lever in place. Is it nessesary to drop the
front beam for this, or is there a "cheat" of some way. The flvwps has
the pin & bushings cheap enough, and that 2 1/2 inches of play is gettin
one my nerves. The steering box is tightened to the max, but theres no
play in it, a new one is in order real soon. Already have new tie-rod
ends, drag link, tires, & shocks.
