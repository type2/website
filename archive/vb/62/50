Hey all,
Well this topic is timely for me.  As I was coming back from TX headed to
Roswell my speedo started getting wacky.  Cruising about 70 the thing would
just grab and jump up spiking towards the needle stop.  Remembering that
Ronnie had broken a needle I disconnected it and went on.  Got a cable
thinking that it sure did go bad fast if that was it. It wasn't so now
I guess I should thinking about looking inside.  This only happens at higher
speeds and now I noticed it has a stripping gears kind of sound to it.
Anybody know what I'm likely to be faced with as far as what parts I will
be needing?

Thanks,
John K.
