remember when barry had that 40 horse in his "scientific labmobile" and we caravanned from albuquerque to jerome?  every gas stop he'd be waiting for us only to nitrous off to the next gas stop.

i remember being kind of surprised that jp's fast bus, the brown one with the big engine (1641 with dual carbs), was such a slug but then it was the most loaded down too.

that bus got great mileage even for the two carbs and all the weight.  it must have been the "rainbow power" of that kid i toted up to flag.

sharing the road to and from a campout/show and visiting with good vw folks is what i think our hobby is all about.  that may be too generalized but i'm having some powerful good memories right about now.
