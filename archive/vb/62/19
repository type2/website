Subject: $5400 for a  rolled `60 westy

Hey did anybody see the `60 hatch top westy sell
sunday on eBay? 
<http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/aw-cgi/ebayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=599765514&r=0&t=0>

Final bid was over $5400!  

The darn thing is the bus was rolled or flipped on its
side-roof!  Check out the pics on the auction they
look ok.  But owner mentions roof damage I asked for
photos...and WOW that babby was flipped or rolled
hard! 

Cant believe that much for some nice westy stuff and a
wasted bus body.  I have pics of the damage the guy
emailed me. I will post em on Vintagebus.com check em
out.  

Who bought this thing?  I hope he has an extra body!

Ouch!
