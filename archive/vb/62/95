Bingo; I never thought about that!!!
When I rebuilt the engine I bought a new carb at the FLAPS (it was under
$100 and it made sense to replace it as opposed to trying my patience on
rebuilding the one that was there).  The carb would not fit unless I put
that "strange plate" back in; it wouldnt get around the fuel pump as I
recall.  Somebody later told me it was some sort of govenor.

I had forgotten about that until just now.

Do you still have the governor under the carb? That was a stock item in
'67 I think. Maybe that's why you can't go any faster than 57 mph.
