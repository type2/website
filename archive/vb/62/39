Hi Chuck,
Clara is correct you will just need to go through the complete circuit the 
electricity takes, cleaning, tightening and soldering.  Using a volt/ohm 
meter to check for voltage drops along the way really helps to show one where 
the trouble is.  Start with the voltage the battery is putting out and work 
up to the dash and back to the soliniod.  Soldering the multiple copper clips 
together on either side of each fuse in the fuse box is a big help.  Also 
check out the solder and repair article for the head light switch in the 
type2 library.  Both of these last two proceedures are a must for all VW 
owners and must be done with the battery disconnected!
