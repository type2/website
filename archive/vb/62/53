Don't forget, any listee coming by my fire pit is
welcome to a V&T.  And you've got to help me burn all
my firewood, so I have room in my trailer for my spare
engine Jon Furst (hazetguy(-at-)earthlink.net) is returning
to me.

I agree.  (Not about the Vodka.)  I'm afraid if I
don't take my spare engine on to California with me
when I get it back from Jon that I'll throw a rod. 
BBBV (or was it IV?) wasn't good to me engine-wise. 
(Dropped #3 exhaust valve head into combustion chamber
- not pretty)  Barry has offered to take it straight
back to Albuquerque, but my trailer should be empty
anyway, right?  AND I get lousy gas mileage with all
that stuff on my rack and the speeds I drive!
