when i did this on a 30p1, total cost was $75.
the main danger is: if the carb is crapped out, rebushing won't fix
anything but the throttle shaft leak; mine ended up being a $75
paperweight, as the idle circuit was bad.

 Is it worth it to do this to the Brosol carb,

ronnie was going to investigate the elec top on the manual 30p1, but i
don't think he's had the time.
main concern is drillings on top of carb that may or may not be needed, if
the manual carb has a power jet or not, etc.
i ran a frankenstein carb for a bit - solex non-powerjet bottom and a
brasol WITH powerjet top... ran ok, obviously the powerjet didn't work, but
never ran RIGHT.
(btw, carbs USED to be 'tuned' at the factory as a top/bottom unit...
shaving metal off one or the other to achieve flat mating/best airflow,
etc, so in theory, switching tops will render the carb less than effecient.
have no idea if they still do this).

i bought  a rebuilt solex30p1 thru jerry jess, still working on it... i
suspect the idle circuit on this one is crapped out, too (idles at 450 when
cold, 1300 when hot :(  ), so i would LOVE it if we could cobble together
NEW 30p1s w/ elec chokes.

vendors, start yer engines!
