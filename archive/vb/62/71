Subject: Re: [VB] Just how fast does your bus go??

rich,

you should be able to go about 60 mph if your bus is 
stock. i can cruise at 65 (-at-) 3000 rpm but i can take it 
to 80 easily. see i have a 67' big nut tranny with a 
3:88 ring a pinion and a 82 fourth gear. I have 
205/65/15's and a stock 1600 dp motor. Its nothing high 
tech i just have the 3:88 in my tranny. its great on the 
staightaways but i drop down to 47-50 mph on steep hills.
if your interested in upgrading your tranny i recommend 
I.T.S transmission in el cajon ,ca. Thats where i bought 
mine, and i love it.
