Subject: Fort Wayne :( :( :( :(

Hey Listees!
    Bart Daugherty here and I am gonna be stuck here in Fort Wayne, IN for 
awhile.  Staying at a corp. apt. for now, but have to find a house this 
week.  My sundial is being stored in Fresno till the salt is gone or I may 
just leave it there and fly out for the shows.  Any VW ppl here in Fort 
Wayne????  I have  seen a few beetles and a couple of rusted out bays, no 
splits though :(  Well have fun in Havasu, gonna be in Nashville that 
weekend.  My wife wanted me to sell my bus?  You believe that?  Anyway after 
a year or so I think I can make it to the west coast, this is one of those 
career building moves.  Gonna miss all of you.

Bart
