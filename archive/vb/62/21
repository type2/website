Subject: RE: [VB] swing lever shaft bushing

I had a blow out on the interstate traveling about 60 mph.  After I had it
towed to replace the tire the steering has become very tight.  The last time
I had this symptom, it turned out the swing lever pin/bushings had to be
replaced.  Can a blow out create enough torque to bend the swing lever pin?
All the tie rods look straight nad the ends look ok.  Any help you could be
would be appreciated.

Go to http://vintagebus.com/howto/ for a detailed procedure on
replacing this bushing, and some other how-to's.

You don't need to drop the beam.

Tightening the steering box to fix slop is roughly equivalent to voiding 
your bladder the direction of a brisk breeze.
