Subject: Re: [VB] Just how fast does your bus go??    

my 61 15 window I usually drive it about 60, but I accidently took it up to 
70 once -that was before I put the small tires on front, so it had 205 75 15s 
all around - 1600sp, 4.37r/p, 1.26 rg.   had a 59 truck with little nut 
tranny and 40hp motor, lots of zip, but I tried to keep it to 52mph, or it 
would whine -  I could take it up to 60mph, but it really was very  unhappy 
there.  Could pull hills fully loaded though.  There is a difference between 
what the bus can be pushed to go, and where the sweet spot is.  I don't mind 
being passed on the freeway, it's so stylee to drive an old bus.

Is your speedo accurate?  When you go max speed is it whining with excessive 
rpms or just not enough oomph.   If the latter maybe your motor is getting 
tired (compression check?)   But maybe not.  You say the bus is stock? How do 
you know what the gearing is, unless you have complete records since bus was 
new?  The tranny that came to me in my 65 westy had a bug 4th gear in it- 
that does drop top speed.

 I was going to save this question for Friday, but all these discussions
 concerning experiments and Trannys have me wondering about my bus.  Just how
 fast does your bus go??
 
 Everybody is talking about cruising down the road at 65 and 70 MPH; my bus
 only goes 55-57 MPH (NOT 58+, unless there is a good tailwind and/or I am
 going downhill).  I thought I was doing good, but I feel a bad case of
 'speed envy' coming on <vbg>.
 
 My '67 std is stock everything with a 1600SP engine.  I am running P225R-15
 tires.  Seriously, I was courious if it is because everybody has DP engines
 and higher performance trannys, or is it something I need to go out and
 check on (performance-wise).  BTW it appears to be running fine.
