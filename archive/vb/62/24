i was curious - if one electrically insulated the unit from the chassis,
could you run a separate 6v battery hooked up just to the heater? sure,
you'd have to take it out and charge it now and again, but big whoop.
i have a 6v bug heater that i keep looking at putting in the s/c... plenty
of room for extra battery!
