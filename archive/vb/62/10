Subject: middle seat weight

Just wondering if anyone has shipped a bus middle seat (full width 1965)
lately and knows approximately what one weighs? I'm trying to figure out how
to get one from Toronto, Canada to Vancouver, Canada. Anyone coming out this
way? We would be happy to pay someone for their trouble.
Thanks & Regards
