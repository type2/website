Subject: Re: [VB] Just how fast does your bus go??

I have reached over 100 mph so far.  61 crew cab, 911 2.0 motor and 901
5-speed trans.  I recently converted a 120km speedo to read mph, so I
will see if that is all it will do.

Actually, the noise is rather unbearable above 90mph.  A few years ago,
the ex and my kids drove from LA to San Francisco at 85mph the entire
way.  That is the perfect speed!  The fast lane all the way!

I wouldn't have tried anything over 70 without the updated brakes!  I
run 911 fronts and 914 rears.
