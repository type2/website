Hi Mike,
If you are not going for a full out resto, but for daily driving you should
consider installing a 1965ish-67 front beam for 20% bigger brakes and easier
to find brake/suspension parts.  As far as the wheel bearing you might have
to grind it off.  Since it could have been welded to the spindle due to bad
maintance.  Beware of cheap brake parts of unknown origin.  Made in India
wheel cylinders have been known to be complete junk!   Eric&Barb
