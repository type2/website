-I forgot one of the cool donations we got and that was a Remanufactured
steering wheel from Chris Dreike, The Steering Wheel Man, sorry I forgot,
but I'm sure they are a few more. Great prizes, great event, a lot of buses
and a heck of a lot of fun. Weather report for the BBB VI weekend in
unseasonable warm weather.
