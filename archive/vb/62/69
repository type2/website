You may have answered your question with your last statement. Your 67 bus is NOT
stock with 225 15's on it. Stock is 185 14.
Your speedo is calibrated for 14" tires. 63 and back buses with 15" wheels have
a different ratio speedo. I believe you are going a lot faster then what your
speedo indicates.
