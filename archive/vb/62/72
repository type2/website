I accidently hit 83.3 mph (according to my new GPS) on
the way to LA for Thanksgiving in my '61 Flipseat
Westy.  That was (for those who know me) without
anything on my top racks except a little firewood to
keep the front one from whistling, but I was hauling
my singlewheel trailer (empty).

It's got a 3.88 big nut w/ a balanced 1776, dual baby
Webers, 205 15s, and I probably am winding it way out.
Gotta put a tach on it someday.  That's why I want to
carry my spare engine going to LA after BBB.  Never
can tell...
