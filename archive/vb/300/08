Hey all--

I just ran into a super deal on some permanent mount Osram "genuine Made
In Deutschland Halogen map lights--
 I am mounting two of them up front  on the end caps of the pop top
extension channels behind my head as well as the passenger side--the
mounting possibilities are endless-----
They are real attractive and bright accessory lamps--
I only have a few left at #21.99--

Scroll down and check them out at the "Van Stuff" web page below--

These would make a real nice Xmas gift for your Vanasweetheart or
Vanaguy--Bus Guy or Gal--

Happy Holidays---
