Splitnosers,

  After having just the 61' SL & 67' Camper for transportation for over a
yr., and having already two snows here in used jersey, I felt a calling
for some other transportation. I need something that I can take to places
without worrying about my cars getting vandelized, stolen or stripped of
parts.  I need something that I can go to places when all the cars are
dusted with dried salt and dirt.
 
  Therefore, I bought a 92 VW Fox this morning. It is a red two door and
seems to be the perfect $200 car -- Anybody have a VW Fox before? It kinda
is like my departed 92 Geo Metro, and I can get antique auto insurance
again, so my insurance coverage will go up and the cost of insurance will
go down!

  I have used the money saved by not having another car, and used the time
to further zero time the type II's, both are getting closer towards how
I'd like them to be - 100% reliable and safe.  It would be misleading to
call the SL and Camper daily drivers since I drive as little as possible
and like having the work, bank, post office, bar, grocery store, and
coffee houses within walking distance, and having the train station to NYC
and Philly also within walking distance.  I will be more mobile now.

Best,
joe
