Subject: re: Speedometer chrome beauty ring

    Does anybody know if there is a vendor out there that is selling the
bus speedometer beauty rings? Mine is pretty shot and now that I have
rebuilt the speedometer I am need of a  beauty ring that goes on the
dash not on the speedometer itself. Will any of the bug dash rings
work???



TIA
