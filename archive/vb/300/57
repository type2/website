Subject: front shift coupler & screw?

--Rob, Clara, Matt and all,

I found the coupler by asking over the phone at the Busboys for 14.11, screws for 1.00.  I love the busboys!  Further more, everything they have is 15% off till the end of the year. Everything.

Rob, Yes I have replaced all bushings, hangers, grommets, clips, nuts, grease and whachizmos on the whole system except this. 

Thanks,

Billy

Since you have a 65 you will have the late coupler. I just went through this on my bus.  I ended up getting a coupler and screw from wolfsburg west a bit expensive $20 for coupler $2.50 for screw.
