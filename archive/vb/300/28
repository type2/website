Subject: front shift coupler & screw?

Hey everyone,

according to:

http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part/359.png

The front shift coupler is #14:
p/n 211 711 169A

It's set screw is #18:
p/n 111 711 189

During my transmission replacement, I discovered my screw was long gone and the rods held together by rust.

My coupler is highly rusted, I want a new one and need the screw either way. I've got an M8 sawed off bolt in there now. The coupler is listed at BusDepot, but not in stock according to phone-guy.

There is a screw listed on the site as 443 711 189A,
Phone-guy says not in stock and doesn't know if it's for the front or the rear coupler.

I've looked for these parts at most of the usual suspects. Can anyone give me some more leads?

I'd sure like to have an easy shift into 3rd on this new tranny!

Billy
