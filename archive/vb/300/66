Subject: Bad 9-Prong? Now 8-Prong!?

I've put two images in the Samba gallery of pictures I took today of my 
black box.  Can someone help confirm for me that the #30 prong has busted 
off sometime before leaving me with an 8-prong box and no working hazard 
lights on the outside?  Also looking for ideas on the best way to 
replace...will the Matt Roberds Relays work fine or should I try to locate 
another 9-er?
