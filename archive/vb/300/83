Subject: Re: Rheostat values and calculations

Thanks Matt for the clarification.  Like I said, it's been a LOOOONG
time since 9th grade electricity classes but it seems I got pretty
close.  I intentionally tried to be on the conservative side for the
suggested values because in a perfect world it'd probably work but since
we drive our 30+ year old buses in an imperfect world it's probably
better to be conservative and allow some space for, as you mentioned,
the vagarities of the electrical system when exposed to real world
conditions.
