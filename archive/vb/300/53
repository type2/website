Subject: sweeper motor and head question

putting together my  1600cc 'sweeper motor' - all the parts swept off 
the floor and made into an engine :)  - and had some questions.
first, i had to yank the head studs that were in it; these were 
purchased from  a list vendor, and were 'tha sh*t' ones that would 
NOT snap at proper torques. well, they might not break, but they were 
5mm too long! even fully cranked into the inserts, they stuck way the 
hell out of the head  and interfered with the rocker shaft. were 
untapered and just not deutsch-looking, to boot. dug around in the 
pathetic remains of my stash and found some old studs... put em in... 
ah, perfecto. nothing like good german steel and machining.  anyone 
else experience this?

second, i noticed that of the 4 heads in my box, two are old 1500 
heads, one is good ol' 311101373a, but the 4th is a 040101373... 
which comes up as a 1600 DP head in my googling, but it is quite 
clearly a SINGLE port head. vw/audi parts symbols. unless someone 
tells me it has oddball valves, i won't worry about it.

poked around for some cylinder shims; found some that gave me deck 
total of .090 and a CR of 7.2:1. tad higher than my goal, but close 
enough. over the holidays i'm going to assemble the tinwork and see 
if it cranks over; i know the dizzy drive has some damage, and i've 
no idea on the valves and seats, but it really only has to run around 
town a few weeks while i pull the aluminum crapcase for retorquing 
and de-voodooing.
