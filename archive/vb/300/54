Subject: Rheostat vs Voltage Drop?

All this talk about rheostats, but... havent herd
anything about VD resistors... last month I scored a
bugpack VD, 12 to 6v, pn 3598... anyone ever use one
of these? the heat sinks dont look like theyed do to
much tho.... real shallow... just to make sure, gonna
build a larger HS from scrap aluminum to mount it to.
not really worried bout having multi-speed wipers,
just tired of the hyper-drive ones...
