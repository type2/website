Calling all Splittie Riviera Owners!

http://autos.groups.yahoo.com/group/rivieraregistry/

The Riviera Registry is now open for business.  Please come and join our 
list if you own an early Riviera camper.  I'm in the process of setting up 
the site.  My main goal with this is to collect as much information as I 
can regarding the early Rivieras and make that available to anyone who owns 
one or someday purchases one.  And yes, the plan is to someday move away 
from just the list and database and get into a complete, professionally 
done website.
