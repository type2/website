I've tried using a hand vacuum pump, but it seemed like it was sucking
in extra air someplace (around the bleeder screw threads?)  It was hard
to tell when I was done as there were always tiny bubbles in the tubing.
Bob Hoover says that these will actually suck in air around the wheel
cylinder seals.  He also gives a method using a piece of rubber hose
with a slit in it:

I've never used a pressure-type bleeder.  There is a description and
photo of one pages B-7 2 and 3 of the '50-'62 Bentley.  It's not in the
'63-'67 Bentley.  Basically it's a tank full of brake fluid with some
air space at the top.  You pressurize the air in the tank to 60-70 psi,
then connect a hose from the bottom (liquid) side of the tank to one of
the bleeder valves, open it and the diagonally opposite bleeder valve,
and let it force fluid through the system.

I have read descriptions of similar bleeders in the factory service
manuals for late-model American cars.  I think the usual arrangement
is that the tank has a hose with a cap that replaces the stock master
cylinder cap.  Also, some of the manuals are adamant that the tank
have a diaphragm between the air and the fluid to keep the brake
fluid from getting contaminated.

Snap-On sells a diaphragm type kit online for ~$530 and a non-diaphragm
type tank for ~$200.  http://www.type2.com/library/brakes/brakef.htm
also has some information.
