This is because of the configuration we're using on ht://Dig, the search
software for the archives.  Right now, it doesn't index bare numbers.
Mostly this is because if it does, it will index a lot of "noise" numbers
from dates, times, IP addresses, etc in the headers of messages.  Then,
when you run a search, you tend to get a lot of irrelevant results.  It
is possible to have the software index bare numbers, though.

If anyone has any comments, questions, or suggestions about this, please
email me offlist.  Thanks!
