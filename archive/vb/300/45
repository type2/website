Subject: Mercedes "Bus"

So I posted a message the other day about a 'bus' I saw sitting in a yard.
I only saw it from the rear.  It was a fire truck.  There was only 1 rear
door that opened right to left.  Someone from another list sent me a pick of
the same year bus but as a dormoble camper - very cool.  The fire truck
looked very complete - painted a nice faded out red with a red ladder on the
back and lots o' lights ... since the guy brought it from Germany - maybe
the fire stuff inside has been removed and it's been camperized - I dunno -
maybe I'll go look at it tomorrow and get up close and take a few digipics.
