bleeder. <<

I've tried various one-man-bleeders, including valves,
vac pumps, whatever, and the one that works the best
costs nothing.

Run the bleed hose immediately UP and over the tire.
The hose fills with fluid, and any bubbles that get
in through the loose bleed valve, go up and away 
from the valve itself. The column of fluid that stays
in the hose provides a bit of pressure so that on
the pedal release, no air is sucked back in.

The usual position of the hose running down leaves a
small bubble right at the place you don't want it
resulting in it getting sucked back into the valve.

Press on the brake hard, and release the pedal slowly.
