Subject: '57 Bus in South Africa ~ going cheap !

Seasons Greetings to all,

Spent the weekend rescuing as many busses as possible, relocating them to "bus
friendly" people who don't mind some classic metal beautifying their yard for
a while.

Not my busses mind you, but another South African list member who has avidly
collected them and preserved them as best possible till now.

Now to the point ~ one such bus, a RHD 1957 (semaphores etc), is desperately
seeking an enthusiastic restorer. The bus will need some major TLC, but the
essential bits are there. Pictures of the bus are available from its owner.
(Enquiries will get photos)

Now the snag ~ the bus is in Johannesburg, South Africa. However, for the
right person prepared to do the resto, the owner is prepared to be "extremely
negotiable" on price...

Interested parties can mail me, or contact Christian Figenschou ~

Keep the VW faith !

Cheerio & happy holidays
James
