All things ignition (or at least the part numbers) are revealed at
http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ovhignbo.htm and
http://www.oldvolkshome.com/ignition.htm .  These pages say that
the Bosch VJU 4 BR 8/1 distributor takes 01 003 points and 02 170
condenser.  It looks like at least Bus Depot and BFY Obsolete list
these parts in their catalogs.
