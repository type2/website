Been there, done that. See http://www.vintagebus.com
Search gallery with key words. "jim ellis", "rusty vanbondo" "319-D" and/or see
section of clone buses.

Passed on the oppty to own two of them and passed on them as they were white
elephants at the time. Don't ask, because I don't know of their current
location, condition or availability.
