The switch I use is from Napa (sorry, don't have the
part number on hand).  It's from the 50's or something
and clamps on with a bolt.  It says "Heater" and
lights up, so it should be wired downstream of the
original switch, and inline, so you can use your
original switch and just set it for the speed you
want.  You could hide it, but in heavy rain I change
to a faster speed.

It gives you three speeds but only two are usable
since the third is no resistance.  Oh, and don't touch
the coil on the back when it's in use; it gets HOT.
