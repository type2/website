back when i was talking about flames for my dearly departed (stolen 2/02 and still no word) 1967 beetle several people commented that flames on a rear-engined car didn't make sense.  i offered the thought that the flames were from the incredible speed... the friction between nose and air made flames.  like re-entry dude.  ;-)
