Are the wires on 15 and 30 at the nine-prong box hooked up right?  15
should have a black wire that only has power with the ignition switch on.
30 should have a red wire that always has power.  If these two are
swapped around, it could cause this problem.

Yes.  Besides the above, there are other parts of the system that can
cause that too.  Here are some more possibilities...

1) The red wire (always-on power) on terminal 30 of the nine-prong box is
   loose, broken, or has a poor connection.

2) The brown wire (relay coil ground) between terminal -S of the nine-prong
   box and terminal S of the hazard flasher switch is loose, broken, or
   has a poor connection.

3) The body of the hazard flasher switch is not securely grounded to the
   dash.

4) The hazard flasher switch is defective.

5) Problem with the main relay inside the 9-prong box (broken wire to coil,
   open coil, mechanically stuck, etc.)

You could work around it, but you'd need at least three relays in
addition to the 9-prong box - by that point you're over halfway to
replacing the whole 9-prong box anyway.
