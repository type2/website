Subject: My holiday projects/disc brakes

   I just got confirmation that my Franklin VW Werks narrowed beam and 4
wheel disc brake kit has shipped, watch for updates and pics as I convert a
23 window deluxe to 4 wheel disc brakes and more trick stuff. This is going
to be a test to see how easy their complete system bolts on.

   Project number 2 is my 1960 DD, it too is being lowered. I had Franklins
build me a custom set of lowered spindles to accept standard off road style
wide 5 disc brakes. I feel that if a 100 mph off road car can't break these
hub assemblies, my bus won't come close. This conversion including the
lowered spindles still cost less then a set of CSP wide 5 disc brakes.
   On the rear I am going to try something different for rear disc brakes. I
AM NOT going to use the So Cal  wide 5 cast rear disc brakes as they have
been known to completely shear off the hubs (last set lasted 6 miles!!!!!).

   If all goes well both buses will be at BBB with 4 wheel disc brake
conversions
