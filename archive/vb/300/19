Being frustrated with none of my Buddy L busses having the emblem on front, I went to a sign maker and had some VW logos die cut in metallic silver vinyl to fit.  This cost me $20 for 10 of them.
 
I have 4 left over.  I will make these available FREE to anyone with a Buddly L bus that would like them.  Please be considerate of others and only request what you need, especially since I only have 4 extra.


Enjoy your day!
