Hey Snoopy
This is easy.  Find out what anperage the fuse is for the wipers then go
to Radio Shack.  They should be able to figure out how much power the
rheostat needs to be able to handle, and what the value of restistance
will be needed to drop 13.2V to 7.6V.  From there the selection is
simple.

Or, if I remember my power calculations, P (in watts) = I (current
<amperage>) times E (Voltage)

Hence, Power capacity of the rheostat = (Fuse size) times 6

Then is it E=IsquaredR  Voltage = Current squared times resistance
so 7.2 divided by I (from previous equasion, squared) = Resistanve
needed.

Note that this would be for a simple voltage drop resistor but this
should get you in the ballpark for the resistance and wattage of the
rheostat.

Any electrical engineers feel free to blow away 9th grade electricity
class all you want, I'd be curious to see if I remembered right.
