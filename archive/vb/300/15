Subject: 6V to 12V

I am starting this conversion on my 65 next week.

I have all new bulbs, turn signal relay, voltage drops for wipers, gas gauge
and clock.

12V engine, 12V starter and am prepared to beat and grind on my tranny to
get the flywheel to fit.

I also have a hard start relay installed already.  Will I need to do
anything with this?? It worked with the 6V fine.

I never did find a "How To Convert a 6V bus to a 12V" webpage on this  so I
am going to make one. If anyone knows of anything I left out please pass it
on...

Thanks in advance.

Peace Brothers and Sisters and Happy Holidays,
Snoopy
