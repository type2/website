Subject: Re: [VB] Re: front shift coupler & screw?

Y'all think that's bad?  Try it on a 914.  They're $100!  Then the bushing
inside it (which is all you generally have to replace), which is pretty much
just a piece of very short nylon pipe is $40!  I just went to Home Depot and
got a foot long piece of washing machine hose, and cut it to the right
length and put it in there.  Worked great and cost me $1.97.
