Here are some picks of a SC I found in California---It can  do 20' turning
circles and NO it does not tip over, Koni shocks stick it to the road-- I
took off a Single 48IDA with the manifold, to get through emissions in
Phoenix--I'm open for offers on the carb and manifold--ran great with it
in--, uj, TWWM
