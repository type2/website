Subject: Re: [VB] Anyone using a B4 in their Bus

I don't have heater boxes, I'm running an upright T4.  I did buy a BA6 with
all the switches but thought it may be to big to go under the Bus.  Sounds
like I'd better use the BA6 or opt for a SW under the back seat.  Have no
room in the engine compartment with dual carbs and second battery.
