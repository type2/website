The '67 parts list I have lists 211 721 555, 3514 mm, for LHD
barndoors (up to chassis 20-117 901).  The '54 edition has
211 719 541, 3514 mm, for both LHD and RHD.  Maybe it's a many-
times-superceded part number for a barndoor part?  If so, that
VW dealer might want to add a few extra phone lines... :)
