Subject: clutch/flywheel question

I have a 1200 out of an early bus. A buddy of mine wants to put it in later bus. A 71 camper. He is getting his 1600 rebuilt. What clutch/fly wheel combo does he need. The flywheel on the 1200 is a 6volt I`m pretty sure. The problem I See is that the 71 tranny has the collar for the t/o bearing.  Any suggestions?
Thanks,
Dave
