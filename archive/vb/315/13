Subject: Re: [VB] wil this fit on my '65

           They'll fit.  I've got two sets, one from a 64 and one from a 70
or 71.  I've got the one form the 70/71 in my 66 now.  I compared the two
and they're the same.

This feels good.  After two + years of me bugging everyone on the list with
questions I get to answer one.
