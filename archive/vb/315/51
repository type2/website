Subject: RE: ac unit

Unfortunately, it is a front A/C unit and what I need goes in the back,
where the "headache rack" in a camper normally goes. I would have to see it
up close to see if it would work, but the description says "mounts behind
driver/passenger, over headrests... controls face driver/passenger" which
means the controls are on the back side of the unit... probably wouldn't
work...

But thanks SO much for the heads up!!!

Wasn't someone just looking fro an ac unit? This looks pretty neat, I've
never seen one before...
