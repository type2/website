Subject: Re: [VB] under pedal spash pans - how many kinds?

i went back out to look at mine, as i was only looking at the cut out in
question before. my 57 pan does have some slight differences. the screw
holes on the front lip don't have a factory flare around them, and the
little half oval piece that sticks up on the right side is welded on, rather
than stamped out of the same piece of metal. the cut out in question though
is the same as the later pans. ronnie, do you have one with the cut out like
in the pics? if so, know which year range it is?

the other ronnie
once again educated by the list, now if only i could find some practical use
for this knowledge.
