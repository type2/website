Anybody watching history channel right now?  The VW profile is on and 
they just showed about 3 solid minutes of nothing but barn doors running 
around.  One great section of people moving in to a new house and up 
pulls a '52 smooth gate SC loaded with furnature.  It even had a BD 
Westfalia hitch.  COOL!

Great stuff.
