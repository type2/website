Subject: It's about time...

I have finally started the process of
repairing the collision damage to my '66 Westy after a year and a half of
sitting.  I had her all fixed up...and then evil drugged lady makes a
u-turn, and I get smashed and pushed over embankment.  Rolled on driver's
side.  Now I've cut out most of the really crumpled stuff in the passenger
floor, removed the wasted passenger door, and my porta power is holding the
nose back in shape...hopefully I'll be able to put in the replacement stuff,
and the new door will fit?

We'll see.  It isn't going to be pretty, but then a bus in a field forlornly
sitting is not pretty either.

Camping trip next weekend...optimistic, eh?

Pics available by pmail for anyone with advice/experience....otherwise I do
it MY way!
