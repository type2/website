Subject: RE:67 original ignition

Steve,

That's strange that you warn against rekeying, as, during my resto in
94-95, I disassembled and cleaned all locks, down to removing and cleaning
the pins in all tumblers (does Dave Mayes go that far? ;-) ). They seemed
to be rebuildable from my exploration and cleaning.

Anyway, I will want to set the ign sw up for my existing key, as that is
the key that opens everything except the side doors, and I'm too old to
carry a third key around! You know how these things go... So, I'll prolly
either bug you to do the job, or else Gabe, the other locksmith here.

But first I've got to get the switch, which I believe Clara is going to
bless me with, for an appropriate price!

regards, cal
