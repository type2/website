Subject: RE: [VB] wil this fit on my '65

Kevin,

Those look exactly like the 'jail bars' in my '66 Deluxe.  They mount on to
the rear hatch with sheet metal screws.  They are very cool looking and as
you said, functional too!

I was looking at these rear glass guards, they look pretty cool, and
functional too...the fit a '70, but does anyone know if they would fit on my
'65 kombi?
