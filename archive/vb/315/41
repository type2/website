Hi Duncan,
We have done the same hill climbing tests in our 1960s buses with simular 
results.  This also applies to driving on the flats also.  Not cruising the 
engine at wide open throttle results in cooler running longer lasting engines and 
much better MPG by keeping in the RPMs that they operate, run cool best at.  
  We found two old time VW repair shops that had been around since the 1970s, 
one in Roseburg Ore and the other in Yreka Ca. on I-5.  Both owners regaled 
us with stories of how they did so well due to being on the begining slopes of 
the Syskious Mountains.  That volks flooring it up the slopes more than likely 
would soon require an engine rebuild!
  Another long lost and trusted VW repair shop in Kirkland we used to 
frequent many years ago found that type 4 engined 1972-79 buses would easily go 
200,000 miles between rebuilds and often reached 300,000 miles if maintained 
properly.  That was back when the national speed limit was 55 MPH.  Now a days with 
60, 70, and higher MPH we keep hearing how the type four engine in these buses 
often have to have critical repairs or complete rebuilds in 125,000 or less 
miles.
