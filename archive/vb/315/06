Subject: Re: [VB] Samba Rotisserie

Hey Scott

There is an Ontario bus list called The Bug Pack
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/The_Bug_Pack/) and a local guy built a
rotisserie.  He spun his 59 around on it.  Looked pretty simple - his name
is Travis something.

So ... how's things in Winnipeg - still 20 below?  Did I ever show you pics
of my two Manitoba buses? www.johndillon.com/john

I met a guy here at a show who had a 65 or so westy - very nice bus. He took
it somewhere and had it lifted onto a hoist and sandblasted underneath and
painted.  I saw it 3 or 4 years after it was done and it still looked
amazing.
