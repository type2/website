On that same subject, does anyone know where I can get the materials to
rebuild my springs in my 67 SC 1/3 seat. I have stuffed enough into the
hole already!

Hi all,
Does anyone know where I can locate an original bench seat for my 66
S/C. Previous owner stuffed bucket seats in there. I would like to get
back to the original look of the vehicle. Thanks    Bob
