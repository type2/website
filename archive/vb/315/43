Subject: Re: [VB] anyone have  L-31 Dove Blue PPG mixing code

The best thing you can do in this instance is find an old paint dealer
with some early vehicle books--

The computer's are plugged in for late model stuff only.
A Dupont dealer would be a good place to start--

Once you have that Dupont number--it can be cross referenced to any
paint mfg's codes.

I would suggest PPG using materials too--the best, most durable, and
easiest to work with--

Later,
