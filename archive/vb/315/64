Subject: Couple of Camper interior questions?

I'm ordering carpet to do my Camper conversion.  It will be used around the
seats and front floor.  The floor in the Camper are may get tile.

1.  If using plywood, in the camper floor; What thickness does folks use and
do you screw it down to the floor?

2. Do you have carpet under the back cushion?

3. Would someone measure the camper bed; from the floor to top of seat
cushion.  From arm rest deal to bottom of westy window.  I have alignment type
issue I want to see if I'm off.
