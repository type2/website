Subject: Freshly built 1641 engine FS-Delivery to Everybus OK

Hey Y'all,
I aquired a professionally rebuilt 1641 long block
engine in a trade for another bus. I decided that I
need money more than I need a new engine so it is for
sale or trade. $500 gets it and I'll even deliver it
to Everybus for free!  Here's a link with pix and more

You know you need it!!
