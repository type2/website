Subject: Re: [VB] Need 67 ignition sw - not repop

Give Gabriel a call.  He's pretty much THE key guy.  Just tell him you've
got a '67 bus and give him a key code.  He probably has an NOS ignition he
can sell you, and will rekey it to match your bus.  His number is
209-462-2851.  I had him rekey an NOS ignition for my bus and make a spare
set of keys for me.  They work great.
