Subject: RE:67 original ignition

I do have several used 67 ignitions in stock.  Although they can be 
disassembled and rekeyed, the Volkswagen keying manual advises not to, as 
that lock was really not meant to be disassembled.  We advise not to rekey 
if at all possible.  Note that I'm not saying it can't be done, just that it 
shouldn't be done.  The integrity of the lock is just not as good when taken 
apart and reassembled.  I've done it numerous times, but do not recommend 
it.  I'm in the UK at present but will be back in the shop on the 30th.
