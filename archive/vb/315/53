Subject: Need 67 ignition sw - not repop

Volks folks,

I need a ignition switch for my 67 deluxe - original is on its last legs.
I'm looking for either one in great condition (original) or NOS OG. I do
not want a reproduction unit, as I've heard bad things about 'em. Just
want an original. Wanna get it keyed up before this one takes its final
bow.

Thanks!
