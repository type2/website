Subject: VW lovers, want a Bullmastiff?

We have one Bullmastiff puppy left. Her name is Empi. (aside from the VW
"Empi" it's short for "KDF's Empire strikes back"). If there are any list
members who are looking for a Bullmastiff puppy we would love to see her go to
another VW Family. She is a beautiful very dark brindle girl. She is CKC
registered, vet checked, microchipped, had first shots, and is dewormed. Pet
price is $1000, show/breed price is $1800. Could easily be AKC registered. She
is out of our CH "Only Samba For Me" who was bred to the #1 Bullmastiff in
Canada "Janhamers So Irresistabull".
