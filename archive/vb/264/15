I'm gonna use the naked lady ones I think.

Got some "flamed" ones, but might have to consider doing the "General Lee"

>antlers of some sort on front of cab?

I've got a ram skull from one of my dead Barbado that I had saved for the

I need about $100 for tires and maybe at best $35 for inspection and other

I'll try and sum up all the costs at the end and post some pictures.
