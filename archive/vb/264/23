OK, You made me do a little research on this.  It is
NOT an urban legend.  Two bugs were taken from my
local FLVWAPS.  However, I just discovered that this
was due to an overzealous local cop.

the DMV has determined to contain the VIN. 

Not true, I'm afraid.  After the cars sat in the
Albuquerque impound lot for over a year, an agreement
was reached (it may have helped that the gung-ho cop
died in an auto accident) that they could have the
vehicles back BUT they had to be installed on an older
chassis!

Seems buying old VIN's and stamoping them into new
metal doesn't make it with our local cops.
