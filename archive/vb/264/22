Subject: Re: mexican beetle

  No bus content but Im replying to a no bus content post anyways..

How they do it: (not all but most)
- Drag a 18 wheeler full of beatup 68-71 pans (tunnels pretty much) to 
mexico
- Have the locals (cheaper labor) put everything off the new one onto the 
pan,
restoring the floors and all I hope but who knows.
- bring back 'new' 1968 beetles to the us.
Of course what you are getting is a $11k car with no warantee thats been 
taken
completely apart. I wanted one a while back but ended up no doing it.
The police most likely did not take the cars from whoever in albuquerque,
the DOT did. They took one from a friend of mine here too.
He: had the 68 pan (restored)
     : had the free labor (owns a shop)
     : drove the beetle back from mexico with mexican plates
     : was dumb enough to pop a florida plate on it and leave it in front of 
his shop.
They showed up asking where it was as it had been recorded leave mexico and 
not
returning,  he showed them, they gave him his plate back and crushed it by 
the best
of his knowlege...  The funny part is legality asside, whats the difference 
with it
being 'unsafe and not in compliance' registered as a 68 vs. a 2002. None 
really, i guess
just doesnt establish the trend of 'bring it all here and drive it, we love 
it'.. There are
several i know of in florida done like this (68) and *ONE* ive seen 
registered as a 2001,
and here legally.
