I better get some cables then, thanks for the quick reply,   the  '63 backing
ones are up high ,the '64  has them on the bottom of the backing plate. I'm
trying a 3.88 rancho we'll see if the 1776 has enough uph..          Lloyd

  I put a '65 tranny in my '61 DC and had to use the '65 e-brake cables due to
the way the cables mount on the backing plates.  Worked fine for me.  Cable
cost about $8 at the local FLAPS.
