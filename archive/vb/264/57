well, you can't swap it straight over, like he says because of the RGBoxes, 
also the nose cone.

BUT, if you want a tranny for your bus and find a swing axle one from a bug 
(or ghia), you can remove the type 1 tubes and axles, then remove the outer 
ring of nuts and swap the ring gear to the other side, install bus axles and 
tubes/RGBoxes and  swap over the nose cone & hockey stick, you now have a bus 
tranny.  (think split case nose cone is same for bus and bug, but tunnel case it 
will not have themounting match up to the body)  You see, the RGears change the 
spin to the other way, so that is why the ring gear has to be on flipped, so 
it turns the other way and that cancels out the RGBoxes or like he said you 
have 4 reverse and one forward gear.

the other issue is bugs came with .89 4th and buses/ghias with .82 4th, so 
you may find you have a lower 4th gear.  I had a bug 4th in my 65 when I bought 
the bus, so someone had done this to it.

the center section has bug parts numbers on it. (look in online parts list) 
The bug spring plates and bus spring plates are different, so bug axles don't 
bolt to bus spring plates, nor RGBoxes to bug ones.  That is why lowered buses 
with no RGBoxes have to have modified spring plates.  I have seen baja bugs 
with RGBoxes in them, and I guess they have modified or bus spring plates in 
them.

 One of my sons claims you can't swap out a bug and bus tranny because

 you put a bug tranny in it, and visa-versa.
 
 Is this true?  I thought the RGB's had enough gears in them that the
 tranny turned the same way as a bugs?
 
 Yeah, I know . . . stupid.
