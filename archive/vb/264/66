Re 15 gallon tank in '65

I put a 15 gallon tank in my '63 SC. Easiest thing in the world as long as you
got the filler neck and hose along with the 15 gallon tank. You'll have to
provide an external vent line from the vent port on the tank.. The 10 gallon
tank vented through the fill port...the 15 gallon tank does not.

This would be a good time to blow out the line between the fuel pump and the
tank, or to replace any of the line that looks suspicious.
