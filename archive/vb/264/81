It's sad to see a bus owner with such a dilemna.
I feel the need to ammend my previous post.

There is nothing wrong with restoring a vehicle with a new engine and paint.
If you pay, you have the right to expect the work to be done as agreed.
If you have a problem with the agreement, and the bus is in the shop,
you have little more to rely on other than what is on your document.
You are subject to any potential additional fees the shop may attach
If you have to pursue a legal situation, the key is to remove the
bus from that shop. As long as they have it, they are in control.
They have offered to make good on a serious engine problem, but it
is unlikely that repair will be satisfactory. In fact, they have caused
the problem, and it is your good nature they are appealing to allow
them to goop it up and get rid of you. Beware. Take a legal witness
( the tow truck driver ) get them to make statements ( in front of
other prospective clients:).Use whatever excuse you can to remove
the bus prior to any legal action. Pay any bill with a credit card.
Having the bus back home is key. There is always another way.
