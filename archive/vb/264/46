Subject: RE: [VB] single port v dual port

Stick with the single port... my tipper and firebus both have single
port 1500s in them and they do just fine.  You'll loose some horsepower
but it sounds like that isn't that important to you.

Kevin asked:
I have a single port, the engine before that was a single port...but Bob
is
recommending dual port. I don't quite understand the advantages and
disadvantages to each...I think with a single port-the engine is not
working
as hard and with a dual port I would get better acceleration. I don't
care
much about my acceleration...
