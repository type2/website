Subject: Wiper shaft question, Safari windows

I need to repair or replace the outer brass threaded
part on my Safari wipers.

Does anyone know were to get raw stock in the right
thread for the outer wiper shafts?  Just the threaded
brass.  

OR

anyone know what the thread is?  Anyone have a tap for
this?  (Pitch and diameter)

thanks
Matt
