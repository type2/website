A body shop may not be the best place for engine repair.
A defective new rear main seal is highly unlikely, but would be
a warranty issue with the new engine builder.
The cracked engine mount problem clearly is the fault of the installer.
There is NO way to "repair" a cracked new engine case
and guarantee a full service life equal to the new case with no crack.
The cheap repair is JB Weld, a plastic epoxy glue which will
stop oil leaks, but does not have the strength to serve as a
motor mount bonding agent.
The best repair is magnesium welding, which will
require a very specialized skill and the welder will know if
the repair can be made without engine disassembly.
This is as good as it gets, but still not the same as no damage.
This engine should first be inspected by an authorized Volkswagen
repair facility, to provide a legal statement of damage repair.
You will likely lose all warranty from the engine builder,
but they can provide a legal statement for your situation
with the installer, which you clearly need.
Perhaps you should post some photos of the damage,
and suspend the repair pending documentation.
You may be entitled to a replacement engine.
The odds of getting one improve with documentation and
your ability to pursue the offender.
Never state what you WILL do in pursuit, do it.
An attorney will provide a strong incentive.
A state-authorized shop has to respond or lose their lisence.
Your complaint will require documentation.

The body shop situation is not good. If you are unhappy
with the service, take the bus home and start over.
You need a written contract listing dates of completion of
separate stages of repair and pay by agreed installments
with the big payment at completion.
Document everything with photos.
