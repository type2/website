Subject: Re: [VB] single port v dual port

Dual port has a few more horsepower than SP.   DP also has less metal between 
the intake place and the spark plug hole, so are more likely to crack.  I 
kill DP motors, driving around as I do in a bus especially when I haul stuff.  
Then I pull the motor, heads, check ps, cs, rings, rod bearing, end play and end 
up switching to SP.   

it's a power ve reliability issue.    Sort of like 1600 vs. 1641.

I think you can get away with it in a bug better than a bus.

 I have a single port, the engine before that was a single port...but Bob is
 recommending dual port. I don't quite understand the advantages and
 disadvantages to each...I think with a single port-the engine is not working
 as hard and with a dual port I would get better acceleration. I don't care
 much about my acceleration...
