Subject: big nut/small nut tranny & bay rear drums

--Does this refer to the 36mm vs. 46mm nut?

--I have large lug bolts on my 65, and my vwflapsman said I have 68-71 rear drums. Does that mean the brake baking plate, drum, cylinders, shoes and hardware should be ordered as 68-71? Has anything else been changed to perform this swap?

thanks,

Billy
