Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS, cell phones and help on the road

I had a similar problem a few weeks back. The person was speaking so fast
that I had to replay the message several times to get the number.  It was a
guy and the number I finally figured out after listening to both messages
several times was a girl's cell phone. I left a message but never heard
back. If I had the right phone number I will never know.

I hope they got what they needed..

Remember if your leaving messages on an answering machine, especially if you
don't know them, speak slowly and repeat the phone number. if you want them
to call you back...
