Dual port 1600 has more bottom end torque. There was a definite improvement on
hauling up the hills with my truck with a DP. I have an SP on the shelf to put
back in it if I ever sell it.

I have heard that a single port 1600 has more torque than a dual port motor is
that true?  Also what is the approx. hp difference anyway like 1-4% or so? (
this would assume same engine builder same carb, exhaust, carb etc.. )
