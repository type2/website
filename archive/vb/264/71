Subject: 1961 front bus seats.  

Has anyone out there redone a front seat for a 61
lately or know any details about them?  This seat has
the hump in  the middle.  I need to get covers and
pads for my 61 DC and was wondering exactly what makes
that seat have the hump.  Is is the frame or the pads?
 Will covers and foam that TMI and others sell fit
this type of seat too? 

I also have an original pattern for a 60 DC and was
wondering if that would work should i stitch my own.

Thanks for the help.

Matt
