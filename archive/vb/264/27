Remember the old Tex Avery cartoons with the Wolf in the yellow Zoot Suit? 
Remember the whistle he makes when he sees a pretty girl? You know the 
whistle. Same whistle YOU make when you see a pretty girl...at least if 
your a sexist pig like me.

Well now my Double Cab is a sexist pig...with a driver who's got a very 
liberal eye for beautiful females.
