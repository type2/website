Subject: single port v dual port

Hey guys,

Just got a hand yesterday from rob in pulling the engine-then we did a quick
compression check on his engine(125-135) looks good to me....

My engine case has a huge hole ripped in the top of it...obviously time for
a new engine, I am not sure what is left/can be saved from the original
engine. I am planning on going to see Bob at Boston Engine today hopefully,
with my longblock...

I have a single port, the engine before that was a single port...but Bob is
recommending dual port. I don't quite understand the advantages and
disadvantages to each...I think with a single port-the engine is not working
as hard and with a dual port I would get better acceleration. I don't care
much about my acceleration...

I do have a set of single port heads, that were reconditioned(not sure of
the terminology) back when I was in Houston. These have been sitting in oil
(sprayed on) since then (approx 2 years). I thought I should be able to
reuse these, and save some money...I think that also means I would not have
to buy new engine tin and I don't know what else is different between the
two.

Any suggestions out there?


-Kevin
