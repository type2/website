Even with leaner jets you could be leaking around the base or throttle shaft
and that may be where you are getting the rich smell from. I would also check
all the fuel lines. A friend of mine worried all over his dual carbs on his 66
squareback and come to find out after his fire that it was a leaky fuel pump
diaphragm gasket.
