Subject: 1961 Double Cab... 07-31-03

Today, after helping my son repair his "Big Wheel",  I ended up 
scrounging up the bolts needed to mount the front bumper onto the '61 
Double Cab. Turns out I had plenty of 'em, so I didn't waste time 
going to the hardware store to get nuts and bolts for the rear 
bumper. I just proceeded to mount the front one.

The bumper was still a little tweaked even after working on it 
yesterday, but I used some longer bolts on the side mounts and was 
able to pull it all together. I used some holes already in the bumper 
to mount a piece of angle iron right on the top middle of it. I then 
mounted one of those license plate holders on there. This bumper is 
stripped down to just the blade, so this made a nice way to get the 
plate mounted where I wanted using existing holes.

Not that it mattered, the bumper is ugly anyway. I guess it just 
seemed to make sense to use what was there. I've been doing that a 
lot on this bus. Not making anymore holes or mods to it. But also not 
really "fixing" any of the ones already there. Basically just keeping 
that kind of stuff "as is".

After getting the front bumper mounted up I sprayed it all again with 
some flat black paint and called it a day. I should get paid 
tommarrow and can think about getting some of the last stuff on my 
list done.

Also made some cash selling an old "claw foot bath tub" we had picked 
up for cheap a while back. Decided not to use it, so put it in the 
Thrifty Nickel. Man those things are heavy! But definitely helps to 
get a slight injection of cash on those last few days of the month, 
especially when you've blown your cash stash on busses and guitar 
amps...the kind of stuff that's priority...right!?!?!?
