Unless you are using a pre 74 DP, all the DP heads were thickened up and all
the replacement SP heads were beefed up too. If you buy a new VW head, either
flavor, you will only get the thick heads. Most of the aftermarket heads are
also thicker.

Is this true with the Mexican long-reach heads?  I'm pretty certain that
they went to long reach plugs to beef up that crack-prone area.
