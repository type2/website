Subject: 1961 Double Cab... 08-01-03

Today my 1961 Double Cab is officially street legal!

I got off work around 3:30 and ran home to take the truck to get it 
inspected. I had planned on emptying the bed of all the parts and 
tools and general junk I've piled in there while working on it. But 
then I thought, "Why?"

So I changed clothes and headed down the street. There's a 
neighborhood garage about 4-5 blocks from my place I've done 
inspections at before, so that's where I went. I ended up having to 
wait on the guy while he ran errons for like 30 minutes. But I was 
here, so I just was patient.

The guy doing the inspection is a BIG FAT GUY. Now, if you've ever 
met me you know I'm far from skinny. But since I've recently lost 40 
of the 60 pounds I planned to lose, I am feeling a little more snooty 
towards the thin impaired folks. But either way, this guy weighs 
300-350 pounds or something. BIG guy. And it's ALL in the middle.

Point of all this is that he has much trouble squeezing up into the 
front seat. But he finally prevails and drives the bus into his bay. 
It takes him twice as long to get out. But he eventually does. He 
goes through the motions as we talk about VW's. He checks my 
insurance fills out my sticker and slaps it on the window...crooked! 
Oh well. Rat Bus...right!?!?!

I came into my house with my arms up in the air like I just beat the 
living daylights out of Irish Mickey Ward for 12 rounds. My wife 
congratulates me. I tell her I'm going to the hardware store to get 
some fasteners and I'm gonna take the boy. She says, "Not in that 
thing unless it's got seatbelts!" I'm instantly thrust back down to 
earth from my "king of the world" attitude. So I grab the keys to the 
suburban, grab the boy, and went and got the nuts, bolts, and washers 
I needed.

When we got back I slammed the front license plate on. Then I bolted 
up the rear bumper. This is an early bay bumper and the brackets 
don't fit exactly right. But guess what, I made 'em work. Just forced 
the issue, bolted things as tight as theyd go and left it that way. 
I'll need to go back and do it right sometime, but for now the bumper 
is fine. I stood on it and bounced and it didn't move. And the 
brackets are not hitting any of the truck body...though it's close. I 
sprayed some more flat black on the bumper and called it macaroni.

I also grabbed an old bus exhaust pipe and welded it up to the 
muffler on the engine. The muffler on the engine is a bug muffler 
with one of the ports welded up (the correct one). I welded a bracket 
on the other side of the muffler and went to mount the pipe. Things 
were gonna be a pain in the ass with the clamps, so I just broke out 
the welder and got to it. After I got it real good I fired up the 
engine. There are still a few pin hole leaks, but I'll hit it again 
in the moring when I'm fresh.

All in all a good day. Got the truck where I can cruise a little if I 
want to. I'm probably going to start working on the wheels to get 'em 
ready for a new set of tires. I don't really want to drive the truck 
much until I get those on there. It'll do SOOOO much for the look of 
the thing.

But it did look REAL cool sitting in the sun waiting for the 
inspection. Flat black and chrome baby!
