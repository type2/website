Your son is correct, BUT...

If you only swap axles and install the bug tranny in the split bus, 
then you have 4 gears reverse and one forward.

BUT

The differential unit (including the ring gear) is made to be mounted 
into the tranny from either side.  To make the bug tranny work in the 
split bus, you must remove the differential assembly and then 
re-install it on the opposite side of the tranny.

I did this in my first bus when I was 15 years old, back in the early 
70's.  And yes, there was plenty of $15 per ounce Mexican around in 
those days...
