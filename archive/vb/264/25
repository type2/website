I believe you will find these are labled "Experimental", which changes all 
the rules...  If you could build your own car (and why not, using VW parts) 
then you could get away with your own serial number.

Why not import a Beetle "kit" from Mexico, rather than send your pan down 
there?  Just like buying a replacement fender, on a slightly larger scale...
