I wouldn't even try to get one in unless it was for
display only.  They are illegal here.  Everyone who
bought one here in Albuquerque a while back lost their
car.  The police just came and took them.

They do not comply with DOT regulations.  Two things I
know are in noncomplience are the gas tank (if in
front of the axle, it must be plastic), and the
windshield is tempered, not laminated.  There probably
are other problems, too.
