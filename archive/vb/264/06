Are you sure this isn't urban legend. the process is a gray thing, but
essentially you have a verified piece of metal that the DMV has
determined to contain the VIN. Everything else is replaced (i.e.
restored) with something that is new. so essentially to the letter of
the law you have a restored bug.

but what I would like to know is what gave the police the right to
take property back? If it was an import type thing I would suspect the
Federal gov would be the one to concern themselves with this, not the
locals. I can easily see the locals pulling the tags to make sure the
vehicle doesn't stay on the road (since they declaired it illegal) but
to take a car is a bit much. Do you have any sources of this seisure?
