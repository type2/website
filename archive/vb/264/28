I ran my first one directly into a tank and the engine was on a pressure "on
demand" switch so that it started up everytime the pressure dropped below the
preset. I first saw one at Pete Love Volkswagen in Fife WA, and it was set up
on a 500 gal tank and the exhaust was vented through the wall. It was the air
for the whole service department.

Hello Guys    I have been using one of these for years . I work real well
sandblasting, the air will be hot and stinks some. I had trouble running some
air
tools like a DA sander as it would gum up the tool.I run mine at half trottle
for serious blasting. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service
