You probably already have these items in mind, but in case youse don't:

"yosemite sam" mud flaps?

substitute the front license plate w/ a confederate flag plate?

Hooters bumper sticker?

spare spare tire sitting on edge in the truck bed?

spot/search light on front?

antlers of some sort on front of cab?


Can't wait for payday to see the finished product-in fact how much $$$ do
