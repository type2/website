A buddy of mine here has a guy whose got tons of surplus "industrial 
equipment" paint. Same stuff I think. He sells it to us for $10 a gallon! 
The colors are limited, but all the basics are there. So far my buddy has 
painted about 4 VW rails, 2 trailers, 2 fiberglass buggys, and 3 bugs with 
the stuff. It turns out pretty darn good and seems to be very tough. I'm 
gonna shoot it on my wife's thing one of these days.

Also I THINK the volksrod guys used the black tractor paint for their flat 
black look.
