which handle is it? they are differnt for the different doors

you may want to contact the locksmith.

The other thing is, the cylinder is held in with a set screw.  if it was not 
snug (too tight make the cylinder not turn) the lock could feel sloppy. 

 Solution:   remove handle, snug set screw.  turn key a few times to make 
sure it's not too tight or too loose (it should turn freely w/o friction), 
paint over set screw with nail polish, reinstall handle.

set screw location is different depending on whether it's front door, cargo 
door, rear hatch handle.  But not hard to find.  you need a teeny screwdriver.
