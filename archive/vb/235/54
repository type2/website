  My wheel does sit a little cocked . I had to adjust it also by moving the
angle brackets a little. I do have it nose heavy . Mine only shakes at 75 to
80 mph. I had to slow my cruising speed down to 72 to keep it from shaking.

I'll take a few pics, send 'em on over.  I had to have the trailer towed
from San Jose to livermore after BYOB because it was really shaking around.
I mean REALLY shaking around! I have since replaced the wheel bearings but I
am at the end of my list of possible solutions. I thought maybe my bumper
was flexing to much thus causing the shakes but I am still not sure. It
(trailer) rocks left to right on occasion, not up and down. It's almost like
the wheel isn't re-centering itself or the bearings were shot and allowing
the wheel to pitch left to right.  Does your wheel look like it is cocked to
one side? I straightened mine out as it was cocked to one side, maybe I
shouldn't have? Also, do you level your trailers out? I do. The arms I have
are straight as far as I can tell, I was even lucky enough to get two sets
but one of them would only work with euro bumpers as they are wider. I had
some U shaped brackets made for the mounting and they sit a little above
center on the bumper, but I don't think that should make a difference.  Sean
