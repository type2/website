Subject: popout latch

I just realized that I am missing a popout latch, I thought I had an
extra to replace a broken one that was installed but it appears that I
do not.  If anyone has access to one that I could purchase I would
appreciate it as I am limited in my salvage yard options.
  Except for the latch my popouts are installed (minus the inner seal
and headlining), I just have to wash off the hand soap that provided the
lubrication for the new seals.  I will post pictures soon.
