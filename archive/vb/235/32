It has the big back window like a '66 and later. That and those custom 
rear wheelwells make it real special. You have to wonder what other 
mysteries a little sandpaper would reveal.

I just looked at the ad agian. It says "original" so I guess that's a 
special factory big rear window, not somebody's hack. It must really be 
worth the price. 8^)
