"Volkswagen - the German/international conglomerate
replaced its former glory with the more powerful,
streamlined EuroVan in 1991 - is anything but

"Of course, our main focus is to sell new cars, but we're
aware that our brand has a unique heritage," said

headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich. "We're certainly
grateful for that love people have for our brand." 

Am I the only one reading this?  What a load of horse sh!t!!  This guy
did research??   Sounds like the party line to me.

Good article yes, but.  Don't believe everything you hear from a
corporation.  Been seeing what Halliburton and Bechtel are saying lately?
