  Hey Cal. if you are heading down I40 to Cali from NM stop by and say hi. I
am 17 miles off of I 40 on route 95 in Lake Havasu. I have been the stopover
for most travelers heading West. 550 miles from AL, NM.

Gary,

Made it to OKC Sunday evening, no problems - I had had a strange knocking
coming from the rear end on that trip - intermittent. Wierd. When I
pressed the clutch
in, it went away. Turns out that when I checked the tranny oil level
before leaving for out west, it was over a quart low! There'd been no
leaks since the rebuild in 00, so I never checked it! Dumb! Anyway, I
refilled it with my last GL-4 gear oil, checked the boxes too, they needed
a couple ounces each. Doesn't seems as  if  I ruined the tranny, it sounds
normal, shifts smoothly. From now on, I'll check it regularly, like the
rest of us bussers do, right? ;-)

I leave OKC for ABQ,NM on Wednesday morning - should take about 10 hours.
Visiting there for a day or so, then leaving for Cupertino, CA by friday
morning.

I never announced to the list that I was traveling across. Maybe I should
just for the record - folks like to hear about that kind of thing!

Thanks for standing by, I'll let you know when I get there.

regards, cj
