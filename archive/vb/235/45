Subject: another cooling report

I got to play with a new toy, an air flow meter.    It measures temperture 
and air flow.

measuring at the right defroster vent with the foot heat shut off, my 61 
deluxe kicks air out at about 10 m/s at 55mph in 4th gear.   I was surprised. 
 :0  At idle it's about 1.5 m/s.   My 65 kicks out more (being a type 23 with 
only front heat vents, and a small gen pulley)

One funny thing was that the air flow actually went DOWN when I open the 
little triangular vent wing.  Dropped by 0.9 m/s.    This may have something 
to do with the leaky paper bag effect, also that a back popout was open.   
Just really surprised me.  well, maybe it shouldn't have as it does feel 
colder with that window open.

My crappy heater kicked out 54.4 C air after about 20 minutes or so (I didn't 
really keep track of time) with it 17 C outside

Shoot, I forgot to measure flow in at the vents.
