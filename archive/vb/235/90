I'm assuming you are installing a "modified" T-4 without its heater boxes? Is
that why you're asking about alternate heat sources?

Hello all,
I am installing a type 4 engine into my '67 deluxe which means bye bye
heater boxes. Can I get a concensus on what my fellow type 2 owners believe
to be the best auxiliary heating source? Should I look for a gas heater and
if so which model would be best as a retrofit? I am in your debt. BTW the
original engine goes into storage for that day when the bus changes hands,
again.
