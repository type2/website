Vapor barrier goes between the door panel and the door.

If you got the POR-15 to cover everywhere, then you would not need the vapor
barrier. It's interesting stuff. Paint dries faster with less humidity.
POR-15 dries faster the more humid it is. The more humid it is, the better
it works, quite the opposite of paint.  Whenever I get the time, I plan on
undercoating my bus with the stuff.
