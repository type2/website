I enjoyed the bus story in the Arizona Daily Star and sent a message to Rob 
Bailey who wrote it. Here's our correspondance:

Hello Rob,

I'm a resident of San Angelo, TX, but was given a link to your story via
your newspaper website.

I have to tell you that you did a great job on the story. Very well done.
You summed up everything there is about the modern day bus owners.

I enjoyed the story so much that I've given the link to friends, family
members, and co-workers so that they could read it. It just really makes it
clear that there is a community out there of us folks and that we're not
just a bunch of hippies.

Again, very well done.

Hey Rex,

I can't thank you enough for the positive words. I write about a lot of stuff
on deadline, and often don't have time to give stories a second thought.

The people I met doing this one, however, made me want to really bash some
stereotypes about bus owners. I'm relieved to hear that at least one of you
guys felt it represented the community well.

Take care,
rob
