"They were attracted to a simpler, less expensive machine
for homegrown maintenance reasons. There's a big kitsch
associated with VWs. Hippiedom, crystals, tie-dye
T-shirts. A lot of these people go in for that."

Good thing people don't lump us all into that blasted stereotype!
Somebody shoot me please if they ever seem me wearing a F'ing tye-dye
anything!!!
