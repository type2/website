If you still get leaks, you might have the same problem I had.  Apparently
a DPO had really cranked down hard on the air horn screws and warped the
air horn - assembled dry with normal torque, I could get an .006" feeler
gauge in the gap.  I lapped both halves (air horn and body) down to better
than .002" with a piece of glass and some valve grinding compound, cleaned
it up really well to get rid of all the compound, and put it together with
a new gasket - no leaks.
