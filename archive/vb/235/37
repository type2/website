My SO has a 79 camper now. She doesn't let me drive it. I get 
expressions of concern from her about my 65 bus, 57 DD van, and 66 bug. 
We also have a 92 Colt and 92 Cabriolet. The neighbors haven't said they 
object but I wouldn't want to be offensive. We agree how very economical 
that buses are and how fun they are to drive. I really believe what 
someone on the list wrote about going somewhere in other vehicles and 
BEING somewhere in a split bus. I know it's just mind games and the 
illusions just veil our attention from deeper truths. We have lots of 
fun with our vehicles. I remember back when I was in high school in 
1964, I had a 1960 van with a bastard engine. It only costed $400. That 
same van now would be worth at least $4000 (no dents, rust, or 
scratches. Interior pretty new) Back then lots of the guys had vans to 
use to spend the weekend at the beach surfing at Malibu, Rincon, Santa 
Monica and once in a while go to Santa Barbara and beyond. That was 
before hippies. Once all the hippies took over buses, I bailed out and 
got a 55 Porsche speedster. But I diverge.
