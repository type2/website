Oh   And by the way it was me and Terry Wolfe and Wade Rodman in Iowa and
Erin 'NQ" in Beatrice that helped the guy out.  They called me and I called
Erin and got a trannie sent to Lincoln.  Terry Wolfe went to Lincoln and got
the trannie and took it to Council Bluffs to Wade Rodman's where the guy was
put up by them and used there tools and garage.  AIRS is GOOD

 screwing for virginity

It's hard to make a comeback
