Subject: Release bearing frustration

Spent a couple of hours on the 65 this weekend.  Pulled the engine back 
out to work on a couple of things.

Did the drill-and-jig with the heat riser, got a lot of crud out of 
there and blew air through it.  Sealed it with RTV, a scrap of thin 
metal, and a hose clamp.  Seems to have improved the transition off 
idle.  Also noticed when removing the manifold that two of the flange 
nuts were a little loose -- I may have had a vac leak as well.

Reinstalled the air flaps, though my repo case has no stud or drilling 
for the thermostat.  Gonna think on that for a while, but they're there 
(safety wired open) if I decide I want to drill & tap the case.

Screws holding the top half of the carb on were a little loose, too -- 
I was getting some gas seepage.  Think that's done.

Bent the heater cable tubes up (a PO had cut them loose near the rear 
end anyway) and was able to get the cables attached to the heater box 
levers, but I think I'll need to do some tweaking still to get 
everything just right.

Replaced front oil seal, gland nut, pressure plate, and release 
bearing.  Made a world of difference!  And then damn if today at lunch 
the new release bearing didn't start howling.  (-at-)#$%^!   I really don't 
want to pull the engine back out to deal with my Clutch Curse again, 
but I guess I'll have to if it keeps up.  I'm gonna call the FLAPS and 
gripe about the bearing.....

Tonite I soothed myself by bending curtain rods for the jalousies out 
of 1/2" wide aluminum strips.  "Inspired by Westfalia" and looks 
reasonably good.  Now to take a deep breath and start cutting my 
curtain fabric to size.
