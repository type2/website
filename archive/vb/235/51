Subject: RE: [VB] Trailer Mounts

  I have an allstate bumper mount bracket, but it does not work with the
clam shell allstate I have. The clamshell has a totaly different mounting
system then my flat/bed box allstate and my Harris.
  I will take pictures of all 3 trailers, the bumper bracket and the hitch I
made and post them on the Samba for comparrison

Not the pivot / spring, but the other smaller pieces.

Not the best picture, but you get the idea. I will take detailed photos 
tomorrow

They are adjustable and clamp to the bumper bracket. I use these for my 
Allstate, Coffman, and my Montgomery Wards before I sold it.
