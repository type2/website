Subject: Re: [VB] rubber undercoat in doors?

I used 1" thick styrofoam w/ foil on one side and plastic on the other to
insulate my kombi. Before I had a big problem with moisture due to the cold
metal inside would attact moisture during the night and in the morning the
whole roof and sides would be wet. I mean like dripping wet. Installed the
styrofoam panels and no more moisture. Between that and padded carpet boards
on the floor and parcel deck it quited it down allot. The styro panels were
about 7 bucks each at Lowes for a 1" x 4' x 8' sheet and it took like 4-5
sheets to do the whole bus. Now if I could just get time to finish the 2
worse places to panel......the roof and the rear corners...... Got a DD
Panel to get rolling so I guess it waits......lol.
