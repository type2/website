Subject: GL 4 gear oil

   Was reading my new issue of Popular Mechanics and came across a flyer
inserted by CarQuest, looking through it I found that they carry straight GL
4, 90 weight gear oil. Whenever I called my local CarQuest they said they
didn't carry it, but in the flyer they do. What it is is TRACTOR gear oil. I
asked them for tractor 90 weight GL4 and low and behold they had 2 5 gallon
pails in stock. $27.50 for 5 gallons, was 21.95 up till last week when a
sale they had ended. So here is another option of getting it instead of from
NAPA.
  Carquest part number is 990-05 for 5 gallons and 990-01 for 1 gallon.
Another thing I noticed is they have TRACTOR paint with rust inhibitor. I
also order some of it in GRAY to do the undercarriages of my buses with.
