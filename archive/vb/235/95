Pink fibreglass insulation holds water.   

it may be okay to use if you live in the desert, but remember that water runs 
through the cab doors, and a vapor barrier keeps water off the door panel 
(which is a good thing) but not out of the door.

It is very difficult to seal perfectly, and air can carry moisture in the 
crack in the moisture barrier, or around the edge.  Cracks can occur over 
time because of driving and bouncing around teh roads.  I live in the PNW, 
and have seen the damage fibreglas does in doors and the sides of buses.   I 
think fibreglas has no place in buses.   Sprayfoam is evil.

 Last fall I insulated behind all my panels with the pink fiberglass
 insulation from Home Depot which made a HUGE difference in sound proofing,
 as well as giving my doors a "whump" noise when they close from the original
 "clang" noise they previously were. If you put in insulation like that, it
 is important that you do not compress the insulation, as it works best that
 way (you have to peel away layers of insulation to get it the correct
 thickness, one roll ends up being enough for an entire bus unless you're
 doing the roof as well), and make sure you install a vapor barier (plastic
 sheet) to keep condensation from rotting your bus away as the insulation can
