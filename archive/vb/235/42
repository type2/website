Subject: Re: [VB] Trailer Mounts

Sean,

I recently picked up the same model Allstate you and Ronnie have.  Mine came
with mounting brackets and all the hardware, but it would mount right up to
the bumper.  If you are interested I can send you a couple of pics.  Do you
have any of the bracket hardware.  From the pics it looks as though you
might have the arms.

Let me know,
Aaron

> Does anyone, especially Ronnie, have a pic of the mount for their single
wheel trailer and even dimensions. I am thinking about getting another rear
bumper and having a hitch made for it rather than punching holes in the
bumper again.  Secondly, know anyone who could make one?   Sean 65 Westfalia
