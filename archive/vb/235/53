Subject: Re: [VB] Trailer Mounts

I'll take a few pics, send 'em on over.  I had to have the trailer towed from San Jose to livermore after BYOB because it was really shaking around. I mean REALLY shaking around! I have since replaced the wheel bearings but I am at the end of my list of possible solutions. I thought maybe my bumper was flexing to much thus causing the shakes but I am still not sure. It (trailer) rocks left to right on occasion, not up and down. It's almost like the wheel isn't re-centering itself or the bearings were shot and allowing the wheel to pitch left to right.  Does your wheel look like it is cocked to one side? I straightened mine out as it was cocked to one side, maybe I shouldn't have? Also, do you level your trailers out? I do. The arms I have are straight as far as I can tell, I was even lucky enough to get two sets but one of them would only work with euro bumpers as they are wider. I had some U shaped brackets made for the mounting and they sit a little above center on the bumper, but I don't think that should make a difference.  Sean 65 Westfalia
