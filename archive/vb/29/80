Subject: RE: [VB] Personal lawsuit?

I think I have the dilly for this, an Ebay auction. "Bus is a wonderful
daily driver" "easily does 65-75 mph" "Complete with all original glass,
trim, trim rings...."
Many of you know about the ebay bus I got, a 1966 Lotus White (solid color)
DLX was a mess. The complete list of nightmares, shorted to preserve
bandwidth:
1) Broken Accel pump, wasted intake boots.
2) holey exhaust boxes, dented extractor (and blacked bumpers :) )
3) 2 percent leak down in cyl one, good thing, since all others were 40-60
percent! Motor wasted.
4) wrong gen fan, no tstat or flaps, proabbly why the motor was wasted.
5) rear brakes on upside down on wolfgang swingaxle conversion. Wrong
bearing spacers made for looose backing plates.
6) wasted brake hoses, and hoses entered front backing plates at bottom!
Very cracked close to rupturing.
7) rear axle nuts torqued to about 15 or 20 lbs.
8) no side mirror, non oe front windsheilds (obvious too), missing two 14
trim rings.
And he broke the center section of the most mint oG wheel I have ever seen.
Any body know how to fix jus that, this thing doesn even need paint!
 The scariest fact this dude swore I could have DROVE THIS HOME FROM OR IN
MARCH! I would have not made it far without alot of parts and luck.
Based on his text, and the fact he lives in OR, sueing might have been a
long hard road. I did recover 1500.00 from him, that was before I found the
trans to have a wiped input shaft bearing, and the above motor situation. A
7600 original cost down to 6100.00. I have spend about 5.5 K getting this
bus together mechanically. She is now unlowered, about to reciece rear
spring plates, trans and a new 1600 SP with a doghouse set up and all flaps.

Caveat Emptor! And make the best of what you get dealt.

On a good note, shes only got 33k OR miles, and I just managed to remove the
rear shift rod with one squirt of penetrating oil, a 8 mm wrench, and alot
of luck.... :)

Take a personal look at what you are going to buy IMHO..
L8r,
Al

 Could they???

I think they could, if they had in writing what the bus was supposed to be,
and clear representation documented that it was not (from mechanic or
bodyshop).  And quotes of how much it would cost to get the bus to the
sellers stated condition.

A few years ago someone I knew bought a split window rag top bug from out of
state.  Sight unseen.  It had been featured in one of the rags, the sellers
description and picture were great.    But innacurate.  Upon arrival, the
engine didn't run right, there was something wrong with the tranny (both
supposedly rebuilt).  supposedly  NOS parts were plastic repros (of
taillight
housings) or obviously aged pieces.

He was making a long list- pages - of what was not as described on the bug.
I am not sure where it progressed from there, but seeing as part of the
payment was due after he got the car, he did not send that part of the
payment.  I wondered when he was spending over 10K on a 'fully restored'
split bug why he didn't spend a few bucks and a weekend to fly and see it
first.  Also realise the mags will print what they are told about the
featured car.   The engine may be a POS under that shiny tin.  etc.  so what
if the slots in the engine tin screws all line up.

Whether they should depends on the amount spent and the amount needed to fix
what was misrepresented.
