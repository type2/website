Never put out more money than you are willing to loose.

I bought a bus a 1000 miles away last year and I flew in to pick it up and 
drive home.

The bus was in worse shape than described, but for only $980 and the fact 
that It was in good enough shape to drive 1000 miles, I was okay with the 
deal.

I had sent a deposit of a couple of hundred bucks and then spend another $160 
on the plane ticket.  It was round trip so I could have turned around and had 
only been out $360.

Now it sounds like in this case the new owner took delivery and the cash was 
paid.  There isn't much you can do other than try to work it out with the 
seller.  You could also get an appraisal which would help your case.  Either 
way it would be difficult and expensive to take legal action from across the 
county.

Lots of good ideas from other listees on how to prevent this before it 
happens.
