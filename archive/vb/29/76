Subject: Re: [VB] 40 HP re-visited

I do not call them 40hp or 1500 FWs, or describe them by year.  Not only am I 
not sure when they changed from stepped to  O ring, I dont think it was the 
same time as when they changed from 40hp to 1500.   Also, either kind of 
crank could be used for either kind of engine during a rebuild.   SO, compare 
the cranks in the 40hp and the 1500- are they both stepped?  you can use a 
stepped FW on a later crank, but you should not use an o ring FW on a stepped 
crank.  

the end of the crank has a 'step' on it, as does the FW (unless the fw has 
the o ring groove).   Yes the other kind will fit, check for the step.  

I think pictures are needed,

 Ok, so I finally get the flywhhel off of a 1500 engine I have (from a 64 
bus) and it fits fine on the 40 HP engine I have, there is no O-ring? on it.  
AM I WRONG?? The 1500 FW seems to fit the 40 HP fine.  I did look in the "How 
to re-build your VW Engine Book" and it seemed to say that 1500's up to '65 
had the same flywheel configuration as the 40 HP.  Can anyone definitively 
confirm or deny this??  
 BTW, There's too much good info on this list to let the butt-heads take 
over. All you TRUE Bus-heads please stay patient and the let the sh*t 
currently hitting the fan settle down before you leave forever, because I 
STILL NEED A LOT OF HELP WITH THIS ENGINE! ;-)
