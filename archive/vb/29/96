I made it back after another sudden dying of the truck.
My question is where does the windshield squirter go. Inside or outside the 
wiper shaft.
I have an older aftermarket set of squirters as well as the double hole 
squirters from Ronnie (-at-) Jerome.

Where does the squirter go and is the a service bulletin on that?
