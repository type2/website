Subject: Re: [VB] Dying at stop lights -me too.

Hi Wade,
  A couple of years ago, I had a 69 westy with a 1600 dp and 009 dist.
I had the same problem with it dying whenever I stopped. I checked 
everything I thought.  Someone suggested changing out the condenser.
I did, and it fixed it. Good luck,
Wayne
'67 kombi
