(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-) No wonder I bailed out...I must be in the wrong place.Not a 
word(or very few,none from David"He with the power to remove any from the 
list at his will"His words...besides calling us stupid.. was raised to kill 
this thread and the others knocking someone else on the list down when they 
try to voice their thoughts on friday.Think about that one gang...Most on 
the list are very good people...others that drop hate email(like the one at 
the top) then fade into the darkness only to wait for the next time to write 
and bash someone else they are the ones to be removed.Not those that hate 
what the terrorist have done.This is not my list I did not start it....The 
owner David? can make any rules he wants to and call you any names he wants 
to.If you play in his pool you got to swim in his piss....Not me.When he 
posted those two emails calling people names I had seen enough...Funny thing 
is all the people that email in and want us all to get along never sent a 
word in to say that he(David) is not right(well one) for him to call people 
names....Scared? Is it easier to run down those that want to see terrorist 
get payed back?......I am mad that is for sure.This is not my list so all I 
can do is leave.Just know I dont agree with David and the way he handles you 
all.There was no need for name calling not at a time like this.....I guess a 
person has to draw a line somewhere and I cant see staying with any owner of 
any list when he drops a couple of bombs like those two emails...Later 
days...Real Bus People..Mark and Ol' No Name......(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)
