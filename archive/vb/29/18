It's really hard to find a bus here in New England that hasn't experienced
the same winters and "Yankee ingenuity" that all of our houses, garages,
spouses, etc, have.  That said, When you're lucky enough to see that random
old bus just sitting there, neglected,  something gets in your head, and
that same "Yankee Ingenuity" kicks in, and says "Dog legs, who needs dog
legs? (Substitute rockers, floor pans, wheel wells, etc., etc., etc.)  I
bought my 71 two weeks after I got home from a cross country trip where I
saw some beautiful busses which were leading around equally intriguing
drivers/passengers.  The ad read 90% restored, running rough.  Well, it had
a broken crank, 50% of the body was magnetically challenged, but I towed it
home anyway, restored some of its dignity (thanks Maaco) and got it back on
the road, So now I'm getting into the nitty gritty of the 65.  You can only
get into it through the cargo area, as the drivers door is missing a hinge,
and the passenger floor is about to give at any minute.  In looking at the
ads for left coast busses on thesamba, I wince, and drool at what I could
have, but for now I'll keep chuggin' along with their beloved used and
abused cousins
