Nick--

You might also try checking out a couple of the bigger websites for
license plate collectors, such as the Auto License Plate Collectors
Assn. at http://www.alpca.com/ or Plates.com at http://www.pl8s.com/. 
These sites have links to personal webpages of plate collectors
nationwide, many of whom list license plate sets for sale.  A little
websurfing and a email or two might do it for you--let your fingers do
the walking when you get tired of searching the flea markets.

That's how I finally found a mint set of Virginia plates (still in
wrapper!) for my '67 DC.
