The VB list is spread so far and wide I can't imagine there being a bus that
is more than 100 miles from someone on the list.  I think most would be
happy to help a fellow VB listee out if they were willing to pop for gas a
bite to eat.  The $50 - $100 investment may save you thousands of dollars
and tons of heartache.
