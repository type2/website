It's 1:00 am, but to me it's still friday.  I have taught fifth grade for
ten years now, Tonight I went to the wake of a former student's father, who
passed away due to diabetes at the age of 47.  The first thing Mike(former
student 16 yrs young) said to me, was, "Where is your hippie van? Did you
drive it here?" (unfortunately I hadn't)  Then his brother said " He got
another one, Hey Mr J, did you get that one goin' yet?"  Both these kids
gave me the biggest waves when they would see me driving around town, and I
can only say that I can't wait to invite them both over to help me pull the
motor on the 65, and just get it goin again.
