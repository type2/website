Subject: new engine problems

    I just put a new engine in my '66' deluxe and I seem to have a
problem!!  It runs really good until it gets warmed up, then once it
does I have to have to pump the gas pedal when I shift the gears to keep
it from coughing and sputtering and dogging down. Can someone please
help me???

                                              Thanks, John!!
