Subject: Re: [VB] Personal lawsuit?

There are some things you can do before the fact to prevent the
disappointment but if you are talking after the fact I'm guessing a lawsuit
is the only way to go unless the seller will make it right.  If it is a
business I think web exposure does wonders.  There has been a significant
amount of traffic on this list about which engine and Trans builders not to
use.
