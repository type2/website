Subject: Re: [VB] Bye Friends!(long)

Now this just plain sucks,

I too have been on list list for 3 or 4 yrs. too.  VWHoward turned me on to it after buying my first bus from him.
I have made may good friends and met many good people because of this list.  It's kinda like a family to me.  i know I don't post much and lurk more than anything but I read the list everyday.  The list has taken quite a downturn well before 9/11.  It just doesn't perk me up to read this list as much lately.  
It really sucks to see people like Scott leaving because of this off-topic crap.  I have followed his DC since day one....hoping to go typeIV one day.

I know I too would hate to leave the list, cause basically, it has become a part of my day...hell, life even.  

Let's all just get back to the buses and stress that our new listees read the FAQ's and charter.  Stress the importance of the archives too, mucho mucho good stuff in there.  They're there for a reason.  I don't want to see any of these guys leave.  Everyone relax, have a beer and let this crap blow over.

Hell, I think I only saw a couple of Jerome reports!

Let's get back to buses and move on.  I hope Scott, rethinks before leaving, and anyone else thinking about leaving.  This list is a great thing...I have have seen it, and I know alot of you have too.

Lately it seems like I meet a new listee at every show I go to.  I hope to make a lot more new friends in addition to the ones I have due to this list.

Sorry guys, i think I'll go and cry in my pillow now....
