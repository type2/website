I recently moved to downtown Atlanta, living in a highrise.  I'm a very short
walk to a nearby MARTA rail station, and there's about a bazillion MARTA 
buses running around.  It's a big change from little Newnan where I came from,
and I mostly like it, except for a couple things: nowhere to work on my bus 
(it resides in an underground parking garage) and with all this MARTA crap
I don't drive it much.  In fact, today was the first time in about a month 
I started it up.

It was, uh, kinda hard to start.  Battery is still fine (3 year old Die Hard)
but the carb was bone dry.  Once it started it ran great, and I headed out
with no problems.  I was out getting groceries...navigating around Atlanta
when there is a big rally in Centennial Park (2001/09/11 related) _and_ the
GA Tech vs Clemson game was interesting.  Lots of really brave pedestrians.

I shouldn't leave the bus alone for longer than a month (there is a Peach State
Transporters meeting once a month!  ;-)) but I'm wondering if I need to change
maintenance habits now that I've gone from "drive daily" to "drive seldom"
mode.  I've seen ideas for really long duration storage, but should I do 
anything different for shorter periods like one month?

And BTW, I've been off the list for a while, but now I'm back since the 'net
connection is in place and all...good to be back, etc :-)

And, by golly, I've finally got the covered parking spot my bus deserves!
