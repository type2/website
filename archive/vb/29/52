Don't know if I got that right, been awhile since high school german.

Need suggestions of placement and location for the addition of a few gauges. 
  I am adding an oil temp and mini tach for sure, maybe a clock or another 
gauge.  These will be permanent and need to look good.  Anyone placed them 
in the vent plate?
