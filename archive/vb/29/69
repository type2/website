Something no one has mentioned about this problem is
that the idle jet (pilot jet) whether it's
electromagnetic or not, sometimes gets plugged by a
small piece of stuff.  Take it out and blow out the
jet w/ air.  Thanks to Jon Furst for the suggestion,
although I've seen it myself on more than one
occasion.

And remember, Jon is here waiting for Busses and
Balloons this coming weekend.  Come one, come all to
the best (and only) vintage bus show in New Mexico. 
Westfailure is already here (had lunch w/ Kyle and
Dede today) and we're just waiting for YOU to attend! 
Beat Ricky Fu for the long distance award.  He's
coming to Albuquerque from San Francisco.  Pmail me
for details.
