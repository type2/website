Bart,
I took the VDO black rubber 3 gauge mount, turned it over and them mitered it 
to attach to the panel over my head just above the windshield. I had removed 
the visor which had been broken, and I didn't really need any way because I 
am tall. I ran the wires behind the panel and down the A pillar to the dash 
area. I now have a Tach, oil pressure and oil temp gauges just above my 
vision, lighted for night time use. This location would be quite far from the 
visual field of a shorter person. I have a non stock seat (left over from a 
Porsche project) which makes me even taller. 
works for me.
