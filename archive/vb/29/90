I know of at least three examples of Mexican engines living happily in
buses, including my own.  To me, the low-compression Mexican engine seems
to be ideal for the application and I have no complaints.

The main problem in dual-port heads is cracking around the spark plug
holes.  The Mexican heads address this problem by going to long-reach
plugs which allows the metal to be thicker in this area.  I have no idea
if this will prevent cracking or not, but it's a step in the right
direction.

Other problems with dual-port installation is cracking of the cylinder tin
and leaks in the manifold boots.  My 30-year-old tin, once repaired by
brazing, has shown no further tendency to crack.  I still haven't come up
with a good solution for the intake manifold boot problem other than
renewing them every time it is convenient.  The "silicone" boots are
better, but they still crack.  You can change them with the engine in
place by removing the left manifold end piece.
