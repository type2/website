Subject: RE: Tires Question

Where is the best place to buy Kleber145r15 tires in California? I know
Coker tire is in TN and their the ones that make and sells them. My bus is
with out two tires and the weather is nice right now so I like to be out on
the road.


Thank you in advance for the tire info.

Eric
