Bart,
   My 3 guages are mounted on a plastic plate from a junkyard WC VW. It has 
a nice angled part at the top that I've temporarily mounted with a small 
clamp to the lower edge of the dashboard. It blocks some access to the 
tray, but it shields the radio from passenger window view. Someday I'll 
mount it to the bottom of the tray. VDO sells a rubber block type of mount, 
but the angles are wrong to flush mount to the vent plate or above the 
visor. I'd advise against cutting permanent holes in anything but the vent 
plate.
