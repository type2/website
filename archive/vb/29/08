Waaaahh!!!!!!!  I *WANT* it!!!! Soooooo bad!!!!  Can't afford it, would be
too terrified to ride it, but I do love the old Beemers.  I owned an R80
G/S (350 lb., 800cc dirt bike!!!!) and i did love that baby dearly, 'til I
parked it in the back of a Toyota :-( No injury, but I have not been on a
bike since.

So, Al!  Your secret is out!!!  It's not the reliability, it's not the
German engineering, what you love in a vehicle is the oil spots on the
driveway!!! :-)

Seriously, volks, Al has a garage to drool all over!  not just the buses,
but the bikes, the Porsches, that old truck down under the garage, the
tools.  I thought I had died and gone to heaven :-)
