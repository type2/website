Hi Scott,
I started on this list the same as you, in about April-May of this year.  I
found a bus to buy in June at the Classic, and I have been checking emails
out on this list since.

My Birthday was on September 11th also, only I am older than you.  I'm sorry
that now every year, my birthday, (and yours too), will fall on such a dark
day in our Country's history.

You know, it's a shame that you aren't sticking it out though.  Although I
have been a VW guy since the '60's, (got my first new VW in 1964), I find
that there is always something new to be learned.  I wise enough in my old
age to realize that I must always learn new things, especially about the
cars that I love so dearly.  Actually, owning at least one aircooled VW is
sorta a lifestyle.  It's much more than a hobby.  This is why I think it's
so sad that you and others are willing to throw in the towel simply because
there are some loudmouths on this site that don't know when to keep their
mouths closed.

How would it have been for you if some of the people that you had gotten
help, hints, or information from all of a sudden decided to just stop
subscribing, thereby not allowing the rest of us to take advantage of their
knowledge?  There is no reason why this site cannot still be a good
experience for you and the others who are fed up over the way the posts are
going.

I hope you, and all the others who are dropping off the list will
reconsider.  As I've said in posts in the past, in between being a VW guy,
my son and I built Chevy's.  I don't think there is any way that a list like
this could survive in the Muscle Car world.  Those guys are not willing to
share any information or give any help to the people who share their
interests.  They keep all of their sources for parts and information to
themselves.  This site, and others like it, are what separates us from the
Chevy guys.  I'm sure that those guys would put up with the occasional
Loudmouth Jerk, like we have on this site, for the opportunity to share
information.  Believe me, the Muscle Car guys will never spend weekends
camping with others who share the same interests.  So anyhow, I hope that
you will use your delete button dillegently, and stick around.

Thanks,
Ed Richardson
