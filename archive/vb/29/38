Subject: Goodbye from the backup site..Mark and Ol'No Name




(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-) I enjoyed this email very much..In any large group of people 
there are going to be "JTB's" and others like him who do post off topic or 
just plain mean attacks on other people here..just hate mail sent in to try 
and cause pain.I have email blocked those people a along time ago ...I dont 
even get their post back at my main site...But here at my backup site they 
still get thru and I have sent in my feelings about them.Time to unsubscribe 
this backup site with hopes that David R...will start to weed out those that 
send in hate mail..those that wait to bash good people.After David R's 
emails I cant stay on this list knowing he is at the top with his finger on 
the "Banned button"....Like I have said before I have enjoyed my visit for 
the most part but it is looking like some terrorist types(JTB among others) 
are lurking about this list just waiting to bash us over our heads.I wish 
most of you well and it's looking like you can take alot more #(-at-)$% than I 
can from "Those" people.....Later Real Bus People....Mark and Ol' No Name 
from the backup site......(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)
