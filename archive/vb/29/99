Subject: 1958 Pickup update

 Got down to the garage late this morning ( Hangover) . the goal today was
to see if motor would start/run. Finally got a 12 volt coil mounted around
11 am. Took a break and watched the NASCAR race. During crashes I jumped a
wire from starter and put in the 12 volt battery ( after unhooking the wires
to gen and reg).
During next crash ran gas line from fuel pump to a 2 gal gas can. Next
crash, hooked up starter jumper and poured gas down carb. Did not do
anything to motor except check oil. Next crash did remote starter and hand
pumped carb. Guess what!!! The damn thing started and after warm up ran
great. Purred like the old kitten. Lady said bus was running when parked and
it still runs. Did have an exhaust leak from muffler. Shut down and tried
again and it started again. No gas, no nothing. VW are great. Bus sat since
1965 and it started. Plug wires rotted and all. Accelerator pump leaks
alittle. If brakes were redone could drive it. Did the clutch thing and it
moved in all gears on the trailor. Looks like it has a new home already.
Going to a great bus guy who will leave it stock and drive it.

Cant wait for the next bus tip. See you all in Havasu in Jan. 2002
