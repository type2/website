Subject: Re: [VB] Corner windows from Brasil

 I have seen you message posted several times and no answer, so I will chime 
in.

where do you live?   I have not seen new brasilian corner windows available 
in the USA?   I believe they are the same as the ones for german buses.   I 
have only seen in person a few brasia buses- none in this country- really 
interesting chimera.   I would think that the brasiala bus rubber seals would 
work, and I would love to get some, to use on my 61 corner window bus.  as 
there are none available to me as far as I know, I cant get them, and I am 
hoping the brasilia ones have molded corners, like the original german seals. 
 Do they?   you sound like they are available to you.  Here you can get the 
seals from WCM or WW, and I dont know how good theyare, 

my 61 15 window still has 40 yo seals in the corners.

 Is the any one that can help me.  
 
 I just brought some corner windows that have VW Brasil
 written on the ID tag.  Will these fit a German Bus? 
 If you know some one that has a Brasilian bus could
 you please ask them if they need to get special rubber
 seals for them or if they just buy ones for a split
 screen.
 
 Thanks for your help
