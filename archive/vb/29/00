I just recieved this email (scroll below).  As you may know, I blasted all the hippy artwork from my bus, but any of you deadheads in CA that are interested can contact the guy below.  Who knows, maybe you'll make enough dough to buy a new bandana, Birkenstocks & some weed.  :-)  Good luck.

Hi! I'm from a television production company in Burbank, California, USA. We
really need a VW Microbus complete with psychedelic decor in San Francisco,
CA on October 12th. Any leads or help you can provide would be really
appreciated. Thanks!
