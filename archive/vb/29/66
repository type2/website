Subject: Re: Corner window rubber

Thanks for trying to help.  I guess I will have to
keep asking around.  As for corner window rubber that
is easy!  There are quite a few places that make them
the cheapest and best ones I thing you will find at
Wolsfburg West -

They have some very good stuff.  As for me I need all
the help I can get.  I am living in New Zealand and
down here there are only about half a dozen deluxe
split screens on the road.  I have been looking for
one for about two years.  I will succeed though even
if I have to convert a kombi (there are not many of
those either).  Have fun with your bus.  You don’t
know how lucky you are.

Thanks 
Derry
