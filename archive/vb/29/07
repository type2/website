Subject: Various Stuff

1. Daughter rebuilt 2 motors because she wanted to try it. Both still
running after tons of miles. From bare case up, only helped put rings on. 14
on first and around 16 on second.
2. Have a friend who wants to sell a near perfect 2/3 F/C middle seat.
Ivory/grey color.1 of the nicest I have ever seen. Wants far price, what is
a fair price?.
3. The 63 chop top single cab is still for sale. $750.00 OBO. See ad on
Everett site. $500.00 less trans and front seats, FOB LHC.
4. Zebra bus with Ronnies weird single port hotrod motor ran 48/50 sec miles
all the way to Jerome. Speedo only goes to 100 KPH, had it pegged past the
highbeam light. Sweet motor for whomever gets it.
5. The Rancho 3:88 trans was perfect and flawless the whole 700 mile trip.
All new r/b brgs, and was perfect, even with the weird early shift pattern,
call Ronnie for yours today.
6. Early buses keep popping up everywhere, keep your ears open and follow up
all leads no matter how weird they might seem. Leaving at 6 AM Sat.
7. The Jerome raffle bus was the GREATEST YET!!!!! ABC IS THE BEST!!!!
8. Still got the 56 splitcase r/b trans for sale. Email me, its drum to
drum.
9. Finally got the banned WalMart picture figured out. Gary are you ready
for it??? Thanks TT's for a great Sat. night, I think.
10. thats all/
