Hi Rex,
To remove the center section of the transaxle you will need to remove it axle 
to axle.

<<And as for my current transmission, I may look around and see if i 
can find a builder who can swap that syncro out so it won't grind 
going into second. There's supposed to be a guy a few hours from me 
that is great. >>

If a rebuilder has the tranny that far apart labor cost is going to be so 
high you might as well have it completely rebuilt properly.  At the same time 
you can have a differant R&P installed.
