I know that I won't convince you old school "weld it on or go home guys" ;-)
BUT,,,,,  they have been "gluing" windshields in for a long time,, works great,,
they can UNGLUE and put in a new one, entire roofs can be replaced by "gluing"
another over top...

On a Bus, there is at least one great application, The Battery tray that is
rusted out in the middle but not on the edges,,, Cut out what's left,, then
"glue" in a new one,, no repainting of the rear quarter! Strong like ox,, it
will even hold the battery in place through an accident!
Hey,, Do what makes you happy,,
