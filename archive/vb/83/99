Subject: Re: [VB] Shift rod help!

Hi TJ,
Glad we could help.  Hopefully you did not drill too deep and ruin the 
tapered hole in the shift linkage rod end for the tip of the couple bolt to 
seat into.  Also you did grease the coupler and end of the shift linkage rod 
to prevent rusting together again?  If not, it is worth it to take it apart 
again to do so!  It took two whole days for us to get out the rear shift rod 
from our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion.  Finally had to oxy/accel 
cut the forward solid shift coupler in half to remove the shift linkage rods. 
 Then go over to Clara's place to help cut up the forward remains of another 
60 panel for just the shift coupler stuck on the rear shift linkage rod.  
Once home with this rear shift linkage rod and forward coupling it took three 
hours of hard work to get them apart!
