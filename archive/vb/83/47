Subject: Help with KM speedo

Hi all,

I need a KM speedo for my early '59 euro deluxe (i.e. has semaphores).
Will somebody tell me if one of these speedos is correct.  Am I looking
for a clear needle KM speedo, or was the clear needle only used on MPH
speedos of this era

This one is supposed to be a 1961 T2 euro bus KM speedo:

This is supposed to be dated 12.59 and has Brown ring color:

The new show season is coming and I'm going to find the more difficult
pieces this year

Thanks all,
Aaron
