I'm pretty sure Bob didn't give someone at the Karadeniz Technical
University in Turkey permission to reprint his work.  This URL has
been floating around for a little while now.  Maybe the fact that
they didn't have permission from the copyright holder finally sunk
in to someone at that school.  For background, see
