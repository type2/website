Hi Joshua,
Check your clutch pedal play, it should be about 1/2" to 5/8".  When the gear 
oil is cold in the tranny the VW will tend to move forward when still in 
nuetral.  As for your gear shifting it sounds like you need to go through the 
shift linkage and then adjust the gear shift base if need be.  Make sure the 
frnt and rear shift couplers are bolted tight and safety wired in such a way 
as to keep tight the bolts not loosen them!  Then check for slop in the front 
shift linkage bushing and the condition of the rear coupler by having a 
helper move the gear shift while you are underneath the VW inspecting for 
looseness.  After all the above is done and you still have sloppy shifting 
you probably need to remove engine and tranny to install a new pair of rear 
linkage shift bushings.
