Well, sort of.  Depending on the year (late split, early split, and barn
door) they mount is various abet very similar places.  I only have personal
knowledge on the late split variety.  I believe thise fit 67 back to 58 or
so(Mine was made in 71' though).  When ever the pressed "U" shaped tranny
cradles took over from the tube type.

This type bolts in 9 different locations, although 4 bolts are in about the
same place. As mentioned the forward part mounts to the torsion tube on
both sides of the transmission (think tuning fork) with U-bolts.  Moving
back, there are 4 seperate points that get bolted to the tranny cradle (2
are inside the frame horns and 2 are in between the horns along the axis of
the cradle).  Next come what I call the "wings".  These mount to the rear
most bumper mounting bolt (with longer bolts).  They are curved and bolt to
the center of the hitch below the crank pully with 2 bolts per side. 
Finally, there is a 6" bar that attaches with 2 bolts to the underside of
the bumper blade (not really for strength) to keep the thing from banging
on the bumper.

In all, it is a VERY securly mounted device.  To pull it off you'd have to
rip the entire rear end out of a bus/truck.
