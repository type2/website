Hi Steve,
M 12 X 1.5 X 25.  Check out Time-sert for solid inserts, that are best for 
these.  Heli-coils really should be used only for emergency use and/or in 
places you plan never to take apart again!  Check the article below we wrote 
about using longer bolts for much more secure mounting of the RGBs.
