Hi TJ,
Would be nice to know if year your bus is(1950-67)!  ;-) The solid front coupler should have two square headed bolts (Same bolts as used in the rear flexable coupler.) safety wired securely so as to keep them tightened.  Sounds like these may have been sheared off by DPO and you will have to drill and/or dremil grind out what is left of these bolts.  Even then you probably will have to work the linkage rods and coupler apart due to rust.  Just remember that the linkage rods are hollow tube and crush easy!  So wrench only nearest the ends where the solid plug ends are welded in to the tube of the rod.
