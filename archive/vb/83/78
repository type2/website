Subject: VanBondo observation on a Friday night...

It has been a long time.... <that's another story> er, I mean, since I stepped
up and drew up a cartoon. Iffn I was to do another one it was inspired at last
weekend's Phoenix area "Copper State" Show, graciously hosted by the WolfsBERG
Registry.
My observation was that all of the vendors were standing around with their arms
folded across their chests not selling anything. In the background all of the
attendees were comparing baby strollers, progression of vocabulary development,
discussing the virtues of Pull-ups and whispering about what brand of "real"
car that they recently bought.
Y2K and everyone stayed home with the lights out... In my house "TypeII"
indicates that it's Daddy's turn to change the diaper. <sigh>
ROADTRIP! my evil twin keeps screaming "ROADTRIP and GENTLEMEN, DON'T FORGET TO
TIP YOUR HOSTESSES"
