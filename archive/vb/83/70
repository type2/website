Subject: Washer fluid operation


I'm trying to figure out where the one way valve is on my washer fluid 
bottle. When i push the button down air comes out of both holes on the back 
of the cap. It seems to me air(fluid) should only come out of one hole while 
the other sucks air(fluid) back in when the cap comes up. but maybe i'm 
wrong. Maybe the valve is suppose to be down in the pick up tube? well any 
help would be great
john
