Hi Naomi and Danny,
Best to not do that unless one or both of you are missing a functioning leg.  
You would have to convert to IRS suspension in the rear.  This would lower 
the rear about two inches so you would have to lower the front.  Then you 
will experience a loss of HP in a heavier VW so you would have to upgrade to 
a 1776cc or larger engine.  Lastly these trannies are getting real hard to 
rebuild due to lack of new and even used parts so when it goes bad you would 
have to convert back to a stickshift tranny!  While stickshift tranny is 
daunting to those who are used to automatic transmissions, the manual one 
gives you lots more response, control, less loss of HP and torque.
