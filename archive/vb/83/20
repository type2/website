Subject: (2) stashes gone....

One of the vw stashes I found a while back with about (8) old busses 
and tons of other VW's is most likely sold. I talked to the guy last 
week and he said there was a deal on the table for the lot. If it 
doesn't go through, he says I can come out and buy some stuff. Too 
bad. It was a good place. I'm afraid that the buyer might be a dune 
buggy builder. It'd be a shame if it turned out that way.

And the old VW dealership mechanic from teh 60's and 70's near me 
finally made a deal with a friend of mine to sell all his stuff. 
Only...he's keeping his "personal" tools. That means his killer Hazet 
tool cart and a bunch of really good VW tools. But...my friend is 
getting the rest. Lots of NOS VW parts...mostly repair parts. Not 
really any sheet metal or anything like that. My buddy is building 
shelves right now to store the stuff and I'm helping him retrieve and 
inventory it all next week. By helping him I'll be able to grab some 
stuff for myself. Hopefully there will be some stuff on there that 
will interest this list. If any old bus stuff turns up in it all, 
I'll  hit the list with it.

He's getting a line bore tool, some tranny tools including some jigs, 
and some other of the more serious VW tools. I'm glad he got the 
stuff 'cause he's really into vintage VW's and it'll all get used for 
a while. All the old VW guys around here are retired or retiring and 
we need someone who can pick up the reins and start doing some of 
that kind of stuff. I'll post next week as to the outcome on it all.

I will say that I'm seeing lots of the VW treasures around here 
starting to dry up. Seems the old guys are selling out cheap, and 
people are hunting more and more. I guess it's not really safe for me 
to "wait" to get stuff anymore. I find myself saying more and more 
"you snooze you loose".
