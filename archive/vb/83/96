My Double Cab needs a new tranny, and it appears that I have one here which 
may work, but I can't identify it.

Replacement tranny is 5-bolt, B, 113 301 103.
Original tired tranny is a 64 (mfg 6/63), 'big-nut' unit.

1.)  Can anybody identify this tranny, and gear ratios?  The only info that 
I can find is that the 'B' designates "fully synchronized" bus.

2.) What is the gear ratios of my current, tired tranny?

3.)  If the replacement tranny is a match, can I bolt up my "large" axles, 
etc, to it?

Any help would be appreciated, I have searched all my books and web, with 
no luck.... thanks in advance,
