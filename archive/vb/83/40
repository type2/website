Subject: Re: [VB] 5 speed

I don't know of one for the later buses; for earlier trans
case, there are a couple of '5-speed' conversion kits, but
from what I've heard, they're just hacks, not real 5 speeds.

There were billions (literally) of freeway miles driven before
you with the 4 speed - it should be OK.
