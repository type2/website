Hi John,
If you can not mount to the rear torsion bar tube, then U-bolting to the 
frame horns should do well.  Mounting to the torsion bar tube just inside the 
swing plates not only offers a stonger part of the body, but gives more side 
to side strength/control to the hitch due to being a much larger triangle 
shape to it.  Either way you might want to consider installing two U-bolts on 
either side since you are doing this modification.
