I don't really want to restart the 34 pict and 009 debate.  But I must say 
that every one who had compliants with the combination that I Have 
Personally seen were trying to make junkyard parts work.  Let's face there 
is a reason that the 009 is $50, it is cheaply made and they wear out after 
50K miles or so and the 34 pict is not a carb that rebuilds especially well.

I think that this an ACVW thing, try to make junkyard garbage work. I have 
lots of friends and family that run muscle cars,  and NONE of them ever try 
to make junkyard dizzys and carbs work. They go out and buy new ones,  and 
they are a hell of alot more expensive then our stuff,  I think that a new 
Edelbrock 600 is around $450.

I have a 34pict and 009 on a stock 1600 DP and I  don't have a flat spot 
once the engine has warmed up.

I am just making an observation,  I am by no means an experienced VW 
technician and I am not trying to discount others' experiences.
