Subject: Re: [VB] Corona de Tucson

The Corona de Tucson event is a sort of a "mini-Jerome" type campout behind 
an American Legion post.  It's a small and very laid-back event and in the 
past years there has always been plenty of room.  Someone making the trip in 
an RV probably won't want to park directly with the VW's mainly because you 
have to cross a wash that might give you a problem.  On the other hand, the 
AL post has a very large gravel parking lot just before the wash that a few 
RV's could use and still be close enough to the VW camping areas to leasily 
be considered participants.  In fact, as I recal, there are usually a couple 
of buses that camp here anyway.  Naturally, we would like to see as many 
buses an can make it, but if it can't be, then it can't be.  Please come 
anyway.  We would be happy to meet as many of our out-of-state VW friends as 
possible!!
