So what I've seen of Westy tow hitches on Thom's and Everett's sites they
connect to the frame horns and to the torsion bar with U bolts correct?
I have a single wheel trailer I'm going to try to set up and using the
bumper brackets is way too flimsy.  It looks like a westy hitch type
configuration, then to a heavy duty bumper with heavy bumper brackets
would be the way to go?  Any suggestions would be welcome before I go to a
welder.
Thanks,
