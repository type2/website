Subject: Re: [VB] door removal




For removing those big screws on the door hinges you need a size #4
phillips screwdriver, a #3 won't get a good enough bite. I use a
craftsman industrial #4 screwdriver ( tool #47438 ) it's got big super
grippy handle and flat sided shank. A 3/8" boxed end wrench will fit
perfectly around the flat sides and doubles your torque. You can lean all
your body weight into the screwdriver and turn the 3/8" wrench at the
same time. This has worked for me sometimes better than an impact
screwdriver.
