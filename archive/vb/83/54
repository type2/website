Subject: Local Shop?


My daughter has my VW in Southern California right now, Encinitas to be 
exact, and the brakes need adjusting/bleeding.  I won't be able to get down 
there so although this rubs the fur the wrong way.... can anyone local to 
the area recommend someone close to Encintas where she can have this done by 
someone reputable?  She also has a small electrical problem to ask about... 
probably the switch.  Please... I hate others touching my cars so only 
highly recommended shops please... oh yeah, she works in Rancho Bernardo so 
a shop over there might work out for her also.  Thanks for any info you can 
share.
