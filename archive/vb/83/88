Could someone tell me how to get the front shift rod out? It seems there
is a coupler right before it goes into the long tube to the back but I
can't see a way to disconnect it. The PO did a nice job of welding a U
bolt to the original front rod bushing holder so as to do away with the
real bushing. I have a new holder with a bushing from Ronnie but Im not
sure how to get it on which lead me to removing the front shift rod. Any
tips greatly appreciated!!!!
