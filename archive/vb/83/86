Subject: Re: [VB] Washer fluid operation

I had the same problem with my washer bottle. The check valve was dead.
When I put my nice new WW rubber cap on the bottle I had to pump like
hell to get any fluid on the window because the fluid in the lines would
suck back when the cap was refilling. I happened to have an electric
pump with a check valve from some unknown car that I had planned to use
to motorize my washer bottle. I took the check valve off the electric
pump and mounted in the hose leading to the nozzles. I put mine inside
the washer bottle so it's completely hidden from view. You could put it
anywhere in the tube, though.

The original check valve is in the hard plastic part of the cap that the
rubber button mounts on.

You can probably get a check valve off almost any car in the junkyard.

Hope that helps.
