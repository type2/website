whats goin on is the nut inside the body is turning.

your rite about that. Fresh paint, will need to fix

a different way.

first screw hole where hinge fits on (drivers side)

itlooks like you can get to it by cutting it from the 

inside, back seat is out, with the gas tank there,
would 

it be safe to do it this way?

the other (jamnut) is that the correct term? is also
on the drivers side, but for the rear hinge.

more difficult to access with engine in place. 

Yea, i know take out the engine.

thanks to all!

the engine
