Subject: RE: [VB] Can gas leak from an idle cut off solenoid?

I had several bad idle cut-off solenoids, the plastict centers get whacked
when removing carbs of installing other stuff. Usually a good idea to
replace them if they have been stuck in the side of a carb that gets tossed
around on the bench before puuting back in. I usually pull them out of the
carb before putting the car on the bench, one less thing to bother about
when I put everything back together.

Before this loosey thing gets telfon tape or a drop of loctite, can this
be a source of gas dripping when stopped?
