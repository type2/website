Subject: Re: [VB] carbs

SHEESH!

I didn't mean to start crap.

All I said was that I cannot get the 34 pict to run right.  Now I did not
say that ALL 34 pict carbs suck.  I just have no luck tuning or fixing them.
This is me, I have NEVER claimed to be a carb expert.  If I can't put a $15
rebuild kit on em and they run, then I shuck it.  I know just enough about
carbs to get myself into trouble and that's about it.  So, if you can get a
dual 34 setup to run, that would be great, and please share the wealth, and
maybe do a tech article on how to get the little gremlins to run right
(either single or dual!), I guarantee that I would read it.

Later
