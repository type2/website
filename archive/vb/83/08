Subject: door removal

Well I am almost ready to start the body work on my 1960 camper. The only 
thing left to do is take the doors off. I have tried to remove the pins in 
the hinges and tried to loosen the big screws with an impact driver. I can 
not get anything to move. How can I get these doors off?
