Subject: RE: [VB] Steering Box Adjustment

check the condition of the ends of the draglink. then check the centerpin
for worn bushings. then check king pins for play. then check link pins and
adjust if necessary. then check tie rod ends. then check steering box. do
in that order. granted there are more details involved, but those would be
good places to start. loose wheel bearings? bad tires? bad or missing
steering damper?
