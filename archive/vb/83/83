Hi Sam,
Aluminum will crack easier due to flexing than steel of the same thickness.  
The original tubing was steel with copper plating.  The grommets we could 
find were too soft and two weeks later were cut through.  Will check out Ace 
for ones hopefully made of stiffer rubber.  Thanks Everret!  Wolfsburg West 
has the grommet and steel fuel line listed for 40 HP and later engines, but 
both are out of stock right now.
