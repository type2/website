As far as I know, this is true.  Bob did do a CD-ROM of his Sermons
that was sold for a while, but it is no longer available.  Bob took
the Sermons off his web site, and I believe he has asked people who
were mirroring his site without permission to take down their copies
as well.

PS: For anyone who may be wondering what this is all about: Bob Hoover
is a long-time VW guy who wrote several good articles about VW repair
and maintenance and trips he took.  They came to be called his "sermons".
He published them on the Web and on CD-ROM for a while, but because
of many and varied hassles, he is no longer publishing them.
