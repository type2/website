 Hi Sam,
 Aluminum will crack easier due to flexing than steel of the same thickness.  
 The original tubing was steel with copper plating.  The grommets we could 
 find were too soft and two weeks later were cut through.  Will check out Ace 
 for ones hopefully made of stiffer rubber.  Thanks Everret!  Wolfsburg West 
 has the grommet and steel fuel line listed for 40 HP and later engines, but 
 both are out of stock right now.

Thanks.
I thought that the aluminium or copper tubing available in the hardware store 
was not correct. Clara's idea of taking a piece of hose, slitting the edge 
seems to work for the grommet but it is very tough to get inserted into the 
hole from the back.
I truly will try to get the correct fuel line before the temporary fix breaks!
BTW Peninsular Auto was also just out of the steel fuel pipe.
