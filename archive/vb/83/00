Hi Ray,
No, but we have found an advertisement from the early 60s for a kit that 
mounted dual 36 HP carbs on a 40 HP engine.  Plus VW did mount dual carbs on 
the type 3s in the mid 60s on the 1500cc.  
  As for wether it will work well is another good question, and would greatly 
depend on the size of the engine.   The type 3 1500cc engine used dual carbs 
the venturis in them that were smaller than the ones used in type 1 1500cc 
single carburetored engines.  23.5mm Vs. 24mm which kept the torque and HP 
output down in stocker range.  Going by our "Without Guesswork" for 1971-73 
the dual carburetors used in early 1700cc type 4 buses had venturis the same 
size (26mm) as used in the 34PICT-3.  So our best guess would be to use two 
34PICT-3s one would need a 1700cc or larger engine.  Unless you are just 
looking for drag racing with lousey low RPM HP and torque results.
  It would be easy to make a set of intakes out of a SP manifold and try out 
36 HP through the late 1600cc SP carburetors.  To really get the 34PICT-3 to 
work in a dual carb setup one would have to use DP heads and modified DP 
intake manifold to get any amount of increased performance than just using 
any of the previously made VW carbs.
