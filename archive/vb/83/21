Subject: wheel flares

ANybody got a set of the bus fiberglass wheel well flares that you 
saw a lot of in the 70's? You know, the ones they cut the rear wheel 
wells out for! I need the ones for the front AND the rear wheels. I 
don't want to pay a ton. I've got a bus here with the cut already 
there and the screw holes in the metal at the rear and the front. I 
had thought about restoring, but with the bajas being so poplular 
here, I though I'd put the flares back on and some big ol 
wheels...kind of a redneck baja bus.

If you got some you pulled off, or need to pull of, or 
whatever...email me and lets talk.
