Hi all

We are renovating a 1959 split-bus and we would like to put an automatic =
transmission of a beetle into the bus because I have still one in my =
storage....
Somebody has some experience in that? Is the size and fittings of the =
automatic transmission same as a manual transmission? Thank you for your =
help.

Air cooled greetings from Switzerland
