socket that attaches to a =BD" ratchet. You can lean into the ratchet =
while attempting to unscrew the bolt- a lot more effective than just a =
screwdriver. Rust doesn't stand up well to vibration so it is a good aidea =
to tap the bolt a good 30 0r 40 times with a hammer in an effort to break =
the rust before attempting to unbolt. I am sure there is something in the =
archives that is more eloquent than this.
