Hi Mark,
Problem is that unless you have all the paper work and complete logbooks to 
the trannies you mention they probably have been rebuilt/repaired.  Our 1960 
walk thru panel camper conversion came with a small nut tranny which would 
have been correct for the bus, but only got to 35 MPH (-at-) 3,000 RPM in fourth 
gear.  Probably the reason the DP engine that came with this panel had a rod 
sticking out the top!
  So best you can do is to check the ratios of the trannies you have by 
following the proceedure in the archives that John of Greensboro NC wrote:

or just avoid all the hassle of checking, installing and still finding the 
other tranny pops out of gear by just having one or both rebuilt to the 
gearing you desire and reliability!
