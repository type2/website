Mechanical throttle linkages are _so_ 20th century.  Toss the linkage 
and do throttle-by-wire; put stepper motors or synchros on each carb
and put a pot on the throttle pedal.  For safety, you have to make
sure that on failure, the throttles go closed rather than open.  The
cheap way is to put a big spring on the throttle that is strong
enough to close the throttle if power is cut to the actuator.  The
expensive way is to get the software and hardware of your entire
throttle system certified to aviation spec.  This is doable, but by
the time you are done, you could have bought three Buses and a
garage for them (with attached house) with the same money.

Of course all this stuff is not "vintage" but a 1776 isn't really
"vintage" either.  It might be a fun project, though.  I know Ray
might know one or two places where one can get powerful yet light-weight
stepper motors and synchros.  The only problem with those actuators
is that you might have to install 3.67 or 1.33 more batteries in
the Bus to get them to work.
