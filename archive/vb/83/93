The bus is a 65 DC, sorry for the poor pre-info :) I found the nub that
the DPO left me where the bolt should have been. I drilled it out and
worked it for about an hour and it came loose. Stuff like this is par
for the course with this bus. You should see the "custom" u-bolt that
was welded to the bushing carrier to hold the front shift rod up. All is
back in place now and the shifter feels really good! Thanks for the
quick reply!!!

Hi TJ,
Would be nice to know if year your bus is(1950-67)!  ;-) The solid front
coupler should have two square headed bolts (Same bolts as used in the
rear flexable coupler.) safety wired securely so as to keep them
tightened.  Sounds like these may have been sheared off by DPO and you
will have to drill and/or dremil grind out what is left of these bolts.
Even then you probably will have to work the linkage rods and coupler
apart due to rust.  Just remember that the linkage rods are hollow tube
and crush easy!  So wrench only nearest the ends where the solid plug
ends are welded in to the tube of the rod.
