I have seen many different variations on duel solex set-ups from bay window
to early Okrasa and others. There are a few tricks to make them work and it
can be done. SCAT makes a steering carb linkage that could be used, and
equalizer tube between the manifolds will help , the hardest part I can see
is finding the correct air correction and emulsion tube.

Ronnie Go for it ray

pa. At 1 time Danny Zapada (I think it was him) was selling duel solex
manifolds he was having made. Look in the achieves on Everetts page

You know, I keep hearing talk about defunct 34-PICT carbs or not getting
them to run right, but in my 25 years of VW work I have only run into a few
really bad carbs that couldn't be fixed. I used to have throttle shaft seal
problems with the old 28 and when the new 28 came along in quantity I
thought that was great. Then the 30/31 and the years of whining about them,
but I had no real problems with them either. Then when carb manufacture was
split between Germany and Brazil the arguments started up again. Still, I
found nothing that wasn't repairable. When the 34-pict came out I thought I
was in heaven, very expensive heaven, but heaven nonetheless. Now that 34's
are cheaper and more plentiful, either German or Brazillian, it gave me
pause to think of different uses for them. This whole .009/34-PICT thing
really annoys me. Sure, .009 are cheap, now, but they never used to be. And
my several 15 year old .009's are still running just fine, thank you very
much. Even my 20 year old .010's are in great shape, one destined for my SC
when I put the rebuilt stock 1500 back in. I believe that carefull attention
to detail prevents a lot of complaining later on. I will still research the
dual 34 issue, but I guess I am on my own on this one. I will let you know
how it turned out. If it was ok for Dell to put out their baby 34's then why
not a slight substitute?

I can't get ONE 34pict to run right. Why would you want 2 of em, that's
crazy talk!!!

LOL, really though, I've never been able to keep a 34pict running without
getting a flat spot, and is greatly exaggerated when running the 009 I find.

Just my 2 cents :)

Later
