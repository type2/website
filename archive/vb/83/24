I had the same problem. I found that the sheetmetal was flexing so much with
the impact driver that very little energy went into the Phillips head bolt.
The solution I used was to remove the Phillips driver and 1/2" adapter from
the impact handle. I then attached it to a 1/2" breaker bar. I then applied
careful torque to loosen the bolt. I know that this sounds illogical that a
breaker bar would work while the impact driver would not, but it did work.
Of course you must be extremely careful not to strip out the Phillips head.
Also the selection of the proper Phillips driver is very important.
