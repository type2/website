RVs on the non gultch side? Well sign me up! I will meet cha there as long as
you don't drown us out with generator all f'ing night. =) We old water pumper
ducks will stick together closer to the main road and the last Good Sam's camp
ground. God willin and as long as the ol lady can hold her lunch down we will
be there this time. I'll be parked next to you in the Eurovan "RV".
