Subject: oil change

long overdue oil change-
how much oil do i put back into my 1600 cc engine after i drain it-and what 
kind of filter is it? its a '67 bus. can i find the filter at a regular 
parts store usually? is 10-30 a good decision for an oil weight?i know these 
are really elementary questions, but i have to start somewhere-
thanks-
thomas
