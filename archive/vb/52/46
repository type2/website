The changes have been in the furnace design, not the
PVC.  Even boiling water can deform PVC--I have
witnessed kitchen drain problems where a kettle of
boiling pasta water was dumped in the sink, and
actually softened the PVC closest to the sink.
The newer high efficiency furnaces and gas water
heaters have exhaust gas temps that are barely warm.
