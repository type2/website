Hi Chuck,

I tried to send this to you in a p-mail, but I kept getting a "user unknown"
message.
Rocky Mountain Motorworks sells them - www.motorworks.com
Energy One sells them - http://www.energyonemfg.com/engstrt.htm
And most importantly, I sell them :)
If you're interested, I'll check my price tomorrow.  I'm pretty sure I can
beat both the other guys on price.

Later,
Matt Montgomery
