"I have an 8 foot garage door entrance, no power opener."
If you mean 8 foot tall opening, then no problem.  We have a stock height
1959 panel, when we had s "stock" repro rack we just cleared 6 feet 10 and a
half inches. We have a seven foot tall roll up door with a 3/4 inch floor
step up)  Now we did have the rack made one inch shorter (not the legs) thus
we have an inch to spare for life's little changes.
