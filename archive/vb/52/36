This thing has been all over the east coast a couple times now from
Carolinas to Key West to Canada to the Midwest and Back.

I suggest if anyone still cares about it that you box it up and ship it
out west to Ariz or Cali. Unless we are lucky enought to get one of the
oft-long distance guys from NEATO to take it out there.
