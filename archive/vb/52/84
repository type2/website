The 1971 bus is beginning to look like a bus again.  The engine had a lotta 
problems.
All are fixed, now. Still to go are the motor mounts and the engine shims. 
Finally found out that the 1600 engine has a rubber O-ring on the crankshaft. 
The O-ring is best, followed by the metal plate, and then by the paper 
gasket. If one has the O-ring,
he needs to leave out the metal plate and the paper gasket. The 1966? Ghia 
doesn't have an O-ring and therefore preferably uses the plate. The paper 
gasket is the last resort, and I dunno why it is still used. Anyhow, the 
O-ring is present on all 1600 engines, and therefore should always be used 
(that's what I'm told anyhow).

Well, three shims totaling 0.72 mm thickness (24 mm each) didn't give enough 
end play. So, I had Lee Roy at Knight's Foreign Auto Parts machine the 
flywheel again so as to get it right. The case, as it turns out, was a 
Mexican case. This bothers me, because that's twice in two trials that I've 
ended up machining the flywheel. I'm gonna check it out tomorrow before we 
finally get the end play right. We have one extra non-machined flywheel, just 
in case. This time I'm gonna do everything myself, just to make sure.

This morning, I got a 1964 adapter from Southern Cal Auto Parts for my 1964 
Type 34. Installed the new, leather steering wheel. It fit perfectly, so I'm 
home free on the steering wheels -  a Porsche 928 wheel for my Super Beetle 
and a "made in Brazil" leather one for my Type 34.

Then, I found some blue PVC hose to use as the fresh air hose on my 1974 
Super Beetle. I'm gonna take Scott with me tomorrow to have a look at it. I'm 
already getting
flack from Scott about the blue vacuum hose I bought, because it's so much 
trouble to install.

I had a trailer hitch installed on my 1999 New Beetle. It's good for a hitch 
weight of 
2000 lb. and a tongue weight of 200 lb. The Humbler weighs about 1500 lb. and 
we're gonna tow it via a tow-bar, where the hitch weight (horizontal) is 1500 
lb. and tongue weight (up and down) is essentially zero. If we used a 2000 lb 
trailer, we'd haft have 3500 lb. hitch weight rating and maybe a 200-400 lb. 
tongue weight rating. I bought a safety cable that latches onto the hitch, 
just in case.
