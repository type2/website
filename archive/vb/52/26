Hi Ric,
It would be nice to know at what RPM it is vibrating.
Any paid seperate balancing will probably still mean some out of balance left 
not a perfect to infinity job.  Probably best to mark you pressure plate and 
rotate it one bolt in relation to the FW.  Then drive it around to see how it 
does.  Keep trying this procedure over and over till you solve the vibration 
or have returned to just before the first bolted in postion.  If the 
vibration is still a problem remove the FW, replace gasket and/or O-ring and 
rotate it 1/4 turn.  Try this and if the vibration does not go away try 
rotating the pressure plate bolt by bolt again.  What you are trying to do is 
to see in each postion where you can get rid of all of the vibration.
  Do not laugh!  Even on a non-CW cranked engine it can make a big differance 
in how smooth the engine is and thusly how noisy or quiet the VW is just by 
the position of the pressure plate in relation to the FW!
