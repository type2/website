Subject: overseas transprt??? there's a free, abandoned bus!

I'm studying for a semester in Florence, Italy. There
is a 64 Kombi, right side drive, green on green,
hard-top camper in above average condition abandoned
on a street near me. I saw the owner come into the
city a coule months ago, seemed to drive well (the
bus), and pull the tags off. Under Italian law after a
given amount of time (that has already passed) you may
claim abandoned vehicles at no cost (none!!) I return
to Annapolis, Md. in about three weeks...I like
free...does anyone know approximately how about much
shipping costs would be, where I can find that out,
and/if there are any laws pertaining to both a
"claimed" vehicle and a right-side drive vehicle
entering the United States?? Any info you have would
be great! thanks, J.D.Wilson
