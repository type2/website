Subject: Westy Tow Hitch Questions, Electrical

Can anyone help me figure out some info about the
electrical hook-up box found on Westy tow hitches?

Did all hitches come with an electrical box?
Was the box a westy item or a "dealer" installed item?
What should the box look like?  Plastic or metal?
Where did the wires join to the bus's harness?

Anyone have just the electrical piece for sale?

Thanks for the help.
Matthew
