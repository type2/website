Well Full Moon Bus Club went camping again this weekend.  Glorious Full Moon.  This time it
was in N Florida at Stephen Foster Folk Culture State Park.  Beautiful Park right on the
Suwannee River. For pics go to

And as a side note you can see how I dressed SnoopyBus up for Xmas this year.  Lights and
all.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy

If you are going to walk on thin ice,
you may as well Dance...
