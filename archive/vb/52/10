Hi Kelly
It would sure be nice to see the Hub Cap and trunk make its way out here to 
the West and on to the West Coast... all off us are getting jealous of all 
you folks back east seeing and enjoying the Famous Hub Cap.

Having said that, none of my busses will make the run all the way to your 
shop, so just wishing that somebody will remember us out this way.... and 
then on to Europe/Oz/and all the rest of the world represented on these lists.
