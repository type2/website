Subject: Time to start replacing glass seals

... which means it is time to spaz (again) because it is something Ive never
done before <g>

I got my replacement seals today for the windshields and rear window.  I
save old messages so I did a search for 'windshield' thinking there would be
some pointers or links on how to best do this.  Unfortunately, all I could
find were stories that started with 'I was blah, blah, blah, and all of a
sudden I heard a crack'.  No comfort there (heavy sigh).

Anybody out there have some positive experiences and/or links they can share
or point me to??

I also have a situation where there are two spots where the windshield leaks
the most (on the bottom just to the left and right of the speedo).  There
appears to be rust there, the extent of which I wont be able to determne
until after I get the seal and the window out.  At the very least I am going
to have to clean it up and primer/paint it before I put the
windshield/gasket back in.

How forgiving is the gasket in filling these kind of areas if there is only
minimal decay (it came from WCM).  If I have to put some filler in there,
what would be the recommendation of the group.  Bear in mind I am anything
but a welder, and whatever I use will probably need to be something that
comes out of a tube.

Thanks one again for your collective wisdom
