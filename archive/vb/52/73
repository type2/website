Thomas,

I have a 1600 SP in my bus.  It takes just under three quarts to fill it on 
oil changes.  As to the weight oil to use, Ronnie posted a link to an 
excellent article about 2 weeks ago.  I printed out the article, but now I 
don't have the link to give you.  It was on the web site for the Vintage 
Triumph Register and was written by Ed Hackett. Find the article and read it. 
 It will tell you everything you need to know about oil weight and grade 
selection for your use and climate.  Oil screens (filters) are readily 
available at local foreign parts stores around here (northeast).  Several of 
the vendors on the list also sell them.  Kit comes with two gaskets a new 
drain plug coper washer, and six little coper washers for the plate.  Use the 
new washers. Don't reinstall the old ones as they have already been 
"flattened".  Good luck.
