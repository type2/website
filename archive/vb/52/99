Al-
Plug the jets in and try it? I think you want to keep trying smaller
and smaller jets until you go too small (engine "spits" because it
isn't getting enough gas) and then go back up to the next larger size.
Probably the answer is trial and error, I don't think you can count on
the jet sizes that work in someone else's engine to work the same with
yours. I would try a 60 pilot first, if that still runs good then try
the 55. But check the stroke of your fuel pump first if you haven't, I
think too high fuel pressure can make the engine run rich despite
correct jetting. If you are having problems finding mains or pilot/aux
jets I can mail some to you, $2.50 each at the bugshop. They have
mains from 112.5 up to something huge like 180, pilot/aux from 45 to
65 in 5's. No air corrects/emulsions, but I am not that far into the
process.
Good luck,
Joel

Joel and listees,
All I have found so far is 115, 120s, 55 pilot...Do you think I could
go
with a 55 pilot, 50 aux, and 120 main? My plugs are brown at the
electrode area, slight black at the thread edges, I am close to begin
with, and these plugs got fux0red when I first ran the engine with the
old carb from hell. This week end wil see new plugs to diagnose
better,
but I am thinking just the pilot reduced might be fine for me....
Is a 120main 55 pilot (instead of 65) and  50 aux a possible
combination?>
Still learning,
AL
