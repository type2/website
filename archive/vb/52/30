Hi Craig,
First replace the 20-50 Wt. oil with either 30 or perhaps 10/30 Wt. for the 
cold weather especially below 50F.  We tried 20-50 Wt. Castrol oil and found 
it acted more like 40 Wt. in the dual relief engines!  Are you running a 
thermostatic flaps system?  If not get one.  Check the 1968-71 bus Official 
Service manual for proper relief springs length for your year late model 
engine.    Eric&Barb
