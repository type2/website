Subject: Re: [VB] Mikuni --> Solex jets

Al-
I got genuine Solex main and pilot jets at my not-quite-local bug
shop, maybe $2.50/each. No air correction jet / emulsion tubes,
though.
I rebuilt my H30/31 and put in a 115 mains (down from 120 where it ran
rich), left pilot(65), aux(50) and air correct(125) as they were, I'll
take it for a spin tomorrow and report on what the plugs look like
afterwards.
No jet gauge, so I can't be sure of true size, but the 115 is visibly
larger than the 112.5 and smaller than the 117.5, I'll give it te
benefit of the doubt.
Good luck,
Joel

Please refer to the above link. Are the large hex the correct jets to
retro fit to Solex?

Is the VM22/210  the pilot jet to retrofit to Solex.

This is for that Brosol 30/31.

Thanks,
AL
