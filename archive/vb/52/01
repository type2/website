Subject: [VB] Mikuni --> Solex jets

I thought the Mukuni jets were only swapable for the main jet, not the pilot
jet.

I took my old main jet with me so that I knew what I was after.  I cannot
tell from the webpage what size to get.

The jets should be available locally at any full service motorcycle shop.  I
think mine cost $2.50 for a 132.5 main.  Which is too rich now with a stock
cam, need to try and lean out the carb.


Good Luck,
