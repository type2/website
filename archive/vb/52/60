Subject: ADMIN: After a brief delay..we're up again.


Thanks again to the great guys at Atlasta.net...we're up.  5 month old
power supply appears to have failed....at least, the +5v leads were not
putting out.

We're currently running again on a borrowed fullsize powersupply until I
can see if the vendor will replace this under the warranty.  I'm emailing
them as we speak, and will be calling them asap tomorrow.

sorry about that.

...david
