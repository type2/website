Bus is up and running again, as good if not better than she was. I
think some of the rich running problem may have been fuel pump
related, max stroke was 14mm, I shimmed it back down to 13mm with a
big stack of gaskets. Should have done that first. 115 mains was a
bust, ran but spitted like it was way lean, all the way from idle to
wide open. I replaced mains with a 117.5, surprisingly easy with carb
in place, and all seems well. I've only put a dozen miles on it since,
I'll drive into Sacramento tomorrow (another 40+ miles round trip) and
pull the sparkers for a look after that.
Does anyone know if the 1mm washer/shim is the right one to use under
the float needle valve for this carb?
I also patched up the cracking windshield seals with some roofing
cement, no more water running down the dash and soaking my left knee
when it rains. That is real progress!
Glad you all are back, try to stay warm.

Ps. Almost totally bus unrelated, except I will use the bus to get to
the trailhead, but are any of you hikers who may have experience using
one of the gore-tex bivy sacks? I am looking at the Outdoor Research
Bivy, but balking at the $250 sticker. Worth it, or just suck it up
under a tarp and count the money I've saved? Royal Arch route Grand
Canyon, ten days, early January, is the issue. Not enough flat space
for a tent, fair chance of rain and flash floods, down bag useless
when wet...
