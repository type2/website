Subject: Early 60's bus travelling on the Trans-Canada

Hi all,

Anybody know who is driving a 50s/60s sand/green splittie with a Westfalia
roof rack across Canada lately. Spotted at 2 pm +/- on the Trans Canada
Highway just west of
Austin, Manitoba. Thought my eyesight had failed, as it's been too many
years
since I have seen one actually on the highway up here. Hope they have a
gas heater in that thing today.....

Scott
'67 Westy

........... Yes , we do live in a Pre- '68 Type 2 culturally deprived spot
of the world here.....
