Another listmember made a good point which I suppose should be mentioned to
all.  When an item is put on sale, it goes on the Bargains Page on the
website. However, it also remains on the appropriate "regular" page (i.e.
brakes, clutch, etc.). Either way, it prompts the correct sale price.  But
if you happened to find it on a "regular" page, you might not know that it
was a sale item. He has a good point, and within a few weeks I'll try to
remedy that flaw.

Meanwhile, you can go to the Bargains Page before checking out, to see if
anything you picked is on it (therefore qualifying for 5% off instead of 15%
tomorrow, and no listmember discount the rest of the year). If you don't
want it you can always remove it from your shopping cart. But then again,
since most of those items are already marked down by 20-40%, you may not
want to.
