Subject: Jack point repair

The PO of my 67 kombi did a terrible job fixing what I assume was caused by
an incorrect jack usage in the rear right jack point.

I need advices on how to repair this. 
Should I rotate the jack point clockwise using force? Should I replace that
section? How about the metal sheet?
Any input would be appreciated.

Thanks
