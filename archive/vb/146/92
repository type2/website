Subject: POR-15 Advice Needed

Hey all,

I've got some POR-15 on its way to me.  I have some rust up along my 
gutters that I want to attack before fall and winter set in.  My plans are 
to clean the area, grind it all down to metal, then apply the POR-15 to the 
specific areas.  The whole roof doesn't need it, so I'm planning to lay 
down some primer over it...should I grind the whole roof down to bare metal 
before primering...or can I primer over the old paint and the POR-15'd 
parts, too?

-Taylor
