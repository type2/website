An all too familiar story. Whats with the wax?

| OK, I wasn't going to share this tale of woe, but your success compels me
| ; ). Caution, not for faint of heart. The frankenmotor for my '68 was
almost
| done,new p&c's, heads rebuilt, had just finished setting the valves and
was
| looking forward to quickly finishing off the rest. All that remained was
to
| change out one too short exhaust stud. Not a problem I thought, the rest
| came out with heat and wax real easy. Heated it up,added wax, attached
stud
| puller, added light pressure, snap, *&%$(-at-). Enough stud left to pull with
| vice grips. re-heated, re-waxed, set vice-grip, snap, now broken flush
with
| head. Double *&%(-at-). Put tools away.
