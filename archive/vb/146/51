Subject: FW: [VB] Jack point repair

Ricardo,

1) Stick a piece of strong iron (like a crow bar) in the jack hole and use a
hammer on the iron to bang the hole back to where it should be.
2) Remove the inside panel and use a ball peen hammer and tap out the body
steel.
3) Use a little bond to fix the outside body.
4) Use a pair of pliers to bend the lip straight.
5) Check for rust and repair with new metal
6) Always unload your van before jacking it up. (Cause your repair will not
be as strong as the original)

-Wayne
