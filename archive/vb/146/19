Subject: Pictures of a Westy SO34

I'm in need of some pictures of a Westy SO34 interior, because=
 i'm
trying to rebuild my interior.

I need closeup pictures of the "wood" behind the driverseat,=
 under the
long bed, under the fridge and under the single seat in behind

You might send the pictures to lars(-at-)splitbus.com and NO pictures=
 are
to big :-)
