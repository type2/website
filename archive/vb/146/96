Hi everyone, I am a member of the baywindow bus mailing list and have nev=
er posted anything on this list.  I hope it works and I did everything co=
rrectly.  I spotted an old bus parked in a lot beside int. 90 in the Eucl=
id area.  It was a 21 window.  It is in rough shape but has some good par=
ts from what I can see like all the windows intact along with what looked=
 like a good dash.  It might be restorable.  I did notice alot of underca=
rriage rust and a hole in the frame rail.  I talked to a guy who works at=
 the shop whose lot it is and he said the bus belonged the owners brother=
 who has passed away.  He told me the owner would probably give the bus a=
way.  This is only hearsay.  It has been sitting a while.  I hate to watc=
h busses rot away so I figured I would pass the info along.  I would like=
 to see the bus go to someone who plans to get it back on the road, but I=
 know this isn't a perfect world.  At least it could be used to bring oth=
er busses back to driveable condition.  Please email me if you need detai=
ls about this bus.  I would be glad to point you in the right direction. =
 I dont really have any way of knowing if this post makes it through so i=
f someone could reply anyway about weather it went through or not I would=
 appreciate it.  Thanks, Brian  71, 78 westies         =20
