open a couple of inches when they run on the hiway. They all swear that
it decreases the temp 25 degrees . anyone try this on a type 2, if so did
it make a difference?

All you do is recirculate the warm air, both on a bus and a bug.  It's
worse on a bus because of the shape of the vehicle.  Leave the lid closed
and make sure your rubber seals are intact around the engine and the lid.
