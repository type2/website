  The best thing to do, is repair as best of your ability, then go buy a
cheap floor jack to use to jack up the bus when necessary. In ten years of
bus and another 15 of air cooled I have never used the jack points on any
air cooled VW and/or Porsche

ronnie  better safe then sorry

The PO of my 67 kombi did a terrible job fixing what I assume was caused by
an incorrect jack usage in the rear right jack point.

I need advices on how to repair this. 
Should I rotate the jack point clockwise using force? Should I replace that
section? How about the metal sheet?
Any input would be appreciated.

Thanks
