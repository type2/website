Subject: [VB] open deck lid for better cooling?


Some of my beetle freinds use a tennis ball to to prop the deck lid open a
couple of inches when they run on the hiway. They all swear that it
decreases the temp 25 degrees . anyone try this on a type 2, if so did it
make a difference?

If you have been looking in the adds in HVW and VWT you would find dozens of
adds for deck lid engine cool hinges that raise the top part of your deck
lid and make it act like an air scoop. Old news.
