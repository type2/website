Subject: Brazilian carburetors

I've got dual Brazilian Webers on a 1600 Type 2 dual
port engine.  Now they
are not working properly.  I bought the bus, a 67, 
with them on there so I
don't know the history there.  They are running very
rich.  The first
thought is that I should investigate re-jetting these
things.  They have a
metal plate under one of the top screws that reads as
follows:
Weber-228095-Lado Esquerdo-D 83.  They are single
barrel.  Can anyone tell me
if jets/jet kits are available for this carburetor? 
They look like the
Weber ICT carb.  Would the jets for that carb fit? 
Thank you for any
information or recommendations.

John Moore
