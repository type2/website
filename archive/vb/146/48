I am sorry that Jason is frustrated with buying/selling on the internet. I
agree with most of what he wrote but feel that I could pass along a few
thoughts.
The internet has become a doubleedged sword for sure. On one hand the joy of
finding hidden gems in the local newspaper has been ruined by having them
posted to the email lists the second that they appear but I enjoy that very
thing when posted from a distant city. Ultimately the benefit out weighs the
downside.

I have learned to be patient and persistant when selling a vehicle on the web-
especially in this most recent market environment. Overtime I have concluded to
the quality of the vehicle, the caliber of the seller/buyer and the level of
desire to sell and the associated price. You should get what you pay for and be
ready to react accordingly as a seller. Common sense dictates that a $500.
shell will command less attention than a beautifully remarkable $48,000.00 time
capsule, major investment, for your auto museum. My choice has been to provide
every possible detail in text and photograph to assist potential customers. I
admit that it might be over-kill but what the heck. Some folks might correctly
surmise that an ad is like a resume' (overview leading to a phone call or
personal visit) not like listening to someone's life story during an evening of
warm, flat beer. Hopefully they appreciate my helpfulness and intention of not
wasting their time. I respect the concept that they giving me their attention.
With clear, proper and HONEST presentation of the vehicle combined with a
peceived fair price in whatever current market environment will result in a
win/win sale.

Yes, in a word I agree that there is no substitute for a buyer doing his/her
homework, conducting the right research and ultimately inspecting the vehicle
in person, if they so choose, prior to making the purchase. A seller deserves
to have a strong deposit prior to removing the vehicle from the market. Buyers
should respect the sellers time. Dont waste each others time.
I think that the level of details in the ad should meet the needs of the buyer.
Rightly or not, I tend to provide details up front to help qualify the vehicle
in the mind of the buyers. It might be annoying if you are not searching for
that kind of vehicle but minimizes midnight phone requests and endless emails
asking for more photos.
Enough already from me,
