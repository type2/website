I hear ya.  I was doing 55 in a 35 on base (air force) an the Security
Policeman pulled me over and while he was walking up to my truck I saw
him laughing at my stickers which read "Too slow, too bad" and "Fast
cars suck".  He made a comment about my stickers and I laid into him
saying "Do you know how long it took me to get going this fast?  How
dare you make me stop".  He let me off with a warning.
