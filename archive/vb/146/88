Subject: Empty Trailor Going to Butte Mont.

I'm buying a bus up in Mont. and will be towing an empty trailor up there.
Can tow your bus or bug for you for fuel money. Must at least be a roller
with aired tires. Will be leaving Lake Havasu Sunday Sept 1st and will be
staying in Henderson NV. (Las Vegas) Sunday night. Will be taking I-15 all
the way to Butte. Can deviate alittle if it will help, just so I keep going
north. Plan on being in Butte early Tues. morning (Sept 3rd). e-mail me if
interested.
