Hey All,

After 9 days in Maui, my wife and I are back from our honeymoon and I'm 
back on the list.  We had an awesome time, but I tell ya...the tropics are 
not for me!  Too humid!

Even though we cruised the island in a new, black Mustang convertible (with 
a gutless 4-cyl in it!), I took note of every old VW I could find on the 
island!  In all, we saw only 3 split buses, maybe 18 bays, quite a few 
vanagons...some eurovans, too.  Loads of bugs...some real killer 
island-style customs, one restored, lots of daily drivers.  Rust is rampant 
out there...some of the VWs had some real cancer going on...others looked 
as normal as a mainland car.

I didn't get pix of any of the VWs we saw, but you'd be surprised at what 
we did find.  Ragtop baja out in the absolute middle of nowhere...behind an 
old house out on the lavaflows (old and cooled flows, of course)...a 
hippied-out bay window in the middle of the rainforest on the way to 
Hana...stuff like that.

We did also find some sweet artwork by a local guy who takes models, tweaks 
with them a lot, then paints an island background and photos the two 
together...very very sweet!  You can find his stuff at www.cruiserart.com, 
but we went ahead and bought them there and brought 'em home!

Looking forward to getting back into the swing of things.  Hope everyone 
else is well and your buses are running nicely!

-Taylor
