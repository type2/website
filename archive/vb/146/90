Hello All     The Test  that I have ran on opening the rear deck showed that 
there was no cooling advatage really ran a little hotter, oil temp and 
pressure , The best cooling thing was adding scoops this did drop the temp 
donw about 20 degrees, some say these will cause hotter trafic temps but I 
haven't seen that happen this is on a 1959 panel with 1835 cc  daul 40  dell 
, doghouse cooling , sump , full flow oil filter  Motor. running st wt 50 
dino oil.  Now on my bug  1967 pocket rocket  1835cc, dual  36 dells , basic 
same motor as the panel but with a lite flywheel, the off set deck did lower 
the oil temps and adding a scoop over the vents did even better.   later and 
have fun  Mark Dearing salem Import Service Salem Va   PS neither of these 
vehicles get ran in the real cold whether so I can't say what that would be 
like., but would guess that things would be better off back to OE.
