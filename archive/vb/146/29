Subject: [VB] 40 hp cylinders????


So thanks to all who have provided info and offers to help - I'm still
trying to figure out what I need.  The PO told me that my 40 hp engine had a
big bore kit - hmmm - I now suspect he was wrong.  I measured the inside
diameter of my pistons and they seem to be 77 mm (the outside diameter is 90
mm but I guess that is irrelevant.)  Anyway,  could these be pistons from a
1300 cc motor installed in a 1200 cc motor with 1200 cc heads?  I think I
measured the stoke and I get 65 mm - but that can't be right - I guess I
measured incorrectly and the stroke is actually 64 mm and that makes my
engine 1200 - but I would like to be sure that these are not 1300 cc
cylinders.

Anyone around Ontario have a set of 113 101 373 reconditioned heads they
wanna sell.  Of 371 A, B, C, D, or F reconditioned heads with short studs
that they wanna sell.  

TIA

JDD,
if you have 77mm cylinders than you have factory stock dimensions. The "big
bore" kit for the 1200 was 83mm cylinders that were honed out 77mm so they
slipped in.
