Hi JDD,
Best to find a matching set of heads that way the chambers are shaped the 
same and you can get them to match cc wise easier.  40 HP long stud pulled 
out, BTDT!

  He also said that he didn't think he could get the kit that was available

We see them at swap meets here and there in NOS condition.

Depends on how large.  Stock was 77mm dia., you can install 40 HP big bore 
cylinders at 83mm which will give you 1300cc instead of 1200.  That is also 
as big as you can go without having the engine choke on the 40HP small 
diameter intake manifold, unless you go with dual carbs.

>>Where can I get 40 hp cylinder heads?  

Swap meets, other VW nuts, old wrecking yards, or we should have some good 
cores in storage.......
