Subject: re:jack point repair

i bought a jack at sears - 3ton, with jack stands, and it has this pretty
cool thing that it goes right up to the chassis on the first or second pump,
makes it easir for lining up with a decent jack point.

i think it was around $140. worht it. very sturdy, too heavy to really take
with you on the road, but it lifts my bus really high, makes it easy to get
under.
