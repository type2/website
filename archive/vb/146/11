 The 3rd digit: 7 means it is a 67. Build date of Oct 66 means it is a 67.
Yours is an early one without dual mc and backups. Looking at all the 247
deluxes listed on Thoms registry, I only see one other 'early' one with code
430. 247078285 and it was built 2 months after yours: Dec 66.
What are the M codes on the plate behind the pass seat?
