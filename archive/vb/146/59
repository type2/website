Yup, I remember some USA smart-alecks who got caned (like, cain- not canned) in
Hong Kong for malicious mischief and vandalism. My kind of eBay auction at the
moment is more in line with that 1959 Desoto Firesweep stationwagon that was
recently up for auction. Rusty chrome, bad paint, 5 mpg, big old honkin under
dash airconditioner, that UFO funky smell in the back seat that smells like
sweat combined with old frenchfries with a hint of poopie diapers and cookie
crumbs. That $14. VW is bound to show up at the Chinese equivalent to the
Pomona swapmeet for a zillion yuan. ;-) I will be looking for NOS
anti-carbonmonoxide fume scoops on "DesotoPlanet."
