Subject: Ribbed bumper hardware needed

If anyone has any spare original carriage bolts for the ribbed bumpers, I
need 10.

Wade posted a good pic them on his new Binz:

Color does not matter.

As far as I know, correct-looking carriage bolts are not available.  If this
is not true, let me know.

Thanks in advance,
