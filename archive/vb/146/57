It's on Page 4 if you're like me and almost missed it. Nice and simple,
but effective looking.

Look at the tool called "Jack Pad"

best thing in the world for not mashing your jacking points with
hydraulic jacks.

The little jacks are more of a pain than help.  Splurge and get a real
jack. I know they are heavy and unwieldy, but they are so much nicer.
But I do not carry it in the bus either when I go places.  I stick with
some Bilstein contraption that came with the bus :)
