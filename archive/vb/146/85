Hi Ricardo,
REmove all the rusty sheet metal, which most likely will include the both the 
rocker panel & jack point.  Install new sheet metal & paint.  The jack point 
is a natural area for the collection of dust, sand, & dirt inside it if not 
spray out with water often!  When we replce our jack points we will be 
sealing the top of these to the body to cut down on this spashed dust, sand, &
 dirt from pouring into them.
