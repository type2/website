Subject: (F) Barbie gets a bus!

Happy Friday, all. While shopping in the local toy shop for a friend's
kid's birthday present, I noticed that while the new VW bus has not   
been released to the Dealers, our good friend Barbie can already get  
one. It has captain's chairs, seatbelts, all sorts of accessories, and
is available in blue, or the ever-popular Barbie Pink.                
And yes, it is as attractive as the lovely pictures we've all seen on 
the internet. Get yours now for only $29.99!!!                        
 On the bright side, Johnny Lightning does have a fine '65 single cab 
for a couple bucks. I grabbed one of those, but they were out of the  
Deluxes. happy shopping...
