Subject: Re: [VB] '67 Model Year Questions

Not always.....
My ex very early 67 had back ups and dual brakes only because it has M code
430. Early 67's did not come with them as standard equipment. That happened in
the middle of the 67 model year. A lot of early ones did not have either.
My 67 Standard does have 'em because it was made Feb 22, 67.
And it does not have code 430.
