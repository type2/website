Look at the tool called "Jack Pad"

best thing in the world for not mashing your jacking points with hydraulic
jacks.

The little jacks are more of a pain than help.  Splurge and get a real jack.
I know they are heavy and unwieldy, but they are so much nicer.  But I do
not carry it in the bus either when I go places.  I stick with some Bilstein
contraption that came with the bus :)
