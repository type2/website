Subject: Piston Ring Gap

What should be the piston ring end gap (mm please) when you set it inside
the cylinder on a 1500 engine?
The pistons have the following inscription on them:

<=
SP0,04		83,46
		Z16C

I guess the 83,46 is the piston diammeter. What are the others? 	

If it makes any difference the engine belongs to a '67 kombi.

Thanks in advance
Ricardo Sousa
