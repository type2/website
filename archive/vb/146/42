Subject: Sunroof skin dimensions?

Hi all, I'm making my own (temporary) outside sunroof
skin for my 1967 21 window deluxe.
Can someone please measure and tell me the exact width
of their sunroof cover (at its flattest point)?

I'd really appreciate it. 

Oh yeah, length doesn't matter (in sunroof covers,
that is).

Thanks,
Jason
67 deluxe "DARTHVW"
