As far as wheel bearings go, there isn't much difference. The rest is pretty much the same too. The nut on the back wheel is best
removed with an impact but, you can get an inexpensive tool from most VW parts places to remove it with a breaker bar.

If you've worked on American and Jap iron. VW's are going to be a snap for you.
