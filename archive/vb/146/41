Subject: 14 vs 15 in rims

Hello all,

On my 67 bus I have 14" wheel rims.  I see alot of earlier buses had 15".
What would be the advatage or disadvantage of me putting on 15" rims.  I
guess this would effect top end speed, acceleration and handling because of
the slightly higher ride, but better or worse?  and to what degree?  Any
thoughts or suggestions??

Thanks!!

Bob
