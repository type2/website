Subject: courteous T-2 drivers

I hear ya.  I was doing 55 in a 35 on base (air force) an the Security
Policeman pulled me over and while he was walking up to my truck I saw
him laughing at my stickers which read "Too slow, too bad" and "Fast
cars suck".  He made a comment about my stickers and I laid into him
saying "Do you know how long it took me to get going this fast?  How
dare you make me stop".  He let me off with a warning.

So I was stopped by someone the other day and complimented on my
courteous driving and allowing people to pass, I wasn't, the gas pedal
was floored.

A state patrol driver commented on my driving the speed limit and
staying to the right for faster drivers, My gas pedal was floored.

The city police smiled while bicycles passed me, thinking I was being a
nice Joe. I wasn't, the gas pedal was floored.

It's kind of like a light switch, up for off and down for on, relatively
speaking.
