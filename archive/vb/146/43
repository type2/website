Hello List,
   I feel like I know you all, and yet none of you.  I have been
receiving posts for about one and half months.  I decided to finally
post out of neccessity.  I have become the very proud owner of a 1967 21
window that I found on thesamba.  Currently, I need some advice,
however.  I have a brake problem, and I think a wheel bearing problem.
I have never tackled a brake job on a t-2 and I am a little
intimidated.  I am in the process of finding a mentor locally, but in
case my two leads don't work out I need a VW jedi to give me some advice
and some pointers.  Most of my mechanic'n has been on motorcycles and
chevy's, that 46mm nut is enough to make you want to pop the hubcap back
on and pray for spontanious healing.  The problems are basically this,
I'm losing brake fluid in the rear right (believed to be a faulty wheel
brake cylinder) and a tat-tat-tat sound that comes from the front right
during braking (at first I thought that it must be the brakes, but then
I felt the wheel bearing and it was warm/hot).  I have done brake jobs
on camaro's and durango's and even a few suzuki's, what I need to know
is how the brake procedure differs and what in involved in replacing the
front right wheel bearing.  I know there is no subsitute for a good
manual, but I guess until I get mine, I'm looking for one anyway.  Thank
you in advance for being helpful
  Sincerly,
    Tim in Stillwater.
