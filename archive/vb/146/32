Degreeing cams is part art and part black magic. No one cam is "the best"
and dialing one in for your engine and all of its idiosyncrasies is where
the art part comes in. Usually carefully choosing your parts from existing
formulas already out there is the best way to go. Anything and everything
that can be done to a VW engine probably has already been done. If it was
any good, then it is part of the standard formulas.
