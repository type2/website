6 ft cheater pipe helps here! Unless of course you break the head of 
the bolt off leaving the rest in the drum. Chris La Fon can tell you 
about some dipsh*t from west Texas doing that to his '60 
Standard....right Chris!?!?!?

You mean I got ta throw my 6 ft cheater into the truck? Dang, and I was
usin' that for the kids!

Oh, guess what. One of my lug bolts or the drum threads is stripped. Oh
goody!
