I thought it was you who did that Rex ; - )  Yeah the poor '60 sat
helplessly for years while being picked apart by redneck buzzards toting
guns, beers, and 6' cheater bars. Till SuperRex the legendary Texas bus
magnet, saw the diamond in the rough. He rescued it from the scavengers
and an untimely death. Every hidden bus in Texas will eventually be found
by Rex.
