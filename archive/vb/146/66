basic advice-get the muir manual, and the bentley.

until then-that rear axle nut is torqued(or is supposed to be torqued) to
around 225ft lbs i think. I think this is impossible to get off by hand.
maybe with a cheater bar or it you are a big person.

once when my rear bearing went in the middle of nowhere-the mechanic used an
air hammer or chisel type thing. i could never do this without causing
irreparable damage-but he was very good with it.

as for the front wheel bearing-not too difficult by hand. well i did it
anyway, and my wheel has not locked up yet ~2000 miles later.

what you will want to get before you open it up are the lock washers-there
is one with two tabs on it, really thin. you bend the tabs between the two
nuts that hold the drum on. everytime i have messed with these they seem to
self destruct. i always repalce these. the other washer basically has a tab
inside the hole of the washer. this was broken on wone of mine, and on the
other side the PO just used a regular washer. so these have both been
replaced.

replacing the front wheel bearing-this is from memory. open everything up,
the bearings are kind of pressed into the drum. i used a long heavy
screwdriver and hammer to knock them out. then pack the new ones and
replace. that is a basic version.(obviously) i strongly recommend getting a
parts manual, Muir's idiot guid, and or bentley-so that you know where the
bearings all are and how they come out.

good luck.

ps dont go too far or too fast with worn bearings(mine melted to the spindle
because i didnt ralize there was a problem until too late)
