Hi all,
Question for the group:
1967 deluxe bus - did this come with single circuit m/c and brakes or dual?
Also, did this year bus have backup lights?
TIA,
-DB

Depends on the half of the year you own. My 67 SC is in the second half of
the 67 year and has a 22mm dual circuit. Buying the adapter plate kit, I was
able to mount a late model 24mm MC and the holes for the lines matched
perfectly. Even if you don't have a dual circuit you can go out to the
type2.com library and follow the instructions on how to make your system
into a dual circuit.
