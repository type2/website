Quite a trip!

If the CD player is a portable, take the batteries out - if it's in the
dash of the Bus, disconnect the power wires to it.  Let it dry out for
a few days - a carefully-applied hair dryer can help, but don't get it
too close to the works.  Even a fan blowing air on it will help some.
After a few days, hook it back up/put the batteries back in and try it.
Electronic stuff often survives fresh water like this - it's salt water
that really kills it.
