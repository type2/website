Subject: inverters/converters/capacitors/fuses

as per list reccommendations i have been to the local radio shack and not
only did they have the 8amp fuse, but they had a fast acting and a slow blow
version of the fuse. any recommendations either way? i assume the slow burn
is for devices that have spike surges-but don't want ot blow the fuse all
the time...

I also picked up a 470 microfarad capacitor to try to repair the second
inverter i have. this one does not have an arrow on it, so i guess it is
non-polarized, so I could hook it up either way, right?

The third purchase was a 4700 micrfarad electrolytic capacitor, 35WVDC
maximum, axial leads. as matt suggested-for $4.99 [so you were off by 99
cents matt ;)] This has an arrow, with what appears to be a negative sign in
the middle, on it. i was a little confused about your instructions for
hooking this up matt. you suggest "Connect the positive lead to the wire
between the inverter and the radio and the negative lead to ground." that
sounds like three wires would need to come out of the capacitor. If I take
the power lead from the inverter-got to the capacitor positive, then hook
the capacitor negaive up tot he ground, where do i hook the radio up again?

thanks for all of your insight....
