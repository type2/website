> P.S. I have scanned VW Service without guesswork mechanics pocket book
dated Jan/61. It has alot of specs on VW passanger cars, transporters and
industrial engines. The total file size of the scanned book is 3.16 megs so
I can't e mail the whole thing but if you are interested in certian specs
out of it just let me know and I will e mail the pages to you.

Bob also gave me a CD so it's on my site:

I could put a ZIP file on there too if that would be easier...
