Kevin,
What you will be doing is connecting the capacitor in PARALLEL with the radio.
This means that
The Positive of the CONVERTER, Radio and capacitor are all connected together
The Negative of the CONVERTER, Radio and capacitor and body ground are all 
connected together.

I went back and read the various posts about your problem and the shutting 
off when your volume is too high may be the converter shutting down on over 
current or over temp.  (Converter not rated to the current that the radio 
requires).

Putting a capacitor on the output may help it to ride out the peaks in the 
tunes, but may result in a longer period of time before it shuts down.
