Well, hopefully your soon-to-be widow has at least taken out a large life
insurance policy on you.  When you crash, try to go in front end first,
so all the DC-specific rear end sheet metal can be used on the DC of
someone who isn't running quarter-century-old tires.

Besides the tread wear, the rubber in tires degrades with time, from
exposure to the sun, ozone, chemicals, etc.  Your tires can have plenty
of tread and still be ready to pop at any moment.

Please get some newer tires for your double cab.
