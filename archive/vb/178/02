Subject: [VB] rear disc brakes

I am almost done mine as well :)

Hopefully the Thanksgiving weekend will give me some time to destroy the bus 
to put them on.

Early 944 rears with e-brakes and all!  Only for small nut RGBs.

Worried about how the Fuchs will sit in relation to the fender though...  
Maybe Thom has some 911 flares I can weld on and I will dump the 6"s in 
favor of 8"s.  LOL   Nah, then the SUV trash might see me coming :)

Lots of action a brewing in the Pillow garage!  Stay tuned.

Later,
Adrian
