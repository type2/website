Like Craig said, get some new ones.  I blew a tire that was only about 8
years old on my dieselvan last summer.  No rollover, but it made a real
mess of the rear fender.  Dry rot.  Just drive slow and not for long
distances if you are on those tires.  My tires are $350 a pair but it
would have still been much cheaper to get new ones.  I saw some dry rot
but figured it didn't go all the way through, there was still some good
tread left.  I'll replace tires if they are cracked.
Just my opinion now days.
