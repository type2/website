Subject: Center pivot bushing orientation?

Hi,

A question about the center pivot orientation.

I am trying to find information about the orientation of the center 
pivot bushings.

1. The instructions from Bus Boys says that the grease grooves should be 
pointed towards the zerk fitting
2. A post in the archives says that they should be "closed on the 
outside and open on the inside."

Those two seem to contradict each other. And I could not find this in 
the workshop manual (bentley book).

So is it:

^

or

Thanks,
Conrad
