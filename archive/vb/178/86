Subject: swing lever bush - more info

Hi,

I am attempting to solve the riddle of the swing lever pin bushing 
orientation. I found the reference to the swing lever pin:

"The bearing tube in the support has a central grease nipple from which 
both brushes are lubricated. The bushes have spiral-shaped grooves which 
start at one end of the bush. Ensure that the ends of the bushes at 
which the grooves commence are facing towards the grease nipple."

So, I take it to mean:

v
z

I took a picture of the bushing and put it online at:

This would be if you are looking down at the bush from the top facing 
the front of the beam with the "U" facing the zerk. At least that's how 
I translate the workshop manual.

The bottom of the U is not open, but the ends are. This is my point of 
confusion.

Thanks,
Conrad
