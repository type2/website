Subject: [VB] OACDP updated

Hello list, the OACDP has been updated with a new manual that was
donated for scanning ages ago by fellow listee Karl.  It is a workshop
manual on Eberspacher fresh air heaters for Type 1 and 2.  I guess I
wanted to wait for the right weather to release it :-)  It's definitely
not because I misplaced about half of the files and only found them
today, no sir!

You can find the new manual here:

And the main site here:

Much thanks to Karl, and enjoy!  Type 2 coverage starts at page 38...
