Yes, we need to use the safest tires on our old VWs.  In New Zealand, I 
mostly used retread bias ply tyres on my old VWs.  They worked well and 
were very affordable.  Also, they had so little road grip that one was 
rarely tempted to challenge a curvy road at high speed.   If you got 
into a turn too fast the tyres would not grip and you would nicely 4 
wheel drift into oncoming traffic or off of the road.  No big deal.  
Good, sticky tires will cause spins and maybe vehicle rollover.  When I 
moved to Arizona with the two Kiwi VWs the  motor vehicle people made me 
change the tires.  The bias ply retreads were not good enough for for 
AZ.  I still have kiwi retreads as a spares in these vehicles.  They 
even hold air!
