Subject: Re: [VB] bias plys?

In early 89 my daily driver cbecame a 59 bus with split case tranny and 1500 
sp H case motor 28 pict carb and 14" rims.  I drove it over the Santa Cruz 
mountains several times a month- and daily up and down hwy 9 on the ocean 
side. (when I wasn't mountain biking that is)  This is lots of windy curves 
while climbing, with a ravine on one side and hillside the other, lots of 
tall trees both sides.  Gus the bus was real good at zipping around those 
curves. This is when I switched from a 73 westy to a split, and loved the 
handling improvement.   A couple times I borrowed my Dad's 86 (88?)Chevy it 
was one of those early SUVs forget the name.  But the center of gravity on it 
was higher, and I drove slower in the mountains than I did with the trusty 
old bus. (and slower on the flat in the bus)

 No mention of our beloved high center of gravity busses though.  Wade,
 do you know who makes a comparable (to what you have) bias ply mud and
 snow tire??  >>
