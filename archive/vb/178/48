Well, if you're slow and careful you can run just about any combination.
However, at highway speeds mismatched tires can handle strangely, as I
found when I put passenger 185R14s on the rear and truck 195-75R14s on
the front.  Every little crosswind resulted in an entirely new diretion!

BTW, the "donut" spares on modern vehicles are bias ply!

Weirdest tire story I have is driving down the 5 freeway smelling rubber.
I came up behind a toyota with one rear tire smoking away merrily.  I
waved the driver over and we looked at the tire.  The Bridgestone tire was
missing its tread.  That's the _complete_ tread including the belt.  She
was running on the two relatively stiff sidewalls still seated on the rim!
The whole works was too hot to touch without gloves!
