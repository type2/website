Actually, I think it's most likely the radio shutting off on under-voltage.
I have the same converter the Kevin is running and it doesn't appear to have
any overtemp or overcurrent shutdown besides a fuse.  It could be that it
stops oscillating with too much draw on the output but I've never loaded
mine up that hard to find out.

I mentioned that this probably won't solve the problem but may make it
a little better.  I am approaching it from the point of view that $5 is
a relatively cheap experiment that might yield acceptable results.  If
it doesn't, the next step is to spend considerably more on a different
inverter.
