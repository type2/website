I am starting to think that I have been trolled - in other words, you
were joking about the 25 year old tires just to get a reaction from
the list.

At the risk of making a bigger fool out of myself if I indeed have
been trolled, this makes me think of a credit-card ad:

Complete set of 5 new light truck tires                 $350
Mounting, balancing, and valve stems                     $50
New four-way lug wrench                                  $20
