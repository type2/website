I'm still running the 25-yr-old Firestone 700x14 8-ply mud and snow
tires on my 67 DC that the PO left on it--there are years worth of tread
left since I only drive it on weekends.  I'm doing fine with them
although they do tend to grab the ruts in those old Pennsylvania
two-lanes a bit too much and make me fight the steering wheel.  When I
emailed Firestone about them last year requesting more info, they said
take them off NOW!!  I suppose they were imagining another F*ord
Explorer disaster.
