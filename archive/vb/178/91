Hi Scott,
We have had 10 years with that kind of fuel with no problems so far, which 
could partly be due to us replacing all flexable fuel lines every 2 to 3 
years.  The ethanol definitely keeps the carb clean, but if your carb is 
dirty/gunky and gets a treatment of ethanol it is likely to clog up due to 
the avalanche of crud coming loose all at once!
