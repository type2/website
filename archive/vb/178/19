Subject: The "Bessie" Howl--

Bessie our 1967 Grateful Dead bus has come up with a howl. It starts at
45MPH in 4th gear and at 50MPH it is the loudest, then starting at 55MPH it
goes away--??
3.88 tranny was done less then 6000 miles ago as well as rebuilding of the
reduction boxes. Of course by two different people. Monday we will open up
the reduction boxes and check the bearings. Hopefully it is the axle bearing
in the boxes ? Otherwise it is open up time for the tranny again, bummer.
Anyone out there that has had a similar 55MPH howl? and what was it? Noise
the loudest at 50MPH and then stepping on the gas, and going up to 55MPH.
No, it is Not wind noise. Hopefully, TWWM, uj
