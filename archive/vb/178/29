I live pretty close to you (Cincinnati) and I'll tell you that it is never
difficult to sell a bus in this region.  The key is selling one at a fair
price.  In the past few years I have sold a 1975 Riviera ($2500), a 73 Westy
($2000), a 66 camper ($3500). All decent daily drivers, none show vehicles. I
had multiple offers on each and had no shortage of buyers. True story: When I
sold the 75, the buyer was standing in my kitchen trying to decide whether or
not he wanted to buy the bus, as he was standing there I got another phone
call from someone who wanted the bus, and they said they would wait there on
the line to see if the guy there was in fact going to buy it, and if he
decided not to, they could be at my place in 2 hours. Looking back, it
probably looks like i was trying to scam the guy getting this phone call at
just that moment, but it is an honest true story.
My experience is that if you have a bus that someone can come and DRIVE away,
you'll have no problems selling it. When you've got a project or something
that needs work to get going, it takes a little longer because chances are
that only a KNOWLEDGEABLE person will buy one in this condition.
So, If you sell it, they will buy it! Of course, your mileage may vary!
