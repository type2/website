The parts van Ron (Busdepot) sold me had new Chinese Warrior Tires on it,
with good specs for a 185R14C tire, 8PR, 1875 lbs capacity at 65
psi....(seems more lioke a D tire)-anyone know the source/supplier  of this
tire?  Has a pretty agressive mud/snow pattern, seems quiet, and has given
me no problems switched to my 78 Westy.
