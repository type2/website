Actually, the second bulb is for brake and tail light - it's a dual-filament
bulb just like the sole bulb in a US-spec tail light.

From that description it may well be in the turn signal switch.  If you
follow the steps under "troubleshooting" at
http://www.type2.com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html it should tell you
for sure.

If you decide it is in the switch, you can try a shot of electrical
contact cleaner (NOT WD-40 or penetrating oil!) in the turn signal
switch.  Shoot it in down along the stalk, or take it off the column
and hose down the "guts" with it.  Work the lever back and forth
several times.  This may or may not fix it, but if it works, it's
cheaper and less hassle than a new switch.

Good luck!
