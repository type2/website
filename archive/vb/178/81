Subject: Ethanol and old buses

There is a lot of talk up here about mandating the use of an ethanol/gas blend. I believe the ethanol has a habit of deteriorating the gas line resulting in the usual nasty situation......... 

Anyway, I am hoping that somebody on the list knows a lot more than I do on this. And if the above is the case, what are the remedies to running an old bus on this stuff.....
