Dear All--

I want to make an announcement, and a request.

The request first: I'm collecting stories on first time sightings of 
split-window buses. Not the first one you ever owned, but earlier, 
maybe even WAY earlier. . . the first time you ever SAW one. If you 
can remember, I would love to have it as a story for Old Bus Review.

Or, a story on why you ever decided to get a bus. What inspired you, 
drove you to do it. This can be completely different from the first 
time you ever saw one. For example, I've gotten stories from folks 
who remember seeing these beasts when they were young children! You 
do not need to be a member of NEATO (the club that publishes Old Bus 
Review) to send in a story. However, if your story is printed, and 
you're not  member, I'll make sure you get a copy of that issue of 
the newsletter.

The announcement: I'm also working on a book tentatively called: "The 
Best of Old Bus Review." It won't be called that, but that's the 
idea. I'm pulling together some of the outrageously good stories from 
the newsletter into a book. There's room for more stories/artwork 
from other sources, too. If you have something that you'd like to 
consider for publication, send it on!

There's no money in any of this, it's done for fun!

You can contact me at: type2tom(-at-)earthlink.net

Thanks!

Tom Brouillette
