I do time trials and DE's on road courses on the Victorace V700's in the 911, 
and have had really good experience with them.  One cool feature is you can drive to
the track and back on them, unlike the Hoosiers.  Another bonus is they're
a *lot* cheaper than comparable domestic brands.

For a bus, I'd say start them out ~30psi cold, as you don't have the HP to 
heat them up that much; shoot for 40psi hot, high 100's across the tire tread,
higher to the outside.  For a bus I wouldn't bother with shaving or heat-cycling.

I have street Kumhos on my bus, which doesn't see much track use, and they 
work great.  I run ~44psi front/46psi rear.
