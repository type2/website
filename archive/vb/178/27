Subject: Thought of Selling my Bus:(

Happy Friday All,

Just curious if anyone near Louisville, KY would be interested in a 66 13 
window deluxe driver.  Don't want to sell him but probably need too.  Its 
got a nice non walkthru front seat.  Home made panels.  Early bay weekender 
package hacked at the beltline for window viewing;)  Cabdivder hacked but 
have one to throw in.  Newer 205/75/15s.  Just a feeler.

Thanks,

Eric
