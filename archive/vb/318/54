I greased the inside (around the shaft) but not the outside (trans
case).

Yes.

Now for my next question, to Clara and everyone... How much oil is too
much on the clutch friction material?

I had oil all over the bell housing so I mopped that out and then
decided I should check the clutch.  I took the pressure plate off
and I can just barely tell that there's been oil on the steel
surfaces -- when I drag my finger across them there's a hint of
oil.  Same for the contact area on the flywheel.  The clutch linings
weren't dripping with oil but I guess they have to have some if the
contact surfaces are oil.

The clutch seemed to be working OK before this.  What I am mainly
wondering is: can I hose down everything with solvent and motor on,
or is one drop of oil on the clutch plate too much?
