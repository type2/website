My guesstimate:

The seal has a hard periphery, so if it wasn't bent up, then you didn't
rip the lip of the seal with weight from the engine. Check with a finger
and a flashlight, being careful not to cut yourself on any rough edge in
there. The shaft where the lip rides should be smooth and oily. No hard
edges. Explore carefully to see if anything ripped the seal's lip. Don't
cut yerself! You might have ripped it during its install. You should use a
pipe going over the shaft to evenly move the seal into the tranny. I lube
the seal's lip when installing that seal.
