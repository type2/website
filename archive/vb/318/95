Subject: [VB] one more ( i promise ) gas tank question

	Last gas tank question ( heh heh ).  The fuel sender: does the seal need to be replace ( does it go bad? ) when replacing it or the fuel tank.  I can't really tell - are the bolts hex?
  Anything else I should check when replacing the gas tank? ( my front engine seal is in good shape and the T/O bearing and clutch was the the one thing the PO did prior to my ownership. )  Since the gas has already leaked out on my workplace's parking lot - should I need to feel guilty about replacing it in said parking lot this weekend? Maybe a little PO-15 or paint for the engine compartment?
	
	thanks
