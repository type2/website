Subject: Re: [VB] 34PICT-3 and 009/1776 

OK, then!  I think I might be closer...I won't know 'til some freeway
driving...comparing climbing ability on some big hills that I am very
familiar with.

I ended up leaving the 75 air jet in for now (change one thing at a time at
this point), and took a 120 main, and drilled it to an
approximation...smaller than the jet that was in there when I had really
sooty plugs, and bigger than the 127.5 that I tried a few moments ago.  I
can get it to stutter a bit, but am now able to crawl up a hill (on my
driveway) in 2nd gear at 15 mph and accellerate smoothly from there.

Before, I had to rev the engine to 2500-3000 just to get it going in 1st,
but that is not the case any more.

So that is good, but if a 75 air correction jet is way too big, what does it
do?  What should I look for?  Symptoms?

OK...enough for now.  I'll watch temp tomorrow during my 4 hour drive, and
after it cools a bit, at the VW shop, I'll pull a plug or two to check.

I will definitely take my stash of jets, just in case!

Thanks a lot for your help!

I would go with a minimum of 127.5 main and 55 air. I run a 132 main and
60 air on the carb that was on my old 1776 prior to switching to the
Holly 5200 progressive.
