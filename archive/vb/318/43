Hey Y'all,
I want you all to go and mark your calendars right now
for June 4, 2004.  Yours and my Favorite Bus Event
Band "Man Made Moon" will be having their Cincinnati
music scene debut at the Mad Frog Brewery in
Cincinnati, Ohio (right next to University of
Cincinnati campus).  Joining us will be two other
bands "VooDoo Blooze" a straight forward rock-n-roll
band and "Travelling Barefoot" a neo-grateful-deadish
jam band, and of course us, "Man Made Moon" coming at
you with some down-home roots\americana
folk\rock\thing.  Here's a link to the web site with
the info, scroll down under the "venue" column and
look for "Mad Frog".
I would love to have a big friendly crowd there, so
every bus person from everywhere is invited, and if
you are coming from out of town, YOU ARE MORE THAN
WELCOME TO CAMP IN YOUR BUS AT MY HOUSE! Here's the
