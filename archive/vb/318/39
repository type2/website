Subject: RE: [VB] Heater box to body hoses

I had a similar issue, with the 'heater muffler' end larger than the heat
exchanger outlet.  So I used a hose similar in material to the fresh air
hose, to slip onto the heat exchanger,  and then used a PVC pipe about 6" as
an adaptor to go inside the 'heater muffler' and the other end is a nice
snug fit for the hose.  Slip the 'heater mufflers' over the chassis heater
tubes, tighten and a couple of worm drive hose clamps and it works great.
