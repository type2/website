Bob,

I think a 74 will not fit.  You should be looking for a 68-70 beam.

I have a 66 d/c and a 75 beam won't fit, and I was told 71-7?
(beyond 75) all had the same geometry.  A 68-70 beam will bolt
right up, and then you can ditch the front drums for discs.

If you want to keep the wide-5 pattern, you'll need to get
adapters (yuck!) or get one of the aftermarket systems that
has a wide 5 pattern in disc brak format for a ball joint front end.
