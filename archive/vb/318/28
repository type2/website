So what do the volks use?  I have been using this kinda coil stuff - sort of
like a slinky wrapped in aluminium foil.  I was hoping that I could use one of
those black accordion kinda tubes.  I thought that would have been stock on my
60 but I guess not.  I think those accordion things would be quieter and
slightly warmer than the stuff I'm using - but I've just been told that I
can't get them short enough for my bus - I think my should be ... about 2" in
dia on each side and about 7" end to end.

Any ideas?
