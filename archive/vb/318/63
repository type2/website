hey ric. the reason for the dwell that changes is the shaft actually
is wobbling a bit in it's position. sometimes it wobbles toward the
points and this causes it to stay open longer. other times it does the
opposite and this makes the dwell increase as the points remain closed
longer. I'll grab the 009 from steph's bug w/ the pertronix in it and
we can see what happens to babcia w/ that in it, if you want.
