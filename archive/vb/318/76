Gary,
 
 To the best of my knowledge Bugs never had 14" wheels, so those would be bus. Bus 15" wheels have four "slots" in them. 15" Early Bug rims came in two styles; Smoothies- No holes in rims at all. (all bugs from 54-65). 66-67 bug rims are 15" and have holes all the way around them, similar to the chrome "porsche style" rims you can buy.
