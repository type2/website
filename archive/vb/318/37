I was the winner of the free flight tickets the Jerome before last. Donated 
them for a charity auction with Butch's approval to a school girl we heard that 
was fighting a tough illness, maybe lukemia. It turned into a passing of hat 
and 800 some was raised on that girl's behalf, with which Butch added his 
personal donation of free flight tour for that girl. That's just one encounter of 
his kindness that I personally witnessed.

His presence will be missed.
