Subject: Old Clutch Cable

Does anyone have an old clutch cable they don't need?  I need to do the old
clean the heat riser tube with a drill & cable trick but don't have an old
one.
I'd be glad to send postage if someone is willing do drop a scrap one (or at
least a few feet of one) in an envelope.
Thanks!
Mike
