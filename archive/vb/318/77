Subject: Everybus Kid's Activities Coming soon!

Hi Folks,
Everybus is almost her and I am asking for help.  I need 3-4 tricycles or Big Wheels for the EB 500.  If you have one or two, please
bring them along.  I have almost everything lined up (including trophies for EB 500) so please help. If you can help, let me know.
Thanks.  See you at Everybus!
