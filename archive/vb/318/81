Subject: Teardrop Trailer

I was the lucky guy who got Paul Smith's handmade teardrop trailer. I 
remember seeing it when he brought it out to a show for the first 
time. I had planned on building one myself. I had done lots of 
research on how I wanted to build it and had even acquired a trailer 
frame for the project. When I saw Paul's I remember thinking, "Man, 
Paul built my trailer!". Reason why is he got the shape right. All 
the ones I see people build end up with the wrong shape. Also, I 
didn't want a kitchenette. Paul's was perfect. So now a year or 2 
later I end up owning it and can use my trailer frame for my boat. 
Thanks for the killer deal Paul. I love the trailer!
