*****Ever go into a machine shop and get a wiff of the smell in there??
It's the Hydro Seal tanks ---*****

Question: Is this stuff flammable? I work in my basement/garage and I am 
pretty responsible with anything that might have caustic fumes or 
flammability. I have heard great things about a product called Safety Clean. 
Would this be a comparable product? I am looking for the best cleaner to use 
trying to stay with in the safety factor and get great performance. I have a 
parts washer (basin type) and have used degreaser/water solution(basically 
strong soap) with poor results when it comes to engine crud. So I am looking 
for a replacement that is more like a solvent and plan to add a seperate 
holding tank for it.

*****DO NOT APPLY TO THE CROWN JEWEL'S---:>)*****

No sir, Ivory soap and a vigorous hand motion(Hey I can clean them as fast 
as I want to, they are mine.)

Off Topic:

I was in the local FLAPS the other day with my daughter. I was looking for 
some various things and my daughter had a suggestion," Daddy why don't you 
get a bottle of that stuff that makes everything work?". "And what would 
that be?" I asked. "Well Grandma calls it Elbow Grease. Do they sell that 
here?"

Thanks for the help,
