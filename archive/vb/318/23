Subject: 34PICT-3 and 009/1776 (was Trip Report (Rambling))

OK....I have info...and here it is:

Engine size:  1776cc, 009 dizzy with Compufire, 34PICT-3 (German), timing at
30 max.

Spark plug indicates running lean (I'm pretty sure) but not overheated.  I
have a couple pics to pmail if interested.

The main jet I removed when having major problems was 125 (but may be the
one I drilled out...unsure)

The main jet I replaced it with is 115 I think...there is a scratch
obscuring the number.

The air correction jet that was in the carb is 60

The pilot jet that was in the carb is 60g (whatever that means)

Available to me now, from other carbs, are main jet sizes 127.5, and 120
   air correction jets 125, and 75

I also have two g55 pilot jets.

I am thinking to put in the air correction jet 125, and the main jet 127.5,
with the same (60) pilot jet.

Then I go for a drive.

I will be doing 4 hours of driving to work tomorrow...I'll see what happens!
