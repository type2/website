Josh,

Go to Sears and get the 17mm flat ratcheting wrench - usually comes with
19mm on the other end. It'll fit over the upper nuts, and you'll getem off
easily. You need a hammer and a regular 17mm wrench for the bottom 2 nuts.
If your upper left bolt screws into an insert on the engine, you'll have
to reach up there from underneath with a 17mm socket on a ratcheting arm
in order to loosen it. My upper two bolts are glued in thru the starter
hole and the left side hole, so that the engine just goes in there with
two upper nuts. I use the flat ratcheting wrench from Sears. They're glued
in there with yellow weatherstrip cement. Ask me or look up my dozen or so
posts on this in the archives. I punch out the left insert so I can have
the upper left bolt go thru.
