from me:
I also use a 1/4" 10mm socket that I"ve shortened then ground down around
the outer rim with a 'wobbly' extension for a better fit around the front
of the manifold.  This is a tenuous connection at best through time as the
heads expand and contract and the otherwise unsupported manifold with it's
perched carburetor temple sways about.  I always give a coat of Gasgachinch
to the (very clean) sealing surface of the head and two coats to both sides
of the copper gasket before assembling.  It's sticky tenacious stuff.
