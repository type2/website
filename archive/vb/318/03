Subject: Re: [VB] what tool for manifold nuts?

I get both started .   I use a 10mm wrench.  The round end, and it needs to 
be somewhat skinny. Craftsman doesn't fit there.    Important to snug down the 
hard to get side with a wrench first, then I use the long 10mm socket on the 
shorty ratchet on the easy to get to side.   I think they only want around 7.5 
ft lbs.  The idea is to squish the copper gasket to make a seal.

I have various innoucous wrneches for specific purposes.  some are modified 
with a grinder.   Its like my skinny 13mm wrench works the forward carb to 
manifold nut. 

did you test for a vacuum leak by spraying them when the ending is running?

can't imagine the factory running down those hard to get at 10mm nuts on
the single port intake manifolds. is there a cool tool to hunker them down
with? i've thrown everything i got at them and they're starting to strip.
prolly the cause of my vacuum leak. - steve
