Subject: head removal

hey all, 
i just got a 64 EZ camper and i need to take the heads out so i can put them on my 1600. can i take them off while the engine is still in the bus? i cant get the engine to come out, cuz no size wrench firts the nuts. i cant use a ratchet because there is no room. i really need to get these heads off because i am planning on goin to bug a paluza with my grandpa, so i need the bus to run. thanks in advance.
