Subject: Dumbest camping thing I have ever done

Hi Folks,  Since it is Friday, I will tell you all of my last 3 weeks.
Week one- got Goldie out of moth-balls and started getting her ready for
EB and this years camping events. Tuned it up, etc. Second week-
installed a few things to make the drive to EB more pleasurable and
start arranging carabus with John Bake, et al. Getting really psyched
about bus outings. Third week- make arrangements to close my one man
shop, get everything done and ready to close on Wednesday.  I'm all
ready to go, got cherries packed, clothes, camping gear, etc. Call John
B. for directions to his house where we are to meet- AND FIND OUT EB IS
NOT UNTIL NEXT WEEK.... How dumb can one person be, maybe I inhaled to
many fumes making the cherries. Just had to share..... TBear
