Subject: Front beam Question

Hello all, 
A while back I had asked about the best way to lower the front of my 66 S/C and someone had suggested going with the ball joint front end. Well I am going to have a front beam from a 74 bus narrowed and modified with adjusters to bolt on to the 66. My question is this; Since the new beam has disk brakes how much trouble am I looking at to keep the power assist. I have already noted that the brake booster and master cyl. mount to the beam where on the 66 it is in the front. Has anybody done this before and how much of a mess am I going to be getting myself into?
