Black and fuzzy plugs sounds like too rich. Also your air is way too
big, get back down to 55 or even better 50.

All right...I ended up putting in the 75 air correction jet and the
127.5 main.  Seems better, but the stutter is still there when I try to
lug it.

I haven't closed the butterfly hole yet.
Note:  Before, when I had the big problem going up hills at all, the
plugs wer BLACK and fuzzy.

I'm going to a VW shop tomorrow to get some brake parts, and I'll ask
him for jets, too...
