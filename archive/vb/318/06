Gene, if you are running the 009 on your 1776, which I suspect you are,
you need to go out to the archives for the 34 PICT-3 and check out the
mod for running with a 009 distributor. I mod most of my 34 PICT carbs
for 009/050 applications and you regain that sloppy bottom end with
little or no hesitation. The 30/31 runs good right out of the box with a
vac or mech distributor. Go figure.

  Now I've got a 34 PICT on there already, and the spare is a 30/31, and
I'm not sure which I'd rather have on a 1776, so I swapped main jets.
After some crappy running, with black carbon flying everywhere, it
started to run better, and once back on the freeway, I found speeds of
70mph easily obtainable, although the low end torque I remembered was
not all there.
