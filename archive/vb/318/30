You should be able to find some originals out there somewhere.  Should
be a flexible metal tube with some of that burlap material surrounding
it (at least for a 60 bus... 63ish or so saw change to the plastic
coated material to insulate).

My fire bus has some of those black plastic tubes from a bay window bus
(?) in it... but it's not original to the 59 year for sure.

Jdd asked:
So what do the volks use?  I have been using this kinda coil stuff -
sort of
like a slinky wrapped in aluminium foil.  I was hoping that I could use
one of
those black accordion kinda tubes.  I thought that would have been stock
on my
60 but I guess not.  I think those accordion things would be quieter and
slightly warmer than the stuff I'm using - but I've just been told that
I
can't get them short enough for my bus - I think my should be ... about
2" in
dia on each side and about 7" end to end.
