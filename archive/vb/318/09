Subject: Transmission oil seal question

All,

I replaced the oil seal on the transmission input shaft as a preventative
measure.  I had some trouble getting the engine back in (I had it going
in cockeyed) but I finally got it back together.  The next day... leaking
transmission oil.  Pulled it apart again and got the seal out - its
inner lip (the one that rides on the input shaft) was torn.  Okay, I
need a new seal - but why did this one fail?  Is it possible to damage
this seal with improper engine installation technique?  Maybe I let
the weight hang on the input shaft and that beat up the seal?  This
might be impossible to answer if you weren't watching me put the engine
in, but any advice will be gratefully received.  Thanks!

Matt Roberds
