Thanks for that...I did spend quite some time poring over the archives with
respect to 34 PICT-3 and 009 problems and solutions, and am now a little
more confused, but at least I have somewhere to go.  I am about to go pull
the jets and see what size they are, and then rummage through my spare carb
bin to find a selection of main and air correction jets.  Then, sice
everyone seems to be using different jetting, I'll post what I have and see
if that's any help.

As far as the mod, are you talking about the closing the hole in the
butterfly?

If not, please specify what mods you mean, in case I missed something...

If nothing else, maybe I'll just stick that 30/31 I have on there and see
what happens!

Thanks!

Gene, if you are running the 009 on your 1776, which I suspect you are,
you need to go out to the archives for the 34 PICT-3 and check out the
mod for running with a 009 distributor. I mod most of my 34 PICT carbs
for 009/050 applications and you regain that sloppy bottom end with
little or no hesitation. The 30/31 runs good right out of the box with a
vac or mech distributor. Go figure.
