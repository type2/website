Stevo,

Clara's right, here. I use an old craftsman 10mm wrench (smaller than the
latest ones - 1973 vintage), and make sure you have the matching 'warpy'
washers under the nuts. You can get them from WW online. As Clara notes,
they only need about 7 footpounds torque. I apply Permatex Ultra-Gray
hi-temp silicone 'gasket maker' to all surfaces, then mount and tighten
down the manifold before it sets up (20 minutes). Let it dry a day before
running the engine. I also use Permatex silver anti-sieze on the threads
of the studs, to protect them from rusting, siezing up. Makes it easy to
undo them next time. Looking at Clara's words again, my manifolds/heads
are TWO-port; if yours are single, then probably omit the silicone sealer
- those round copper gaskets are your seals. Seams down (right Clara?).
