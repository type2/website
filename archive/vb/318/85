Subject: Bulb holder and preferably 12v bulb needed for guage

I need a bulb holder/bulb for my bay window clock, the small tab style,
much UNLIKE my massive splitty guage bulbs. I assume a bay window speedo
or the like has the similar bulb/housing??
Anyone have a 12v bulb and its mounting so I can mount this clock? All
the yards here don't have or refuse to search down such a small item.

Thanks,
Al
