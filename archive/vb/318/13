Ya, I was talking about single port.  I'd use silicone on the DP set up too.  
I don't bother using goo with the round cross section copper circle crush 
gaskets, but someone else said they used some sort of gaskacinch goo stuff... 
couldn't hurt...

undo them next time. Looking at Clara's words again, my manifolds/heads
are TWO-port; if yours are single, then probably omit the silicone sealer
- those round copper gaskets are your seals. Seams down (right Clara?).
