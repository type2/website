Hi Matt,
You probably could get away with the clutch disc with a tiny amount of oil.  
Though while you have it apart you sure can easily use some Brake Kleen that 
comes in a spray can to clean off the oil on the clutch disc.  Just try and not 
let your skin get touched by this chemical or it causes the skin to dry out 
and crack off nastily!
