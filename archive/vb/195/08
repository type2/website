Hi Rich,

Thanks for the great overview.

Any thoughts on reversing the dolly... turning bus around and putting dolly
on the rear... and using the tack on lights on roof :)

It would allow the ligher front to bounce if something hit belly pan? Maybe
I'm not thinking this through?

I agree the trailer will work - great for going to a show, but it is one
more thing to tend to.

Yha, I know a bus likley isn't the most pratical toad, but want to give it a
good try.

  Stephen

They sell
light kits (Ive seen them at Camping World) that you can stick; they have a
magnetic base; on the roof of the bus or in the back window.  They plug
directly into a standard trailer electrical connection.
b) tow dolly.  Because the front wheels are in the dolly the entire front
end of the bus is raised.  Keep in mind that when the front is raised, the
back becomes lowered.  Given the fact that the engine is in the rear, I am
afraid that the lowered back end combined with the weight would cause the
back to bottom out (scraping the engine/exhaust) too easily.
