I'd like to find media that would give me a nice soft sheen on cylinder
>heads and pistons.
 
I've heard about people using baking soda. Might give it a try.

I'll probably give that a try.
I don't mind buying media but most times 50 pounds is ten times what I
need.
My son buys ceramic media for casting ceramics, it looks like pretty good
media for a nice finish.
I'm more interested in just a polish effect rather than any abrasive
effects.
