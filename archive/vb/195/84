Subject: Re: [VB] Paint code question

Hi, Gary-

I have the following information from an article written by Jim 
Bryant for Old Bus Review (1999). I thin it is accurate:

"for bumpers, wheels and the VW emblem on the front. . . L82-Silver 
White (though variations were available)."

I hope this is useful.

Tom
