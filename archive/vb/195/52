Subject: Re: [VB] How would you write your bus ad?

I would list what was original, reconditioned original, repop, and what was incorrect.  For example:  1956 single cab - original paint, reconditioned break system, repop door and kick panels, 1600 single port engine.  I'd include in the description the good and the bad.  For example:  the good is that the metal is free of rust, the bad is that the nose is caved in.

What makes me laugh are people who talk about OG (Original German) or the ads that read "fully restored" and what is being described is a re-sprayed two-tone commercial vehicle, slammed to the ground with limo-tint windows and 2110 motor.

By the way, no VWs were harmed in this message... my single cab is not as described above... in either paragraph.
