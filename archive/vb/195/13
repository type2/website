Subject: Re: [VB] Towing a splitty with folding / quick disconnect

It would allow the ligher front to bounce if something hit belly pan?
Maybe I'm not thinking this through?

Throw a few bags of cement or play sand in the front floorboards.
Cement 84-90 pounds per bag, 4 requirerd. Sakreet works too.
I don't know the weight on bags of play sand but should be about the
same.
If you have slack in your steering use a tow dolly ........... same
scenarion on the added weight.
Farthest I've ever towed a van was 250 miles but it went well.
