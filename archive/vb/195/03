Subject: How To Tell Original Hubcaps?

Maybe this is a "David Mayes" (hee) topic but how do people tell original
"half moon" moon hubcaps from the repop's. I have my own particular theory
but happy to hear other opinions as well.

Would like to hear your input and yes am always interested in buying good
used *original* hubcaps.

Boring Saturday night here in TO can't you tell?

Thanks
