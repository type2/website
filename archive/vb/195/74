Subject: Re: [VB] delayed test drive

Do you have the brake drums torqued? If you have the backing plates on
the tube ends, with the covers on, and did not finish the brakes and
torque the 46/36s at least some, the trans may drip at the axle ends.
The oil weight should not be a major concern here, as it will just get
thinner when it's hot. If your leak is near the trans, check the side
plates and the covers, my driver side cover will drip some when it's
hot, they seem to get distorted easily, which I was told by the much
more experienced recently (THANKS RONNIE!)
Happy Holidays!
