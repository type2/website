  Calling all busses. Get that hot rod bus ready for VW Drag day 2003

Calling All Type 2s
Ronnie Feitelson of www.TYPE2PARTS.com <http://www.type2parts.com/> has also
come on board and will be sponsoring an all VW bus bracket/class at the Hot
VWs Drag Day March 23rd. Early Splities, Bay Windows and Vanagons will
compete against each other for the top Type 2 spot. Jerry Jess of Phoenix is
bringing Rudolf, his 1965 High-Roof Beer Truck to run down the strip. Anyone
else out there have a High-roof to race?
