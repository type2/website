Subject: Re: [VB] RE: anyone have a scan of mr.bubblehead?

The one I sent out was not a scan. I had a poor pic that I had pulled off
the web. I printed it then filled it in (for a better pic), Snapped a pic
with my Argus dc3550, enhanced it in photoshop then sent it out. It is
posted at my msn site and then anyone who want's it can just go there.
