Subject: Slightly OT: Wiper SW Question

Hey guys,

I've been having some trouble with an aftermarket wiper switch in my 62 
Bug...now I've not noticed a real difference between the wiper switch in my 
old bus and the one in my bug.  It's on...or it's off.  Simple as that.

Can anyone out there tell me if I can simply get an on/off switch from 
Kragen or whatever and put that in inplace of my aftermarket switch?
