>>torque the 46/36s at least some, the trans may drip at the axle ends.<<

Al, I did not have the drums on yet. How does not torgueing the drums cause
the leak?  If I torque the drums and then took them off later for what ever
reason, would it not leak because the seal is now properly seated?  Did I
just answer my own question?!
