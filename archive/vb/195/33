Subject: transporting a front door from No. Cal to So. Cal

Anyone visiting So. Cal???

I am looking for someone who is coming down from No.
Cal in the next month or so.  I am trying to get a bus
front door from Windsor (Above Santa Rosa on the 101)
to Huntington Beach. (Off the 405 in Orange County)  

Anyone coming down for the holidays who could carry a
door?

Please email me.

Thanks
Matt
