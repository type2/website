Subject: Testing Fuel Gauges/Senders??

OK let's see if I can explain myself.  My 66 Bus has a Custom (that way when I
bought it) Fuel Tank (about 20 gallons) with a Stewart Warner (SW)  Sending
Unit and SW Gauge.  The gauge is unhooked and still reading 1/2 tank, so I
assume the gauge is bad.  I can try and find a SW Fuel Gauge but would like to
use the 12V VW one I bought.

Does anyone know the Ohms range for a Stock Fuel Sending Unit?  The SW is a
240 Ohm unit, I don't have a stock one to test.

Dave
