Look at page 13.  It's much clearer.  I think that was the page Clara
was referring to in her post.  Basically, the juice comes in on 56H and
30A (and/or +) and goes out on 57P and 30A.  Page 19 describes the
switch action.

The only quirk of page 13 is that it shows the switch (item 22) and the
warning lamp (item 23) as two different things.  Actually, the lamp
is in the knob of the switch, so terminals 31 and 56a of the lamp are
really on the switch.

>Any issues with using a 6 volt switch with a 12 volt system?

Your heater will get twice as hot, enabling you to forge iron when it
is set to maximum.  :)

Seriously, the only problem would be with the bulb.  You'll need to
take out the 6 V bulb and install a 12 V one.  The contacts of the 6 V
switch will be carrying half the current at 12 V, so they should last
as long or longer than they would have on 6 V.  I have no idea what
type of bulb it takes but I suspect it may be a dash light bulb -
take yours apart and see.  You could call your friendly local
Eberspaecher dealer and order a 12 V bulb as 20 8516 17 04 01 (per
parts list, page 38).  If the bulb is an oddball that you can't
readily find in 12 V, you could keep using the 6 V bulb by adding
a resistor to the bulb circuit.  The resistance in ohms depends on
the current drawn by the 6 V bulb.
