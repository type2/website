Subject: How would you write your bus ad?

I've always found it interesting to read for-sale ads.  You can
often read a lot between the lines and discern (or at least form an opinion)
something about the seller and the car, without having met either.
As an example, the bus that Jerry just posted; the guy goes into
exacting detail about the engine mods, and all but glosses over the bus
itself.  I reduced the ad to:

1966 Kombi, camper windows, light rust, roof rack, 1600cc engine, $5500

From reading an ad, you can tell the 'depth' of busness of the owner,
and which aspects of the car they think are important.   In the example 
above, it would seem that engine stuff is important, and the bus itself
is just a holder for said engine.

So how would an ad for your bus read, assuming that you were selling it?
