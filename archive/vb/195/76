Subject: re-sandblaster

hello all  I use a blaster from Northern  the hoses and valve suck. The best 
compressor is the Dunn Rite VW motor compreesor, runs on 2 cly pumps air out 
of other 2. The one I have puts out 58 cfm at 120 psi all day till it runs 
out of gas,you can not out run it,got mine mounted on a little trailer  with 
a storage box for carrying blaster and sand,so I can do sandblasting 
anywhere. later and happy bussing  Mark Dearing Salem Import Service Salem Va
