FS:   1963 Westy SO33 .   Lots of rust, lots of missing parts, has been abused by PO for many years.  The engine is complete with many new parts- just not assembled or installed.  Rear wheel wells hacked out, front wheel wells hacked out, dash hacked out. The remains of a front bumper are welded to the frame, but I'll throw in a an extra bent & rusty one.  The grey primer finish looks great in pitch dark or from over 100' away.  Most of the glass is fogged, all the seals are shot - except the ones that are missing. New tires and battery :)  Runs great except for the lack of an engine, decent brakes, loose steering -but man, these tires are nice!  The rims are blasted and repainted so they are shiny too!
