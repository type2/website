Hardtop 66 Dlx. All original paint, would require respray and body work
to massage out years of whoops and rock nicks. Windshields not original.
Seals toast. Front floor needs help, along with cargo entrance and
center of battery tray. Recently unlowered. Rebuilt trans with all
german bearings new 4.12 r and p, new pinion bearing, and redux boxes
with german bearings. New 1600, looking stock with 30 pict, 205 dizzy,
preheat. Tires new but are passanger tires with insufficient rating.
Needs alignment. 8ft Tom Conner rack in shiny primer grey. Lotus white
l82 over same, mesh plat. interior, have all oe panels, but they are all
ruined due to previously mentioned shot seals. Seat nice, but not
recovered in correct fabric (just vinyl). No radio, 62 bus block off
plate in blue, that doesn't fit right. Headliner almost perfect. Center
of steering wheel damaged due to DPO, spare included. Has bumpers, rear
cut by aforementioned DPO as well. Asking a fair price or will sell on
ebay for ridiculous one instead. 

That's how mine could read.
