Subject: delayed test drive

I finally got my new trany in and thought I was ready for a test drive.
Until I noticed oil dripping from the end of the axle on both sides.
Appears it is coming from around the seal. I used hypoid sae 85w90 oil.
Is this too thin of an oil? The seals and gaskets are all new. I thought
I would throw this question out before I tear back into it.
