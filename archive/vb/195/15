Hi Busbarn,
Very close!!  The only mistake is that the adjusting screw should never hit 
the valve stem absolutely square in the middle.  Instead it must hit it 
slightly off center so as the valve is opened it is turned slightly each 
time.  This rotation of each valve reduces wear on the valves and valve 
seats.
