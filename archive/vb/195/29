the diagram shows that the hot runs always from the fused wire (23) to the II terminal on fuseblock,and from there to both 
the
CL terminal on the thermoswitch.  This is so the fan can keep running after you turn the heater off (so it cools down) 

  hot also runs to the push pull (off/on) switch which you mount behind yr legs under the seat (light in knob should glow when switch pulled out-  super cool) 

the push pull switch has two terminals that the hot wire shouldbe hooked to,  30A and 56h (? furry image).   When the switch is pulled this sends the current to the 30A and 57a(?furry) terminals respectively,  30A sends a 2,5ro(red) wire to I (fuse on wiring block) .  

So use yr wiring light and find if the current is going through the switch to the destination 30A
re wiring. Is it getting to the hot side 30A?  is the problem in the switch?  Can it be taken apart and the corrosion cleaned out? Actually, it sounds as though you don't have a wire hooked up to the "in 30A", so in that case there sure wouldn't be any current coming out of the "out 30A".



Word is that the fuel pumps do tend to go.   Heard I can replace the diaphragm to fix it, but also that a brand new pump is available from Espar(the current incarnation of Eberspacher) for circa $30, which pumps the right amount of fuel. Dunno if a 6V one is available.
