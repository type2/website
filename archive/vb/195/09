yup - all of my blueprinting books, hoover, and the vw rags all 
discuss this at some length or other... most of the mags just gloss 
over it, which is why i thought i could get away with doing it

having the wrong rocker/pushrod/valve alignment at best robs 
horsepower, at worst breaks things! in my case, it caused a lot of 
headaches, but better on the stand than on the road.........
