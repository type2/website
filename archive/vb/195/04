I assume this means the proper rocker arm to valve stem alignment.  At half
way into the lift, the adjusting screw should be perfectly straight with the
valve stem and hitting the stem square in the middle.  Most people don't
bother to check this, but a mis-aligned and/or mis-adjusted rocker arm can
cause early valve train wear and failure.
