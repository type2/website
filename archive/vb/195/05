I was looking at the calander pictures and was curious if anyone knows
how that 23-window is set up to tow that camper (does the hitch mount to
the bumper?)

This looks like the answer to my camping prayers, also would a 1776 pull
that trailor around?  I was thinking of converting my deluxe into
something that I could camp in but it seems like alot of work and would
probably be easier to just start with a camper and work with that.
However if I could pull a little custom camper and leave my bus interior
alone I would prefer that.  Please let me know if anyone has had
experience with this.
