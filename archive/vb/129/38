Probably not. Except ,wasn't the 40 H a formula Vee ?!

65-66 Type 2, Type 3 flywheels are 200mm and 6 volts.

but they do not directly fit the 40 H since they have the O-ring.
The 40 H crank is relieved for .165"  length and the O-ring
cranks are relieved .365" length , so those O-ring flywheels must
be opened up to fit the 40 H.
Mark Dearing has suggested they may be opened up on a brake lathe.
Just wondering what happens with the O-ring there.
Eric&Barb have suggested that the centering ring may be removed to
apply the late release bearing to the 3-finger clutch cover. Interesting.
