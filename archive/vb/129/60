well dag nabit i have been waiting for someone to mention that kinda
protection. my rear left wheel came off in slow motion. i drove out to get
my bus new plates at the dmv, and what a happy morning turned blue. heading
through the neighborhood i made it one mile to a stop. first in line at a
red light i pulled out ever-so-slowly at a 45 degree andgle - a jog in the
road it was - and ka-plunk the wheel well and the rubber were mating. in
all my excitement getting to the dmv - no jack. moral of the story is my
friend suggested having even the uglyist, rattyist of hubcaps so as to hear
the noise of fallen out lug bolts. always felt that was good advice.
