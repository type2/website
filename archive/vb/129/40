Subject: 63 panel in Fresno

Harry and I found a 63 panel camper conversion in the Fresno Pick a part.
Appears to have been a Sundial. Not much left on it. Yesterday and today was
1/2 price sale days. About the only thing left worth saving is the [wrong]
later model large nut transaxle with reduction boxes.
The bus appears to have come from San Jose Calif. It is cream colored. Any one
know of it?
