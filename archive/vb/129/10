Hi Volks,
Definitely!  We used to overtorque using the stock lug wrench.  Once 
tightened we would have to retighten less than 1/2 mile later to prevent the 
wheel/s from falling off due to the lug bolts already loosening up!  Once we 
started to equally torque to the stock amount we have never had a single lug 
bolt loosen up as before even after 20 miles on a recently installed wheel.  
Even so we check ALL installed wheels about a mile later to make damn sure of 
no loosening and so far with doing this with both stock painted or 
powdercoated rims!!!!  After all there is also the slim chance that any grit, 
grim or new paint or imperfections in the paint between the drum and rim will 
crush slightly and allow the loosening of the lug bolts.  As to any 
particular drum being a regular loosening problem we would guess that someone 
use to big of tap to clean the threads.  Yes there are slightly bigger and 
smaller sized taps to cause differant thread fit!!!!!  Using a lug bolt 
ground like a self cleaning engine tin screw is a good low budget way to do 
this cleaning.
