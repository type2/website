Subject: RE: [VB] What are these red things?

In my recent aborted attempt to swap out my 3 speed 
tranny (pops out of 4th) the only part I changed were 
the red pads with stock German pads. There is a notable 
difference in vibration and in shifting. I say leave it 
stock unless you have a big engine and torque twisting 
is a real problem. My 1855cc with small Dells is happier 
with the stock.

p.s. Don, which aisle at the supermarket has Soylent 
Green?
