Subject: Our '61 Westy at OCTO-02

 Hi all,
Thought I'd mention that I uploaded a picture(one & only) of our
'61 Westy at OCTO last Sat. that I have been restoring for years.
It was it's first trip and it drove great.  Some of you might remember
it when it was infested with "The Mutant Bees"!  The pic is located
on thesamba.com under 'campers'.
  Lou & Liz
PS. Next trip 'Jerome Jamberee'
