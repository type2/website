Ah, you dry climate folks toss buses all too easily.  sounds like a good 
start for a daily driver camper to me, if you can buy if for a hundred bucks 
or so.

Around here, Every bus has holes in the front floor and rocker rot, unless 
someone repaired it.

 Interior was rough to say the least. "Z" Bed was some kind of tubing thing 
that needed legs propped. Table was very rough, but salvageable, has a weird 
curve, wider at the hinge. No cabinets except wardrobe and it's rough. Roof 
is good, but it's a panel with 6 flange one piece crank out windows .  You 
might be able to put together one good one from all of 'em. Maybe two upper 
aluminum window brows are useable. No front bench seat. The nose is in good 
shape with only one towel bar dent, rear corners abused, one good outie 
engine inlet with scoop holes. Didn't look under for rot behind the bumpy 
front bumper. Holes in driver's floor, rusted rockers on the passenger side. 
Probably a useable front beam and the big nut rear if anyone really wants it. 
Bits and pieces are in custody, rear window, rear hatch latch, apron, front 
window tops, handles, knobs, speedo, gas guage, turn signal, headlight assys, 
etc.
