Yeah, as John says, I run a long gas line.  I don't
coil it over the trans, though.  I coil or stretch the
extra fuel line in the left "battery tray".  Does
wonders for hot days here in the desert, because the
fuel is in the cool air flow from the left vent (NO
vapor lock) and I can sometimes pull my engine, do
what I need to do, and put it back without
disconnecting the gas line at all!

Fuel hose is cheap, and I never have a piece that's
too short.
