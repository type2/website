       I've got a buddy with powercoated rims on his Vair.  He's suffered no 
ill effects and he's got great looking wheels.
       As for wheels falling off, it has only happened to me once.  The 
reason, me!  In my hurry to get the bus ready for a Bug Out in Manassas, I 
plain forgot to tighten up the lug nuts on the left wheel.  I worked on the 
bus late into the night and was tired and grumpy.  The next morning as I was 
headed into town for supplies.  I was cruising at about 45 mph, tunes a 
blaring when the back of the bus jumped about 3 feet into the air!  In my 
rear view I saw my tire jump over the on coming lane (luckily no traffic that 
early in the morning) and disappear into the woods, as I got the bus under 
control.  It took a good 100 feet plus to stop the bus as the shock mount 
scarped the pavement.  At the time I was running Bus Boy axle tubes and SB (4 
lug drums), hence the low shock mount.
       Needless to say, I learned from my mistake.  I don't work to the point 
of exhaustion in the dark anymore and I lean a hubcap next to the wheels that 
I've double checked. 
                                                         Peace,
                                                               Frank
