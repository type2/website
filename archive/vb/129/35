Subject: RE: [VB] Re: steering box gear oil

	I bought one off a gentlemen that had a couple on thesamba.com
used for 50 bucks and it worked like a champ yesterday for a couple
hours of driving to a car show in Pismo Beach CA. That show is a cool
event even though there are only a couple of VW's in it each year it is
a big draw of people 30 to 40 thousand people showed up for all the hot
rods this year.

	Yes I will have to hit the gym now or buy another bus with bad
steering to get my exercise :-) 

Thanks for asking
