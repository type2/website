Jamie,

I'm not sure that I believe this(no disrespect here).  Powdercoating has 
to get up to 400 degrees before flowing...right?

The story doesn't talk about them going down a long incline at that point 
and I also cannot believe that all 5 lugs would fall off instantly at the 
exact same time.  

I find it difficult to believe that the brake drum to rim area will get 
that hot....anyone ever checked this with one of those infared 
thermometers?

I can believe that front disks might get that hot on the rotor surface 
after going down a mountain for 30 minutes, but rims getting that 
hot?...I'm having a hard time on this one...

Cheers, dave
