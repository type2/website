Bus Friends,

  I've had a wheel almost come off, it was held in by 2 lug bolts and was
wobbling going around a corner.  I was lucky!  I found that I must exceed
the 94lb torque to feel safe that it won't happen again!

  The rims and drums were POR-15 treated and some of it got in the nuts
and I had to use a lug bolt with a notch in it to tap it clean.

  The hand crank on VW jack also serves as my lug wrench.  I tighten the
lug bolts while it is jacked up, then when it is on the ground I tighten
them again.  Here's how I do it...I weight 200# and I stand on it and
balance while the handle moves down about 1/5 of a turn, not much, but I
know they won't come off and I know I can get them off by standing on it
to loosen it.  I know this is over-torquing, but I think it is safer.

Best,
joe
