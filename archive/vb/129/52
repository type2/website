I sure was glad to have my hubcaps on when my rear
wheel came loose...

Heard an ungodly clang from the rear on my way to
work, and stopped immediately. Two lug bolts were
completely out, and the others were partway out. Wheel
had been wobbling. If The hubcap hadn't been there to
announce the sound of the bolt leaving the wheel...I
might not have noticed for another 10 or 20 yards, and
by then....well who knows.
