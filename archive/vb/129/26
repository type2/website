Subject: New Bus Feedback

Hey all,
 I took a look at the new "Microbus" on VWs web site and sent the below in
on their comments feedback.
just thought i would share.

So I hear you plan to build this van.
I call it a van because it certainly is not a microbus, you stopped building
those with the inception of the Vanagon.Priced at $30 grand?? I can see that
price because of all the gadgets that are part of the van but it is still to
much for those who would have bought one for nostalgia reasons. The
newbeetle was a hit because it resembled a "modern bug", however this new
vehicle resembled Rosie from the Jetsons and not a Microbus. The eurovan is
a fine vehicle although overpriced, what you need is an affordable van for
the intro group and a deluxe for those who feel they need to spend $30
grand.If your going to tout this a the "new bus" it seems it would need to
resemble the old bus, those lights?
Also, I realize your target group with this van is people with money(lots of
it) but if you keep destroying the relationship with the vintage air and
water-cooled owners then you will have nobody left to support your car sales
when the yuppies lose interest in the "Newness" of your cars. I hear all the
time how folks thought of a new beetle, golf or Jetta but are getting a Mini
instead, good for BMW , bad for VW. Think of all the long time VW owners who
are doing the same. I wish I could say that when the time came to trade in
my Passat I would be buying a microbus but instead I will most likely be
purchasing a BMW,Mercedes or Chrysler. At least they dont make it difficult
to puy parts for  vintage BMW,Mercedes and Chrysler cars.
Thank you,
 Bryan Mitchell
