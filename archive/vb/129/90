Subject: Re: [VB] Overriders - Not Overriders

All US spec imported cars had overiders. It was the
law from what I understand. There are plenty of people
who do not understand what restored means as well as
unmolested or original! Just look at the classifieds
on the samba. I have seen "restored" vehicles that are
missing major pieces!
