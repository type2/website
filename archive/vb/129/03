Subject: Not screwed anymore


    In my parts book quest for screw sizes I got really screwed up. After
finally decifering all the chassis numbers and correct screws for what I was
looking for I went to the addendum in the back of the parts book and found
that a lot of the sizes were discontinued and superceeded by a different
part number, augh!!!!. But I did finally get it all fiqured out and now have
alist of all I need except one. NO where in the parts book did it list the
screws for the overhead vent cover, no self tapping, no machine screw nadda,
nothing. It did list the seal tape for the cover though.
    On another note, I happened into the paint section and was surprized to
see VW offered all colors of paint in SPRAY cans back then, pretty
interesting. It also listed a zinc spray for preventing rust I guess and
what primmers to use on complete and/or repairs. I found that section the
most interesting along with the interior section. I guess I need to browse
the parts book more often, all kinds of tidbits of useful info.

ronnie  not screwed any longer
