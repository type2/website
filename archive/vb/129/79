Subject: RE: [VB] VW denying their heritage?  More trademark stuff

This topic is really getting old....

Go to the licensing site that floated through this list a bit ago and read
it.  There are two basic rules:

- if you are an authorized dealer of *genuine* VW parts then you can
advertise you sell 'Volkswagen Parts and Services'.

- if you sell part or services for VWs that are not *genuine*, you need to
state just that... that you sell 'Parts and Services FOR VWs'

Understand the difference?????????


People need to get it through their heads that they are NOT doing this to
intentionally piss people off.... merely to protect their trademark.  If
they don't, the VW moniker and all related symbols and trademarks go to the
public domain and which company, big or small, wants that?

Sure one lawyer in a town can't make any money but two sure can... but
that's not the point here.


So, the key word here is 'FOR'.  I thought it kind of funny seeing the logo
on the wolfgang int. van at the classic with the 'V.W. parts' logo on the
side (i.e. not 'VW parts' ... clearly stating that they sell 'Very Well' or
'Vern and Willies' parts.

Let's all get on with our lives and accept the fact that they want to
protect their name..... or heck, maybe I can start advertising myself as
Ronnie.

nuff said.
