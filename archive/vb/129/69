Subject: What are these red things?

There are two red "spacers" made in USA between tranny mount and tranny
on the '65
(See pic)  What are these for?  I pulled a type3 motor out of here.
Should they be
removed to put in rebuilt 1600, Or can I just leave them?   Sorry, don't
have Bentley
yet.  Any help is appreciated.
