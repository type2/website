After counting the votes......

.........the engine is out. Takes just over an hour to pull and the usual
dose of gas on the chest ( anybody have ideas on disconnecting the gas line
with no spill). Really no big deal when it comes down to it and you can
almost do it in your sleep having been done many times before.

What takes the time is cleaning up this and that, tweaking the odd screw,
etc. before putting it all back together. After all, once the motor is out
who wants to pull it again.

I guess that's why we call it a hobby!

Thanks for the advice....... and it wasn't a surprise......
