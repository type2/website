Subject: road trip of a lifetime

my wife and i just woke up from a dream. it started in Chicago, IL and 7,500 
miles later it ended in Seattle, Washington. however, there are so many 
menories and images in between those two distinct places. We have a '67 
delux, but have converted it her into a semi-camper-with a bed and no middle 
seat. From Chicago we headed to Boston and stayed there a while and then 
went down the east coast-which was incredible. Being from the west coast we 
had never seen the atlantic coast and we were impressed. From Cape Cod to 
Cape Hateras it was beautiful. When we hit South Carolina we turned west and 
explored the South and the Ozarks. In Kansas things got real hot and we 
encountered our first trouble with the bus- the heat. 115 said the reader 
boards and our oil temp gauge more than doubled that. thanks to alex, john, 
jim, and then finally dan, in colorado we were asured that our cooling 
system was 100% and started driving during the early mornings and at night. 
new mexico and arizona we like nothing we had ever seen and the west coast 
is always like coming home- even if highway 1 made us seasick at times. well 
i am writing to let you all know that these buses are beautiful machines and 
functional as well - we are in the process of writing a book about our trip 
- lots of pictures and maps-and insights. it was one of the funnest 
vacations i have ever taken and it will be tough to ever match it in the 
future. i'll let the list know when the book is done-it will take us some 
time-happy trails!
