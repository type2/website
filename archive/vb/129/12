Subject: Re: [VB] Wheel Powdercoating not a good thing?

I'm glad those guys are okay.

only time I ever had a wheel come loose is when I drove my bus after my ex 
boyfriend had changed the gear oil (or for some reason he took the wheels 
off), and he forgot to tighten the lugs.  I felt the bus acting something 
funny and stopped, saw nothing wierd, then noticed one lug was backing out, 
others were not even finger tight.   He also forgot to put the lug wrench and 
tool box back in the bus so I had to wave down help to tighten the lugs.  
Thanks sweetie. 

So now you know why I don't use hubcaps- it's a safety issue (just kidding)

FWIW, I grease my lug threads.  WHY?  Because my bus loves grease, and I am 
sick of busting rusted ones loose.  I feel that I should be able to turn them 
by hand until the tightening bit of the threads.   It doesn't take long in 
this climate to rust, still they don't come loose by themselves.

But really, always helps to double check the lugs.  Like after you put your 
brakes together you have to readjust them a few days later, well double check 
the torque on the lugs.   I never had one feel loose, but I can see that 
fresh powdercoating could be a squish down issue.

Years ago  I saw a wheel come off another car when I was driving down a two 
lane country road in Oregon.  The car was coming towards me and the wheel 
sped in front of the car and  was kicking up sparks.   There was no room to 
dodge it.  Hit my bus on the front right door (which is odd but true).
