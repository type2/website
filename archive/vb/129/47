I just checked the one on my carb.  It's a metal cover element, marked
6 V.  I got 5.1 ohms cold.  I measured 1.35 A at about 6.1 V (yes, my
battery is discharged) when I powered it up, which gives a resistance
of about 4.5 ohms.  This also means that it is about an 8 watt heater. 

I don't know what the resistance is on a 12 volt choke element because
I don't have one handy to test.  If the 12 volt elements also use
about 8 watt heaters, I'd guess that the resistance would be in the
15-20 ohm range.
