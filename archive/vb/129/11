Hi Volks,
Just to make this perfectly clear, if you use an in computer address book to 
store Email addresses of friends and family, definitely add one to three 
letters or numbers to each Email address you store in there.  This one to 
three letter on the front or back will foil the hacker virus a##%&*(-at-)!  Then 
if your computer gets a virus and sends itself to all your friends and family 
these Emails most likely will automaticly bounce back to you.  This bounce 
back of Emails your computer sent should in turn alert you to the fact YOUR 
computer has a virus.  Some viruses will destroy your harddrive of your 
computer if left in there long enough!  So you can take care of it soonest to 
protect your computer and to prevent having to apoligise to all your friends 
and family for the virus you allowed to get and possibly destroy thier 
computers.  The second it will take to remove the extra letter/s and/or 
numeral/s from each Email address when sending an Email will pale to the time 
and trouble later.  Just like the old saying "an ounce of prevention is 
better than a pound of cure."!
