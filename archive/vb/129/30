It was about 3 weeks after installing my P.. coated
wheels, crawling along in afternoon traffic & i hear 
this sound that tells me a bad thing is about to
happen.

Two of five nuts are gone on the right frnt, the
others are finger tight. At that time I was glad for
slow traffic.

After that, I put lugs in before having them done.
