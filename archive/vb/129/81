  For bus travelers/non anal retentives, I have found the best way to route
the fuel line in to drill another hole through the drivers side bulkhead,
from there you can run a fuel line up to a remote canister filter, such as
an AC Delco, Fram (I know) or a Holly. These have real nice fuel filters in
them that are replaceable and keeps the fuel filter away from the engine
and/or electricals. I had the AC Delco in my old 62 panel and in the 4 years
I drove it never had to replace a filter. You can us a propane/LP gas valve
on the outlet of the filter to shut off to rempve engine and also as a theft
deterent.

Yeah, as John says, I run a long gas line.  I don't
coil it over the trans, though.  I coil or stretch the
extra fuel line in the left "battery tray".  Does
wonders for hot days here in the desert, because the
fuel is in the cool air flow from the left vent (NO
vapor lock) and I can sometimes pull my engine, do
what I need to do, and put it back without
disconnecting the gas line at all!

Fuel hose is cheap, and I never have a piece that's
too short.
