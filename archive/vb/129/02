I thought I'd post this to both lists as it might save a repeat bad experience

Tragic!.... SOmething I was told before I put the wheels on my vehicles,,,

BEFORE putting freshly painted rims on a vehicle,, REMOVE THE PAINT on the back of the rim where it contacts the brake part,, and from the taper area on the front, where the nut/bolt tightens on,,
This is just a small circle area 

The Reason being,....
The first hard brake application will heat up the drum/rotor enough to make the paint like jelly,, or worse,, and it will squeeze out from between the drum and the rim, and the rim and the nut/bolt
,and you rim will be LOOSE!
