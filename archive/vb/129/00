1  hinge to window frame  3.5X5mm  countersunk
2  latch to window frame   4X6mm fillister (whatever that means)
3. latch to body 4X12 countersunk chrome

Now the kicker. In the PARTS BOOK there are numerous different numbers and
lengths for certain screws that do the same thing. Some are by chassis
number some say nothing. All I can figure is that some must be oval head
slotted or phillips and or also flat head slotted or phillips, some for with
panels some without, gets very confusing. This is why I asked. Not getting
anal just trying to stock all the correct screws for the correct year and
application. I have finally found an metric screw importer that has all of
the odd ball screws in all configurations.

Hi Ronnie,

Most (if not all) of those are 4mm machine screws.... of various lengths.
However, I believe early busses (pre 59) use a sheet metal screw for the
over head fresh air vent cover (i.e. my may 59 dc has machine screws and
RobDs westy (late 58) has the sheet metal screws).  The latch screws are
varied depending on what type of latch you have.  I searched for ever for
the 4x12mm dome head screws for the latch to body screws for my 59 dc pop
out latches.  Doesn't the parts book list them?

Ronnie pondered:
  What I am looking for are the sizes of the screws that hold the hindges on
the pop out frames, the latchs to the frames, the latchs to the body and the
fresh air vent cover. The rest I have covered.
