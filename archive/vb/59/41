I've got a Right Rocker in the garage now from Schofileds and a
Rocker/Inner?Cargo Floor section from Motorworks.  Neither one seems to fit
well.  I had to drill the Combo piece apart.  When the Inner Rocker was
adjusted the Outer Rocker was off about 1 and 1/2 inches.  Now with the Set
inplace the door latches have to be move slight towards the front of the
Bus.  When kind of holding the Outer Rocker in place, neither seems to have
the correct "bend" to make the lower door gap.  I see some creative welding
coming into place.
