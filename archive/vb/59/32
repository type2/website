I just looked at the US site (had the same problems..it didnt want to
load.)

http://www.yokohamatire.com/04b3.html

is their light truck tire selection...the 370 is not listed at all.

In fact, if you run the tire selector they have, they only go back to
'88...but they show that they have NO tire for the vanagon.

Perhaps we can greymarket the 370 from canada, though, if it is still
available?  Damn good tire, IMHO.

(mind you, that's done at ones own risk..it would not be DOT
approved/legal most likely.)
