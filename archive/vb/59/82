Get the biggest compressor your budget and wife will allow.
*Minimum* 5hp 60 gal.   Don't even think of getting an oilless.
Shop around for a used one - I got my compressor used for $200
and it's served me well for several project cars.  The only
maintenance I've had to do is change the oil and replace the
starter one time.
