I replaced my inner and outter rocker with metal from ww and wasn't very
impressed with the fit/quality. I haven't used any others though so I
couldn't say how it would compare. I like por-15

Hi All-

I will soon be in the amrket for replacing the passenger side rocker (under
the cargo doors)- has anyone used the repro rocker that Wolfsburg West sells
and if so what is their opinion on its fit and accuracy?

As well the cargo floors have some surface rust on them. What would be the
easiest (and hopefully least intrusive) way of attacking this rust?

Thanks
