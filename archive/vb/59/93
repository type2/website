Subject: What is Sealing Wax Red?

Yeh, I know...it's a VW bus color. But I'm confused about WHICH red it is.

For this message, get out your new issue of Hot VW's. It's the Feb 
2002 issue and I just got mine in the mail a few days ago.

Page 62 has a story on a 1959 Panel...which is just beautiful. It 
says that this bus is painted Sealing Wax Red. But the color there 
looks more like a coral color to me. If you flip to calander 
centerfold there is a picture of a barndoor deluxe. The red that is 
on THAT bus is what I thought Sealing Wax Red was. But I've seen 
busses in person in both colors and had all the owners call them both 
Sealing Wax Red. There are definatly 2 different colors. But which is 
really Sealing Wax Red. The lighter "coral" color or the darker red 
"lipstick" color?

I know what your thinking...and yes, my wife lays my clothes out for 
me in the morning. And before I was married I just stuck with black 
clothes....man I was cool!
