David has caught me...  It should be the Y370, must have fat fingered that
one with my perty Lee press on nails again :) LOL

I could not get the US site to load so I went to Canada's site...  I cannot
verify either way that the Y370 is still available in the US.  Anyone...
Anyone...  Bueler... Bueler...

Do you mean the Y370LT?  Is it available again at long last? (looking at
that website it would appear to be, in the 195/75R14 size..hush george.:)
BUT thats a yokohama canada site.  Maybe the 370 wasnt killed in canada?
any canadians want to back this up? (and export a set to florida for me? :)

As for the Y356...blah. Drive at your own risk.
