Subject: wont start FART

Sigh, I know this has been beat to death, but know I find myself the victim
of the wont start syndrome. '66 Sundial, when I bought it, it had a 8volt
bat and a Ford relay for a hot start. 'Course I want it correct so new 6volt
bat. ditch the Ford relay, new solenoid and rebuilt starter. Wont start,it
does if I cross the solenoid, faint click as the key is released from the
start position. Trying Eric & Barbs tip, I've been cleaning the fuse box
terminals. Still no go, any thoughts ?
