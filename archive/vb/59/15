Yes, I have one, and it works great, but never choke off the valve at the
end of the hose, only full open, or full closed (you can adjust the flow at
the blaster itself), because if you don't, it washed the valve, and then it
won't shut off the sand at all. Other than that it works great, much better
than the one that sucks out of a bag (I had a sears version).

I have ran about 500lbs of sand through it, and it still works great, and
still on the first tip.
