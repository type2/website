Subject: muir's riser/rod rationale

here tis:

1971 edition, 1st printing, page 240.

he is describing throwing a rod after picking up the first printing of the
manual and selling them to book people; he muses over the recent rebuild
(10k), and found no valid reasons for the rod to go. he realizes that the
heat riser is plugeed and goes hmmmm.

"With the discovery of the plugged heat riser, the whole scene started to
make sense. Burning cold fuel causes carbon to form; excess carbon causes
the engine to run hot; heat causes the oil to stop lubricating and there
you have it. A plugged heat riser will cause a rod to burn."

not exactly kantian discourse, but it made sense to him.

i think the moral to glean is:

tis better to have a clean heat riser than not. no matter why.
