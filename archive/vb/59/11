Subject: Harber Freight Sandblaster

Harbor Freight has a 40 pound pressurized sand blaster on sale for $80.
Anyone have one or Used One?  Are they any good? I have one of their venturi
type units that sucks the sand out of a bag. It sure is slow. Is the
pressurized unit better?
Time to blast out the rust from behind the nose skin.

Thanks,
