Subject: Re: [VB] Whats this wire? (BN4 Heater)

Ark Mirvis in NJ has diaphrams. (Look in links on
vintagebus.com or on VW Planet). I think he was asking
$55.00 for them so i was going to try to fab my own
using directions from type2.com.
More than likely you diaphram is shot but try pulling
apart the fuel pump and cleaninig it out. they tend to
freeze up if not used for a while. It worked with the
ones i have!
