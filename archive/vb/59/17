Subject: re:[VB] plugged riser = burned rod coz why?

If Muir had an engine go wonky because one of the heat risers were plugged and
there after thought that plugged heat risers cause wonked engines then he may
have been correct or just suffering from what that theologic genius/observer of
comment sense, fund hucker of the stars, L.Ron Hubbard called a secondary
engram.
For example, once as a kid, I was forced to stay with an old couple who were
baby sitting me on a Winter's friday night. There house was heated to about 90
degrees in side! They forced me to eat fried cornmeal mush cakes which were
peppered with canned creamed nibblet corn. The phat-mix was covered with maple
syrup. <true story> I was then told to sit quietly and sit in front of the TV
and watch the GreenHornet and Kato Kaylin on ABC. Later that night came down
with the flu and warfed the whole mix onto their funky oldschool braided rag
floor rugs and their nasty looking mouth breathing Boston bulldog. To this very
day I have a weird reaction to old people, cornmeal, braided rugs,
miscellaneous funk, the Green Hornet and Kato Kaylin. I got over the fear of
ABC when Charlie's Angels came around. Lest we forget that Farrah was *hot*
before she got all worn out and haggard looking things of hers that look like a
mouth breathing Boston bull dog was exposed on the internet whilst exiting cars
with suicide doors. I am truly whacked but I am not a fool. <hey now!>

Heat risers? I figure that cornmeal mush and heat risers are a matter of
balance. If you block one side and not the other then you could surmise that
you will have a thermodynamic imbalance. I've seen heat risers intentionally
blocked on both sides at the exhaust pipe when used in conjunction with an
aftermarket manifold or dual intake set up with a funky header. My bet is that
Ronnie would salute you for running single intake and encourage you to run the
flaps, thermostat- properly adjusted. The cleared and clean risers combined
with the other poop mentioned in the last sentence will aid in the proper warm
up of your engine. 
Running a carb too lean due to a f'ed up accelerator pump, maladjustment of the
idle/fuel volume control screws, running an engine with an air leak from gasket
surfaces, exhaust leaks or a rust *HOLE* in a heat riser (on the
hidden-hard-to-look-at underside) could place the whammy on your true self.
Ask your self if you are sure that all of the internal carburator circuit
passages are clear. Or does the carb just look groovy and "restored" on the
outside. How do you know?
What does cornmeal mush and the father of Scientology have to do with anything?
Nothing but it makes for good humor. Just don't feed your kids weird sh*t and
make them watch black and white ABC TV in old people's homes or they might end
up like me. When John Travolta and Tom Cruise get into building buses then I
will know that it's time to get out of the bus scene for reals.
