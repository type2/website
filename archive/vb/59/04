Subject: plugged riser = burned rod coz why?

i am still tweaking the jetting on the nicely-rebuilt 30pict1 i got from
uncle jerry  ($80 ppd, see if he has more!), and i am closing in on it, but
i had a question about a muir Statement of Law, ie: plugged heat riser =
burned rod. his SOLE rationale as i recall was that one day he threw a rod;
nothing else was wrong with the motor as far as he could see BUT the
heatriser tubes was plugged. he states, hmm, plugged riser means thrown
rod, and never mentions it again.
now, first, this is clotheared syllogism of the foulest kind (that catholic
man has a beard; so all catholic men must have beards, too); second, i see,
read and hear constant references to BLOCKING OFF the riser tube for
various reasons - usually, to prevent vaporlock in hot climes.


so someone is wrong. or at least correct only under certain conditions :)


my symptom is as follows: car actually slows down when you hit the gas, and
then gradually picks up speed.
muir says 'classic plugged heatriser symptom,' but also allows as how a
wonky accel circuit would do the same. perhaps a too-small main would cause
it, too, tho i rarely hear a backfire thru the carb.
120 main, 135z emulsion, 50g idle jet; plugs are sooty on the outside ring,
clean and brown on the cone. so i'm not too far off. i'm gonna fiddle w/
the accel pump setting and see what happens tomorrow, but i really want to
know WHAT a plugged riser really does to a rod, if anything... i can drive
with a fussy accel pump, DON'T want to drive it w a doomed rod!
