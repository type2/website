Subject: Got the 1960 camper!!

Well I just got back from talking with the owner, turns out he has two of 
these 1960 SO-23s!!! This one has been sitting there for 23 years, it was 
water tight with a tarp on it till a few years ago when it got vandalized 
and he gave up on it. His other bus he took out to his friends house in the 
country so the inside is still in good condition. So he says if I take the 
bad one off his property then he will give me the nice one!! So I will have 
a good camper and a parts car, or maybe two campers if the one is fixable. I 
will borrow a digital camera to take some pics so you all can see my find.
