Subject: mcode paint finish number '2', tipper update

Hi All,

I updated briefly my 67 tipper page today... mainly to show the mcode plate
and what it deciphers out to.  The one thing that stumped me was the 2612
designation.  According to Everett's site, the 4 digit is a paint finish
code but he doesn't state what the numbers might be (or did I just not look
far enough?)

Any way, the tipper is almost finished with getting new brakes (slight snafu
with a missing master cylinder but I should have it tomorrow).  Then I can
finally drive it :-)

... oh, one more thing, I finally found some NOS original rear tranny mounts
for the 59 double cab!  woohoo.  Thanks to Glenn Miller of Bend Oregon.
