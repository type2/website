Subject: Safari window seals - Dum-Dum works!

The dum-dum 1" wide putty strips work great on my leaky safaris. No water, =
no drafts when it's applied to the body and window frame, covering the =
rubber seal on the outside. Here in the midwest of California all the rain =
falls between November and April, so I can apply it once, then pull it off =
in the Spring. It won't be reuseable unless you can use a noodle roller to =
reform the semi-gooey stuff.=20
An earlier post had a link to a cheap source. It's a body/firewall gap =
sealer most FLAPS should have.=20
