Do you mean the Y370LT?  Is it available again at long last? (looking at
that website it would appear to be, in the 195/75R14 size..hush george.:)
BUT thats a yokohama canada site.  Maybe the 370 wasnt killed in canada?
any canadians want to back this up? (and export a set to florida for me? :)

As for the Y356...blah. Drive at your own risk.
