Night and Day better, it holds 100 # of sand and will take 175 psi .
Much more force when there is pressure behind the sand, and it
doesn't take any away from the output. Forget the nozzles, they
are no good. Get a better, bigger one. It has 3 valves to control
air and sand, these wear out as well as the hose and the
sand fitting in the base. But basically a good deal.
