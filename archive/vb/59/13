Try checking with Wilfred Wilkes of the Vintage Radio Shop in Brisbin,
PA.  Phone 814-378-8526.  He specializes in repairing antique European
auto radios and might have some spare knobs that he can sell.  It might
help to have the model name of the Blaupunkt available when you call--it
should be on a sticker on the side.
