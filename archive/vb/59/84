Hi List,

I got in my '63 crewcab this afternoon, turned the
key. After about 1 or 2 revolutions, while clutch was
depressed, the truck just lurched forward all the
sudden-like like the clutch was not depressed. I then,
ever-so-gently limped it to a friend of mine's filling
station and put it on the rack thinking it was
probably a broken clutch cable. NOPE. Cable is fine.
Lots of icky, greasy crap oozing from the nose cone. I
suppose something internal has broken. Anywho, on to
my question. It is an IRS tranny that I've been going
to replace anyway because it leaks so much stuff in my
garage, or anywhere it's parked for that matter. I
would like to replace it with a freeway flyer or a
Type 3 tranny. Are these the same thing or is one
higher geared than the other. What kind of performace
should I expect if I do put in a freeway flyer? I'm
running a stock 1600 DP with single carb. Will this
combo be OK in a crewcab with stock 1600 and all that?
I'm assuming the broken tranny is a type 1 but not fo
sho. Please respond if you can help answer my
questions. I'll be checking in tomorrow for any
answers that may fly my way. Thanks everybody!! Happy
Holidays!!

Pete
'63 Crewcab - Buck

p.s. I'm having to drive my Type 3 while Buck is
broken. YUK ! (But could be worse!)   ;o)
