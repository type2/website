Subject: RE: [VB] Harber Freight Sandblaster

I bought a TIP and love it. Use it all the time. I had to upgrade my 
compressor...and even the one I have now has to work real hard to 
keep it going. But it definatly does better.

I buy sand from a place here in the industrial district. It's 
Tex-Blast Blasting Sand...Grade 4. It's only $2-$3 for a 50lb bag. 
Never clogs. Made for what I'm using it for...and it's cheap. Check 
around.
