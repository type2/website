I think your right with the mid sixties guess. You
could also run Radars with Goodyear Bluestreaks! Good
luck finding a set!
 The Cal Look book has pics of some old Bug-Ins and
early racing pics that have photos of old wheel
combos. 
 Are your american racing rims wide five (vw)? That
will look sweet! 
I haven't noticed any pics of the Dc with a heater in
it yet! :)
