Mike,

There are several explanations for the little holes.

The first and most important is that you must have a defective wheel. Cracks
can radiate from the holes and affect various components in your bus. The
cracks can radiate to important structural elements and your bus could come
apart. I suggest that you purchase a new wheel from me before you have a
problem.

The second and more  plausible explanation is that the mold contained
ejection pins for easy removal of the steering wheel from the mold.
If your  wheel looks really ratty, you should consider a new wheel anyway.

Always happy to answer questions.
