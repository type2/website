If you balance a wheel off a spare drum the wheel will 
be weighted incorrectly if it is turned on that drum or 
mated to a different drum. Just remember if you use any 
kind of adapter it must be balanced by itself first to 
be accurate.

Get a spare drum and take it with you.  The wheel can be 
mounted on the drum then the drum mounted on the machine.
