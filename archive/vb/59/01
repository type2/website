I have 15" rims on my un-lowered 63 singlecab.
I used 205/70R15's from Pep Boys, the cost was about $100.00 for all 4 wheels.
Of course you have to add for balancing, Ca Tax & disposal so it really came 
to about 150.00 for all 4 tires.
I think they are just great and use my truck as a daily driver for about 10 
miles each way.
I am still looking for a good 15 inch rim for the spare instead of the beetle 
spare that is hanging in the treasure chest. Anybody have one?
