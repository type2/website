Subject: yet more tires

I went to Goodyear to ask about 603vs. 89.00 and a week to deliver + sales
tax. Naaa.
The same tires were 66 ea +42 to ship from tire rack. 72.00 less and
approx the same delivery time.
I opted for the yoko 356s anyway which are 8$ cheaper each.
I told the guy that it was pretty weak that the dealer cant even get
competitive to the mail order price. He just shrugged. His loss.
Im going to the haitian place to get them mounted noone can balance them
anyway just to support a real small buisness.
