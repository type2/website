I have a pressure blaster also, like Rex's, TIP sells good stuff.  My "pot" 
holds almost 100#'s of sand, it's the only way to go.  As far as grits, I use 
30 grit on the real rusty stuff, and even for stripping paint. On stuff I 
want a finer finish on, I use 70 grit, but it's slow going in comparison!   
Just be sure to keep moving, and filter your air!!  Water is your enemy 
here..  You almost can't get too much air here. I use 3/4 inch line from the 
tanks to the trap and filter, then 1/2 line to the "pot".   I have two 60 
gallon 6.5 horse compressors going on mine.  Keep your airpressure low and 
you won't warp anything.  (like below 100psi)  Those big industrial blasters 
warp EVERYTHING!, I know, I have had it done to me before!! And it sucks 
trying to straighten all that metal out after they do it!  I believe the 
first name for my bus was "purple wavy hack job", for good reason, shitty 
blast job!
Good luck!
