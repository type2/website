  It's (1960 DD panel) maiden VOYAGE was to the CLASSIC weekend 1998, To bad
it's not going to make the CLASSIC this year, unless I find another driver.
Hope to bring the container van and the fire truck this year

Don't use it unless you plan to keep your bus out of the elements. PPG gives
OMNI a 5 year life span. The OMNI on my 60 DD started to powder out and go
flat after 3 years, been 5 now and it looks like a 40 year old paint job,
really makes my bus look vintage though.

Ronnie,

Paint tends to go flat really quick when you never wash that damn bus =)

Come to think of it, has the DD ever been washed?  I remember being there
for the maiden voyage of that bus......man, has it been that long already?
