gonna have to order a set now...keeping up with the Johnson's, ya know!
Everyone have a great rest-of-the-weekend!

To keep up with me you will need to:
  1.  Quit your job
  2.  Forsake your family
  3.  Give up on sleep
  4.  Have a caffeine pump installed in place of your heart
  5.  Give up on the kids ever being able to afford college (but they can do on
their own, they're strong, besides the truly educated never graduate)
  6.  Ensure that you have access to metal fabrication equipment, and someone
who can use them
  7.  Network with wonderful people, who can supply you with those rare part
needs
  8.  Zone out in transendental meditation (otherwise known as "computer time")
to refresh yourself
I was hoping for "10" things but I am drawing a blank, I probably could if I had
proper sleep (see item #3 above).

  I hope you can keep up and do not doubt that you will, I bet Norbert will
appreciate your labors.  I am leaving at the end of May for my epic adventure I
hope you are done by then so I can see the changes you have made.

        and
    Clementine
