Subject: have stuck drum, need tool

hi list, could somebody give me advice on a drum puller. The only one I
saw on eb*y was a cheapo $12 slide tool like a dent puller but with an
attachment that pulls on one edge of the drum as you slide the weight
back. Do these work good? If not, what kind is good and who sells them? I
think a giant heavy duty pulling tool with arms that grip and pull the
drum edges and the "bolt" that pushes on the spindle is probably what I
need but haven't found where to get one. thanks in advance, Chris (novice
drum puller)
