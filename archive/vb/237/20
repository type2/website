Subject: The Hoke, the poke -- banish now thy doubt

passing it on for all to enjoy....

The following is from the Washington Post Style Invitational contest that 
asks readers to submit "instructions" for something (anything), but 
written in the style of a famous person. The winning entry was The Hokey 
Pokey (as written by W. Shakespeare). 


O proud left foot, that ventures quick within
Then soon upon a backward journey lithe.
Anon, once more the gesture, then begin:
Command sinistral pedestal to writhe.
Commence thou then the fervid Hokey-Poke,
A mad gyration, hips in wanton swirl.
To spin! A wilde release from Heavens yoke.
Blessed dervish! Surely canst go, girl.
The Hoke, the poke -- banish now thy doubt
Verily, I say, 'tis what it's all about.
-- by William Shakespeare
(Jeff Brechlin, Potomac Falls)
