Hi JT,
First turn the key in the lock so as to unlock the shifter allowing the 
shifter to be shifted.  Then unscrew the screw on the front side of the 
shifter lock.  The top should slide forward and out of the dovetails that 
lock it into the bottom.  Remove the shifter locking pieces out of the bottom 
half of the lock and this should expose the mounting bolts below.  Undo these 
bolts and remove the shifter lock.  Watch out, the shifter will come loose 
and out at the same time!
  Is your shift lock an original with the VW logos cast into the top or one 
of the later repros?  The latter ones have wimpy interior locking pieces that 
require some welding to reinforce them.
