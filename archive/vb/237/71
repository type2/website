Glad you asked, Greg!  I have been driving the heck out of the '58 (now
called "Norbert") and having a blast with it.  As I talked to you about the
lowered front end and the IRS rear end conversion, I decided yesterday to
redo the whole suspension...sooooo...
Today, I jacked up Norbert way up in the air and proceeded to remove the
complete suspension, front beam, rear IRS and everything attached. I will be
rebuilding the IRS and brakes (dual circuit!) and installing a stock rebuilt
'65
front beam and have the spindles lowered.
I want to get the job completed by the end of May, so Carla and I can use it
to go camping and hit some VW events.
Again...thanks, Greg, for all that you did to get Norbert preped for the
long trip
to Oklahoma...It ran like a dream...

Also, this last week, I had the honor of meeting another list member, Tim
Johnson, his family and his '67 21-window, "Clementine" in Stillwater,
Oklahoma. Great Guy! The new safaris on his bus look fantastic! I think I'm
gonna have to order a set now...keeping up with the Johnson's, ya know!

Everyone have a great rest-of-the-weekend!
