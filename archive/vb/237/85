Subject: Spare wheel size 

The spare behind my 1966 front seats I believe is a beetle wheel - it is 4 x15
inch.  It has a horrible old crossply tire fitted.

What is the maximum size spare that you can run behind the front seat - I
tried putting a 15x5.5" wheel fitted with a 185/65/15 tyre fitted and that was
too large for the bench seat to sit properly.  Therefore  I need to get a
smaller tyre fitted, but not sure what size to go for?

Anyone got any ideas

Thanks
Paul
