Subject: Hippies- One last clarification, it wasn't them!!

Since it is Friday and all...
First of all, I do not consider myself a "hippie".
However, I do have very long hair, a long beard, I've
seen the Grateful Dead play many times, I believe
Peace is better than war, I own at least a few
tie-dyes, and I own a couple of buses, etc. But now
that my age is closer to 40 years than 30 years old, I
find my social opinions growing more and more
conservative.
But I MUST make one point to defend "hippies". 
HIPPIES ARE NOT THE ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR CUTTING OUT
THE FENDERS ON BUSES!! I have heard this accusation so
many times including this clip from the recent thread:
>>What concerns me is when the "puff, puff, pass"
party leads to a hacksaw and a pair of rear fender
wells! Dude, put down the bong, and back away from 
the split!<<
In my past I have managed an outdoor recreation
center, canoe rental, and a resident camp and I have
played guitar in a folk band. As a result, I know and
have known many "hippies". But I have never met a
"hippie" who has owned a cutting torch, welder, or a
sawzall. Never! Has anyone ?!
The people responsible for cutting out bus fenders are
the "Go-fast, look cool motorheads" who want to put
big fat Kewl wheels on there bus, NOT HIPPIES!!
Will someone please explain to me why they think that
it was the hippies who started cutting out fenders?!?!
