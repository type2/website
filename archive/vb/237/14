Subject: RE: [VB] "Bedliner" as Undercoat and Insulator

  I did my friends 64 21 window 4 years ago with a 2 part bedliner material
I got from my paint supply store. Back then it was $150 dollars for a case
of it, which mixed to 1 1/2 gallons. Barely did the underside of the bus

Hey all,

What different brands of paint-on bedliner do any of you have experience 
with using as undercoat, inner-coat, and sound-insulator in your buses?
