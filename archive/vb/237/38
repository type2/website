Quickly, before the sun goes down on Friday...

1)  Hippies, for all the bashing, kept many a bus from the crusher. 
Granted, it may have smelled a little funny afterward.

2)  Here's the URL for the latest Bentley:

3)  Wecome Robert and SO.  Sorry if reference to Bob offends.

3)  Whine du jour:  It took three months for the powder coater to do
two brake drums.

4) Any one else notice the S*t*rn commercial in the neighborhood full
of cardboard "boxes on wheels?"  Ah, perfect...until the S*t*rn drives
up.
