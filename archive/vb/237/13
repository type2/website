Subject: bus with ghia tranny hard to shift

hey all,

the bus i'm working on has a ghia tranny in it, it's really hard to tell 
where the shifter is, that is what gear your in or when you are in or out 
of a gear. this bus doesn't have an engine yet, so now is the right time 
to check, fix and change if i have to, the tranny. it has straight axles.

any advice on what i need to check, or look into, what might be the deal? 
could it just be linkage? or something internal?

thanks,
-matthew
