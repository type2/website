Subject: Re: [VB] FatMat Insulation

During spring break I tore Clementine down inside and out and I applied
FATMAT
to everything (well not everything) but a double coat over the engine, a
single
coat thougout the floor and inside the nose (so that the bugs and rocks
don't
go DING but rather THUMP) and a few spots inside the doors.  I got the
idea
from this website
http://www.nateswaterart.com/vw/camper_interior/interior_prep/ and I
think the
stuff is great and very forgiving if you happen to screw up.
