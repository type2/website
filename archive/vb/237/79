Hi people,
Are the Johnson"s and the Moore's buses planning a trip to the Bug
Blitz/Bus Blast on Memorial weekend in Kansas? Whew!
Would like to meet you bus people.
   I hope to be there, although I need to be in NM or Colorado kayaking
and mountain biking.
What type of transaxle and engine are you running?
Enjoy your buses.
