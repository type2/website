yes, for some reason it is MUCH easier to change rear shift coupler on my 65 
than it was on my early 59 or the kind with the 66 1/3 to 67 style shifters.  

The 65 I didn't have to disconnect anything but the rear coupler.   

BDs are really easy, as there is a removable cover plate, so you can reach 
from inside the bus and not get dirt in the eyes.
