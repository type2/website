If it's straight, yeah.  If it's curly it will work OK for the tail light
but not for the headlight.  The long run of curly wire will put a spin on
the electrons, so when they get to the headlight, they'll spin around in
there and come out the edges instead of coming straight out the front.  It
makes the light pattern of the headlight be real dispersed to the sides
instead of mostly straight ahead.

>How do you feel about scotch tape?

Don't tape your scotch.  If the bottle breaks, the only reasonable thing
to do is to filter the remaining Scotch through a sieve to get the bits
of glass out.  Since you no longer have a bottle, you have to then drink
the rest of the Scotch before it oxidizes in the air.

Maybe.

>Or to an idiot in the Neatherlands with a camper trailer,

I did help a guy in Belgium with his BMW motorcycle, but I wasn't joking
with him.  You could probably pull a small trailer with an R100, but I
don't think this guy had one.

The problem with most such jokes (including mine) is that this guy

weird sense of humor.
