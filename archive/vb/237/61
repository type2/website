Hi Robert,
Probably the best way to figure out which type of bus you want is to go out 
to VW meets and study the buses that show up.  Check vintagebus.com for the 
events in your area.  Most owners will be happy to show you thier bus/es!  
Yes, having more than one bus is often very helpfull.  We have found that 
having at least a single cab and a camper is a must for us.
