Since your already this close, you should head to Vallejo (under an hour 
from Cupertino) for the VW's by the Bay show / swap tomorrow (Sunday May 
4th)

Speaking of Oklahoma, I sold a '58 converted camper to a guy on the list 
who flew out and drove it home......................

I wonder how things are going with that?
