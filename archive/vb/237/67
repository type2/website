Listees,

Hehe! Made it into Cupertino CA this morning at 11am with no problems
onroute, other than an intermittent failure of my left turn signal -
prolly a bad connection somewhere. I hit major south wind west of Oklahoma
City that kept buffetting the bus until somewhere last night in the Mojave
desert of CA. Other than that, no real hassles on the way.

Love these ol' buses, eh?  ;-)
