Hi Ed,
Get a Bengal Tiger or perhaps a Grizzly Bear for a pet tied to your son's bus 
when it is parked.  ;-)
  Really what you have presently for theft prevention is about as good as one 
can go.  We know of one fellow who went to Sacramento with his completely 
restored bus with full length rack.  After the meet he went to a local 
Denny's type restaurant and when he came back out of the establishment he saw 
several guys piling into a U-Haul truck parked next to his bus.  He noticed 
the license plate on the truck had been covered up as they tore away.  The 
bus owner drove over to a close by gas station, while there filling up he 
looked up to see that his rain gutters had been bent all up and all the 
clamps to his rack were flopping loose.  It seems that the guys in the U-Haul 
had  pry barred all the clamps and had been just seconds from tossing the 
rack into thier truck!
  We always try to park our VWs in such a way as to allow us to seat ourselfs 
in a restaurant/fast food place so as to keep an eye on our ride!
