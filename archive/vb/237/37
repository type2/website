OK, don't bother with a "conversion kit"  Just buy the internal regulator
alternator, a used alternator stand from a late bug, and a alternator
style fuel pump and push rod.

The alternator will fit over a generator style fuel pump, but you won't be
able to take the fuel pump off!

If you have a 38A bus generator you will also need the fan hub for a 30A
bug generator.

The hardest part of the conversion is swapping the oil filler from one
stand to the other.  Get an internal pipe wrench to make this job easier.

Wiring is easy.  One terminal goes to the battery and the other to the
idiot light.  Basically, you just bypass the existing voltage regulator,
connecting the big wires together and the green and blue wires
together.
