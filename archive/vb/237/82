Subject: RE: [VB] Roof Rack Locks

we bought our locks at the classic last year from Rick Zavala of EZ-Locks.
The wingnut is replaced with a standard allen head bolt that has a locking
mechanism that attaches to the head.

Hiya list,
Does anyone know of a lock for the early bus racks, the ones with the
horseshoe-type clamps?  Since they have a wingnut bolt that screws down into
the clamp, I can't use the normal types of locks.
