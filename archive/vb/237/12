Subject: On labels

Volks,

I think it is unfortunate that we tend to use labels.  They are dehumanizing.
When we call people "Hippies" or any other term, we subconsciously dehumanize
them.  Labels are like pieces of paper, you can just crunch them up and toss
them away without a second thought.  We would never do that to another human
being.

That said, I am old enough to be one, but hardly.  At the time I was on the
opposite side of the political spectrum (and any other spectrum, for that
matter)  Nowdays I am not so sure.  Peoples cars, that is what VW's are/were.
Power to the people.

Have you ever noticed how you get flashed the peace sign whenever you are out
driving around in your bus?  Why?

Peace, love and Volkswagens!

Pax humanus,

Curt
