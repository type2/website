I'll probably get blasted for this, but here goes....................

If somebody wants your rack / stereo / chrome hubcaps / etc. No matter 
how well you *think* you have them secured, you will come out to your 
car some time and find them gone.

The problem with "locking" them to your Bus / Bug, is your not looking 
at the whole picture......... What's the weakest link?
The clamp itself. It's a thin guage piece of metal bent to fit under the 
lip of your rain gutter. I've personally used allen head bolts instead 
of wing bolts thinking I was smart only to have someone show me what a 
screw driver placed under the clamp will do. Leverage pops those clamps 
right off!!

Chains and cables eem like a good idea, but thet're not.........

Mr. VW Smartguy was at Pomona one time with a *CHERRY* OG westy rack on 
his Bus. He took it to the car corral Saturday and left it overnight. 
All of us were telling him, "take the rack off" But no, he says he has 
it handled. Out comes a big cable and lock that he proceeds to wrap in 
an out of the rack, etc. then under his Bus.

Cool, I guess..................

Until we roll in Sunday morning, and guess what, no rack!!!
There was a nice (cut) cable and lock there though.

Mr. Thief probably bought a bolt cutter from one of the vendors for $10


The *only* way to keep the rack on your car is to weld it on.

Just my 2 cents, and the reason my racks stay in my shop unless I'm 
using them.
