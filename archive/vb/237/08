A friend has a wierd fan that mounts to the crank where the pulley would 
normally mount. It's about 12" in diameter. There's a picture here:

It's not a very good picture, but all I got right now. It looks simular to 
the stock VW fan that goes in an upright shroud. But this one mounts where 
the engine pully goes.

Any ideas?
