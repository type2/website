Hi Matthew,
That is why we painted "40HP at work, Please Just Pass!!" on the back hatch 
of our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion.  This reduced the nasty 
attitudes of fellow drivers to the point that we have not been cut off, 
flipped off, glared at, for years and years now instead of constantly every 
day, before painting the sign.  We get tons of waves, smiles, and even a 
hystericly laughing driver passing us now and then.  Once one gal passed us 
laughing so hard she was having trouble staying in her lane!  They still do 
tailgate on rare occasion though and we just sllllooowwwllyy drop our speed 
and they figure it out and pass on by.
