"Have you ever noticed how you get flashed the peace sign whenever you are
out driving around in your bus?  Why?"

it's reflex, easier than an awkward "hi" wave, plus you don't have to know 
how to count....

"Oh by the way, after a guy gets stuck behind me on the highway at 60/65
mph for a few minutes I see the bird much more often than the peace sign."

oh so true, i can't say i'm totally used to it yet or that it doesn't 
frustrate just a little, but i'm always getting cut off, flipped off, 
glared at, tailgated...etc. so for me it's reall, REALLY, refreshing to 
see a friendly wave (any number more than one finger) by a fellow vw 
enthusiest on the highway. it somehow makes it worth it.
