I'm still giggling.  I love this list!

Obligatory bus meta-whine:  Why does my NEW throwout bearing whine just 
as much as the NEW one I put in a week ago to replace the OLD one that 
whined differently?  WTF?!?

I *think* it's the front bearing covers on these TOBs.  It's the pre-71 
kind with a grey metal carrier; the rear face and inner race are one 
piece that pops out, then there's the outer race with bearings, then a 
thin round front bearing cover that the inner race mates with to seal 
up the bearings -- all inside a cast grey metal housing (Bob Petzel 
sent pics on disassembling a different style with machined housing, but 
it's the same part number).

I think that thin cover is rotating intermittently when it shouldn't.  
It's this whirring, chirping, high moaning noise (no, AFAIK no barred 
owls in engine compartment) that I'm learning how to play Benny Goodman 
tunes with, by varying how far I press the clutch pedal.  I'm gonna 
keep driving the sucker until something explodes, 'cause I've yanked 
the engine twice over this issue.

..and no, I didn't fubar the bearing by opening it up, because the 
first new one did the same thing and I didn't tinker with it.  But I 
did notice that the outer race was slightly cockeyed in the housing 
when I removed it from the cross shaft -- but it dropped right back 
into place.  The bearing itself sounds perfectly fine when you turn it 
by hand, ie, silent.
