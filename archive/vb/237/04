sounds like a problem I have with my bus sometimes-I think waer condenses in
the fuel tank or carb or soemone inthe system, adding "drygas" to my tank
always helps. My friend with a "b*g" has the same problem in the winter,
makes pulling out into an intersection a little hairy(is it gonna stall?)
drygas I guess it somehow grabs the water in the fuel and gets it out ofyour
system. not sure how it works, but it works for me. You may need to add a
bottle through a couple tanks, to get it all out of your system.

cheap too, I think it is less than $2 a bottle.

also-as you mentioned that the filter got dirty pretty quickly, I would get
a couple filters and try to keep changing them until they are clear-if you
can't reach this stage, you may need to pull the gas tank and clean it
