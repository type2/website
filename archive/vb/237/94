Subject: Painters, ever experiance this?  (Paint trouble on DC)

Anyone ever experience this?  I painted the interior
of my DC 2 weeks ago.  Turned out great.  Paint flowed
well with only a few runs.  Painted the exterior last
weekend and man....  It defiantly did not turn out
well.  The paint went completely flat.  Everywhere. 
Not a spot of shiny paint on it.  The paint did not
flow great but i think that is because i did not put
enough on the body.  the places were it did flow it is
still flat.  

My paint shop suggested that the metal was too cold. 
anyone ever here of that before?  

(I am using PPG Acrylic Urethane, Single stage)

(I painted the bus outside in the morning like i
always do.  Same paint, same gun.  Different air
compressor but i have used this compressor before many
times.  I did wipe the body down with DX330 cleaner
but my shop says that that would not cause this.)

any ideas out there?
Thanks
Matthew
