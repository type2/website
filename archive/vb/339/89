Had to take Bill back to hosp on Sunday after 2 days home. The pain that
started this whole thing returned and it was agony for him. After a week of
dealing with Memorial, the dr and tests it has been decided that Bill most
probably (see everyone hedges) has a blood clot in his vascular system
associated with his right kidney. He also has an enlarged prostrate, and an
infection in the orginal incision, which they are draining as we speak! They
will be doing another ultrasound and MRI on the kidney area before they make
a decision to to surgery. Bill holding up as am I. Your prayers and energy
are a great help. As for the blindness...can't forget that but have to with
everything else...he is starting to see shapes and movements more and more
but color is still grey. Gets confused easily with everything that is
happening. Can't wait for his body to settle.
To the VW people who are receiving this...You have gotten the message out
and I have been receiving the most wonderful emails from around the country.
Thank you all.
Becca, Jeff and Ezra went home today. They were a great help and I was able
to spend better time doing what had to be done...whatever that was!!! Ely
calls everyday and is great joy for us both.
Keep us in your thoughts, etc.
Love to you all...
Janet
