Subject: Bus Safety, was WSJ article

A guy at the SoCal classic in June was selling crash bars for splits and bays. It mounted on the floor below the door hinges and swept forward and 4-5" up. Not sure if there was anything below the floor, but would be a better design if it had braces that fastened to the center rails somehow. 

I've seen a custom crash bar in one of the magazines that had a removeable bar that fit between the front bar and into the dogleg where it probably was mounted to the B pillar. 

Maybe it's better to put big 'roo bars up front and a spare tire if you're concerned about collisions up front.
