Subject: Any pics of original Westfalia trailer hitch ?

Hi
Is there a website that shoes an original Westfalia trailer hitch / tow ball 
for an early bus ?

Someone is trying to sell me one , but he is not really sure if its a 
Westfalia one, so I need to send him some pics to compare

thanks for your help
