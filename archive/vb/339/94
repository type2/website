Subject: Re: [VB]hard start... 30/31 question

I had problems starting my green bus (65 westy) it would not start when 
hot...was fine around town,  got worse and worse.  It'd alway work with a jump wire 
straight from starter to battery, but not with key.  I cleaned connections, 
etc etc then put a hard start relay in a couple years ago.  this summer it got 
worse enough that the hard start relay didn't even work sometimes... and I had 
to be push started a couple times.  It got real old real quick.

  Then I just got a new starter, and installed it , leaving the hard start 
under the bus, but not hooking it up.   Bus starts.   Guess I could have just 
replaced the starter years ago.
