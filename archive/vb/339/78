Subject: John Brown's Buses... Northwest Carabus departs 9AM Friday

Hi Volks,

This is a reminder about the carabus heading from Northwestern New York 
state down to Harper's Ferry West Virginia for John Brown's Buses on 
Friday October 15th, 2004.


Here's the timeline:

8:30 AM - Buses start gathering outside the gate of Lake Erie State 
Park near Brocton. Be sure to top up the fuel tank and empty your 
personal bilge tanks beforehand please.

9:00 AM - We roll west on Route 5. It's slightly slower than the 
interstate, but there aren't any tolls and the scenery is spectacular.

9:45 AM  -Turn Left and head south on I79

11:30AM - Take exit 228 turning East onto 70/76 to pick up the Penna 
Turnpike. There'll be a fuel stop somewhere in the next hour or so, 
which will also be used for a brief meal break. I can't vouch for the 
quality of the restaurants on the penna turnpike, I plan to bring a 
cooler with a brown bag lunch already packed.

2:00 PM - Exit #161 takes us off the Penna Turnpike at Breezewood, 
continue south on I-70. Be prepared to pay the tolls.

2:45 PM - Head East on I-68

3:30 PM Head South on I-81 to exit the interstate at Martinsburg. From 
there we travel on secondary roads about 15 minutes to Harpers Ferry. 
The total distance for the trip is just under 400 miles, so I'm 
expecting to get there on 2 tanks of fuel. If your bus regularly gets 
less than 14 MPG please schedule a tune-up, release your parking brake 
or unload some cargo.


Notes:

Speeds in this group will average at about 55-60 MPH. There are some 
VERY long hills on the Penna Turnpike and on I-70 south of Breezewood, 
and I don't want to damage anyone's engine. I have a CHT gauge in my 
bus and drive accordingly. We might hit 65 on the downhills, or if we 
luck into a strong tailwind, but otherwise I'll be holding back to 60 
MPH.

If anyone has information about road conditions or route suggestions 
I'd be very happy to hear about them. I haven't driven this route since 
returning from EveryBus in April.

My Dad's cell phone is on an international plan, so if you're planning 
on linking up with us mid-route I'll give you his number. My own 
carrier charges an obscene amount for international roaming, but since 
it's supplied by my employer I'm stuck with it.

Bring a camera for your co-pilot, the scenery and fall colours will be 
well worth it.

Only 14 days to go... Please email and let me know if you're interested 
in joining the group.

Happy trails,
