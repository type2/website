Hi Volks,
We view those hard-start relays as a bandaid!

Notes to self: 
1.> <sigh> Remember why you quit posting to the VintageVW list. 
2.> Please note Eric&Barbs collective penis is bigger that yours.
3.> Hard start relays in addition to all of the other clean connection aspects
that "Eric&Barb" mentioned always worked for you. 
4.> Long <hot> wires all the way forward to ignition switch and ALL of the way
back to the starter was a sh*t design. Headlights, tail lights and everything
else electrical were/are on separate circuits. Remember electrical basics.
5.> Muse about differece between hotter than hell Arizona desert driving and
eternally wet PNW driving.
6.> Return to F150 with 192,000 miles on odo and leave the aircoolers to
themselves. Go back to lurking/cloaked mode. Quit giving a crap about others
and stay to self.
