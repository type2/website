Subject: re:wouthwind switch needed

Hi Bob et al....,

I had a similar situation with mine...I found something on the samba-for a
decent price ~$40 I think, a 6V SW heater. It isn't complete, but it has one
of the switches. I don't think the cabling and stuff is right for a bus. I
was going to get it, and try to modify the switch. Or some folks suggested
just getting another switch-I think a wiper switch and on/off switch would
work.

Luckily for me I found a complete setup on ebay-just before I bought those
pieces. Well they told me it was complete-I'll let you guys know when it
arrives and I get it installed.
