For electrics, make sure that you have the hard-start relay installed on your
starter. (see archives). Resistence build up, as mentioned, may be a
contributing factor in "hard starting" conditions. Otherwise check carb and
timing issues. 

Double check basics of timing and float level. Where is your (carburator's)
accelorator pump set? Are you running too LEAN? Have you followed the basic
instructions as provided by the sheet that came with the carb OR the Muir book?
