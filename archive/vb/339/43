Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Noise with Load

Cal,

One thought is that the problem is temperature related:  after driving
at highway speeds for 30 miles, your engine is finally fully warmed up
and at peak temperature, and that's when the problem begins (roughly
the same for me).

I'm still thinking that my problem might be related to a loose head.
This could follow with the "when at normal operating temperature"
argument if expansion is somehow to blame.

I'll still check my endplay to determine if its potentially a flywheel
issue (but that will be hard to determine given that the engine has
0.030"+ of endplay already and is merely a spare to get me around for a
while).

But yeah, sure is weird.

Otherwise: quick sanity check question: have you checked/changed your
tranny oil lately?

Cheers,
	Tom
