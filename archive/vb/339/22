Passed a  a white/grey Singlecab splitty this Tuesday while headed to 
Dulles Airport on 15 S (coming from Western Maryland).

I was pulled over on the side letting my '67 freedom camper (white, VA 
plates) cool down for a minute or 5 after the long run down I-68/I-70.

Waves were exchanged.  Was it anybody on the list?

So good to be back in a bus...
