Subject: Parts and Help on the Big Island: HAWAII

Hello Listees, I am a resident of the Big Island and have been an avid
collecter of bus parts for years, mostly Bay window stuff, but I have a
front axle beam from a 1966 split that needs a new home. Just the beam,
no king or linkpins or spindles. It's clean,low rust and I can deliver
it anywhere on the island. Also have some new , used and NOS parts for
all vans 1966-1979 ; lenses, latches, handles, rubber, tuneup supplies,
etc. Give me a call , Tim 808-887-2027 ( toll free on the Big Island )
