Hi Volks,
Could also be electrical related.  When the engine is warm it takes  more 
amperage to turn the engine with the starter which reduces the electrical  power 
to the rest of the VW.  Because of this the coil might not be getting  enough 
voltage to preform properly and easier to drown the spark plugs in  fuel.
