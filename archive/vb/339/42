Tom,


After reading all of your post again (hadn't noticed the bottom part), it
sounds like you're describing something that my bus has been beginning to
do also. For me, it's only happening in 4th after approximately 30 miles
of driving at highway speeds (55-63). A loud knocking starts which seems
to be coming from mid-rear center under the floor. It kinda creeps up
slowly, then it's loud. When I disengage the clutch, it's gone. If I
reengage the clutch it starts right up again. I've checked all the usual
and sensible things,  like you've done. My FW endplay is spot-on (.004),
with no noticeable wiggle, TO bearing's fine. Replaced the entire clutch
assembly at one point (TOB, PP, disc). Mounts are fine, etc etc.

I'd like to know what' up as my bus currently has a range of 30 miles,
which means I can't drive across the country this holiday season. Heck, I
can't even get out of the Bay Area! Around town and short drives, it's all
perfectly fine. Wierd!
