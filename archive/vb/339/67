I haven't done the WW seat covers, but I did some TMI "vintage series" for
my old 64 Deluxe last year (very nice!). The driver seat fit excellent, but
the passenger side (bench seat) seemed a bit 'loose' and I ended up pulling
a bit extra around the back to fit good. Used up all the wifes good metal
coat hangers to us as rods in the edges which worked out quite well.
