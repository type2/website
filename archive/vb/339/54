Subject: 30/31 question

The ongoing tinkering with the braz. 30/31 I have on my stock sp 1600 
continues.  Looking for some possible reasons for a reluctance to start 
when it is warm.  The motor runs great( although I think it is too 
rich), but does not like to start hot.  I have to hold the throttle WO 
and then it barely comes to life.  Its like its flooded.  

I've removed it multiple times and cleaned it(BTW it is only a year old 
with 3K on it) and gone up and down with main jet sizes from 112 all the 
way up to 128....there seems to be no siginificant difference.  At one 
time this thing ran perfect.

Main now is 120
Air correction is stock (not sure the size)
idle #1 is 55
idle #2 is 65

Running stock 62 air cleaner and have compufire

Any ideas?


Steve
