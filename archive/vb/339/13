Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Safety, was WSJ article

   Back in 1970 I had my first run in with a bus. I was driving my 69 International Scout looking for my dog at 5 mph 
(5:30 a.m. ). Coming the other way was a guy in a split bus doing approx 20 mph (police report stated). We were 
both hugging the center line and when we saw each other it was to late. My left front corner hit his left front corner, it 
folded the headlight assembly and clutch pedal over his foot pinning it down. When the fire department got there (with 
in 5 minutes) they cut the whole left front off the bus off with the huge metal shear and then cut the brake pedal to get 
his foot out. It was amazzing watching the tool make mince meat out of the bus.
  So after experienceing this mishape I don't really feel that the internal crash bar would do any good.
  Some where in my 35 year old photo albums I have pictures of this, but it never stopped me from wanting a split 
window bus.
