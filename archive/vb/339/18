"If your car is properly maintained, with good brakes and steering,
  clean windshield, lights and wipers that work and all that, then
  your safety is a direct function of what you are -- what you are
  being as you whistle down the road.  If we all constantly drive as
  if we were strapped to the front of the car like Aztec sacrifices
  so we'd be the first thing hit, there would be a helluva lot less
  accidents."  John Muir, Idiot manual.
