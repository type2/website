Hello Steve    The most common problem is the check valve bleeding over , 
which would cause it to flood.  Also check and make sure that you aren't getting 
gas in your oil. The check valves on the new carbs haven't been worth a damn 
and you might be better off using an ols OE solex one.  To check take the top 
off the carb remove the 5 screws and turn upside down , then blow into the gas 
inlet tube, if you can blow into it then the check valve is leaking  later and 
have fun  mark Dearing
