One last post in case any one else was interested...

Thank you to those who helped me clear off a few items :)
I have to clear out my 'extra room' to make it an actual 'guest room' and have
a few nice items I have collected that someone here may like.
books, models, posters (repro), vintage Life magazine ads (real)

I am more interested in moving things out than making a buck off fellow
listees... so please email me if anything looks interesting to you.

I also have a few random parts available that I bought new to do tune ups (a
few years back) but don't need now :( No point in selling them - if you can use
'em, drop me a line & I'll mail them to you.
4) bosch super spark plugs #7502
1) bosch condensor #02 069
1) bosch distrib rotor #04 033

ok, best for last - Vintage Camping Cooler - "Little Brown Chest". Decent
condition, with insert tray, aluminum inside & circa 50's. Pretty darn heavy,
might just want to pick up in person. Photo available soon. I think it's
awfully cute & looked nice in the back of my bus! Some rust, not mint, but
nice. Make offer.

thanks
melissa
