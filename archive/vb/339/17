Subject: jerome, maintenance

prior to jerome my beetle complained that i never take it anywhere.  it had a brand new generator/regulator and though not a bus, i thought why not and how bad can a black car be in the desert anyway?  i wasn't ostracized for having a non-bus at a bus event though riding in a black beetle through the desert is hot and so are vinyl seats!  my beetle ran pretty good except for some minor problems when the engine became hot and a puncture/slow leak received on one of the off-road trips we'd taken.  my beetle has only two gauges, a red and a green one, so i am not sure how hot the engine was but it was hot enough so that i'd not want to handle the oil dip stick, though the green gauge didn't altert me to trouble.  the puncture was repaired in flagstaff after jerome and prior to following j.p. back to albuquerque.

once in town, i've been helping j.p. with repairs and maintenance on his hoard of buses; i also rewarded my beetle with some maintenance.  one of the things i've done to my beetle is to replace the fuel line.  during the hours traveling along the road i realized that the fuel line was between eight and 10 years old plus about 10,000 miles.  what was interesting is that the fuel line in the engine compartment was in pretty good condition considering.  however the fuel line with the transmission was in terrible condition, in one place worn through the cloth and into the rubber and totally deteriorated at least an inch in from the cut end.

after feeling pretty bad about the negligent maintenance to my beetle, i put three full tubes of grease into the front beam of a '58 single cab j.p. bought more than a year ago.  i guess all the years in the desert turned the original german grease to dust or something.  i told j.p. that i felt absolved of my maintenance negligence.
