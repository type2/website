Hi,
I am new to this list. I own a couple of type 2 and a friend of mine is
restoring a 56 panel and he want it as stock as possible (his choice). I
probably will have some questions in the future about that projet. My first
one is about the rear bumper splash pan. Is the bumper splash pan was only for
the deluxe or for the full line bus including the panel?
