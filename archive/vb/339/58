Subject: On-line purveyors of mirrors and linkages

Greetings All,

Finished painting my 62 twin cab and will put up
update photos soon.

I'm reassembling and need a couple of bits I'll have to buy
on-line from one of the US vendors...

I need a couple of external mirrors and arms (prefer round,
stainless steel, slightly OS pin would be good) and a good
steel hex bar linkage....

A good place to buy both?  Aircooled net has good linkages
(so Aussies who've bought em tell me) but only seem to offer
the VWOA elephant ear style mirrors (anybody bought these care
to comment on quality???).

Thanks

RobK
