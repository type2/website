Subject: Re: [VB] Elastic cord and crimper ring source?

for my 65 westy, I bought the thin bungee cords from a marine (boat) supply 
store, pretty cheap actually. used wire to tie the ends.  not as nice as 
crimps.. but having the bungees is really nice.. keeps the curtains tiday and 
against the walls.
