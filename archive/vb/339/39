Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Noise with Load

My engine made similar sounds. Turned out to be loose flywheel on the
crankshaft. After pulling the engine see if you can make the flywheel wobble
while prying with a screwdriver. I first thought it was end play but then
measured it. It was more than 30 thousandths of an inch! Then I found that I
could rock the flywheel back and forth. The gland nut was loose! I know I
torqued it good and gave it plenty of lock tight. The four pins holding the
flywheel to the crankshaft elongated. I replaced the flywheel, crankshaft
and 4 pins. If yours is loose, you might try redrilling the crankshaft and
flywheel for 8 pins instead of replacing them.

"Listen to the motor. Listen to the wheels. Listen with your ears and with
your hands on the steering wheel; listen with the palm of your hand on the
gear-shift lever; listen with your feet on the floor boards. Listen to the
pounding old jalopy with all your senses; for a change of tone, a variation
of rhythm..." - John Steinbeck _The Grapes of Wrath_
