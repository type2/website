Subject: Re: [VB] On-line purveyors of mirrors and linkages

Wow... I just installed new mirrors and found the way they vibrate kind of
annoying... I thought it was just me.  In any case, it's easier to see now
that my mirrors have one piece of glass instead of several broken ones with
chunks missing.  But I did stick some of those little round convex mirrors
to them - for some reason the vibrating effect isn't noticeable when looking
at them.
