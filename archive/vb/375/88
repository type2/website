Subject: Re: [VB] Polished or chromed empi's...?

I have my Gliseren cleared (por 15) polished 5 spokes on my 64 for 6 years,  
and all I have to do is hose them off and they still look very good. I have  
dealt with the chrome rims a lot and they seem to rust faster then you can  
polish them. I haven't clear coated the chrome yet but I'm sure it would be just  
as effective.
