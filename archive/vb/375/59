I have the same situation. A new tank and new sender installed before I 
bought the bus. The sender is grounded to the body with a separate 
wire. Power to gage works. I ran a new wire from the sender to the 
gauge, outside the bus as suggested, and it still reads full when the 
key is on. R when key off, or sender wire disconnected.


The only thing I can think left to do without dropping the engine to 
replace the sender, is to remove the bolts on the sender and make sure 
the warning label tape at the top is the sender was removed when 
installing the sender.

If I back out the bolts, do I need to worry about anything?

Thanks,

Mark
