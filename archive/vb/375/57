Loosening the generator strap and pulling the generator aft seems to have done the trick and I found that the tin that is over the #1 cylinder and the doghouse were cockeyed. The doghouse was sitting on top of the tin over #1 and they were kind of crisscrossed. I had to pry them apart so thew would sit right. Thanks for the help
