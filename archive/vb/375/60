Hi John,
We would check the voltage at the battery (have you cleaned those  recently?) 
and how much voltage is getting to the coil.  Do a full tune up,  and 
possibly take the carb apart for a cleaning.  We have had same problem  due to worn 
starter bushing, even though the starter turned over well and  long.
