 however could you measure the clearance
inside the rear hatch? I am always on the lookout for units produced by
Kamper Kits. Their hallmark is enough space through the hatch, tipped up at
the diagonal, for an american sheet of plywood at 4 feet wide (1.22 meters).
I believe that all other manufacturers had wide closets on the passenger
side which precluded that utility.



Clearance is over 4 feet.  I had to measure from inside the bus, with all
the camping stuff in place but neither side cupboard intrudes into the rear
hatch area.  There must have been a sliding shelf at some time which I
presume slid forwards to make the bed.  I have removed the brackets etc. as
this was missing so at present I have about 53" clear opening.  Hope this
helps.
