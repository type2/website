Subject: P&C's?

On my 63 Panel with what I think is a stock 40hp single port engine, I wanted to do a ring job due to plug on cylinder #4 getting extremely wet with oil thus fouling the plug and running on three cylinders. Now I know there could be other issues but I thought I'd start there, anyway, my question is a 2 parter; 

1st: Can I upgrade the size of the cylinders without splitting the case and leaving all rotating components stock?

2nd: Does anybody have suggestions on a vendor and or specific product?
