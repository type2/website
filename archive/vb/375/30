Well I finally sorted it all out.
I did check out my speed on the freeway and my 63 singlecab does 55 mph (-at-) 4000 PRM
So I need to cruise no faster than this and maybe ease up to 60 mph occasioanally.
The speedo guy did it right!
 
When I get to replace the 40 HP engine with a 1600 DP that I have from the thing, I will consider putting in a freeway flyer top gear.
 
Yes, because it is the one year 1-ton option it has a small nut tranny, even with 15 inch wheels and 205 15 tyres it is a working truck not a freeway flyer!
