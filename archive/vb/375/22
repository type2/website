1) Do a compression test.   Make sure it isn't a bad plug wire or distributor 
cap.

2) check the end play... turn the engine to TDC and push/pull the crank 
pulley.   The play should be about .003" to .006", with a wear limit of about 
.010"... a thick hair.  It is goes clunk clunk the bottom end bearings are worn.

3) sometimes the 40hp cases are actualy previously bored out to big bore 
40hp, which is a 1500.

4) with the bottom end in good shape, I have rebuildt the top end (new rod 
bearings. rings, rebuildt heads) and put many miles on.  However, this was with 
a good bottom end, not w/ worn out main bearings.

5) read your Muir Idiot book chapter on rebuilding an engine.   It has some 
stuff in there about checking wear, too
