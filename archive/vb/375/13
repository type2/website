Hi,

Don't know anything about the bus, however could you measure the clearance 
inside the rear hatch? I am always on the lookout for units produced by 
Kamper Kits. Their hallmark is enough space through the hatch, tipped up at 
the diagonal, for an american sheet of plywood at 4 feet wide (1.22 meters). 
I believe that all other manufacturers had wide closets on the passenger 
side which precluded that utility.
