Why the mileage restriction?  I can think of two things, but I'm not
sure if either of them are right.

1.  The rings will have "bored out" the cylinders a tiny bit over the
     length of their normal travel.  Putting shims under the cylinders
     means that when the pistons approach bottom dead center, the rings
     are suddenly traveling over an area that hasn't been bored out.
     They express their displeasure with this situation by running and
     hiding in the sump.

2.  Valve/rocker geometry problems - it has worn in with a slightly
     different pushrod length.
