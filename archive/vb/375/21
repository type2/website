That registration number is too recent, 5AFN370 would be near the 
beginning of 2003.
I brought my 21 window from Washington to California in Jan 2003 and 
they gave me a number
starting with 5A.  So one of two things happened - the owner stopped 
paying registration fees
at one time and when they re-registered they got the new number, or like 
mine, it originally
came from somewhere other than California.
http://www.calpl8s.com/ gives more history on the California license 
plate schemes.

Also check out the bus registry on vintagebus.com

Cheers,
Tom.
