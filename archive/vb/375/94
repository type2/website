Subject: Re: [VB] Polished or chromed empi's...?

Hello John,

    I have given up on chrome wheels too because of the rust problems! But I
have learned that you should "never" polish wheels or anything else chrome
for that matter. Polish is abrasive and gets into the pores of chrome and
"promotes" rust! I use Windex or something like it to clean, and then apply
a thin coat of "wax" for protection.
    I use McGuire's (check spelling) products with good results.
    Hope this helps.

Howard
