Subject: a light in the engine compartment...

Hi all,

I too added a light inside my engine compartment for roadside repairs.  
I located an extra stock Bus ceiling dome light assembly about two or 
three inches forward of the rearward end of the ceiling of the engine 
compartment.  I ran the power line (fused) over to the positive battery 
terminal. Now if I want to do a roadside adjustment/repair in the dark, 
I just open up the engine deck lid and reach up and turn on the stock 
dome light for illumination.  Works great and appears very "stock" 
looking although we all know better.  I only had to drill two small 
holes in the ceiling.  A great compromise!

Happy New Year to us all!
