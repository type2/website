Subject: Removing wiper motor switch...

Hello all,

  I was wondering if anyone had a successful method for removing the dash
mounted wiper motor switch.  The knob screws off but that still leaves me
with a post and only two very small holes on the side of the post to unscrew
it?  I don't want to damage that sucker too much.?  Most of the other ones
have a bottom screw anchoring them..

  Any help is appreciated.

Aloha,   J.D.
