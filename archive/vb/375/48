Subject: retorque of case?

I have the mexi-block out of the bus right now fixing an oil cooler leak.

The engine has about 80k miles on it and still runs great with that one
exception about the leak. I am going to check the case & head torques while
it's out and wondered what people suggest about a procedure for this. I know
that I put some lock-tight on the threads to keep them set on the head. The
case nuts seem to have had some sort of liquid applied to them as well from
the factory.

Should I break torque and loosen them first then re-tighten, or
just put the torque wrench on and check them?
