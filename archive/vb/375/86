You really need the yoke tool that straddles the post to access the
two holes to unscrew the face. In lieu of this, a couple of small
screwdrivers or ice picks can be used.

   I was wondering if anyone had a successful method for removing the dash
 mounted wiper motor switch.  The knob screws off but that still leaves me
 with a post and only two very small holes on the side of the post to unscrew
 it?  I don't want to damage that sucker too much.?  Most of the other ones
 have a bottom screw anchoring them..
