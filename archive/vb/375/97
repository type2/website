Subject: manual on auction site

I have lurked here for years gleaning valuable info from you guys to keep my
busses on the road.  The last of the breed has left the stable so I am
selling the book.  It is on that auction site under item # 8027014378.  Just
thought you volks would want to know.  Thanks again for all the incredible
help.
