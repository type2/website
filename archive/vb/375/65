Subject: dumb question: is there an "easy" way to lower compression?

Hi,

A super dumb question.

There's an engine I'm interested in - but the compression is 8.5:1.  
Is there a relatively easy way to drop it down to 8:1 or lower? I've  
heard you can add "spacers" but this seams problematic to me.

Conrad
