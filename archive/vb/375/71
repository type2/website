Hi Matt,
#1 would be correct.  Even if the oil rings did not grenade into tiny  pieces 
by being run into a small cliff, it might break into at least two  pieces and 
score up the cylinder bore (BTDT).  Even if the oil rings do not  break, they 
will not seal again properly.  Thusly turning the engine into  an amazing oil 
burning machine.
