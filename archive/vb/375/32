I will post you sime pics of the light that my daughter (claralw(-at-)aol.com) added to my 63 singlecab.
It is an interior light that is wired in to the rear lights. So in the dark when I have the rear lights on I can switch on a light in the engine compartment.
 
It is simple, easy to use and looks original!

I have yet to actually do this but.... I know that later model GM trucks have a little pull out light that can be used and hangs from the hood. I think a pick-n-pull would have those for cheap. Worth a shot.
