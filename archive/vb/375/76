I wouldn't reuse the cylinders if they had much use.  I also would not 
reuse them if I was removing spacer shims in order to increase 
compression.  Still, there will be no "top ring groove" issue when 
pushing the cylinders away from the block.  There will be no groove to 
break the top ring at the top of its travel.  That groove will now be 
above the top ring.  The oil control, bottom, ring doesn't seem to cause 
much wear at the bottom of its trip down the cylinder.  That would be 
the only issue that I can think of in a not so newish cylinder.   Throw 
out old pistons and cylinders!  Gary Gibson
