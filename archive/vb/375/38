Subject: Gas Guage, Horn?

Hey y'all out there in Bus land,

                  A couple of questions on my 63 Panel before the new year. First, with a new gas tank float (VDO) and brand new VDO guage, why does my gas guage always read full?
 Secondly, my horn doesn't work, I replaced both the ground and power wire, have a brand new Bosch 12V horn and checked the wiring diagram to make sure everything was good there and still horn no worky. It looks like the brass disc under the button is good. The only thing I could think of is that the brass disc is somehow not contacting the brass sleeve that the ground wire mounts in, the top of the sleeve looks a little damaged. Has anybody seen this before?
