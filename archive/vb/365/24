Subject: Rear sway bar/camber compensator

Does anyone have direct experience with both of these items?
I was always of the opinion a camber compensator was required
for use with a swingaxle trans, essentially a bar which clamps
to the axle tubes and pivots under the center section of the trans.
Lately I have seen a rear sway bar offered. In particular, an
Empi 7/8" bar, which clamps to the axle tubes but mounts to the
body with feed-thru u-bolts, plates, and bushed clamps.
Any techno info greatly appreciated.
