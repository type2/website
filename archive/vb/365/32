Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel pump rebuild seal ? 

Hi Adrian,
We have bought at Shuck's a black paper gasket material for exhausts that  
works fine in fuel situations.  You might need to lay sand paper down with  grit 
up on a flat piece of glass (wing window work well) and sand the bottom of  
the fuel pump top flat.
  The rubber gaskets that come in the WW rebuild kits do not  work.
