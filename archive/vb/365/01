Subject: switch to porsche pulley

I've been trying to follow this pulley swap for a while now...has anyone
tried this on a 6V generator? I believe the offset for a 6V is different
than for a 12V. 

Also I went to pap-parts.com, and there are a few options on the pulley's.
There is an inner and outer half sold separately(total around $25.20) or an
outer pulley half "for 11 blade fan" $16.95. Also do I need a pulley hub-or
is the stock 6v one the same? 

Suggestions on which one to get....


Thanks,

-Kevin
