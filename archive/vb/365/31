Subject: Re: [VB] Starter bushing fits loosely--a problem?

Hi Richard,
Get a new bushing.  Even if you could glue it into place.  It  might be so 
badly made that the ID does not center up in the tranny bore and  allow the 
innerds of the starter to rub and short out either now or later with a  little 
wear.
