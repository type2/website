i've got a 65 s/c that is listed by the siftung folks as may 5 - 11, 
1965 (same as me); however, the vin plate seems to decode as a 64. 
but tranny number points to mid-65, so take all the 'birthdays' with 
a small grain of salt.  we had a 50 ch*vy 1/2 ton with the original 
motor according to p/o... the motor had been built in early 46. did 
it sit around waiting for domestic truck production to catch up to 
war-production  motor stock, or did p/o lie? did siftung make a 
mistake, or did vw make a vin plate before building the truck?
gonna get dave mayes over one day, and go over every bolt looking for clues :)
