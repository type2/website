Subject: hot wire at light switch

Hi guys, 

I've had problems with my lighting for a long time...6V, 1965 Kombi.

I've noticed that the black and white wire at the headlight switch gets
really hot when the lights are on....hot enough that I'm surprised the thing
hasn't melted yet.

According to my wiring diagram this wire goes to the brake light switch...am
I reading the diagram correctly? I assume if the wire is really hot-that the
wire has a bad connection somewhere, right? Maybe it is cut somewhere? Is
the brake light switch on the back of the master cylinder?

Thanks for any suggestions...
