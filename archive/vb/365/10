If you use the tube connecting to the air cleaner besides reduced
emissions, it also creates negative crankcase pressure to prevent oil
leaks from overpressure. If you use the tube, you will suck unfiltered
outside air if you don't use the rubber nipple below.

 works with regards to the long tube with the rubber nipple that empties
 below the tin and the tube connecting to the air cleaner. Are they both
 required?
