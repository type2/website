Subject: Fw: : DD-214 on line for Vet's

Sorry this doesn't have VW content, however I thought this important enough
to attempt to circulate to reach Vet's and military retiree's in the group.
My "bust" if I'm wrong,

Subject: FW: DD-214 on line for Vet's
Info - you can now access your DD-214 on-line. Please pass this information
on to retired military personnel you may know.

Pass to Every Vet - MILITARY RECORDS
The National Personnel Records Center has provided the following website
for veterans to access their DD-214 online:
http://vetrecs.archives.gov  http://vetrecs.archives.gov . This may be
particularly helpful when a veteran needs a copy of his DD-214 for
employment purposes. Please see the details below.
The National Personnel Records Center is working to make it easier for
veterans with computers and Internet access to obtain copies of documents
from their military files.
Military veterans and the next of kin of deceased former military members
may now use a new online military personnel records system to request
documents. Other individuals with a need for documents must still complete
the Standard Form 180 which can be downloaded from the online web site.

The new web-based application was designed to provide better service on
these requests by eliminating the records center's mailroom processing
time.

Also, because the requester will be asked to supply all information
essential for NPRC to process the request, delays that normally occur when
NPRC has to ask veterans for additional information will be minimized.
Veterans and next of kin may access this application at
http://vetrecs.archives.gov
