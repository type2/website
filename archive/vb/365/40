Hi Mike,
We had similar failure in just 20 miles once when we installed larger lower  
"D" pulley.  This made the belt rid in a lower/smaller diameter area  of the 
upper pulley where surface rust coated the surface.  Result was the  rust 
sanded and then shredded the belt.  So we sanded the surfaces smooth  and had no 
more problems.
