Subject: Oktoberbus 2005 site pix and a proposal

http://www.crazyauntiesherry.com/Oktobus/Images/

Yes, a shameless plug for Oktoberbus 2005.  Here are some pictures of 
the new site.  The owner is delighted to have us and we anticipate the 
site being available for bus events almost any time we want to hold one 
there.

If anyone is interested in coming down to check out the site in person 
and maybe putting in a few hours honest labor for reduced per-bus rates 
in the future, let me know and we can get a working campout together.   
I propose one the last weekend of September, I'll be going over during 
the weekdays to do other projects but there are a few that need many 
willing hands.

The site is easy to get to, less than 10 miles off I-77, only 2 turns 
after you get off the highway.

If you're interested, p-mail me.
