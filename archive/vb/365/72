Subject: Single Cab Side Gates For Sale in Northern Ohio

I have a set of decent solid single cab side gates
(pair of sides only) that I was saving but new
projects force sale for $$ and room.

They are very solid, really no rust just some surface.
 Lots of dings and dents they were used obviously. 
$300 for the pair..I am in Toledo email for my phone #
