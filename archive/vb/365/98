Kevin,

It could that the Bl-Wh wire is corroded and acting as a resistor. That
would cause the heat and drop the voltage, leading to dimming of the 
headlights. You could measure the voltage drop across that connection
if you have a multimeter to test this theory, or just replace the wire
with an equally thick one.

Good luck,
Richard
