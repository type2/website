Subject: More Porsche Pulley = 50F+!

The results are in!

The Porsche pulley conversion lowered head temps by 50+ degrees F at idle!!!

I took it for a small test drive, but not a long open road cruize so I can 
only report on the idle temp difference.  Granted I think this will be 
representative of the loaded down values as well.  So I have gone from 350 
idle to 275-300 idle :)

If it stays under 450 on the open road I guess that will be good enough.

Again this is running a 15345 belt with a Porsche top pulley and 6 3/4" 
bottom Equalizer pulley.

Also I switched to NGK plugs and it sounds a lot nicer that the Bosch plugs. 
  IMHO the NGKs are the only way to go, as Faster Laster stated a while 
back.

Also to note I ended up with two 15345 belts and really like the Dayco brand 
which is made in the USA (PepBoys and Advance parts stores) versus the 
Mexican made belt I bought at AutoZone.  Big difference in finish level.

I imagine oil temps will be cooler as well, but has not been an issue for 
the motor so far anyway.  Just goes to illustrate oil temp and head temp are 
unrelated.

Take Care,
