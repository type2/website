Subject: Re: [VB] hot wire at light switch

If it is the wire connected to terminal 56 of the light switch check you high 
beam switch on the floor. Could be bad connections or bad switch.

That wire carries all the current for the headlights and is NOT fused(unless 
you count the main harness as a fusible link).

 I've noticed that the black and white wire at the headlight switch gets
 really hot when the lights are on

 According to my wiring diagram this wire goes to the brake light switch...am
 I reading the diagram correctly? I assume if the wire is really hot-
 that the wire has a bad connection somewhere, right? Maybe it is cut 
 somewhere? Is the brake light switch on the back of the master cylinder?
