Eric,

Just what gas mileage do you get? What is the engine size in your westy?

In theory, changing the carbs should not reduce the engine efficiency, but
improve it. Its all got to be in the set up!!

Your westy must be fuel injected. How does one check the air/fuel mixture on
a carb system? Is an oxygen sensor up the tail pipe any use?
