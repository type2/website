Subject: 63 12v blinker hookup

Hi all. I have broke down and converted my earrrly 64 SC to 12v. All works but my turn signals flash rapidly so I thought I should change the 6v relay. The 12v one I have is the 3 prong with 49 49a and 31 terminals. How can I make this 1 work or do I need another. The 6v one that was on there is a wagner 268-6 volt with only two prongs unlabeled. The blue wire to the turn indicator was crimped into one of the blinkers (non hot side). It looked like a factory crimp or a very good mechanic did it because my wire print shows a separate blue wire hookup on the 63, which I am assuming mine is due to the pull door handles and small nut tranny. This relay was not grounded and all worked well and still works well albeit too fast. Trying to hook up the new 12ver using all possible combination of plug in yields nothing except turning the speedo turn indicator on steady but never a blinky anywhere. All 12v conversion tech articles including the one on this homepage say to change the relay but
 don't give specifics as to what exactly needs to be hooked up and where. Any help would be greatly appreciated. BTW the emergency flashers worked as well before I pulled the turn sig relay. Can I leave this side alone as I rarely would use it but if I needed to use it, I guess it would burn up fast.???
