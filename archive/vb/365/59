Subject: Re: Steering box removal

That13mm crossbolt has been removed, and frankly was a bitch to do, lots 
of prying at the metal keeper and a lot of hot wax. The shaft barely 
touches now, not enough to bind things up.

It attaches two places correct?
1) Four bolts on the right side
2) the steering coupler

I am either missing something or the thing is rusted in place. I hot 
waxed the part that goes through the frame part  and was gonna try again 
today but I got enough ticks off last night and it rained all day. If I 
had a cutting torch I would cut the section out and bring it inside to 
play. :-)

Yes. The coupler is between the steering column and the box. Under the 
coupler is a flange that is bolted to the shaft on top of the box. There is 
a 13mm crossbolt, with a nut held on by a keeper that has to be bent back. 
Pull out that cross bolt. You may have to lift the column off the splined 
shaft. I pulled my box out a year ago.
