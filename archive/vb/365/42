Subject: Props to Ron & Bus Depot

I tried to post this to the list yesterday, but
apparently didn't go, so I'll try again...

>Ron,
Thanks for the help with the rocker panel.
Props to you and the BusDepot for going above and
beyond the call of duty to help me out!<

I know that EVERYONE has an opinion about the Bus
Depot, so it is not necessary for everyone to share it
right now ;^)  However I just want to let you know
that in the last week Ron went WAY above and beyond
the call of duty to get me a rocker panel fast without
making me go broke on shipping charges. It IS
appreciated and will be remembered next time I have
parts I need to order!


Peace, John Baker
