that' s  interesting - afaicr, all the posters i read mentioned 
slightly worse mpg;  after all, you now had TWO holes to pour gas down

Hi Craig,
As always it depends on many factors like parts chosen, driving  habits, etc..
  If one installs BIG carbs (as in much bigger venturi) they will  not meter 
the fuel properly till much higher RPMs. In the lower RPMs they will  have to 
be set and jetted to be a slobbery mess to keep the engine  running.
  Plus if one has installed bigger carbs they most likely are shooting  not 
for better MPG, but more HP and speed.  So more of a lead foot is used,  and 
MPG suffers.
  Have thought of someday trying a type 4 engine converted to upright,  and 
building intake manifolds to mount 36 HP carbs.  Since these carbs  were 
designed for 1100-1200cc sized engines, two should work on a 2000cc.   Then again 
for the time, trouble, and expense, fuel injection would  probably be a much 
better way to go in that situation.
