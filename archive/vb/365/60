Subject: Sunday symptoms search

so today I did a bit of work on the bus. Managed to find the source of
an issue I have had on it for at least several months. I thought it
might be fun to put the symptoms out there for people to guess what
was wrong.

-1600SP w/ dual solex carbs
-Drives good with normal power at road speed.
-has slight issues idling, but does pretty good.
-While doing a compression check (140psi all) notice that the 3/4 head
 does not have the same "suck" from the top of the carb the 1/2 head
 does. Seems strange. Acts like head has gone bad and not allowing good
 compression, but obviously compression check proves that incorrect.
-Carb and manifold both tight and secure on engine

any guesses?
