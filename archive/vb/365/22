Subject: Bus front clip in Maine

Hi,

I bought a split bus front clip in Maine for my cousin. I'm going to  
have to tell the seller that my cousin is a no-show and pay some  
"reparation" unless someone on the list wants to drive up to Caribou  
Maine and pick up a front bus clip - yours to keep for free. All I  
ask in return is a complimentary cup of coffee if I happen up that  
way someday.

Mail me off list if you are interested.

Conrad
