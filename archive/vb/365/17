Hi Mark,
Under the rear seat.  If one wanted to see the other side of the belt  mounts 
you would have to remove engine and fuel tank to see them.
  Check out your local wrecking yard that has any 1968-79 buses for  the 
proper mounts.  We have been cutting these and the shoulder mounts out  of these 
later buses for later cutting and welding in our earlier buses.
