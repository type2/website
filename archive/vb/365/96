Kevin,

The heat is a sign of a bad connection that literally burns up power that
would otherwise go to your head lights or whatever other electrical item is
being operated. Usually just cleaning up connections will take care of the
"hot" problem. Look carefully at the slip on terminals that should be
crimped to the end of the wires. Sometimes the crimp itself will corrode. If
it is corroded, cut it off and crimp on a new one or solder it as you
mentioned. If the contacts inside the switch are dirty, heat will also be
produces. Opening up the switch and cleaning the contacts may be an option,
if you can get the switch open.
