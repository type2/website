Subject: RE: [VB] Rear sway bar/camber compensator

Hey Paul,

Sorry no pictures yet of the IRS swaybar install.  It is really straight 
forward though.

The bar connects with "U" anchors to the torsion bar housing and than 
connects to the arms with down rods attached to the lower shock bolts.  This 
is for IRS though so with swing axle I do not know what the product would 
work like.

Good Luck,
