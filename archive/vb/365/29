Subject: Starter bushing fits loosely--a problem?

Good morning!

I am converting my '64 Std to 12V and drove the original bushing out
with a 9mm socket on an extension. It seemed to be in tightly. However
the new "6V-to-12V" bushing I got from WW just slides right in. And
out. When the engine is installed it appears that the range the bushing
can move will be limited by the case and the gear on the starter, but I
wonder if this is going to cause problems. Has anyone encountered this
before? If it will be a problem if left like this, has anyone got a
workaround or should I try another bushing from another source?

Thanks in advance for any help in this.
