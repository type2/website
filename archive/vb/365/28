Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel pump rebuild seal ?

Hey Adrian,

Use the permatex. I have a similar pump, all original exept for the 8mm head
screw. I had to tap the hole with a 10-32 thread and I used a allen head cap
screw. The permatex was the ticket for sealing. Not a drop of leakage yet.
(only a year and a half and 550 miles). It is gas proof where the RTV will
swell and soften from the fuel.

 I have 307,000 miles on that pump. I am going for 500K.

Chris
