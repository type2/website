I installed a bay flasher relay on my 59. Part # 211 953 315 C been working
fine for 6 years.

Terminal connections as follow

49: Black with white/green trace from fuse box. Thicker of the two.

49A: Black with white/green trace to TS switch. Thinner of the two.

KBL: Blue from indicator light in speedo.

31: NEW WIRE YOU WILL ADD. Make it tannish/brown and connect to a known
secure ground. The old original can picked up ground through it's case when
fastened to the mount.

Hi all. I have broke down and converted my earrrly 64 SC to 12v. All works
but my turn signals flash rapidly so I thought I should change the 6v relay.
The 12v one I have is the 3 prong with 49 49a and 31 terminals. How can I
make this 1 work or do I need another.
