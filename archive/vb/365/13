Subject: Rear seat belt mounts

Guys:

Newbie needs help.

My 66 Kombi has its original front seatbelts and points.  M-Code 425

It has a period (aftermarket) Z-bed, no middle seat. Floor is covered 
with a particleboard topped by linoleum. I have a rubber mat over that.

I cannot find the rear seatbelt attachment points. Not even in my 
Bentley Manual. I have researched online and apparently some folks have 
black plastic plugs somewhere back there. Are the mount sites, if 
present, visible from underneath the bus? What is there exact location? 
(I would love to see a photo). I really don't want to rip up the floor 
if they are not there.  I really do not want to drill a hole either, 
but I want my kids to live. Any way to find out if they are there?

  Help!

  Thanks in advance,

  Mark
