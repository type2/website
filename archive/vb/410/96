Subject: weird backfire question

i had to move the van to let a huge truck turn in my street, and had 
an odd backfire event: car wasn't firing, so i put the tranny in 
reverse and was just going to back it up using the starter; 2 or 3 
revolutions and a loud bang is followed by the motor wheezing to 
life.  reparked it, turned it off and smelled gas - it was coming 
from inside the fuelpump-to-carb hose, right at the carb inlet... a 
fair amount shot out, enough to soak the motor.  my only guess is 
that the float valve is stuck open and allowed backfire pressure to 
shoot gas past it. any other ideas?
