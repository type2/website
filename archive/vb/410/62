That explains a lot of why I've been so confused.

So switching to 12V flywheel and starter will require grinding our
bellhousing.  I saw some good suggestions on this grind out on the samba. 

I talked to my mechanic about an autostick starter-he thinks he has one at
his place, and is going to look for it.

 

You guys are great..

 

Thanks,

If I have a 200mm 6V flywheel, why would I need to grind out the bellhousing
to fit a 12V flywheel in there? Aren't they both 200mm?
 hey kevin The 200mm is the size of the clutch not the flywheel  12V is
bigger than 6 v  later  mark d
