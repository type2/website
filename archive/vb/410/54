Hi Kevin
it's easier to swap the 6v flywheel onto the 12v engine.  That way you 
don't have to change the starter and bushing (and can go 5 mph on the 
starter in 1st gear).  just keep a spare starter and the proper wrenches 
under the seat.  change out the bulbs.  look into what it would take to 
convert the heater (blower motor, fuel pump, ignition coil).   I ran a 
66 bug for many years like that.
