I am  planning on going to 12V eventually.

My existing 6V flywheel is 200mm  not 180mm. Therefore I was thinking I could
just take the 6V flywheel,  attach to the 12V motor. Install the 12V motor in
the bus and go. The 6V  flywheel should engage fine with the existing
starter(as it is 6V as well),  right?



It sounds like I will need to replace the flywheel seal,  and check the
endplay-after swapping flywheels.



Yeah I  counted the teeth of the two flywheels, and can see the difference.
But it  sounds like you are saying the 6V flywheel should attach to the
crankshaft  of the 12V engine without any machining.



It sounds like I will  also need to change my solenoid to 12V?



I wonder if I just take  the starter and solenoid from the beetle, and put
those in my bus along  with the engine.

hey kevin   just leave the starter alone and keep the 6v 200mm  flywheel with 
it. this saves you from grinding the bellhousing and changing the  bushing.   
change everything else over to 12v,  lite  bulbs(including dash bulbs) 
relays,(signal,hi low ,) use a reducer for the wiper  motor or get the armuture to 
swap it over(I think wolfsburg west has this)   .  good luck  later  mark d
