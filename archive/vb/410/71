Dave,

Any updates on the electric conversion or the IRS into the 59?

I am here and fairly new at this but enjoying the e-mails.  Have two current
 projects.  Converting a 60 van to an electric vehicle and updating a 59 van
 using busboy's IRS II kit.  Both projects should be completed by end of
 summer.  Any thoughts or suggestions are welcome.
