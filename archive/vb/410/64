Subject: They're on their way to BNNTA...

Hi everyone,

As we load up our buses with event equipment, we have heard from several who
are already on their way to the BNNTA camping event this weekend.  Some of the
members of the DBG Club departed Wisconsin this morning to cruise down the
Mississippi River towards the event.  They should be in the group campground
that I leased for the event sometime on Thursday.  A few others are also
already on the way.  We are looking forward to seeing the "ice fisherman from
Oshkosh" too.  The Corps of Engineers Park Rangers said they will open the
gate to our private event site on Thursday for the early arrivals.  They "may"
collect a normal one night campground fee, and then again, they might not?
Who knows?  We'll arrive Friday morning to officially kick off the event and
get everyone settled in as they arrive.

We are looking forward to seeing everyone very soon, and wish for you a very
fun and safe journey to Mark Twain Lake.  If you are deciding to head our way
at the last minute, go to http://www.bnnta.com for a simple event website and
a map link for driving directions.  The weather forecast is very nice for the
weekend, with temps predicted to be in the mid-80's, and nice cool nights (so
bring a sweatshirt just in case).

Have a great, long safe Labor Day holiday weekend everyone!

Bill Bowman
