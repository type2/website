Sam,

Not true as far as I know. There is no requirement that an engine have a s/n 
or a model number stamped into it. No cop has ever asked to see the engine 
number on any of my vehicles. Now the VIN, thats important.

I just installed a new Meximotor. It came with no numbers on a new 1600 DP
 Engine.
 Last night I was told that if the police stopped me I could get my 63
 singlecab impounded, and should go to the DMV and get assigned engine
 numbers.
