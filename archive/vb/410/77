Subject: engine studs

I just realized that the engine studs at the bottom of the replacement
engine are not attached to the case, but were attached to the transmission
case of the bug. These are the bottom two studs of the 4 total bolts that
hold the engine to the transmission.

I need to get some engine studs and insert them into the engine case. Where
do I find torque values for this? And I believe I should be using some
loc-tite on the stud, but I'm not sure what type.
