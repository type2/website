If this  checks out, I will install new main seal, put flywheel back on, and
put  engine in.

Thanks for all your help. I'll keep you posted as I  continue.

I'm sure to be asking about what's required to change a 6V  gas heater to
12V. I know I'll need to replace the coil on it, but not sure  what else.

hey kevin  sounds good so far. I have a crankshaft with a flywheel  attached 
to it for grinding out the bellhousings, makes it easier to turn.Do not  
forget the o ring in the flywheel and torqueing the gland nut to 265  ft-lbs.  I 
have ran these 6V gas heaters by using the resistor that comes  in late 
golfs,jettas for the fan motors, test the voltage and one of the outlets  is 6 V.   
they get the different speeds for the 12V fans by varing the  voltage.   later
