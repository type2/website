Kevin,

  Just grind out the bellhousing and use a 12v starter or auto-stick.   
Its no big deal to do so.

change out you headlights, taillights, and dash bulbs and be done with  
it.  (leave horn and wiper 6v for now)

you will be glad you switched.  you have been dealing with 6v too  
long,  6v is starting to be for 'collector' cars only
