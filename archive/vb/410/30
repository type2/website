Actually even higher if the tire is not an actual LT rated tire (which many
aren't), as its load capacity must be derated if used on a Bus. Many LT
rated tires that do have the capacity are designed for trucks and therefore
have a hard and/or loud ride. See http://busdepot.com/details/tires.jsp for
more details on choosing the right Bus tire.

We have some excellent Vredesteins that combine passenger car
handling/comfort with 1764 lb. load capacity:
