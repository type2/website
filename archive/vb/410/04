Subject: Re: was spring washer-now stretched valve stem

Hi Gary,

While I appreciate your point of view, I completely disagree.  Dual
valve springs definitely cause broken wave washers.  Single high-rev
springs (the outer spring on duals) *can* cause the same.  In those
situations solid rocker shafts are the ONLY part that should be used.
Don't trust the stock clips to hold, because they won't.  Correct me
if I'm wrong, but aren't we talking stock springs on a set of stock
heads.  If he's breaking spring washers still, there is a larger
problem that won't go away by ignoring it.

There is no difference between the damage caused by broken valves
while cruising down the hwy (-at-) 3K+ RPMs and cruising around town
shifting gears (-at-) 3K+ RPMs.  I can guarantee you the damage will be the
same when that valve snaps from being ignored.  3K RPMs = about 12.5
firings per cylinder per second.  I've seen my fair share of broken
valves and I can assure you that *IF* you could stop a motor w/in 2
seconds of a valve breaking (which is impossible, but for argument
sake), your motor is an instant door stop.  To encourage someone to
throw on a lash cap (which probably won't fit anyway due to a
mushroomed head) and replace the wave spacers w/ solids is IMHO bad
advice.

If your head rebuilder is not evenly grinding seats, valves and
trimming the valve stems so that they are even (w/in a thousandth or
so), get another rebuilder.  I've seen heads as you say with stems
that are off as much as 1/16"+.  What that translates into is un-equal
rocker geometry between valves that wears guides, valves and seats
rapidly and unevenly.  When you pay good money for heads, why accept
half-(-at-)$$ work.

I think Kevin has been given a rare 2nd and 3rd chance here which most
folks never get.  Find the cause, or expect worse next time. . .  Good
Luck!!
