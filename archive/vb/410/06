Hi Nate,
	If Kevin removes the rocker arms and the dented valve stem is  
sticking out farther than the other valves, you have made a great  
point and Kevin is lucky to still have an engine!  I can't remember  
if if Kevin checked this out?  If this is not the case I think that  
lash caps will work.  Of course you'd want to install lash caps on  
all valves to maintain valve train geometry which may well be off at  
any rate and possibly shim out the rockers.  As to the quality of  
valve jobs, I find it cheaper to buy new medium quality heads than  
getting quality valve work. Go to any part shop that sells rebuilt  
heads and put a straight edge along the tops of the valve stems and  
you will find that the valves are all at different heights.  I've had  
quality heads that have been rebuilt three times where the exhaust  
valves have plainly sunk into their seats and the intakes and exhaust  
valves are just at different heights.   These heads will still give  
maybe 15-30 K miles if assembled with care.
	I agree that solid rocker assembles are needed with stout valve  
springs.  Anything with clips will fail then.  Watch out, many of the  
solid rocker assembles for sale are junk.  Still, with stock and even  
slightly stronger valve springs the stock rocker assembles are fine  
with clips if the wavey washers are replaced with the proper  
thicknesses of flat washers.  I think that's where I got into this  
discussion.  Look at almost any 40 year old stock rockers assembly  
and the wavey washers will be worn paper thin on their high side.   
Something that every vintage bus driver should be aware of!
