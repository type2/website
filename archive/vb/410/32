Jim,

How about Bridgestone Dueler A/T's. P205-75R15's.  Load rated at 1598 pounds 
at 44 psi.
The only downside is that my spare won't quite fit all the way down into my 
spare tire well in the non-walk thru partition. These tires seem to be 
slightly taller than the michelin passenger tires I used to use.

Rides relatively smooth and quiet.
