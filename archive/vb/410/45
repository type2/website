Subject: engine swap

Well, I had a little time this weekend, and I pulled the engine in my
bus(which had the stretched valve stem or some other disorder, which I have
yet to fully diagnose, although pointed in certain areas of research by the
list).

The bus had a 1600 single port, carbed engine. It has a 200 mm 6 volt
flywheel, 6v starter and 6V gas heater, 6V small generator.

Right now I am hoping to get it going for another month or two, or until the
weather turns real bad, at which point I hope to garage it, strip it down
and do some body work on it, and some engine work, also upgrade to 12V. My
work usually slows down in the winter, so I hope to focus on my bus then.

I have a  12V bug engine, that is in good condition. I was thinking of a
short term, easy fix would be to put the bug engine into the bus. I thought
initially just swap the engines with generators attached, change flywheel
and clutch, and I'll be 12V, and running. I'll need to also change all
bulbs, and my battery. I am a little confused as to 12v vs 6v flywheel.

Basically, what will happen if I put a 6V flywheel on an engine with a 12V
generator?

Suggestions/comments appreciated.

Thanks,

-Kevin
