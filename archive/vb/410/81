Congrats on getting the bus going!

I've never replaced the emergency light flasher (the 4 connector unit). Replacing the 3 wire flasher for the turn signals always takes care of the emergency lights too. I've always just bought the generic 3 wire flasher at the FLAPS and tried the different connections until it works. I do recommend the "heavy duty" flasher if they offer one. The regular ones only last a couple of years.
