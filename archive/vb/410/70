Subject: re:engine swap update

Well I was lucky enough that my mechanic was able to find a used autostick
starter in his pile of parts. I installed that today.

I removed the 12V flywheel from the bug engine. I attached the clutch to it,
and put it on the end of the transmission shaft(I think that is what it's
called).  I got this idea from the list and the samba.

I slowly spun this in the bellhousing, thereby grinding out the bellhousing.
I would do a little, then vacuum, then do a little more, then vacuum etc. I
think I have enough ground out.but will double check by taking some
measurements. This was not at all as hard as I thought it would be. Just a
little tedious.

I then took the existing shims, and main seal off the crankshaft/engine. I
installed flywheel, and measured endplay. I came up with .035". I put the
original shims back, and get an endplay of .004". I read the specs to be
between .003 and .005 inches, so I think I am good for endplay.

I will now double check that I have enough of the bellhousing ground out.

If this checks out, I will install new main seal, put flywheel back on, and
put engine in.

Thanks for all your help. I'll keep you posted as I continue.

I'm sure to be asking about what's required to change a 6V gas heater to
12V. I know I'll need to replace the coil on it, but not sure what else.
