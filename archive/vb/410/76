I  torqued the gland nut to 250 ft lbs. I have seen values from 215 to  250,
this is the first time I saw 265 ft lbs. There is not o-ring in this  set up.
I'm not sure why, but I have never seen this o-ring in any engine  work I
 
hey kevin  whoops  should be about 220ft lbs  , 250 is for  the porsche 
356/912 gland nut which I use a lot on performance motors.   There aren't too many 
of the 200mm 12 V flywheels that didn't have the o ring .  even fewer of the 
6V flywheels had them. You do know where it is located right?  On the back side 
where the crank and flywheel meet.   Hope it all  works out for you  later  
mark d


have  done.
