Kevin,

If you happen to still have the battery hold down strap and clip, you might 
want to find a battery that fits under the strap and of course in the 
battery tray. I have an Interstate Battery Type MT-42. 12V, 400 CCA, 500CA. 
Works fine for me down here in So. Cal. Here is a link for INterstate.
