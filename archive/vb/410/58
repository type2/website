Hi John,

I don't understand one thing, actually there is a lot I don't understand,
but I'll start with one question at a time. 

If I have a 200mm 6V flywheel, why would I need to grind out the bellhousing
to fit a 12V flywheel in there? Aren't they both 200mm?
	
My long-term plan is to go 12V. I now need a new starter, so I figure
instead of getting another 6V, I could just get a 12V with a bushing
adaptor. Although I do like the idea of a 6V starter on a 12V engine-I have
heard you get great powerful starts, even when it's really cold out.

Kevin,

You still need to remove the flywheel from the 12V engine even if you 
decide to use it. It's not very likely that the seal behind it is good, 
so you need to remove the flywheel to replace it.

You aren't getting out of any work by using the 12V flywheel. Not only 
do you have to pull the flywheel to replace the seal whichever way you 
go, you will add the job (not a small job) of grinding out your 
bellhousing to allow the 12V flywheel to fit if you decide to go all 
12V. You will also have to find a 6V Outside diameter X 12V Inside 
diameter bushing for your starter. It's a lot easier to use the bushing 
that will probably come in the box with the new starter if you stay with 
6V. If you do decide to go all 12V, be sure to remove your throwout 
bearing before you do the grinding. If you get chips in it you will ruin 
it. I ground out a bellhousing about 20 years ago and that was enough 
for me for a lifetime. I thought I was going to have to grind for a 
month to get it done. I finished the job by starting the engine and 
pulling it up to the transmission with the mounting nuts. The flywheel 
teeth did the final bit of work as I tightened the nuts. It was not fun.

Save yourself a lot of trouble. Use the 6V 200mm clutch flywheel that 
you already have and just replace your 6V starter and bushing. It's a 
lot easier and you'll have a starter that will crank like crazy even in 
the dead of winter.
