On the carb do the usual things. Disassemble and soak in carb dip.
Blow out all passages with compressed air. Install rebuild kit. Also
beware that you are not running a PIC 34 carb. If so, replace it with
a PIC 28 ,30 ,31 or 32. The idling problem is typical of PIC 34 and VW
issued a lot of tech bulletins about new drillings, etc, so it is not
worth saving if you have one.

Also save yourself some headache next time and use a Dremel or similar
rotary tool to clearance the bellhousing. Took me just a few minutes
to do mine.

The last bit of bellhousing needed to be clearance more, which took a
bit more effort that I thought. A couple in and out with the motor.

It now runs, but will not idle. I think the carb is probably gunked
up, as it is from the bug, which was not run too often. This not
idling problem existed in the bug when the engine was in it. Any tips
on clearing the gunk, or identifying the location of the idle problem
would be appreciated.
