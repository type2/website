Hi Jeremiah,

Yep! It's a slower route but it does have some nice twists and turns, some 
great views as it hugs the hills and bluffs near the Mississippi River.  Hwy 
79 passes through some neat old river towns as you head north towards 
Hannibal.  There you head straight west on Hwy 36/24 towards Monroe City, 
and then southwest on Hwy 24 to the Indian Creek Recreation Area and then on 
to the group campground.  Watch for small "VW Campout" signs for the last 
five miles or so.

I leased the entire campground for the event and there are already early 
birds in the campground.  We're heading up to set up camp on Friday morning 
Hope to see you all there in just hours for the long holiday weekend.  Great 
weather forecast too.  Go to http://www.bnnta.com for more info and a map 
link to this long-running VW camping event.  Drive safely!

Bill & Kathryn Bowman
