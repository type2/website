Subject: Re: [VB] engine swap

If you swap flywheels you do need to check the endplay and re-set if neccessary.
New flywheel seal and O-ring is a good idea, if they are not new(need to change teh main seal if you swap shims around anyway).
Might as well replace the oil cooler seals while the engine is out.

Or, yes, ?you can take the 12V starter from the bug and install it in the bus.? If you do that you shoudl use a new starter bushing which may be 6V case to 12V starter.
Clearancing the tranny may also be needed to run the 12V FW
