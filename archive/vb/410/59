Is this a real thing? 

 

Ok, yeah, I just did a quick online search for this, sounds like a great
idea. Any reason not to go this route? I saw one at jb*ugs.com. I have never
heard of this before.but if you don't need a bushing, and it works good.

If you're going to get a new starter, get the autostick version - no more
bushings!
