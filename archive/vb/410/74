Hi Mark,

 

I torqued the gland nut to 250 ft lbs. I have seen values from 215 to 250,
this is the first time I saw 265 ft lbs. There is not o-ring in this set up.
I'm not sure why, but I have never seen this o-ring in any engine work I
have done.

 

The gas heater is not a priority, as it is still warm here, I plan on
running the bus for another month or two, then bringing it into the garage
for a big overhaul/cleanup etc. I'll address the gas heater at that point.
Thanks for the starting info.

 

Thanks again to all who have helped me in this swap. I am now thinking about
the battery. I plan on picking one up today. Are the optima ones worth it?
Any ideas on what I should be looking for? I'm thinking to just ask for
whatever battery is designed for a '67 12V bus.

If this checks out, I will install new main seal, put flywheel back on, and
put engine in.

Thanks for all your help. I'll keep you posted as I continue.

I'm sure to be asking about what's required to change a 6V gas heater to
12V. I know I'll need to replace the coil on it, but not sure what else.

hey kevin  sounds good so far. I have a crankshaft with a flywheel attached
to it for grinding out the bellhousings, makes it easier to turn.Do not
forget the o ring in the flywheel and torqueing the gland nut to 265 ft-lbs.
I have ran these 6V gas heaters by using the resistor that comes in late
golfs,jettas for the fan motors, test the voltage and one of the outlets is
6 V.   they get the different speeds for the 12V fans by varing the voltage.
