Subject: Re: [VB] Wow, I'm on vintagebus (need help with '58)

Sounds like a standard microbus... those came with two tone paint and two tone interior.? In between a deluxe (extra windows) but cost more than a kombi (much more spartan).

Fairly solid with both pressed bumpers??? Yes it's worth $2k.
Brakes and a battery aren't too big a deal.
But it does take a bunch of work to get a bus that's been sitting for 20 years back on the road.? IMO, it's worth it.?? 

This is the interior colors used for 55-58 standard microbuses:

does it have the trim panel under the rear seat with the swirly patternin the metal??? that is highly sought after.? (really)

If you decide to not go for it. odds are that someone would be very happy to save the bus and get it back on the road.

So the question, is it worth $2000 (the asking) and what kind of money will I
burn through going through the brakes (with hard and soft lines and cylinders)
shocks, etc to get it runnable (I have a 1600 SP to toss in and actually some
parts for a core '59 36hp I had been collecting for a vert I briefly had.)
 
This is an exceptionally solid (but dinged up in locations) bus, but I'm
really not a split guy.? It is just so darn old though, and I like its karma 
Thanks
John
