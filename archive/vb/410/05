Decided to chime in on this one.?

My Dad was taking the family camping in our 64 DD camper bus around that time. In the fall he would take my brother and I up into the Sierras or the coast range for deer hunting too. Had some good times in that bus. I later took my family camping in that same old bus. Its lookin pretty good these days since the restoration.?
