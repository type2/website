Subject: re:engine swap

Well, I thought I was making decent progress.I had both engines out. I had
one flywheel removed, and was waiting for a friend to help me move the other
engine so I could pull that flywheel. I had all the

 

As recommended by the list, I decided to swap the starter bushing. At the
same time I was going to disconnect the 'hot start relay' as I had been
having odd starting problems for a while, which I think are related to the
starter relay. Plus since I was going to 12V, I thought I wouldn't need the
relay anymore.

 

So I removed the starter, then put a wrench on the 13mm nut that holds the
wire from the battery to the solenoid. I twisted, without much force, and
the whole end of the solenoid came apart in my hands. It basically
shattered. I guess the plastic end was too old, and had dried up. I don't
really get it, but it happened to me. I'd taken that apart before without
any problems.

 

Then I was thinking, why don't I just take the starter out of the beetle.
This time, I started by removing the nut from the solenoid while the
solenoid was still attached to the transmission. Now I can see that the stud
is spinning with the nut. The underside of this bug is so rusted in parts,
that any work on it requires safety goggles.

 

Time for a break.

 

So if I need a new starter-should I just get a 12V starter now that I'm
going to 12V? That way I don't need to remove the flywheel from the
replacement engine.
