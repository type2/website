Subject: GAS TANK

I have a 61 single cab that has been sitting for several (15+) years.  I
gave it a full tune up. Put some fresh gas and tried starting it.
It started when I poured a small amount of gas in the carb.  It looks like
fuel is not coming from my gas tank (have fuel filter on the fuel line
coming from the gas tank). It is my mechanical fuel pump not working? How
would I know if it/isn't?  Is it my gas tank? Do I have really have to pull
my tank?  If so..how do you do that?  Thanks Mike
