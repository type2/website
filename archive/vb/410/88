I know it's a month out... but I need to plan my time off....I am planning
on going to this year's Busses & Ballons, looking to put together a
caravan.  I'm not sure if there is one that leaves from Phoenix and the ABC
crew.  I'm in Tucson.  Anyone know anything.. or p-mail me and we can
organize something.

 Back
again for our 12th year, the Albuquerque Air Alliance and NMBC present
Busses & Balloons 2008!

Come camp with us and help raise money and awareness for the Roadrunner Food
Bank and the Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central New Mexico. The event
coincides with the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, the largest
gathering of Hot-Air balloons in North America. All three days balloons of
all shapes, sizes and colors will be taking to the sky. Thousands of
balloons can be seen without ever leaving camp!

This years event will contain a show and shine with "fun awards" as well as
a raffle, a live band, and kids activities. Tune down those engines for some
slow drag competition (with prizes for the top three competitors)

Come see friends new and old and have a good time for a good cause.


NEW THIS YEAR:

We will be offering FREE shuttle rides to the Balloon Launch Field on
Saturday Morning, as well as a caravan down to the field for the Balloon
Glow at dusk.

Tricycle races: If it's human powered and three wheeled, you're in. Prizes
for the top 3 competitors.
