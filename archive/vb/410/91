Last update I think..

Thanks to all for your help.
1. I got the bus running again. 
2. I installed a new flasher relay, works fine, actually seems better than
before. It required a new ground wire, and I don't see a way to secure it,
but I don't think I need to. I think it can just float in the space behind
the kick panel.
3. I put a ground wire on the gas gauge-as that would 'pin' to Full whenever
I turned on the headlights. That solved that problem.
4. Everything seems to work fine now. I have driven a bit around town. 
5. This weekend I hope to clean up the bus, and get my tools-which are in a
bit of disarray back together.
6. Again, thanks for all your help.

Fall project-make garage weather tight for winter, so I can play with the
bus all winter! I've been dying to attack some of the rust on this thing,
hopefully I will get a chance this winter.
