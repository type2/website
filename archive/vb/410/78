Subject: re:engine swap update

Well, I got new studs into the case. I got the engine in, wrestled with the
exhaust for a while. I got everything hooked up, realized I needed a voltage
regulator-luckily I had an extra on lying around.

I think I have all the wiring figured out-I got rid of the hot-start relay.
I do not have new relays, I realize I need a new flasher relay and emergency
light relay. Maybe I can find these at my FLAPS. I did replace all the
bulbs.

I tried to turn the engine over-and I get a good strong click.but that is
it. I think I need to grind the bell housing out more. So I'll drop the
engine again, and try to figure out where it's rubbing, and hope I don't
need to grind out too much.

Hopefully I'll get it going by the end of the day Monday.

Thanks for your help so far..
