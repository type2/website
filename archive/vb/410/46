Basically, what will happen if I put a 6V flywheel on an engine with a  12V
generator?


hey kevin    Are you planning on changing it to 12 volt and  leaving it that 
way. That would be my choice. You can leave the starter 6 v or  some change 
the solenoid to 12v ,  then you can mount the 6 v flywheel to  the other engine. 
You really should reset the end play at that point and replace  the flywheel 
seal. The differences are that the 6 v is 180mm clutch set up and  has 
different number of teeth , the 12 v flywheeel will not work with the 6 v  starter 
and vice -verus. The 12 v flywheel wont go on the 6v cranfshaft without  machine 
work.but the 6v will match up to a 12v crankshaft.     hope that helps  later

Suggestions/comments  appreciated.

Thanks,
