Subject: Re: was spring washer-now stretched valve stem

Kevin,

You've had 3(?) springs break now and found one hammered valve on the
same rocker. . .  It's time to pull the head before the valve breaks
and junks the entire motor.  Those springs breaking are a warning to
you. . . A very mild warning at that ;-)

I would recommend removing the rocker assembly and putting a
straight-edge across the valves and see if the mushroomed valve is
sticking out further than the others.  If it is, you have a pounded
seat and you're risking a broken valve.  Even if stem is just
stretching, that is just as terminal and devastating when it breaks.
Once a valve stem looses it's heat treatment from running hot they
just break in a matter of time and take the rest of the motor right
along with it.  It's time to FIX this for real.  Good Luck!!
