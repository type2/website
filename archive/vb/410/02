Hi Nate,
	I agree that Kevin's cylinder heads are most likely in need of  
attention.  If this engine is only used to put put a bus around town,  
I would still recommend putting a lash cap on the dented valve stem  
and replace all of the wavey washers with flat washers on the rocker  
assembly and just drive.  When the wavey washers break the clips that  
hold the rockers together will go and then you have a real mess.   
Also, when was the last time you saw a rebuilt vw cylinder head where  
all of the valves stems were at the same height?!
	Gene Berg used to say "been clipped recently?"  He showed me years  
ago how stronger than stock valve springs along with other issues  
will cause the wavey washers in the rocker assembles to fail and  
break the clips.  The wavey washers need to go on Kevin's engine.
