Hi Mark,

 

Thanks so far.

This is the plan then-

1.       Take bug motor, switch flywheel for 6V 200mm flywheel. 

2.       Leave starter. 

3.       When switching flywheel, change flywheel gasket. And check endplay.
I still need to figure out what check endplay means.

4.       Change coil

5.       Change all bulbs

6.       Change wiper armature.

7.       Change relays to 12V? I'll have to find these relays, not sure
where they are, but I'm thinking I should be able to find them in the wiring
diagram, right?

8.       I'm going to get rid of my hot-start relay, which I think has gone
bad, as I've had really weird starting problems lately.

 

Thanks so much..

 

-Kevin

I am planning on going to 12V eventually.

My existing 6V flywheel is 200mm not 180mm. Therefore I was thinking I could
just take the 6V flywheel, attach to the 12V motor. Install the 12V motor in
the bus and go. The 6V flywheel should engage fine with the existing
starter(as it is 6V as well), right?



It sounds like I will need to replace the flywheel seal, and check the
endplay-after swapping flywheels.



Yeah I counted the teeth of the two flywheels, and can see the difference.
But it sounds like you are saying the 6V flywheel should attach to the
crankshaft of the 12V engine without any machining.



It sounds like I will also need to change my solenoid to 12V?



I wonder if I just take the starter and solenoid from the beetle, and put
those in my bus along with the engine.

hey kevin   just leave the starter alone and keep the 6v 200mm flywheel with
it. this saves you from grinding the bellhousing and changing the bushing.
change everything else over to 12v,  lite bulbs(including dash bulbs)
relays,(signal,hi low ,) use a reducer for the wiper motor or get the
armuture to swap it over(I think wolfsburg west has this)  .  good luck
later  mark d
