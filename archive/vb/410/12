Subject: re:was spring washer-now stretched valve stem

Wow.thanks for all the discussion on this. I am slammed at work right now.
I've asked my mechanic to start looking for a single port head-for
replacement.

I will look at the set up more closely this weekend, and hopefully determine
a bit more of what is going on. I'll use your suggestions to check where the
valve stem is.

 

Thanks, and I will keep you updated.

 

As for working on my bus, I enjoy it. But I think I enjoy it on my own time,
not my buses. I was hoping two things-that I could make it to the winter,
and that I could winterize my garage before winter hits. Then I was going to
take a lot of my bus apart for body work.but I guess I've got to get some
work done now, to last the summer.
