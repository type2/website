Ron,

I read your web page with great interest. What tires do you recommend for an 
early 64 delivery bus with stock 15" rims? I didn't see a specific 
recomendation on your web page.

BTW, I looked at the Bridgestone tire page and could no longer find the 
Dueler A/T's  I have. And I suspect that they are a little light for bus use 
anyway after reading the web page.

Thanks,
Chris
