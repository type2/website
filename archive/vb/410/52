Been running a 6V starter and solenoid for about 30 years now. Don't bother 
changing the starter or the solenoid. Just swap over everything else to the 
12V system.  One word of caution: Make sure the shaft on the starter that 
engages with the starter bushing is in good condition and install a new 
starter bushing. Then install a new starter bushing about every 20-30K 
miles. Use some quality lube in the bushing.

Running 12V on a 6V starter doubles the torque and consequently the load on 
the starter bushing. This accelerates the wear.
