Subject: Announcement: Buses By The Depot (and Bus Depot Open House),

Buses By The Depot will be Saturday October 4 this year, at Green Lane Park
in Pennsylvania (just down the road from the Bus Depot).  As in previous
years, there will be a caravan to the Bus Depot (where we'll have an open
house / garage sale), followed by potluck dinner back at the campground.
You can spend the day for free, or stay overnight for just $10. 

We had a nice turnout last year - hoping to see you all again, and many new
faces!   Please RSVP.  See the details at:  http://busdepot.com/BBD2008.htm
