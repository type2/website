Subject: no engine numbers

I just installed a new Meximotor. It came with no numbers on a new 1600 DP
Engine.



Last night I was told that if the police stopped me I could get my 63
singlecab impounded, and should go to the DMV and get assigned engine
numbers.




I could of course stamp in the original numbers that were on the 1200 40 HP
engine, that are on my birth certificate.




Is this correct?B 




BTW I live in California.
