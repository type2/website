Most of the cases I've seen w/o serial numbers were the universals that came
from Brazil.  They all had the type III oil filler hole and the mounts for
the rear hanger for IRS buses.  They were fair quality.

The German ones were supposed to be the good ones.  I remember hearing a
rumor that the molds were wearing out and that was the reason for the
flashing all over.

If it has 8mm head studs, then you got a goodie!
