Subject: Re: [VB] GAS TANK

I had a similar type of problem on my '67 doublecab that had sat for around 18 years.  The problem turned out to be a severely varnished up fuel tank, along with the sock filter inside of it.  The previous owner had not thought to drain the tank when he put the vehicle up in storage.  I got my first clue when I pulled the rubber gas line from the bottom of the tank and got a slow drip...drip...drip.

If you get the same slow drip when you remove that line, I would start fixing there.  For a vehicle that has sat for so long, you should also plan to remove the fuel tank and rehab it.  It is an easy job to remove the tank on the pickups; you don't have to remove the engine since the tank comes out through the treasure chest.  Just remember to first soak the rusty nuts on the tank hold-down straps with Kroil or PB Blaster.  Otherwise the bolts can snap right off when you try to loosen them and you'll have to make up replacement studs.  Ask me how I know.  Cleaning the tank involves pouring out the old gas, drying out the tank, flaking off or dissolving the old varnish through various means, then coating the insides with a sealer/protectant.  Voila!  Peace of mind on those long trips, and no more gunked-up fuel filters.
