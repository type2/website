Hi Gary,

It's pretty evident by your responses and reasoning that you like to
tinker with your bus on a regular basis.  Nothing wrong with that; I
like tinkering too.  Using heads with sunken valve seats (read that:
LOOSE) and using lash caps to mask another problem are your right as
an American.  Go for it Brother!!

The problem I have is that you encourage others to engage in this same
very, risky behavior with THEIR motors and think it's no big deal.  I
can say with full confidence that 99.99% of folks don't like to work
on their bus regularly OUT OF NECESSITY.  Working on your bus for fun
is one thing; it can be therapeutic if not spiritual for some.  But
fixing things because you took a short-cut, followed bad advice and
just ignored the obvious really takes the FUN out of it for most
folks!!  It can also cost a heck of a lot more in the end than just
doing the job right the first time.  This is especially true if it
happens away from home and you're stranded.  The AIRS list is a great
resource, but I prefer to use it to meet folks for fun, not because
I'm stranded. :-)
