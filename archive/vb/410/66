I'd jump on it. Splits are getting harder to find and more expensive.
You might bargain it down a little if you can. Money you will put into
it will depend on whether you are going to pay for work or do it
yourself. Freshening up the brakes won't cost much to get it road
worthy. Check some of the online catalogs, bus boys, wolfsburg west,
etc for an idea of what rubber, etc will cost you.

Good luck.
