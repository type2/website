thanks rennie. that's what i was beginning to suspect... i knew the 
mexican cases sometimes still said germany, but they were a better 
quality.

i told the guy that story when i was looking at it - he said he'd 
never heard that.

i paid a premium price for the case based on it being german; the guy 
wasn't trying to trick me, he just saw the word 'germany' and made a 
reasonable assumption.  i'll see if he is willing to kick back money 
to put it more in line price wise with a new brazil case...  i KNOW i 
don't really want a current brazil case, as the ones i looked at last 
week looked like sick frogs.......

i'm tempted to rebuild my trusty ol' german case, 40 over bores and all!  LOL!
