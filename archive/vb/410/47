Hi Mark,

 

I am planning on going to 12V eventually.

My existing 6V flywheel is 200mm not 180mm. Therefore I was thinking I could
just take the 6V flywheel, attach to the 12V motor. Install the 12V motor in
the bus and go. The 6V flywheel should engage fine with the existing
starter(as it is 6V as well), right?

 

It sounds like I will need to replace the flywheel seal, and check the
endplay-after swapping flywheels.

 

Yeah I counted the teeth of the two flywheels, and can see the difference.
But it sounds like you are saying the 6V flywheel should attach to the
crankshaft of the 12V engine without any machining.

 

It sounds like I will also need to change my solenoid to 12V?

 

I wonder if I just take the starter and solenoid from the beetle, and put
those in my bus along with the engine.

Basically, what will happen if I put a 6V flywheel on an engine with a 12V

hey kevin    Are you planning on changing it to 12 volt and leaving it that
way. That would be my choice. You can leave the starter 6 v or some change
the solenoid to 12v ,  then you can mount the 6 v flywheel to the other
engine. You really should reset the end play at that point and replace the
flywheel seal. The differences are that the 6 v is 180mm clutch set up and
has different number of teeth , the 12 v flywheeel will not work with the 6
v starter and vice -verus. The 12 v flywheel wont go on the 6v cranfshaft
without machine work.but the 6v will match up to a 12v crankshaft.    hope
that helps  later  mark d


Suggestions/comments appreciated.

Thanks,

-Kevin
