Subject: Re: [VB] GAS TANK

First disconnect the battery ground cable, this is too close to the fuel  
outlet.  Then remove the fuel line off the outlet of the tank to see if  fuel 
flows out.  Beware of causing any sparks while doing this!!!!  No  fuel coming 
out most likely means the old fuel turned into thick jelly kind of  stuff.  That 
will require removal of the reserve switch, and sticking a  screwdriver up 
into tank to break up the jellied fuel. 
  Also a must to clean and rebuild:
1. Reserve switch.  Really nice to have working when you need to  remove 
engine or replace fuel lines and can shut off fuel flow!
2. Fuel pump.  If not rebuildable, get one that is and rebuild  kits.
3. Carb.
 
You might need to clean out both hard fuel lines.
 DO REPLACE ALL FLEX FUEL LINES!!
