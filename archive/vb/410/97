Subject: Re: [VB] weird backfire question

Craig.. the hose that goes from the fuel pump to the carb should have gas
under pressure .. about 5psi.. and should be sealed... so if it smells like
gas.. it should.. if it is leaking gas.. it shouldn't ... leaking gas from
there has nothing to do with a backfire in the manifold system...

my guess, ,the back fire is coincidental with a line leaking..  then again..
I might not understand what your saying.. :-)
