John A.,

I agree with John K. buy it if you can and have the interest. Brakes 
shouldn't be too expensive to bring back to life. The rest of the stuff will 
cost a bit if you want a nice restoration. Keep that 36hp and give it a make 
over, especially if it is complete.

Good to hear from you again.

Hey, the list is pretty quiet recently. Post to the List!

Good luck,
Chris
