First off: Thanks to all on the list.

 

I got the bus running late this afternoon. The last bit of bellhousing
needed to be clearance more, which took a bit more effort that I thought. A
couple in and out with the motor.

 

It now runs, but will not idle. I think the carb is probably gunked up, as
it is from the bug, which was not run too often. This not idling problem
existed in the bug when the engine was in it. Any tips on clearing the gunk,
or identifying the location of the idle problem would be appreciated.

 

I also need to replace the emergency relay and the flasher relay. One is a
3-wire and one is a 4-wire. Is this something I can get a my FLAPS? And if
so how do I know which one to get.

 

Thanks again, I can't wait to actually drive my bus again. I was hoping to
get at least one camping trip in it this summer.
