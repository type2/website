Sounds like bad grounding through the deck lid hinge. I'd run an additional
ground wire into the engine compartment.

I have replaced my license plate light 3 times now and it lasts a matter
of minutes each time. When I go to check it, the glass housing has a
very thin chrome-esque finish to it. The wiring harness is new and the
ground wire appears to be firmly attached to the decklid.

Any suggestions??
