Hi Paul,
More of a square stack like you were building a log cabin

Actually we run the last top 4"x4"s perpendicular to the frame running 
lengthwise and rest these on the stack.  Since the bus is going to be 
unloaded of most cargo these frame members do not get bent up.

Not badly, just a small gash and bruising.  His helper was franticly trying 
to get to jack up the bus to get him out from underneath.  This is a big 
reason why we always close the valve on the hydralic jack right after we 
lower it.  There may come a time when the jack is needed NOW and even taking 
a couple of seconds to close off the valve then is taking toooo friiiicking 
loooooong.
