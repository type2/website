I owned for a short time,  a 1966 Westfalia Dormobile Wrke # 5000, that had
the long rectangular shaped light lense which slipped over a metal bracket
of equal length that contained the bulb and switch. This was a European
Delivery model as well. Is this what you are describing?

My '67 Westy has the same lense, but mounted via the s-shaped curtain rod
bracket as described in an earlier post.

By the way, I sold the Dormobile to another bus enthusiast and it ended up
in Cincinnati in the early 90s'........ In your neck of the woods??
