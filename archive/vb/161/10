Probably!  I have only greased the front end - nothing else so haven't had
to read the manual properly.

I am not sure what you mean by Lincoln log kind of stack - is it like
triangle stack when viewing from the side?
Do I place it on the part of the frame running from side to side - where the
rails that run the length of the bus connect?

Ouch - I certainly don't want that happening - was he hurt badly?  That
sounds much more stable especially as it will be in the air for a while I
would imagine!

Thanks a lot for your help
