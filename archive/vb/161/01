I don't think he did - one of the king pins had to be adjusted for its
yearly test however since I have owned it I have greased it twice - when I
got it and then after 1250 miles.

I think there is still some nasty stuff there so I will have to do that.

My bus is a 66 and I have the Bentley manual - does this have details on
whats involved (haven't got it with me).
Powdercoating is as easy for me to get done as painting so I will go that
route - I expect the complete dissassembly and degreasing won't be that easy
though.

How do I ensure that the beam is straight - is this a procedure in Bentley
(I know I should of looked before I asked).
Another point is how do I keep the bus in the air to remove the beam.  My
bus seems pretty solid - but I wouldn't want to use the jacking points as
they are definately replacements.  To raise the front I normally use the
beam so I am going to have to find something else - could I use the chassis
rails along with wood to spread the load and axle stands?

Thanks for your help
Paul
