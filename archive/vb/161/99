Subject: My first (-at-)Bay rip off! :-)

Hi,

After a year-and-a-half I am reporting my first <real> (-at-)Bay rip off!

Don't trust the "new" and "NOS" descriptions of a seller (classicline) 
who is selling chrome VW emblems. The emblems are not even close. Mine 
was bent, dented and scratched - maybe never mounted on a bus - but 
probably someone else's return (saw one comment about the vendor making 
good). Anyways, definately not new and definately not NOS. Not even 
Brazilian quality.

Don't fall for it...

Oh well, the lure of chrome is what got me trouble in the first place... 
It's like crack.

Time to bond with the powdercoating scene. (pun intended)

Conrad
