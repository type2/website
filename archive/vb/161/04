Hi Paul,
Sounds like you are talking about the link pins!  King pins are not 
adjustable.

Yes, it does!

Powdercoating is better, just make sure to have the parts zinc primered 
before being coated with the color coat.  Semigloss 80% gloss black is 
exactly the color used on suspension and engine tin.

You can catch most bends by looking down the length of the beam tubes and 
again at about 90 degrees of the diameter.  Best though to buy a yard or 
meter long straight edge, cut the straight edge down to about 2' 5" and again 
check the straightness at two points 90 degrees apart on the diameter.

Use a hydralic jack and axle stands under the front beam to get it up off the 
front wheels.  Then build a Lincoln log kind of stack of 30" long 4"x4"s 
under the frame of the bus just behind of the front beam.  Remove the wheels, 
the front link shift rod (probably the hardest part of the job), take aprt 
the link pins to allow removal of the spindles and brakes to lighten the next 
step, and drop out the front beam.
  We use the same stack of wood to remove the tranny.  It is far more stable 
than even jack stands.  There was someone on this list a while ago that 
shoved his tranny in place and knocked his bus off the jack stands, pinning 
him to the floor under the bus!!!
