Check the bulb first - make sure the base is not all corroded - but it
sounds like you have a bad ground at the right tail light.  Probably
the simplest way to fix it is to take out the right tail light and sand
a shiny spot on the outside of the little tube the bulb base goes into.
Strip about half an inch of the end of a piece of 14 or 16 gauge wire,
preferably brown, and lay it on the shiny spot.  Put a pipe clamp around
the tube and tighten it to hold the wire to the tube.  Run the other
end of the wire to a good ground - under the bolt where the battery
negative strap bolts to the chassis is the best but something like a
tin screw will also work.  Do this to your left tail-light too for
better brightness.  I added a ground wire to my license plate light too,
for complete thoroughness.
