Subject: rust on windshield frame

Hi all,

We had our first big rain storm since I bought my bus
a couple of days ago and lo and behold... the
windshield leaks.  It was pretty bad so I went down to
my local store and picked up some new rubber, pulled
out the window, wire brushed down through the rust and
ended up with a couple of holes that go right down
into the inside of the double walled section at the
front of the bus.  I need some advice on how to fix
the holes with my limited knowledge, I don't weld.  I
had heard about some POR15 patch that I guess is for
this problem, has anyone used this and what can I
expect?  Thanks for your help.  

If this is something that absolutely needs to be fixed
by a body shop, (cut out and new section put in) how
much should I expect to pay for such a service?

There are two holes, one is no bigger than a pecil
lead and the secon one is about 1/8 of an inch at the
widest point.  

Gene,

67 Deluxe
