Subject: Westfalia Interior 66 year model.

I'm about to reinstall the Westy interior in my 66 van but I'm wondering
about a few things.
#1) Is there a plywood floor in the dining area between the rear seat and
front seats. If so how thick was it?
#2) Interior lights. I've got two interior light fixtures that came with
the Westy. 
These lights are about 6" long and hold two tube type bulbs but have no
covers. Are they worth reinstalling or should I find alternate lights?
Guess the real question is; where do I get the covers & how much?
#3) The interior parts were just floating loose, stacked in the van when
I got it.
There was no sink (I can live with that).
There was no Ice Box or water tank. (I can live with that too).
There was no Stove (I don't like that).
What could I expect to see in a 66 Westy with walk through seats?
Need pics if you can send or direct me to decent interior shots.
Possibly this vehicle may been a Weekender or some thing else but still
carried the Westfalia placard.
