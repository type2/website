Subject: Grounding Tail Light Bucket - Not Metal?

Help! I'm trying to ground my rear tail lights on my 60 Single Cab as you 
suggested. Trouble is, the bulb holder doesn't seem to be metal--or at least 
not the kind that a magnet will stick to! Is it potmetal? It is the early 
round style light.

Where and how do I attach a ground to the bucket? Do I solder? Rivet? Bolt? 
How will it ground if it isn't metal to begin with? I'm planning on running 
thr ground wire to the ground for the neg. battery terminal. Any advice 
greatly appreciated.

Sue
