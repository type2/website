You could conceivably call the stock splitty dome light bulbs "tube
type" bulbs - they are filament bulbs, but in a glass tube with a
pointy metal cap on each end, sort of like a fuse.  I think these are
called "festoon" bulbs in the UK.  Fluorescent bulbs typically have
pins on the ends for the contacts, instead of the metal end caps.
