The local electronics distributor has Alpha brand non-shrink PVC tubing
in clear, black, and white.  They have it in 24 gauge all the way up to
2.5 inches.  The 24 gauge is $3/100 ft and 0.625" is $33/100 ft.  The
bigger sizes are on 50 ft rolls: .75" $30/50 ft to 2.5" $193/50 ft.
The biggest size on a Bus is probably the bundle right below the fuse
box which is about 1" or so, which is $45/50 ft.  Your local distributor
should have similar stuff.
