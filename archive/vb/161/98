Hi everyone,
Has anyone ever seen a steering box suddenly dump oil.
I came home after work today and found a puddle of oil under my steering =
box and it leaking from the bottom cover plate.
It's never leaked before and it seems to be a spontaneous thing.

Ideas would be great on what to do.

Thanks,
Dave Barnes
