Subject: cargo door woes on 65' bus

Surely there has to be an easier way.... I am trying to reinstall the
vertical metal bars on the cargo doors of my 65 bus (don't bother asking why
tey were taken out in the firstplace) They are a total PITA to try and
reinstall. They slide up or down into the runners about 94% o the way and
then get jammed for the last 6%. I have tried various means to try and coax
them the last 6% without successI am sure that someone has experienced this
before- any suggestions??
