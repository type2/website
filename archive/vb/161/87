Ah, OK.  I agree with you there.  I've had the same experience.  I have
often found that putting the wiring back close to stock was usually the
best plan.

That's what I ran.  I did use a black wire for one ground wire I added but
when I get another spool of brown it will change.  I like to run the
added grounds back to where the negative strap bolts to the body, just
because it's easier to get to and because the wires are not then subject
to the acid and hydrogen that likes to hang out near the top of the
battery.

I'm right there with you on this one.

Yours is old enough to have that woven cloth sheathing instead of the
plastic stuff, right?  Maybe you should roll your own.  :) 
http://store.yahoo.com/delcity/wovcotfabloo.html may not be exactly right
but is similar to what I've seen for engine harnesses on older American
cars.  Del City also has nifty wire; standard PVC 165 F / 105 C stuff,
plus nice 305 F/175 C stuff.  They'll also stripe it for you for an
additional fee.  I don't work for them but I have ordered from them
before and gotten good service.
