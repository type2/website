True.  The hottest soldering iron I have is 140 W so I don't have much
luck soldering big pieces of metal.  If you have a big iron, I agree
that soldering would work well.

This one runs back to the battery negative.  The little metal terminal
I was using at the battery negative cable had three push-on adapters so
I figured it was meant to be - two tail lights and the license light.
There is a harness clip near the center top of the engine compartment
opening - I ran the ground wire through that, left a little slack, and
plugged it onto the lamp socket.

The second bulb would not be optimally positioned in the reflector, but
it should give you a little more light.  As far as failure, I figure
that's why there are two tail lights.  I guess you could snag some of
the current relays out of fancy cars or certain turn signal flashers
and plumb them into the tail light wiring up front, so that if the
current draw of the lights is too low, an indicator light comes on.

The trouble with those is that the reflectors aren't really designed
for them.  Look at the back of late-model U-Haul trailers and FedEx
trucks; their LED tail lights consist of several LEDs mounted very
close to the "lens".  oAnother problem is that LEDs emit a very narrow
range of wavelengths of light.  If the red tail-light lens doesn't pass
the wavelengths that the light is throwing out, you can easily end up
with _less_ light coming out!  The solution to that is to use clear
tail light lenses, possibly with red reflectors stuck on them to stay
within the law.
