Subject: RE: [VB] cb perf oil filter pump

Kevin,
I drove one in my 71 Westfailure for a couple of years and it was fine. I
used the short Mazda B2600 oil filter as the filter replacement. The only
mods I had to do was cut one little notch area in the upper tin to clear the
pump filter housing, and I used a header exhaust system with a QP muffler. I
have put many on dune buggies and other off road apps with no problems. Even
have one for my trike.
