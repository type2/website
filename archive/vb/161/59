Subject: Double Cab Floor Mat

Hey all,

	I'm currently pursuing a rear double cab floor mat.  The seller cannot find
a part number on the mat, but he does find a vw symbol.  I woudl expect the
mat to have a the correct 9 digit part number somewhere on the mat.

	Can any owners of a '66 or '67 double cab check their rear mat (passenger
area) to see if they can find a part number?  If you find it, what is it?

THANKS A BUNCH.
