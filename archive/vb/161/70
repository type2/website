Subject: Westy interior light lenses

I work at a plastics company and am repoping these lenses, you can see them 
here:

I would like to make the earlier clamshell style too, but I need an original to 
see if it is worth it and to make a mold from. If anyone is interested, the 
donor gets the original back along with the first set of new ones. p-mail me if 
your interested.
