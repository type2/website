Hi Sue,
Is your bulb turned in 180 degrees the wrong way?  Have you checked that bulb 
for both filaments in working condition?  Also check the individual wires for 
electricty getting through.  One wire is for running lights, the other is for 
turn & brake signals.

Could be your signal switch is bad or needs a good cleaning with electrical 
contact cleaner.  No, it just shows you have flashing signals.

Sounds like it only grounds through the engine lid prop arm now.  Try 
applying grease mixed with graphite to the latch and its catch.  Do the same 
for the other doors.  Graphite is a good conductor of electricity and even 
when the grease dries out the graphite is a good lubricant.  This will make 
your doors close easier without the need to slam them to death.
