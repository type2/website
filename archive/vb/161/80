Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Westy interior light lenses

  The late 66 I sold and the late 66 I parted had rectangle lights with the
switch in the mounting housing with lens that just snaped on. Both buses
were U S delivery and very original. The 64 I had did have clamshells in it
and a late 64 I looked at had the rectangle lens with the switch and
mounting holes through the lens and the same mounting as the clamshell
earlier lights. It seems that VW changed the lens style (to the rectangle)
in late 64/65 and maybe even early 66 then went to the snap in lens style in
late 66 and 67. I don't have the vins in front of me to verify the date of
the change. A good thing to look at when I go to the shows though.

i have a '66 Westy and my light doesnt have any holes in the lense... the 
push button switch is mounted on the right side?? is this because my 
interior is a euro-delivery? odd that the lights would be different tho.
