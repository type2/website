Subject: hit brakes, park lights come on

I have the german  head lights in my 59 and when I apply the brake my park 
lights come on inside the headlights. When the headlight switch is out for 
the parklights nothing changes that I can see.   Is this a ground problem?  
Or do I need to look elsewhere?
Thanks in advance \
