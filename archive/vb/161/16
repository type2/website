All,

Thanks for the many responses!  It's polish instead of rubbing compound
for the paint.  The nose insulation is apparently original, and I did
mess up when I said 1/4" thick - it's more like 3/16" or 1/8".  The
explanation of the synchros for first gear makes sense.  I'll try
clipping my 7mm wires into the factory wire holders and let you all know
how I make out.

Thanks again!

Matt Roberds
