Subject: Pulling the fuel line

Does anyone know if it will work, or tried the trick
of capping off the gas tank filler neck air tight. I
hate pulling the fuel line off when pulling the motor
cause of the gas that gets all over you, and its the
same thing when putting the motor back in. I have
heard of this done on the master cylinder when doing
brake work.
 Mike
