Subject: Cargo Door Weatherstrip

Hello List,
Almost done with the restoration of my 67 Sundial, but I've got a memory
problem.  I cleaned out the weatherstrip channels real good on the cargo
doors and on the channels where the doors close, and now I can't
remember which areas get the weatherstripping?  I have a total of 9
pieces, 4 short and 5 long.  Can anybody help me out with this one?

Thank you,
Ed
