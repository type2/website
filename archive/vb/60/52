Just recieved some rocker and floor sections from bus boys today....They are
the same orange panels as wol west and appear to be good quality...Service
was prompt and prices were great,esp with the 15% discount that expires
today....BTW I think that a used heater tube would be the only way to
go...lots of good used ones in the south...

Still grindin' on that 56 Kombi

Everyone have a great and bussy new year,
