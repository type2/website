Subject: 67 tipper driving impressions

Hi All,

I got the tipper out of the shop this morning and putted around town to show
a few friends.  I stopped by the body shop that did my double cab and showed
Eric.  He thought it was actually in much better shape than I first
described to him and he encouraged me not to do much but drive it.

While driving around, I noticed a few items:
- The brakes work great :-)
- The clutch pedal doesn't return all the way allowing the clutch to slip.
I can pull the pedal up with my foot which allows the clutch to engage.  So,
does this mean either the pedal pivot or the cable is stiff and not the
clutch?????
- I need to find wiper pivot shafts (both have been broken).  In my search,
what years will work?
- If you turn on the turn signals, as soon as the flasher unit tries to
blink the lights, the fuse blows.  The lights all work.  The emergency
flasher doesn't blink the lights also (I think at least).  Any thoughts of
where to look first?
- To answer Everett's question, it takes 51 pumps to reach the first stage
and 24 more to get the bed in it's highest position.

... oh yea, just how much do you all think I should lower it???? ... just
kidding :-)
