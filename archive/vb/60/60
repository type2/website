Thanks Clara,
I knew that I shouldn't try and answer a technical question while under the
influence of three different types of back medication.

I reread my comment and what made sense to me, didn't make sense if you turn
yourself upside down and work relative to the engine.  Rather than "bottom nut", I
should have used "first nut" or as in your way of always cutting to the heart of
the matter, the "one closest to the engine case".

Happy New Year!!!
Scott
