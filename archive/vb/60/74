So I got the 28 PCI on my bus today.  My bus hadn't been started in =
about a month and it has been quite Ontario cold (as opposed to Manitoba =
cold) for the last few weeks.  I tried to start it twice and no go - I =
then clamped the manual choke in on position and that bad boy started =
first try - no problem at all. I just have to hook up the choke cable, =
which is already in my bus, and I'll be cruisin'.  I'm reluctant to take =
it for a drive as there is already salt on the roads so I may have to =
wait for till the roads are relatively salt free before I start =
monitoring the jets. =20

My exhaust has been quite black when I was using the 28 PICT.  It was =
black it the tail pipes and on the spark plugs. There are only about =
10,000 mi on the rings and the exhaust has always been black so I'm =
assuming that I'm running too rich?  Is that likely?

I've read in the Idiot book that John Muir used a 28 PCI on his 63 bus =
and "probably had a 24 mm venturi and a 170 or 180 air correction jet."  =
He goes on to say: "the all out condition for the 28 PCI, as old Case =
says, is 145 main, 180 air correction and take out the replaceable =
venturi altogether making the venturi diameter about 28 mm."  I've also =
read that the 28 PCI was the carb of choice for formula vee racing in =
the late 60's.  There is a web site somewhere on which the tell how the =
carb was altered for formula vee racing.

So at this point I'll follow Muir's instructions and wipe out my tail =
pipes and drive my bus for about 100 mi and check the colour of the =
exhaust and make jet changes accordingly.  I still have the 21.5 (I =
think) venturi so it maybe that I'll have to hone that out to something =
bigger, maybe 22 mm to start, because I don't think I'll be able to =
locate a bigger venturi.

Advice appreciated.
