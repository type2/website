Is it red?  Empi made some form of transistor spark-o-matic thing in the
60's.  You see them on ebay and they rarely sell.  It has been my impression
from several that these things never really worked except to create a void
in the wallet ;-)

hey everyone-
i recently purchased a 62 beetle an found something interesting in the back
seat. it looked at first to be a small aplefier for a radio, but then i
showed it to someone and they said that they thought it looked like a heat
sink that you would hook up after you had put big gap spark plugs in for a
hotter spark. anybody know how these are hooked up, and what it needs to be
hooked up? it only came with the unit itself, about 6x5x4, made of of billet
aluminum with fins. thanks!
