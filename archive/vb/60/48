Subject: Tex trip in the 67

Happy New Year bus folk,
Got back from Christmas vacation/ door recovery trip in my 67 with no
major problems.  Bus did pretty good in some ways, not so good in others.
I cut off the heat log (thanks JP) and installed a bug heatbox/body tube,
then 4" dryer duct to a 4" fan then to the front seat.  Didn't really need
the fan and it makes alot of noise.  It was nice having that big hot air
supply up front instead of cooking my ice chest and boots etc. Heat was
good.  I had a roof rack with 5 gal. gas can and spare to Ft. Worth and
thanks to James and Tom Laney, a bunch of doors strapped on from there to
Austin and back to Albuquerque.  So the good part is with my 2L engine
with dual DCNFs in horrendous winds going down I was able to easily do 70
mph at 3700 rpm most all the way.  The bad part is that I got about 14-15
mpg.  At that speed with the roof rack and all I know it will take some
extra.  The DCNFs are willing to dump gas if you want, but I was hoping
for more mpg.  If I can make it to BBB I'll be interested in how it does
without a roof rack.  Oh I had a complete spare engine and lots of tools,
spares etc. loaded in too.  Any opinions on whether my mileage is
reasonable or way out of line? I've never gotten this bad of mileage on a
bus before.  I'm runnig 135 mains, 55 idles, 32 venturis.  Stock cam/heads
1.4 rockers.  It smells rich at idle, but as I recall, using 50 idles it
would lean out at 2-3000 rpm low load.
I think I'd like to put this engine in my 58 panel for an Alaska trip this
summer, but don't really want to do 6000 miles at 15mpg and would like to
do 75 (58 has 3.88 small nut) and not 65mph.

PS-totally locked up my trans in Lago Vista Tx.  Scared the christmas
stuffing out of me.  Jacked it up, popped it loose.  Next time maybe I'll
remember to tighten down the shifter.:) Bus died outside Llano, 0psi fuel
pressure on the gauge.  Started pulling gas lines, worked clear back to
the tank.  After all that I just needed to loosen the gas cap.  Next time
I'll do that first.  Maybe.
