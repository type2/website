     Well, said!  I myself had the joy of sitting though a term of color 
theory (can you say bored to tears!)  But the one thing that was driven home 
again and again was, everybody sees things differently.  There are so many 
variables. We did a test panel taped off into 12 sections.  We mixed up some 
blue and used that paint from just that one can, by varying air pressure, 
viscosity, spaying technique, different guns, and a few other things I don't 
remember. (you get 30 guys spraying and theirs lots of fumes)  anyway we had 
a panel that looked like it had 12 different blues on it.  
     My '58 was Sealing Wax Red at one time, basically all that's left is the 
vent system and the inside of the roof.  I see a fair amount of orange and 
possible some yellow to it too.  But when paint gets that old it changes 
physically.  So short of finding a Sealing Wax Red Bus in a dark vacuum 
somewhere, We'll just have to shoot for as close as we can, and just deal 
with it not being the prefect color, but damn close.
                                                                     Peace,
