Hi All,

As they say, what you do on Jan. 1, you'll do for the rest of the year.
Accordingly, I tricked my 14 year old daughter to go over to the garage and
we mounted the spindles on the front beam and then jacked it up into
position.  The wooden cradle I made for the beam worked just great by
putting it on top of the floor jack and then raising the whole thing into
position.  Once in, a few bolts went in to hold it and we dropped the jack
out.  Slicker than anything!  I've got some incentive to get the double cab
to the 'rolling stage' so I can get it back down to the body shop for a few
touch ups otherwise while there is a few weeks break in the shops space.
Hopefully I'll get there!  Then it's concentrating on putting it back
together and narrowing the rear axles.
