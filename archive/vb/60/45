Subject: Re: [VB] Sheet Metal for 65' bus- more questions 

Hi! New guy on the list (reactivated '67 13-window Deluxe in Phila. Pa.
area)...

I was distressed to read the negative reports on body panel quality, since I
just made the commitment to fix the body right. Lots of questions: Is it the
whole group's concensus that BFY's panels are best? What variety does The
Bus Depot sell (they're local for me, but seem more focused on later buses)?
Schofield in the U.K. seems to offer pieces that the others do not -- does
he sell to the U.S.? It seems only RMMW offers a heater tube in the U.S.,
but it's only 36" long and very expensive -- what's the deal? (I need the
whole straight tube, plus the angled piece just ahead of it that comes down
from over the front beam.)

Finally, is anyone on the list from the Philadelphia area? Know of any shops
in the area that have done bus body restoration work?

Thanks in advance!

-- Rich
