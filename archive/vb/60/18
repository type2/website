From http://www.ploon.nl

===============================

Send your VIN number and 20,- DM to
the museum accepts CASH in the equivalent of 20 DM as payment,
so there is no need to get currency changed. allow 4 weeks for processing.

Address:
Vehicle Identity Certificate
STIFTUNG AUTOMUSEUM VOLKSWAGEN
Dieselstrabe 35 - 38446 Wolfsburg, Germany

and you will recieve a verry nice document which states:
Build date, delivery date, destination of delivery, along with the original
color of the paintwork and interior and any factory fitted extras

===============================
