So I'm testing out the 28 PCI and if it doesn't work I'll have to go =
back to me 28 PICT.  If I do go back I expect that I'll set up the 28 =
PICT to work as a manual choke.  It doesn't look too complicated. =20

Anyway, the 28 PICT had a spacer thing under it  that made the carb sit =
too high.  I had to jamb my oil bath air cleaner on because it hit the =
top of my engine compartment.  So I had a machine shop take about 1/4" =
off the spacer so my oil bath air cleaner will fit better.  How should =
this affect how my carb works?  I was running rich, I suspect, so will =
making this spacer smaller make me run leaner, less lean, or no =
difference?

TIA
