Subject: [VB] Re: What is sealing wax red?

Okies for brevity- any one have a lead of glassurit, speiss hocker (sp?) =
etc. mixing codes for some of our fave colours such as

velvet grun, pearl white, "ceiling" wax red etc. etc.

I have an original swatch of OG sealing wax red that I could use as a =
template i suppose but would actually lke to find some mixing codes.

The smart a** in me wants to reply, "It's an over used, cliche' color".

The more mature side of me wishes to encourage folks to go do a web-search =
or
even go to an old-school analog library and research color theory.
Specifically, I mention the effect of any given color when placed next to
another (or not). Secondly, remember how the perception of any color =
"changes"
from a 2 inch by 2 inch sample (on cardboard) vs. being applied onto an =
entire
large surface, ie a (metal with primer on it) bus.
Compare anyone's mixture of SWR out of the same hypothetical can of paint =
and
apply it onto a panel bus and a beetle of whatever year you imagine.
Compare a 100% velvet green camper to a hypothetically over touted green =
and
white one. The Velvet Grn will/may "look" differently between the two =
vehicles.
Suppose that the first two-toned bus had the green/white paint sprayed =
directly
onto primer. Then paint L82 Pearl above the belt line onto the previously =
100%
green bus. The pearl of the second bus may be affected by the underlying =
green
vs. the grey primer of the first bus. Yeah OK who cares about Velvet and =
white
in this discussion. I was only making a point. Sealing wax red next to =
white
will look different to SWR next to any attempt at Chestnut brown.
Add polished aluminum, brown upholstery, white steering whls and fat white
walls and insert trim- and the perception will also be different.

Take a breath and then get into Additive and Subtractive color theory, =
printed,
projected, wet vs dry of the same mixture. Two coats the exact mixture of =
pearl
white paint on one panel and not on another of the same vehicle? Perception=

change? You betcha! Print it in a magazine or display it in a movie/TV =
show and
get it exactly right? Forget it! That is a rough representation and can be
messed up in a thousand ways. =20

If you aren't bored out of your skull yet, then imagine the effects of the =
same
exact mixture of automotive paint from brand to brand. I'd guess that you =
will
have a subtle shift. Single stage vs. the same color under the second =
stage of
clear? Dull vs shiny? Perception change? Perhaps.

Warm vs. Cool- Tint vs. Shade: Don't even mention the blue based (cool) =
red of
the late 60's bays that had an RCH of black in it vs. the warm yellow =
based
Porsche Guards (Gaards) red. Major difference!

I recently had the opportunity to see a bus in a tippy top secret locale =
that
had OG factory Sealing Wax Red on the area above the visors, where the =
mohair
deluxe headliner (with all kinds of holes in it) used to be and up into =
the
fresh air duct work. To me it appeared more Coral, damned near pink with a
teeny skosh of orange and black spooged into it. To the person that I was =
with
it seemed gray. He's color blind. The color was similar to the rubbed out =
OG
deluxe that Mark L. brought to the Summer OCTO a few years ago, not the =
overly
glossy nasty yellow-red waving at ya sack of walnuts looking Tijuana
bondo-mobile imitation deluxe knock-off that was at Pomona later that same
season.=20

Sealing wax? How many young folks have even SEEN sealing wax and know what =
it
was used for? On this list I am amazed that no one has started calling the =
chit
"Ceiling Wax" red. Place the Coral next to the imaginary perfectly =
formulated
Chestnut (with the exact amount of black in it) and the SWR of your dreams =
will
look different once again. Even the row of nicely done deluxe Barndoors at =
the
OCTO several years ago were somewhat different.

God Bless the talented and proud who have-presently are-and are planning =
to mix
the Mothers Milk and attempt to please everyone. Pfft, Please!=20

Being serious for a second, I salute the folks who have done incredible =
work
combining the SWR and CB and sharing them with us at places like the Duck =
Pond.
Time, sweat, love-hate, talent and finances involved orchestrated into a
cohesive result is the real trick. Sitting behind a keyboard and being =
blowhard
provocateur is the easy part. Bottom line? Use Michael Hornbecker's OG =
deluxe
as a benchmark if you are ever lucky enough to see it.
