     It's pretty rare but every now and then, a torsion leave will crack.  
But I would first check out want kind of play you have in your king and link 
pins.  If they check out, then I'd move to the trailing arm bearings, 
although when they go bad you really get a fairly loud "clunk" out of them 
going down the road.  If you do end up swapping beams, be sure to replace the 
washers for the anchor bolts in the same direction that they came off.  You 
might also think about doing your swing lever while the beam is out (a lot 
easier!!)
