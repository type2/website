First of all, Happy New Year to all.

Just finished putting my bus back together.  Been out of commission
since late August.

Can anyone give me any advice on aligning the doors on my 67 Sundial?  I
replaced the drivers side door, since the bottom hinge was tearing off
of my old door.  In the process, I guess I now need to re-align the
door.  Actually I need to do both doors, I think.  Putting the new
weatherstripping on has made it about impossible to open and close the
doors without slamming them.  Can anyone tell me how long it takes for
the rubber to get mashed down enough to where it's not so hard to close
the doors?  And what about the alignment of the doors?  Sometimes, it
sounds like it's metal to metal contact when I close the doors.  Could
that simply be the latch hitting the striker plate?  The Bently Manual
has little or no advice on aligning doors.

Thank you,
Ed
