Subject: Trailer pictures and some help on it

I just uploaded to VW planet some pictures of my
trailer.  It is preaty cool. It folds up into a suit
case size for storrage.  The blue cover breaks down
and stores seperatly.  Since i have my hitch on now, i
can use the trailer.  

Does anyone know of a canvas shop that could help me
make a new cover for it?  I would like to get one made
for this trailer that is similar in color to my bus. 
I would prefure in the So. Cal area, but can ship the
current blue cover anywhere to have the new top made.

thanks
