Some like to tap into the oil system here for a cooler or filter.

Safety wire means never having to say you're sorry.

For leaking, I wouldn't use teflon tape.  Better to use some sort of 
fuel and oil proof sealant like hylomar.

Is it a tapered thread?  If so, screw it in until snug.

I question the use of a block-off at all.  What is wrong with the stock 
oil cooler?  Unless you have built a monster engine, the stock oil 
cooler should be more than adequate.  Hard to beat a multi-layer fan-
forced cooler.
