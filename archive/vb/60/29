 I went to take a look at a 59 Panel this guy in town had for sale that
 didn't have an M-plate either. it was in the high 500,000's, but my April 59
 Micro has one. weird?

yes that is wierd, as the  m code plates were started as of about ch 398 xxx. 
 However, my first splitty was a 59 and had no m code tag, was  i think 446 
xxx. 36hp originally.   It had the body number stamped in, it was not that 
the tag was removed.  It was a typoe 211 that had been camperized at some 
point, FWIW.

I am glad to hear of some other 59 that did not come with m code tag
