I put a CDI module on a bus in the mid seventies that was about this size.
It seemed to work ok, but if you figure that the thing is about the same
age, it might be better to leave it disconnected.  Just one more unknown.
As to how it would hook up, I remember needing the instructions.  There
wasn't any way to tell what went where except matching the wire color to
the instruction sheet.
