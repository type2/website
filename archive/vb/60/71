Subject: Oil Cooler Block Off Plate

I am installing an oil cooler block off plate, and I have a few questions I 
hope some of you can help me with.  First, let me describe the plate:

It is a flat plate with a U-shaped hump for the flow-through tube.  The 
"hump" has a hex-plug that provides access to the flow-through chamber.

Now, the questions:

1. Why is there a plug here rather than having a solid U-shaped hump for the 
pass through?

2. What is the likelihood of this plug leaking, and other than teflon tape 
and lock tight, how do I insure that it doesn't leak or even come out?

3.  Should I screw in this plug all of the way until it bottoms out, or 
should I screw it in only part way to avoid blocking off part of the oil 
flow?

4. Is there perhaps another block off I should be using?  (i.e. is this 
design a little faulty or are there better block-offs I should be using)

Thanks for your help, all!
