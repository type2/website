Along these lines, http://manual.gimp.org/manual/GUM/Part_four.html and
especially http://manual.gimp.org/manual/GUM/Prepress.html deal with
a subset of this: how to get an image that looks good on your computer
monitor to come out of a printing press looking approximately the same
way.  The basic thing I get out of all of this is "it ain't easy".

TV manufacturers faced similar problems when color TVs first came out.
Put a color TV in a room and ask each of ten people to adjust every
knob until it "looks right" and you will end up with 11+ different
sets of settings.  They tried all kinds of tricks but even the TV
you bought yesterday still has "color" and "tint" controls.

Yes to both.

This was originally what I thought it was, by analogy with "floor
wax" and the Puff the Magic Dragon song.

Also in the direction of Bus painting, see pages 15-16 of "VW Bus"
by Keith Seume.  The OG paint process was approximately: acid dip
(cleaning), phosphate dip (anti-rust), hand rub the entire body,
spray primer, spray the first color, and (if two colors) mask off
the bottom and respray.  (The top first/bottom first/dash same color
as top or bottom is a whole other thread).
