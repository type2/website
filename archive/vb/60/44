Subject: RE: Sealing Wax Red

It may have been a tricky color for VW as well--

My 63 23 and my 1960DC were both original L53 Sealing Wax Red--
Yet comparing the color of the dash and engine compartment, they were not a
perfect match-- Comparing the outside body color would not be fair as to the
degree the both buses suffered due to being outside and their age--Perhaps
locating various SWR ash trays at swap meets might prove interesting?, TWWM,
