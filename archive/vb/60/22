sweeeet!  Good to hear that the site is going to be back on track soon.

I'll also take this moment to commend the site-typers as well as any member of their
background-brigade, whom may not be known, on a job well done; SV2s is one of the cleanest, more
functional, and overall well done VW sites that's on the web, to date.  Although I don't visit
frequently enough to be the first one to catch the mishap, I do often go there and have it linked
from my geocities site.

May everyone's new year be hacker, spam, and virus free!
