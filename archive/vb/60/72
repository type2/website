Subject: Re: [VB] screw size


Thanks. Found it in the parts manual. AM 3.5 X 5 The manual didn't list any
sizes for different years, but I know Wolfsburg West also lists an oversize
screw for this application.
Many Thanks
Chris

 what year?  You might want to check out the parts manual on vintagebus.com.

 Does anyone know the size and thread pitch of the
screw that holds the pop-out window frame to the hinge on the body?
