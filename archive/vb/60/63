Subject: Reserve lever mounting Q

Has anyone ever added a reserve lever to there bus? A
bus that did not originally come with one?  I am
trying to add one to my deluxe right now and am
pondering how to attach the cable near the tank.  I
have to lever installed and routed and also have the
valve installed.  I think VW had a mount point for
there units originally.  Anyone out there fab
something up for there bus?  This is for a 1965
microbus.

Thanks

Matthew
