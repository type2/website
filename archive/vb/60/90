Subject: RE: [VB] 67 tipper driving impressions

thanks for the tips... I'll look into the flasher ground.  It does as you
assumed.  The tipper was in Germany all its life and it looks like the
flasher relay box was meant to be there... there again, I only looked at it
briefly.

I am assuming you mean that the lights come on as soon as you hit the
switch but when it's time for them to click off the fuse blows.  I
would look first for DPO creativity in the area of the turn signal
flasher.  In particular, the '67 Euro wiring diagram shows a separate
ground wire for the flasher which should go (only) to terminal 31 on
the flasher.  If your flasher doesn't have a terminal 31 (most aftermarket
flashers don't) then unhook the ground wire.

>The emergency flasher doesn't blink the lights also (I think at least).

This bus was originally Euro spec, right?  If so the emergency flasher
switch *may* have been a DPO addition.  If you get the turn signals
working then the emergency flasher may follow.

*IF* this Bus has a 9-prong box you can follow my write-up at
http://www.type2.com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html , but if it's
Euro-spec it wouldn't have had one of these originally.
