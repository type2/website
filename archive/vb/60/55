Subject: Re: [VB] NC Appraiser needed

The insurance company (AIG) says that they don't go by the NADA because it
is a broad generalization of values. They do "Market surveys" of local
values within a 20 -50 mile radius.. How they do this I don't know because I
drive the ONLY bus in Concord NC and there are very few(that I know of) on
the road in the surrounding area.
As far as real world values go they don't use them because: "just because a
person asks a price doesn't mean that it is worth that much" and "the
internet has cars from all over the United Stated and we are determining a
value for you area".
Also the supervisor said they I put to much emphasis on the lack of rust on
my bus , he says that good paint and no dints and dings is more important.
So I said that when I get done having to weld the floors, rocker,
doglegs,and corners on a replacement bus I will end up ruining that shiny
macco job by priming the new metal.   Oh yea...he also says "I was a British
Leyland mechanic , I know vintage cars"
