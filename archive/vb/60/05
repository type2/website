Subject: Re: [VB] Strange, rear, windows, on, a, crewcab

The large rear window is pretty uncommon as far as trucks go. What was it,
66 and 67 trucks that had the big rear window? Or was it just 67? Don't
recall, but you don't see many. Splitty wise, I mean. The bays had the big
one. The rest of them had the same small rear window as a barndoor had. Not
rectangular, the sides angled in towards the top. There is also a square
with cross breaks on it, kind of an X thing on the sheet metal on both sides
of the window. It's about 8 inches square or so. I have seen those squares
hacked out and windows added in the holes. Nasty thing to fix, I reckon. I
am assuming that is what you are describing.
