hey everyone-
i recently purchased a 62 beetle an found something interesting in the back seat. it looked at first to be a small aplefier for a radio, but then i showed it to someone and they said that they thought it looked like a heat sink that you would hook up after you had put big gap spark plugs in for a hotter spark. anybody know how these are hooked up, and what it needs to be hooked up? it only came with the unit itself, about 6x5x4, made of of billet aluminum with fins. thanks!
