Subject: Carb draft tube Q, 1965 Samba 1500 motor

Does anyone out there have a picture or any info on
the steel draft tube that is mounted at the end of the
air clearner paper draft tube?  It somehow directs
warm air up to the carb from under the motor.  I have
a picture of it in my parts book, but it does not show
how or where it mounts.

any info out there?

Thanks

Matthew
