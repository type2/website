Nick your bus doesnt have a M-plate cause its was made before M-plates
started (I assume your bus is an early october)

As dicussed on other lists recently with persons that have recently obtained
info, they also will accept personal check made out to  "Stiftung AutoMuseum
Volkswagen" or your credit card number with cardholder name, card number,
type of card, and the expiration date. With a credit card or check you will
get charged whatever the exchange rate happens to be the day they process it
but less hassle of doing the conversion yourself.
Here is the address posted which has a couple of extra tidbits on the
address that Ploon's info doesn't have.

Stiftung AutoMuseum Volkswagen
Brieffach 1003
Frau Neefe
Dieselstrasse 35
D-38436 Wolfsburg Germany
