Lots of folks throw out the vacuum advance dizzy as an "upgrade" I've been
given a few good ones over time.

Hello list,
I'm considering replacing my 009 dizzy in my 67 Sundial (1600 sp) with the
correct Vacuum dizzy for the year of my engine.

Are distributors rebuildable?  How can I tell if one that I'm considering
can be rebuilt?  If I find a good used candidate, I'm worried that someone
took it out because it was bad, and probably replaced it with a 009.

I'm convinced that changing the dizzy, along with rebuilding my original
carb, will give me more power without flat spots, and better fuel economy.
Currently, I'm getting around 18-20 mpg.

Anyone have any thoughts on this change-over.  I've printed out everything I
can find on the subject from the internet, but is there a certain model
dizzy that I should look for?

TIA,
Ed
