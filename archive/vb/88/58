Hello list,
I'm considering replacing my 009 dizzy in my 67 Sundial (1600 sp) with =
the correct Vacuum dizzy for the year of my engine.

Are distributors rebuildable?  How can I tell if one that I'm =
considering can be rebuilt?  If I find a good used candidate, I'm =
worried that someone took it out because it was bad, and probably =
replaced it with a 009.

I'm convinced that changing the dizzy, along with rebuilding my original =
carb, will give me more power without flat spots, and better fuel =
economy.  Currently, I'm getting around 18-20 mpg.

Anyone have any thoughts on this change-over.  I've printed out =
everything I can find on the subject from the internet, but is there a =
certain model dizzy that I should look for?

TIA,
Ed
