Cut the corner up to about 1mm fromt he seam, and then you can drill
the welds out frm that point, without all the extra metal in the way.
Or, if you're a good welder, just section the piece you need.  Not
having seen your project (although there's a vintagebus.com gallery
section just for projects!) I can't advise further.
