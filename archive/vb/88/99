       Something else you'll need to change out is the heat exchangers, as 
the levers for the bus are different from bug.   Also, if my tired brain 
remembers right, your bus engine will have a "D" crank pulley on it.  These 
pulleys where a little bigger than the bug to spin the fan faster to keep the 
temp down on the buses.  Also, while the engines out it would be a good time 
for any clutch and throw out bearing work.  I'd also give the gas lines from 
the tank a good look and replace the starter bushing just for peace of mind.
                                                                           
Peace,
