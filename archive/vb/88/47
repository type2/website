Subject: Re: [VB] body panel removal

I simply want to replace the entire driver side rear corner with the new 
panel I have. I can borrow pretty much whatever tool I need to do it from 
relatives or the local shop. I am just curious how to get the seam apart all 
the way around, what types of welds and such. It sounds like removing all 
the metal would make it alot easier.
