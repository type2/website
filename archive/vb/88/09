Subject: Re: [VB] cleaning engine compartment


I have used both oven cleaner and engine degreaser with no problems,They 
make some easy off stuff that is supposedly fume free that I had no prob 
with on my bus.I as a general rule use the castrol degreaser ,(mainly 
because I have heard other horror stories of the oven cleaner eating 
everything).It has worked pretty well,the best stuff going is probably from 
Griots(sp?)I borrowed some from a friend and it was AMAZING!Eastwood 
probably has some really good stuff also.
Good luck.......
