Subject: Re: [T2] Minnesota VW swap meet???

As of the last club meeting, 6 February 2002, it had not been decided yet.  
At that time we we not even sure where the meetings are going to be after 
this month since West Side Volkswagen has been bought by Rudy Luther, who 
also owns Burnsvilee Volkswagen.

After the next meeting, tomorrow, I'll post when and where it will be.
