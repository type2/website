I'm going to try to remember all the crap I leaned and pass it on, so you
guys out there who really know your stuff be kind in your corrections.

Is your transmission the original (6 volt)? If it is you will have to cut
some clearance in the bell housing. This is not hard to do. If you put in
the engine and hook up the electrical, take the wire off the coil so it
won't start, put in the bolts just a little, turn the engine over just a
little. The hard steel flywheel will cut into the soft metal of the bell
housing and show you where to cut. You can actually continue to tighten,
turn the engine and cut the metal to compltion, but that made me nervous.
You will also need a special bushing on the starter. It is thicker than the
standard 6volt one. A 12 volt starter for an automatic will eliminate that
hassle.

Did I do right, guys?

> Thanks Thom.  So, let me see if if I understand the article.  My 12 Volt
engine is turnkey complete, so it already has a 12 volt generator (or is it
alternator?), coil, and choke, no problem there.  So according to the info,
I should be able to put the 6 volt flywheel and clutch onto the 12 volt
engine, then simply put the engine into the 1966 bus and use existing 6 volt
starter and bell housing configuration and operate the bus off of a 12 volt
power source?  That seems WAY too easy, am I missing something?  What about
voltage regulator, that would have to be change to a 12 Volt, right?
Obviously all bulbs, relays, etc would need to be switched over, but there
has got to be something I'm not thinking of, otherwise it's too simple!
