Hi Sean,
I just e-mailed them about the Dillons Beach campout that they put on. It 
happens to be next weekend over St. Patrick's day.

I'll be heading up that way in my deluxe if you want to caravan up that may. 
Probably gonna make it a saturday day trip though if you're interested.

Let me know,
