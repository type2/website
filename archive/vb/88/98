Subject: Re: [VB] Eriba Puck Door Key

There is a guy selling blanks, I think he's got an ad on the eriba friends
message board or what ever its called.  if you go to aol.com and use their
search engine it usually comes up on the first page or so. If this doesn't
work I'll take my key to the local lock smith and see if I can find a
matching blank, I dont like the idea of sending my only and original key out
into the usps.
