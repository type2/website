PCA allows 356's to be autcrossed, but requires a camber comensator.  Pre-a
cars must upgrade to the later suspension in front.  So you could probably
get away with a big sway bar and camber compensator.  SCCA specifically
excludes certain cars from competition (the Montero comes to mind) - not
sure of the bus is on that list.  3-point belts are also required.
