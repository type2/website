Subject: Identifying a limited slip tranny

From the Thing list...

Yes. "AV" transaxles were fitted on IRS Things but didn't have limited =
slip=20
differential.

"AW"=3D IRS with limited slip differential, ring and pinion 8X33
"AV" =3D IRS without limited slip differential, ring and pinion 8X33

Another way to know if  a transaxle has a limited slip differential is =
to=20
look at oil filling nut. If you can see "SPEZIAL OIL - SPERRDIFF./LIMITED=
=20
SLIP DIFF.", there are good chances that this transaxle has a limited =
slip=20
differential.
