Subject: RE: [VB] Hot Wiring a Bus

John,

My 65' beetle was bought 'hot-wired'.  You can follow this procedure:

If the switch is missing altogether, look for three wires.  If it is not
missing, those three wires will be connected to the switch.  I believe there
are two wires of one gauge, and a fatter wire making up the third.  Connect
the two thin wires.  This would be the first position on the switch.  Look
for your oil, and generator idiot lights.  This is not a guarantee however,
as they may very well need to be replaced.  With these two wires connected,
your points will be closed so don't leave them that way if the bus doesn't
start.  Now take the third wire(the fat one) and touch the first two.  That
kicks the starter over.  I drove that beetle that way for about 6~ months.
When you are done driving the car, UN-hook the first two wires.

Have fun...

The 66 Kombi I just picked up has been sitting in a lumber yard for a VERY
long time.  So it goes to figure that the ignition key is missing in action.
I will eventually get around to getting either a new key or a new switch,
but I am going to want to crank it soon so i can see if the current engine
appears salvageable.  So I was wondering if anyone could tell me how to hot
wire start thie bus.  I assume you can jump a wire between between the
battery and starter some how, but does anyone know specificaly how to do
this? Maybe some of you California guys have done this before! Just Kidding
;^)
