Subject: Bug engine in a Split bus

Can someone tell me things that must be considered (other than 6 v, 12 volt stuff) when putting a 1600 DP Beetle engine into a 66 Kombi that has the original (and apparently seized) 1500 engine in it now.  I heard there is some type of bracket or hanger that connects to the oil pump cover plate??  Or is that just for putting a T1 engine in a T4 bus?? can anyone share experiences of their own?
