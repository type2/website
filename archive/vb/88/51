depends. the 6v will fit, but what is the reason 
for wanting to change the flywheel other than maybe not wanting to grind the 
bellhousing? 

you really need to check for mainbearing play in 
the case first. remove flywheel and all shims and have another person yank on 
the crankshaft pulley while you feel the bearing and the case (at the same time 
with one finger) to feel for any movement. if it moves, you'll have troubles 
setting end play correctly. second, if the bearing doesn't move, and even if it 
does, you'll need to reset endplay. does your 6V flywheel have an o-ring like 
the 12V? either way, the absolute most important thing will be to get the 
endplay set correctly. if the bearing moves, you may be best off leaving the 12v 
flywheel on the engine and not change any settings, as the engine will be 
needing a rebuild at a future point. you'll also have to change the starter to a 
6V unit to have correct mesh of the starter gear teeth and the flywheel. 6 and 
12v are not compatible. this also means you'll have to change to the correct 
starter bushing of the 4 that are available (straight 6, straight 12, 6 to 12, 
12 to 6). you may also have to grind the internal diameter of the transmission 
bellhousing for the 12V sized flywheel. (be careful not to remove too 
much.

other things to change when going from 6 to 12 (or 
12 to 6 for that matter): every light bulb on the car, coil, choke (if in use), 
any electrical cut-off or idle jets on the carb if applicable, generator, 
voltage regulator, wiper motor or use any kind of appropriate voltage reducer, 
battery, starter (to match teeth). then there is the gas gauge 
debate..........

things that do NOT need to be changed: points, 
condenser, spark plugs, any electrical wiring, dash switches.

good luck

OK, 
I have a good 12 Volt 1600 Dp engine which I want to put into a 6 volt 66 Kombi. 
Can I really just take the 6 volt flywheel and put it on the 12 volt 
engine?  What else would need to be changed out?  Voltage 
Regulator, Bulbs, Wiper motor?
