Subject: [VB] Hot Wiring a Bus


The 66 Kombi I just picked up has been sitting in a lumber yard for a VERY long time.  So it goes to figure that the ignition key is missing in action.  I will eventually get around to getting either a new key or a new switch, but I am going to want to crank it soon so i can see if the current engine appears salvageable.  So I was wondering if anyone could tell me how to hot wire start thie bus.  I assume you can jump a wire between between the battery and starter some how, but does anyone know specificaly how to do this? Maybe some of you California guys have done this before! Just Kidding ;^)
