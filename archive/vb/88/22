Could be T4 1700 P&Cs from a 411/412.  I know they have a pretty big dome on
them and would look similar to a T1 piston in size w/o really inspecting it
close up.  With the FI the 411/412 ran something like 9.3:1 compression
ratio...  In looking at the pistons it is a miracle it is not an
interference designed motor! :)

The above probably applies to the 914 engines as well, but I cannot say for
sure.  

All the stock NOS sets I have seen this way are KS (Kobleschmidt - SP).
