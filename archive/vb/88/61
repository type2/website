Subject: Re: [VB] Vacuum Advance Dizzy

Are distributors rebuildable?  How can I tell if one that I'm considering
can be rebuilt?  If I find a good used candidate, I'm worried that someone
took it out because it was bad, and probably replaced it with a 009.

 .. Yes. I know a guy on the T3 list that rebuilds them regularly. He
 .. has plenty of parts so, I'm sure he could rebuild anything you find.

I'm convinced that changing the dizzy, along with rebuilding my original
carb, will give me more power without flat spots, and better fuel economy.
Currently, I'm getting around 18-20 mpg.

.. The guy that does the rebuilds says the vacuum advance dist is
.. definitely superior on the FI engines. I don't know about carbureted
.. engines.
