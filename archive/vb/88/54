You might want to try turning the engine manually with a wrench on the
generator or crankshaft nut.  This will tell you if it's totally siezed
or not.  I have _heard_ that if the rings are rusted to the piston or
cylinder, just hitting it with the starter can break the rings, but I
have no idea how true this is.

Outside of that, the only thing I have to add to the electrical advice
is: if you do hot-wire it at the ignition switch, be careful to not
let the fat red wire short out on the dash, column, etc.  This is an
unfused feed directly from the battery, and I can guarantee you that
it will melt before the battery runs down.
