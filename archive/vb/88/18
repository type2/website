Christopher,

The guy who did my liner used material from Mercedes
Benz.  (Dave Lumeta in Sunland CA)  It is thinker (8mm
rather then 4mm) then the stuff the kit's come with
and has a feal of quality to it.  If you are in the LA
area i can give his number and you can talk to him in
person.

Hope that helped
Matthew
