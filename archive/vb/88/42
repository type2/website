Subject: Bugpack & spark plugs

Hi. I've been getting the camper ready for spring travel & show season, and thought I'd tap into the list wisdom on spark plugs. I'm running a 1600 single port, 009, 30/31 carb, and a pertronix ignitor w/ high output coil, and also the Jacob's Bugpak electronic ignition module. It says to use copper core plugs, gap to (I think) .05", and then experiment with the gap to optimize. I'm using NGK copper core plugs, and must have regapped the plugs 10 times after installing the darn thing, and never really got any kind of super optimum situation. I would run through a tank of gas, figure out the mileage, and then re-gap. 
  Anyway, as I get ready to put in new plugs, just wondering what other volks were doing in a similar situation. Any tips, hints, etc, besides lots of re-gapping? Why again must we use the copper plugs? I got tired of redoing the plugs time after time, especially the #1 & 3...and I never really found that super power or mileage increase they promised.
Anyway, just wondering...
