Subject: A Friday Question...

Have you ever been conflicted between Reading Acts 2:17-21, drinking your fifth
FatTire Amber Ale, Listening to L7 "Sh*tList/Burn", wanting to learn the lead
guitar to the Cowboy Junkies version to "Sweet Jane", selling/keeping your best
bus and really wanting to provide for your family? Hahahahahah! Didn't think
so...
Um, nevermind.
