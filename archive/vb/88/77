Subject: Various MC notes for conversion to bay unit

> A few notes on the conversion of the single chamber MC in the split to a
> later disk brake baywindow MC.
> 
> Eric & Barb have a great write-up on this process in the Library section.
> Please be familiar with that article to get an idea of what I am doing the
> same or differently than they outline.
> 
> Also note this is not installed yet and the actual installation will take
> place in a few weeks when other associated front brake parts arrive.
> 
> Okay I am starting with a Wolfgang International conversion kit (Part
> Number 2611011 www.wolfgangint.com ).  I spoke with Steve there who was
> very helpful in comparing the information Eric&Barb gave to what this kit
> either eliminates or makes more complicated.  The kit is basically a
> spacer for the MC so that the piston rod does not need to be altered and
> matching longer bolts.  This keeps all of the components as stock as
> possible if you decide to switch back to the single chamber MC.

> Some list members have said they have gotten this same kit locally at
> their VW FLAPS, but I have never seen this kit outside of the Wolfgang
> webpage.  I assumed it was an EMPI part, but it is not in their 2001
> dealer catalog either.

> The largest difference in Eric&Barbs instructions is that Wolfgang
> recommends removing the front brake light sensor and putting the front
> line directly in that hole.  This eliminates the need for a "T" fitting.
> We will see what happens when I install it...

> As I previously mentioned the Porsche 924 fluid reservoir is a perfect fit
> for this application and holds more fluid than the Rabbit fluid holder...
> This is what happens when you hang out in the junkyard too much :)

> The final plan entails the addition of early Porsche 944 front disc brakes
> to my '66.  The calipers are the easiest to rebuild and use that I have
> ever seen!  The rotors are massive at 11+ some odd inches (same rotors on
> the 911) and should provide enough grip to embarrass some SUVs.   Please
> contact Old Speed http://www.oldspeed.com/service.htm for more
> information, they have been very helpful.  Also if anyone is interested I
> have extra front calipers and good used rotors left over, make me a
> reasonable offer and yes it is WAY less than Old Speed would charge.  The
> kit gets cheap when you supply your own stuff :)
> 
> The rear brakes are still a puzzle I am trying to put together.  For the
> short term I will try the EMPI adapter plates to Porsche 5 lug, but it is
> a poor long term solution.  Really want to install 944 rear brakes and 944
> MC, but have not found a good way yet w/o serious and expensive
> changes....  At stock height with 215/75R15 tires...  Yah that is the
> killer, if I wanted 3" drop it would be a very easy conversion.

> Hopefully this post will be inspirational and thought provoking to someone
