Subject: [VB]  6 volt  to 12 volt conversion, is it that easy?

Thanks Thom.  So, let me see if if I understand the article.  My 12 Volt engine is turnkey complete, so it already has a 12 volt generator (or is it alternator?), coil, and choke, no problem there.  So according to the info, I should be able to put the 6 volt flywheel and clutch onto the 12 volt engine, then simply put the engine into the 1966 bus and use existing 6 volt starter and bell housing configuration and operate the bus off of a 12 volt power source?  That seems WAY too easy, am I missing something?  What about voltage regulator, that would have to be change to a 12 Volt, right? Obviously all bulbs, relays, etc would need to be switched over, but there has got to be something I'm not thinking of, otherwise it's too simple!
Thanks, John Baker
