Subject: intake manifold stud spacing

Hi All,

I was picking through a pile of heads the other day and noticed that some of
the single port heads have intake manifold studs that are ~1cm closer
together than others...  what is what?   It seems that all the vintage speed
manifolds that I have are for the heads with the closer spaced studs.
