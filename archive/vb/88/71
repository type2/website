Subject: RE: [VB] body panel removal

If I am going to remove a panel that I am not going to reuse and want to get
at the seams where the spot welds are this is how I do it'

If the bus is empty I will take my plasma cutter and cut just outside of the
seams. If the bus still has all it;s goodies inside I use my can opener on
my air chisel to slice it off.

Once I have all my seams exposed I will take my die grinder with a 3M
bristle
disc and clean all the surfaces to expose the spot welds.

Instead of drilling out every spot weld which will also leave holes in the
old surface I will need to spot weld to again, I use a 3M weld buster wheel
(4" green ginding wheels) on my die grinder and grind off the spot weld to
the metal I need to weld to. Using the grinder I can do about 5 spot welds
this way in the time it take to do 1 drilling them out and it leaves me a
clean weldable surface.

To reweld on the old panel I have numerous different jaws for my spotwlder
and can reach just about anywhere with it for the factory spot weld look.

Piece of cake
