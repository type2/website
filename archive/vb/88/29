Hi Adrian,
Depends on what R&P and tire size you are using.  Generally if you are using 
a 4.375 R&P with stock diameter tires you will notice about 3MPH drop.  With 
3.975 R&P and stock diameter tires it be more like 6 MPH drop.  

>>I am assuming the difference in gearing for the early splits was in the
transmission itself and not the RGBs? <<

Incorrect!
