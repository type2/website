Subject: Nov/Dec VW Autoist Magazine(#404)

If any of you get VW Autoist magazine from the VW Club of America there is a
article in there about my truck and it being made into the Johnny Lighting SC.
Jerry Jess wrote the article and sent me a photocopy but I would like a real
copy if they are out there to be had.   Thanks Jerry!!!!!
Thanks

"All journeys end when we reach our destination but the journeying remains a
thing apart, unique unto itself.
Most of us make life's journeys without understanding that the journeying is a
separate thing."
