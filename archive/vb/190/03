just tap a hole in the side, and thread the zerk into it?

Hopefully you won't be drilling any holes in ball joints, tie rod ends.
These parts should be forged and even if you get the holes drilled with a
carbide bit its not likely that you'll ever get them tapped for a
threaded xerk fitting. There are press in xerk fittings though.
