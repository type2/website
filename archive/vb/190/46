Subject: cardboard? headliner

So... last summer I got annoyed that the warped cardboard-y stuff over my
head was drooping down and touching my hair, so I pulled it out.  Along with
the insulation behind it.  At the time I figured it didn't do much of
anything.  Now that it's gotten cold out I've discovered that what it does
is keep the condensation on the inside of the roof from dripping on my
head - ick.

I'm wondering if anyone has replaced these with other materials and whether
it worked.  I was thinking of gluing some polar fleece up there... I don't
know if new panels are available but since I'm on a student loan I'm just
looking for a cheap solution for now.

Also, the wood in the rest of the roof (66 westy) is all moldy and gross.
Any suggestions on something else to replace it with that won't grow funky
black mold?

Thanks in advance,
Diana
