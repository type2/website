I will admit to knowing nothing about turbos. That
said, if you are really concerned with heat, stay away
from 87mm P & C's. I am sure there are some that will
disagree but tests have been done a little thought
will tell you it's a bad trade off. Those extra mm's
are made buy thinning the cylinders to accept a bigger
piston, thus making them prone to warpage as well as a
tendency to run hotter. Go to a machine in 88mm at the
very least and stay away from slip in kits. You will
be glad you spent the extra dough in the long run.
