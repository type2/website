Subject: re:staying warm / cab divider

not sure what green tape you are referring to-but try painters tape, it is
usually blue, kind of papery feel to it. designed to peel off easily.

I have found the curtains behind my front seat make a huge difference in the
drafy feeling in the bus. generally all that is in the back seats of my bus
are tools, or materials. so i keep all the heat up front.

on that note I would like to make a cab divider for the winter...is there a
template or tracing of one posted anywhere?
