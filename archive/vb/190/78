Subject: thanks, bus

For being a home away from home on any journey.
For working so hard I've taken it for granted.
For letting me be the mechanic and rewarding me for my efforts.

And thanks to everyone on the vintagebus list. I can only imagine how many
engines or even entire busses I might have destroyed if it were not for what
I've learned through the list.
