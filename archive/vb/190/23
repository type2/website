Subject: play in the steering

My 66 Bus has alot of play in the steering. When I'm cruising on I-5, I'm
struggling a tad to keep it in the lane. I don't know much about the front
axle & it's steering. Is it typical for the steering box and its components
to cause this action or is it more likely the sway bar, tie rod
stuff.......? 

Thanks for any knowledge given!
