Diana,

Funky black mold can be icky stuff. To eliminate, first remove and discard
all infected material. Second, spray all surfaces inside the bus with
hydrogen peroxide (drug store for 59 cents a pint. Wear some gloves. Let it
dry out and then install new interior. If you are cheap(and I guessyouare
since you are on a student loan) just spray down all the infected areas and
keep the old interior. Good luck,
Chris
