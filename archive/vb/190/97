Bryan,

I just came from FL, up to Seattle, and had a great trip along the way.

You should definitly check Big Bend National Park, in TX.  I had never been
off of the east coast, and watching the ground rise around me when I made my
way west was way cool.  After TX, I went up to Carlsbad Caverns NM, Grand
Canyon, AZ.  If you are making your way to Cali, then I would skip Grand
Canyon.  A good substitute is Yosemite National Park.  Same as the canyon,
but It's GREEN.

I wanted to make it to all the different canyons, and high stuff in Utah,
but my bus wasn't liking the Altitude.  Are you taking a bus?

Anyway, that is just a cursory synopsys... - K
