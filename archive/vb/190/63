Subject: Re: [VB] re:staying warm / cab divider

I made a cab divider out of heavy guage clear vinyl recently, in order 
to stay warm on a round trip Tucson to Detroit.  This worked very well 
and I stayed warm in a somewhat drafty '67 bus.  This bus has an inline 
booster fan installed under the splash fan.  I did need to advance the 
ignition timing a bit to help the engine run somewhat warm.  Its desert 
set up makes it run way too cold once the temps start to run below 
60*!   A no problem 4,300 mile bus trip!   Gary Gibson
