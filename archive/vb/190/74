Go get yourself a bottle of Meguair's Cleaner Wax.   It has worked great for 
me on the lightly oxidized paint and I also use it periodically on my camper 
window frames.  It's got a fine abrasive the will polish up lightly oxidized 
paint and will protect with the wax.

BTW you can find the stuff at any FLAPS.

Hope that helps,
