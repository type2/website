Subject: RE: [VB] VDO clock question

 One of my secrets? is to go to a wrecking yard and get the rectangle clock
from a early Mercedes (10 to 20 dollars), I don't remember which year but i
have a couple here. All you need to do is change the bezel and you have a 12
volt clock

ps. I think E and B rebuild them for 60 dollars and I just saw another guy
on one of the bus list I follow that does clocks and speedos for 30 to 60
dollars.

 I was curious if anyone has found an aftermarket clock that fits into a
 splittie's clock hole, I was trying to get mine working and I let the

North Hollywood Speedometer here in LA will rebuild and clean up the
clock, installing a quartz drive movement to replace the
electro-mechanical original guts. Charge is $120 complete, as of several
months ago. Look them up online search - google.com.
