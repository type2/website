My steering box has about 1mm to 1.5mm play on the shaft that the pitman arm
goes to.  Is there anything that can be done to this or should I just leave
it?
There is only one guy who can refurbishes the steering boxes properly in the
UK, but he is a retired engineer and only does a few now and again.  The
Split screen van club is raising money to have the tooling made up for the
parts to have them repaired properly but until then I can't get a
refurbished RHD box unfortunately.
I am aware that over adjusting the box can cause notchy steering and cause
the box to wear out more, just wondered if a small amount of play could be
taken out.  My box is very grimy, and doesn't look like it has been adjusted
for a long time.

Thanks
