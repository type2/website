Subject: Cleaning seats etc 

Decided yesterday to clean out the inside of my westy.  After shoveling the 
junk on the floor into a bag and sweeping out the detritus, I got out a 
bucket and scrub brush and some terry rags and the dilute simple green.   Got 
the dash all clean, even around the speedo.) I wanna swap the speedo over for 
a prettier one I have, That's on 'my list'.  Might end up waiting till the 
milage matches.  hmm.  Wiped up he coffee spills.  Sprayed simple green on 
the OG drivers seat (grey with white piping from a 62-64>  think I'' swap 
front seats .. put this in the truck (where it'll match) and put a different 
one in the westy- maybe use that leather cover and stuff some more padding 
in... hm.  Scrub scrub with the bristle brush.   Wipe of with the rag.  Went  
in the back and use it more dilute and scrubbed to get into the grain of the 
real vinyl leatherette in that lovely yellowy colour used in the mid 60s.   
Maybe I should recover it all in paisley corduroy.  I could make removable 
covers , so I could wash them.  Ya.   Turn to the seat behind the driver and 
soak and scrub.   After wiping the cabinets down and the wiping the seats off 
the water in the bucket is brown, so the bus must be cleaner, right?   Where 
the stuff soaked for longer it did get it cleaner.  Didn't get 100% of the 
stains off, but there is a definate difference.  And least it smells better.  
Need to get some rubbing compound and polish the paint inside, though. 

Found the tiny adjustable wrench and tightened the clutch cable a few turns.  
Ah... better.
