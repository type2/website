Subject: ADMIN: Friend Greetings e-cards are now filtered

All,

I have added the Friend Greetings e-cards to the mail filters on
type2.com.  This should prevent any more messages from them from
appearing on the lists.

If a Friend Greetings e-card does make it through to the list, report
it to vintagebus-owner(-at-)type2.com or type2-admin(-at-)type2.com .  DO NOT
click on the link in the message and DO NOT reply to the list!  Just
send it to the admins and the filters will be updated.

Please let myself, vintagebus-owner(-at-)type2.com , or type2-admin(-at-)type2.com
know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
One of the type2.com admins
