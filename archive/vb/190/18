Subject: RE: [VB] hooded sweatshirt wanted

Hooded sweatshirts and other German aircooled vehicle related items may be
found via Rex Eastman at [Rex Eastman" <vwrex(-at-)cs.com>]. 

I believe that Rex has altered his stock as to not infringe on popular Logos
and Corporate entity phases, trademarks, copyrights and property. Read between
those lines. Rex does not have nor will he carry items directly of that type.

Check at the provided email address to see which general public domain graphic
designs he carries.

If Rex does not have what you want-he may know of another source.
Take care and best to you.
