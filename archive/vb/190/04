Hi Steve,
Well that is interesting!

  All of our VW factory manuals for pre-1968s models show sealants used!
1963-67 VW shop manul for Buses (Section A-3, page 1) with the factory 
windshield seals with molded corners lists:
Description: D 10 & D 10/5 Genuine VW Window Sealant
Use: Sealing window glass when installing

Also shown used in our 1965 VW shop manual for Bugs, and K Ghias (A-15, page 
22, & A-63, page 20), and most of the earlier VW shop manuals we have shows 
this used.

Our Vanagon Official Factory Repair Manual (Section 64, page 3) has over two 
pages of info and four illustrations on proper beading of "Adhesive bead" AKA 
"Sealant bead" used from 1986 on.  Why call an adhesive a sealant?  Because 
the seal is glued to the body to prevent the seal from moving around and 
allowing dirt and water to make thier way under the seal.  

Additionally seals without sealant in bugs and K Ghias are absolutely 
insidious when they leak the water drips through the factory primer drip 
holes in the windshield frame.  This water never shows up visably to the 
driver, but drips down just in front of the door pillar and seeps into the 
heater tubes thusly rusting out the heater channels, watering the floor 
through the heater vents, and giving one that lovely water vapor all over the 
windshield when runing the defroster.

Once Eric moved up from Texas his 1963 KG and SC truck leaked.  Only sealant 
installed by a windshield shop dried out the KG and took several years to 
figure the home remidy of roofing tar for the rest of our VWs.  Roofing tar 
seals, will reseal when warmed by sunlight if you when you offroad it too 
much and best of all, tar repels rusting!  We have a 1952 sunroof split that 
was barned in 1964 and the original OG factory Bahama Brown (Hersey choclate 
bar brown!) is still perfect inside the fenders under the thin layer of tar 
that is now peeling away.
