Subject: From east to west , and back

Hello all,
I am starting to plan a trip for next summer to do a 2nd honeymoon. We want
to drive from Charlotte NC to SO Cal, and back. Anyone have ideas for routes
and things to see on the way??
Should I go low through the Desert or high through the Plains?
any ideas would be great.
Thanks- Bryan
