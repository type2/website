Subject: 63 Crewcab VIN plates and title wanted 

I am reposting again about the 63 crewcab that my friend got screw out of a 
title on. The crew has NO VIN plate or M-code plate. The numbers that are 
stamped into the metal in the engine compartment at gone do to rust.

If anyone has a VIN and M-code plate for a 63 Crewcab, please drop me a 
private note. With title would be great, but I can do without or a bill of 
sale.

I hate doing this sort of thing, but this is a last resort.

Thanks,
David
