Subject: Bus-venturer stranded near Clear Lake

Hey, All -
This bus-venturer looked me up on the AIRS list last week. She stopped by and 
we thought we had fixed her brake challenge, but now, I get this email and 
she is too far out for me to be able to rescue. Anyone out there that can 
help?  
Karolyn can be emailed at westybus71(-at-)hotmail.com    
Thanks, a ton, in advance -
Greg



Hey there, Greg!

Well, bad news.  We are stuck on the side of the road down here in 
Middletown, CA (just under Clear Lake) with a horribly bad caliper.  It 
burned up and now we're in a place that apparently has almost NO resources.  
Do you know anyone in these parts who would know a thing or two about VWs?  
I was trying to get towed to Santa Rosa, but AAA will only tow me 5 miles. 
:P

Thanks! :)
Karolyn
