Subject: Mercedes wheels on Type I Van

I just picked up a set of 14" 89 Mercedes allow wheels with a 112mm x  5
bolt pattern.
I want to buy adapters like EMPI or whatever is avaliable to install them
on my 66 Splittie.
I've seen lots of wheel conversions on early busses and was wondering if
adapters for the Mercedes wheels are available.
