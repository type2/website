Subject: re:grease fittings

I meant a grease fitting for the clutch pedal lever. 

was writ:
Hopefully you won't be drilling any holes in ball joints, tie rod ends.
These parts should be forged and even if you get the holes drilled with a
carbide bit its not likely that you'll ever get them tapped for a
threaded xerk fitting. There are press in xerk fittings though.
