Subject: RE: [VB] play in the steering

id check the tie rods and drag link first... wheel bearings, then link and
king pins... center pin, etc.
I know running bias plies can also make you think the vehicle is wandering a
bit more than say low profile radials...

My 66 Bus has alot of play in the steering. When I'm cruising on I-5, I'm
struggling a tad to keep it in the lane. I don't know much about the front
axle & it's steering. Is it typical for the steering box and its components
to cause this action or is it more likely the sway bar, tie rod
stuff.......?
