Clara writ:
"or write in large letter on the back of it "40hp at work, please just pass"
"

Someone used to sell these stickers and I cannot remember who...  Does
anyone know who still makes these?

I think a few others were "Too slow?  Too bad!" and "Never get behind an old
VW".

Those are a little tacky for me, but I like the 40HP idea and the previously
mentioned hazard triangle.


Thanks,
