Subject: contest- picking winner definitely difficult!

The proper and correct Subject to be used according to
the rules was < re:Contest 5Word >

By default of the goofy list server the correct
Subject became < [VB] re:Contest 5Word >
Will someone please explain what that flippin [VB] is
anyhow?

Including the "correct" one there were 37 variations
used.

There were 193-200 entries.

There were 76 participants.

You should see what crap that I've gone through to
"Normalize" the data. Pfffft!

It's past midnight Arizona time and I have yet to find
ANYONE who followed the rules to a T. Trying to be
fair to those who made decent attempts to do so I am
still looking at the short list.

Thanks to all who participated. Apparently we all had
a lot of fun. Y'all are nuts! =)
Results for sure Monday Night.
