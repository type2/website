Hi Edward...anybody who tells you "this is the way it is" when talking
about a non-Westy camper is full of it. They were all made to the whim of
the day. Some Sundials had notches every 12 inches or so. My EZ Camper (it
has a tag, so I know that's what it is) has nothes every 6 inches or so,
but I've seen other EZ's that are different.

The people that tell you that kind of thing are also likely to tell you
that you don't have a "real" camper because it's not a Westfalia. That's
malarkey as well. The off-brand campers were sold at dealerships just like
Westfalias were.

The only thing you have to go on is the scratched off tag with the serial
number. It sounds like the tag off of an EZ Camper. EZs are the only ones
I've seen that have serial numbers like that. Although...like I said above,
that is not the law, just my personal observation. The problem I have with
my own theory is that my EZ's serial number is higher than yours, but was
built in 1965. Is there any possibility that the serial number had the
first digit scratched off too?
