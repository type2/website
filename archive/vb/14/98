Subject: Hello!

I've been a spectator of the list for a while now and thought I might
introduce myself finally.  My name is Duffy and own a 1960 Double Cab, a
1960 Beetle (Creamsicle) and a 2002 Jetta TDI.  I am currently the president
of a local VW club called Club VeeDub here in Calgary, Alberta.  You can
check out our site at www.clubveedub.com

I love the list!
