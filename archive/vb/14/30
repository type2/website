I was looking at Walter Miller's site the other day at www.autolit.com and
noticed it had some bus literature advertised bot 50's and 60s variety.
Camper stuff ( one EZ camper reference ) press kit for '60s crew cab, etc.
Prices... you judge for yourself.

I haven't dealt with this organization before, but have seen continued ads
over the years so finally got around to checking this out.

Thought it might be of interest to somebody..... ( and disclaimer: I have no
connections at all with the Walter Miller organization!!))
