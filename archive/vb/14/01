Subject: aircooled resque t-shirts...

Hi list,

     I replied to the gentleman who is taking orders for the air cooled 
resque squad t-shirts (or something to that effect),  and I would like him 
to e-mail me w/ the procedure for ordering.  I would like a meduim short 
sleeve shirt.

Thanks a million,
Matt in Pa
