Subject: RE truck drivers

I have been a truck driver for more than 30 years ( yeah, I'm gettin' old ).
I can speak for lots of us when I say " It ain't the bus that pisses us off,
its the driver" If you get out there and exercise your right to slow down a
loaded truck at the beginning of a long hill, he's gonna crowd you.
Use your mirrors, know what's happening behind as well as in front of you.
Learn how to flash your lights to let him know when he can pull back in
ahead of you. That's not only a safety item ( yes it's legal, not like a 'do
pass' signal ) it's also a courtesy.
Just remember, it works both ways.
