Old '60s and 70's travel decals really are period looking, full of color,
and look right at home on a VW bus. According to a friend who was a VW
mechanic during that period; either a bus had none or it was plastered with
them.

I have collected 22 which are on my bus right now; tastefully arranged. I
can still see out the back window with the right rear window covered with
most of them. Maybe 2-3 more but no more room after that.... The travel
decals were chosen based on where I had been, or places the bus had been in
the past, and a combination of both.

A decal collector would probably freak out that I actually used them. But
they are on a vehicle.... where they should be anyway.
