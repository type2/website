memoriabilia.

So Woody, are they <the Garcia buses> really signed by
Jerry?

Ellis thinks NOT! Jerome J. "Jerry" Garcia died August
9, 1995. The buses were displayed around North America
during 1997 as part of the *Private Issue by Discover*
promo tour to get folks to sign up for and use the
Discover Cards. The cards themselves reflected an
example of a given celebrity's art work. Garcia was
only one of the art-teests. The card holder was given
the artistic card, a promo Tshirt and a chance to win
a prize. For a separate love donation we were given
the oppty to have our photo taken in front of the bus
as it sat on the NewMexico State fairgrounds during
the annual Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta. The members of
the Arizona Bus Club attended Buses and Balloons with
weird magnetic blue "tear" on their buses to show
sympathy/pathos/bad judgement relating to Jerry's
Death and the then new VW image of the crying bus.
<always thought that was weird>.
I still have the Discover card <never used>, the
Tshirt is literally in the drier as I write. Everytime
the card was used the card holder generated another
entry into the give-away contest. I recall that the
winner of the promotion had the choice between either
bus or something non-Volkswagen.
All we got was the photo with the Aura of white yellow
and green light emitting from my upper chakras as I
stood with my wife in front of the '59 Jerry bus.
I remember that the OG paint job was tan and chocolate
brown with tan interior. Discover only painted the
exterior with TONS of clear coat on top of the art.

I'd *love* to own the bus and would keep it just as it
is. Past that point I could care less if it was a
Deady bus or not. I have no hang ups pro or con re:
Jerry and the G'Dead. It seemed like a nice bus.
