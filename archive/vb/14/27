That is true but the top speed of the bus is
approximately the same or near what the speed limit is
for trucks in most states.  

It is much harder to get and expensive to get a
driver's license in Germany, as you state.  I really
think that there should be a better screening process
here as well.  In Chicago I notice that nobody uses a
turn signal or stops for stop signs.  There needs to
be more education and a way to make bad drivers take
public transportation.  I have even seen cars blow red
lights in front of Chicago Police and nothing happens.
 Perhaps there was a more important call at Dunkin
Doughnuts.  :-)
