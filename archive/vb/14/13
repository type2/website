Subject: My mail is not working!!!

Of course Friday evening my email went out of service.  I can send just fine
but trying to down now over 400 messages is painstaking.  I get about 8 done
and my ISP resets.  Something is seriously wrong and it's affecting the
whole town. :-(

So, I'm just barely able to read posts at the rate of about 1 every 5
minutes via the web interface.  If anyone needs to get in touch with me, I
do have webmail at mailto:buskatiers(-at-)kickassmail.com until this is all
overwith.  Even my backup account at the ISP is not working.  Major
bandwidth issues..
