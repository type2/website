Subject: Contest Winners and Non Winners?

Hi Real Bus People   It has come to my attention that
Jim Ellis is related to all the contest winners.Each
one is somehow related back to Mr Ellis.DNA samples
are now being collected by various underhand means and
results will be posted to the list.All that entered
the "Contest" are warned to hold onto their entries
for review by the court approved panel.The prizes will
be collected and  handed out to the real... non DNA
related winners if we can find any!                   
                 In the way of bus news..I have been
sanding away on the nose of my bus trying to make it
look a bit better.The PO hit something and did a bad
job fixing it.Not that I am doing any better just
trying to hide the cracks that show thru the "Paint" 
This baby wont win any shows and with luck it might
stay out of the "Hall of Shame" on Thoms Vintage Bus
site...if it has not already been entered by a sneaky
cameraman.  Well back to the brandy and beer....ahh
that explains alot....Later, Mark
