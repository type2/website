I have run into what I have heard referred to as a "TRUCK STORM" a few times..
I-81 in VA. is the worst I have felt,, as I wasn't able to drive as fast as the
trucks,, who insisted on getting right on my rear bumper before changing
lanes,,  I noticed this was way worse at night ,,, 

I took some reflector red tape and stuck it to 3 fridge magnet strips,, then I
stick it on the rear hatch in the shape of a farm vehicle sign,, SLOW MOVING ,, 

this has dramatically increased the space that the big trucks leave when they
change lanes to get around me!

:-)  I used this sign set up during a rain storm once,, and a Bus following me
commented that that was about the only thing that was visible through the fog
and downpour

just my 1.6 cents canadian eh!
