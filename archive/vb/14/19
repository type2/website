Well, lessee...

http://www.gaymart.com/travel/us/fl/daytonab.html
(scroll down to find Barndoor listing under Bar and
Dance clubs...if you go I don't want to know about it)

http://www.thevermontshop.com/caledonia_cty/stjohnsbury.html
(scroll down to the B section to find the Barndoor
Drive-in Restaurant)

http://www.doubledoorinn.com/1.html (I wouldn't mind
taking in some of the entertainment offered here)

http://www.doubledoor.com/ (Think I'll pass on the
entertainment here)

Goose eggs on Sunroof and Slammed Panel, however...

(look under Bars/Clubs for Westfalia)

That's all the time I have for now, besides, it's not Friday!
