Many states have minimum speeds on freeways, usually set about 25MPH below the maximum.  I cruise at 58MPH on I-5 in the 70MPH 
zone and don't have much of a problem.  Trucks supposedly have a maximum speed limit of 55 in California, but they cruise at about 
62-65 normally.  Never have much of a problem or cause a backup.

It's currently popular to rag on the educational system but, at least in California, Driver's Education is a required part of the curriculum.

Truckers usually don't deign to speak with lowly "4-wheelers" on the CB.  They're usually too busy brushing up on their 4-letter 
vocabulary.
