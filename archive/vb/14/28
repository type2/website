Hi Woody,

Thanks for the invite to a DBG event, actually it's
the second one today.  The reason I commented about
the weak VW bus scene is only because I never see any
on the road.  I probably see 2-3 pre-67 buses over the
span of a year here in the city.  I spotted a
butt-load of bays last week for some reason, mostly in
Lincoln Park.

Maybe if I visited your  club I would see more. :-)

Paul
