Subject: 3 is not bad....

Hey Real Bus People    Took the short drive to
Downtown SLO and got to look at 3 cool ones for my
troubles.A Panel..a 21 Deluxe with sunroof..and a 67
Dormobile.Slow day I guess.I talked with the owner(25
years old?) of the 67 camper and told him about the
list.He is looking for a drivers door.He has one
on(haha) but his is rusted out on the bottom...whats
the big deal they all are.Well mine is.His camper is
orange/yellow in color and looks good to me.He has had
it a bit more than a year and already been to Alaska
and many other places.Said he had to change out the
engine on the road to Alaska...sounds like fun.Maybe
he will show up on list and give us the real info on
his Dormobile.First one I have ever seen up
close...Kind of cool.
