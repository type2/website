Dang, I had forgotten all about this.  At first I thought this was some kind
of sick joke but regretfully, I do believe you are right.  Wasn't Mike the
guy that wrote those posts that were always narrow columned (like they were
written on a Commodore 64) and full of really short sentences?  He just kind
of appeared on the list and then all of a sudden vanished.  I'd sure like to
know more about Mike because it seemed like he really knew his stuff about
VWs.  I still say we need a memorial site for our dearly departed listees
including Mike West, Scott Yuppa, Josh Rodgers, and that one fella whose bus
was plowed into by a drunk killing everyone in the family except him (who
barely survived himself.)  I've always wanted to put up a site like that but
didn't really have the resources to do one good and proper.  Just how would
one go about doing a site like this?
