Subject: tale of 2 Buses

   There here, after weeks of waiting 2 new buses appeared at my home on
Sunday while I was at Pomona, a 1960 15 window Deluxe and a ???? 21 window
Deluxe. They were supposed to be delivered on Friday morning before I left
on my weekend VW show adventure, but that wasn't going to happen, I waited
till 1 pm for a phone call, but none so off I went. It was a very fun
weekend and the excitment kept building as I would recieve phone calls as to
the whereabouts of these buses. Then the call came, THERE HERE, 9 am Sunday
moring. I wnted to pack up and leave Pomona to get home to check them out,
but decided what's another few hours after waiting since JUNE to get them.
The 1960 15 window is MINE, to go in my collection of 1060's era buses, 60
DD ( to be converted to a 58 look), 1960 DC (100% rust free) Whored Viper
Red look (who needs stock), and my 1960 Westy (will be stock). All I need is
a 60 single cab and a high roof to complete the colection

ps, the 21 window isn't mine, I don't like the extra windows and the rag top
