I disagree with you to some extant. Though I do feel it is proper to
move to the right lane when driving slower. But even in the right lane,
a speed that is drastically lower than the overall flow pattern can be a
hazard. I doubt that five miles under the speed limit would likely be a
hazardous situation but it could be if the traffic on that road is
speeding. Of course, this would be a situation where the speed limit
should be changed, but thats not likely to happen. More likely that the
police will set up radar there and present a road hazard themselves.

In Germany, they start teaching children the rules of the road in
Kindergarden. They get additional "drivers ed" every year throughout.
Here in the states, drivers ed has been cut in many states do to lack of
funds. It's no wonder that many can't drive or even think.

If I had to make a long haul on a highway where I knew the traffic
pattern was fast and there were many trucks, I might buy or borrow a CB
radio and let the truckers on the route know. I think in such a case you
might find them very helpful.

In fact, I think I will probably do just that. . . install a CB in my
bus.
