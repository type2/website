Subject: Re: [VB] Battery Problem?

Aw crap...I wish someone would have posted that event.
 I found out about it this morning at a restaurant
near Lone Rock, WI when a guy was admiring my 66
Deluxe Beetle and told me about the wonderful show
that he had seen in Madison (or was it Middleton).  I
was a half hour west of there and never knew about it.
 

I have the same beetle and have changed the voltage
regualtor a couple of times.  Be sure to check the
generator output as well.  If that doesnt work than I
guess you have a short or bad ground but my guess is
to go with the regulator.
