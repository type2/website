(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)(-at-)  Mike West was before my time here on the
list....How long as it been now for me? one week.. two
weeks..one month..two? Time loses all meaning when
your unemployed.I did a search in the archives for
Mike West and found his postings.I looked at some of
them and I look forward to reading more.I know nothing
about VW's but his writing seemed to me to be very
informative along the lines of the well known Jim
Ellis and George Lyle with others on this list (I am
new remember) Well worth the reading...I think NQ has
a good idea.Needs to be a place for those that have
cruised on up the slow lane ahead of us.As Mike West
wrote...Hey,Whould I lie to you guys?

Mark and his under-repair...by me...poor thing..67 Deluxe walk thru 13 window Ol'No Name in San Luis Obispo,Calif...7 miles to the ocean! Sea-Ya (:}
