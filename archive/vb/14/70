Hey Ed
First, congratulations on your new bus...

Weather or not it is a Sundial, no one could tell
unless it was actually seen by someone familiar with
Sundials and other camper conversions. Keep in mind
that all of the features that people tell you are
associated with Sundials are not always true on all
Sundials. If you saw my Sundial you would see that
mine breaks most of the common misconceptions about
Sundials. 
Get your camper to some of the VW shows and have
people in the know look at it and then maybe you will
find the correct manufacture of yours.

way to Burning Man this week...
