Ten percent of other motorist have the mentality of sizzling bacon.
Your adventure to Chicago, leaves me with mental hives, as I
only have a 5 hour drive south on interstate 5 & my 60 double
cab will only do 52mph, my choice.
Think I may change the route to smaller less traveled roads where 
possible.
