I get within 1 bus length or when I stop getting buffeted by the wind. As
far as the man goes and seeing whats in front the trucker keeps me informed
via the CB.
When VW Howard and I went to Buses and Ballons 2 years ago, I got behind a
Swift truck for at least 100 miles.

ps SWIFT trucks are goverened at 63 mph!

Ronnie,

Just how close does one have to get to properly be pulled in by the draft?
And
when drafting, how do you keep an eye out for the CHP?

(in context of everything, that question as written, is what I meant.   Not
trying to make sophomoric jokes about drafting and hugging A#s)

Thanks,

Scott
