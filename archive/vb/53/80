Hm, In the last ten years there has been a lot more repro parts available for 
splitties.  The quality of the repro bits has gotten better, and sometimes 
cheaper.  Why?  Cause a lot of people are willing to spend some cash on these 
buses.  Makes it easier for me to keep the beasties going.  I don't think we 
can pray at the sacred church of the VW bus and expect some  hippy 
free/barter community.   The places that make and sell parts are business, 
many of them run but people who love old buses, but gotta pay the bills you 
know.

If you mean people selling buses for high prices, well, you don't need that 
$30K bus anyway.
Just met a guy last month with a newly aquired really nice hardtop 66 deluxe- 
green/white, slight rocker rot, original interior including middle seat all 
mesh platinum, nice headliner, very straight, had all the shiny trinkets 
including trim rings.  The slightly tatty original bus, paint not shiny 
anymore, but could probably be polished up. Ran fine.  He had been given the 
bus, the week before.
 They are out there.  You can still give your buses away to your friends.   
It can become a movement.  The anti capitalist give your bus away movement...
