Subject: Re: [VB] drafty front floor  :(

One of the *first* things done was sealing the windsheilds.   I figured 7 
years later  I might as well put a band aid on the gash. That hole has not 
been doing the  60-61 style floor mat any good, and this floormat is not easy 
to find.  We don't all have perfectly straight shiny rust free restored 
buses.  So kick a little slack to those trying to keep the drafts down so 
it's more comfy to drive a 40 year old bus around. 

ps the drafts have changed now that one is covered.  Sigh, I guess I should 
cover the hole in the other side and redo the tops of the front doors- I have 
NOS seals for the one side sigla glass hooray.   I had replaced the grey 
seals around the doors with good used in the summer, and also welded the 
thing the check rod in the forward cargo door slots down into, which helped a 
bunch of the drafts.  It's the functional maintenance, okay.  

ANyone know where to find Beige Grey in a rattle can?  Ya

ps  It's nice to be back on the list and be reminded that other people have 
old buses.
