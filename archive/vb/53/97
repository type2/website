  i had a set about a moth ago , i gave them to a freind, i would have givien 
them to you also ,as this vw thing is not about money to me, it about the 
thrill i get when when i drive my truck, i hope this doesn't sound to corny 
or hokey but it's just the way i feel. i know the gent from n.texas was only 
kidding, but if he would just rember the smile he had on his face when they 
were driving the 1949 heb around the texas motorplex ,hopefully he would put 
all his time and effort into that "one"vehicle and not spread his time and 
money too thin,it's not my right to tell you how to spend either ,i'm just 
saying what works for me, oh yea ,try www.wayoutsalvage.com in kingston ak. 
derect is a straight shooter ,if he can't help you he usually sugest where 
you might find the part,  as has been said many times on this list before 
"just my 2 cents worth", don please think about it though, , paul smith

 Okay, Okay,
 
 I know I am asking for the moon and sun served up to me on a silver platter 
 here, but . . .
 
 Does anyone have a set of corner windows (glass and surrounding 
 metal/structure) for a 23 window that they would be willing to sell?
 
 Ever hopeful and niaeve . . .

 Sure! I'll take $5,000 each for them or $10,000 total. Seriously, you may 
 have a problem finding those. I had a set of those little upper windows 
 missing, and it took me 2 bug-ins to find a replacement set. There's a junk 
 yard in California (LaVerre's)
 that I've had good luck with, I don't know about the curved 23-window 
 windows, however.
