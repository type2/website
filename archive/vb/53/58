Well tomorrow I am on the hunt at garage sales for my
set of chains. I do plan on bringing a shovel and also
hooking a tow strap to the beam of the bus before hand
so that I don't have to lie in the mud just in case.
Anyone else have any suggestions as to other stuff I
might need, I do have a list of my own, but I am sure
there is some stuff I may have overlooked. By the way,
is there any way to get a copy of that video??
 Mike
