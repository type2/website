This may be a dumb question =96 but I can=92t find a manual washer pump =
(the
rubber part) for my 65 Sundial in any of the parts lists.  Any =
suggestions
where to purchase?

Also =96 my wipers run R-E-A-L  s-l-o-w   =96 I believe the PO (took me =
a while
to figure out that acronym!) didn=92t convert the wiper motor to 12v =
when he
converted it.  What is the recommendation?  Should I put a =
=93reducer=94 on it
and run the existing wiper motor =96 and will it help the speed?  Or is =
there
another option?  How difficult is this?
=20
Brings up another point =96 my hazards don=92t blink =96 the big red =
light left of
the steering column comes on steady.  Is this a 6v-12v related problem? =
 Any
thoughts?

Thanks =96=20
