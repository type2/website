cab. you tend to see these more on early 60's westy's and by the time they =
got to so 42's they petered out

On the 64 Westy I just sold there were 8.  One on top of each of the 6 =
pop-outs and one for the top AND the bottom of the rear hatch window.  =
This Westy also had a Ninth rod that hung between the cab and the rear =
passenger area.
