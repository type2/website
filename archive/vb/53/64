Subject: Free Appraisals--

For many years I have been doing Free VW Appraisals-- But, Please-- I cannot
do this Via E-Mail or Snail mail--I Must be able to see the VW In Person--
If you think you will be at a VW Show and I will be there, then I can help
you--or if you are in "The Shores of Phoenix"
To keep the integrity of my appraisals --I must maintain a high
standard--And "In Person" is the only way--Hopefully all of you understand--
Many Thanks--TWWM, uj
