Subject: Re: [VB] drafty front floor  :(

But some of us that *do* have shiny, reasonably straight, rust-free
restored buses have them because we spent the time to replace the
floor pans and rockers and whatnot.

The passenger side floor section took me between 2 and 2.5 hours to replace
on the '60.

Also - do you have the pedal pan on your bus?  It makes a *huge* difference
in draft reduction!

Although I haven't done it on this bus yet, I found that replacing the
factory heater tube wrap with foam pipe insulation, as well as insulating
the curved sections fore and aft that are not normally insulated, helped
considerably with heat.
