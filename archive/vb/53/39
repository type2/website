Subject: Looking 4 bmp of jpg?

Does anyone have a bmp or jpg of the following?:  Buses go around a circle
and on the inside the VW is made of bones.  I want to get this for personal
use.  Not to be put on anything For Sale.  I bought a T-Shirt with it on it
and the shirt ended up fitting my son.  I just want to make a small clock
for my Desk and use it for a background.

Dave
