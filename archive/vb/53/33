Hi Joel,
Good point for the main and pilot jetting!  Except one has to go bigger and 
bigger with the air correction jet to get the same result.  Best to figure 
out the pilot jetting first with a main jet a size smaller than what is 
called for.  Then work on the main jet for low end HP with no stumble, and 
this can be complicated by the accellerator nozzle system being off so needs 
to be adjusted or easily adjustable so easily screwed up as in the 34PICT-3 
carb accellerator nozzle.  Then finally the air correction for the higher RPM.

<< Probably the answer is trial and error, I don't think you can count on the 
jet sizes that work in someone else's engine to work the same with yours. I 
would try a 60 pilot first, if that still runs good then try the 55. But 
check the stroke of your fuel pump first if you haven't, I think too high 
fuel pressure can make the engine run rich despite correct jetting.>>

Again correct.  The jet sizes VW stated always could be off to even the new 
VW engine off the facotry line, but should be close.  So jetting 
experimentation is always best to make sure.

 To Al,
The 120 air correction sounds like it is going to be way too small and run 
the engine too rich in the higher RPMs, but at least that is way better than 
running way too lean for a short time till you find or make a proper sized 
jet.
