Subject: RE: 15 % Off Everything Through December 31 at Bus Boys

There is a reason why I can only offer listmembers 15% off during one
particular day, and 5% off the rest of the time. At my prices, if I ran 15%
off all month it would put me out of business, because my everyday prices
are so heavily discounted already. Not that I'm disparaging Bus Boys - in
fact I could vouch for them; I was a customer of theirs once. They have
strengths in areas that I don't (as do other vendors on the list; there are
several good ones). But every company has its focus. Mine is deep-discount
pricing.
