We went going to do this for awhile, but someone had brought it up in the

I will pass this info along to Hubby!

> Yes and no.YOu will suffer severe power loss using this trans after you
take it apart ste it up properly and install the reduction boxes.Best to get
a rebuilt bus center section with a 4.12 R&P from a reputable rebuilder and
go with that.Any other questions just ask.
