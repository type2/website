Amen.  I watched a guy back a flatbed up to a rare Binz-Westy doubledoor highroof, and inside of 5 minutes this strapping chick with BERTHA emblazoned on the 
back of her muscle shirt had hopped out and *pushed* the bus up on the flatbed.  Apparently with the e-brake still on.

She caught me looking at her and called out "If they axles' froze, Ah jest picks em up!"

Cackling wildly, she leapt into the cab and the flatbed roared off.

Be careful, man.
