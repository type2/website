Subject: Corner Windows for 23 Window

Okay, Okay,

I know I am asking for the moon and sun served up to me on a silver platter 
here, but . . .

Does anyone have a set of corner windows (glass and surrounding 
metal/structure) for a 23 window that they would be willing to sell?

Ever hopeful and niaeve . . .
