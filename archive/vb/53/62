Vintage price lists for just about anything....
Some that I loked at over the past year seem to be pretty close to what
the market is paying...be sure and check out the price for a cherry 1967
21 window deluxe.  $$$$$$$$$$ >>

Anybody out there know how to work the 1967 vs. 2001 dollars? Just as 
a point of reference to make a bit more sense out of the prices. 
Also, approx. how many '67 21 window deluxe's were there, even in '67?
Rarity affects price...I know of the sale of an "unrestorable" British pick
up truck, that was purchased for the original title. It was the "yard truck"
for the factory that occasionally went on the road...A factory "one-off"
and hence, valuable...
