 don't know N.A.D.A. is like kelley blue book and is what insurance
 companies, dealers set the selling and insured values of our buses at.
 According to NADA my 15 window is worth 6100 low and 14100 finished, my DC
 4525 low and 11950 high, my DD panel 4300 low and 11150 high and my westy >>

ya- WA state changed the registration laws and now I pay more, and it has 
something to do with the assessed value- when I bought my basket case 59 
westy a year ago, the lady at the counter pulled out a book and looked up the 
value.  I dont think they distinguished hardtop deluxes from sunroof deluxes 
though, at least in the book I saw.
