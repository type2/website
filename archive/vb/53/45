If I was a worrier, I'd worry a lot more about some deranged bus nut
(they don't really exist do they?) stealing my bus for parts than a
proper car thief stealing it for profit. There are a lot of $20k+ cars
parked out there on the city street that would attract a lot less
attention than a noisy, unmistakable, uncommon, often tempermental,
vintage bus?
I doubt any self respecting car thief has the time or patience to
figure out the little maneuver required to get the ratwagen into
third...

(Leaving my bus for two weeks at a remote NPS trailhead, again, you
bet I am pulling a lot of wires and parts before I walk away. You
would have to be an experienced bus nut to put it back together and
drive out of there...)

But if buses were worthless, you'd would have less
thefts, and fake thefts.
