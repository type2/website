 Okay, Okay,
 
 I know I am asking for the moon and sun served up to me on a silver platter 
 here, but . . .
 
 Does anyone have a set of corner windows (glass and surrounding 
 metal/structure) for a 23 window that they would be willing to sell?
 
 Ever hopeful and niaeve . . .

Sure! I'll take $5,000 each for them or $10,000 total. Seriously, you may 
have a problem finding those. I had a set of those little upper windows 
missing, and it took me 2 bug-ins to find a replacement set. There's a junk 
yard in California (LaVerre's)
that I've had good luck with, I don't know about the curved 23-window 
windows, however.
