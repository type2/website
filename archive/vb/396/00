George makes a good point.  Those toothed belts are not always best and I
have seen many more of those fail than the good 'ol standard.  I must admit
though that I try to find 9.5x900 as they spin the fan a little faster at
the lower rpms.  The 356 pulley is good too, but is a little overkill.  If
my memory is as good as I think, the type 3 pulley can be used too.

I think the R&D shows that the fan stops pushing more air through at about
4000 rpm.  If you are always above that, it doesn't matter which pulley you
run.
