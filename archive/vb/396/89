Subject: Bought a Sunroof Bus help(questions) needed

Bought the Sunroof Standard Walk Thru and have some sunroof questions:

1. Anyone sell after market parts other than Wolfsburg West?

2. Take a look at the pics in the link. Am I missing anything other than the
rear tension bar? Know I have some bent and one broke metal that goes between
the bow and the aluminum bow.

3. Anyone have the rear tension bar off that could measure the length, width
and thickness of it? Seems it would be easy to reproduce.

3. Any pics of one from the top, and from the inside installed. Done a search
on Samba and type2 list.
