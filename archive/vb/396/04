I thought it had more to do with the outside restrictions, such as the
venturi, the gas tank, and the small vents.  Didn't Gene Berg do a bunch of
testing on this too?  I seem to remember that he was surprised that
something as small as opening a vent wing on a bay window bus totally threw
off his testing.
