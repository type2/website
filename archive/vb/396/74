Subject: Re: Aridzona dd panel

That's a nice dd panel. One thing I've wondered is how hot it must be  
to drive a panel in Arizona, but probably not as bad as in the South.  
I can imagine in Texas it is a sweaty endeavor. Definitely needs  
safaris.

Speaking of which, Izzy says my Safaris should be here in a couple of  
weeks. My six month wait (no exaggeration) is nearing an end. I sure  
hope they are worth it! ;-)
