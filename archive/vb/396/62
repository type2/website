Anyone  know of what kind of metal is used to create the "bend" in the 
bendable  portion of the hirschmann antennas? 


Hi JD,
More than likely just a piece of brass lathed down in the center.
Here is one center mounted as it came from the dealership with under dash  
Blaupunkt Derby radio in our SO-34.

  The other antenna that easily works with safaris is one of the  dual base 
type also mounted in the center.  This tends to help  keep the front emblem in 
place against thieves if you mount one of the bases  inside the emblem.
