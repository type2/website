http://www.kuratrading.com/PDF/WaterInj.pdf   I have
been using water injection for over two years on my 80
Westy, it helps to keep the head temp's low enough to
run at highway speeds (60-65) I use a 2.5 gallon water
tank with a fish tank aerator as a filter, have a 12V
cut off valve between the tank and the intake
manifold, power on valve open/power off valve
closed,without this the water would siphon into the
engine. I have a #22 needle going into the vacuum for
the distributor as close as I can get it to the inlet.
At idle there is no water injected, when the throttle
is opened the flow starts with the vacuum, the volume
is controlled by the size of the needle. I have not
advanced the timing but I might try it, to see what
happens with the temp. Phil
