First... you might try a new battery..   Check with a dwell meter,, it will 
tell you if your points are opening,, and closing,, just because you 
installed a new set doesn't mean they are working electrically.... the dwell 
meter will tell you for sure.
you can use a test light instead of a dwell meter... if the points are 
opening and closing,, the light will flash on and off
connect the light to a ground and to the points wire that connects to the 
coil.
when your certain the points open and close,, you can test for spark at the 
main high tension wire held close to ground when the engine is turned over.

second,, sorry I can't help much more.. but I need to comment on the horn 
thing.

For the life of me I can't figure out HOW the HORN circuit can operate by 
hotwiring the ignition coil!
This has happened to me before...
The horn already has power,, and needs a ground to complete the circuit! ... 
putting power to the coil straight from the battery can't possibly cause the 
horn to operate!..... but it does!

sorry,, I know you want to  make your engine run.. not fix the horn 
circuit...
