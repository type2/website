Subject: RE: [VB] Removing a dist pinion drive

I've used snap ring pliers, kind of a pain but worked.  I use a magnetic wand
to get the washers out if necessary, two are the minimum but you can shim
higher.  To re-install the washers I use tubing to line up with the hole, a
dab of lith grease as an adhesive to hold the washers in place and slide them
down the tube. I use the tube to center the washers, like warvling a hole out
with a drill bit.  I then use a long thin screwdriver to press them down so
they stick.  THEN I remove the tube.
