Hi Dave,

I've been very slow in building a resource that would answer your  
questions, as I need to eventually do this same thing. I have been  
working on a page containing commonly found info, but hopefully in one  
place it can be useful.

http://www.dualport.com/21window/sunroof.html

I believe I have a link on that page to the repro tension bar someone  
is selling.

I've been collecting detail shots of pieces and assemblies at various  
shows. The "kits" all seem to be the same to me. There are some parts  
that are NLA such as the wood blocks.

Conrad
