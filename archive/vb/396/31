Hi P&C,

Sorry, I didn't take pics originally, but I did snap a quick photo this morning:

The resistor is on the far left with the spade connectors, modified
bulb is on the right.  The ones in the bus have the shrink tubing cut
out around the body of the resistor, that way someone down the line
can read the values and maybe it helps dissipate heat a little better.

I haven't actually seen what the bulbs are like in a bay window, but
if they are of the type with a flat glass base, maybe you can insert
the LED leads directly into the bulb holder?  You would still need a
current limiting resistor, of course.
