Actually, now that I think about it, the alternator lined up perfectly with 
the pulley when I used the bus generator backing plate.  What did not line 
up was the base of the alternator with the alternator stand.  The alternator 
butted up against the stand and didn't seat on it.  So I might try a different
alternator stand.  We'll have to see.
