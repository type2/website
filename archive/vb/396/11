Do you have you a source for these  LEDs.  We are working on replacement LEDs 
for the ceiling light,  soon.    P & C  <<



Hi P&C,
Just this week got our package from:
 _WWW.Superbrightleds.com_ (http://www.Superbrightleds.com) 
 
 Today tried the BA7s colored bulbs for the dash indicator (idiot  lights), 
but they will not work!  With an LED you can only apply  positive voltage one 
way to get them to work.  The other way and they do  not go bad, they just will 
not work wired that way.  The indicator bulbs in  a VW have positive voltage 
applied to the outer cylinder of the bulb, and  the negative to the tip.  
Going to see if with Dremel, epoxy, and a  soldering iron if these bulbs can be 
rewired
  On the other hand the white LED bulbs (if wired the same in the  bulb 
casing as the colored ones) for illuminating the speedo, clock,  fuel gauge will 
work, because the VW wiring applies the positive voltage to the  tip of the 
bulb.  Sigh....
 
  As for interior ceiling bulbs.  Get the 39 mm long festoon  bulbs with 6 
LEDs, from them.  Part number 3910-x6.
  We got the slightly shorter 36 mm ones with only 4 LEDs, by mistake  of 
measuring one bulb that turned out to be shorter than the rest.  Part  number 
3610-x4.  They just work after tugging the  ground loop in the bulb holders 
slightly closer to the positive  terminal.  Not as bright as the stock 5 Watt 
incandescent bulbs, and the  light is a white with a slightly blueish tone.  Uses 
only .384  Watts.  So can run the interior lights 13 times as long with these  
LEDs.  For some reason the 4, 6, and 9 LED bulbs have the same Wattage  rating.
  The even brighter nine LED 3022-B9 probably would work,  but not without 
machining up an adapter piece due to this bulb being only 30.7  mm long.
 
  There are a lot more bulbs to look at on this website,  and other suppliers 
of LED bulbs.  If anyone sees something that might  work well it would be 
great to hear about it.  Make sure to read this info  about LED bulbs for 
automobiles though:
