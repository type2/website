Subject: Saw a 67 hardtop deluxe.....

on a 4 car trailer heading north last Thursday.

Talked to the driver of the truck at a fuel stop in Roseburg, Oregon.   He said he picked it up in Las Vegas
and was taking it to Vancouver, Canada.

Good looking bus. 13 window. White top. Wrong blue bottom. No plates. Full roof rack.

Sound familiar to anyone?
