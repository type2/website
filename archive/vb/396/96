> Can someone help me? The light that goes to the clock stays on all the time, which makes the clock not work. When I pull the light switch out to turn on the head lights , the light goes off. It should be the other way around. I put a different switch in, but it does the same thing. thanks,Bob

There is 3 connections to the clock...
the lamp comes from the headlight switch terminal 58B only on when switch is 
pulled out
the clock gets power from terminal 30 which is Always power from the battery
plus the ground ... make sure there is a good ground. 

Make sure with a test lamp that term 58b is off and on with the headlights 

make sure with a test lamp that term 30 is always live.. 

hope that helps
