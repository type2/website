The garden variety "20 for $1" LEDs seem to have a high enough inverse
voltage rating that this is true, at least for voltages you'd find
around a car.  Some of the newer high-brightness ones have pretty low
inverse voltage ratings and might not like being connected backwards
in a 12 V circuit.

The key is probably short exposure time - if you put in an LED lamp
that can go two ways and it doesn't light up right away, pull out the
lamp or shut off the power NOW, then try it the other way around.  If
it doesn't light up the other way, pull it out or shut off the power
NOW and consider further.
