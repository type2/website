Subject: Re: [T2] No fire from coil

Thanks for all the suggestions. Some I understand, some I do not.

I'll get a new battery, but since the ign switch is broken it will do no good
for now. I wrote to bus depot to ask if their part is better but have not
gotten a response yet.

I hate my dizzy so am going to buy a new one from the connely site. I think I
will have them put in the compufire while at it.

That is one way just to throw money at the problem. :-(

I'll buy a new coil as well.

Wish me luck

Ric

    For the life of me I can't figure out HOW the HORN circuit can operate by
    hotwiring the ignition coil!
    This has happened to me before...
    The horn already has power,, and needs a ground to complete the circuit!
...
    putting power to the coil straight from the battery can't possibly cause
the
    horn to operate!..... but it does!

    sorry,, I know you want to  make your engine run.. not fix the horn
    circuit...

  hey JaMIE Do you know Doc and have you seen his bus. He and it have won many
crusty bus awards.  LOL  Also he is from Tenn.  :)  (Just picking on ya Doc
you know I love ya man )   IT is strange isn't it. My guess is some how it
completes the ground circuit that make the horn blow.  OH  Doc take a screww
driver and manually make the points fire by opening and shutting them with the
key on. carefull and don't let it shock you  later  Mark D
