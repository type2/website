Michael Holzman just called and confirmed he's ordering 4 little houses for
your private toileting pleasure; also: 

Friday night Pollo Asado Feast (modest donations accepted) bring a side dish
if you'd like to help make it interesting. 

Saturday day trip to Bisbee (tour the mines or the bars or both) or just
stay in camp and practice pitching Sasquatch Chips.

Saturday night dinner you're on your own but judging from the size and girth
of this year's Christmas Tree Sacrifice you'll forget whatever you were
chewing on anyway.

Sunday sleep in and sad sayonara. 

 

Something resembling a child's treasure map will no doubt appear in the
upcoming March News with directions to Holzman's Farm; better yet follow
someone who's been there before.

Personally, since I'll be arriving from the South I'm taking Redington Pass
back to the Valley so if anyone is interested in going the scenic route home
on Sunday let me know. <<ex xmas tree.JPG>>
