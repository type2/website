Subject: Re: [VB] Removing a dist pinion drive

Dave,
	I've carved a piece of wood, something thinnish like lathe and  
tapped that down into the groove.  Gently twist/wiggle the mess along  
with some upward pressure and out it comes.  Make sure to remove the  
little coil spring and don't drop anything down the hole.  Those two  
washers under the drive must not disappear into the block!
