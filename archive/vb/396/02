There was another flurry of info on this a while back when we went thru the 
standard vs. porsche pulleys. Data showed that the faster the engined 
turned, the more air got pushed thru. No limits at 4000 rpm. If your belts 
starts slipping, then the flow tapers off.

My research showed a direct relationship between engine speed and air flow 
from the fan.

I think the R&D shows that the fan stops pushing more air through at about
 4000 rpm.  If you are always above that, it doesn't matter which pulley you
 run.
