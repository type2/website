Subject: Hirschmann bendable antenna...?

Hi!

  Anyone know of what kind of metal is used to create the "bend" in the
bendable portion of the hirschmann antennas?  I just installed safaris and
my dual post antenna wont clear.  I'm trying to fabricate an antenna that
will bend around it like the Hirschmann style?  And still be conductive?

Any suggestions...?

 Aloha, JD
