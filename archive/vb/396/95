Hi Bob,
Sounds like there is something not grounding properly somewhere, and thusly  
this is going through the wiring to the clock and grounding through it.   You 
need to get the wiring diagram for your year VW from vintagebus.com and  with 
a multimeter trace from where the voltage is coming from.
