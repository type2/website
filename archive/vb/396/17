Thanks to everyone involved in this show,  What a great day to be outside

and enjoy your VW Friends. Special thanks to Jerry S. TNT, VW Islands, Wedge

VW, Airkweld VW, the Mom's of the promoters for helping out. A few VW clubs

were noticed by their non-participation. But that has been going on for

years in Phoenix.  Magoo and I do our best to support all promoters, the

politics of the VW Hobby in Phoenix sucks. Again thanks to all, if I missed

a few thanks, please let me know, uj.  Bless all of you for giving me

another great VW Day
