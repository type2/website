There are 1.2 W 12 V lamps, but I'm not sure if they have the right
bases to fit the holders in a splitty.  Take a look at
http://www.type2.com/library/electris/bulbs.html .  All of the 6 V
cars take a "N 17 722 1" lamp for the instruments, which is a "J"
lamp, 6 V, 1.2 W.  Some of the 12 V cars take what is nominally the
12 V version of this lamp "N 17 722 2", which is still a J base, but
has grown to 2 W.  The Ghia, bay Bus, and Type 4 take a different
lamp "N 17 751 2" which is 12 V 1.2 W, but is a "JG" lamp.

I suspect the "J" lamp is the bayonet kind with a round brass base
with two ribs on it, while the "JG" base is the flat pressed glass
base with wire leads folded up on it.

Looking in a Wagner Lighting catalog, they have a part number 11009
for a lamp with a BA7s base (round metal with two ribs) that is rated
at 14.40 V, 1.73 W.  It's not 1.2 W but it's a little less than 2.0 W.
