Has anyone done the "engineering" (LOL) on the tailights for the pre-'62 bus
taillights?

My friend has a set of LED replacement 1157 bulbs in his Vanagon Syncro and
they are fantastic!  Very bright and with the lack of heat, much better for
the lenses.  I will eventually buy a set of those for my Syncro.

The 62-71 buses have bad enough taillight illumination, but the pre '62
buses are plain unsafe on the roads.  I drool over the LED lights that the
MTA buses use, if only they were bus-sized!  Every time I see a lighting
catalogue, that is the first thing I look for.
