I guess I was wrong about "Federal", it really was a brand name in
this case.

AutoZone and O'Reilly both have their parts looker-uppers online now,
so you can get price and availabilitty over the Web.

Did they charge you the $45 core?

I don't know.  I do know that the 009 works a lot better on my engine
than the Porsche 356 distributor that was on it when I got it.  :)
