Subject: Slash rear bumper

I am still reviewing all my parts I got with my 65 DC. I am in bumper mode now.

I have a slash front bumper, which I think is correct, but I have a pointed end rear bumper. I think
this is a 66-67 part based on what is on Wade's site.

Does anyone have a slash rear bumper they want to sell or trade for a pointed end?
