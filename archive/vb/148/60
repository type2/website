Subject: RE: [VB] Slash rear bumper

I have a 1965 deluxe that has two slash bumpers which I believe to be
original. The owner had College registration stickers on the front
bumper from 1968. So unless he wrecked the bumper and then bought a
slash bumper I think they are correct for my deluxe. My bus is early 65
I think they change the rear bumper late in the year.

I thought that it was half-way though the 66 model year...
