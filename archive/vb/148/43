Subject: rear end FS in NC

Hello all,
 I have a small nut transmission and redux boxes in a 63, sposto have been
good when parked in 1979 but that is all I know. $50 for the whole thing, if
you pull it from the vehicle. perfect for putting you beloved bus back to
its stock height.
Located in Charlotte/Concord NC
