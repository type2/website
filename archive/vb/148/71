Pete,

It sounds like you did not have the engine rotated properly, i.e., you though you were at TDC #1 and
you weren't, likewise on #4.

Take those shims out, take the rotor cap off and redo the process making sure the rotor is pointing
to the correct spark plug wire for the cylinder where you are setting the valves.
