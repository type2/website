Subject: Re: [VB] '58 european tail lights

The post brake light mid 57 through 61 euro buses used the same round glass 
taillights used on mid 57-61 buses in the US.  I have noticed that some pre 
62 buses have round holes with two screw holes, and some have indents or ears 
out from th circle, with the ears on top and bottom, like tilting its head 
sideways.  Not sure why or when the difference

screw terminals

think theres a taillight FAQ on vintagebus.com

 European standard that is missing the tail lights. 
 The hole for the tail light has two little holes on
 the top and bottom instead of the the regular hole
 cutouts on 58-61 buses that I'm used to.  Can anyone
 tell me what the tailights for this bus look like or
 where I can find that information?   >>
