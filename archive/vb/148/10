Sorry for the FART, but I read the archives:
Can anyone recommend a company that will insure a 60 doublecab?  The =
truck is restored, will be logo'd, and put into service as a =
work/advertising vehicle that is driven EVERY DAY.  The typical classic =
car insurance will NOT work bc of mileage restrictions and bc it will be =
used for business.  I need "REAL" insurance here, but it seems companies =
just won't take this one.=20
Any help appreciated.  Surely some company can fill my basic need.=20
