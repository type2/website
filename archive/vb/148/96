normally, yeah... but i wanted a c/w crank, and ran across on that 
happened to be attached to a lightened flywheel. the berg pulley has 
extra weight to make up for it, as well as even out the load and 
dampen crank vibrations, so should be cool.
i bought the crank mainly cuz berg won't sell a c/w crank outright, 
and i didn't have a good core, so that added enough extra expense to 
justify buying the crank/fw i got.

later ronnie told me where to get the ones berg sells - oh well :P

if anyone wants an early 80s pauter wedgemated 69mm c/w w/ lightened 
flywheel, let me know and i'll just get a reground c/w crank from dpr!
