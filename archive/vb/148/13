The single cab we are putting together for Jerome Jamboree 12 will be painted 
and at my house to begin assembly this weekend.  I think we are pretty set on 
rubber parts and most mechanical parts but we are still in need of things 
like door handles, mirrors, gas gauge, speedo and the like.  If anyone still 
has interest in helping with parts, please pmail me.  Also, if anyone is 
interested in helping this weekend, we are going to try to get it together 
enough to the Familianfest the following weekend.  Again, if interested, 
pmail me for directions.

Oh, also, we have been offered a repo 'tilt' by Tom Busse but we need bows to 
hang it on.  I know that's a bit much to ask as a donation, but if someone 
has a pair they could sell to us really cheap, that would work.  Let me know 
if we'll get that lucky!!!

Thanks again to everyone who has donated and helped in any way.
