Subject: 15 Window Seat Colors

list:

my *new* '63 15 window is turkis/blue white.  the middle and rear seats are como(?) green, or maybe it's turquoise, i'm not sure.  but they're green.  the front 1/3, 2/3 seat is commercial grey with ivory piping, original material on all 3 seats.  

i've never owned a deluxe, but logic tells me the front seat is either not original to the bus, or at minimum the seat covers are not original to the bus.  

can someone confirm this for me?  it is an early '63, but i can't see VW putting two different color seats in a deluxe.
