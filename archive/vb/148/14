Subject: Reamer and nut size

Who out there is bus land can tell me what size adjustable reamer is required 
to install the center pivot pin bushings/pin in the fron beam of a bus?

Who also out there can tell me what size are the nuts used to hold the 
steering wheel to the column.  I would like to get a die to clean the threads 
and perhaps a couple of new nuts just to have around.

Thanks in advance for the info,
