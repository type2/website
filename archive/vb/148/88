Subject: RGB bolt size?

hi

Can anyone confirm that the stock bolt size is 12 with a 1.5 pitch and
25mm long with 8 (10.9m) hardness?  I've tried every hardware/auto parts
place within 15 miles, noone can come close, so before I go see a guy
called "Mr. Nuts" about 45min away, I want to be sure.

Thanks
