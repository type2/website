he's saying that, for as much ENGINE HORSEPOWER as you save by using 
a power pulley, you don't get as bad a cooling penalty as it seems 
... so if grabbing a few extra ponies  by not turning your fan as 
fast interests you, it's gonna rob 4% LESS cooling effect than you 
thought - WOOHOO!

other page on the site had some interesting comments re: those
