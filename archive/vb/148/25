Subject: New sheet metal saga continues

   After months of waiting to see what the progress was on the new complete
front floors and other sheet metal I called the company that was going to do
the stamping and got some bad and good news.
     The fellow who originally started the project suddenly died 3 months
ago. I guess one of the problems with getting this off the ground were his
health issues for the last year. The good news is, the stamping plant did
get the existing dies and some of the NOS sheet metal and after my
conversation with them yeaterday, have decided to continue on with the
project, except they will be doing it all and not just the stamping. There
first priority is to complete the front floor die and get some product out
in the market place. They have no idea of VW's and I hopefully convienced
them to concentrate on our beloved bus sheet metal and put the bug stuff on
the back burner. They do make sheet metal for another mark of car and will
expand their operations to include the VW BUS.
   What I need are e-mails from everyone interested in product  (and what
pieces) to forward to them to prove there is a big interest in these parts. 
   I have copies of the parts manuals and am sending them all the sheet
metal sections from them and list of what is available from other sources
and there country of origin and quality. Any and all comments on existing
sheet metal would be appreciated so I can also forward these to them.
