Subject: Why a B6 case...

Ok, I asked the question but people want to know why!

engine number
close to the Bus chassis number, or is there some kind of legal or
smog-law issue?


... my response...

None of the above.  Originally, I had my sights on making an early 60's
*hotrod* out of the double cab... with all og parts of course.  Things were
going well until I started trying to decide on a set of wheels for it and
realized that the porsche B brakes that I have gone to so much trouble to
adapt wouldn't allow me to run raders (except with a 3/4" spacer) and I am
saving my set of brms for another project.  Other wheels would work but
realize that most after market wheels for VWs were produced starting in the
early 70's.  Along came the set of american 'baja star' rims and I chose to
go with them.  From my research, these wheels began production in early 1970
and only 200 sets were ever made.  However, this put the kibosh an the idea
of making an early 60's car.  So, I've had to move my time frame.  This has
caused other interesting side effects, like the fact I had to cancel my
order for the Ruiz 40hp Okrasa motor since by 1970, Okrasa was old hat and
lots of new cool goodies were available.  So, I'm off to build a period
correct 2 liter motor from an 82mm spg roller and a set of 88mm empi slipper
skirts as the base....   I have even found a set of original Race Shop FF4
heads.  Just wait till you see the induction system if my plans work out!
