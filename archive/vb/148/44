grease grease grease, your bus loves grease.

Try squirting liquid wrench in the mechanism and turning it a few times to 
lube it.   then work grease into it.  put a dab of grease where the latch 
strikes the catch

If any other latch mechanisms are sticky, remove any panelling in the way and 
do the same to the door mechanisms.  If you are inspired to remove th cargo 
door mechs,  tie a string or something to hold the upper check rods from 
falling through the doors, as they are a pita to put back.

oil your hinges every 1200 miles, VW said .  grease your suspension every 
tune up.  grease grease grease.  grease is good.

<< Hey Folks,
  I acquired a 66 Westy a few weeks ago and looked at another last evening.
 I am now gonna have to start with all the questions.
  I choose to start easy, I have noticed on both, that the engine hatch has
 an extreme difficult time latching.
  My imagination?  Just a coincidence that both have this problem?  Is it
 typical?  Any quick fixes? >>
