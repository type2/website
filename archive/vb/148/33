Yes.  I have considered that one of these would make a nice way to build a
bypass cooler/filter setup.  Take a line from the sump, run it through the
AT side of the pump, then through a filter/cooler, then back to the sump
via the generator stand.  That way the filter and cooler doesn't interfere
with the pressure delivered to the engine.
