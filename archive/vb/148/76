Hi all,

A buddy of mine is starting to put the word out that he will be privately=
 selling his very nice (magazine featured!) 1961 Westfalia Camper very so=
on.  I thought someone here might be interested in adding it to their Typ=
e 2 fleet!  The price for this ready to drive/camp/show Type 2 seems quit=
e fair to me in todays marketplace, considering the cost of locating/buyi=
ng a "beater" and then paying goobs of $'s to restore one back to this co=
ndition.  This one's ready to enjoy right now!  It is located in Detroit,=
 MI and is obviously garage stored and very well cared for.  Al is a good=
, honest VW enthusiast, and works at a VW shop and knows his stuff.  It i=
s usually parked at the event booth every year at the May "MVVC Festival"=
 show at VWoA headquarters, so some of you may have already seen it.  I n=
ever imagined that it would become available.  It's a very nice finished =
vintage camper!  Contact Al for more info...
