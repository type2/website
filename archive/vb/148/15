Hey Pete,

You may or may not remember that this happened to me as well. Except I 
actually lost the wheel. Lucky for me no one got hurt and it only tore up 
the front driver's dogleg.

I was spooked for quite a while and would find myself pulling to the side 
of the HWY for no reason and checking the luckbolts. I felt like an 
obsessive compulsive person! Eventually it goes away...but not all the way. 
But I think that's good. It keeps you checking them...which is what you 
gotta do. Check 'em every now and then to make sure all is good. It's not 
an uncommon problem.

Search the archives for "do I need therapy" and you'll see what people told me.
