Subject: Re: [VB] Brosol, how bad?

I dunno why people dump on Brosol carbs.  I've had one (the same one) on my 
bug for ten years.

I don't like 34-picts, but that is because if they go bad they are a PITA to 
clean out so I put a sp cab on w/ adaptor.  

But... if it isn't broken, no need to fix it.  Don't worry about it, as long 
as the gas isn't leaking or anything.

 I was going through the 1600DP that came with my '65 DC and lo' and behold, 
I've got a 34 pict-3
 Brosol carb on it. How bad are they? Is it bad enough that I should look 
into replacing it?
