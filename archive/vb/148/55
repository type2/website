I don't recall the name of the product, as it was 8 years ago, but it came
in small metal cans, which I recall were pressurized, and may have used an
auxiliary transferrable spray/handle. It's been a long time, but I
remember my resto-guy handing me a case of the cans, and I think a spray
handle that was designed to be used with them, one at a time.

I remember being really impressed with the performance of the stuff.

Sorry I can't recall more.  The stuff would be obtained from an auto body
supply house.
