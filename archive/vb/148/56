I'd love to have an 8-track/am/fm - i'd assume the CB is a separate unit -
i'd also like to have a CB.  Anyway, I found a NOS 8-track/fm player on ebay
for about $22.00 http://cgi.ebay.ca/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=884548127
I had to change the rubber belt inside as it had decomposed over the past 30
years? but once I replaced the belt with one from a VHS machine the 8-track
works perfectly.  Pretty much all old 8-track players need to have the
rubber belt replaced but it is very easy to do and the belts are very easy
to find.  Of course virtually all tapes must be repaired but that's a
relatively easy thing to do.  The 8-track started as a bit of a joke and it
has become an obsession.  Initially I found a player and a box of tapes for
$5.00 at a garage sale a few years ago so I bought it ..... now I have about
300 tapes all of which I've taken apart and repaired - they now all work
like new.  I'm more of a CBC (Canadian Public Radio) guy anyway so the
8-track is more for fun and the FM is what counts.
