Subject: RE: [VB] "Real" insurance

I have Rosie (restored '63 DC) insured with AAA for an agreed value of
$15,000. No special restrictions, just keep all of your receipts and get a
professional appraisal as a backup. The agent definitely raised an eyebrow
when I told her how much insurance I wanted, but when we walked to the
parking lot to take pictures she understood.
