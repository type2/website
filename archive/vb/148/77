  I just sold a 63 standard and the original upolstery on the front, middle
and rear seats were a solid green with sewn in pleats and the 2 tone panels.

contact doug at transporter restorations/aka upolstery haus, he will have
definate answers for you being he has probally restored more 63's then
anyone else

sounds like the front seat has been changed

list:

my *new* '63 15 window is turkis/blue white.  the middle and rear seats are
como(?) green, or maybe it's turquoise, i'm not sure.  but they're green.
the front 1/3, 2/3 seat is commercial grey with ivory piping, original
material on all 3 seats.  

i've never owned a deluxe, but logic tells me the front seat is either not
original to the bus, or at minimum the seat covers are not original to the
bus.  

can someone confirm this for me?  it is an early '63, but i can't see VW
putting two different color seats in a deluxe.
