Subject: '58 european tail lights

List members, I have a friend who picked up a 1958
European standard that is missing the tail lights. 
The hole for the tail light has two little holes on
the top and bottom instead of the the regular hole
cutouts on 58-61 buses that I'm used to.  Can anyone
tell me what the tailights for this bus look like or
where I can find that information?
