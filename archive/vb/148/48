Subject: Bus Puzzler - Need Help

Here's a puzzler that I'm living with right now:

'67 deluxe. runs great. starts up just perfectly when cold.

ride around for 15-30 minutes, and when I shut the ignition off, it 
will not restart. no noise, no starter, nothing.

battery is fine. lights work.

I let the bus sit for 30-45min., try it again, and it starts right up!

does this sound familiar to anyone? any suggestions? I have replaced 
the keyed ignition switch, but it doesn't prevent this from happening.
any help would be much appreciated!
TIA,
-DB
