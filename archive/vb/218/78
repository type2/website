Subject: Speedo question . . . 

Long time listener, third time caller . . . 
With the vast amount of knowledge floating around on this list, maybe someone 
can point me in the right direction. What did this speedo come out of? I 
found it digging around in my buddy's parts box. He has no idea what it came 
from. The part number is 111 957 023E. Pictures are posted on Everett's site.
