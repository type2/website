 This might be the biodiesel formula they are using in some sort of
 diesel engine.

Ya, I bet it is biodiesel.  There are a lot of people into biodiesel these 
days.  usually they are really annoying, have poor personal hygiene and leave 
their nasty goo all over the lab.    Not that I have issue with the concept 
of biodiesel, seems good in principle.  Seems that one of the marinas in town 
sell it at a pump for use on boats.

Think the engine needs to be retuned slightly, but no big deal.  Works for 
diesel engines.   
You can't use the cooking oil straight, it has to be converted into diesel 
fuel, which is a simple process.
