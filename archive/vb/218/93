Can I get an "Amen?"

A few years ago, I bought a sawzall; the real Milwaukee one.  A friend
of mine went thru 3 in just a couple days on a fence project, then he borrowed
mine and finished the job with no drama.  I recently replaced the Sawzall because 
the collet that holds the blades broke - everthing else was perfect.  I bought a new
one of the same model, and they've improved the collet design.  Some day,
I'llget off my ass and order a replacement part for the old one, but I 
needed the saw in a hurry on the day it broke.
