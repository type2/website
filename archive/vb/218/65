Check the spark, ala Muir.   Check the timing statically, and the plug wires.

Is it getting gas?   Sure it isn't out or you didn't accidently pull the 
reserve lever to off?  Have a friend crank it while you watch to see if the 
gas gets pumped, or with key offremove inlet tube to carb, and crank the 
engine by hand.  

Could also try getting a can of gas and using a clean rattle can cap, dump a 
little down the top of the carb.  Then crank it, if it jumps to life then 
fizzles out you have a gas delivery issue.
