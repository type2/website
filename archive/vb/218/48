I've not done this, but to replace alt brushes you just remove 3 screws
and the brush carrier comes right out of the top of the alternator.
These brushes carry only the field current, not the full current of the
alternator, and they ride on slip rings, not segmented rings.  This means
that the alternator brushes will last a very long time!

Another nice thing about the alternator is that it is quite a bit lighter
than the generator it replaces.  It makes maneuvering the assembly into
place a lot easier, particularly when the engine is in the vehicle.
