Subject: Re: [VB] Atlternator vs Generator

Hi Kevin,
Since you already have a generator and do not have any huge wattage needs you 
probably are best off sticking with the generator.  Alternators are nice, but 
seem to be a bit less robust and you have to remove and dissassemble it to 
replace the brushes.
