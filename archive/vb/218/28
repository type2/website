Subject: re: Keeps eating wheel bearings?

I'm using wheel bearing grease.

I'm wondering about the tightening tho.  I tighten it sung, but so that
I ca still move the washer with a bit of force.

Also, its possible that one brake pad is not adjusted right...I'll be
fixing that today.

I'm also pretty sure my alignment is off, but the tires arean't showing
any wear...

Does any of this sound like it would lead to wheel bearing death?
