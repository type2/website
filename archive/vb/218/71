The drawback to biodiesel is that the supply of raw fuel is rather
limited.  If you have a burger place and can run your delivery vehicle on
the french fry oil you are in good shape, but the supply of such material
is limited for the public in general.  Yes, you can make biodiesel to be
used directly, but in that case the cost is high and it takes quite a bit
of regular diesel (tractor fuel) to make the biodiesel
