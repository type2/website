Subject: Small Truck Bed section needed....

Got a friend who needs a 1 1/2 ft. long (font to back of vehicle) by 1ft. 
wide piece of truck bed metal.

Anybody got a donor? OR  can it be bought new?

It's different from bus cargo floor...right?

Is there some chevy or toyota metal that would be a good substitute?

Looking for ideas ASAP.

Thanks a ton.
