Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Atlternator vs Generator

What about those new 'solid sata' or whatever regulators.  A year or so ago I 
got a new generator and regulaotor, and the reg was funny looking.  No longer 
could I undo a screw, take the covers off and look at the points in them.  
Are they going to fry in the EMP?

BTW, any one know how to test regulators w/o installing them?

 A generator with a mechanical voltage regulator (relays) should be much
 more immune to the electromagnetic pulse from a nuclear blast than an
 alternator with diodes.
 
 Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta finish filling up the Bus with ammo, Spam,
 and bottled water before I head back up to the cabin.
