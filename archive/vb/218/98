I say, Amen, brother.  If I never use those pliers again (but I will), it
was worth $20 to take those things out with zero hassle.  Sometimes you
can get away with cheap tools for occasional use when the quality issue
just means they won't last as long -- but in this and many cases, the
*operation* of the tool is so much better.

I know Craftsman's not perfect but I've been pretty happy with them for 30
years.

Hallelujah,
