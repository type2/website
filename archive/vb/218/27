Subject: RE: [VB] Unsubscribing

Sorry about that, I was realy frustrated last night. Kind words from a few
here, and a nice new day fixed me up. I am consulting with a local shop when
I can get the bread togther, and getting her back on the road. I should be
used to it never being simple.

Guess your all stuck with me.
