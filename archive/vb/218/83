Volks,

Nobody is going to hazard an opinion on those KYG gas shocks?  Maybe its
because I forgot to mention they are gas shocks.  Camber my rear wheels
fierce.  Is this a bad thing?  I can remember camber impaired busses and bugs
when I was a kid--obviously this was back in the daze of swing axles, remember
though, the 50's and 60s WERE swinging times.
