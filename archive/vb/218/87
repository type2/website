Subject: I saw a beautiful

66 21W in Fresno, Calif today. It was on a transport truck. It was going back to Castro Valley. [near Haywood]
The truck driver picked it up in Las Vegas at a Mervyns show?!?
It was blue and white. Appeared to be 'wrapped' below the deluxe trim. On the sides it said 'Mervyn's
SIDEOUT'. On the back it said Chillout. It had a Calif personalized plate: CHLLOUT.
The only minus to the bus was that it was on the lower level. Whatever car that had been above it, had
leaked/dripped oil onto the roof of the bus. It was running down into the drip rail. I could not see if the
sunroof was oil splattered.
Any one know of it?
