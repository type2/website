Subject: Interesting Trans Problem

The transmission in my '60 DD has been getting sort of 'balky' -
I'd have to shift it very carefully to get it in gear.  It
wasn't grinding or anything, it's just that I wasn't finding
the gears.

I climbed under it today to see what was up, thinking maybe the
coupler was having issues or the clutch cable was fraying.  Nope.
The brass bushing in the end of the nose cone slid out!  I've
never seen or heard of this happening before, but there it is,
plain as day.

So now I get to spend several hours of work to replace a 50c bushing.  Yay.
