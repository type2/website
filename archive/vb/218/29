That does not sound so good.  We put everything together and then spin the 
tire to help seat the bearings and snug the locking nut down till you feel 
the bearings stopping the nut from snugging down anymore.  Then we turn the 
nut back off 1/8 to 1/6 of a turn and lock it there.

That should not be effecting the bearings, but is a good idea for best 
brakes.

Also make sure to check your front suspension camber shims are properly set.  
If the bearings still are going bad after all this you need to replace that 
spindle.  Could be that side is bent.
