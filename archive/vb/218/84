Subject: Re: Repro plastic / rubber

For what it's worth, seals and "soft rubber" aren't in the game plan at 
all. There are too many variables.
I'm talking clear plastic (lenses, etc.) and hard rubber parts.

I have a few lenses going right now T34 tail lights (Euro and American) 
T34 Front turn signals (clear and orange) as well as a couple different 
T3 and Bus lenses.
