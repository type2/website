I agree. My problem is I can't afford the good stuff. What I have to do is buy tools as cheap as I
can, use them till they break, and then buy another one next time I need it. Oddly enough, I have a
lot of cheap tools in my box that I've had for ten years or more. Sometimes you get lucky. Either
that or my bus feels sorry for me and is extra kind to my tools.

I'm gonna say this and it don't matter how poor you are: when you buy a
tool, you go for the best that you can afford, and Sears Craftsman is near
the top and guaranteed for life. The best you can afford means that you
buy the Craftsman tool, not the Harbor Freight junk. If you have a lot of
money, you buy Craftsman or you go up to Proto or SnapOn, or Allen, etc.
