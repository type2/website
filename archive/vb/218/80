Subject: Distributor piece wanted...

Hi all,

I'm trying to locate a specific "clip" that holds down the distributor cap on
a ZV/PAU 4 R 5 40 hp distributor.  If you happen to have a junk ZV/PAU 4 R 5
distributor in your spare parts pile, I'd love to buy the clip (or even the
whole junk distributor)to make my distributor complete.  The clip I need looks
like it is unique to this particular distributor.  Using a caliper, the clip
is approximately 49 mm long from one end to the other end (not counting the
small mounting plate that the screw goes thru), and it's 9mm wide.  Most later
ones are 8 mm or less wide.  Sorry to be anal about it, but if it's not the
right clip from a ZV/PAU 4 R 5 distributor, the distributor cap won't mount
down tightly etc.  Thanks for looking, and if you have the little
"thingamajig", please e-mail me.
