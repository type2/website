Front doors full of insulation.......bad idea! What was trying to be
acomplished noise deadening and/or keeping heat in the bus?

If noise is a concern use some 3M asphalt panels in the inside of the door
to stop the door metal vibrating...... Also make sure there is a plastic
liner between the door and the door panel otherwise the panel will get wet
and moldy as well......
