I have these going on...

I put the first one on the front of my bus a week ago, it pushed the 
spindle as far down as it could go. I had to use a jack to push up the 
eyelet so I could get it on. Now that it's on, I'm going to have to 
jack up the bus another 4" to get enough clearance for the tire. That's 
some difference.

So I'm going to have to get used to the tall ride, which is OK, but I 
wasn't expecting that much of a difference. Your comments on the back 
shocks worries me though. At least the back ones I have are used.

I guess the deal is to get some more weight into my bus. My floor is 
full of holes which has probably made the front end too light. Maybe 
some concrete reinforcement or patio bricks...
