I am well beyond my frustration point with this bus I can never get to run.
Thanks to all for the support over the last few years, it wouldn't have
wheels or roll if it wasn't for the group here, but I get little joy any
longer in continually failing in every effort I make. I guess I'm just not
cut out for this.

Goodbye all, and thanks.
