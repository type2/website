Subject: M code plates..........

In the past 4 days I have either looked at, or heard of 4 different 
Buses 60-61 delivered to the US that had no "L" number for the color, 
but rather "Blue" or "Grey", etc.
2 Double Cabs, 1 Panel (converted to an EZ), and 1 Panel (converted to a 
Roadrunner)

Is this something that happened during that time period, or something to 
do with "commercial" vehicles??
