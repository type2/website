Hi Greg,
The first digit of the part number tells one it is for type 1.  If it was a 2 
it would be specificly for a type 2, or a 3 would be a type 3.  The next two 
digits tells it was used on standard bug.  Though if you go to the type 1 
parts manual it is for M20, and 111-118, 151, 152 models.  The next digit "9" 
indicates it is an electrical part.
