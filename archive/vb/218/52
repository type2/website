I agree with George that the bearing races may have been incorrectly 
installed.  Markus, you replaces the races, right?  This is an easy job 
but also easy to get wrong if you do not appreciate the issues at hand.  
The races need to be seated all the way down in their holes.  Leave a 
gap here and things will not work.  Good luck.  You do need to do this 
job over.  Roller bearing!  Try doing the older ball bears.  Fun too!
