Hi Andy,
Ah, OK.  There is no tightening done.  You just are feeling for the moment of 
contact.  Much like when you put down a glass/cup/mug on a counter top 
without needing to survey this operation from several angles at the same 
time. ;-)  You can just feel the lightest touch of contact and know it is 
down.
