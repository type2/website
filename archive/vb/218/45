Subject: CB performance Air/Fuel Ratio Gauge

I have a CB Performance Air/Fuel Ration Gauge, and have lost the
instructions.

If anyone can tell me what the wires are for, I would appreciate it.

It has a bundle of three wires, black, red, and green, and a forth wire that
is black at the bottom of the gauge.

Thanks
Charles
