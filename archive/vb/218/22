Subject: Keeps eating wheel bearings?

My bus has developed a chronic wheel bearing problem.

Its eating front wheel bearings with astonishing regularity.  Like ever 200 or
so miles.

Driver front is the problem area.

Switched drums left to right, problem stayed on the drives side.

Replaced spindle with a another used one, problem seems to be coming back.

Any ideas?  Alignment?  Brake adjustment?

I'm out of ideas but need the bus in a week for a FL trip for three weeks.
