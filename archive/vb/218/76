Jim,
If I can pry the digital camera away from my fiancee' i'll send you a pic. My ID plate on the overhead fan has "-42" on it after the model number as well.  
When I redid my seats a few years back I even found a date stamp on a peice of paper fastened to the seat pad!

This is why some people appear bright until you hear them 
speak.
