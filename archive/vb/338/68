Subject: Re: [VB] Baywindow exhaust question

I have an extractor exhaust taken off a salvage-yard 914 a few years back. It doesn't look like an $1,800 exhaust. 
Maybe a good old fashioned muffler shop (GOFMS?) could fab one up using stock manifold. Check out the upright Type-4 sites for their solution.
