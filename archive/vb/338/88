Hi Brooks,
The problem is to do the powder coating right you need to sandblast the  
parts first to give the coating a roughness to grip.  Otherwise the coating  will 
peel off easily.  
  If the parts are an exterior item getting them first Marine  Zinc Primered 
is a must before the color coating.  
  Lastly to get the coating as even as possible you have to  electrostaticly 
charge the parts so the powder clings to them.
  If the powder coater is expensive, shop around, we found a nice  family run 
shop (Ken's Powdercoating, maybe they would do your parts via  mail?) that 
does our rims for $35.00 each.  That included  sandblasting, Marine zinc primer, 
color coating the inside of the rims semi  gloss black, and the outsides the 
special Chamelion color that we special  ordered through them years before, 
but only had a few pounds left and this color  is now NLA.  Powdercoating is 
only supposed to be good on the shelf for  about 6 months, after that the powder 
cakes up badly, but this shop has figured  out how to repowderize it!
  On our first try to get things powdercoated at a shop in Seattle we  had to 
go in three times and got the run around including they would not do our  
rims because they knew they would not seal afterward.  Which we told them  we 
would accept that risk.  On the third try we finally got the owner and  he told 
us he did not want to deal with rusty old parts only newly manufactured  stuff 
in the 1,000s of units.
  So far over 30 rims we have PCed and none have had air leakage  issues!
