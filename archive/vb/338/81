Dave,

I have one and have used it for several years.

Powder coating Works great!  The only problem I see for you is that I 
doubt that a toaster oven would provide the necessary heat.

Generally 350-400 degrees for 20 minutes after powder flow.

The other part is that unless you have a way to "hang" the parts in the 
oven after powder coating(this is often tricky), you will have flaws in it 
where you set it on something.

Do *NOT* use your regular oven for this.

I bought a used electric oven for less than $100...powder coated almost 
everything(even the heater boxes) on my t4 engine except the front cross 
tin...just too big.

Cheers, dave
