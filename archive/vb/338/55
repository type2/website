Kevin, JB used to rebuild the SW heaters in Castle Rock CO, but hasn't for a
number of years now.  He did a great job on the heaters, really quality
work.  When JB no longer sold parts, I became a South Wind Volkswagen
factory rep, I sell the parts that are still being produce along with a few
that are no longer in production.  I also have purchased a number of used
heaters, so I have a pretty good supply of used parts along with being able
to have the motors rebuilt.  If the combustion motor doesn't turn at 2,000
RPM, the heater will smoke from lack of air.

I have got to update my parts page, the factory raised the prices and I
haven't had a chance to update.  My parts page can be found at:

That heater is a combo of parts from different models and is incomplete to
make any of the different units. Price is not bad for the parts though. I
would just get a choke cable from WW and install a toggle to run the heater
power. If you do buy that heater I am intrested in a few of the pieces. JB's

may have the stock switch.
