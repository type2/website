Hi Shawn, 
Use good old Comet and an old tooth brush to clean them.  After  rinsing 
throughly and drying apply glycerin to soften the OG vynil and after  over night 
wipe off the excess.

powdercating them, does anyone know of a good shop here in the Tacoma

Try Ken's Powdercoating near Puyallup.  Please tell them Eric&Barb  said
