  I tried to explan the rat look and the dull paint is what I wanted. I then asked if they have a problem insuring 
primmered 50's style street rods and his answer was no!! So my agent is persuing every possable angle. Pollamns 
underwriters just has something against VW buses now. I guess they fiqured out that they do get driven a lot and 
Pollmans has no mileage  or really any other restrictions. You can drive to the store and/or work with their policy as 
long as it is not your primary means of transpo.
