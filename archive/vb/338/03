Subject: Re: [VB] winter is coming-heater question

I used a late model bay window bus heater cable (they're sheathed like a
bike brake cable) to run my old SW heater in my 64 bus. It was just long
enough to reach up to the dash by making my own control lever. It worked
very well, but unfortunatly was not an OG looking switch like you're after.
But if you're looking for something that you can make work (quite well at
that), this may be a route to go.
