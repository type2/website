Subject: Re: [VB] re: classic insurance

  The problem is I used OMNI paint by PPG, the worse paint ever made. It started to fade in a year and by the 4th year
what you see is what I got (it's now 7 years old). I have tried numerous compounds and it won't bring the color back, 
to get a shine I just WD 40 it. I have been working with Pullmans insurance and so far they will go 7500 on it but need 
another photo of the rear to show it doesn't have a hitch???? and I also need to remove the rack, for some reason the 
underwriter doesn't like full length industrial racks on buses!!! Then in a couple months I will WD it and send new 
shinney pics to up the value. But for 50/75 dollars a year for full coverage I can't complain.
