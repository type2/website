Sean, I've got Rachel here now for the time between
Jerome and Busses and Balloons, and we've been getting
lots done, but it's three weeks, not just one.

Anybody wanting to go from one to the other next year
is welcome; just come ready to work on your or my
vehicles!

Come to Busses and Balloons October 1st and 2nd:  lots
of busses and a free lunch Saturday and 1000 hot air
balloons!
