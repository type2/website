Subject: rear bumper splash pan

Hi,
I am new to this list. I own a couple of type 2 and a friend of mine is
restoring a 56 panel and he want it as stock as possible (his choice). I
probably will have some questions in the future about that projet. My first
one is about the rear bumper splash pan. Is the bumper splash pan was only for
the deluxe or for the full line bus including the panel?
In my garage I am working on a Samba 66, it's an old restoration in great
shape that passed the last 15 years in a barn. It need a good clean out (mice
had fun in the headliner) and a tune up. It came without the middle seat and
the back seat. I may put and older middle seat that I have (late fifty) and I
am looking for a backseat not to far from my place.
Sorry about my english...by the way if you want to practice your french and
