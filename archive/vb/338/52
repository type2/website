That heater is a combo of parts from different models and is incomplete to
make any of the different units. Price is not bad for the parts though. I
would just get a choke cable from WW and install a toggle to run the heater
power. If you do buy that heater I am intrested in a few of the pieces. JB's

may have the stock switch.
