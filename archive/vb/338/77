Subject: RE: Re: Cleaning armrests, in need of a seat armrest and in

I tried the commet for about 30 minutes on a spot about the size of a
quarter, after all the scrubbing it still looks the same. I also tried a
gel bleach pen for about 10 minutes but that didn't work either (I was
scared to try longer).

For powder coating, I have to meet with the city attorney of Puyallup
tomorrow about one of my work sites, I will swing by Kens PC on my way
into town and see about the seat frames then probably Tacoma PC at
lunch. anyone have a ball park idea of what they should cost me? Shawn

Hi Shawn, 
Use good old Comet and an old tooth brush to clean them.  After  rinsing

throughly and drying apply glycerin to soften the OG vynil and after
over night 
wipe off the excess.


Try Ken's Powdercoating near Puyallup.  Please tell them Eric&Barb  said
