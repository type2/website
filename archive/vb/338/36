There is always a generation gap to cross.

When I first went to a VW show, there were guys wearing knee-high socks 
with baby-blue shorts, tucked in yellow penguin shirts and trucker hats 
that said, "I [heart] my 65 vert". I don't remember seeing any women 
there that didn't think of me as a "nice young man". Back then I had to 
wiggle myself into conversations about main jets and timing. As soon as 
I was noticed, the conversation ended.

Then for a while shows were scarce - and so was I.

The shows picked back up and all of a sudden, there were young people. 
Unfortunately by the time this happened, I had a belly and was losing 
my hair. I don't have piercings or tattoos, no bags or bottles - so I 
can't hang. And I still have to wiggle into conversations about main 
jets and timing.

But, I do eventually end up meeting one or two people and having a long 
and interesting conversation - and it makes it all worthwhile.
