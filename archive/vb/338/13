Sounds like the guy we were camped across from last year-sorry I missed
camping by him again, & you had to get him on your first visit to Jerome!

Volks tend to hang w/ people they know-Unless you are really outgoing & make
an effort, it might seem like volks are standoffish or cliquish. I
think/have walked into many groups where you don't know a soul, & have
developed new friends almost every time.  Bill in Melvan-the bumper sticker
bus, picked up a homeless looking hitchhiker & brought him to Jerome. The
guy camped in the dirt under a tent trailer, became part of the group, so
much so that the group pitched in to buy him 20-30 bucks worth of raffle
tickets so he could be part of the fun- turns out he won the Koch steering
wheel certificate, which he had auctioned off to someone who needed it, &
walked out of the Jamboree w/ $100 +- in his pocket, & the impression that
Volks are the friendliest/most laid back people he had ever run into.

Sorry I missed you- I was camped w/ Beto's/Fu's/JP/Rachel/Laffoon/etc. Group
also.

The Fu's/Pina's went way over the top buying/preparing/cooking for anybody
that wanted to eat!

The event was actually not that hot this year in the shade-it can be a lot
hotter & a lot cooler depending on the year.  "SHADE, SHADE, SHADE IS GOOD"
at Jerome, to parody Clara a tad.
