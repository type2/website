For now, yup...   hopefully I'll stop feeling like I'm driving.   did you 
know you can get a crick in your neck when driving north with a wind coming from 
the left for about 300 miles?  Really, it's true.    and they have some good 
radio stations in Reno, Nev.  and CA gas prices suck, but you knew that.     
and the SMV magnet made driving easier... fewer tailgaters.  

...... more, with pictures,  later........
