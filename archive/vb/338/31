Subject: More Jerome Photos on Samba...

I just uploaded 15 additional photos of last weekend's Jerome show. It seems
like it was the people and creatures more than the buses that caught my eye.

Go to http://thesamba.com/vw/forum/album.php
and/or filter using keywords [ AZ Bus Club - Jerome 2004 ]
without the brackets.
Regards to all,
