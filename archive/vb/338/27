Subject: Re: [VB] re: classic insurance

  I have all my vehicles with Farmers ( all my VW's are liability only and cost 100 or so per year each) except my wifes 
65 beetle, it's with Pullman. I just got turned down again on another bus by Pullmans, they are getting stricter and 
stricter as to what they will cover, specially at replacement value. They now go by Old Car Guide or something like that 
and if your model isn't listed it's hard to get stated value, or even current market. They are also getting very picky on 
APPEARANCE of the vehicle, my DD is faded paint 7 years old, was turned down because, and yes this is what they told 
me "It isn't shinney enough". My agent said polish it and it will go through, HUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. So next week it's 
WD40 time (yes it can make a dull bus shine), shoot some new pics (now they want a portfolio of pics where as 1 use 
to be enough) and I'm sure it will get covered, but not for near what I have invested!!!!!!!! Even with reciepts, a liget 
apprasial and comps will they cover it for what I asked.
