Hi Mike,
There is a lot of work to be done there but if it's as
complete as it looks......in fact even if it isn't
$500 is a complete steal.
I'd buy it even though I'm midway through another
project.
I don't think you have any illusions about what it's
really like from what you said in your email and also
from the pics you've taken.
Grab it before some other lucky dog does.
:o)
Cheers
