Subject: Wiring Q's

I have a spaghetti question. In my Westfalia ('65) when I pull the emergency light switch to on, all of my turn signal lights light up (So far so good) but only the pass front signal flashes ? Could it be because my flasher and emergency relay are different voltages? Everything else works fine,. Well, except for my cd player , but that is aftermarket safari window related!

Shouldn't all of them flash or do I have some kind of crazy Austrian M-code?!!!!

I have the original wiring except for:

12 Conversion

Dual bulb rear taillight assem (disconnected 1 wire from stop light switch and ran new line to rear of bus)

12 volt wagoner 4 prong flasher (passenger side)

Light travels faster than sound. 
This is why some people appear bright until you hear them 
speak.
