Well, I don't know if I'd say "complete steal".  That's a lot of holes
for 500 bucks!  Depends where you are located though.  Do you weld? 
Have a welder? Have the money for parts? Have time?  Where is the camper
interior??  

He had to be high on crack to want 1500 originally.  I'd still offer him
less...he's desperate, right?
