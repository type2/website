Hi Paul&Jake,
There are tools for removing broken taps that have three or four arms to grab 
the flutes of the broken tap and turn out the remains if not totally stuck.
  Drilling hardened steel of taps is a waste of time and only using small 
grinding bits will slowly remove the tap remains.
  If the tap was HSS (high speed steel) it will be easily brken into small 
bits with a hammer and punch, though this will somewhat damage the treads and 
will require redressing with a tap.
  Best thing when tapping is to prevent locking up the tap in the hole in the 
first place.  This requires the use of tapping fluid or at least a good oil.  
Most of all, when tapping to remember to turn in one turn and just over a 
half turn back out and keep repeating this till the tapping is complete.  
This insures the metal shavings created by the tapping operation are very 
short in length and much less likely to get wedged  in between the internal 
threads and the tap and lock it up.
