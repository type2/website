First thing I'd do would be to give it a compleat tune up, lube every thing 
that moves an dthe suspension, check all fluids, tranny boots (change gear 
oil).  How's your timing?   How are the plug wires?  

Check the brakes.  Is anything dragging?    Replace anything needed, 
including brake flex hoses if they are over 5 years old, or look bad.    My 
usual test is to bleed the brakes.  It should pump a good spurt out really 
easy, the pedal pusher should not have to push hard at all.  or if you jack 
the bus up, spin the wheel, then step on the brake, now spin the wheel by 
hand, it should spin.  If it is dragging, you have a brake issue. 

What size engine and tranny gearing do you have?  A really high geared tranny 
will make a regular size engine feel really wimpy.   do you have 36mm or 46mm 
rear axle nuts?
