Subject: Re: [VB] 1966 van purchase advice

because it has the engine, I'd say maybe $500...but no more for sure.

I bought a few busses in comparable condition...but without engines...for 
$100 and $200. The first had no title and was maybe a little rustier, but 
more complete. The second did have a title and is fairly solid but dented 
up pretty good. Tried to sell them both for basically what I paid and 
couldn't. That's after having people tell me they were "worth saving". So 
watch out for advice from this list like that. Make sure you've got a place 
to store it for a long time.

There's tons of work to do on that bus. Can be done...but don't underestimate.

Just my opinion.
