That's funny, I just noticed recently that my 67 has started to do this
too! Havn't taken the time to diagnose, but it'll prolly be a corroded
wire or else, the only other thing will be corrosion on one of the relay
contacts inside the 9-prong sig-flasher box. My turn sigs work fine all
around, but on emergency mode, the left front doesn't flash.

Someday...
