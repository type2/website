It has always amazed me that you gained relatively little HP when you went
from the 71 T2-1600 to the 72 T-2 1700. The increased SAE HP with the 1700 was
devoted to the T-4 cars and later grudgingly given back to the T-2 buses. With
a few bolt ons you can equal and exceed factory specs for the 72 1700 on the
71 1600. Less the bullet proof case of course.

just an observation

I don't know, but these two manuals together should give you the stock
specifications for everything VW put out from December '53 (start of 36
hp) through the '73 model year.
