Subject: Friday: Bus sighting in a movie

Hi guys,
I'm not sure if anyone's mentioned this one before but
my wife & I just sat through "Almost Famous" & almost
had a bus-sighting overload.
It's set in the early 70's and is jam PACKED full of
split windows and a couple of bays as well.
It was one bus after another for most of the film and
I was totally blown away by some of the really nice
ones and also the authentic "worn" ones.
They really did their homework in terms of what was
around at the time in cars in general.
Anyhow, I'll stop gushing.
If you like rock & roll, a thought-provoking film &
LOTS of buses then this is the movie for you.
Rent it ASAP!
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
