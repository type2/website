  The cargo Van was in Japan yesterday, on it's way here. It will be in the
port of LA on March 15, I get to pick it up on the 18th. I am going to leave
it as is for the first year then do a total restore on it to look like the
picture of the one in the new SPEC GUIDE, then LOGO it for the shop.
  When I pick it up I will have 2 days to do the total drive train so it
will be ready to race at VW Drag Days on the 23rd of March.
  It does run and drive as it was driven onto the ship and hopefully will
still drive off. There was some quick fixes done to it in OZ to get it
mobil.

ps. Ed Hughs or anybody that knows him, contact me asap as your parts are in
the van

So,

Ronnie, you having the military fly your knu Toorak Dry Cleaners delivery
van
over for the convoy?  ;-]

What are you going to do with it, anyway?  Restoration?  Paint?  What shape
is
the engine/tranny in?  Rust?  Inquiring minds wanna know.  Or do you have it
yet?  If not tell us about it when it arrives.  DETAILS!  You gonna change
it
over to L-H drive?

BTW, you guys forgot to charge me for the VW front emblem I got back in
Jan.,
with the tranny.  Tell you what.  . . . Instead of settling up, you can
throw
me in the lake next year!

Curt . . . Your "best" customer
