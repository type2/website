Matt,
Thanks for your reply. I am going to print it up and fool around with it this weekend.It is really strange but that is what happens, all lights go on and the pass front blinks! But all of my lights do work: headlights signals, brakes, everything. 
The rear lights I did right too, as they have worked perfect for years. The light stayed as the "light" wire, original signal/brake became signal and the new wire I ran became brake.
I'll check the rest this weekend. 
Thanks again, I appreciate it.
Sean


Light travels faster than sound. 
This is why some people appear bright until you hear them 
speak.
