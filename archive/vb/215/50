Mine did that also, even after building and installing the Matt Roberdson
special. I pulled the emergency switch after I noticed I could get it to work
when I wiggled the handle around. I replaced the emergency switch with a 6
pole double throw switch I had laying on the shelf utilizing the contacts I
needed. The light is hanging off a couple of wires under the dash in the tray.
Rarely use the flasher so Haven't got around to restoring it to factory. Same
with the turn signal flasher! Thanks again Matt !

That's funny, I just noticed recently that my 67 has started to do this
too! Havn't taken the time to diagnose, but it'll prolly be a corroded
wire or else, the only other thing will be corrosion on one of the relay
contacts inside the 9-prong sig-flasher box. My turn sigs work fine all
around, but on emergency mode, the left front doesn't flash.

Someday...
