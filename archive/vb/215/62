Subject: $133 round trip to Frankfurt!

OK, got your attention didn't I?

The same way my father in law did at 5:30am Pacific time this morning
telling me about the fares Northwest Air/KLM had to Frankfurt.  He'd
only caught the last part of the morning news story and did not hear of
dates or restrictions.

Well, after my frantic rush to the computer to try and track them down,
I found them.  Unfortunately they are only from March through sometime
in April.  How much for the middle of June you ask....well, only about
$1200 more :-(

But, if you'd like to go now, it sure is cheep.
