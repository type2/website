vin should be on a tag on the overhead vent and another on the seat
pedastal. also it should be stamped in the frame in the back.

Slam it, get some hydraulics and neon and send us all pictures.

> i live close to la and want to know where to get parts and rims for it.  it runs right now but runs real bad and its real slow.how do find out what year it is?

Your in the best place for it. check the phone book, magazines and ask
locals.
