Hi Tom,
Glad we could help!

That would be a good archive research item since we try to stick to pre-1964 
VWs.

195, 205, or 215, etc. is the width of the tire tread in mm.  The /65, 70 or 
75 is the sidewall hieght in percentage to the tire thread width.  In other 
word 235/75R15 is a tire with 235 wide tread, and sidewall hieght that is 75% 
or 176.25mm tall, R stands for radial, and 15 is the rim diameter where the 
tire seats.

> LT is what I want to side walls rated at!?!

Some LT (light truck) radials are softer and lower rated than some P 
(passenger) radials.  Thusly you have to inspect the sidewall rating of the 
tire to make sure it meets or surpasses the 1525 Lbs. factory minimum.

Only time and the right tires will tell!
