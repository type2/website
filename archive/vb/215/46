Subject: a Friday question..

Happy Friday!

Does anyone know of a 'Bus' Spotter's Guide that some one has put together
for a quickie reference?  I am fortunate enough here at work that it
overlooks the freeway and of course, I have my co-workers trained to look
for Buses as they motor down the road.  it would be so cool to be able to
'know' year models of all Type 2's.  

Thanks
