ya.  well, here's my story

65 westy, I got two mirrors on it (or it came with two mirrors when I got it, both old school elephant ears.

cold snap a few years ago, the drivers side one broke. 6* F.

I bought one of those new round mirrors and and matching arm, put it on the drivers side.  Boy, did that look cute.  thought of getting the match for the passenger side

Ended up taking the small round one off and putting another old school elephant ear on the drivers side, cause I wanted to see more.    The round ones do look better though.
