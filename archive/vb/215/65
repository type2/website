Hi,

I know this is odd, but it looks like an electric motor I inadvertently
designed while trying to make a perpetual motion machine.

I'd rather not be more specific but that is why it has all of the heavy-duty
electrical wiring and the semi-disributor still attached, as well as no
exhaust. The intake air is only for cooling.

Feel free to post this to the list (I'm not a member right now.)

Ontrees
