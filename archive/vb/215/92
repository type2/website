i got some questions about my new bus. i gots it last week from a junkyard in town.the homie at the yards says itsa 61 but im not sure. i looked by the windshield but cant find the vin number like my moms car.i wanna know how to lower it. i saw a sick bus yeasterday and man that bus was slammed!  i want to put some bags on it.

my bro down the street has a moter hes gonna sell to me.says its a 1640 and will work perfect. its alredy got all the crome metal and pipes.is this a bus motor?
