Subject: Mirrors

You ever sit around and look at your bus and wonder
things? I wonder why people go mad for the small round
mirrors and usually shy away from the elephant ear
style mirrors. They love the roofracks, side steps,
and safaris. But when it comes to mirrors they like
the basics, not the optional larger mirror. Maybe they
think it makes there bus look older? Of course I am
not talking about the early 50's busses, just the more
common 60's busses.
