Hi John,
SP will deliever more torque, while DP will result in more HP at much higher 
RPMs.  For a bus the SP and its resulting increased torque over DP is 
absolutely needed.  At least this seems to be the rule of thumb for engines 
up to at least 1776cc size.  For even more torque go with more stroke of the 
crankshaft and less bore.
