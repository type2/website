Subject: 4th gear grinding

I finally took the 65 out on a test spin after 2 years of playing 
around with it, and overall, things went O.K., except for a horrible 
grinding/spinning, rattling/refusal to go into 4th gear.  P.O said he 
thought tranny was solid, but hadn't driven it enough to really test it 
because brakes were so bad.

It feels like its in 4th with clutch down, but as I release the clutch, 
  all hell breaks loose, it grinds, screams and then jumps out into 
nuetral.  I've adjusted clutch ad nauseum, and moved the shift plate 
around up front  to establish what I thought was a really nice H 
pattern. I've checked and double checked all linkage and couplers, and 
everything's tight.   Reverse is very easy to find, and shifting is 
tight otherwise.   Tranny fluid is topped off to right below the filler 
hole.  1st, 2nd, and 3rd, were excellent and bus ran and stopped great. 
  Thus, I am getting nervous.

If tranny is shot, could everything else work so good, except one gear? 
  Anything else non-tranny related that I might have overlooked?

Very bittersweet day, as this was my first time ever out on the road 
driving a splitty, and I loved it, but if tranny is shot, I'll now 
suddenly have three "comotose" vehicles (two buses) in my possession, 
and something is going to have to go soon.
