  In todays world official VW graphs would be usless except for to see how
things were 30 plus years ago. How many people build BONE STOCK engines with
the compression ratios, carbs and cams as per original VW specs, not many
I'd say. I still have 2 OG virgin 1500 (never rebuilt), guess I could run
one of those on the dyno. 
  If you use brand new single port heads they have larger valves then
original 1500 or 1600 single port heads .
  1 thing I have found on dynoing an engine is the varience in HP and torque
that is done just by jetting and timing. On my 1800 stroker we got anther 10
hp and 20 ft lbs of torque after the final jetting and timing adjustments
and I thought it was running perfect and was happy with the numbers before
these changes.

ps. I WILL have some hard numbers on a 1776 single verses duel port in a
couple weeks

Hi Kevin,
Unfortunitly not!  Thus the reason we wish we could find official VW graphs 
of torque and HP output throughout the RPMs for SP and DP 1600s.
