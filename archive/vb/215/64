The Mexican DP VW heads come with long reach plugs, indicating thicker
castings.  I wonder if this might be aimed at reducing cracking.

One other place that cracks is the cylinder tin.  That can be brazed, but
the dual port tin tends to crack more than the SP tin, in my experience.

Still, since my bay came with DP, I'll stick with it.  I really doubt that
VW went to the all that trouble for a gimmick.
