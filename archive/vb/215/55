It has all the ear marks of a compressor. They probably keep it in the bug to
use the bell housing and starter motor. From the high current electrical part
it looks more like a Sterling cycle motor to charge something, maybe a bank of
batteries for electric drive? The distributor looks like a magneto or adapted
sling generator, I noticed that there is no fan belt nor anything for a fan
belt to drive. Definitely would like to hear the history on it, just for the
general interest.
