Subject: FW: Bad Camberg pre party

  For those going to Bad Camberg here is a message I just got from BBT

ronnie



A BIG hello to all VW friends around the world!

All and every VW lover is highly invited to BBT HQ for our Pre Bad Camberg
party, breakfast & convoy ( the last if You drive a old VW anyway!)

To check out details and register for this event plse use the link below...
there is also a direct link from our home page... we just want to have an
idea how many people are coming so we can do it the right way....

Pre Bad Camberg info & registration

Watch out... there is no connection between the convoy and the registration
for the show, being registered for one does not mean You are registered for
the other, in NO way....

Info on the Camberg show (and registration) You can find on the Bad Camberg
website, the link is on our Bad Camberg page...

Especially for our overseas friends.... You can attend the party (or
breakfast) without taking part of pelgrilmage, but you have to register for
this as well....

Keep the VW faith and see You all overhere!
