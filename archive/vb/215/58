Cracked DP heads in busses was a big problem. The reason was because the DP
1600 was designed for optimum performance pushing a certain weight, and that
was T1/T3, not T2 vehicles. That is the sole reason that the 1600 DP engine
was in only one year of American T2's. I say American, because they continued
to built for all foreign markets and Brazil still uses that same power plant
for a wide variety of vehicles.

The American market showed the flaw right away. We drive too much and demand
too much from our cars. The solution was ever present, but it meant a reduced
mileage and a modified performance curve. The 1600 off the shelf came with a
34 PICT carb with a 127.5 main jet and a 55 air. For the bug and thing that's
OK, power to weight ratio is good, but when you put it into a bus/truck you
are way too lean. Back in the early eighties I learned that just putting in a
135-137.5 main jet and keeping all of your rockers set to .006 with a .060
deck height gave the 1600 DP as much longevity in a T-2 as it would get in a
T1. I've been through a dozen sets of heads with 60 to 100K on them, depending
on the vehicle, and have only had one set of heads with cracks between the
valves. That engine was run too hard, too lean, and too many mountain camping
trips!

Richer and looser equals longevity. I still have plenty of power with my truck
hauling full loads up the hills I live on. I've hauled a full load of garbage
for two weeks and noticed only slight drops in fuel mileage.

I do the SP simply because DP heads crack.    Out of motors out of buses I've
pulled apart, about 90% of DP heads are cracked, and under 10% of SP heads.

Longetivity, vs a very small power difference.
