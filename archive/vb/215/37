Subject: Re: [VB] engine (Single Port vs. Dual Port)

I've been combing through my past articles in HotVW's, and VWT, but I cannot
find what I'm looking for.  I have been a long time single port fan, but I
believe it was HotVW's that did a dyno test with Single Port heads vs. Dual
Port heads, and the Dual Port out performed the Single Port in every
possible test.  This was even with "working" a set of single port to try and
get them to flow better.  If I find the article I will try to post the
findings.

Later
