Subject: Camper materials

I am currently restoring a 57 double door and am looking for either a
camper interior or interior building specifications (size, dimensions,
etc. on how to build my own acmper interior).  I live in Portland OR, so
if anyone has any materials, building specsm or knows how I could get
them, please let me know.  I am not interested in any post 67 camper
kits. 
Thanks so much,
Matt
