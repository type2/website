Subject: Please help!  Bus ad in Time 

I heard that there's an ad with a bus in it on the
inside back cover of Time magazine, and I think it's a
bus I used to own, sold to my girl friend at that
time, who rented it out for this hippie era photo
shoot.

Does anyone have a scanner and this Time magazine?  I
haven't been able to get the issue, and would like to
see the picture.  It's a 1965(?) bright yellow combi
(kombi) with flowers and hippy sayings put on it for
the shoot.  Thanks.
