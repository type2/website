Subject: Re: [VB] Friday: Bus sighting in a movie

Last night I saw a commercial on TV for a Playstation 2 game called "Dark Cloud 2" and 
in it you see a house, with car next to it, speed backward through time....the house 
eventually is disassembled, the tree next to it becomes a nut again....but if you watch the 
driveway there's a short period where you see a red/white bus in the driveway.  Very 
cool!
