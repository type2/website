Did you lap the cylinders into the heads when you installed them? If you did, you have burnt valves.
If not, you could try lapping them and trying again.

OTOH, I would go ahead and do a valve job and ring it while I had it apart. Cheap insurance.

So I checked and re-checked everything. All is good. Rockers assy's are on,
valves are adjusted, plugs are in and firing order is correct, everything else
was as before when running.
I get an idea to do a compression check (a friend also suggested this)
Here's the off the wall readings I get.
#1 85lbs
#2 50lbs.
#3 140lbs (seems high for #3 cylinder)
#4 70lbs.

#1 and 2 plugs are fouled out black and reaking of gas
#3 and 4 plugs are brand new looking.
