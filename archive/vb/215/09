Subject: Amanda was here (AIRS report)

For those who may have hosted Amanda, her dogs, and her 66 EZ recently -

She called here (Tallahassee) last night, said she'd got my name from the
AIRS list & was looking for a place to bunk tonight.  I was in mid-flu but
managed to hook her up with a member of the local VW scene who graciously
welcomed her into her home for this rainy night.  While we were working
out that arrangement the wife and I had a pleasant visit with her.

Very upbeat and spunky lady, doing her own search for the beginning of
the wind and seeming to be having a great time of it.  I'm envious.  Just
wish I hadn't been so sick & could've hoisted a few with her.

Bus people, man. <snif>

If you see her, give her my regards!
