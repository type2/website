I think he was using grease instead of oil - that probably didn't help.

I have never heard of those tap removers, I guess I will have to pop to the
engineering supplies store on Monday to see if they have some.  If not the
method of breaking it up will work - it is HSS and he managed to break off
portions of it trying to knock it round.
