I bet if you had towed the busses over to the OCTO meet, you could have 
made some good cash. I was told there was a guy doing that recently by 
visiting Oklahoma yards, chopping up what he found, and trailering back 
the stuff to Pomona.

Location, location, location.

Rich in Fresno sold a solid front floorboard for $300. I have almost 
paid $350 for two halves from Transporter Garden - and am still not 
convinced it isn't a good deal.

I paid $350 to a guy just to get some crappy sheet metal and 
bits/pieces - overpaid, but not if you add up all the parts like 12v 
wiper motor assembly, seat belts, steering wheel... My other option was 
$500 for a similarly rusted out (and completely gutted) bus in San 
Antonio. There is a gutted "Westfalia" South of San Antonio on The 
Samba for many, many thousands more - albeit in better shape.

Yes, you can find cheap busses - a guy in Del Rio told me that there 
are several yards South of him in Mexico, if you have the money/time to 
haul them back. But if you aren't anywhere close, or don't know where 
those places are (and can't drive around for months finding them), then 
you gotta pay what the going rate is in your area.

Granted the last time I sold my bus to myself, I got a really good 
deal. (Whenever my wife says, "You really need to sell the bus. I say, 
OK. I then go outside, talk to myself for 10 minutes - long enough to 
strike a deal, then walk inside and say, "OK, I sold the bus to some 
guy for $10.")
