Subject: Removing broken tap from chassis rail

My friend Jake has managed to snap a tap in the chassis rail on his bus.  He
was tapping it as the thread for the bolt holding on the beam was slightly
damaged, but as he was backing the tap out after the second pass it snapped
off.  He thinks the tap was slightly off centre as it snapped as he didn't
have much room.

The tap is broken off about 5mm deep into the rail and he has tried drilling
it from behind with small carbide drills with not much success.

Anyone got any ideas on how to remove it?  You can see down the four sides
of the tap - but there is only 1.5mm clearance and I can't think of anything
that we could put down each side to assist.  Any ideas???
