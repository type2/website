I recently rebuilt my DP engine top-end. The cylinders are 90.2's and
the new heads were hemi'd to match the old heads that were in there. I
wanted to keep the design that I've been running with. The old heads were
short-reach plug types 041, and since they weren't available anymore at
Rimco, I went with long-reach 044 heads. Hopefully they'll be resistant
to cracking between the valves. The 041 heads had cracks at the #3 and 4
positions.
We'll see how it goes - these are my first long-reach type heads.
