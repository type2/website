If VW thought in their infinite wisdom that DP were worse off than SP heads
they would have discontinued their use on production vehicles and went with a
modified SP that could produce the same HP. Problem is, the production SP
heads are as good as they get. The 30/31 carb set up on the SP vs the 34 carb
on the DP do not compare. Even when they tried dual 32's on the 66 T-3 SP they
got no more useable HP. The intake on a DP is larger and optimum for longevity
in its application. Speaking of application, they only tried it on the 71 T-2
and then went to the T-4 1700 because there wasn't enough power for the weight
with the geared up trans. Still worked good in T-1 and T-3 to 1979.

I took a trip up to Jake Raby's place a while back and he claims that a SP and
DP are the same thing
except for the split manifold at the head.

He says that if the tube going from the carb is the same diameter, why should
the split manifold on
a DP make any difference in the amount of air/gas delivered to the heads?

He said the DP heads are just a gimmick and that they aren't worth installing
because they crack
easier.

Just more *fuel* for the fire.

OK, Ya got me stumped on yer thinkin here. Identical stroke and bore with
more
air and fuel equals less torque? Couldn't prove that to me and my 67 SC. I
pulled the new SP out because I needed the pulling power with a load up the
hills. And with the larger oil cooler and wider fan, cooling shouldn't ever
be
a problem in normal applications.

Hi John,
SP will deliever more torque, while DP will result in more HP at much higher
RPMs.  For a bus the SP and its resulting increased torque over DP is
absolutely needed.  At least this seems to be the rule of thumb for engines
up to at least 1776cc size.  For even more torque go with more stroke of the
crankshaft and less bore.
