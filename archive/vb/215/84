Would fitting something like this onto a 1600 or a 1640/1641cc for a bus
be unwise?
Just curious to hear opinions.

I'd just run what you got.
Make money decisions when you have to if your engine isn't performing
well.
When it isn't up to quota make the changes then. I find that most parts
don't fail all at once (dropped valve seats the exception).
I've seen cracked heads that ran fine but I wouldn't reuse them because I
never knew if they were just starting or just finishing on the cracking.
If your engine runs good I wouldn't pull the heads I'd just run them.
The long discussion on DP vs SP heads hasn't impressed me much, seems
they are a matter of choice.
With higher compression you can expect your engine to run hotter so more
compression might not be what you need.
