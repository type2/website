Subject: Taillight wiring and Door Hinge replacement?

First: Anyone see a reason to add heavier gauge wring (say 14G) tot he
Taillights/Brakelights?  Think it would help brighten up the lights any and be
needed to use the LED Taillights/Brakelights?

Second: Anyone ever attempted to replace the Hinges on the front doors? My
dented door had great hinges and the one I bought has sloppy hinges.  I
drilled the Hinges off of the dented door.  Looks like you could use
countersink screws on two of the holes and weld the other.  Anyone done thins
before?

Dave
