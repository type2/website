The EMPI roof racks are great for the price, I now
sell them for 249.95 down 25 dollars from last year as
the price to me has gone down. PIP makes a great rack
also for 499.99. ...ronnie ...www.type2parts.com

Concerning the above message.  I own a double cab and
would love a rack for it.  I always thought the 2/3
rack is the one I should use and that I need different
feet for the double cab roof.  Is this correct?  Also
does anyone on the list think a 1/3 rack would look
good on a dubcab?  As I was writing this I thought
maybe a 1/3 one would be ready to bolt up easier.  I
would probably mount it as far back as possible. 
Anyone have pictures?
