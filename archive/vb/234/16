Subject: Re: [VB] headliner questions

Did you strech it as much as you could?

Sorry couldn't help myself, I'm actually halfway through a headlining job
myself, I have to finish around the lower windows.  I'm distracted right now
with other projects.  I think with the sunroof that my headlining job would be
significatly different from yours.  I bought mine from busdepot, and it fit just
fine so far, in fact I had way to much in the front.  However I used to much
glue and didn't know what I was doing so I might start over, but not for a
while.  Sorry I couldn't be of actual help.
