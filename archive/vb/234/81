three things

couple rabbit trucks, a 60 crew cab pretty rust free but had been wrecked on 
the drivers side.
and a 61 single cab with rabbit seats ply wood bed bottom cut wheel wells, 
and home made bumpers.  This auction was full of nice cars but, they all went 
for top dollar.
I should have written down the prices for the exact numbers, but these are 
the ones that i remember

       All vehicles with exception of the two pick ups and one sedan started 
up before they where sold. All vehicles sounded and looked great. all had 
been repainted had new or original interior,and where all from florida. 
approx. attendance was about 500 
people.  Lots of rare oem parts and accesories stacks of tires and wheels 
also tools and shop supplies where for sale too.  almost everything went for 
top dollar. 
no sleepers to be had at this auction.
