Subject: *The Bob Baker VW Car Show...SV-2's *

Just wanted to thank SV-2's and Bob Baker VW for putting on a great show
this weekend. Bob Baker graciously gave up a huge part of his parking lot to
host The great SV-2's Car Show. There were many, many beautiful buses, bugs,
Ghia's, things, type 3's etc. of all years and states of completion. SV-2's
put out a labor of love, and it showed.

Mike Visket, thanks for the 'Save The Bays' stickers.

Bill May, good to see you there, like me, drooling over all the beauties.

Thanks again for the great show!
