 Hi Don,
 You can check this info through the parts manuals on vintagebus.com.  You 
 need a 211 955 111 N which was a one year only wiper motor.  Would be 
 interesting to know if the 1966-67 wiper assembly could be fitted into there.

I heard you can put a 66/67 assembly in an earlier split if  you you mash, er 
'massage', the defroster vents tubes.
