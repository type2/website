Subject: Friday Rant .............. only my first for today.

As the current seller of two VW vehicles.

I'm getting a little ticked off when people start demanding that I lower
my price without ever have driven or had first hand view of my vehicles.
I looked at two VW Busses this week in my local area.
Both busses had dead engines and both had major problems ...............
this makes them salvage or parts busses in my mind.
I didn't insult either seller, I simply stated that I should be
considered a salvage buyer and if as a last resort they would rather see
the buy go to restoration than to a wrecking yard I'd be a last resort
buyer.
I know Texas is a dead zone for selling any type of VW Bus or Vanagon
because I've never sold any of eight or so VW Busses or Vanagons to a
Texas resident.
Who sets the value on VW Busses? 
It certainly can't be E bay.
