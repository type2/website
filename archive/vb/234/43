Just say No.  No works very well.

When I was selling my last VW, several people emailed messages like this:
"$3000, I will pick it up."

That's it - no name, no questions about the vehicle.

To the first message I responded:
"I would never sell anyone a car without talking to them on the phone and
making sure they know what they are getting."  The guy actually apologized
and ended up buying the car for the full asking price about 3 months later.
 He still never really asked any questions but at least I tried.  After
he agreed to buy the car and was making preparations to have it shipped,
he also said "Shipping is going to be about $700.  You are going to split
that with me, right?"   After I stopped laughing, I said "No."

To the other messages I simply replied:
"No."

Or say "Come see it with cash in your pocket and we will talk".
