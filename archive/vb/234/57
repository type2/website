For some quick info on what years (but not motors) these carbs were used
and how they differ, see http://www.type2.com/library/fuel/kuhn1.htm and
http://www.type2.com/library/fuel/kuhn2.htm.  As for that choke coil,
make sure you use the right voltage for your bus.  If its not marked on
the body you have to measure the resistance of the heating
element--around 5-6 ohms for 6v choke coil, 15-20 ohms for 12 volt.

There's also a helpful exploded diagram in PDF format at
http://www.kymcovw.com/Media/pdfs/solex_info.pdf so you can make sure
all your carb parts are there.
