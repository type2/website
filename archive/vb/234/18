Subject: Interesting camper config on auction site

Item number 2412427091 at that infamous auction site has interesting 
camper gear.  Looks like a home-do addition of westy suicide cabinet 
and bed, but check out the screens on the driver side popouts.  And it 
has a double outlet over the left rear taillight.

This bus looks so much like mine (mine came straighter), but IMNSHO 
*my* fakewestia interior is better. :)
