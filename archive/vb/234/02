Subject: RE: [VB] five speed

About ten years ago there was a raging battle going on between the 5-spd
conversion and the Freeway Flyer. When the 5-spd conversion came out in the
mid eighties, actually adding a Rabbit gear set for the high end, it was very
expensive and few could do it correctly. Now, 15 years later, it's down to
just a few shops that still offer it at a high price, and really only the
Beetle people want it. IMHO, go with the Freeway Flyer, cheaper and more
serviceable in a bus/truck.

Anybody have experience with G. Bergs five-sp conversion kit. Is this a
good way to increase hwy speed or did I just open Pandora"s box?
