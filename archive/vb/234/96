My SO of almost 25 years has humored me w/ the bus stuff the last 5 years or
so, but I have noticed that every time I bring another one home, she has
showed up at the same time w/ either a couple of dogs rescued from the
shelter or a new house we need to rescue, etc. Therefore I am at my present
limit w/ 3, although when she does look at new houses, she is always looking
for a place w/ lots of garage/shop space, places to store buses!  Not sure
what this means.

She has never gone to a show w/ moi yet, but loves to camp in the westy,
etc.  Her reply is "Tell me what's fun about  driving 1500 miles +- in 5
days to a show, stand in a parking lot talking about buses, drinking beer, &
not having a shower the whole time" - well excuse moi.

This weekend tho I believe we had a breakthru, when she asked what she could
do to help w/ the new wiring harness in the DC-She got stoked when we went
over to a friend's shop where he builds high performance motors, carbs, etc.
& watched him get a motor that had been sitting in a barn for 20-30 years,
running in no time! She thought that looked pretty easy! Knowing her, I bet
she could do it, while not wasting a lot of time trying to figure out the
best layout for the garage, where my 13 mm wrench is, making dinner for 8,
working 2 jobs, nurturing the kids, her girl friends,  & a bunch of old
folks, etc.

Praise Allah or whomever that gives us SO's who will let us indulge in our
little fetish as much as they do.
