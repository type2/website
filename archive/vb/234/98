Subject: Last Call for VW Buses n Boats Tshirts

Hey Y'all,
I am ordering the event tshirts for the Third AnnuAl
Buses, Boats, n Bands (Ohio) event TODAY! You can see
the design at the event web page which is found at
http://www.geocities.com/buses_n_boats
So, this is your LAST CHANCE to secure your tshirt, if
you have not yet already (grammar?) pre-ordered your
shirt, you must do so today. I will have very few
extras on hand at the show, and they are VERY cool
even if I must say so myself, so pre-order now. If you
pre-order the cost is $12 per shirt, if you wait til
the show, it will be $15 per shirt and I may not even
have any left over.
However, you do not have to be at the event to order a
tshirt, I can ship a tshirt anywhere for $3.95
priority mail.
If you have already pre-ordered, then "Thank you for
your support."

=====
Peace, John Baker
