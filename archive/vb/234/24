Subject: (blank) camper conversion.

I'm looking for info on the camper conversion the "Raffle Bus" had a few 
years back. I believe Kyle would be my best bet, but any others with 
info please, feel free to contact me.

Basically what I have is a friend that found '63ish Kombi that has the 
remains of that conversion in it. He was describing it to me and it 
sound familiar so i found some info I had in a book here and sent it to him.

Now he wants more.

Name, etc.........

Thanks,
Greg
