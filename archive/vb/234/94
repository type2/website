Subject: needle bearing crank?

A buddy of mine picked up 2 cranks with needle bearings for the rods this 
past weekend at a general car swap meet. The rods don't bolt on and the 
whole thing looks pretty beefy.

I found a picture on "the samba" of something that MIGHT be the same (going 
from memory). Was wondering if anyone could help identify.

The picture I found is here:

I'll try and get over there sometime and get pictures of his to be sure.

Any help appreciated.
