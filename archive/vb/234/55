Gary,

A bit late here, but I rejected powder coating for the window frames,
because if it chips, rust gets in, and you don't see it til it's really
too late. Regular paint and primer, properly done, with or without POR-15
assist, is far better. Get into ALL the creases and cracks!

Let us know how it works out!
