Subject: Re: My buses are going up for sale

 My wife and I do shows, campouts, poker runs, toy for tot runs, 400 miles,
  together ever since we got our first bus.  She has never complained about
  the quantity of VWs, had up to nine at once.  We now have four, two bugs
 and two buses.  Just last night at a street rod get-together we attended
  with her '67 bug, she said we should have kept the oval project bug we
sold  to a friend two years ago.
   No Liz does not actually work on the VWs as some other wives do but is
 just  glad to enjoy doing things with me with them!

 So, do you married people have a limit to owning busses, going to shows,
 swaps, et. al??  Be honest.  Eric and Barb and Philip and Kathryn are
 the exceptions that prove the rule.

 At his personal limit with 4 total, a shed full of crap and only one
 running!
