Subject: [VB] Gear oil

Don't want to start a GL4/5 flame war, but I have been using Amsoil 
synthetic 80-95 GL1-5 in my Unimog for three years, others have been using 
it longer, no ill effects, non-corrosive to yellow metals, makes tranny much 
quieter, smoother, cooler.  Expensive, but I think well worth it.

The Mog has brass syncros, and also has bronze bushings instead of bearings 
on the shafts, can be prone to failure with prolonged use at highway speeds, 
and is a real pain to change (weighs 750 lbs and you have to remove the body 
from the frame to get it out).  After putting Amsoil in it was like a new 
trans.  90 bucks for gear oil is cheap prevention.

All opinions in this post are strictly my own, and are not necessasarily the 
opinions of the family Treanor, Ladys Is Fire District, the State of South 
Carolina, or anyone even loosely affiliated with me, and I use the term 
loosely,well,...loosely.
