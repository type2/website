 Second: Anyone ever attempted to replace the Hinges on the front doors? My
 dented door had great hinges and the one I bought has sloppy hinges.  I
 drilled the Hinges off of the dented door.  Looks like you could use
 countersink screws on two of the holes and weld the other.  Anyone done thins
 before?

I have welded hinges back on.   VW sold replacement hinges, that you get to 
weld to the door.  The only problem is getting the angle and position just 
right.
