Hi Stan,
Best you park you bus in the driveway and practice with waving to kids in 
your neigborhood.  One can easily wave out the slider window without beating 
up themselfs or thier bus.  Otherwise waving with your shifting hand near the 
windscreen or sideglass will be very visable both due the outside daylight 
reflecting off your hand and that the glass is see through!  ;-)
