  Which raffle bus. There were 2 different campers. If you are talking about
the hatch top the was a dealer MOSAIC interior. I have the same in my 15
window and Kyle is making me the missing pieces.
  Somewhere on the net there is copies of the dealer brochures on these
interiors

I'm looking for info on the camper conversion the "Raffle Bus" had a few 
years back. I believe Kyle would be my best bet, but any others with 
info please, feel free to contact me.

Basically what I have is a friend that found '63ish Kombi that has the 
remains of that conversion in it. He was describing it to me and it 
sound familiar so i found some info I had in a book here and sent it to him.

Now he wants more.

Name, etc.........

Thanks,
Greg
