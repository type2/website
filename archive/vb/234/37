Subject: Cylinder head needed

I need a 2.0 liter Type 4 cylinder head, 
Does anyone have something? Recommendation?
 I have some that need welding, and seats put in,, But if you have one that
needs valves and springs , I would be interested.

The reason I cross posted this, I expect I will be in Mechanicsburg Ohio on
Saturday, I will be traveling from Cambridge On, to Detroit, then south to
Dayton.
I don't live near Toronto <wink>

So, If you have a cyl head,, a place for me to crash,, or stop for coffee,, or
want to meet at Mechanicsburg Ohio, get in touch

btw, here is what I am replacing
