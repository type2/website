Subject: Re: [VB] headliner questions

I remember finding in the Archives, and printing out, someones detailed
instructions on how they went about installing a new headliner.  Nicely
done, and when I get my courage up, I would not consider even starting
without reviewing that document.  See if you can find it, I think it might
help.
