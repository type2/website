Subject: RE: [VB] Part Suppliers

Don't know about CE, but Ronnie has always got back to me within 24 hours,
unless he's occupied with travel, and I'm a big PITA! :) I do find calling
suppliers about things I seriously want or need now the best option for
speedy service and questions answered.

Is it just me, or is it just very difficult to get replies to e-mails. I've
left Creative several messages about their Safari's as well as 3 to OldVolks
about the same, no replies. I guess business is too good!
