While what Mr. Berg said here is true, there is a hidden fact that he
doesn't mention.  While VW 4th gear ratios are overdrive (less than
1.0:1), VW axle ratios are quite high numerically.  Some bus axle ratios
are over 5:1 where a 4:1 is considered _really_ high for a
"conventional" vehicle.  The effect of the high axle ratio is to negate
the top gear "overdrive" to some extent.
