Subject: Re: [VB] headliner questions

how warm is it?  Perhaps a bit more heat would make the vinyl more stretchy

I remember someone saying get a bug headliner and practice installing it 
(like in a junkyard car) as they are cheap.  
Is what youre saying is that it's better to start from the front of the bus 
and work backwards?
