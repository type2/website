the problem with the LED taillight conversions is that they don't radiate
light in all directions.  this means that the reflector and lens doesn't
do their jobs and you end up with a really bright spot in the middle of
the lens.

I'm working on an LED taillight conversion that involves installing the
LEDs through the lens itself, focusing their light directly aft as is done
in the truck taillights.
