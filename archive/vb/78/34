Hey all,

 I'm looking for one or more of the odd looking pre heat tubes with 
the bracket attached.  They were original equipment on all later splits,
but 
most have been long discarded.  Here are some not too good pics of what I'm

looking for.  It attaches to the bottom exhaust stud on the #4 cyl.  It is
a 
tube about 1 inch in diameter and cut at a 90 degree angle on one end and 
the other end is cut at about a 45 or so.  The tube itself is bent at a 
right angle and has a small bracket welded to it.  The flex tube that comes

off of the air cleaner goes through the rear horizontal tin next to the 
crank pully and attatches to the part in question on a plane along the axis

of the bus itself....confused?? I'm sure Clara's not ;-)

If I find a better picture I'll post it, or maybe someone else out there
has 
a link to one???  Oh wait there is a pic but no description or part # I 
think in the parts manual on Thoms site. 

Here is the link to the pics I have and Thoms site

The one in the parts manual is straight, and the one I have is curved...I'd

take either one.  So all you anti stock exhaust folk out there or anyone 
else...please see if you have one or two.  I'd appreciate it!!! 

Thanks.
