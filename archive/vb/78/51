No, actually, as you can see, this did NOT come from the list.

This is an autoresponder (a very misconfigured autoresponder) at the
address of someone who used to be a subscriber of our list. It did not
come from the list, it was simply a reply to a message you sent to the
list (a correctly configured autoresponder would have a: not replied
because it saw the Precedence: bulk header, and b: if it still replied,
would have replied to the envelope sender, not the From: address so that
it would have returned to the listservers bounce collection program.


Please, if you have questions about these things DO NOT POST THEM TO THE
LIST, email an admin.
