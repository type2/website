Subject: Re: [VB] Electric fuel pump

buy a "912-FPMP" (worldpac part number).  it's a rotary fuel pump with
correct pressure for a carb. it's a stock replacement pump for a porsche
912 (i'm pretty sure). it's german made and lasts alot longer than a facet
pump. a bit pricy at around $70, but worth the non-hassles of it. put a
filter before it to stop crud from the fuel tank getting in it.
available at foreign aide, albuquerque  1-800-658-5712. maybe ronnie caries
them too. shops who order from worldpac can order them no problem.
