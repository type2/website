Hi Steve,
Actually the bent tube one is the later 1500cc engine one that attaches to 
the #2 cylinder exhaust stud.
  The 40HP and very early 1500cc one is straight and attaches to the #4 
cylinder exhaust stud.  This ealier model preheat pickup tube in the early 
1500cc engine compartment requires a hook shaped piece screwed in center of 
the rear engine tin.  This keeps the paper tube going from the left side 
around and away from the rear pulley on to the right side of the engine and 
to the 1500cc air cleaner.  
  So which one do you require, and if you already have the curved one and 
would take either one, do you not already have one?  
Confused in the PNW,  Eric&Barb
