Pictures of my EZ can be seen here courtesy of Everetts site.......

I should have been more clear (again) I was referring to Westy tents, not EZ or
otherwise. I have a EZ tent on the passengers side, and a Westy tent on the drivers
side. I will be putting a second Westy tent onto the Passengers side, and selling
the EZ tent.

What brought up my question is I'm going to put a rack on the back and I noticed
that the Westy tents have provisions for this. The Westy tent on my EZ now has the
provisions in the front (it's on the drivers side) so my question remains can I
find a RHD Westy tent to put on the drivers side and then put my LHD Westy tent on
the passengers side.

I know this is a little anal, but at least I'm not digging through boxes of
bolts................... 8-)
