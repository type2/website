Use real penetrating oil.  Kroil, liquid wrench, pb blaster, etc.

Use a hefty puller.  I use a Chevy pitman arm puller with a spacer to make
it a close fit.

Heat is your friend if you have a torch.  Propane may be somewhat helpful,
but a real welding torch is better.

Patience.  Leave the puller on it with tension applied and let time do the
work.
