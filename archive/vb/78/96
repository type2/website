Subject: Westy parts and stolen car

Hi all. Here are some links to some pics of some of the Westfalia parts I
had stolen along with Rachel's bug, Sunday 2/10/02. Please keep an eye out
for them at upcoming So-Cal shows. I can also provide a longer, more
detailed list and descriptions.
Thanks again for everyone's help and for the bandwidth.
