  The American flag Emblem are made by Alex of ISP West (aka pimppride). The
cost is relative to the labor involved in making them. There are 6 stages in
the painting of them. They are automotive quality. From what I've seen a
body shop will charge 50 to 75 dollars to prep and paint a emblem, so in
reality the flag ones are a bargin.

"He" was  selling one may be more for a $100, maybe someone else knows the
name.  BBB6 had one donated to the auction maybe someone there can also.
