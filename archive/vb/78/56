Subject: throttle cable cuts trans

My throttle cable is ever so slowly sawing through my transmission
case. I think I can stop it with a piece of rubber fuel line, but why
is this happening?
In my bus the throttle cable emerges from its tube beneath the bus at
about the same area as the nose of the trans, then runs exposed (and
touching the trans in one spot) until it enters the short tube running
through the forwardmost piece of engine tin and the fan shroud. Am I
missing any pieces here, some kind of bowden tube or something? Was
there a housing over the exposed cable?
Thanks
