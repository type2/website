Hi Jon,
Yup, that is it!  We found a modern availible protective tube with a slightly 
differant part number.  It was way shorter than 670mm, but we bought a couple 
anyway.  Tried to install it and turned out to be a bit too long.  Turned out 
the magic length was 607mm (Some translator must have been suffering from 
dyslexia that day.) and by carefully tugging/twisting the bell shaped end 
swedged piece off we were able to wire cutter off some of the length of the 
tubing and twist/push the end back on!  this length results in the clamp on 
the throttle arm of the carb to be exactly midway on the solid end of the 
accelerator cable.  This is important if you ever want to run the pre-1965 
accelerator return cable.
