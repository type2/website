Subject: Door Striker Plates needed

Does anyone know of a source for NEW door striker plates for a 1960 bus?
Mine are severely worn.

Also will the springs out of a oval window bug door handles fit in the
original door handle pulls?

Thanks
Charles (desperately trying to get my '60 panel on the road)
