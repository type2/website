Hi Joel,
You are welcome!  Forgot to mention the sheath accelerator cable protector 
was used as soon as tunnel case tranny was introduced in 1959.  Before this a 
bent box shaped wire was bolted on the forward end of the tranny and the 
cable went through that.  Would be nice to know if the later sheath cable 
protector will install in the earlier bus down to at least 1955.

Much like that, or more closely to the sheath of the reserve switch sheath 
used in all pre-1962 VWs, except in type 3.
