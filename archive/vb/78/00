If any one has mouse grey insert trim moulding, or knows of a source for
repop, please drop me a pmail...

For custom options, what about light rope inside, now that would be
interesting>?!

Thinking way ahead here...

I've got a deluxe bus that...at least right now...I'm planning on doing
mild custom resto. I'm not a real big fan of the deluxe trim. Other than

leaving it off, what custom touches have you seen done for deluxe trim.
Pictures would be great.
