Subject: RE: [VB] throttle cable cuts trans

ok, i catually measured mine last weekend, and it's 597mm (23.88inches) end
to end. the one end snugly fits onto the accelerator cable tube that's next
to the clutch cable tube, and the other end has a flared out end, similar
to the end of a trumpet, that fits over the metal tube that runs through
the fan shroud. parts book (on vintagebus.com) lists part number as
111-721-551 (shorten to 670mm), at least i think that is what it is
specifying by the description. i know there are different length bowden
tubes available for this application, but i think i found mine on busses in
junkyards. all i know is that the 597mm one works very well in my '59 with
a 1600 single port in it. it was also in my '61 with the same engine combo.
