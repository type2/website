Hi Elliot,
You can go three ways.
  One is to remove the outlet feed pipe and the filter sock.  Then take a 
screwdriver and push and cut a cone shaped hole through the fuel sludge.  
Then install a new filter sock, gaskets, and your old outlet pipe after you 
clear it out.  Running new fuel will disolve and allow the old gas to burn in 
the engine.
  Second way is to take the tank out.  Remove all parts off of it and take it 
to your local radiator shop to have it cleaned.
  Third is to get a 1968-71 gas tank and use Thom's proceedure on 
vintagebus.com to install it.  Resulting in a fifteen+ gallon tank instead of 
the stock 11ish.
