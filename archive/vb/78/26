How in the world could this be considered theivery????  I think the theif is 
the one who charges $100.  Of course he must have a willing victim.  

Is the image of the American flag copyrighted somewhere??  I think not.  Any 
individual should be able to paint a representation of the flag on his 
emblem, the side of his bus, his dash, whatever, as long as it is tastful and 
respectful to the flag.

These are simply my opinions, but I don't think I am alone in this.
