Hi Jay,
Most of the one year or perhaps considered two year parts is the wiper motor 
and 9 prong signal relay box.  In 1966 model year these parts were 6 volts.  
In 1967 model year they were 12 volt.  Both of these years of parts are 
completely differant from pre-1966 model year parts.  The wiper motors for 
these two years are getting hard to find so stock up a spare!  As for the 9 
prong signal relay box you can get a wiring kit to replace this with two 
easily availible relay boxes.
  Most everything else is 1964-67 parts.
