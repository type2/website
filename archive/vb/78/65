I am fighting this on my '60 as well. Different wiring, but same
problem. If anyone out there has advice for the earlier harness, please
don't be stingy!

Well, im in the  throws of rewiring my 65 double cab. Of course, just
like when I rewired my Ghia , the blinkers don't work. The DC has a
different relay set up than my ghia so Im lost. Could anyone tell me
what wires should have voltage all the time? Does anyone know how to
test the relay's?  I hit the T/S switch and nothing happens. I currently
have constant hot to on pole of the canister flasher and one pole of the
remote relay. Moving the T/S switch does not change where the voltage
goes. The wiring has been checked against the wiring diagram many times
so I don't think I have any wires on wrong. The only part of the diagram
that isn't clear is the emergency flasher switch. It has no numbers on
it so I hooked it up in a way that seems logical. Anyone have any tips?
TJ
