Subject: Article on Door rubber, and need more info

Hi all
I've posted a new article on how the factory installed the front door
rubber at http://dropgates.com/resto/doorrubber.html

Does anyone have any information on any of the other rubber spots, such as
engine lid, DC rear door, or truck belly door?
If so please pass it along, thanks. I dont quite have everything I need.
