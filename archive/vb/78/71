Hi Pete,
We run a 1641, CW, SP, with .89 fourth, 3.875R&P and 64-67 RGBs.  This 
results in 3,000 RPM at 58 MPH, which works great for us.  If your tranny is 
a bug on it should do 60 MPH at 3,000 RPM in fourth gear.  As for if it will 
work for you depends on how well your engine is, performs, and your 
expectations of acceleration and hill climbing.
