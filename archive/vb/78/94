I removed one from that location on my bus when I got it, it was
fuelling a pair of Weber 48's! But for a stocker carb I would be kinda
scared of an electric pump, it doesn't take much pressure to overcome
the needle valve in your carb float bowl, then you could have
dangerous gas leaks...
If you put on an electric pump you should make certain (like test it
yourself) that it doesn't put out any more pressure than the needle
valve can handle.
Why do you want an electric pump?

I was thinking about using an electric fuel pump in my bus.  I think
Cal
Grant had one in his '67 mounted to the left of the engine.  Anyone
else
mounted an electric pump in the engine compartment?  Or anywhere else?
