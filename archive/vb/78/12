Subject: OCTO Feb 2002 pictures

Got our few OCTO pictures up today.  Too much time visiting and not
enough taking pictures.

It was a good trip.  The wind was pretty bad on the way down the
mountain and back up but we made it.
Lots of swapping and checking out VWs.

Beto's stickers started showing up everywhere.  Nice job.

Low point was the theft of the beetle from the parking lot.  We were
able to get the information out fast.  There were 120 hits on the web
page yesterday and another 80 today.  So many hits we had to move the
web page to:
http://home.earthlink.net/~toyfield/stolenbug.html

Nice to know that so many people are willing to take the time to check
out the page just in case they should spot it.

Resting up and getting ready for another road trip
