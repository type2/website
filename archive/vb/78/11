I recently finished these knuckle guards for '64-'79 Buses

I also have my first set of Westy tent poles scheduled to be done next
week.
I was hoping to bring all of this to the OCTO meet but was unable to do
so. I'll have pictures of the poles when they are done. But right now
I'm trying to get an idea of how many people may be interested in a
them. They will run somewhere in the $500 range.
This is for a set of poles as seen on my '56 Panel here........
