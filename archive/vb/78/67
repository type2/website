Subject: Re: [VB] throttle cable cuts trans

Thanks for the help. I didn't think the fine volks at the old VW would
have left it exposed and rubbing.
So this housing (607mm long with flared rear end) for the throttle
cable, is it the same kind of material as say a bicycle brake cable
housing?
Also, I am using one of those cut-to-fit empi throttle cables, like to
replace with the proper one, you don't happen to know the correct
length, my bugshop is learning old bus along with me...
Thanks,
Joel and the '64 Sundial (oh that singleport intake / stock exhaust, I
just love the way that engine sounds!)

Hi Jon,
Yup, that is it!  We found a modern availible protective tube with a
slightly
differant part number.  It was way shorter than 670mm, but we bought a
couple
anyway.  Tried to install it and turned out to be a bit too long.
Turned out
the magic length was 607mm (Some translator must have been suffering
from
dyslexia that day.) and by carefully tugging/twisting the bell shaped
end
swedged piece off we were able to wire cutter off some of the length
of the
tubing and twist/push the end back on!  this length results in the
clamp on
the throttle arm of the carb to be exactly midway on the solid end of
the
accelerator cable.  This is important if you ever want to run the
pre-1965
accelerator return cable.
