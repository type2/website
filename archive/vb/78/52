Subject: questions about taller tires with IRS

Hi List,
I saw some posts in the archives about correct tires
on a bus. But I couldn't find anything dealing with
taller tires with an IRS.
I am currently raising my 63 crew cab to stock height
by using a stock beam I took from a 66 parts bus.When
I bought the crew cab, the previous owner had lowered
it by removing all the springs. It's currently running
195/50/15's on front and 195/60/15's on the rear. When
I get the stock beam back in, I plan on running
205/75/15's all around. In addition, the truck also
has been converted to IRS. The best I can tell, the
tranny is a 69 to 71 bug tranny. My question is this:
When I get the taller tires on, will this be too much
for a stock bug tranny with a stock 1600 dual port?
Will this be too much strain for the engine to turn
these taller tires??

Thanks everybody,

3DPete
