Subject: Octo parts list

Hi All,

While at octo this past weekend, I spoke with a number of people that
recognized me because I was rooting through boxes looking and asking for
small hardware pieces.... I figured I'd post it up to the list for all those
that said they might have stuff at home since most swappers don't bring
stuff like this...

I realize the trivialness of some of this but you've probably come to expect
it from me by now :-)

So, here's my list, print it out, find the parts in your stash and make some
extra green!

for the 59 double cab
- 5mm hex bolts (Kamax), wavy washers, and nuts for rear splash pans to
bumper bracket.
- 3, 4x10mm phillips dome head screws for rear pop out latch, latch to body.
These are a different screw as compared to most latches as it is not the
typical flat head screw.  The latches have black knobs and I believe are the
same for some barndoor years
- 5 to 10 old style band clamps or at least the cotter key and clasp pieces.
- (as many as you have) original wood slat bed screws.
- 2 wiper base hex bolts... secures the wiper base to the shaft.  Note here
that I have the correct older style bases that only have the round hole for
the shaft and NOT the bases that have the hole and notch.  The early style
bases use a smaller bolt (4mm instead of 5mm)
- Any nice usable interior panels especially head liner pieces.
- 1 or 2 can style/screw terminal flasher relays.  need not be in working
order.
- 5 to 10 phillips sheet metal screws for gas tank divider
- original mud flap brackets.
- 2 engine apron screws and washers (slot type, cheese head sheet metal
screw)... for use with the clip style speed nuts.
- original braided ground cable strap
- fuel tap cable end boot, cable clamp, and screw.  I don't need the part
welded to the chassis, just the clamp part and screw.
- 2, 4-59 date code Fictel and Sachs shocks... worn out ok.... I did find an
old set of boges at the show but I didn't buy them.
- any nice pieces of heater duct fabric
- original one eyed duck
- 211 711 167A sealing sleeve for transmission shift rod (goes under bus to
seal the long shift rod to the body)


for the 67 single cab
- velvet green over velvet green drivers side door.  Must be in good shape.
- drivers side door latch mechanism and latch post.
- front seat pedestal mat (covers the seat pedestal)
- 2 wiper shafts
- 12 volt horn
- 4 original hub caps (must have vw stamping on inside lip

... I'm also looking for a nice steering wheel badge for an early 58 ghia...
this is used with the metal horn button and not the later plastic horn
buttons.


Thanks for any help you can give.


David
