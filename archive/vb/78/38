If it is a 12 volt system, then many of the electrical items will have to 
come from a 67 because 66 was the last year for 6 volt and 68 saw bigger 
changes all around (alot of 1 year only electricals in a 67).  I had a 66 
that was converted to 12 volts and this made things such as wiper motors, 
turn signal switches, flasher relays, etc. very hard to find because they 
were one year only.

I think its WW that has replacment windings for the wiper motors to cure the 
6 v  to 12 v problem
easy to swap out
i saw it in the latest vw rag in one of there add's
