Subject: VW ads in 1963 newspaper

Hi,

  I apologize if this is a Friday topic...(not sure), but had to share this 
with the list.

 Today I acquired a newspaper dated November 22, 1963.   It is a full issue.  
This is the day that President Kennedy was shot.   Very interesting reading.
     Looking in the classified section, there are lots of VWs for sale.   
Even a 1/4 page ad from Behm Motors, Appleton, Wisconsin, advertising their 
new beetles for sale!!

    Some of the classifieds are:

     1958 Volkswagen, black, sun roof, radio, asking  $695.   call RE- 3 - 
6544

     1961 Deluxe Microbus, tu-tone paint, 9 passenger, real sharp, 4 speed, 
call RO-6-3581

     1962 Karmann Ghia coupe, ebony black, white walls, white top, radio, 
like new, asking  $1795.
     
     1963 Volkswagen sedan, executive car, low miles,  $1545.

     1961 Micro Station wagon, great in every respect,  $1395.

     And my favorite:


   1958 Volkswagen Micro Station Wagon, completely reconditioned,  $895   
Call RE-9-1126


     895 for a reconditioned 1958!!!!!


    There are many more listed in this paper too. Just thought I'd share my 
findings.....
