This can work, but you need a second hammer on the opposite side of the
fitting.  I use a short handled sledge for the stationary hammer and a
hefty ball-peen hammer for the striking hammer.  The axis you strike along
should be perpendicular to the axis of the taper pin.  _Never_ strike the
end of the tapered pin directly!
