Hi Joe,
Thanks for the heads up, on this good news.  We found them on thier internet 
catalog for $35.00 through the bug wiper motor section.  
http://www.wolfsburgwest.com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=113955811b
  Problem is the new armature is listed as only fiting some not all of the 
differant manufactures 1955-64 bus and 1958-66 bug wiper motors.  They list 
it as "Please verify brand of your wiper motor prior to ordering.".
  If someone orders one of these would they please list the makes of motors 
this works for?
  So the 1965-67 owners are still left out in the rain.  ;-(
