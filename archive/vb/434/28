I think that if Tom has a contract where he can pull out at any time  
paying only for work done, and stop by 3-4 days a month and work on  
his own bus. This may keep things honest? I've always done my own  
resto work and I know that it does suck up the hours. It is a blast  
rolling the completed project out for the first time!  Gary
