Subject: 64 Front Drums and Intro

It has been years since I was on the list and I miss the discourse
terribly.  I have recently become able to spend more time on my poor,
neglected, 64 Euro-Camper (AKA Weekender with submarine hatch) and need
some help.

My old front drums are shot and it appears (from the archives) that I can
put 68 drums on my late model 64 with some adapter seals.  Searching the
archives did not reveal a part number for the adapter seal that would
allow the late model drums to work on my old girl, so I was hoping for
some assistance in this area.

I am sorry if my long-term absence from the list has resulted in my asking
a question that has been answered before, but the archives and library
were not forthcoming.

To introduce myself and Sunshine (the 64 camper), I am an old gray-beard
EE and she is as described above.  Most of her paneling has been peeled
away by years of living in the redwood coast, but the cabinetry, including
the bed was stored away to prevent deterioriation.  I hope to spend some
effort to get the deer hit in the front fixed as well as cleaning up the
interior and getting the cancer remediated.  This is e-mail the first step
in what I expect will be a long, enjoyable process of rebirth for
Sunshine.

Thanks,
Terry
