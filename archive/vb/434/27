A year Tom??

That is a real, real, friggin long time for a "professional"
shop.  Unless you are getting a true great back burner/spare time $$ deal,
that would scare the shit out of me.  If you are getting, cheap good quality,
fair enough, but otherwise, wow...  Now if you are getting "well, it is in
line and I don't start on it until 4-5 months from now" that is OK I guess,
but otherwise, presuming this is a one horse shop, best be very careful.

I
would say your list is fine, but on a back burner time deal like this, you
damn well want to stop in at least every 3-4 weeks or so, and plan for crazy
possibilities like the guy folding and going out of business with your vehicle
trapped in his shop.  And I'd get a very detailed estimate, including roughly
projected dates for finishing major tasks, do no more than 25% down or so, and
clearly laid out increments of payment for the balance of the work, when
completed, in the projected manner, with at least 25% held for final
completion and inspection.

I'd also have concern about things like, stripped
body unprimed or even just regular non epoxy primed sitting out back under a
tarp rusting, etc, etc, etc.

I know a lot of shops that do give a big
financial break to back burner it, and do great work, old semi retired guys
for instance who work at home, but you got to be real, real, careful.  The
more you have laid out in paper, with a timeline, the better off you will be
if things go amiss.  Doesn't have to be a "contract" per se, but pretty much
amounts to the same.  Bodymen, even yokels, are used to pretty detailed
itemized estimates, cause on modern cars for the last 20 years you have just
looked it up in a book (now plugged into a computer) and each task has a
worktime, material cost for parts, finish, supplies, etc just spit on out.
 Here one has to use judgment (or a real old book 8-) for the time and tasks,
but a good guy should be able to do that, with very good detail, and come in
within 10-15% at most of what he estimated, time and material.

Some thoughts
anyway.  You should be able to build a bus from scratch in a year.

I'm about to send my bus off to the body shop. I've seen the work that the
shop has done, and the owner has gotten good feedback on thesamba, so I'm
feeling pretty comfortable going forward.

He's estimated that the work will
take up to a year, which I'm ok with (Pick any two: fast, cheap, or good
quality), but it's a commitment and I want to cover my bases going forward.
I'm thinking these are the steps I should be going through (in no particular
order):

1) verify he is insured/bonded
2) Get a work order/estimate (or is a
formal contract needed?)
3) pay a down payment
4) get regular updates?

Any
thoughts? I'm new to this...
