Subject: RE: 64 Front Drums

I asked about fitting late model drums to my 64 bus.  My old drums were
turned too many times by the PO, so now, the walls are thinner than spec
and I can't adjust out enough to get grab without seepage from my
cylinders.  It is not the cylinders fault, they are new (several times),
just over-extended.

Thank you veewee111, I will look into bearing supply houses.  I thought
there might be a standard part that I could order from a VW supply house
to make sure I was doing something standard.

Thanks,
