Subject: Roys 21 window debuted, see youtube video...

Hi all,

Enjoy this 10 minute video I just shot and edited showing a local VW buddy
getting his freshly painted and restored 1965 VW 21-window Deluxe Sunroof
Microbuson the road again after receiving the painted shell just 23 day
earlier!!!  An amazing effort by Roy and some of his good friends!  No
"cutting any corners" on this one either, top-notch stuff and restoration
process.  It's got a 2110 cc powerplant.  Check it out here:

and feel free to add comments about Roys new Splitty.  We're all pretty
excited around here for Roy, he really deserved this!  Not completely
finished, but we just had to take it out once it was safe and road-worthy!
Enjoy the ride (and the video)!!!
