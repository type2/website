Subject: Re: [VB] RE:Hard Shifting

Sta- Lube GL-4.
white container with a teal label.  not everywhere carries it.
honestly, they still rebuild VW trannies, but it is a hassle to swap it out.

Best just to keep the tranny topped up.

Buy the gallon size, it takes about 3 qts.

being low on gear oil will cause the shifting to be bad,
same with the shift linkage being dry instead of greased.

is it leaking the gear oil somewhere?
 axle boots cracked or torn?
axle seals dry,
 or gear oil under the brake drums?

Was writ "Change the gear oil a thousand miles from now, and then go to
30,000 mile intervals."



Yeah I had planned on running it a bit, and then replacing the fluid in
about a month. I was going to search the archives for info on transmission
fluid, as I know there has been a lot of talk about what the best fluid is.
But now that the subject is up again, I'm sure fluids have changed over the
years.what is the current consensus on transmission fluid?
