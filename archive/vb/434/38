Subject: Re: [VB] 15" Tires

205/75/15 Size is still pretty available (well that means 4-5 choices, non
inclusive of trailer tires, which in today's world ain't bad for a 14 or 15"
tire) however something with a LR over 100 is getting hard to find.  I
recently bought 4 on rims to use on my trailer, which runs this size, then had
one irreparably punctured.  They were a like new set of 10 year old General's
off an old Dodge D50, and had 102 LR but I found that aside for the C loader
true trailer tires (which did not match my tread well) I could only find LT
tires with 97 LR.  Most choices do have max inflations of 44 psi, but the 97
LR only gets you about 1600 lb/tire.  Which may be fine or not depending on
your POV on such things.

205/70R15 exists as well, but even less LR at 96 for
most choices, and no cheaper.  Lucky folks in Europe can still get several
195(80)R15 choices with loads up around 2000lb/tire.  Not us of course.

Bus 15"rims  (4 big rectangular slots) are IIRC 4.5" wide, the bug ones are 4"
wide
I have run 205 75 15 tires on bus 15" rims, many miles, no problemo.
many
others have too.   Have not bought any for a few years, so no comment on
current availability.
