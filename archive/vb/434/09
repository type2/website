Subject: List Split Announcement [IMPORTANT]
Dear List Members, Due to the incredible traffic on this list and the  
fact that many people have signed off because of the volume, and the  
time it takes to run it, I've accepted an offer by Ken Hooper (bighouse(-at-)socomm.net 
) to host an Aircooled Bus list.

I've really enjoyed the nature of this list and I hate to see it split  
in some ways, but I'll still be *on* the AirCooled list, I just won't  
be running it. I believe that this will be the best good for the most  
people.

The plan is to split the list based on Joel's stats. AirrCooled bus  
owners will end up on the new list (called type2(-at-)primenet.com),  
Watercooled owners will stay on the Vanagon list. If you have both,  
you'll be on both. If you are a WannaBus or Sniveling Unknown Lurker,  
then you will stay on the Vanagon list. This transformation will  
happen sometime in the next couple of days. We will be sharing more  
details soon.

Please show Ken the respect and appreciation you have all shown me.

Thanks! -- Gerry Gerald Skerbitz <gsker(-at-)med.umn.edu> U of MN Med

Listees,

Ah, but we're pushing 1100 subscribers and I'm getting jaded and mean  
and worn out, you knew it had to happen eventually. I believe I will  
retire from the pursuit of list administration, buy a clutch of goats,  
move to the Dominican Republic and live in a hut made of leaves and  
sticks. That sounds pretty good. 8)

Here is what is going to happen:

-- We are going to split the type2 list. Please don't freak out, we've  
split before and we will again and this is the way of it as the net  
grows. There will be one list for split-windshield people and another  
for single-windshield people.

-- This list, type2, will become the bay-window list. It will be  
administrated by Steve Dolan <dworkin(-at-)type2.com>.

-- The splitty list will be called vintagebus and will be  
administrated by Thom Fitzpatrick <thom(-at-)calweb.com>.

-- In the previous list split and in previous server changes, we have  
subscribed you from old list to the new one without any action on your  
part. Please note that we are NOT GOING TO DO THAT this time. You will  
be given subscribe instructions for both lists and you will then have  
to subscribe yourself to the list(s) you want. This is because we  
think we are carrying lots of people who aren't really reading the  
list and this will cut that dead weight out. We'd like to cut the  
server load if we can, it is serious bandwidth.

-- On Sunday night we will erase the roster; on Monday when you log  
in, get on the list(s) you want and just continue on. The automated  
subscription process takes two minutes maximum.

-- Both lists will be running out of type2.com, through the gracious  
generosity of Duelist <duelist(-at-)azaccess.com>            and Arizona  
Access, without whom I don't think we could survive.

-- I understand that some folks will need to vent, Heaven knows they  
did last time. 8) You can pretty much say what you want, just please  
put "list split" somewhere in your subject line so people can delete  
if they want.

-- I said once that this is the best group of people I have ever  
worked with, on-line or otherwise, and despite the idiot-mail and a  
few juicy flames that is more true now than when I said it (because a  
thick skin enables you to discern the important). I remain honored to  
have worked with you. I've been on the net a *long* time and been in a  
lot of fora and there was never anything else like this that I saw.
