Well I am just saying that it would be a very rainy day in hell when 
I would leave a precious beloved old car with a person for a year. 
and this is something I say based on having met wonderful, charming, 
cuddly and trustworthy people who TOTALLY SCREWED UP.

And whereas I have restored a five story brownstone using husband and 
the occasional helper, plumber, mandatory electrician  to meet a code 
requirement calling for a blessing by a licensed electrician who did 
no work, and so forth, a year seems like GETTING MARRIED more than 
like having a car restored. Say, you might be getting the deal of the 
century, but it sounds more like somebody working in spare time and 
not with the full time focus of a legitimate worker. I would not want 
to be worked on in spare time while insurance cases are taken care of 
first. I would want my car to be the top priority.

If you have never experienced the joy of getting back your car, 
unfinished, and in many trips each one with parts in boxes, some of 
which never materialized, you might not be  writing as I did. And 
this was going to be a special DEAL while the worker took care of 
other cars and meanwhile devoted his true artist self to my car.

PS We have so far restored five houses, have always bought fixer 
uppers and really did finish them in our spare time since we had to 
WORK at making a living and  they did not take a whole year. I mean, 
if we elected to do MORE STUFF on them, one did take a year and a 
half, but that included building a 2,000 square foot two storey 
greenhouse on the property as well as fixing up the house.
