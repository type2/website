Subject: Re: [VB] 64 Front Drums and Intro

Hey Terry,
Welcome back to the list. Nice to hear about another 64 camper owned 
by another EE. My bus is a double door delivery with a Kamper Kit 
interior. I don't know the answer to your question. E&B or Clara may 
know this one.

Cheers!
Chris
64 DD Kamper
