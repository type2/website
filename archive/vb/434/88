Subject: BNNTA #27 update...

Hi all,

The first arrivals for the BNNTA were at the Lake "main" campground on Monday
afternoon, a new "early" arrival record!  More have joined them this evening,
and we will arrive in the "group" campground on Friday morning.  We will
almost certainly see rain for part of the weekend as the remnant of storm
Isaac moves through the area.  No big deal, we've had rain before.  And with
the right amount of bar-b-que and beverages under our E-Z-ups and umbrellas,
it too shall pass.

The Rangers already have the gates to the "group" campground opened up for
arrivals.  We are looking forward to seeing everyone soon!  Please have a fun
and safe drive to visit and camp with us at BNNTA!

Bill
