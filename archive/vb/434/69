Subject: type2.com server moving to new location

It's that time again. As we go through changes, so too must the type2.com
server. It's enjoyed prosperous uptime in FasterLaster's basement, and it's
due to be shipped to our new location in AZ.

Thank you Jason!

Don't worry, it will still be stuck in a lowly dark place :) The server will
be going offline tonight, and I suspect it will be back online in just a few
days. We may get a secondary queue in place to grab emails sent while it's
offline, but that has not been finalized at this point. The type2archive.com
server will also be offline during all of this.

Email directly for any questions. troy(-at-)wical.com

Apologies for the short notice, and thank you for your patience!

Peace,
