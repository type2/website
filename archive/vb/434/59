I have 205/65 and 205/70 (this was not intentional, I ordered one size and
got two pair of different sizes) and they rub on the rear fender wells.  I
needed to put a minor "custom flair" for them to fit.  The tire shop put
the /65's on the back to keep them from rubbing, but I found the /70's in
the back actually worked better in that regard.

I am running these wheels from CIP1 and Vredstein tires from Bus Depot

I guess it is an "offset" issue.
