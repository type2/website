Hi Volks,
Production of the big nut transaxle did not start till early in 1964
production.  1964 production started in the beginning of Aug and the new big
nut and 1500 cc engine came out 1OCT64 as standard equipment.  Before this the
1 ton axles, brakes, and 1500 cc engine would be listed as M code 215.
