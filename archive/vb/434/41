Subject: Re: A YEAR?

A person could make a Rolex watch out of pig iron in a year. I would 
NEVER sign onto a deal like this in a bazillion years. People have 
forgotten what these things looked like when they rolled off the 
assembly line. They had some orange peel paint, and the occasional 
DING even. the standards produced by custom restoration have produced 
a PHANTOM BUS which never existed when they were brand knew. zillions 
of layers of hand rubbed paint and all that stuff. People, this is 
not what ORIGINAL looked like.

people build whole houses in less than a year.
