Subject: Re: [VB] Re: A YEAR?

I left our 56 westy to get rust and dent repair done November 2009, expecting
to pick it up a year later in November 2010.  This was not a total resto, just
metal replacement.   It waited months for the current project to be done.
Then another somehow slipped in front.    So it sat and waited its turn.
Sometimes he had other things to do, like taking care of family, or
maintainance on his daily driver.   It was not done November 2010.     The
work I wanted was completed the following summer, and he stored it till we
could pick it up the next November, which was 2011.

Yes,  it was two years.

 But the work it self did not take two years.

In some ways the timing was good, as it was easier on the payments, and I had
to find and ship a bunch of metal.    Greg wanted to find og metal pieces,
which is harder than orderiong new from the usual vendors..  And it takes more
time to dissect og chunks of bus to make them ready to weld on.

Overall, I am very happy.  YMMV

I have heard plenty of horror stories of people going out of business and
taking people's deposits, and leaving them with a taken apart bus.

building a new house is entirely not the same as rebuilding an old house,
though.  just saying.
