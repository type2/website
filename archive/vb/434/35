Digital cameras are rather common these days. The shop should have one 
available. Phone cameras are convenient, however a camera usually has 
better lens and thus better photos. Ask them to use a camera, you 
could even supply one. $150-200 or so buys a fairly decent one these 
days and there is always ebay. You would be happy.
