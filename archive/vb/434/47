As long mentioned though, just getting a 1525 lb weight rating (and as I stated most LT tires in this size will have a 97 LR good for around 1625 lb) you are of course still not getting a reinforced sidewall and handling may suffer, even though they are weight rated.

I'd do it without a second thought but that is me, strictly YMMV on this one.

Make sure what ever tire you use has at least a 1525 Lbs. weight rating.
