Subject: Accel cable.

Sorry Type2's
My 64 DD Kamper Kit is still running the factory accelerator cable. I 
did try to install a new one once upon a time but it got stuck a few 
feet into the tube. I was lucky enough to be able to pull it back with 
the wire I had attached. The problem here is that with the double 
doors, there is a belly pan and the the tube is not accessable. When I 
had the bus restored in 03, the mechanic didn't want to mess with it.

Anyone have words of wisdom for the day I really need a new cable?
And its a low mileage bus, only 316,000.

TIA
Chris
