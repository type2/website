I use synthetic gear oil. You will be shocked by the price, but I think 
it's worth it. After all, how many VW transmissions are being made these 
days. We'd better preserve what we have.

Synthetic gear oils don't achieve their GL 5 rating through the use of 
sulfur compounds, so you don't have to avoid GL 5 oils. That's true at 
least for Royal Purple.
