Tom,

Make sure your work order has a lot of details so that there are no
misunderstandings later when you pick up your bus. A reliable well
spoken of shop is important too. They have a rep to uphold. Drop by
often to look at the progress. Ask the shop to take pictures and email
them to you also. Nice to see all the steps later on. Best of luck.
