I would look at the shift coupler from the trans shaft.
the spot weld can
break and look ok at first...
Have someone shift Bus as you crawl under with
flash light
and look super close at the metal collar with the square head
bolt
to make sure they move at the same time (Solid) or not (Broken ...replace)
The
clutch cable stretching before failure will make a difference in pedal feel.
Good Luck
Tony

Is the shift plate, the piece at the
bottom of the shit rod, where the shift
rod goes through the floor. I remember
replacing that on my '65 as well. It
was so long ago-I don't remember what
exactly prompted it. I also don't
recall how to adjust it.

As for the clutch
cable...how do I know if it has gone bad? Last time one
went bad, I remember
pushing the pedal felt really different. It seems like
pushing the clutch
pedal feels the same it always has.
