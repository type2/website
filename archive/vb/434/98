Subject: RE: Hard Shifting continues...

Not sure if you all remember, but my shifting became really hard a few
months ago. I checked the clutch cable that seems fine, the trans fluid was
too low, I drained and refilled that. I also took apart the base of the
shifter, and saw no grease there. I lubed that up.

 

I then adjusted the plate at the bottom. It shifted nicely for a bit, then
became hard to shift again-so I adjusted the shift plate again-this pattern
repeated itself numerous times, I adjust the plate, it works well for a
while, then gets harder and harder to shift.until I adjust the plate again.

 

Any thoughts on this?
