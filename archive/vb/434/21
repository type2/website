Volks,

I'm about to send my bus off to the body shop. I've seen the work that  
the shop has done, and the owner has gotten good feedback on thesamba,  
so I'm feeling pretty comfortable going forward.

He's estimated that the work will take up to a year, which I'm ok with  
(Pick any two: fast, cheap, or good quality), but it's a commitment  
and I want to cover my bases going forward.

I'm thinking these are the steps I should be going through (in no  
particular order):

1) verify he is insured/bonded
2) Get a work order/estimate (or is a formal contract needed?)
3) pay a down payment
4) get regular updates?

Any thoughts? I'm new to this...

Cheers,
    Tom
