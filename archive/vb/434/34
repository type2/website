Chris has a good point, which has another great utility.  That is it will help
you very much if you need to sell the bus later on to have pictures taken of
all major steps along the way (presuming they are done well.)  I'd go so far
as to pop for a AA powered cheapo (older or cheap) say $100 digital camera and
leave it with the guy with your name on it and a pack of AA batteries.
 Assuming he does good work, having those in process pics (and you can snap 10
each time you visit as well) can really make the money back at sales time if
it comes.

Tom if he truly feels a couple of months, sounds a lot more
reasonable.

spoken of shop is important too. They have a rep to
uphold. Drop by
often to look at the progress. Ask the shop to take pictures
and email
them to you also. Nice to see all the steps later on. Best of luck.
