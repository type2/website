bus 15" wheels are 4.5" width - and should be fine with a wider tire. 
stock was a 15x6.40, but a 205 (~8") works fine.  (short of those who've 
chased down bias plies or radial skinnys or low profiles, I think everyone 
I've seen pretty much just runs 205s on 15s)

I run 27x8.5" on my 14" wheels (which iirc are 5" width).   There's a 
thread on Everett's site about big tires on stock wheels. ;)

For a bus - if it will fit in the wheel well, it'll be fine on a stock 
wheel IMO/IME.

...david (who otherwise -can- be picky about wheel/tire width 
combinations.  but there's plenty of room for exceptions, too.  keep your 
cornering speeds under 100mph and you should be fine! ;p )
