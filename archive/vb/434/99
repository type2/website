Subject: License plates

Hi Volks,
Since it is Friday thought to post this.  Been wanting to put up license
plates from all over N. America and beyond in our shop.  So got any old spare
junk plates from your area??
  We have lots of Washington State license plates (with Mt Rainer in the
background or some of the the older white and green) to trade or for harder to
get location or older plates will pay for shipping and some $ if you are not
interested in trades.
E&B
