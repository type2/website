Lots of great bussing memories.
And for anyone still around from those days, I still have a few of the 2nd
generation list stickers I printed up back then, right after the first
split, but right before the second. These have the type2.com address and
are also the last ones with the vanagon(-at-)lenti address...free to anyone who
was around back then and knows what they are, just shoot me an email...
