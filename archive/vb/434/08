Ok now we're going back a ways... ;)

I'm pretty sure that Steve was on vanagon(-at-)lenti (the -original- 
type2-of-all-years) list.   Ken forked type2.com for we the airsuckers in 
early 97.   The list bounced around a bit between bestlist (I think..) as 
a commercial mailing list provider, and azaccess (thanks Marc!), until 
hosting moved pretty much permanently to Atlasta (which is when I took 
over the server side of it).

When Ken retired (a real rough guess would put that somewhere between '01 
and '03?) - Steve was already actively involved with the list, as I recall 
part of the admin crew helping to moderate and keep the anti nazi death 
threads (sic) under control.  Steve stepped up to take over financial and 
overall administrative leadership.  (we had an irc server back in those 
days... ;)   The list moved around a few times (lived under my desk in 
Savannah for a while, at Steve's house for a while, before finally 
shipping off to Seattle for the long haul.

Eventually Steve tried to retire and I sorta continued to keep things 
together for a few more years... ;)


And dinner is ready!  I could probably dig up a bunch of email and track 
down a better history.   Though most of my email from before ~~96-97 is 
long gone thanks to the guy who hacked tallahasee freenet....
