Subject: 15" Tires

So a couple of years ago I bought some 15" rims from Clara with the  
intent to achieve lower RPMs through "rubber gearing".

However, i never ended up getting any tires put on them because I  
couldn't find any tires that met the narrow rim requirement of the  
splitty rims (which are what, 4")?  All the 15" tires I found had a  
rim width spec of >5" or 5.5" IIRC.

Any thoughts on this apparent mismatch and whether it's safe to go  
with the wider-rim tire on splitty rims?

I'm going to replace my tranny, so I could also go with the Freeway  
flier, but I thought I'd inquire as to your experiences.

Cheers,
    Tom
