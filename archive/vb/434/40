Subject: Re: [VB] 15" Tires

I have 205/75/15 tyres in my 63 single cab. I also have a 3.88 ring and pinion with the 63/one year only one ton option, of Little big nuts.
The net result is that I am doing 3000 RPM at 60 MPH.
I have a 1600 DP with type 3 twin Solex 32 mm carbs, and a bug pack header.
It is great for cruising the Freeway, but I do downshift a bit more often than I like. But it is a sweet setup.
