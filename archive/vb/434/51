Chris (and Gary),

I was under the impression that some of the 1967 buses had a 4.375:1 R&P:

(from http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/manuals/manuals67.php)

The last time I used a tach on my bus seemed to bear out that mine was 
one of these...  To wit: I'm hitting about 3,000 rpm at 50 mph with 
195r14's and the stock 1.25 reduction boxes.  (IIRC)

So, I believe the 4.12:1 would be an improvement, although I could be 
mistaken.

Cheers,
    Tom
