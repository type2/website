All,

If anyone is interested in purchasing Steve Dolan's '69 or '73 bus, his 
brother is ready to sell them.  There are pictures of them here:

He's basically looking at it along the lines of a silent auction.  The 
only rub is that it would need to be gone no later than Aug 3rd, and 
this weekend would be preferred.  The buses are located in Alexandria, 
VA, USA.

You can email him at jimtd83(-at-)gmail.com.

As far as I know the '69 runs and the '73 has intermittent FI-related 
problems.

Cheers,
    Tom
