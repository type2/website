Subject: Steering damper bushing

I was under my bus a few weeks ago, and noticed the bushing at the end of
the steering camper appears to be worn. I was going to replace it, and when
I looked at the Bentley for the procedure, it looks like you need a
specialty tool to install it. Is this truly the case, or can you get by with
just a bench top clamp?
