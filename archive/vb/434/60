Subject: Body Shop for restoration, west coast?

Speaking of body shops, I'm looking for one.

I could use either a body shop, or a full VW restoration shop on the 
US west coast. This is for Dad's 1965 transporter that he made into a 
camper. When he passed on last year doing the restoration for our 
family became my responsibility.

I can prepare it for the dip tank if needed if it's just getting body 
work, but with my project load a shop that handled the whole 
restoration (less the drivetrain) might be best. It's not in bad 
shape, but does need a few panels fixed/replaced from unfixed 
accidents over the last 300K miles plus some misguided mechanic cut 
out the louvers years ago.

I've seen a lot of paint jobs that look great from 20 feet but closer 
up you can see the bondo scratches or the wavy panels, for this 
project I'm looking for better than that. No hand rubbed lacquer 
needed, but looking like it left the factory last month would be 
ideal.

I'm not in a big hurry, it's been sitting in my garage for over a 
year now. I can afford to start anytime. I'm in Oregon and could 
bring it somewhere within a couple days drive once I fix the front 
brakes.

If anyone has suggestions for a great reliable shop I'd love to hear them.

Thanks,
