Subject: AridZona Emissions

At the current time, emissions testing is required for model years 1967 thru
2002. According to our Legislative Liaison, there are teams working on the
implementation of HB 2357. However, there is no anticipated implementation
date at this time. (I have received a number of emails in which vehicle
owners indicate March 1 as the implementation date but our Legislative
Liaison seriously doubted that the implementation would be complete by this
date.) We will not post it on our web site (http://www.azdot.gov/mvd,
General Information, "What's New") until it is implemented. However, you may
be able to obtain information about this subject now on the web site for the
Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (as they are the lead agency on
this bill) (-at-) http://www.azdeq.gov.

 

If you will not be driving this vehicle for a while, you do not need to
renew the registration prior to the expiration date. You can wait and submit
a non-use affidavit w/the renewal notice and registration fees to waive the
late registration penalties which will accrue. A current registration is not
required by the State of Arizona for a vehicle that is not being driven on
public roadways. 

 

If you have to renew before the House Bill is implemented, you can apply for
a three-day permit to legally drive the vehicle w/the expired registration
for emissions testing. You may obtain this permit online (-at-)
http://www.servicearizona.com using a printer and major credit card. The
permit fee is $1. The permit allows you to submit a non-use affidavit even
though you drove the vehicle for emissions testing. Thank you.
