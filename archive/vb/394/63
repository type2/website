Subject: Re: [VB] VW Minivan.  was VW trademark ? 

What Conrad didn't mention was that the new van coming is nothing more than
a rebadged Chrysler minivan.  When I first heard that VW was discussing this
I asked one of the area VW reps.  He said that it would just be a Chrysler
frame with VW body panels and running gear.  I felt pretty nuetral about it.
Then I went to a parts manager's meeting and they told us that it's
completely theirs.  Now I'm disgusted.

I know what I expected, which is probably close to what all you guys
expected.  But VW plans to sell less than 40,000 vans here, so production on
that scale is just not feasible.  Too bad too, 'cuz I was ready to sell
every new VW I have to get a new Microbus.  Better yet, the crew cab
version!

Oh well.  All that did was increase the value of our splitties!
