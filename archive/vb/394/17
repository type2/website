See sketch at http://www.type2.com/~mroberds/fuel-line-routing.png .
The metal line doesn't directly connect to the pump - a short piece
of rubber hose is used for this connection.  The "famous" grommet you
already know about; in the past it's been discussed that there is also
supposed to be a padded clamp that holds the fuel line to the left side
of the fan housing, using the shrouding screw on the fan housing.

The fuel line from the pump to the carb is not in that sketch.
I don't know if the line is different for a doghouse.

I hope this helps!
