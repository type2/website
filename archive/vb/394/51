Subject: switch

need advice, the switch has always worked fine, but one day all it would do is make a click when I tryed to start. It did this several times, so I gave up. A few dayes later it worked fine. Still is working. Do I need to replace it. I would hate to go somewhere, and it not start again. thanks, Bob
