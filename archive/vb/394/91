Subject: Resolved: Re: [T2] Clutch Pedal Doesn't Return

Survey Sez:  "Corroded Clutch Pedal Axis!"

I disconnected the clutch cable from the pedal and found that there  
was still heaps
of resistance to moving the pedal.  I then proceeded to disconnect  
the clutch pedal
from the clutch pivot arm, then pulled the pivot arm.  Lots and lots  
of corrosion, gunk,
and the remnants of what was probably grease 40 years ago.

I cleaned the boring (?) with carb cleaner and multiple paper towels  
until the paper
towels started coming out clean (well, mostly), then cleaned the  
shaft in the same
fashion.  Sprayed it all down with silicon spray (thought about using  
moly multipurpose
grease, but didn't have it in front of me), worked the shaft through  
the boring a bit,
sprayed it down again, then reassembled, reconnected the clutch cable  
to the tranny,
adjusted her up, and Voila!  Clutch works again.

While I had her disconnected, etc., I took a hard look at the Bowden  
tube and saw no
signs of wear (woot!), sprayed all the pedal assemblies with silicon  
grease, etc.

Thanks for everyone's help and advice.  It is very much appreciated  
and now I know
what to look for in the future.   I'm also looking forward to lots of  
smooth clutching and
shifting (did the tranny mounts and shift bushing this summer) in my  
immediate future.

Cheers,
