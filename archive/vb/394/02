Subject: interior panels

I'm about to put the interior back into my 60. The door panels are in OK 
shape but they do have a couple of problems ... they are a bit soft and 
kinda spongy at the very bottom. I'm thinking about painting the backs or 
something .. I wonder what would be the best stuff to use. I really want to 
keep these panels as condition is basically good ... and I want to keep my 
pockets.
