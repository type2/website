Subject: hello and clutch confusion

hi all, i've just joined on here.  been reading
content for years.  i recently joined the split world
with a 67 westy so42.  nice old bus, 100% stock and
complete.  usual rust - currenntly being  re-done.  

my first question is....which clutch kit do i need? 
i'm putting a 1600 dp into the 67.  do i buy the early
clutch kit or the later one?  something about collar
or no collar?

thanks in advance
