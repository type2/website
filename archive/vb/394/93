Another alternative if you can't take it apart is to
use spray chain lube available from motorcycle shops.
Sprays  like a light oil, so it can get into tight
spaces, yet dries into a thick grease.

Be sure to spray and let it sit. If you move the joint
while "drying" it will not thicken up where you need
it to be, when thin it will have worked out of the
tight spaces.
