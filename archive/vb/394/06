Minwax makes a product called Wood Hardener, you brush it on rotten
wood and it infiltrates the wood fibers, gluing them back together.
There was an article in Make: magazine some time ago about using it to
strengthen and waterproof cardboard tubes for model rockets; the
author compared the treated cardboard to phenolic plastic.  I haven't
tried it on my own panels because the local Orange Homestore doesn't
seem to carry it.  My only concern would be it could maybe cause the
panel to curl.

The same article talked about using Future brand floor wax as a
topcoat for painted surfaces, as it contains a clear acrylic paint.
It sure made the hood of my beater
pickup shiny for a while.
