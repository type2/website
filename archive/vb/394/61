usually if there is only a click when you try to start the bus, it is the starter failing to spin.  
 Usually the dash lights will dim at the same time.   
This can be 
 
low/bad battery.
bad connections at battery
bad starter (my guess in your case)
 
etc.

need advice, the switch has always worked fine, but one day all it would do is 
make a click when I tryed to start. It did this several times, so I gave up. A 
few dayes later it worked fine. Still is working. Do I need to replace it. I 
would hate to go somewhere, and it not start again. thanks, Bob
