Hi,

My gage has the same problem. I asked one of the guys that  does the speedo 
restoration and he said to live with it. Once you open the  front bezel by 
prying up the chrome ring, it doesn't go back very  nicely.

Anyone have  better  information?



I have open my gauges (on another brand of car...BMW Isetta if you must  
know), cleaned and polished them, and then taken them to a "speedo shop," and  
they re sealed them and they look great. If you have a speedo shop in your town,  
ask them how they would like to handle it. 
You NEED their special machine to reseal the gauge. But they may charge you  
the same to clean and re seal as to just re seal. 
Support local specialty shops!
