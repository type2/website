Subject: Revenge of the Odd Carb Sound

Many months ago I posted with an odd carburetor sound. A "sucking" sound 
that seemed to come from the 2/4 cyl side. I could take a sound pipe and 
the sound was definitely a sound that was much louder at the carb 
entrance. Very odd sound that I never got fixed. I tried to blow out the 
carb as well as replace the intake gasket. Nothing seemed to fix it. 
Performance was fine also so I just drove it. It would however never 
idle correctly and always wanted to idle very high almost as if it were 
way too rich.

A week or so ago the sound went away, and with that the high idle. I 
thought it quite odd, but kept an ear out for any new sounds. The next 
day when I filled up with gas it appeared I now had greater fuel 
economy. Last night when I filled up the tank I did a mpg calculation 
and jumped from a regular 19mpg to 23.8 mpg. This would suggest the carb 
was infact running richer for some reason. I'm still puzzled by that. 
Any suggestions?
