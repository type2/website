Subject: RE:Splash Pans and Belly Pans

I'm not sure about splash pans but I do know Gerson does excellent belly
pans, I just installed a set on the 56 Sunroof last month. The pics of that
are on my website in my sig line. www.klassicfab.com  is his website. There
should be some sources for his parts in the states real soon. J
