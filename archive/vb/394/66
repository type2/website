Subject: Re: [VB] brake lines

you can buy the rubber flex lines from any VW supply place.   
These are a normal wear item that goes bad with age.   If you don't know when they were last replaed, or it was over 5 years, better safe than sorry.
Yes do spray penetrating oil on where it connects the metal lines.
Also use a line wrench, which wraps around 4 sides of the hex.   When you break the nut free, wiggle back and forth to make sure the nut spins on the metal line, it can stick to the metal line and twist and break the line.
 
 
If you mean replacing the metal line, yes you can do that too.   I have done it when he nut stuck to the line when I was removing a flex line, and it twisted the metal line off.   My local brake place can make them, as long as I can tell them the length... which is in the on-line parts list I believe.
 
I think that the usual sources also might carry a 'set' of all the metal lines.
 
The metal lines don't tend to go bad.  If you are fixing a bus that has salt corrosion, though, wouldn't hurt to replace the metal lines.

When you say lines, do you mean the steel lines or the rubber hoses at the
wheels?

If it is the wheels, you just order four hoses, two at the front, two at
the rear, appropriate to your bus.  Shoot the old ones with penetrating
oils for several days before attempting removal.

If you mean the steel lines, things get more complicated, but I think you
probably mean the rubber hoses unless you have a severe corrosion problem.
