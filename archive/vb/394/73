Subject: Re: [VB] cleaning gauge faces..

Hi JD,
Have tried to pry loose the bezels off of those, always ended up  snapping.  
Have not had any big problems removing bezels off of any  other gauge except 
the Bus clock.
  So best to carefully cut the cylinder just forward of the bezel  (FIF) and 
figure out how to splice it back together.  Some aluminum  from a soda can, 
and a couple of hose clamps with a little RTV sealant  should work.  The deluxe 
splice would be to lathe out one....
