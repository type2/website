When you say lines, do you mean the steel lines or the rubber hoses at the
wheels?

If it is the wheels, you just order four hoses, two at the front, two at
the rear, appropriate to your bus.  Shoot the old ones with penetrating
oils for several days before attempting removal.

If you mean the steel lines, things get more complicated, but I think you
probably mean the rubber hoses unless you have a severe corrosion problem.
