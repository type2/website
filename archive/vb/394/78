The '58 comes with extra stuff that I'm not willing to seperate at this
time.  Obviously being a double door it has belly pans.  It has:

 

Roof Rack 3/4 length

Two Tents (baywindow, excellent condition, both sets of poles)

Wiring Harness (not installed, purchased through you)

Bumpers (front & back from Ronnie in Havasu)

Front Bench (re-upholstered)

Extra Set of Doors (with windows, new rubber/glass)

Brakes were done by Chris Hardy (All new within the year)

New steering box by Wolfgang (installed by Tony at TnT)

King Pin/Link Pins (Whole front end by Tony at TnT)

Emergency Brake (works)

Side Mirrors (from Ronnie in Havasu)

Extra Set of Tail Lights (correct small lights for a '58, from Ronnie in
Havasu)

Heater Boxes (not on Bus)

Rubber Mat (correct mat for cab area)

Z-Bed (full size with Riviera mechanisms)

Michelin Tires P205/75 R15 (with some wear but new this year)

Brand New Bosch Starter (just installed)

New Battery (less than a year used)

1600 DP duel carb (mexican motor from Chris Hardy, balanced and SOLID)

Custom Plates (58DDBUS will through in also)

 

Can't think of anything else at the time.  This bus is very solid so I'm
asking $10K.  Rust is minimal.
