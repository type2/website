Subject: Re: [VB] Rear hatch locking mechanism...?

the rear hatch mechanism for a '67 has a finger loop.   This is different than the 66 and earliers.
I believe the hole in teh door is different, too. 
 
However, I think the same mechanism is used on Bay buses, though i dunno if on all years.   
I have even seen a splitty rear hatch (from a deluxe jail bara and all) on a bay, the whole thing seems the same, except the bays had a rear window defogger, while the splitts didn't.
(okay, very rare option)
 
 
-----Original Message-----Hi,

  Does anyone know if the rear hatch locking mechanism is different for a
67?  Is it 67 only, cause it looks like it's more hex looking than round?

Thanks for any help!!!  -- J
