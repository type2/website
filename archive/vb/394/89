Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch Pedal Doesn't Return

Tom we needed to clean and polish the shaft for the clutch pedal arm.
Requires removing the cable, nut, clutch lever arm, then you can remove 
the clutch pedal.

is some of our fix for a bay problem.
Years of no maintenances.
If you remove the cable and this clutch pedal will be still tight and 
stiff due to binding on the shaft.
Lube lube!!!
