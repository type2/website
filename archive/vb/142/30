This is a great idea in theory but what we have been discussing is not
widely accepted by all bus owners.  Also it is clearly not stock so a lot of
time and energy must be focused on what has been done to offset any negative
affects that come with it.

As a general rule once you vary from stock there is some positive affect and
some negative affect depending on what is changed.  There are very few "free
lunches" or free horsepower no matter how simple the change maybe.

Some of the stuff covered in the chain e-mails is still somewhat unproven
and could take some effort to work the kinks out.  (like fans exploding)

Also the novice bus person should really refrain from attempting any form of
modifications until they understand how the stock base system works... I
always cringe when I see a newbie asking about how to build a 2.0L+ stroker
as their first engine build, and then wanting to pay only $1000 for it! And
they wonder why it blows up in 10,000 miles :)

KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) applies here very well unless you are a glutton
for punishment like a few others and myself :)  ... It takes lots of trial,
error, broken parts, and wasted time before you find tangible results that
work.
