It means your revs were low (alternator not charging or not charging
very much) and the load was relatively high - just the brake lights
are ~54 watts, running lights add 17 watts, and if you had the 
headlights on that adds another 100 watts.  The coil is maybe 100
to 120 watts, and the choke heater is around 10 watts.  You could
have been asking for over 300 watts from an alternator (probably
rated around 600 watts) that was spinning at just barely over idle,
so it might not be too surprising that it couldn't keep up.

If everything else electrical is OK - the battery doesn't run down
mysteriously, lights are nice and bright, etc - then I wouldn't
worry about it.  If you want to play with something, work over
the ground straps at the battery and tranny nosecone if that wasn't
done when you did the harness work.  Other than that it's probably
fine.
