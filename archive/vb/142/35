Y'all,

I just posted the pictures from the Bug-in at Portland International =
Raceway this weekend.  All the pictures I posted are of Buses save one.  =
There was a really nice bug there with all the trimmings that anyone who =
is a VW fan might enjoy.

Check em out:  http://community.webshots.com/user/tempor4
Choose the Bug-in folder.

For some random photos of our '67, check out the other folder ('67 Bus).

Let me know if you like, dislike, or otherwise.
Greg
