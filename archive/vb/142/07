you can get the front coupler repro.  I had to do that for my 61, which uses 
the two screw front coupler.  The repro wasn't the greatest - the ID was off 
(WW) but works. less that $10 I think.

As heat/cooler shock treatments didn't work, I Used a grinder to slice the 
old coupler longwise.   or was it around the middle?  It's in the archives a 
few years back- wear eye and ear protection, cut he old coupler off, when off 
its easy to removethe other bits and replace the shift bushings.  DO NOT mess 
up the shift sticks- they can be a PITA to find.  I can't belive that E&B cut 
that nose off that bus for me to get the rear shift linkage out, but as 
theirs was bad they really needed it to do the gear shift.
