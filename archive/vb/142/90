Subject: Re: [VB] Should I Cut Up A Bus?

Jon,
Id love to have a double door panel, I wish I had one of those 23 window
deluxes in solid, clean shape to cut up for you in trade.After all it would
only be a deluxe, and we all know its all about the commercial
vehicles...... =)

but seriously, If i were in your shoes .. well i would cut up the westy or
almost any deluxe before a panel , but thats just me, I prefer the comercial
type 2s . Like you said though , it is your van to do with as you choose ,
and in the end it would contribute to the resurection of multible vehicles.
It is a rarity being a double door , if anything , offer it up for trade for
something less rare but in equal condition , That way a rare bus is saved
and you have a donor van. If no one wants it , well.. break out the sawz-all
(what you want for those wheel wells?)
