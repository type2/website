As I pulled into the garage tonight I noticed a slight glow on my alternator
light on the speedo. Took foot off the brake and it disappeared. Any ideas
what this might be?? 

Electrical harness was removed, cleaned up and connectors repaired before
re-installed along with new Bosch alternator 13,600 miles ago.

At idle speeds the gen isn't charging and you are eventually running off
your battery. With accessories on, i.e. headlights, brake lights, radio,
etc, then there is a further drain on the battery and you will see the
gen/oil light slightly glow as the voltage level in the battery is demanding
a charge and the primary regulator relay is engaged but the generator is
running at too low of an RPM to deliver it. It's common and nothing to worry
about. A bright red light is something to worry about.
