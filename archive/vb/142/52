Excellent point Ray (I have come to expect no less from Ray's knowledge)!

But if the T3 tin was so much better, why did VW not put it on the T1 long
after the T3 had faded away and the T4 was in full swing?

I had another thought today which perplexed me... Why can the cast iron
cylinders be painted regular flat black paint (like Hoover recommends) and
it does not peel off from the high temperatures?  This almost makes me
believe that not much cooling is actually done by the cast iron cylinders...
Someone please enlighten me on this?  Maybe that is why the Birals and
Nickies are so good because they actually wick heat away.

Keep it coming :)
