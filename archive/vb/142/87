Subject: Bus Parts Needed

For a friend of mine--1964 Bus--He needs the 4 way flasher light assembly
that fits just to the left of the Speedo Pod--I think it is a chrome
ring--red lens and bulb holder--Also a rear view mirror, no pits,--and the 4
screws that hold in the taillights--small stuff,   but he needs help, and is
a friend of mine--Hopefully, uj--Please p-mail me with any info--thanks
