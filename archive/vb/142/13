Subject: Re: [VB] '59 Single Cab...friggin' shift rod!!!!

Rex,

I think you asked the question before about swapping a late shift rod into
an earlier bus. Someone posted a response that the later shift lever had a
pin that wouldn't fit into the earlier shift rod. Does this mean that you
could put a later shift rod in your truck if you used a later shifter?

| Comments and/or suggestions welcome.
