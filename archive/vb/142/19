I have two VW de Mexico engines, one in a '71 bus with about 25K miles and
one in a '69 bug with 15K miles.  They are built with Brazilian cases,
and Mexican heads.

The only mechancial failure on either engine was a single broken cylinder
stud.  I check valves every 2K and they don't need much adjustment.  The
engines are low compression and never ping, even on 85 octane gas.

I bought my engines from Ronnie at Old Volks Home and experienced prompt
delivery (engines drop-shipped from LA).  The engines were in VW de Mexico
boxes and strapped to pallets.  A new oil cooler was included.

Would I do it again?  Sure!

George
