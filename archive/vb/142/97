Hi Jim,
That is OK.  If it is a VDO voltage gauge it should have a color band to show 
good and bad charging.  Green is good!  Higher voltage is better if you drive 
in town and stop your engine often, by charging the battery better.  Yes, 
check your battery for water level more often till you get a sense of how 
much often it needs to be topped off.  Just never let any of the lead plates 
become exposed to the atmosphere or risk battery explosion just by turning 
the key!

The too low of oil pressure could be due to so many things, but at least not 
an old worn engine since your's has low mileage on it since last rebuild if 
it was done properly.  Could be wrong pressure relief valves, wrong oil pump 
(Yes too small or too big can have the same result!), too high of oil temp, 
clogged oil cooler causing high oil temp or even wrong oil and/or wieght of 
oil.
