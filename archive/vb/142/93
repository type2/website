I don't know of anything specific but it was probably along the
lines of "fix your oil leaks and this won't be a problem".  I
can see the cylinders getting dusty, but if there's no oil in
the cooling air it's hard for much else to stick to them.

I wonder about the cool solvent hitting warm cast iron and
aluminum alloy.  If the engine isn't super hot it's probably
OK but it might better to warm the solvent first.

It might be a Good Thing *if* you disconnected the heater box
to body tubes and capped off the body tubes.  You _will_ smell
any solvent you spray into the ducts for a while, and spraying
down the windshield with it is probably not a good idea.

Or plumb in the airflow meter from a later model fuel-injected car...
