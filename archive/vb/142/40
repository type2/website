Okay since we are on the maximum fan air issue with pulley ratios... Lets
talk air flow :)

It has been reported by a few very knowledgeable people that the T3 bottom
tin "super cool tin" modification that a lot of us perform is counter
productive to maximum air flow.

Why you ask?  Because the T3 tin is more restrictive and creates more
backpressure which means less air actually makes it past the cylinders to
cool them down.  I do not think anyone can disagree with that statement.  
***********************************************************
Well, I guess that answers why T-3 went out of production, but why did T-4
stay in production for so long? No, really, VW engineers put a lot of
thought and testing into the air channels and sheet metal on T-3 and T-4 to
make sure they had sufficient air for the engine under the conditions the
vehicle would be used in. If there had been that significant of an airflow
problem there would have been more notice than this by now. The air pressure
and flow in a T-3 and T-4 engine meet the needs for temperature control. In
fact, engineers at Lycoming and Continental added the under cylinder tin
similar to the "super cool" tin for the same reason VW did : to glean every
excess BTU from the fin area with all available air and direct it from the
engine. I don't think that there is as much back pressure as you believe.
You have to remember that VW tin is notorious for leaking and there are
plenty of avenues to relieve excess pressure.
