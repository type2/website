sounds like you are putting spindles on the bus.   You can adjust the links 
when everything is assembled- 
jack bus up
find the two 17mm pinch bolts, and loosen them
use 17mm wrench to snug the links down- don't tighten them too much- just 
snug it, like the idiot book says
retighten pinch clamps so the links dont turn.

if you are assembling, yes, line up the link so the worm groove lets the 
pinch bolt through.  grease everything.  grease the link pin needles bearings 
before assmbly. grease grease grease.
you can snug down the links before or after attaching the brake assembly.  
You tighten the pinch bolt AFTER you adjust the link- as the pinch bolt 
pinches the link fromt turning.  the pinch bolt has to be not pinching to let 
the link turn.
