Subject: RE: [VB] Air backpressure

Hi Mike,

The short answer is no.  To keep the cylinders cool you need two things to
happen:

First and foremost the cylinder must wick and radiate heat out to be
"caught" by the passing air.  The better the cylinder material the better
radiating that can occur.  Cast iron is what most VWs use, which is fairly
poor at this task, but given the horsepower output of a VW it does not
matter much.  Some people paint the cylinder flat black to help keep rust
off and provide a good bed to wick heat away.  Then the high rollers move up
to Birals or Nickies, http://www.lnengineering.com/ (the best!  just bring
your wallet.).

Secondly, airflow.  The more air you can pass over the cylinder the better.
So the more CMF you can get the better the heat will be moved away from the
cylinder and more cool air that will pass over the hot cylinders.  Look at
the 911 and see the mass quantities of air that go over the cylinders, lots
of heat too because the engine is tuned higher than any ACVW.

*Third, one to grow on information :)  A lot of people like to compare the
911s to the ACVW motors... Sometimes this is a good thing and sometimes bad.
For the example of cooling I think it is most always a bad comparison
because of the cylinder material differences.  When comparing the early 911
to an ACVW you can draw some similarities, but not the later Birals or
Nickies (which are awesome and waaay better at dispersing heat).  Heck the
early 911s with cast iron cylinders sucked just as bad as the ACVW at
getting rid of heat.  Once the 911 moved to the Nickies later in life the
power potential was unleashed and at least in the 911SC model the P&Cs can
live upwards of 400K miles untouched (no joke - documented by many
people)...  When you run Nickies I am sure you could toss the Blue Book
(Berg) and add a few more points to the CR as well due to the better cooling
:)  Muuuuhahahaha

Also to note in the 70s Mahle made a bore in 88mm P&C set for EMPI that was
of biral design... Not sure why it died off.  You can read about it in Bill
Fisher's book if you care to. 

** As a side note to the previous discussions on the 912 pulley upgrade be
sure to take care of your fan as to not let it explode due to the higher
RPMs it will be turning (Eric&Barb reminded me to mention this in an
off-list e-mail).  I will be welding the tabs on mine before installing the
pulley.  I think Berg still offers a welded fan if you do not care to weld
one up yourself.

Doesn't the slow down effect of cool tin force more heat exchange from a
larger
area of the cylinders?
