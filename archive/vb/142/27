Subject: Restoring indicator switches

Is there anyway to restore indicator switches, mines on a 66 euro bus. The
problem is that if I indicate right, and then turn right, as soon as the tab
on the steering wheel touches the switch, it switches off.  Also if I try to
indicate right when the tab is already there the indicators will not stay
on.  However left indicators were fine.  I though maybe it needed some
lubricant, so I put some lock graphite onto it.  This then prevented the
indicators from staying on ever.  I then used contact cleaner to clean it
back on, and I am virtually back to the condition I was in previously.
Any ideas on how to make it work correctly again or am I going to have to
search for another?

Thanks
Paul
