I spoke with the smith in town with the most time in the key business and he 
recommended that I bring the ignition and passenger side door handle with me, 
since this is the lock that traditionally sees the least amount of use. 

I am not sure if I am going to go through the "all out" it would take to find 
NOS key blanks. I don't think that a "correct" restored bus is what I am 
about. I want to enjoy the bus and I want it to enjoy me, so it's 
re-introduction to modern life will gentle and convenient.

I no longer have any doubt that I will be able to get keys that will make my 
bus go. Thanks to all the replies!!
