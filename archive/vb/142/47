As I pulled into the garage tonight I noticed a slight glow on my alternator light on the speedo. Took foot off the brake and it disappeared. Any ideas what this might be?? 

Electrical harness was removed, cleaned up and connectors repaired before re-installed along with new Bosch alternator 13,600 miles ago.
