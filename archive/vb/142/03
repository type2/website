Subject: proper link pin tightening technique?

Hi,

I'm assuming when tightening link pins, that you are supposed to line up 
the hole and groove so you can get the bolt through, then tighten, then 
turn the link pin until it is fully engaged, then torque down to 28 ft 
lbs. But I thought I read somewhere that said, "don't tighten too much."

The several books I have say - tighten up the link pin clamps, then put 
on the brake backing plate...like they skipped a couple of steps.

Thanks,
Conrad
