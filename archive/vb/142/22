Hi! 
This is my first post. As suggested I have been receiving the mail now for 
several weeks and have been loving every minute of it! 

I have '67 deluxe project that is just starting to take off. I am not 
unfamiliar with the beautiful air cooled VW, but this is my first type ll.

I need to get keys for my bus, as it had none when I bought it. I took the 
ignition switch and door handles out and they are all stamped with the same 
number. Does this mean that I can just order new keys from a good VW parts 
supplier with this number?

Thanks for all the good information!

-Greg
