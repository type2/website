Excellent point Ray (I have come to expect no less from Ray's knowledge)!

But if the T3 tin was so much better, why did VW not put it on the T1 long
after the T3 had faded away and the T4 was in full swing?

*************************************************************
To answer your question as to why VW didn't put T-3 tin on T-1 motors, Matt
had the answer to that long ago - cost. Any major corporation interested in
earning their keep is going to put as little money into their product as
they can and have it still run reasonably well. The small T-1 cylinder tin
has worked well, not necessarily best, for almost 70 years, why mess with
it. As far as the paint issue on cylinders, that is a two edged sword. VW
and GM did not paint their cylinders because their engineers believed that
the coating of paint would reflect heat back inside. Many of the air-cooled
radial engine manufacturers did paint their cylinders because of opposite
thinking. Who is right? Who knows?
