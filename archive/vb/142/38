Hope this isn't out of line for a Monday.  Around 2:30, or so this
afternoon, FoxNews was doing a piece on the Miners in PA being lucky
they survived.  They jumper back to 1962 about a Mining accident, I
believe in Germany (Didn't get the first part).  About the time I saw it
a Splitwindow Ambulance was coming into the Frame and the Camera
followed it.  Pretty Cool, thought the Baywindow may want to hear also.
