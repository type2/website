Subject: Re: [T2] Oil temps and FMBC thanks

With out going into specifics,  I have always followed noted that the 
more professional oil cooler companies state that thermostats are needed 
to prevent drops below 180 and that the minimum that oil should ever run 
at is 150.  the max suggested is at 25 Oil company data though it doesnt 
come right out with numbers suggest the same numbers.  Data i have gone 
by for years is that if your  temps are consistantly at or above 230 get 
an oil cooler.  I am now adding one to my westy because my highway temps 
are always hitting the 230  mark.  I dont know where i got the 230 
number from.  been to many years.  I do remember that it had to do with 
engine operations rather than oil breakdown.
