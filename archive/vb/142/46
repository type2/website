I have always wondered about this... Sure you can have a balanced fan, but
it is worthless unless the pulley and generator is balanced with it.  Just
having the fan balanced is like dynamically balancing a crank without the
flywheel.

Actually I was planning on taking the whole fan/gen/pulley assembly to Jake
Raby to try and balance it anyway :)  I say try because I have not heard of
anyone doing this before...
