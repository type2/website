To veer from the airflow discussion a bit...
I've pulled apart a bunch of junk yard engines and see a 
lot of debris and oil bound dirt caked on the cyls and 
heads. 
So... Did VW have any preventive maintenance tips for 
this problem? Did Porsche filter the cooling air? Any 
procedure to clean off the dirt with the engine in 
place? 
How about an atomized solvent at the front of the 
shroud? Warm up the engine, remove the fan belt, use a 
drill to turn the fan and watch the cascade of debris. 
No need to run the engine while the solvent does it's 
work on the fins. Tape off the heater tubes, or would 
cleaning the debris out of the head exchangers be a Good 
Thing. Of course this would remove the "rust proofing" 
from the tin needed in humid climates. Perhaps a shot of 
rust converter after the solvent is dry. 
Hmmm, use an ammeter on the drill to measure air 
resistance before and after treatment. Use an inspection 
scope to see how fuzzed up the fins are. We clean out 
preheat tubes don't we? Any thoughts?

You do have a Halon fire extinguisher system installed in your engine
compartment. No residue of solvents should remain on an engine after it is
installed in a vehicle. Break out the Marshmallows and Hotdogs !
