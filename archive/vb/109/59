Subject: Re: [VB] VW CD's??

Michael,
I picked one of these up and unfortunately did not ask specific questions 
because it includes ZERO info on split window buses.  Model index for TIIs 
starts at '68.  I believe it's the dealer's software because my buses don't 
show up on my dealer's screen and it helps only if a bug shares the part.  All 
the other models are probably there but I lost interest in digging since most 
of it did not apply for me...

sigh.
