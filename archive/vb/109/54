Subject: VW CD's??

It appears that someone has gotten their hands on "official" VW parts =
manual software on CD and is selling these on ebarf.

Does anyone know if these are being widely distributed and how legit they =
are?

Just curious- I am surprised that VWOA doesn't already have a team of =
lawyers on their case
