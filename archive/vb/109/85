<< ve used the same system for my drain plug after looking all over town for
 a hex-head socket. I can't take credit for inventing it though, while
 looking for a socket to fit, I took a 17mm hex bolt to a hardware store and
 told the guy "this fits perfectly" he went over to the metric nut bins and
 took out two, screwed them on to the bolt and said "here's your answer." I
 looked at it for a couple of seconds and then the lights went on. Not only
 is it effective, it cost a fraction of what a wrench or socket would.

not to take anything away from any body or to dampen your spirits(i have used 
this for many situations where i didnt have the tool)for haveing thought of 
it .

but the right 17mm allen socket is available in a number of places(by its 
self or in sets) you could try Sears Hardware, any of the tool trucks you see 
on the road should have it on board,or a good parts store that carries S-K or 
Proto tools should have it.
aat least they do in my area.
but then again i somedtimes get spoiled at what i can get easily, because of 
the area
