Hi Al,
We do have tool 266H, but often we just loosen the locking nut and hit the 
side of the spindle/pitman arm to momentarly distort the taper fit hole in 
the arm which causes the tie/drag end to pop loose.

Sounds like you do not have grounding wires run to each of the rear 
taillights going directly to the battery ground strap mounting point on the 
body!  VW finaly figured this was a must in 1970ish when they made it a 
factory item on each and every VW bus.
