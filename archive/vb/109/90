Subject: How to tell a NOS round bus mirror???

Anyone have or seen a truly NOS aluminum round mirror
lately?  My repro set has a dull plain finish on it. 
all my older original ones are polished aluminum.  I
found a set that are suposed to be NOS but the finish
is a brush type finish.  I thought original morrors
were polished.  anyone know for sure?

Also,  what markings beside the part # should be on
the ring on the back?

thanks
Matthew
