dunno that 63s got seat belt mounts installed (was an option for some times- 
standard in 66 or 65?)

so they mount where you mount them- use a big fat washer underneath to spread 
the load.  I used 1" sections of torsion leaves as washers when installing 
seat belts in my 61- and that stuff is hard to cut and drill, but flexy.
