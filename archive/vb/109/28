EZ-Lok company makes an insert 5/8"-18 on the outside, M12x? on the inside.
Their online catalogue only lists 1/2" and 3/4" depths, I'll call them and see
if they have anything deeper hidden away. They also list VW case-savers among
their products, and have a photo of a bug on their website (don't tell VW).
Anyone familiar with their inserts?
