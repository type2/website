Subject: Timing for altitude: was--My trip to Time-Fastener

The spec I'm familiar with is one degree of advance
for every thousand feet of elevation above sea level. 
But here in Albuquerque (5000 ft), I just time to 30+
max advance, and figure I'm OK anywhere.  I had to
switch to premium at last year's OCTO/Classic weekend
only because I got my compression ratio too high in my
1776.
