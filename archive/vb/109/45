  Erin Lasley of Buskatier fame fashioned a tool to undo the fan nut from
the back to take it off to facilitate the removal of a generator while the
engine is still in the bus. Time start to finish 1/2 hour.

David, you will look for any excuse to install the new engine, it's properly
just brushes which can be changed in the engine is still in the bus.

Hi All,

I've diagnosed my tipper electrical problems to a faulty generator. So, I
opened up the shop manual (the red and gray one since I have yet to locate
an original VW workshop manual that covers the 67) and the first line I read
is "Remove Engine".

Is this true?  Last night, I started in on this project and quickly realized
after I had removed the carb, taken the bolts/nuts off of the intake
manifold, generator pedestal, etc that I still couldn't remove the
generator.  Maybe Muir is right in saying "watch how it gets more difficult
as the years go by".

Thoughts?  Is this the straw that forces me to just pull the motor and
replace it with a correct 1500 h-case AR motor?



David
