Subject: new member 1967 deluxe..

Hello there list, im new here, but been on vintagvw for years but just 
recently acquired a reason to wander around these here parts.
http://members.aol.com/jcwfla/bus.jpg  is that reason!
Ok I bought the bus as a quasi project, its runs and drives (sorta) but sat 
for a long time and needs lots of things.
Thing #1 - it needs a master cylinder. Ive changed these on bugs before and 
thought nothing of it, until seeing that its 1 yr only and $195 at bus-boys! 
Im sure the seller had a laugh.. i didnt imagine this was the case. Anyone 
rebuild these? Its literally pouring fluid out of the shaft...
thing #2 - Needs shift bushings, sloppy (doesnt pop out of any gears tho), 
one in the front, what about the coupler in the rear, where is it and how 
hard to get to? (whole job..)?
thing #3 - has the safari windows and a stock antenna. How do i bend the 
antenna to accomodate the safaris? should I take it to a machine/metal shop? 
Just put it in a vise and overcompensate the bend to get it in the ballpark? 
(it bends back).. any ideas?

I think thats the short list for now.. has a few valdez sized oil leaks too 
but those i can resolve with a quick once over on the motor i 
believe..thanks for any help, pmails fine if you can help me..
