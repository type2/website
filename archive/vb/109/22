I'll be there, hope to face to face with some of the list. Is Clara going to
be there also? I know there are a few Seattle area people on the list.

Hi Volks,
Speaking of Puyallup we will be camping starting early Saturday 27th at
Point 
State Park just West of Federal Way, Washington with some of the Wet Westies

club.  Anybody going to be in the area will be welcome to camp with our 
group.  We will be selling at the Spring meet in Puyallup on Sunday the 28th

(Hey David, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more, say no more.....) and
hope 
to see plenty of Vintagebus list members and any other crazed VW owners!
Eric&Barb
