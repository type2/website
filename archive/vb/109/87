I have found the same. Sears has a allen wrench in that size for not a
lot of money and that is what I use. I just used it yesterday to change
the tranny fluid on the 65.

and
 told the guy "this fits perfectly" he went over to the metric nut bins
and
 took out two, screwed them on to the bolt and said "here's your
answer." I
 looked at it for a couple of seconds and then the lights went on. Not
only
 is it effective, it cost a fraction of what a wrench or socket would.

not to take anything away from any body or to dampen your spirits(i have
used 
this for many situations where i didnt have the tool)for haveing thought
of 
it .

but the right 17mm allen socket is available in a number of places(by
its 
self or in sets) you could try Sears Hardware, any of the tool trucks
you see 
on the road should have it on board,or a good parts store that carries
S-K or 
Proto tools should have it.
aat least they do in my area.
but then again i somedtimes get spoiled at what i can get easily,
because of 
the area
