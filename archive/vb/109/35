The Vintage Volkswagen Club of Michigan
The MVVC is attempting to confront Volkswagen on the issue of the trademark
and copyright lawsuits and their alienation of the air-cooled community. To
do this we need your help. The company that made the cars we love is, as the
saying goes "being penny wise, and dollar foolish." In an attempt to protect
it's trade marked properties VW is loosing the die hard loyalists that it
worked on for decades to build. They are driving away the very group that
sustained them in the late 80s and early 90s. We all recognize VW's right to
protect trademarks. But to do so without guidelines for the aftermarket
industry, independent repair facilities and even the hobbyist and clubs is
incredibly short sighted and an insult to their most loyal fans.
Included is a brief form you can fill out. In the form are information boxes
toprovide the demographic information that will show VW what they
potentially can and will loose if they continue to interact with the hobby
in this manner. To put it another way, sadly VW seems to be concerned only
with the dollars earned now from it's legal tactics. Fill out the form, and
show them how many more dollars they will loose later.
