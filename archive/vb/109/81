Subject: Today the single cab was reborn:)

Well after more time than I care to admit I finally got the engine from my
Thing ready to go into the single cab.  Got it in the bus and started tuning
it.  I couldn't find my engine tach so I didn't get to the carb but it ran
okay right out of the box.  I had to fake the breather line from the
alternator stand to the air cleaner as the engine is from my Thing.  There
is no drip tube and the outlet is larger so I just took the old line on the
'65 aircleaner and slipped it into the breather.  Not the best but it fits
okay for now.  I tried to install the engine hatch seal and discovered that
the POS is too big.  Maybe from a bay window instead of a split?  Anyway
something to look into tomorrow.  I couldn't resist and drove it down the
block to the gas station to fill the tank and inflate the tires.  Seems like
I need to adjust the shifter as it doesn't go into first gear.  It felt like
I started out in third but I was determined to get some gas even with brakes
that need to be bled.  Did I mention that I spent all day getting this far
and was hell bent on some kind of forward motion?  Heh, that's why I just
kept going.  My bad:)

And so the saga begins anew...
