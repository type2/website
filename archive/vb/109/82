Subject: Re: [VB] tranny drain plug trick

Don,

I've used the same system for my drain plug after looking all over town for
a hex-head socket. I can't take credit for inventing it though, while
looking for a socket to fit, I took a 17mm hex bolt to a hardware store and
told the guy "this fits perfectly" he went over to the metric nut bins and
took out two, screwed them on to the bolt and said "here's your answer." I
looked at it for a couple of seconds and then the lights went on. Not only
is it effective, it cost a fraction of what a wrench or socket would.

For $1.16 I made a little tool today to get the drain and fill plugs out of
my '65

1 - 3" Automotive bolt with a 17mm head
2  17mm nuts


The two nuts lock each other, so vise grips on the bottom one loosens, on
the top
one, tightens
Not one flaps, or even VW dealer even knew what I was talking about
when I asked about a 3/8 17mm hex socket.  The Foriegn Flaps guy said
"you'll never find anything like that out here" (CT).  So I made this little
thing and it's worked good so far. Will still order the socket from someone
for safe re-tightening

Just thought I'd share my small triumph
