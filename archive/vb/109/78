Charles,

Repairing someone else's "improved" wiring is impossible without a good
wiring diagram. You can find one at Thom Fitzpatrick's website, which is
www.vintagebus.com, do a search and you'll find the wiring diagram you need
in glorious color.
I once had a '66 EZ camper with a "mystery button" on the side of the
steering column, coincidentally my brake lights wouldn't work, until one day
while I was behind the bus, my daughter happened to press the button (what's
this button do Daddy?) and to my amazement the brake lights came on, it
seems that rather than replacing the switch at the master cylinder, my
previous owner wired a button to the switch and pressed it with his finger
as he stepped on the brake pedal...
Good Luck
John Flowers
