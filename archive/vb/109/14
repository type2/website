It's interesting, from an artsy perspective, but it required me to load
stuff to my P/C which smells a little of spyware.  I can't save it
(ie so I can upload it to vintagebus.com) without getting (ie buying)
something called "shockmachine".  I view the whole thing as an attempt
to subrogate the browser model.  

Shockwave and Flash movies are also transport mechanisms for viruses.
