Subject: RE: [VB] The Volkswagen Protest

   A few years ago one of my best friends other half was a designer for VW
and was in charge and the US decision maker for portions of new VW. I can't
really say more because of the confidentiality agreement  signed at
departure from VWoA.  When I asked about the VW nazism about there
trademarks the reply was that VWoA is going to step up to the plate with a
NLA program like Porsche did in the late 80's. In order for them to this
they need to sanitize the market place of ALL non authorized products. The
time I was told of the program was around the same time VW went on the war
path. Rumor has it that there are prototype NLA catalogs be scrutinized for
this program. Porsche bought Stoddard Imports back east and uses them as the
distribution point for the Porsche NLA program. I do hope that VW follows
suit as the parts coming out of the NLA program are as good or better then
ORIGINAL and are accepted in all CONCOURS judging.

VW does license their logos.  We sell floor mats with some of the VW names, 
Jetta, Passat, Golf, Cabriolet, etc., all under license from VWOA.

If you want to offer products with VW trademarks contact VW and work out a 
deal.
