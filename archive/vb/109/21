Early throwout bearing, right?

The place where the bearing rides on the throwout fork tends to wear,
which makes the springs loose.  If this is the case, you need to replace
the throwout fork with a new one.  What usually happens is that one of the
ends of the fork finally fractures and the bearing falls onto the input
shaft.  Good thing you caught it.

I also safety wire the springs in place.  Run thin stainless safety wire
through the holes in the spring clips and around the groove in the outer
race of the bearing.
