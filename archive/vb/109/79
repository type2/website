For $1.16 I made a little tool today to get the drain and fill plugs out =
of my '65

1 - 3" Automotive bolt with a 17mm head
2  17mm nuts


The two nuts lock each other, so vise grips on the bottom one loosens, =
on the top
one, tightens
Not one flaps, or even VW dealer even knew what I was talking about
when I asked about a 3/8 17mm hex socket.  The Foriegn Flaps guy said
"you'll never find anything like that out here" (CT).  So I made this =
little thing and it's worked good so far. Will still order the socket =
from someone for safe re-tightening

Just thought I'd share my small triumph
