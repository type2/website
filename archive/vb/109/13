I slapped together some pics of our local Mardi Gras parade from 2001 using
Shockwave's PhotoJam. Neat app, easy to use. You'll see listees Karl
(aufever) and Todd&Lisa and the obligatory group shot. 

This link is only up for 9 days. It has 17 pics, I don't know how it will do
over a dial-up connection.

Let me know what you think! Thom, Ev,  better start a section for these!
