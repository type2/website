Hi Charles,
Guess we were not clear enough in the last Email!  ;-)  We take the new used 
TS with cut off wiring harness and dissassemble it and the old TS on the bus. 
 We take a soldering iron to the circuit board of the new TS and desolder one 
wire.  Next we desolder the same color wire from the TS in the bus.  Lastly 
we solder this wire to the circuit bord of the new TS.  Rinse and repeat this 
proceedure till each and every wire attached to the bus is now soldered to 
the new TS!
