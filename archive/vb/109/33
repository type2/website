Subject: help with 76 automatic

Hi all,

I think I found a nice bus right here in New jersey.
It's a 76 lime green automatic. I'm going to see it at
3pm today. The owner said it gives off blue smoke
which I've read means it is burning oil. Is this
caused by a serious problem? About how much will it
cost to fix? Are there any specific problems I should
be looking for with this model year or with the
automatic? Thanks for any help you can give.

Mike
