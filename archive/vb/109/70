I had the same problem, although not as extreme. My switch had a *bit*
of play in it, which I was able to take up with some tape. I used black
2" cloth tape and it blends with both the switch housing and the column.

Well, I've got my switch rebuilt and looking nice...we'll see how well
it operates.  My next question is, how does it clamp to the steering
column, is the a bushing of some kind that goes between the switch and
the column? When I screw both halves together around the steering
column, it's too big to stay up, it just flops down to the brace.  What
gives?
