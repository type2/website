There is a 12V equiv., I have one on my '65 DC and the 4 way flashers do
work with it. You have to order it directly from a Bosch distributor.

The Bosch part # is 0332 015 001. I bought it from Julianna Co,
800-334-0476.

It mounts a bit differently from the 6V equiv. The 6V piece grounds thru the
cap via a clip that mounts to a hole in a boss under the dash. The new piece
has a separate connector on the circuit board for the ground. Just run a
jumper from this lug to ground.
