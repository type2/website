 So it SEEMS this one is in generally better condition and has less 
 wear...but there's really no way to know for sure. My other was a big 
 nut too.
 ==============
having had a similar (but worse) experience- (the used tranny I put in was 
worse than the one I took out), it makes you wonder it is worth it?   I mean, 
it's that much work to install it, and unless you KNOW it is good, it may be 
better to get a rebuild.  It's a cost- time pay off.
....................
 I guess time and a little driving will tell for sure. If anyone can 
 remember how to adjust that shift plate...like which direction does 
 what...let me know. I'll try and work it all out tommarrow and get my 
 bus back on the road.

the odd corner goes across from reverse- so think upside down and mirror 
image.
 
To adjust it loosen the two bolts and shift it into reverse.   snug bolts 
down and try gears.  I had to readjust mine a bit a couple thousand miles 
after I put the tranny in my 61.  I started having to push down to get into 
1st/2nd- kind of like reverse, but oit popped up when I was in gear.   So I 
loosened the bolts, knocked the thing to the right, and snugged them.  
..................

 I think the hardest part of the whole thing for me was trying to get 
 the reduction gear box to spring plate bolts back in. Tough getting 
 'em lined up and all that. Did it though.
 =========
that's always a bear.  it helps to clean up and greas ethe threads before 
installation, so the bolts are easily hand screwed in.

 That's it for now. Any comments welcome. >>

since it's a used tranny, do change your gear oil in a few hundred miles.   

then change it again in another 500-700 miles.   depending on how dark it is- 
if it is really bad change it every 500 miles till it stays pretty clean.
