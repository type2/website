I have never had a problem.  I'm not drowing the wheel with it.  Just
sending a quick squirt down the keyway slot.  Any time you use a torch you
should have a extinguisher handy just in case.  Guess I forgot to mention
that as it is second nature for me.

Isn't WD40 rather combustible- how do you keep the heat from igniting the
lubricant?

Loosen up the nut holding the wheel tight then squirt a little WD40, PB
Blaster, or whatever spray lubricant you have handy.  Then get a propane
torch and heat up the center hub of the wheel.  (Don't over heat of course.)
After about 30 seconds or so use the palms of your hands and pound upward on
the bottom of the sterring whell.  Should come off in a few whacks.

Used this method about a dozen times.  Works great with no damage to the
wheel.
