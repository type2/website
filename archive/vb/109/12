I slapped together some pics of our local Mardi Gras parade from 2001 =
using Shockwave's PhotoJam. Neat app, easy to use. You'll see listees Karl =
(aufever) and Todd&Lisa and the obligatory group shot.=20

This link is only up for 9 days. It has 17 pics, I don't know how it will =
do over a dial-up connection.
