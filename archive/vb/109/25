Hi Isaiah,
We replaced our seals around the front doors and the cargo doors on our 1960 
panel camper conversion about 8 or 9 years ago.  Since we were planning on 
doing body work to this panel van we did not glue in any of the new seals.  
The result so far is only the one bottom passenger door seal has partly 
popped out a few times in freezing weather.  When we do finish the body work 
on our buses we will only glue a few stratigic spots of the seals and let the 
rest hold themselfs in the channels!
