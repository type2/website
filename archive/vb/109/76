OOOOOPPPPPPSSSS, put in a semicolon instead of a colon. Boy am I a colon !

I direct everyone who looks at my motor page of my trike project website to
the following address for the latest edition of the Muir book:

    http://www.costlessbooks.com/vw/index.html

You can actually get all the VW books from this site including the Hot Rod
and Interchange book, the various Beetle/Transporter history books, and of
course the Bentley manuals for different years. I am not affiliated with
them in any way.

I'm looking at my '79 vintage Idiots book (Muir), It has a Bug including the
emblem.  Wonder if the newest ones have the emblem?  Certainly times have
changed!

I don't buy the "clear the decks the real stuff is coming" either. They seem
to be trying to eliminate so much non parts stuff. I saw a poster with a
DRAWING of a beetle and the word "Bug" on it as part if the artistic design.
They got nailed. Vendors that have removed artistic designs that have
included a VW symbol have been hit. And my favorite is the blacked out VW
emblem on a bus in VW Trends magazine. That's incredible.
