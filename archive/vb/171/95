Any clues?  Do I need to start and look at voltage outputs at the battery
and 
generator?? 
-----------------
I've got a 66 and I just either cleaned or replaced every ground
connection I could find on the vehicle.
Prior to that my headlights, turn lights had a mind of their own.
Sometimes they worked and sometimes they didn't.
One note though, my van has a 12v conversion and an alternator.
