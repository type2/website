Subject: RE: The right size carb for the job!

	I just got my new 1776 engine with a 110 Engle cam, counter
weighted crank, and lightened flywheel. I am wondering what would be the
best carb or carbs for the job. I have a Pict30/31 and dual 34 baby
Dells. I am sure I can find in town a pict34 for a good price, But I
would also like to keep some decent mpg for a daily driver.


Any Thoughts,
