Subject: 1950-1962 Bentley Manual

I just got my manual in the mail a few minutes ago, the
culmination of a year and a half of effort to get it printed.

Anyway, this book is awesome!  Just as promised, it covers
just about *everything* from the start of the barndoor era
to the "late-model" 62's.  

I *highly* recommend it, and I'm not just saying that 'cause
I helped talk them into printing it :)
