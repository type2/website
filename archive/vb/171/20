I used Aquarium tank silicone sealant which is supposed to be able to
withstand moisture and temperature variations for an extended period
(whatever that means). I have only had it on for 6 months, so I will see if
I am to be next inline for roofing tar.

Hi Kevin,
We tried Silicon sealant among others for windshield sealant with no luck.  
The only thing that we have found will do the trick is roofing tar!  Eric&
