I bought a handful of OG relays at the last swap meet and went through
them the other day.  One of them had obviously been wet, with corroded
terminals.  It didn't work real well, so I popped the metal cover off
to have a look.  There was some corrosion inside, but it was still
mostly serviceable - except for the return spring.  This holds the
contacts open when the relay isn't energized.  The return spring had
rusted through on one end and was rattling around loose inside the
relay.  This could potentially allow the relay contacts to turn on
with bumps and vibrations, and could also possibly short a contact or
coil wire to the metal casing, which could be bad if the casing was
grounded.  So keep water out of your relays.

One of the other relays has an apparent open coil, so I may steal the
spring from it to fix the rusty one.  Fixing 20-year-old $2 relays,
whee!  :)  On the other hand, you can get them with 40 amp contacts
and their terminals fit the standard automotive relay sockets you can
get today.  About the only drawback is that OG SPDT relays seem rare;
SPST are much more common.

You're welcome.
