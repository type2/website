Subject: Re: [VB] Double Cab Wood Slats 

Hey kevin
VW originally used a compound between the slats and the bed called Sealing
compound D14. Every original truck I have seen, had a thin black (or at
least it looks black after 40-50 years) layer of that sealent between the
slat and bed the *entire* length and it was the width if the slat.
hope that helps
