Subject: RE: [VB] exhaust 'size' question

I ran thin wall 88's until they blew up and later had the block/heads
punched for thick wall 88 or 90.5 (went 88) on my old 71 westy. I used stock
exhaust and heater boxes with 041 heads being the only difference. I had
some mis matched 375 heads on the engine when I bought it and it ran pretty
rough for a dub. When I tore the engine down the first time I noticed that
one head was new and the other was a rebuilt that had also been flycut. A
definite cc mismatch. Anyway, I never noticed any heat problem or exhaust
restriction. I kept the thermostat and flaps in place.

Subject: [VB] exhaust 'size' question


as i'm getting ready to build the 1680cc, i've been wondering about 
the stock exhaust system size; specifically, is the restrictive 
heater box/stock muffler setup going to put too much backpressure in 
and hold too much heat in the heads?
i know berg and kymco make larger 'stock' heater box/extractor 
setups, but they are $$$.
also, i am under the impression that an extractor system will render 
the heat riser useless - correct or no?
