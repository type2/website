Doesn't seem to affect the steel and aluminum fish tank frames, could be a
slightly different formulae for that application. I was mistaken when I
jumped in. My application wasn't for wood slats, it was for window seals.
The jury is still out on the longevity of that.

I remember using a compound similar to DH-3 which was designed for wooden
aircraft use. It was a lightweight epoxy which reminded me a lot of Hi-Tac
or Permatex 3-H.

Hey Dave, what did you use, or have you got to that point?

Don't forget that silicone seal emits acetic acid while curing. May cause
corrosion. I vote for roofing tar.
