A friend brought his VW Art Bus out to Burning Man this year and it had 
2,500 CO2 whippet cartridges glued onto it in a nice decorative 
pattern.  I thought that they were pellet gun CO2  bottles.  Shows what 
I know....  He had plenty of other interesting things  glued on.  Jesus 
was very well represented.  I asked Charlie what he used to adhere these 
objects.  He said that it was silicon 2.  He also said that nothing had 
fallen off over the last year!!!  Gary Gibson
