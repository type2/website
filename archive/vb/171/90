Subject: Re: [VB] rattle ?

That sounds kinda like what my motor is doing.  I've asked like 8 people
about it, and 7 have said that's the exhaust hitting on something.  I've
looked everywhere, and it's not the exhaust.  The other person, and
professional air-cooled VW mechanic, said it was probably the cam.  Does the
rattle sound like the exhaust hitting on the bumper or some other object???
The only difference is that when I increase the RPM's only slightly, the
sound does get faster, but after like 1300-1500 RPM's, the sound of the
motor drowns it out.
