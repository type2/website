Subject: Double Cab Wood Slats 

Howdy,

I thought I'd throw this out on both lists just in case somebody out there 
has an answer but only reads one of them

I'm just about to put wood slats in the rear of my Double Cab.
I will be riveting them on and will be putting clear silicone on the bottom 
of the slats around the rivets
to prevent water from dripping down the holes.

I've been to dropgates.com and haven't seen an answer to my question and 
might post it there also.
But as these lists get read more often and I want to put them in the next 
couple of days I was hoping to get an answer from you guys.

My question is "Should I put silicone along the entire bottom of the slats 
so that water can not get underneath them?"

This truck will see very little rain but my concern is more when I wash it.
I was thinking that water would get underneath the slats and possibly just 
sit there to cause future rust.

I've already spent 8 hours scraping what little rust spots there were on the 
bed and coating them with POR15.

I'd just like to prevent any future rust from occurring.

So what do you think?

Thanks Much,
Kevin
