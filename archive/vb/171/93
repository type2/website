Subject: Tail light question 1960 kombi

I went through and cleaned all my connectors etc, completed the light switch 
repair, and added grounds to both my tail lights.  My turn singnals, running 
lights, and turn signals work just fine (nice and bright)  until I turn on my 
front lights.  The turn signals cycle on and off quickly without the front 
lights on, and go rather slow when the front lights are on.   Also, when the 
rear running lights are on and the turn signals are activated, it is 
difficult to see the lights flash.  They do but its real faint.   When I 
activate my front lights and the turnsignals, my generator light begins to 
glow. 

Any clues?  Do I need to start and look at voltage outputs at the battery and 
generator?? 

Thanks
