Make sure this goes to the big bolt on the solenoid where the battery
cable connects.  This is one of the relay contacts.

This is probably OK.  85 should go to the "start" wire coming from the
ignition key (usually red) and 86 should be grounded.  85 and 86 are
the coil.

>Connector 87: black wire to spade connector on solenoid.

Probably OK.  This is the other relay contact.

Also OK.  When the relay is energized, 30 and 87 are connected, and
when it's off, 30 and 87a are connected.  Since this relay doesn't
run anything when the key isn't in "start", 87a has no connection.

To bypass the relay entirely, you need to connect the "start" wire
from the key directly to the spade connector on the starter.  In your
case it sounds like you need to unplug the wire from terminal 85 and
plug it on to the spade connector on the starter.
