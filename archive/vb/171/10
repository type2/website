Subject: Westy Hook?

You have to follow the Link to answer, short load time.  Were these Hooks
originally on Westies? What year Buses? I found them today, along with 2 Spoon
latches, Bullet Turn Signals (Rear ones missing) and some other odds and ends,
on a 61 Kombi.  One Hook was up near the Drivers Seat and the other was behind
the 3rd Window.
