Subject: new or old studs?

ok, another superfluous opinion request from pesky ol me...
i have a nice set of new, black steel  head studs from ronnie, which 
he vouches for as NOT being the butterscotch taffy the recent 
south-of-the-border ones were.
i also have a set of bright steel studs from my trusty early-80s 
mexican longblock, which has nearly 80K on it.

opinions wanted on  superior old-school metallurgy vs. studs at the 
BEGINNING of their stretch/contract life cycle  :)


or i could just pay berg nearly $100 for some OG ones........
