Subject: My pics are up - engine Q's

I just posted pictures of my newly acquired 1961 DeLuxe. Here's the link:

tell me about this engine... your thoughts please. Seems like something's missing.

This is the one that I need nose skin for. Nose skin with driver side door jamb (front jamb with
hinges).

Thanks,
