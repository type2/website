Subject: exhaust 'size' question

as i'm getting ready to build the 1680cc, i've been wondering about 
the stock exhaust system size; specifically, is the restrictive 
heater box/stock muffler setup going to put too much backpressure in 
and hold too much heat in the heads?
i know berg and kymco make larger 'stock' heater box/extractor 
setups, but they are $$$.
also, i am under the impression that an extractor system will render 
the heat riser useless - correct or no?
