Subject: re:how long should it take

was writ:

"2 AB 16c  Replace complete front panel (cut out or straighten damaged
parts,
weld in new parts and smooth out; remove and install front bumper and
brackets, both headlights, windshield wiper bracket and motor, electrical
wiring, both doors, both windshields, mirror and front panal as necessary
2300 units (23 hours)"

if one unit = 3minutes, then 2300 units is more like 115 hours, or am i
doing something wrong?

[(2300 units) x (3 minutes/unit)] / (60 minutes/hour)
