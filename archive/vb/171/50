Subject: odd-looking cam gear....

hi all - i have an odd-duck cam gear i'd like some help identifying...
http://www.ckoon.org/gear.jpg


note that the bolt areas are drilled wide instead of deep, and the 
cuts deepen from one side to the other.
i'm guessing some sort of concentric washer thingy? or maybe just the 
way the drill bit cut the face?
note also the groove cut in the teeth (arrow) - this is cool, as it 
is to allow oil to be squished out a bit easier, resulting in some 
miniscule HP gain :)
berg grooves the teeth, but usually cuts two.


i'm looking for either a manufacturer or modifier's name (it is a 
stock vw113109111a gear), or at least a description of what kind of 
bolt/washer combo made it work and if they are still available. i 
might see if it mates up with my crank gear and use it for the hell 
of it.
