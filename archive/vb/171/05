Subject: 2 buses parting out 1967s- NOT MINE

Found two buses, a camper and dlx, both 67s being parted. Call
610-965-898, and ask for bill or tim. Located in eastern pa. Now you
know what I do. I saw them, some good metal, some glass, dlx trim,
chrome, westy pop top, westy rear seat, headlights. No guages or dlx
interior panels.
