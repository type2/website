Kevin-
Remove the fan belt and run the engine briefly
to isolate possible noise from the generator / fan.
If the noise is in the fan, remove it to see if it is
cracked. Otherwise, tin / shim adjustment will do.
Also check the tin in front of the crank pulley.
Third choice would be loose rocker hardware.
