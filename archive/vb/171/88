Subject: 009 Distributor Cap

I recently acquired a 66 bus.
In an effort to get it back original I ordered the Bosch ignition parts
for it.
The 009 will not accept the parts - they don't fit.
Cap # 1-235-522-027
Rotor #9-231-081332
Points #04006
If someone is running a 009 on a 1600 cc engine please tell me which part
numbers you are using.
