no. in the official VW time estimating repair books there 
are 100 units per hour. so 100 units equals one hour, and each individual unit 
is 0.6 minutes.

"2 AB 16c  Replace complete front panel (cut out or straighten

parts,

weld in new parts and smooth out; remove and install front bumper and

brackets, both headlights, windshield wiper bracket and motor, 
electrical

wiring, both doors, both windshields, mirror and front panal as 
necessary

2300 units (23 hours)"

 

if one unit = 3minutes, then 2300 units is more like 115 hours, or am 
i

doing something wrong?

 

[(2300 units) x (3 minutes/unit)] / (60 
minutes/hour)
