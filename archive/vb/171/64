Subject: [VB] Wanted: Side, Rear Window Seals for Fastback

Thanks for the information!  Can anyone tell me what the name of the 
business is that Bill and Steve run?  Perhaps the contact information?

Thanks much

Great place IF you get the counter guy that knows something!  There is
one kid there that literally barely knows his head from a hole in the
ground.  Nice guy, but WOW!  It took him 30 minutes to get the brake
lines, brake cyl. rebuild kits and fuel hose he had in stock.  20
minutes of F'ing around looking up part numbers to fill out an invoice.

BTW I've been told those seals are VERY hard to find...if at all.
