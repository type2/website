Subject: RE: [VB] rattle ?

actually i probably forgot to post-i pout a new header, and muffler, as well
as patched some holes in the heater boxes.

my neighbor who was with me thought it was the muffler, like maybe a nut or
bolt was loose in there, or it was possible ratling against something. but i
haven't put the rear bumper on yet, and when i touch the muffler the noise
doesn't change. maybe the cam? is the oil pump connected directly to the
cam? if so maybe i did something when installing the oil pump/filter thing.

i am hoping to go over to my cousins(a mechanic) he has this stethoscope
thing with a rod on the end. you touch the rod to different parts of the
engine to locate where noises are coming from.

i'll post any info i find.

That sounds kinda like what my motor is doing.  I've asked like 8 people
about it, and 7 have said that's the exhaust hitting on something.  I've
looked everywhere, and it's not the exhaust.  The other person, and
professional air-cooled VW mechanic, said it was probably the cam.  Does the
rattle sound like the exhaust hitting on the bumper or some other object???
The only difference is that when I increase the RPM's only slightly, the
sound does get faster, but after like 1300-1500 RPM's, the sound of the
motor drowns it out.
