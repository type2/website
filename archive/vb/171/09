-i just found this in the archive...


<< Could anybody help me out and tell me the torque setting for the
 crankshaft pulley on a 1600 sp, stocker ? >>

first from adrian:
32 ft-lb of torque per Tom Wilson in his book "How To Rebuild Your
Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine".  A very fine book that has helped me build
two wonderful motors.

then from eric&Barb:
Hi Woody,
Our 1966 "Without Guess Work"  booklet shows 3.0-4.0 mkg or 22-29 ft lbs.
Of
course this would be for the 1500, but should be the same for the 1600!
