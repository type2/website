Boat folks have been dealing with this issue for ages.
----------------- Bedding Compound ----------------
Most auto parts stores can supply various caulking that is used for
sealing automotive.
I purchase the black tape that is used for insulating Refrigerated lines.
It is soft and conforms to just about any shape,  also sticks to itself
very well. 
From the Auto store it comes in 18" lengths but Air Conditioning supply
house sell big rolls (my outside pipes are wrapped at the valves and
solder joints with it).
Might be just the ticket, you can roll it down to thin from the original
1/8" thickness.
