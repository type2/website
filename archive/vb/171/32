Subject: Re: [VB] 40hp heads

Thanks for the generous offer, but I am going to hold out for a 113 101 371F (or
a pair of 113 101 373 no suffixes if those come along first). I'm not in a
hurry, I wouldn't be building a 40hp motor if I were... As far as I can tell
these are the only two 40hp heads with original short rocker arm studs, and to
me that is worth having.
Localish VW dismantler says they sell "gauranteed rebuildable" heads for $35 a
piece. Funny gaurantee.
