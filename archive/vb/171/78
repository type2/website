I know I'll need new gas line, air cleaner and some engine tin..... I know...

Heat exchangers are in... I've got a picture from underneath too and there you can see heat
exchangers connected....I uploaded that picture too....
But there are no fresh air connections up on top. I need to go back to stock, unplug and connect
hoses. I'm thinking now about heat... need to check how everything looks underneath since heat tube
inside was cut off. I have someone local that offered me this tube but me? I'm thinking about
installing something different... perhaps a heater in the engine compartment? I don't know... I'm
thinking wild and in the meantime.... I drive it. It's nice! beautiful weather...perfect for "Drive
your Bus to work - everyday".
