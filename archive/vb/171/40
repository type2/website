Subject: Re: [VB] Double Cab Wood Slats

Boat folks have been dealing with this issue for ages.  A good quality marine bedding compound ought to be just the ticket.  Marine bedding compounds are designed to stay flexible and watertight at all temps. while exposed to deluges of salt and fresh water.  Check with the marine supply of your choice, tell them what you're doing and ask for suggestions.  

I'm skeptical about the wisdom of rivets combining dissimilar metals, as mentioned in another post.  Seems like a setup for electrolytic corrosion [AKA 'electrolysis'].  Actually 3 different metals when you factor in the steel of the bed.

I'm just about to put wood slats in the rear of my Double Cab.  I will be  riveting them on and will be putting clear silicone on the bottom  of the  slats around the rivets to prevent water from dripping down the holes.
