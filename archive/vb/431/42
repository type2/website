I started using anti-seize on plugs after reading in the VW Bentley
workshopmanual not to install them dry.
The mid 70-s beetle version, that covers the 1600 dp engines. orange
cover
iirc

If you're installing NOS mid-seventies plugs with bare steel threads,
use
anti-seize...Almost all current plugs have plated threads to prevent
galling
and seizing in alloy heads. Anti-seize on the threads changes the torque
values..
Porsche tech bulletin 9120, Group 2, Identifier 1870 recommends not to
use anti-seize...
