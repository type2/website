Subject: Re: [T2] battery disconnect

Hi Bob,

Could you explain what you mean by "make before break"?

With your two battery setup, do you mean you have two shut-off switches?

My '65 has a generator and my '69 has an alternator. I will probably put a
switch in both. I don't plan on using it to turn power off while the engine
is running, I only planned on using it when storing for long periods of
time, and whenever I need to diagnose an electrical issue, and don't like
going back and forth hooking the ground strap up, and disconnecting the
ground strap.
