My thoughts, if you go thru your brakes completely: hoes, springs, wheel
cylinders, drums turned true, new hoses, master cylinder, your Bus will
stop on a dime.

Now, if I was running some crazy hot motor and going down the highway at
80mph, then I could see the need for disc brakes.

But me, I'm a huge believer in these things were over engineered in the
beginning, so why mess with a good thing.

Good luck!
Gary
