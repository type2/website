Subject: re:Bus Cover

Hey guys,

 

I got that bus cover from bus depot as well. The ability to get in the bus
without having to take the cover off is nice. I often leave the cover on,
and may go in to grab some tool or something that I left in there. Also to
start it up is nice.

 

It is a little tricky to put on, and keep clean (ie not drag it on the
ground). A 2nd person makes install a breeze. This would happen with any
cover.
