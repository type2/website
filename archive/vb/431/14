Subject: Re: [T2] battery disconnect

Probably not the most popular idea, but if I am working on something 
frequently I just leave the clamping bolt on one of the battery 
terminals a bit loose.  Since I keep my terminals clean and liberally 
coated with vasoline, I can easily remove and install one with a quick 
twist.  If you do it this way it really doesn't matter which terminal  
you leave loose, just remember though that using a wrench on the 
positive terminal (when the negative is connected) is dangerous.

So for those of you who have installed these-any suggestions? Should I 
hook this up to the ground or the positive? Initially I thought the 
ground, but was not really sure why. I am looking at installing the 
'flaming river" little battery disconnect, I like that it comes with a 
mounting bracket. Which I think should make it easy to install. -Kevin
