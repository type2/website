Subject: Thanksgiving Misgivings campout reminder - OVT style

Just a reminder!!!
 
Allright Y'all,

It's official, we will be hosting the
official Ohio Valley Tribe Thanksgiving
Misgivings campout at the Bakerosa in
Pleasant Plain, Ohio (just north of
Cincinnati) on the weekend of December
2-3. 
...
We will be doing traditional Thanksgiving dinner on Saturday night,
around 6-ish. Everyone is welcome to come in on Friday and stay for the whole
weekend or feel free to just come for dinner on Saturday. If the weather is
forgiving we will have a big ole fire both nights (well, we'll have a big ole
fire regardless). And if you are scared of camping outdoors in your bus during
December, then there is plenty of floor
space in the house and in the old
schoolhouse to crash.

I think Frank B committed to cooking the bird (we've
already bought a 25 pounder and we'll thaw it too!) So you can choose to bring
a side, or not, doesn't matter. 
Anyway, let us know if you plan on coming,
that way we can plan the menu accordingly!
 
Our address is:
9921 State Route
132
Pleasant Plain, OH 45162


PEACE! 
John Baker




"...So we got in the red
VW microbus with the
shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and
headed on toward the
police officer's station..."

PEACE!
