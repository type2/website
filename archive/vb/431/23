Subject: Re: [VB] battery disconnect

I looked into these, and the idea looks good on the one that mounts directly
to the battery, if you don't want to lose your radio info-but it looks like
it doesn't really kill your battery connection. I did not like that idea. I
wanted to turn it off or on. 

 

I also wasn't sure about the quality of that green knob-would it still be ok
to turn it on and off over time, is I couldn't tell it was quarter turn or
something you needed to turn a lot to disconnect. 

 

The blade type looks cool, but I think there is too much stuff exposed, I
didn't like that.

 

Was writ:

I was thinking the type that mounts right on the battery would be nice,
simple to install and effective.

 

Does anyone have good or bad experiences with using these types? 

There seem to be both blade type and a green knob type.
