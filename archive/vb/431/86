Hey Kevin,

The reason that you cannot use the car body as an antenna, is that the 
body is the ground in that system. connecting the antenna terminal to 
the body will simply short the antenna input.

If you can't find an antenna, strip about a 1/2 inch off the end of a 
3-4 foot insulated wire and stuff the stripped end into the center of 
the antenna connector on the radio, taking care that it only touches 
the center part of the connector as the outer part is ground and if 
you short the two, no radio signal will enter the radio. Route the 
wire out from under the dash and up the window and see if that helps 
the reception. If it does, then you have a bad antenna.
Is this on your 69 or your 65? I forget.
