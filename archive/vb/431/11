Subject: battery disconnect

I am finally going to install one of those battery disconnects in my bus and
truck.

 

I like the idea of this for working on the bus-it makes electrical work much
easier, instead of disconnecting with a socket and reconnecting with a
socket while testing electrical stuff out, I can just use a little plastic
key. Plus I can disconnect it when not driving for a long time-so my radio
does not drain the battery (yeah I have one of those new fangled radios).

 

So for those of you who have installed these-any suggestions? Should I hook
this up to the ground or the positive? Initially I thought the ground, but
was not really sure why.

 

I am looking at installing the 'flaming river" little battery disconnect, I
like that it comes with a mounting bracket. Which I think should make it
easy to install.
