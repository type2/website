Subject: "A star is born"... or at least it's first feature!

Snap to!!!

Everybody run right off to your nearest newstand and snap up the Feb 2012
issue of Hot VWs!!!  There in the middle of my current "Transporter Talk"
column all about the 1957 model year for Transporters on page 23 is a four
shot "mini-feature" showing Kent's awesome freshly restored '57 Sunroof
Standard!  Bummer they couldn't squeeze in my suggested captions to credit his
ownership, but at least they got four shots in there (and for the first time
in over 80 columns bumped me out into three columns).

Congratulations again to Kent and all who assisted him in building the
"bitchen-est Bus in St. Louis!
