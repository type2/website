Subject: RE: [T2] battery disconnect

That sounds pretty neat, I have never heard of such a switch. Do you have a
link to one online? I don't thinkI need that in my bus, but I am interested
in it...maybe some future upgrade. I have thought about a 2nd battery for
camping-but have never really needed it. What do you run it on when driving
around-just one battery, and with it set for 2 batteries, are they set p in
series or parallel? Ie can you set it to maintain 12 V and not jump to 24V?

since it is a rotary switch it has 4 positions off.
battery #1
battery #2
or both batteries

when I am camping for example I will often switch off battery #1 and then I
don't risk running down at least one battery so there is sufficient 
power to start the engine.   I have the switch mounted to the top of the 
engine compartment near the air intake/filter, on the same bracket next to
the rotary switch is a momentary contact switch for starting the engine.
