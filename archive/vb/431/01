Subject: Rust preventative, coupon

Hi,

For all you folks on the list who are de-rusting your bus, I have a 10% off 
coupon from KBS Coatings I can p-mail to you. Send me a p-mail and I will 
send.

Anyone have experience to share regarding the products?
I don't. Just passing along information and hoping to help.

Regards,
Chris
