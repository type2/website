I have used their gas tank sealing kit for two separate tanks now, and have
so far been well pleased. Both are holding up fine a couple years down the
road with no issues. One was from a VW Thing, the other an old Ford tractor.
I've never used any of their other products, but they do have good prices
and customer service for what I have used.
