My friends,

Many years ago, we had a storyteller in the VW community. You may have  
heard of him. Bob Hoover (no, not the airplane guy. The other one.)  
Bob could really spin a tale.  He also was reasonably knowledgeable in  
things mechanical. If you are inclined, you can read a bunch of his  
stuff here: <http://bobhooversblog.blogspot.com/>

Every year, I would write Bob and ask his permission to repost the  
following. It got to the point where he would send permission before I  
remembered that it was time to ask.  We lost Bob a year and a half  
ago. I can't ask anymore.  I miss that.

I don't have his permission to post on these lists, just on  
WetWesties, but I don't think Bob would mind that I pointed to his  
blog entry.

Go read a story.  Read it aloud to your kids.  They WILL remember. (http://badgopher.com/search/hoover
