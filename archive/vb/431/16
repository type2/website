I have a Boat type rotary switch, make before break means that the new 
position is "made" before the old position is "Broken"

since it is a rotary switch it has 4 positions
off.
battery #1
battery #2
or both batteries

when I am camping for example I will often switch off battery #1 and then 
I don't risk running down at least one battery so there is sufficient 
power to start the engine.   I have the switch mounted to the top of the 
engine compartment near the air intake/filter, on the same bracket next to 
the rotary switch is a momentary contact switch for starting the engine.
