I'd give it cool as hell, but it did feel sort of cheated that the video went
from
futilely cranking, cranking, cranking, then cut to running.  Made me
wonder
if you managed to singe your eyebrows off during the missing "18
minutes."
At least the fire extinguisher was close at hand.  I bet you can
polish out the
shroud and have it looking spiffy without a repaint.
 
How does
the overrun on the hand crank work (aside for well apparently.)
 
John
