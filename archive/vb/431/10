Subject: Electrical Accessories...just sharing....

This past weekend I did some electrical tinkering on my bus. I installed a
couple barrier strips (one for grounding and one for power). I used these to
power a 12V accessory plug, so I can charge my cellphone, and also power my
Retrosound Radio.

 

Here is a pic of it. I liked the idea of this, so I could charge my phone as
I use the GPS function on it a lot, and my phone kept dying. I also
installed one of those retrosound radios, which has a USB, SD and 3.5 mm
jack inputs. I sued double sided sticky foam tape to adhere these to under
the dash. You can also see the barrier strips I used for connecting these. I
have one for grounds, and a fused connection for the accessories.
