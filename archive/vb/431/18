Subject: Re: [T2] battery disconnect

For many years I have used the not quite tight style on my positive 
terminal. I can give it a twist and remove it without resorting to a wrench. 
To install I usually give it a light tap or two with a block of wood. Of 
course the terminal needs to be clean for this to work. Very convenient I 
find.
