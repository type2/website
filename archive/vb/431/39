I've often wondered if the anti seize helped or hindered.
Clearly if you use too much, it's bad. In airplanes it is 
recommended, but it's graphite based and has particular restrictions:

Where it says:
Apply sparingly to second and third threads. Do not contact 
electrodes as it could short out the plug.

My airplane mechanic advised that it can burn if it's on the first 
thread and then the carbon of the burnt compound can damage the 
threads in the head when you remove the plug.
