Hi Kevin,

I like the double sticky tape idea. Makes for an easy and reliable 
attachment without holes. I have several tapped holes in my dash tray for 
mounting things like loudspeakers. I use custom shortened screws that don't 
protrude. Takes a lot of grind and try to get just the right length. 
Typically I use size 10-32, thats 5mm for you guys across the pond.
