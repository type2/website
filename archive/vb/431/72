Subject: Had a Type II between 1960-1980? Tell your stories for a

Hi,

Ibm a Ph.D. student at Emory University in Atlanta, working
on a
dissertation on youth travel in the 1960s and 1970s.B  VWs are a big part of
that history, and
Ibm hoping some folks on this list might want to share
their memories and
stories.

Ibm looking for people who owned, worked on, or
traveled in
a Type II between 1960 and 1980.B B  Among other things, Ibm
interested in how and why you got your bus; your
experiences customizing
and/or working on it;B  your traveling experiences;B  your opinion of John
Muirbs bIdiotbs Guideb; and how your
experiences with a bus played
into the rest of your life.
So if youbve got tales to tell, this is your
chance. B B I really do think this is a
significant part of American cultural
history and want to hear what you have to
say.

Herebs how it would work:B 
If youbre willing to participate, send me an e-mail at
bbrazil AT emory DOT
edu.B  Ibll
send you a survey, which you can fill out and send back to me.B 
If youbd rather not type out your
answers, I can also just interview you by
phone.B B  In some cases, I may ask to follow up by phone
anyway.B  You can
chose whether you
want me to use your real name or be anonymous.B  If you
donbt mention it, Ibll leave you anonymous.B B B  

Site adminstrators
have given me the go-ahead to post this
query, but have asked for replies to
be off-site.B  When this project is finally done, though, Ibll make sure to
send a link so anyone can read it whobs interested.

Again, your stories
will help me finish my dissertation and
hopefully will wind up in a book on
travel culture in the 60s and 70s.B B  I hope to hear from lots of you,
and I
appreciate any help I can get.B  

Thanks,
Ben Brazil
