Subject: Anyone know how Kelly Brown (Metwiz) is doing?

Just random thought today made me search for Kelly.   I recall a couple years
back he was having health issues (sounded like a life of body work catching up
to him) and was sort of semi-retiring.  His old domain metwiz.com just points
to a for sale add, and I was wondering if anyone knows how he is, what he is
up to.  Google can't find anything more recent than '09 about him, hope he is
at least alive.
