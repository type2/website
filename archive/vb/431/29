"The purpose of this post is one thing, for everyone to get the straight 
info from the source, me. Due to health issues I'm backing out of the 
restoration, fabricating, welding profession. I may do some on a small 
scale till I find a job or figure out what I'm going to do. At this point 
I have no idea what's next. "
