Subject: Bus Depot Now Hiring

The Bus Depot, Inc. has an opening for a customer service rep in
Perkiomenville, PA (roughly midpoint between Philly, Allentown, and
Reading).  Benefits include group health insurance, a retirement plan once
you've been with us for a year, and of course VW parts at cost!  This is an
entry level position.  If you have good customer service skills and are a
Volkswagen enthusiast, we can train you from there. Email me a bit about
yourself if interested, or if you know someone else who might be, please
pass it on.

Thanks,

- Ron Salmon
