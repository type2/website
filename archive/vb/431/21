got it from West marine  part # 3831393
a Blue Seas part # 9001E

costs about $45 but is very well made.

I have both batteries wired in parallel so can use both for starting. 
have the second battery on the other side in the same position fits very 
well.   use big 59 series batteries with 950CCA but they are not deep 
cycle batteries but regular car start batteries.

could send you directly a photo of my mount.    did this in conjunjuction 
with replacing all my battery wiring with waterproof marine wiring and 
fittings, cost about $200 overall, also used a larger size wire than VW.
and color coded the wire while I was at it.  totally eliminated all the 
hassles with bad grounds etc.
