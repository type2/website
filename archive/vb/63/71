Subject: Re: [VB] What ever happened to the five hundred dollar bus?

being somewhat of an ex-parts "whore", i made an ok existence scouring the
country for junkyards to strip cars. i never had the $$ to do the entire
vehicle thing. some blame must be placed on the internet, obviously, and
the fact that there just aren't as many anywhere as there were 5 or so
years ago, not even in junkyards. 
i still don't sell parts for what people say they are "worth", because i'm
still of the frame of mind i'd rather see people get the part that need the
part, rather than attend a swap meet and see what everyone has on "display"
for insane money. 
yes, money i make does go to tools and trinkets. i just got a practically
nos VW131A today via ups. it's a matra german bushing driver for bus center
pin bushings! can't wait to use it and try out that reamer! and that hazet
catalog never seems to go away...........
$500 busses/old vw's do exist, but $500 10 years ago isn't the same $500
today. plus anymore, most $500 vehicles are usually only good for parts.
unfortunate but true.
