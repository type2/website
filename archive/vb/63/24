Subject: Bus Rescue/no Pomona-WW open house

     Looks like I won't be able to make Wolfsberg West open house or Pomona
this weekend, looks like I'm going on a bus rescue mission on Saturday (bus
has been impounded and the owners can't get it out). As much I hoped to make
these events saving a 1960 DD panel is more important. See you all at Buses
by the Bridge VI, January 18,19 and 20, 2002.
