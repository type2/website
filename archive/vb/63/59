Subject: Re: [VB] What ever happened to the five hundred dollar bus?

i bought my 1956 single cab from someone who might be called a vw whore except that i bought my truck cheap!  $800 got me a complete truck lacking only an engine and a third of the bed (donor bed thrown in the deal though).  three or so years later, my truck is a trophy bus with two trophies to show for itself.  my fav is "best splitwindow single cab" from bbbv.

by high dollar cali (at least that's what i hear from some non-residents) standards i also got my 1956 sunroof pretty cheap.  i paid something like $1000 - $1200 (don't recall as too many years have passed) for that basket case now driver.

i think deals and cheap buses are still out there.  jp has loads of stories about getting buses cheap.  my favorite is the one about the cuban buses.

cheers,
