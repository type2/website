Dear wise list,
 
Having just picked up my set of 15" wheels from getting sandblasted, it
is much easier to see the date stamps on them. From that, I have a
question.
 
The dates that I have are:
1/61 (x1)
5/60 (x3)
10/58 (x1)
 
The wheels from '60 and '61 are the same, but the '58 wheel has ridges
between the lugnut holes and the hubcap retaining clips. Does anyone
know when they switched from this style to the smooth style? I checked
the archive with no luck.
 
Thanks,
~Rich
