===============

Personally, I don't think the sealant will affect the
ground enough to matter.  But it isn't a good idea to
use teflon tape in any situation where a loose bit of
tape could plug or block an oil passage, so I would us
Loctite teflon sealant or other teflon pipe thread
sealing paste, not tape.
