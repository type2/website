As Eric and Barb said it is not that big of a deal.  Their is one thing 
though worth mentioning.  Empi sells a quick shift kit for bugs, sells for 
around $6 for the metal ones.  It's basically a set of spacers.  Anyway the 
works great on buses, split or Bay.  This kit really tightens up the shift 
pattern.  Giving your bus that high performance feel.  It also helps those of 
us that have short arms (myself included).  Another cool thing is these 
spacers don't show, they do lift up the floor mat a little, but you wouldn't 
know it unless you were looking for it.   This modification has one of the 
best fun to money ratio I've ever run across.  Well, worth the time and the 6 
bucks.
                                                                        
Peace,
