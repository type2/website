My crew cab has bug IRS.  I have had the 914 rear disc brake kit sitting
around for a long time.  For those VW addicts on the list, I bought the
kit from Small Car Specialties, Kent himself as I recall.  It consists
of:

	2 new 914 calipers w/e-brake hooks
	2 type 3 rear hubs
	2 914 rear discs
	2 CNC caliper mounts

I drilled and studded them for fuchs alloys.  Without adapters, I'm able
to fit a 205/55VR16 tire (on 16x6) under the fender.
