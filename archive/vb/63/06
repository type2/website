Subject: how fast...

in the t2 library, under tires, there is a link for a tire/gearbox/rpm
calculator... on the 70, i have 205/75/14 if i remember right, it says 4000
rpm will get me 69.25 mph. i made a chart in color and keep it in the car -
i need to make it a transparent overlay for the tach!

one a you math wizzos should be able to tell us how to factor  the redux
boxes into the formula.

i KNOW how fast the s/c goes... 0 to 0 in 20 years!
