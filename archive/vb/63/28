Subject: Re: [T2] Unidentified old gas heater(I think)

You have a South Wind gas heater that is 6volt, but can be converted to 12.

Last spring, I put on a gasoline heater seminar for the KC Kombies.
Out of the research I did, I found that parts to service the heaters were
hard to find, so I decided to deal South Wind heater parts myself.  I
choose to handle the South Wind parts because these heaters are easy to
find, work on and get parts for.  Not to say the Eberspacher's aren't good
heaters, some will say they are the best, but the South Winds have more
parts available.

If you need South Wind service parts, go to:
http://pages.prodigy.net/busbarn/southwind.html

Now if you are hesitant about working on your own heater, or are curious
about how it works, the seminar video and manuals can be a great help.
This is one satisfied customer's testimonial:

"As I stated before, had it not been for your video and making the manual
and parts available, the heater would still be on the garage floor.  I was
going to post the success on the T-2 list, but then the price of used
heaters will shoot up at shows.  I want to get a few more before folks find
out about how reliable and useful they really are."

If you would like a video or manual, the information below will help you.
