I haven't tried to find the top end on my Bus yet.  I got it into
Fourth without lugging it once, so that was probably 45 MPH or so.
Even though I have replaced the brake lines, hoses, and master
cylinder, there are still some things that need attention before
I start trying to break any land speed records.
