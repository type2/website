Where'd you have it done?  Was that all they did?  It looks like a
new carb will be $100 to $120.  I can see spending $30 on my current
carb, but I can't really see spending $75.

At this point I've got to clean the carb anyway.  I might just put
a new gasket kit on it and fake up some temporary "throttle shaft 
seals" with RTV (per a past Bob Hoover post) - enough to put it on
the engine and run it for a bit to see if there is any improvement.
If that improves it markedly, then it's probably time to have the
throttle shaft fixed right.  If it doesn't improve then it might be
time for a carb.

"Flat" is probably not as important (there is a gasket there) as
"concentric" but I think that's what you meant: there is a smooth
bore all the way down the carb with no "step" or "lip" where the
air horn - main body joint is.
