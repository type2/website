Subject: RE: [T2] Looking for the widest tire I can fit on my stock 1970 1

Was writ:
"I am looking to buy a wider tire, for both looks and I plan on using the
truck on the farm in a few months............. 
Adam P" 

The wider tire can be an issue since the most common load rated tire is only
a 195 width.  Especially for work use you will want at least a "C" load
rating.  I put passenger "P" load rated tires on my '71 Chevy truck from 8
plys and the "P" tires plain old suck, squishes all over when any weight is
in it!

The best I could find was a 215/75R14 Goodyear Marathon Radial from
TireRack.com for $63 each.  Granted this is a highway rib which may not be
good for off road farming?   

Previous ramblings by me on the Vintage bus list which could be helpful.
Someone e-mailed me a warning on the Cooper tires lawsuit so be careful on
them:

If you are in the market for 14" rims or a different choice for the 15"
check out the Cooper tires. Thanks to Greg McKinney for putting me on the
Cooper trail.  These should priced pretty fairly.

and this for "D" load 14"s in 185 and 195!!!

And here are the traditional recommendations:
-Yokohama Y360  http://www.yokohamatire.ca/main/index.htm
-Bridgestone 603V available in "C" and "D" load ranges for 14" 185/195.  
-Kumho seems to have a bunch of possibilities in the 852 (only 14" but "D"
load), 824 Venture HT (15" only, "C" load), and 825 Venture AT (15" only,
"C" load). http://www.kumhotireusa.com/pages/lt_main.htm  I have been very
very pleased with a set of ECSTA Supra 712 tires, so I may have to look into
these options.
-Michelin http://tires.michelin-us.com/  For the money they do not seem as
good as some lower cost options.  The max load weight seems low for what you
are paying for.


Good Luck,
