The thing people forget about the " Parts Whores" is that if it wasn't for
them alot of those busses they found would still be sitting where they were
*rusting* away.  Many of the salvage yards I have gone to looking for busses
say "Yeah we used to have 5 or 6 of them but we crushed them all a few years
ago"  Wish a "Whore" could have made it there first to put a few of those
irreplaceable parts back in circulation.
