Hi Bob,
If your speedo is fairly correct it sounds like you have a badly geared 
tranny.  Possibly a 4.387 R&P bug tranny!  You would save enough $$ in better 
MPG by getting your cruising RPM down to 3,000 RPM to pay for a 4.125 R&P or 
freeway flier 3.875 R&P tranny in less than 50,000 miles and have longer 
engine life to boot.
