Subject: Welding on sheet metal.

Hi,

I am getting closer to the point where I will be putting the nose back onto
my bus. What kind of prep is recommended in the seam areas. The metal is
lightly coated with rust. I am planning to
1. sand blast, then etch and paint with zinc primer before welding.
2.  Is this OK? What will the zinc primer do to the welds?
3. Should I find a spot welder on ebay? rather than using a mig welder? I
need to fill in the drilled out spot welds too.

TIA!!
