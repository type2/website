    Hi all!
       I got my 62 Kombi from a friend for 475.00 about 2 years ago. It was 
pretty original and came with the full length roof rack. It needed alot of 
work but I was glad to get it! There are virtually no split Busses here at 
all, and the ones that do turn up are pretty rusted out or have hackjob 
bodywork done to them. The same friend I got my 62 from found a 57 23 window 
a couple of towns over and got it for 900 bucks complete! I also got the 54 
Standard I mentioned before (Vintagebus.com Hall of Shame feature Bus, 
woohoo!) They're out there, but you have to really look good!
