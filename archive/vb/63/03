Subject: Gearshift question


Howdy. My gearshift is all screwed up. First Gear is not where it is 
supposed to be and neither is reverse or any of the other gears. All the 
gears work fine but they are not where they are supposed to be. For reverse 
all I have do is go straight down from first..no locking or anything. The 
person I got the bus from told me the PO(before him) installed it 
incorrectly. How difficult would it be for me to fix this  myself? Before I 
get into this I'd appreciate any feedback anyone can offer. It is driving me 
crazy. Half the time It takes me several minutes to even find first gear! 
HELP!! Thanks! Please email me at
gregwcarter(-at-)hotmail.com if you can help.
