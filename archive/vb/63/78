I think unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is usually more common than
shielded.  It doesn't really matter for this application, though.
There is a grade called "plenum" cable which has a thicker, flame-
retardant jacket (it's meant to be safely run through building
air ducts) which would probably do even better in a Bus.

One important thing.  The individual wires in this cable are very
tiny - a sample I have here has 24 AWG wires.  Gauge senders should
be OK with it, but don't use this cable to suppply anything that
draws any kind of power (lights, etc).  I think the smallest gauge
VW used for anything was 0.8 mm^2 which is about 18 AWG - four times
the cross-sectional area of 24 AWG.

Eric&Barb (I think) have suggested "trailer cable" if you need to
run a few heavier leads at once.  This is four or more larger wires
(16 AWG - 14 AWG) bundled into a round jacket.  If you only need
three wires, regular stranded power cord will work - try to get
a high-temperature type like HPN.  (The temperature rating will
be printed in degrees Celsius on the jacket.  105C is probably
the highest easily-available rating.)  This is stranded flexible
cord, like extension cords are made from - NOT solid nonmetallic
sheathed cable or "Romex", UF, etc.
