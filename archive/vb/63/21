OH NO, here we go again!

ps. I think you (Dave) needs to get a permanent swap spot at Pomona and just
make the trip to each one. A great place for AR nuts, bolts and to used to
use parts at bargain basement prices.

When I bought the tipper, I promised my wife and several friends that the
tipper was going to be a 'work' truck.... or at least to be used, unlike the
'59 dc keep it in a bubble mobile'.  However, I have committed myself to at
least replace parts that *need* or require fixing with og parts.

Some day, when you stand before the AR-judge, you'll weep as those
words are read back to you...

(in jest, of course...)
