Subject: seat stand rubber mat wanted

Hi All,

Anyone have a nice original Seat Stand Rubber Mat they would want to sell?
The pieces remaining in the tipper continue to flake off.  Good used and
functional is all I ask for here, small tears ok, just not disintegrating
like mine!

Let me know.

David
