Subject:  the five hundred dollar bus?....two bays 4sale...250 each or 400 for both

I have a 70 and 71 bus. Both decent condition but need engines. The 70 is 
from Arizona, but Im located in North Central Florida. This weekend 
only...250 each or 400 for both. Just trying to make a little room. There 
are ads on TheSamba if you would like a picture.
