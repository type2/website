Subject: RE: [VB] seat stand rubber mat wanted

When I bought the tipper, I promised my wife and several friends that the
tipper was going to be a 'work' truck.... or at least to be used, unlike the
'59 dc keep it in a bubble mobile'.  However, I have committed myself to at
least replace parts that *need* or require fixing with og parts.

Some day, when you stand before the AR-judge, you'll weep as those
words are read back to you...

(in jest, of course...)
