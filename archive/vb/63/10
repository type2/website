yea, the speedo is correct, ive checked it with my GPS... whatever tranny is 
under there, like i said is smooth and quiet, but otherwise SUCKS!

just done know what to do... not too many people to help around here, and i 
dont know if im confident enough to drop the tranny. i have a drum to drum 
big nut, but it grinded a bit when downshifting.
