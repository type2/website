Yes, most walk-thrus had a 2/3 middle seat but you can just check the flo=
or
mounts to see what is proper or check the holes in your original cargo fl=
oor
rubber mat, if you still have it.  Real floor mounts are welded-in, as yo=
u
indicated.

The 62-63 2/3 middle seat is fairly difficult to find, although you could=

always fake it by using a 64-65 seat and switching the grab handles.

I also have a full-length 62-63 seat that I would trade for a short one..=
.

'67 seats have the kicked-out leg near the cargo doors.  '66 had this too=
?
 I'm not sure on that.
