Subject: More starter probs...

Thanks to all that replied to my first questions. I have one  more...Sorry..
Please see pics at:
http://www.geocities.com/my65kombi/photo.htm When I try to drive the old
bushing out, do I run the chance of breaking the area that holds the
bushing??? The walls were shaved quite thin.
I couldn.t just leave it alone, could I? I assume the bushing should be
fairly snug around the starter shaft?

Thanks Again,
Michael Moore
