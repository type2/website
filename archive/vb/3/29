Subject: Small nut redux bearings

 Hi List,

 I know this info is in the archives but I am not able to get the search
 result page for some reason. What I need are the manufacturer's (ie.
Timney,
 SKF or whoever) codes for both bearings in the small nut redux box.

I am leaving on a road trip this morning so I will pick up any responses on
the
web reflector.

 TIF for any help

 Michael
