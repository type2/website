Subject: Re: [VB] Pertronix Ignitor

I run a Pertronix in my 912 B ('69).  I also use large diameter 'competition' 
wires
purchased at a VW show for $14.00.  I am several thousand miles into this 
ignition set and have observed an increase in clean-burn and performance in 
my 1.75 litre
road dominatrix.

The Pertronix instructions do mention keeping the "old points and condenser 
handy as a backup"...Probably good advice!

I am thinking of installing these devices on my Sixties era VWs, but will 
retain the 
removed devices as well.

Regards!
