Subject: wax and grease remover

  I went to auto zone today to find some wax and grease remover, but
after reading the label thought I'd see if there's something else I can
use prior to sanding/priming.  It had the standard warning about cancer ,
reproductive harm , etc. Is there a safe alternative to this stuff? My
body shop friend says they use regular 409 all pupose cleaner, is that
enough? What about simple green? 
  My second question is what kind of paint would look most like how a bus
looked when new?  It seems like base coat /clear coat urethane is too "
glassy " or wet looking compared to original paint buses.
