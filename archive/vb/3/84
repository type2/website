Subject: RANT Delete NOW! Keep it Stock

Quick rant follows Delete now!


I had a 1963 Split. Wasnt the first, might not be the last but I dont have 
it now. Traded for a 60 Bug. And I like the bug, and the bus has a good home 
(I hope).


Anyway, I always had a good attitude about my vws. I kept it simple, with 
mostly stock parts. I went to a 1641 once, with a single port and liked it 
alot (woohoo big mod for me).
My 63 had a 1600 single port that got me from point a to point b (and c and 
d etc) without a hiccup. That bus and the ones before it were bliss. They 
never broke down, I understood them.
So now I am working on my 70 bus. You know why you dont own one of those? My 
cv joints always get loose, and have now thrown grease everywhere, making a 
mess. The engine with the rear holder is annoying.

I have a 1776 and its a pain too. I had a 34pict carb (modified with a bored 
out barrell) and it screwed up and ran too rich. SO then I got talked into 
dual kadrons. Oh what another pain in my A&&. They dont run right, and 
require a big effort to get right. Oh sure, I can lay on it (when they want 
to work) and wow away I go, while I keep thinking about how my heads are 
going to crack anyway. SO many worrys.
And then I get guages and watch them do their thing and worry about oil 
pressure, oil temp, and rpms, and wonder why I watch them instead of the 
road.
My 63 never worried me so much. The single port heads dont crack, the pict 2 
carb didnt cause problems.
I still cant seem to get the duals set right, the bus sits and looks pretty, 
and is aggressive when it works, and I wonder is it worth it.

I looked at my bugs engine the other day (I have not driven it, and cant 
until I fix the tranny, cause its a welded diff) and saw the port and polish 
and the dual chevy springs and chevy valves, and thought to myself "whats 
the point?"
I want to BE somewhere, I am there.


I miss my splitty.........

Thank You.
I needed to get that off my mind.

1971 Super Beetle, going to be chopped apart.
1960 Bug. Very clean. How does a car go 41 years without getting a radio? 
1835 engine, 13.8 quarter mile. Very rust free, very nice looking. Has rossi 
headlights. Hate them, might look good in a splitty, any takers?
1970 Sundowner (weekender) Westy. Looking for a roof rack. And as I was 
talking about radios, how did this one not get an 8 track or something? 
Still has a working Saphire.
