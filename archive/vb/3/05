 Anyone out there know about this made in USA bike? Took one in trade and
want to find out what it is.  Looks around late 30's very early 40's. girls
style, triangle kick stand ID # 10321. Per internet last iver Johnson was
built in 1941, but who knows.
Old firestone tires on it, green and cream very faded paint. Pmail me,
thanks.
