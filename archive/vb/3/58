Subject: RE :  Ross Steering Box!

Hello Everyone

    I was just under the bus looking at my steering box and then I looked at
this Ross steering box and they look the same. What I have found out so far
is that Ross is now part of TRW on their web page they have a picture of a
new beetle. My Neighbor is a mechanic and he told me that Ross steering
boxes were relatively common in big trucks. I guess this is just another one
for the VW history book  I will install this hopefully soon and let you know
how it works. Is 80/90w Gear oil fine to put in this box?
