I have a wife like that too.  She says I must sell my
55 single cab and 66 Beetle to compensate for the 56
Packard I just bought.  She even made me put it in
writing.  Those buses sounded really cheap so what you
must do is this:  Convince your wife that you are
buying this DC an an INVESTMENT and that you can flip
it and make some money.  Put a for sale sign on it to
appease her and put in a couple of ads with an
insanely high price.  After it doesnt sell and time
passes the wife will get used to seeing the DC around
and eventually forget that it was for sale.  It will
work, but wives are usually smarter than we give them
credit for and this trick will fly only once so be
sure to only use this technique on a vehicle that you
absolutely "have to have".  Once you have blown your
nut, its over.
