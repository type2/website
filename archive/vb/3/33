Subject: backfire!!

Wicked general question, but what causes these?  I go out and start the
motor twice a week in my 65 Camper which is awaiting a resto.  Last week, it
started to rev very high at idle (1700rpm), and now this week, it also
started backfiring.  They are little ones, and quite frequent, but right
before I turned the motor off, one of them made me jump out of my seat.

I'm stuck in that place where, the motor runs well, oil pressure, and
compression are good, and I would love to get the thing registered and drive
it around a bit, but I have no idea on the history of the motor.  PO knows
nothing about the ppo, and van last drove on the road in 99.  These recent
events are making me think I might as well pull the motor, and start from
scratch.  The fan shroud says "Powered by Go Fast VW", it has dual kadrons
on it, and I found a receipt from a dragstrip when I cleaned it out.
