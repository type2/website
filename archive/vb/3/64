Subject: FS 59 d-cab 64 westie; possibly 64-67 slider

I just spent yesterday at Ocean Shores. I played in the surf with my kayak
and a kite.
It was a perfect day for flying, overcast with 8-10 MPH winds and nice waves
to launch off of. Anyway on our way home last night we were driving through
Aberdeen and saw a 59 double cab for sale. Quickly Karen my wife grabs me
and states don't you even think about it! you have to many already, plus you
just spent $600.00 on a new kite today. Needless to say I was only able to
drive by it. Karen knows that if I get out and look at it then it is all
over and I would have to drag it home. So in looking at it from my double
cab as we slowly drive by it this is what I can tell you about it.

59 double cab looks to have a nice nose and rear corners some visible rust
at the bottom behind the cab, no rear bumper (unless it is in the bed), no
tail lights, bug type exhaust, gates, stock height, at least the top half of
the back seat is their though I would assume bottom and base is there too.
$1000.00 OBO

In the window of the double cab was a group of pictures of a 64 pop top
westy, looked like it was green and had the camp box in it. $400.00 OBO

A block down the road I noticed another split. It was sitting on the left
side of the road with it's wheel and rear window marked for it to be towed.
The interesting thing was that it was a 64-67 slider. It was red and white
and looked to be fairly complete.

Anyway I do not have phone numbers for any of this but I can tell you were
they were located.
The 59 DC with the pic of the 64 is located in a yard of a white house for
sale buy owner on Simpson and 28th in Aberdeen
the slider was located on Simpson and about 30th
Good luck! let us know if anyone on the list gets these.
