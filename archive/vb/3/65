Subject: Dormobile SO44 birthday present!

Wow~! Just when I thought that I was out of the VW
scene I was surprised with an all Velvet green
Dormobile SO44 for my birthday. Not a real Dormie but
one that was meticulously constructed and still in
need of a set of Ronnie's belly pans. Interior is
perfect as is the paint and body. I could not be
happier!

It's perfect and runs like a dream...

No, wait it is a dream. I was thinking of Rick
Crandall's fakey-Dormer that I could have bought for
$6500.00 at the last Summer SOTO meet but had already
shot my wad on the '54 Barnambulator which was to
arrive in Port Hueneme a few days following the meet.
The bus was later sold to parties in the East for a
figure to exceed what I mentioned.

I will settle for a new pair of shoes and a lovely
card  from my wife and daughter. I am pleased with
reality and cannot change the past. I like the
present. =)
