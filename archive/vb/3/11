here's the text:

Robert,

I own such a book, it is "How to adjust, repair and 
rebuild SOLEX 1 & 2 barrel downdraft carburetors for 
maximum performance."  It is published by Motorbooks 
International, PO Box 2, 729 Prospect Avenue, Osceola, 
Wisconson 54020.  Published in 1987.  
ISBN number 0-87938-253-8 (soft).

It was first published by Carbooks, Inc. in 1973.  
Don't know if it would have specific information 
for your particular application, but its general
information and diagrams are priceless.  
You might try your local book store with the ISBN number 
to see if its still in print.

Hope this helps!
