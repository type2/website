Hi Eric,
That will do fine or 85/90 or just plain old 90 Wt..  VW started to use 
grease instead of gear oil in thier gear boxes then found that at low temps 
the grease squeezedout of the gears in there and stuck to the side!  Leaving 
the gears to run dry.  So VW had to add kerosene to these boxes to keep the 
grease from doing this.  There is a reciepe somewhere in the archives for 
adding a STP thickener to prevent gear oil leakage from case of a leaky box 
or it's seal/s.   Eric&Barb
