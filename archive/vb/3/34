Subject: 6v / 12v Starter Question..

Hi Everyone, I am putting a 36hp in my early 59' bus (I know, I know)
Therefore, I am coverting it back to 6v. I know that there is some sort of
bushing to change, but I don't see it. Am I missing something? I took a
picture of the starters side by side.

The one on the right is a 6 volt, and the one on the left is the 12v. Can I
just bolt the 6v in??
Thanks in advance!
