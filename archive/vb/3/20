Subject: Mystery Bus revealed! (long)

Hey all...I've been getting a lot of email lately from people who=
 
read this article in the September VW Trends:

Well, you might recognize the description of a bus that was 
discovered on the list about a year ago. This is the infamous=
 Roach 
Coach/Lunchwagen/Catering Truck that Gary Lavere had for sale. I=
 
bought it off the list (from a fellow SV2s member) and it went 
through a number of stages of temporary living quarters (thanks=
 to 
Mario and Rachel). But, I finally brought it home to roost after=
 the 
BYOB weekend (also in that issue of Trends).

I'll be sending a note to Lois and Ryan with the updated info,=
 but 
thought I'd let the list in on it first.

After a lot of consideration I think I'll be swapping the=
 catering 
contents into a new donor bus. If I had my way, I'd move Kelly=
 MetWiz 
out to live in my back yard for a couple of months, but I don't=
 think 
he would go for that (Would you Kelly?). :) So, I picked up a 56=
 DD 
panel from listee and bus snob Jon Furst. It's not mint either,=
 but 
the price was extremely right and it's a LOT nicer than the LW 
itself.

By the way...the official title will be Lunchwagen, not Roach=
 Coach. 
Not that I have anything against Roach Coach...but I think of a=
 Roach 
Coach as being more of a stove inside sort of affair.

So...the plan of attack is to restore the donor bus, then do the=
 
transfer of the Lunchwagen materials. Then, I'll take the whole=
 thing 
up to a Catering Truck company and let them go through the works.=
 
Upgrade anything that needs it and then put it on the road as the=
 
Official Strictly Vintage 2s Lunchwagen.

I'm probably going to make it more of a 58 than a 56 since that's=
 
what the LW originally was. Essentially this means a taillight 
difference. Also, I will most likely make it 12V, put in a 1600=
 and a 
freeway flyer tranny. This bus is going to be built to travel.=
 Since 
it's not going to be bone-stock anyway...not having the OG=
 running 
gear is not a priority. Most people who know me know that I'm a=
 close 
relative of the Vintage Storm Troopers...but this project is 
different.

The other plan we have for it is that we've had a single wheel 
trailer donated by fellow listee, SV2s member and a heck of a guy=
 
Aaron Hill that will be turned into a BBQ trailer. So, we'll be=
 able 
to pull into Havasu and get things ROCKING! :)

Thanks for all of the emails...I'll pick up a couple of copies as=
 
soon as they hit the shelves. I'm sure I'll be asking the list=
 for 
various parts and such (Thom...I might want to talk to you about=
 that 
58 decklid you have/had).

I'll keep you all updated!

Scott
