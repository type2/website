Michael,

I'm not an expert, but I have changed my starter bushing a couple of times
so here goes with my advice. See the elongated shaft on the 6V starter? This
slides into a corresponding hole in the transmission housing. Check with a
flashlight while the engine is out to see if there is a bushing there now,
you may be able to feel it with your pinkie finger. You need a brass bushing
in that hole to support the starter shaft otherwise the starter will not
turn freely. If this were my bus I would order up a new 6V bushing, the 12V
bushings and the "6-to-12 Volt" bushing are of different internal diameter.
I would change the bushing out now while everything's apart. Once the engine
is reinstalled you cannot change the bushing because the hole is inside the
seam of the engine-transmission assembly. Bushings are not hard to change
with the engine out I just lined up the new bushing in the hole and tapped
it in with a plastic mallet, tapping the new one in drove the old one out, I
continued to tap it in until it felt and looked like it was in the proper
distance then I bolted up the starter. I believe that Eric and Barb will
second me in that a little graphite lubricant inside the bushing is a good
idea before you slide the starter shaft in for the final time.
Hope this helps.
