Subject: no brakes

In my 65, the pedal went all the way to the floor when I bought it.  Bone
dry on brake fluid, so I put some in, to try and pump it through to find the
leak.  The fluid level has remained the same for two weeks and pumping
accomplishes nothing.  Underneath, from the outside, all components are
attached, and appear to be ding their job.  I plan on re-doing the whole
system from MC on back, but would really like to have just some braking
ability to roll it in and out of the garage for now.  Any thoughts
appreciated
