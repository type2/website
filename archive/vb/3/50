A quick Google for 'ross steering' shows several applications of Ross
steering boxes on heavy trucks, buses, big RVs, and (oddly) older garden
tractors.

I personally have never heard of a Ross-made steering box on a split or
a bay but that doesn't mean they don't exist.  ATE (Teves) and ZF
(Zunradfabrik Fredrichshaven) are the ones I have heard of, but again,
I haven't heard that much.

You might ask around at places that supply big truck/bus/big RV parts -
give them the Ross part number and see if they have any leads for you.
