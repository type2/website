After you do that, check for vacuum leaks.  Jim is right, exhaust leaks
are the more common problem here, but because you also mention a high
idle, I suspect that a vacuum leak may be involved.  The "air management
system" must be leak-free from air filter to muffler for everything to
work correctly.
