Subject: Zwitter

 Had a Zwitter in the 60's and made a baja out of it. Russ W. had one also.
Way cool. Used to drive them to the DKB meets and Bug Ins. Even then it
pissed off the you know whos. Last Zwitter I had  was sold around early 90's
to a guy in Siera Vista Az, wonder if it ever got restored? Ah, the old days
of VWing. Will write a book someday.
