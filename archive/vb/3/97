>My Bus has no seats and everytime I go to a show and look at what people=

are
using for seats I can't figure out if they have the right ones.  I would
really like to know what types of seats to hunt for.
55 Kombi/Standard?

A '55 Kombi would have a black seat similar to this:

except with 6-legs (same as  a Barndoor, i.e. $$$$)

A '55 Standard would have the same seat except green upholstery, same bla=
ck
grab handles.  Also 6 legs.  I have a 4-leg '56-'57 Green Standard seat
in almost perfect condition for sale but it's real expensive.

Did it have a headliner in it?  Or maybe it just has the little headliner=

hooks still welded to the roof?  If yes, it's a Standard.
