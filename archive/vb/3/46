This can be cut down to just the article ID and still work:

http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=g13e4.14569%24s5.166902%40news1.frmt1.sfba.home.com

The article is by Larry Robinson (Fat Freddy), about a book on Solex 
carburetors, "How to Adjust, Tune, Repair, and Rebuild Solex 2 & 4 Barrel 
Downdraft Carburetors for Maximum Performance Shop Manual":

LR> Published in 1987.  ISBN number 0-87938-253-8 (soft).
LR> It was first published by Carbooks, Inc. in 1973.  

>this would be a great addition to the
>Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project

Per Amazon it *is* out of print, but I personally would be leery of
scanning something that was in print as late as 1987.  Don't know how
Andrew would feel about it.  Also I'm not sure if 2 or 4 barrel Solexes
were ever used on air-cooled VWs as stock or aftermarket parts.  And
if we did want to scan it, somebody would have to lend us a copy of
the book... :)

The doc project does have a copy of "Solex: Selection and Tuning of the
Carburetor" online at http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/solex.html .

Note that the doc project is now and hopefully permanently located at
http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/docproject.html .  The version
of the site that Thom is hosting for us at
http://www.vintagebus.com/docs/docproject.html is still up, but we
aren't updating it any more.  Also, it doesn't have PDFs or .tar.gz
files for the various manuals - we were trying to be as polite as
possible to Thom's generous donation of space and bandwidth.  :)  
These larger files are hosted at the new location, which will also
be updated whenever we have a new book.

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
