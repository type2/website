Subject: m-codes, paint/upholstry, export codes

Can anybody help us decipher the rest of our ID plate? We have not been able
to find what m-code 388 is for. Also the country code XE, and for
paint/upholstry it lists the numbers 523506. The bus is Dove Blue so we
don't understand the #'s it gives for paint/upholstry. Many thanks for your
help.
