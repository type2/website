Hi Bart,
Unless you are used to working with and on dual carbs we suggest you leave 
them till you get back and have a lot more time to get familar with them!  Do 
install the 68-71 bus gas tank there are still a few stretches of highway out 
there that have nearly 200 miles between any gas staions.  We had to dent the 
center rear edge of the late tank to fit the body hump over the tranny bell 
housing in our 1960 panel camper conversion.
