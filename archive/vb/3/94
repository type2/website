Subject: Gorgeous Show... 

My hat off to Craig Spaeth and crew for pulling off a nice small show
yesterday in Hood River OR.... for those that are in the pnl and didn't make
it, shame shame.... (ok, I miss most of the pnl shows so i guess i'm not one
to criticize ;-))
The 58 ghia vert ran pretty flawlessly since the 59 doublecab is still
awaiting a few more parts.

... and the best part, I found my two 4x12mm front gate bumper screws...
WOHOOO
