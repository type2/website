Subject: Taillight Solved

A busload of thank you's to everyone who offered up advice about my recent
taillight problem. The majority of folks suggested bad grounding (or
earthing, if you will).
So at the outset of my repair session I replaced the ground wire and
connectors, double-checked that I had the proper wires connected to the
appropriate connectors and lastly, as I believe my friend Billy Knudsen
suggested, I checked to see that the correct (i.e. 6-volt) bulb was firmly
and properly installed in its socket.
As a result of your suggestions I now have a bright taillight complete with
turn signal and brakelight on my passenger side. This eases my paranoia
about being rear-ended considerably and makes any trip in the bus more
relaxed.
This is even more important to me now that my 16 year old son is driving the
bus on a regular basis, it was nice to watch him leave the driveway just now
and see the signal and brake lights working as they should when he stopped
at the corner stop sign.
thanks again everyone.
