Hey
Yes you might break it, and no you cant just leave it. If you leave that big
of a starter bushing in there, the starter will be binding and prolly not
even turn over the engine cause it will slip. Thats the point of the bushing
(besides guiding it), is to support the starter. Plus it will start
oblonging the bushing until the point that it digs into your tranny housing
which then yer super screwed and replacing the bushing wont even help. You
dont have much choice if you wanna run 6v now, just be easy tapping it out.

Wonder if somehow you could switch the front body section of a 12v self
supporter and a 6v, then cut the end of the 6v starter shaft off and never
have to worry about bushings again.....
