Subject: Trying to keep cool.

Over the past couple weeks, we've endured 90 to 100F temps with 60% humidity
more or less.  The air is so heavy you can hardly breathe.  Well I've had
this idea of sewing acquarium tubing into some clothes and hooking it up to
the garden hose to keep cool.  Sounds zany but it just might work.

So I went to walmart - bought the hose and fittings I needed.  I sewed the
tubing into my cap and then wrapped my torso in the line.  I hooked up and
within about 15 seconds I was outside and not sweating!  Damn.  So started
working on the swingaxle boots on my bus.  All was well until my poor splice
gave way and soaked my overalls.  I figured I'd finish my work so there I
lay under the bus, water bubbling forth from my overalls looking like I'm
taking a major piss.  As funny as it all sounds - I couldn't believe how
awesome this was - working in the heat and not sweating.  The tether was
only mildy annoying compared to the heat.

I think this is an idea I'm gonna work on some more in the future...
