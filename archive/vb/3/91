Shawn-

I have been confused by the seat issue as well.  My 67 21 window 
walkthru has a full width seat, with key ways all the way across. 
That leads me to suspect that it originally had a full length seat 
(making the bus an 8 passenger).  Having said that, I think the seat 
I have is not correct for the bus since the legs and the keyways do 
not line up!  I have been told that 67 middle seats were unique... 
This probably isn't any help to you, but perhaps it will get a 
response from one of the experts that will help us both!
