Subject: Re: steering Box!


    I am back with another question for the list hopefully it is an easy
one. I just received a steering box out of a 65 bus that is from a company
called Ross (pn: 6222010139). Is this a common steering box or one of those
rare after market companies that made steering boxes.  I would like to
install it in my 67 bus but I am not sure if there is any difference between
65 and 67. It appears to be in good shape and I was just curious if this was
a common steering box. One other thing is there anyone selling the steering
box gears to rebuild these.

Any Thoughts
