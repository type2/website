Subject: EMPI steering wheel update

As my friend Dan Kinsey has in his bus, I too have an EMPI GT Steering wheel
for my bus.  They were never made for buses but it just so happens that the
EMPI GT wheel for the Toyotas and Datsuns work with some slight
modifications.

#1 I had Rob machine out the center hub of the wheel and cut a keyway for
me.  This removed the splines that the steering wheel came with.

When installing this wheel, the first thing you notice is the smaller
dimension thus necessitating the use of more force to get the wheels to
turn.  The other drawbacks are no horn and no turn signal auto cancel.
Since I've driven with my turn signal on a couple of times, I decided that I
must fix this before leaving for Colorado this weekend so as to avoid an
accident.  As it stands, I've had several people pull out in front of me
because they thought I was turning!

#2  Pulled off the turn signal auto cancel ring from my stock wheel.  Using
the dremel I cleared 3 little notches in the ring and it fit the EMPI wheel.
Next was just a matter of drilling and tapping 3 holes with which to mount
the canceling ring with.  I did this no problem and now have fully
functional turn signal canceling!

#3  Modified the horn button workings so the horn would work properly.  It
was kind of a kludge and necessitated clipping some pegs from the horn
button actuator but the horn does indeed now work.

That was quite a bunch of mods for a the wheel but now Dan and I will be
EMPI GT twins - him in his 1958 Binz and me in my 1967 thrashed deluxe. :-)
