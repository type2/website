Subject: Re: [VB] 6v / 12v Starter Question..

Hey fire panel michael,
Since you have the special self supporting 12v starter, with no shaft, Could
be possible you dont even have a bushing in the tranny (which is why you
cant see it) since a self supporter starter doesn't require one, or maybe
the PO wrecked the last bushing to the point where it started to oval out
the tranny hole, so they ripped it out and went to the self supporting style
which i have seen happen before. Anyway heres a pic of the bushing being
inspected for I.D. wear, with a special tool:

 Be sure to grease the I.D. of the new bushing with VW A051 grease! =)
(A.k.a whatever grease you can get your hands on) Also Since there are 3
different bushing sizes, make sure you get the right one.
