Subject: Re: [VB] Middle seat fit

I believe that is what came (not originally) with my
66 Deluxe that I am restoring because the middle seat
has plastic plugs where a set of headrests should go. 
I should be able to cover these to match the other
seats but I need an armrest as there is only a
protuding metal and it doesnt look very safe.  If I
left it as a hippy bus I could give it the Red Green
solution and wrap it with a bunch of duct tape.
