Subject: Bob Hoover missing!


Got your attention ...huh?

Don't worry I'm sure he's fine.  What is missing though is my copy of
his invaluable sermon CD-ROM.  I bought my copy from the Bus Depot a few

years ago, but now I can't seem to find it any where around this well
organized office.....I mean awful mess.

I guess the CD is NLA at the Bus Depot (Ron are you reading...is this
true??) as I e-mailed the question to them and got no response.  Does
anyone know where I can buy a new copy?  Or, can some one can burn me a
copy and I get his address and send him the money directly.

I'm going to rebuild my motor again and I want to read some of his
pearls again.

Thanks!

Steve
