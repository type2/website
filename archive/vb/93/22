Subject: Mirrors & seat belts now installed, with Q's ??

I have put the seat belts in and installed the mirrors that I bought in 
Germany last year at the Hessisch Oldendorf swap area.
I have asked Clara to find out the vintage of the 
211 857 513C mirrors and she does not have a book that covers that year.
I think the mirrors look correct on a commercial vehicle but are they correct 
for 63?
