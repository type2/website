I think that by not going to a show you show that, not
only you are you die hard, but you have a voice that
counts and will be heard. If they sell even one car we
still lose, right? If the show was moved or resheduled
wouldn't the charities still benefit? The real winners
should be the people who came to the show to enjoy
their hobby, especially those who want to keep it
going. 
I guess we will just have to agree to disagree.
