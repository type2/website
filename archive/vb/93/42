On that same note, I have a set of my Repro tent poles waiting for me. I
saw them today when I dropped off the 3 piece "flap pole" (Thanks
Ronnie!) to be done as well. These poles sets will have everything except
the roof mounts, I even had the bumper mount done. Problem is price is
going to be $500-$600 will anyone pay this? We'll see. If no one does at
least I'll have another set of poles when I find a complete tent minus
poles.
