Bill,

Ed seems to be saying that the MVVC can't walk away from this venue 
because, and only because, doing so would hit them in the pocketbook so 
severely that they couldn't continue to host the show.

It should be possible to quantify exactly how much money they'd lose if 
they cancelled their contracts, etc. (at least assuming that cancelling 
them wouldn't lead to lawsuits, only to penalties) and held the show at 
another venue.

If it were possible to raise this much money on line, and give it to the 
MVVC to offset those costs, do you think the MVVC would then repudiate 
VWOA publicly?
