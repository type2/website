Hello Guys & Gals   I have been using a Dunn-Rite VW air compressor for a 
while works great 58 cfm 120 psi. I was given the engine kit from a friend 
that won it at Cicrle yer wagens show , best in show prize, He didn't really 
need it and owed me for helping him get all the little parts for his show 
car(63 ragtop VW trends cover  etc. ) Draw backs are the air will be hot and 
does have a smell, but the best way to sandblast and run sanders. Just used 
it to strip my latest project 67 panel. Also recommend getting the check 
valves and tank from them. I have mine mounted on the back of a little 
trailer that I got from Northern Has room to carry sandblaster and sand, put 
a tool box on the front , readdy to blast anywhere.  Later and Have fun  Mark
