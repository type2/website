Subject: Looking for gas tank parts

Hi Everyone-

I am restoring the gas tank on my 1965 bus. I need to replace the sealing =
washer that goes on the underside of the tank and keeps the threaded =
"spigot" from leaking gas all over the engine. I looked in my part manual =
and came up with 111 209 139 and 111 209 147A- any idea where I can find =
these parts? Based on the 111 number it appears that the parts are shared =
with Beetles.

Thanks!

Michael

On that same note, I have a set of my Repro tent poles waiting for me. I
saw them today when I dropped off the 3 piece "flap pole" (Thanks
Ronnie!) to be done as well. These poles sets will have everything except
the roof mounts, I even had the bumper mount done. Problem is price is
going to be $500-$600 will anyone pay this? We'll see. If no one does at
least I'll have another set of poles when I find a complete tent minus
poles.
