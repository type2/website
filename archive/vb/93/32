Hi Steve,
Nope!  Only when abused with really snappy shoving gear shifting or badly 
adjusted clutch and since they only work to get the two gear to the same RPM 
in a few moments.  
  Here below is some of the info from aforementioned Anchor Bronze &Metals, 
Inc. website:

Bronze to steel results in sacrificial wear of the bronze and little or no 
wear of the steel.
Bronze to steel results in much lower friction forces than with steel to 
steel.
At high relative surface speeds, full film or hydrodynamic lubrication will 
separate the steel to steel pair, but at lower speeds, the asperities 
(surface roughness) of the mating parts contact each other. This results in 
severe wear of both steel parts. With the bronze to steel pair, the stronger 
steel asperities shear of the weaker bronze asperities.

Strength to withstand the required loads.
Low coefficient of friction against steel.
Minimum wear of the bronze.
