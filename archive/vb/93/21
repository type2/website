Hullo, list.

The rusty old non-stock exhaust on my camper's dp engine seems to be
giving up the ghost.  It makes noise (not deafening but DEFINITELY
there) during acceleration though is as "quiet" as usual while idling or
cruising.  Obviously it needs replacing, but will driving it as-is
damage my engine?  I am not a hotrodder and am happy trundling about
town with my H30/31 PICT getting 20 mpg.  I've heard things about
"floating valves" if there is insufficient back-pressure.

I may be getting down-sized next week so I am hoping to avoid/delay some
expenses, if prudent.  Usually I jump on these kinds of things.  I do
have another vehicle option if necessary but it's not the same...

TIA, all.
