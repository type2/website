Subject: RE: [VB] not a public debate room!!!!!

so...do something. Start a campaign in response. A petition to start 
with. Get on all the lists and the newsgroups and bullitin boards and 
have people go somewhere and enter their info. Have a form letter 
they can print out and send in. Use the word boycott and media. 
Create an organiztion and make letterhead. Threaten to write to shows 
who use VW advertising. Works for those lame groups that go after 
things like Howard Stern and South Park.

Complaining amongst each other only goes so far. If you wanna 
actually get through to them you gotta get organized and be 
pro-active. Threaten them where it counts...the wallet!!! Right now 
they count on people just going along with what happens whether they 
like it or not.
