I disagree. We need to spread the word about what is
REALLY going on. If the show was cancelled it would
send a VERY strong message to VW about what they are
up to. I have dealt with a promoter one on one and was
left nowhere! I am one voice that counts but a group
will get more attention.
I would be interested to know how many present VW
owners had owned VW before they purchased their new
VW. People are loyal to makes but it seems to me that
VW owners are very loyal, or they used to be. 
 I have owned a lot of VW's myself, even a water
cooled, but I won't buy a new one. I'll stick with my
Westy and pass on any event that has VWOA sponsorship.
