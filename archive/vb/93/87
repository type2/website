er, correction-  though I did not find that part number in my books, I do 
have books that cover 1963.   The bay outside mirror is the 211 857 513 H 
version, so I said the mirrors would be earlier than that.   There are a few 
mirrors unlisted by the time you get to H.  Evidently they came in the old 
style VW box with the \x/ logos hatched all over the blue, not sure when they 
quit those boxes, but that gives an idea of the date of production.   I found 
references to 'plane' and 'konvex' mirrors in the parts lists, think they 
mean 'flat' when they wrote 'plane'- one of those translation things.     

Did not find the elephant ear or the mirrors that go on the D arms listed 
either.  Just the round one.  Thought an accessory list might have these 
various mirrors.  anyone?

 Hi Sam,
 Those mirrors do not show up in any manual we have.  Best guess is they are 
 much later made accessory mirrors.  As for the correct basic exterior mirror 
 would be a single round one on the driver side.
