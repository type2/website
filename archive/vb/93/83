Subject: anti VWoA propaganda piece for Auburn Hills

anyone want to help with this thing. ive gone to the link 
http://billberckman.tripod.com/domain.htm but a LOT of the links are gone. 
does anyone have any other links, lists of businesses/websites that have 
been shut down. i have a copy of the letter that VWoA was sending out...
