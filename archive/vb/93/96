I don't have any good vintage info but it's interesting to look at.
It looks like the tranny is mostly hollow (no gears) and is just
there for the bell housing and input shaft.  Also it looks like
the brake (for loading the engine) is that big round thing under
the instrument panel.  There's a little tank on the left side (as
you stand at the controls) with a red and yellow sticker on it;
what's that for? 

I find it mildly amusing that the tachometer goes to 10,000 RPM,
and that the big gauge goes up to 300 HP ((-at-) 10,000 RPM).  Maybe
I'm too used to the 1500 in my Bus to understand a 2200 that
might actually peg these gauges without exploding.  :)

It's interesting how the meaning of "finding a stash of good stuff"
has evolved over the lifetime of our Buses...
