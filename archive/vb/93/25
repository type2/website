I think you are not getting enough juice to squeeze through that 20'
run of aged wiring to overcome the aged gumminess of the starter
armature. Either cleaning the starter (uh, inside too) and relubing or
fixing the wiring should help, the long-term fix would probably be
doing both. Whupping the starter with a wrench is a traditional
treatment for all sorts of starter woes, sometimes it even works a
couple of times...

Ok my starter starts when it wants to and my hand and screwdriver do
the
starting when it doesnt.  Why is it that when I turn the key the
starter
clicks, but when I crawl under the bus and cross the two wires it
comes right
to life???  The little things that keep me and my 59 closer than I
want to be
sometimes....
