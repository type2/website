The cheap small tubing bender (basically a round mandrel with a stop
to hold the tubing) works well for tight bends, like the turn into
the wheel cylinder, inboard of the backing plate.  For larger-radius
bends, your hands work just fine.  Go slow and easy - spread out your
hands and don't worry about getting it into the exact shape in one
shot.  Bend a little, stop, check the progress, bend some more.

I replaced all the hard lines on my '64 this way and it went just fine.
First I took off one of the crusty lines and practiced bending on it
to see how much was too much, and then I got started on the replacement
lines.

Now is also a good time to replace those little split rubber bushings
that protect the brake lines where they go through the frame rails.
You may also find some brake line clips held to the frame with 10mm
bolts; keep track of these - I managed to lose one of mine.

Good luck!
