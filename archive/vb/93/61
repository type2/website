For anyone else who may not know, In a nutshell, Volkswagen of America is coming down very hard on many small businesses and web sites that promote products for VW's.  Any company that has the word "bug" or "bus" in their name is in danger of a lawsuit from VWoA.  There are many instances of this, but for example, a parts supplier named "BugBarn" got a letter from VWoA's lawyers saying that they must stop using their name or face legal action.  Many of these companies are very small operations that could never in a million years be a threat to VW.  All of us air-cooled hobbyists are afraid that sooner than later, all of our parts suppliers will be forced out of business leaving us out of luck.  VWoA has already stopped ALL use of the VW logo for mudflaps, accessories, etc. The real pisser is that they are forcing these small companies out of business, yet most VW dealers REFUSE to deal in air cooled parts or service.  Then they have the nerve to use our air-cooled community fo!
r promotion of their new cars (have you seen the new commercials featuring the Old Beetle and the split window bus?)  This is only the abridged version of what is happening, but it hopefully illustrates some of what is happening.  I for one, do wish to be pimped so VW can sell their new "microbus" for $35 Grand!!
