Subject: Re: [VB] starter woes...

I recently re-read the instructions that came with my new starter that 
said the solenoid now needed a minimum of 9 volts to engage.  I was 
losing at least a few volts from a bad ground connection.  Renewing that 
connection- sanding down to the paint on the ground connection from the 
battery to the body- got me back my starting.
