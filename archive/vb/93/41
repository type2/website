Raymond Heath passed the info to me a month ago. VolksAir is found
at  www.angelfire.com/Biz/DunnRight
The current generation uses a dual-port type 1 engine configuration,
running fuel on 2 cylinders and pumping 58scfm (-at-) 100 psi into a
10 gallon tank on the other two. the trick is the cam.
Since the primary use for so much air is sandblasting, i'm  thinking
that instead of a trailer, why not mount the "compressor" on a "sand rail "
and have a mobile sandblasting service ???
