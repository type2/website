I'll go ahead and report.?

Once again, Leah is afk so I'll step in. The short version...?
?
Leah got all the info from Ted. Well, ownership of Ted's paypal account couldn't be transferred and with a move in email addresses having to be done, Leah went for the route of 'donations(-at-)type2.com.' The account is born and funds are transfered over from the old tedebare account to the new 'donations' account. Well, PayPal's automated flags were raised and they basically shut the account down. Leah replied to them immediately and then also called them. When she told the guy on the phone that the account had been given out for those who felt the services provided were worth a donation, he went off and shut the account down even further, stating that Non-Profit organization documents were needed and voided checks from the bank, etc, etc. A later call today to PayPal revealed that the previous customer support guy went way overboard, but that regualar reps could do nothing at this point and it had to be escalated.?
?
This essentially has shutdown the new donations(-at-)type2.com account. I've edited the donate page to reflect this, and have pointed current donations at leah personal account. Leah's direct email is on the page for questions exactly like this. But I'll go ahead and point it out here too though, since I am writing this message, and maybe the email link on the page is not very visible....?
?
leah(-at-)type2.com?
?
Her and I both stare at our iPhones more than we should, so do email her if you have questions. Leah has been working on this as much as she can to make things smooth and quiet, and the circumstances have not made that easy.?
