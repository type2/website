Subject: Tranny gearing?

I need some help figuring out what transmission gearing I have.  My
second gear synchro went out last year, and although I've gotten pretty
good with shifting into 2nd by matching rpm and double clutching, I'm
really starting to miss simple easy shifts.  I'd like to put in a
rebuilt tranny with the same gearing I currently have, if I can figure
out what it is.

The bus is a 67 westy.  As far as I know, it's still got the original
tranny (I'm the 4th owner).  It's got a 12V starter motor.  The tires
I'm running are 185R14.  The engine is a single port with a 30PICT1 and
a vacuum advance dizzy.  The PO told me that it was a 1600 engine.

So, this past weekend, I went out for a drive with a new tach and a GPS.
The GPS showed that my speedo was pretty accurate (within 1 mph).  Don't
know if the tach is accurate - I'll just have to trust it.

So I made notes of the speeds at 2000 rpm, 3000 rpm, and 3500 rpm in
2nd, 3rd, and 4th gear.  Here's what I found:

Gear - Tach  - Speed

  2    2000	     13
  2    2500	     16
  2    3000      18
  2    3500      22

  3    2000	     19
  3    2500	     26
  3    3000      31
  3    3500      37

  4    2000	     32
  4    2500	     40
  4    3000      48
  4    3500      56

Based on the info I found in the VB archives, I'd expect my 67 to have
1.26 rgb gearing,  0.82 4th gear, and 4.37 r&P which should give me
around 61 mph at 3500 rpm in 4th gear.  Is that right?  It seems like my
top speed is a little lower that I would have expected.

It would be nice to have a bit more speed at the top end, but it's
pretty hilly where I live.  I climb about 500 ft elevation in about 3
miles to get to work, and I can just do it in 3rd gear.  I don't think
that I want to sacrifice climbing ability to go a few mph faster on the
level roads.

So, any suggestions about what tranny gearing I have?

Thanks,
