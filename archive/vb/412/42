Subject: Re:  New location for (exploded) parts manuals?

  The parts manuals are no longer loading from http://failsure.net/ oacdp/
(link from VintageBus.com). Anyone know the location of these? I'm trying to
figure out where to see the details/locations of rubber boots on the
transmission nose cone (65), or if there is a rubber boot between the coupler
and the transmission? WWest doesn't like to advertise they have trans-related
bus parts I guess, as it isn't in their (otherwise excellent) catalog.
