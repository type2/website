Looking at the parts manual, it seems to depend on the year; barndoors
(to March 1955) had different LHD and RHD drag links; later models seem
to have the same one.  The top level is at
http://oacdp.freeweb7.com/5867part.html and the relevant pages are:

http://oacdp.freeweb7.com/5867part/271.png  (list)

Call-out 54 (p. 267) is the drag link; on p. 271 it shows just one part
number - 211 415 701 D - for chassis 20-117 902 and up (post-barndoor).
Barndoors have two different part numbers for the drag link: 211 415 701
(LHD) and 214 415 701 (RHD).
