Andy asked:
What is a Kamper Kit?  Can you buy it now for a conversion?

Thanks for the wing window tips.
Kamper Kits is long out of business as far as I know. They did conversions 
on almost any van be it VW or American in the 60's, 70's and into the 80's. 
The VW conversion is similar to a Westy or a Sun Dial. The significant 
difference is the closet and fold down bed. The closet is narrower and the 
bed is wider than any other camper conversion allowing for a 4x8 sheet of 
material to be placed onto the folded down bed thru the rear hatch.
And I have carried lots of plywood in my Kamper. I've only seen one other 
Kamper Kit conversion in a bus so I suspect that their bus business was not 
very big.
