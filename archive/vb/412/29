Sam,

I think it runs fairly well after the engine warms up. I have a dp 1776 with a
"stock pea shooter muffler" and a 3.88 R&P. I lose some power at freeway
speeds from the restriction. The carb used to give me fits until I found that
the 2nd barrel was open just a crack. Couldn't get it adjusted right and had
flat spots. I adjusted the stop screw to allow the butterfly valve to close
and from there things worked just fine.
The last long drive I took on an open freeway gave me 23mpg. Not bad.

  How does it run with the Weber progressive carb?
