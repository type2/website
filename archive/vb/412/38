Subject: Re: [VB] Tranny gearing?

Some people live on the flat.? Some people don't
If you drive over hills from?time to time, taller gearing? (3.88, 3.43) will not be as?fun as on the flat roads.? 
A 4.12 r/p would would still be good.? 
Westys are fairly heavy with the camping kit in them.??I would not recommend a 3.88 r/p in one with a 1600 engine, even if you live on the flat.

If you go with a 1776, a 3.88 R&P is the way to go. Ronnie might tell you to use a 3.43 with larger engines.?
