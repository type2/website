Subject: vintage snow bus ad

Does anyone remember seeing that VW bus advertisement, where they show a bus
going up hill in the snow, and the tag line is something like-how do you
think the snow plow driver gets to work?

I could be confusing ad's.but I know there was a bus ad with the bus in the
snow. I thought I had saved it from the net, but now can't find it.

Anyone know where to find it?

Thanks,

-Kevin
