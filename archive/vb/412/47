Well,

This was originally known as the Obsolete Aircooled Documentation  
Project (Type 2 Parts Reference) hosted on the "atlasta.net" site.  
Looks like the 'new' site is no longer in service.

I did find a site that looks like they downloaded the PDF versions: http://www.kleinbus.cl/info_58_67.htm
