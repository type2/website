I can get these (they'd arrive around the first of the year).  The price
would be the cover price of $39.95 plus shipping from PA. (This is a lot
cheaper than shipping from the UK.)  I'm not sure how many people would want
it at that price. If you'd like one, please email me off-list.  The response
will determine whether I import it.
