You might take a look at http://oacdp.freeweb7.com/wog69/109.png , which
is a little hard to read, but does have the gear-ratio info.  (The top
level is at http://oacdp.freeweb7.com/wog69.html ).  From that, what I
*think* your Bus would have had, stock, was:

1st  3.80:1
2nd  2.06:1
3rd  1.26:1   (was 1.22:1 through 1966)
4th  0.82:1

R&P  4.375:1  (for Buses through 1967; it got higher after they dropped
                the reduction boxes for '68-up)

RGB  1.26:1

This gives theoretical total ratios of

2nd  2.06 * 4.375 * 1.26 = 11.36 :1
3rd  1.26 * 4.375 * 1.26 =  6.946:1
4th  0.82 * 4.375 * 1.26 =  4.520:1

Ratwell ( http://www.ratwell.com/technical/Tires.html ) says a 185R14
tire has a circumference of 81.51", yielding 801.85 revs per mile.  But
if I take (5280 * 12 / 81.51) I get 777.33 revs per mile.
http://www.1010tires.com/TireSizeCalculator.asp claims 80.58" and 810.9
revs per mile; I get 786.30 revs per mile.
http://www.sl113.org/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=WheelsTires.TireSize gives a
rolling radius of 1983 mm +/- 5%; this is equal to 78.07" +/- 3.904" and
I get 772.92 to 854.28 revs per mile.  Probably some of the difference
is static vs. dynamic measurement; it also depends on things like how
wide of a rim the tire is mounted on, how much air is in the tire, and
how fast you are going.  Anyway, the range is something like 777-854
revs/mile for this size tire.

I stuck your numbers in a spreadsheet and your 4th gear numbers are the
most consistent with each other.  This is probably expected, as you are
going faster, and a 1 mph error on the speedo doesn't cause as much of a
variation in the results.  For 3rd gear, your measurement at 2000 rpm is
the outlier, at about 10% above the other three readings.  For 2nd gear,
your measurement at 3000 rpm is the outlier, at about 5-8% above the
other three readings.

If you look at the average of all four readings in each gear, a tire
"size" of 829.6 revs/mile gives a fairly good match to the above ratios
(11.5:1, 7.10:1, and 4.52:1 respectively).  If you throw out the two
outliers in 2nd and 3rd gear, the match is even better (11.3:1, 6.93:1,
4.52:1).  829.6 revs/mile for your tires might be a little on the high
side but doesn't seem to be out of the realm of possibility.

Just for grins, if you did have the 4.125:1 R&P, the theoretical total
ratios would be

2nd  2.06 * 4.125 * 1.26 = 10.71:1
3rd  1.26 * 4.125 * 1.26 =  6.549:1
4th  0.82 * 4.125 * 1.26 =  4.262:1

and to make these fit your data, you need a tire "size" of 880.3
revs/mile.  This gives 10.8:1, 6.69:1, and 4.26:1 for all your data
or 10.7:1, 6.53:1, 4.26:1 less the outliers.  This tire "size" is so far
above anything I can find for the actual size of a 185R14 that I think
you have a fair-to-middlin' chance of really having the 4.375:1 R&P.

As always, these vehicles are 40 years old and many interesting and
creative parts swaps may have taken place.  Your mileage may vary.  :)
