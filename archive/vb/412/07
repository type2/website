Subject: Re: [VB] Steering wheel position

Hi Chris,
Have not heard about the longer later drag link.  
 
WOULD BE VERY CAREFULL of changing angle of pitman arm.  If drag  link and 
pitman arm get even close to parallel to each other the steering can  lock 
up!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
  First suggest you check if you have one or two adjustable tie  rods.
 
  Stock should only be one, but some volks have installed two.   If two it is 
better to adjust the tie rods till you have enough room to install  the 
longer drag link.
 
  If you only have one adjustable would cut and weld the drag link  shorter.
 
E&B
