Hey Campers,

What are you all doing over the holidays with all that time off from work? I 
for one will be installing new wing window seals and maybe installing a new 
stainless steel fuel line. The current one is prone to vapor lock due to a 
small internal diameter. Gotta get ready for those hot summer days coming 
soon. Global warming you know.
