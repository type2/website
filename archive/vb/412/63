Dave,

I still have my original intake from my 64 28psit carb. Haven't actually 
seen the manifold in a few years, as I am using an aftermarket carb. If you 
really need a to know, I can dig it out later this week and take a look. I 
know exactly where it is so its not much of a problem.

Let me know.
