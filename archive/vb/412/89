Hi,

The last time I used the Type2.com classifieds was in '96 - or  
something like that. It was for a middle seat. :-) I gave up after the  
first response was $450 + shipping. :-)

That was back when we had one list. Ah the good 'ol days.

I think our biggest need is to figure out how to leverage the  
archives, improved searching would be awesome.
