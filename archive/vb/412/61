I bet it would be light grey.

OK, so here's a question for the gang:  what is the factory original color
supposed to be for a 1500 single port intake manifold?  I have refurbished a
used manifold for my 67 doublecab engine rebuild, and I am trying to repaint
it to look like original.  I have seen other used ones in various single
colors, and I have also seen them in one color for the pipes, and another
color for the heat jacket.  I also have a picture of the engine bay from a
1965 bus brochure where it appears that the manifold was painted all LIGHT
GREY, which is the same color that the crappy reproduction manifolds (made
in god-knows-where) come with.

Does anyone have any original manifolds on hand that can confirm the factory
color?  Is it supposed to be light grey?  Thanks a buttload and Merry Xmas!
