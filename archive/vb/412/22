Subject: Backwards voltage conversion 12v to 6 v

Howdy Y'all,
Read a lot in the archives about taking a 6 volt vehicle and converting to run on a 12 volt engine and electrical setup.  BUT, I have a perfectly good complete turnkey 6volt 1500 SP engine that I want to put into a bug that is a 12 volt vehicle.  So, what is the QUICKEST, EASIEST, CHEAPEST way to accomplish what I need to (which is make my 6 volt turnkey engine run in my 12volt vehicle?)

PEACE! 
John Baker
