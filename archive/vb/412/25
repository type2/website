The  easiest thing would probably be to convert the engine to 12 volt.  

Hi Dan,
Do not forget the changing of the FW, thusly probably the clutch  parts, plus 
resetting  crank end play, and replacing FW  seal.
 
  What would really be good to know is the year/type of the 12 volt  VW.  EG 
the later Beetles have the regulator under the rear seat, so to  convert to 6 
volt you would have to come up with a whole way to convert either  the 6 volt 
reg to fit the wiring or the wiring to the regulator on the  engine.
 
  Plus with any stock 12 volt VW you would have the problem of  getting a 12 
volt wiper to work on a six volt system.
 
So if the VW in question was originally a 6 volt one these problems would  
not arise.
