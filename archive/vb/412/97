I have seen a *Bug* ad on this theme.  (Not when it first aired on TV;
I'm not old enough.)  This appears to be it:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMNdErHU208

The above ad has US-style license plates, an English voice-over, and
is in B&W.  I found another one with Euro-style license plates, a German
voice-over, and in color, that appears to have some shots in common
with the one above:

(For saving local copies of YouTube videos, I like to use Firefox with the
UnPlug add-on: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2254 .
Unfortunately it doesn't seem to have been updated for Firefox 3.)

The German on this second ad is a little fast for me, but an approximate
translation is: "This man is on his way to work.  His job is a snow plow
driver.  When you have to go to work, drive a Volkswagen."

I have seen some pictures (in books) of 4WD Vanagons being tested
in Germany.  One that I've seen in a couple of books shows a Vanagon
going uphill at about a 45 degree angle.  The Vanagon Syncros were
sold here but I've read that you could get even more options on them
in Europe, like locking differentials, that weren't offered here. 

There are also photos of some home-brews, including a pre-Vanagon
(I don't remember if it's a splitty) in the snow with tank treads instead
of rear tires.
