Subject: Progessive Carb Linkage

Hi,

I have a Weber Progressive carb which has its linkage in a position that 
stands a little higher than my old 28PICT. The standard throttle cable angle 
was a little too steep and didn't work well. Solution: drill a new hole in 
the fan shroud and make a custom cable toture tube to guide it past the new 
dog house cooler. This  required a heavier spring to return the carb to a 
closed position due to the extra friction in the tube.

Decided it was time to return my bus throttle cable back to the stock 
position.
The new deal is a custom linkage! Saw photos of something similar in the old 
Hot VW's All About Performance Engines. Look just above the dizzy cables. 
There is a right angle aluminum block connected via spherical bearings to 
the carb link. Have a look at the photos thru the links below. The new 
system is working well.
