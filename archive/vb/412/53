Those are an SOB.  They do not just fit right in and that is that,  There is a
little recess inside the seal where you need to but a little slot for the top
vent window hinge to fit through.  You cant install them without doing this.
Luckily I had a spare window assembly in my junk pile to look at.  There is a
recess for the cut if you look.  Then it is just a matter of working the seal
down into the frame and it is a tight squeeze to say the least.  You need to
really push for it to finally pop into place.  Then install the window and
slowly try to get it to close.  I broke a WCM latch trying to use the latch to
close the window in the seal.  Don't do it.

What is a Kamper Kit?  Can you buy it now for a conversion?
