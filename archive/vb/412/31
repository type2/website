How about drilling and tapping a 10-32 blind hole next to the spark plug 
well and using that as the thermocouple mount? I think as long as you are in 
the aluminum and close to the plug you should get a temp close to that of 
the under plug sensor. You  may want to use a Stainless screw and some 
anti-seize for installation. Lots of temp cycling here. You don't want the 
screw to back out. Even better, maybe, use a fan shroud screw as those are 
5mm and the thread may go in tight on a 10-32 hole.
