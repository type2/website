Subject: Re: [VB] Steering wheel position

Alright, now I'm getting somewhere.

Anthony, I have the same problem. Drag link as short as it can go and yet 
the steering wheel is slightly off. The link needs to be maybe 1 or 2 
threads shorter. Interesting that you tried to move the pittman arm. I've 
thought of that, but never tried it.

E&B, do you know the skinny on drag links? I've been told that spitty drag 
links are no longer available and that the Bay drag links are slightly 
longer. The restoration house that did my bus installed a new drag link.


Best Regards,
Chris
