PayPal donations are currently on hold.  It's been decided that we  
would rather not receive donations until an (-at-)type2.com account is  
available, instead of having funds sent to a non-(-at-)type2.com account.   
The donation page has been updated and we'll keep the list updated as  
soon as everything is straightened out.
