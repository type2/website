Subject: DOUBLE Listmember Discount at BusDepot

Our second-ever Listmember Appreciation Sale begins today.

From now until midnight on Sunday December 14, as a listmember you qualify
for DOUBLE listmember discounts on most orders OVER $100.  This will offset
your shipping cost and then some.  

Use the standard Listmember Discount referral code -  list1e  - on checkout
to get the first 5%.  Then, write DOUBLEDIP in the "comments" section when
checking out, and an ADDITIONAL 5% of your purchase total will be deducted
when we ship your order.  (Note: this extra savings will not be shown in the
price on your web order confirmation, but it will appear on the invoice that
is emailed to you when your order ships and packed in the box.)  You can
also use this discount when phoning an order in. 

What's more, Sale Items and Outlet Store items WILL qualify for the
DOUBLEDIP 5% discount, even though they generally do not qualify for a list
discount.  (However, made-to-order items, special-order items, engines,
transmissions, tires, wheels, prior orders, and gift certificates will not
qualify.)

This discount is for list members only. Please save this email, as the
discount code will not be posted on our site. 

The Bus Depot got its start on the List (way back when
VintageBus/Type2/Vanagon was all one combined list). We wouldn't be here
today if it weren't for many of you.  In this season of thanksgiving, I want
to say that I sincerely appreciate your patronage and support.
