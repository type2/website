Subject: Has anyone installed the WWest rear spring plate, brakeline

Hi,

I went ahead and put the boot on the trans as best I could figure out.  
Now I'm getting everything bolted back up.

How is the WWest rear spring plate, brakeline braket kit supposed to  
be mounted? Anyone on the list installed this kit?

I'm assuming the two hole brake goes on the upper two bolts and the  
braket goes on the lower, but I'm not sure about the orientation.

Thanks,
Conrad
