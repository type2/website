Subject: Re: [VB] Drag Link - need advice

Hi Kemal,
	Good question.  I need to replace the long tie rod on my rhd '66,  
the outer end is shot, and I think that this tie rod is the mirror of  
the one on lhd, the one with fixed ends?  When I pull this rod off I  
can check my drag link with an old LHD drag link.  I'll try to get to  
this in the next week and let you know.  Gary Gibson
