Subject: New location for (exploded) parts manuals?

Hi,

The parts manuals are no longer loading from http://failsure.net/ 
oacdp/ (link from VintageBus.com). Anyone know the location of these?

I'm trying to figure out where to see the details/locations of rubber  
boots on the transmission nose cone (65), or if there is a rubber boot  
between the coupler and the transmission? WWest doesn't like to  
advertise they have trans-related bus parts I guess, as it isn't in  
their (otherwise excellent) catalog.

Thanks,
Conrad
