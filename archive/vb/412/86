Subject: Classifieds on type2.com

Since type2.com's recent move to a new server, the classifieds page  
(aka Buy/Sell) has been down.  Before time is spent to get it back up  
and functional, do any list members have thoughts about whether they  
would like to see it remain as a part of the site, or not?

Some things that come to mind:

1. Larger web entities can require more work on the buyer/sellers  
behalf, can seem cluttered, but may provide more security
2. Having a little corner of the web for list members to engage in  
transactions can be less of a hassle, and help to ensure that only bus  
related items are going to be dealt with.

Thoughts?
