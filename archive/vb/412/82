Subject: Down for 2 days and Wing Window Seal

Hip Hip Hooray for the Admins!
Thanks for all you are doing!

Almost done installing the passenger wing window seal. The fat one. What a 
job.

Removed the door panel.
Carefully drilled out the rivet on the top pivot. Didn't even nick the 
paint.
Bent out the nut keeper and removed the nut, spring and washers on the 
bottom.
Angled the window and lifted it out.
That is one tight seal to install. Took about an hour and a half since it 
was my first time. I even resorted to rubber lube.

There are 2 washers under the seal, one with an oval hole that spins with 
the window and a fiber one the provides friction. Must be in place before 
installing seal, then much frustration in lining up the washer with the oval 
rod and sliding it thru.

Got too cold so I gave up for today. I need to pop the rivet (yeah I know, 
its not supposed to be a pop rivet) tighten up the tension nut and put the 
door panel and handle back in.

Sure happy that I modified my door handles. Got rid of the keeper pin, 
drilled and tapped the spindles. Now I use a nice SS button head screw to 
hold the handles on. Easy off, Easy on.
