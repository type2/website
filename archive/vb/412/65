All grey.

But I have not found a high temp paint that works right.? I have found 500F temp paint, but that will burn off the right heat riser.? The stove store does have 1500 F paint, but not in grey, only in metallic colors.??? The powder coater I use does have high temp version, but not in grey.?? 

FWIW, water helps dissolve carbon to clear out the heat riser.? Clutch cable drilled counterclockways.
