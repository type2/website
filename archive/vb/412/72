On a 65 I did not have to move the trans to replace the shift coupler.?? This style of shifting was used ~VIN 501 xxx through early 1966 models.
On the earlier and the later buses I'd have to either move the tranny back or disconnect the front shift coupler.
But the mid 59 through early 66 kind it was easier to change the rear shift coupler.

I will be attempting to install a new shift coupler in my 65 deluxe westy. Engine is out, middle shift rod connector is frozen, hope I don't have to pull the tranny to make room??
