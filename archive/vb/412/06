Anthony,

So I presume that you moved the pittman arm without adjusting the drag link??
Seems to me that changing the angle of the drag link by one spline could be
compensated by lengthening or shortening the drag link. Maybe I need to try
moving my pittman arm.

I do CAD with Kubotek. I work in 3D solids. Can import from almost any other
cad system and export back. My business is general machinery design and
manufacturing. I also design the control systems and write PLC programs,
LabView programming, C programming and assembly programming on Microchip
controllers.

Chris
