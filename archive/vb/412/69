Hey Tom   If you can't get it apart  . use a screw jack between the body and 
starter m take off the front tranny nuts and the 2 big saddle bolts and 
support with a rolling jack. screw the screw jack so that the tranny moves back 
enough to fix the coupler. This is also how I change the front mount. Also take 
the clutch cable and front ground strap off.  later  Mark d   Merry chrismas
