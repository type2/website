Subject: Re: [VB] Steering wheel position

Hi Chris,
   Should be straight forward toward the windshield, with the  arms of the 
steering wheel at 9 and 3 O'clock.
 
Drop on steering wheel temporarily onto the shaft with the key in  place.  
Turn steering wheel all the way one direction.  Once there  turn opposite 
direction till it stops and count how many turns it takes.   Divide the amount of 
turns by 2.  Then turn back the steering wheel that  many turns.  That is where 
you want the front wheels to be facing straight  forward.
  If wheel are not straight you need to adjust the drag link  length.
 
Not doing the above results in being able to turn tighter in one direction  
than the other.
E&B
