Hi Rusty,
	Most '67s came with a 4.12-1 r&p, a one your only set up before the  
bay windows arrived in '68.  The numbers you give make me think that  
your transaxle has a 4.37-1 ring and pinion.  This is the most common  
set up available.  I drive buses with both r&p and I feel that the  
4.37-1 works best with a stock engine.  I find that I even get better  
mpg with the 4.37-1 r&p driving sane speeds.  You'll pay a bit of a  
premium for a rebuilt transaxle with the 4.12-1 and your bus will go  
faster.  It may be the way to go in today's faster traffic????
