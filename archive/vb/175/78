Problem is all the wiring got pretty "hard", it's very brittle, cracks at every attempt of
bending.... this Bus has spent most of it's life in a warm climate and probably doesn't like the
cold days in Chicago. Looking to check wiring later on and compare with the diagram.... I need wiper
switch!! mine doesn't work at all....won't even move! Another one of those Arizona things... been
never used probably.

Thanks all,
