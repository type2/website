either something is wired wrong at ignition/ headlight switch, or your 
headlight switch is bad.  probably the first, compare to wiring diagram.

 contacts.... now I've got a problem... One - looks like electrical is all 
original and I just
 noticed today that all the wiring is a bit fragile... pretty brittle, wires 
crack when I try
 bending. Second - my taillights are on now even without parking lights on... 
but only when I turn
 ignition key to "ON"...
 how come? check conections up front? parking lights up front don't work.... 
perhaps that's why?
 
 First step was the hardest, now all the fun begins.
