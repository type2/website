FWIW, he has a shop with his shingle out.  ( I was there in 89 and my freind 
borrowed a tool so she could fix her brakes.)  Doesn't that mean he's not a 
shadetree mechanic?   I though that term meant someone who does it as a hobby 
or sideline, rather than a business with location et al.

Hope the replacement engine is better.

 Personally I'd like to see the guy make it right with you so the world
 would keep turning.
 Nobody needs grief, court dates and having their wife on their case.
 
 Stan Wilder, those are my last comments on the subject.
