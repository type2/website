Subject: tranny swap

hello all     I have a 56 fire bus that I want to swap the trans to a later 
style keeping the reduction boxes. The problem seems to be the front nose and 
mount are tottaly different. Anybody out there done this swap and what did 
you do for the front mount.  TIA  later and happy busing   Mark Dearing
