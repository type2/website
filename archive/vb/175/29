Subject: preserving the gold

found a case within a couple of months of the birth month of my 57. Went out
and started to clean it and found it to still be gold under the grease. I'd
like to keep it that way. I asked the guy where I'm having the stuff tanked
if the chemical in the cleaning tank would remove the gold color but he
didn't know. Asking other places the answer was more along the lines of
what difference does it make? So does anyone know if it'll make it through
the cleaning tank? or how to clean it effectively and still keep the gold?
