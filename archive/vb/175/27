Hi guys
    Just wanted to remind you all of our Midwest VW campout
(http://www.bustoberfest.com/2002/index.htm) at Indian Cave State Park
(http://www.ngpc.state.ne.us/parks/icave.html) in the 4-corners of Nebraska,
Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri
(http://www.bustoberfest.com/2001/general_info_icsp_2001__bstf.htm) the
weekend of OCT 25-27.  The park will have haunted Halloween rides
(http://www.bustoberfest.com/images/Bustoberfest-Graphic.jpg) and on Sat.
night there is a Buffalo feed with Buffalo burgers and other goodies. The
www.buskatiers.com with help from local Omaha VW club, The Nebraska VW Club,
the MoKan VW club, and the Missouri Micros are putting on this campout   Still
in the 60's during the day and just touching freezing at night.  PERFECT
camping weather!!!  The trees are changing and most of the leaves are still in
the trees.  Bugs are done and should be a fun time!!
(http://www.bustoberfest.com/images/kokopumpkin.jpg) Hope to see any and all
of you there!
Later    Could someone cross post this to the Type 2 and Vanagon and the
Vintage VW list as I can't?  Any other list that are VW related!?
