Subject: [VB] gas tank felts

Hi All,

With all this info on gas tank dividers...

I'm willing to fork over $50... yes, you read that correctly, $50 for a nice
set of original felts from the gas tank dividers.  The things I'll do to
keep the double cab OG.

If you have them, either give them to Ronnie or send them directly to me.
I'm willing to trade for good stuff as well if that's a better enticement.



David
