Subject: lube it or just go at it dry?

looking into putting together the 36hp motor for the 57, and I've run into
two different schools of thought. Builder number one(factory trained in
germany many years ago when 25/36hp was what there was) says to oil the p's
and c's when assembling the motor, builder number two(many years experience
building stock and race motors, one of the few local builders who's work has
a good rep) says that oiling them helps make an oil burner out of your motor
and that they are best left dry. Opinions?
