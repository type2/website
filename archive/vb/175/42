Subject: hooking up radio 6v to 12v

well i checked out the inverter, thanks to Bob with the info on the tandy
site. I have the battery out of the bus right now, so i hooked up the
inverter up as per the diagram, and hooked my voltmeter up to it-i get a
reading of 13.75V being output. Is this ok, normal? or too high-would it fry
my radio?

Now when i go to hook this up in my bus, I assume I should either hook into
the same fuse as the lighting/starter fuse(far right), always hot. According
to the original wiring diagram-this is where the radio should be hooked up.

Also does the distance from the fuse to the inverter, or the distance from
inverter to radio matter, as long as I use a heavy gauge wire?

Last question this email:
The inverter had a 5 amp inline fuse between the battery positive and the
inverter input positive. The diagram calls for an 8 AMP / 3 AG inline fuse.
I assume using the 5 amp is just a little safer. And what does the 3 AG
mean?

Thanks
