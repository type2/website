Subject: Re: [VB] Oil pressure dropped

No, air cooled engines do not tend to have a steady oil light on when the oil 
level is at the bottom line.   I also wondered what conditions you were 
driving under- ie was it hot, after a long freeway drive.   

The way the oil cooler is mounted may well mean that the oil drains into the 
engine when the engine is off.   Do you have enough tubing that it sort of 
loops up at each end off the cooler so the oil can't drain back down?   
Because with a cooler (and filter) you need more oil in it than a stock set 
up.  Actually, your engine may really be lower than down to the bottom line 
when you factor those conditions in.  If there is too little oil in the sump, 
so the pick up tube cant reach it, the oil light will come on.

 one of the side vents such that it is elevated above the fan shroud. 
 When the oil level was at the bottom line of the dipstick (one quart 
 low), the oil pressure just shut down. I noticed it quickly and shut 
 the engine down. After adding a quart of oil, the pressure came back. 
 The question is: are the upright engines prone to shutting down the oil 
 pressure when the oil level is only one quart low? If not, what could 
 be the contributing factors? Could it be the external cooler or 
 something else? Would an add-on sump help?
