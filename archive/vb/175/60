Subject: Oil pressure dropped

My 1600 single port H cased engine had the oil light come on steady. It 
has an external cooler and spin on filter. The cooler is mounted near 
one of the side vents such that it is elevated above the fan shroud. 
When the oil level was at the bottom line of the dipstick (one quart 
low), the oil pressure just shut down. I noticed it quickly and shut 
the engine down. After adding a quart of oil, the pressure came back. 
The question is: are the upright engines prone to shutting down the oil 
pressure when the oil level is only one quart low? If not, what could 
be the contributing factors? Could it be the external cooler or 
something else? Would an add-on sump help?


Remember OCTO is on Sunday.

Thanks,

Rocky
