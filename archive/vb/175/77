Subject: [VB] Gold color, one more idea.

Berg calls it "pickling", granted that is not a very technical explanation 
to the gold appearance of some new magnesium cases.  This pickling does not 
need taken off though.  Just build it up.

I like mine flat black as a color as Bill Fisher would smile upon.  Also in 
a B&W photo in the Berg parts cataloge you will see Gene next to an early 
motor and I think it is flat black as well.

Also I think the gold colored magnesium looks bad.  But that is subjective.

Take Care,
Adrian
