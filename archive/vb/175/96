hm, when I have had a stuck switch, using a bit if liquid wrench sometimes 
works.around where the stem for the knob pokes out.

Sounds like you'ld probably want to remove the wiper motor and regrease it.  
The motor in my 61 got noisy.   The grease inside was almost solid.   New 
grease quieted it down.  The one in my 65 just moaned in pain, after greasing 
it moves smoothly and almost silently. (both have voltage drops)

sucks about the wires cracking- but you still might want to check a wiring 
diagram.   Hell, if it is cracking everywhere that bad you might want to get 
a new wiring harness.   I mean, oil does do the plastic in, so the wires 
crack if they were oily a lot, and I;ve often seen cracked wires in the 
engine compartment.  But cracked wires up front?   Ouch.   I think this is 
the only time I've recommended getting a new harness, usually people when 
think they need one things are hooked up wrong and/or bad grounds & 
connections.   But 40 years of outgassing in the heat might have done yours 
in. 
     I wonder if applying glycerin would help.  It really helped the non 
flexible real vinyl leatherette seats in my 53 that had been in hot E WA for 
40 yrs become supple.

diagram.... I need wiper
 switch!! mine doesn't work at all....won't even move! Another one of those 
Arizona things... been
 never used probably.
 
 Thanks all,
