Subject: Re: [VB] preserving the gold

If the case is aluminum, the gold color could be anodizing or even a 
chemical film. If the case is magnesium, it could be pickled and 
sealed. We have found (in the aerospace industry) that anodizing has 
held up well to stripping chemicals but chem film and sealers may be 
harmed.
