Subject: RE: [VB] preserving the gold

  I have a giant parts washer that I use to clean everything. It's like a
enclosed pressure washer/steamcleaner. Cleans a greasey engine case in ten
minutes. Take your case to a trans shop or good machine shop, they should
have a parts washer. Tanks usually have heavy castic chemicals that will EAT
anything off of what's put in it.

Subject: [VB] preserving the gold


found a case within a couple of months of the birth month of my 57. Went out
and started to clean it and found it to still be gold under the grease. I'd
like to keep it that way. I asked the guy where I'm having the stuff tanked
if the chemical in the cleaning tank would remove the gold color but he
didn't know. Asking other places the answer was more along the lines of
what difference does it make? So does anyone know if it'll make it through
the cleaning tank? or how to clean it effectively and still keep the gold?
