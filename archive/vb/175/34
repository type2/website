Subject: Re: [VB] Repro taillights - update

OK, I got them yesterday... installed them today. I had to run an extra wire for ground but
otherwise it was no biggie. Installation went smooth and I only had to tweak a little one of the
contacts.... now I've got a problem... One - looks like electrical is all original and I just
noticed today that all the wiring is a bit fragile... pretty brittle, wires crack when I try
bending. Second - my taillights are on now even without parking lights on... but only when I turn
ignition key to "ON"...
how come? check conections up front? parking lights up front don't work.... perhaps that's why?

First step was the hardest, now all the fun begins.
