  David in looking at the pictures of the divider panels the one you have
labled as late is the same style that came out of my 1960 DC. The ones you
have labled as early are the same as the ones out of a 57 single cab I
parted.

  So Maybe early is split case tranny buses?

Hi All,

Last night, I was going to install the gas tank divider plates even though
the last of 4 screws for the plates still have to go off to the chrome
shop... anyway, when I pulled out the two covers, I noticed that the one I
found as a replacement for my one crusty one is that of a later bus.  Follow
the link below to a web page with a picture of the two.  So, I'm in search
of one divider panel which I would gladly pay for, trade for the later
divider panel, or accept as a charitable contribution (yea right :-) )

Also, I noticed that my one crusty panel I have has remnants of a felt
material similar to that of the anti rattle strips that go between the gas
tank and hold down straps which makes me wonder if the correct gasket
material for these plates is a felt material or is a rubber gasket similar
to the fresh air vent cover.

Anyone know when these plates changed?  The 67 tipper has those of even a
different style as can be seen on the tipper web page in the picture showing
the hydraulic pump.

Thoughts, answer, replies....???

David
