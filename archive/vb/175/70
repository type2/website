Subject: RE: [VB] preserving the gold

  Joe Ruiz aka Mr Okrsasa knows someone that does the process to replate?
the cases gold. I looked for his underground web site and couldn't find it.
So if you do loose the gold he can have it redone. A friend of mine is
sending Joe his 25 hp case to be done.

I know David "got the right screw" knows where his site is
