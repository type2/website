Subject: Virus warning

Hi folks.  It seems that a virus sent itself to VeeWee111 claiming to be sent 
by me.   This possibly means that someone on the list has a virus.   SO 
please do not open any emails with pics embedding in them or attachments, 
unless you know for sure it is clean of viruses.   
If anyone sends me a email with a pic embedded in it, I do not open it, 
unless I get a regular email clearly from a human saying it will arrive.  
Neither do I open attachments, except I am sure it is sent by a real person.

Be warned that a virus may soon be sending itself to you!
