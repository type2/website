You may be syphoning the oil in the cooler and filter back to the sump,
which would make the level artificially high.  If your oil level magically
gains a quart between a reading just after shutdown and a reading an hour
or two later this might be it.

I'd fix this problem before applying band-aids like the deep sump.
