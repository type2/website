Subject: wheel alignment

Ok, so my front wheels are completely out of whack.  Have been for a good
long time, and I have one tire bald on one edge to prove it.  Are there
specs for doing the alignment with a machine?  I want to do it at school
(taking auto mechanics) with the computer.  Is this possible?  Any
recommendations?

ps.  I'm pretty clueless about wheel alignment, sorry if these are totally
ridiculous questions.
