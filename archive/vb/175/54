CIS is an analog fuel injection rig, that is supposed to be awesome with
DP heads. I do not think you can use it with SP. Ted?

!what is CIS.

!I have some relatives in the UK,so if they are available there, i could
get a few and then have them shipped over. but i wouldn't dare, unless
someone had some real life experiment with them.



!if you can't use the oil bath air cleaner-maybe that alone makes a
difference. In a recent test drive of my bus-i didn't have the oil bath
air cleaner-and there was a noticable difference in throttle response. i
cleaned the filter out(or tried to anyway with kerosene)about 1.5 years
ago, maybe it is so clogged that it is affecting performance.
