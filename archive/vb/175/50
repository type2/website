what is CIS.
I have some relatives in the UK,so if they are available there, i could get
a few and then have them shipped over. but i wouldn't dare, unless someone
had some real life experiment with them.

if you can't use the oil bath air cleaner-maybe that alone makes a
difference. In a recent test drive of my bus-i didn't have the oil bath air
cleaner-and there was a noticable difference in throttle response. i cleaned
the filter out(or tried to anyway with kerosene)about 1.5 years ago, maybe
it is so clogged that it is affecting performance.

I tried to get one, then gave up after about a month. Also, you can't
use the oil bath cleaner, according to them.
If you do searches for FISH CARBS, you willl find some vintage articles
about them. Someone described (I think they are on this list) having one
on a Datsun years ago, and got goo dmileage and crisp throttle response.
Can't be as good as CIS though.
The hours labor/price point doesn't seem to matchup, that's a good
point.
