They weren't last weekend. Traffic was TERRIBLE!!!! We went for a wedding 
in Pigeon Forge.

We did not go up into the park so I don't know if the leaves are changing 
at the higher altitudes.

I would recommend entering through Townsend, Wears Valley, and then Pigeon 
Forge, and then finally to Gatlinburg via the by-pass. Lots of directions 
changing but not an hour of traffic each way like we did last weekend. Your 
clutch leg will be happier for it.

I don't know of any junkyards up there but that doesn't mean that they 
aren't there somewhere.

Beware of tourist prices.
