Subject: Re: [VB] Tips on nose replacement needed

Nose was hit on the driver's side mostly and that's where all the mess is. "A" pillar has not been
fixed right..... as Ronnie described it "A-pillar was sculptured out of bondo" so it clearly can not
hold the weight of the door.... hinges were bent for some reason. I think that I should just take
nose skin off to inspect it further. "A" pillar has to go - easier done when nose is off.... and
then it will be a lot easier to measure everything out to make sure door fits right.
right?

It's not just about driving it no matter what. I enjoy my Bus a lot but I would also like it to be
"perfect". It just doesn't feel right for me when I know there are things that are wrong with it. It
must look good, perform well for me to feel good in it.

| If the nose skin is crumply AND the frame around it is bent, it makes sense
