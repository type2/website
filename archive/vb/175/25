Subject: Re: [VB] gas tank divider plates and gaskets...

Hey david
the ones I call late are these (starting in 66)

Which also coincides with the parts books and are also the same as your 67.

the ones you call "early" are the same as the ones in my 57sc and my 58 binz

Im not sure about what the ones go to that you call "late"... 60-65
possibly?

And yes, the dividers used the same felt strap down material that the gas
tank used,  for the divider seal. I could take a picture of mine if you
want. I think the later ones changed to a rubber gasket.
