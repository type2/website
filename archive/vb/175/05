Subject: RE: [VB] wheel alignment

The '59 workshop manual has a very nice section on doing alignments.
Realize that toe in is easy to do but caster adjustment requires changing
the shims in the link pins.

Ok, so my front wheels are completely out of whack.  Have been for a good
long time, and I have one tire bald on one edge to prove it.  Are there
specs for doing the alignment with a machine?  I want to do it at school
(taking auto mechanics) with the computer.  Is this possible?  Any
recommendations?
