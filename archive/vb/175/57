Well, this is my last post about this beat topic until I get some cash,
will probably be never.

Don't quit posting about this.
Get your complaint well documented in the archives in Vintage Bus, Type2
List, Vanagon List and Wet Westies.
If you want to shut this guy down be sure you kill all his future sales
to list members.
Even if the list members numbers might seem small, there are many
non-members and lurkers that rely on list members for recommendations.
You can win your case in court if Bob just refuses to negotiate some
replacement or settlement. 
The courts expect to be the last resort for your recovery and the judges
don't like it when you bring a case in that could have been arbitrated
outside the court.
Be sure that you record your communications with registered letters and
plenty of notes.
If he fails to respond to your written communications it just tells the
court that he refuses to even try to work out a settlement.
Telephone communications are good but documentation clearly stating your
complaint and your request for reasonable warranty or adjustment is the
ammunition the court respects.
If you go to court without written communication copies you're wasting
your filing fee and court house parking fee.
