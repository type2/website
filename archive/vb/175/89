Subject: doublethrust cam bearings

a heads-up:
i just ordered some copper-faced doublethrust cam bearings from 
berg... tim told me thay can no longer get these, and berg co. went 
and bought all the SINGLE thrust copperface sets from a local dealer, 
and to get a doublethrust set i had to buy two. about $75, shipped. 
ouch.

however, if you want these (and i think they are worth the $$), i'd 
stock up on a set for future use. jeesh, first these, then singleport 
heads... next they'll stop making busses ;P
