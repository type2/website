I've said about all I can about the situation.
I think you've said about all there is to say about a shade tree mechanic
............. quick bucks for stuff from his junk box.
Personally I'd like to see the guy make it right with you so the world
would keep turning.
Nobody needs grief, court dates and having their wife on their case.

Stan Wilder, those are my last comments on the subject.
