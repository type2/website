Subject: Re: [VB] Repro taillights.

That's no problem. I did pick-up new sockets... sockets on original taillights were wasted. Now I
need to somehow cut a round hole in the base unit. Out of both lenses I was able to save one....
well, two halves of it but the other one has been chipped all around too much. I'm on a scavenger
haunt for good original lenses... Hella's lenses.... and will just keep these original taillights in
case I need them later.

New WW repro taillights arrived yesterday. They look pretty good. Metal of the base seems to be
painted with clearcoat.. rust protection? I have not opened them yet so I don't know how the inside
looks. I shall be able to install them later today. Lenses are not even close to original ones but
as we know, these are repros, right? Lenses are plastic, not glass.... I think these taillights look
good. At least now I'll have working lights.... but will still need to refurbish headlights now.

thanks all for opinions.

peace,

| If the sockets are wasted you can go down to your local auto parts store and
