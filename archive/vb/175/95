Subject: Izzy's mirrors or Finding Flat Four mirrors...

I was driving back out the Gorge from Portland OR the other day and
looked in my mirror to change lanes. A second later I took another peak
and it took me a minute to figure out what was wrong. There was no
mirror! It simply fell off in the wind. I have a pair of Izzy's mirrors
(I should say had a pair). I have been looking for a way to get ahold of
Izzy's whithout any luck. You can clearly see that the rivet inside the
mirror was either not long enough or was not pressed out enough to hold.
The other side is getting loose as well. I really like the look of the
Flat Four mirrors as well and would be interested in a pair of those but
I have not been able to track those down either. They are not listed on
the Moon Eyes website and they are distributing Flat Four now. Any help
finding a contact number for Izzy's or finding a set of Flat Four
mirrors would be apreciated.
thanks
