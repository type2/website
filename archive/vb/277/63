When I was in an apartment I had three busses,
one squareback, and a motorcycle, and all of
them were under the carports, but I was only
allowed one carport space. I kept watch on the
use of the carports and just moved into ones
that were unoccupied. If the management caught
on, I moved elsewhere. I did this for 5 years.
Find the out-of-the way undesirable ones.

As for restoration, do a bit at a time, and 
leave it in an "acceptable" and secure condition 
after every chunk of work. Pull a window, and 
fix the channels, rattle can prime and paint.
Re-install the window as soon as the paint allows.

Try to find a space against the side wall to try
to obscure the work going on. Of course "acceptable"
is a very subjective term and needs to be tempered
with local reality and the manager's whims.

I used an adjacent bus to store parts.
To be successful, you have to get organized,
take something with just the needed tools, so
you can make a quick haul back to the apartment.

An engine can be taken inside with help. Protect 
the apartment floor with plywood. Drain the oil 
while in the bus. It does help to be on the 
ground floor!

Gotta be creative. Interior work can be done
fairly inconspicuously.

This will work for almost everything until you get
to the final remove-everything to paint step.

Jeff wishing he had the bus from then, sigh
