  The only fulcrums that I have new are oversize. Still trying to get axle
paddles blanchard ground in order to use these. Fulcrums (good ones) are
getting harder and harder to find as well as end gears and bus axles. It's
time for all of you to pull the endgears and fulcrums from all those junk
trannies you got laying in the yard getting filled with water before they
are junk. CB Performance has NEW end gears and fulcrums I have heard, but
are VERY PRICEY.

ps. ERCO (ads in HVW) is another good source for tranny parts

I think Ronnie carries them, too.  And probably Long Enterprises.
