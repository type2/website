Sorry to be negative without suggestions...

Better to NOT drill a hole in your dash.  Countless people say countless
things while they weld/replace dashes that previous owners have cut for
things like gauges, switches, CD players, etc.

Your bus will love you for having you love it stock/uncut.

Couple things you can do:

1.  Be at one with your bus...write down your mileage in a nice logbook
where you can also keep your oil change mileage, maintenance reports, bus
ideas, trip logs, etc.  It is a very organic way to monitor your tank.  It
also will tell you if your bus is still as good as it was 3, 6, 12, 18+
months ago, and give you ideas on how to keep it in great shape.

2.  If your reserve tap is missing or not working, get one!  This works well
with suggestion #1

3.  Make a wooden panel that you can affix between your dash and parcel
tray.  This is a good place to put gauges/switches.  I'll send you a couple
pics of that idea in action.  None of these panels required holes in the
dash.  There were holes (stock I believe) for the upper gauge panel, and the
switch panel and lower gauge panel are held in place by double-sided 1/16"
gel tape.  The tack is just clamped in place.

4.  Get a bus with a stock fuel gauge, and sell your 58 to me!


Rock on!
