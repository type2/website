Subject: Re: [VB] Gas gauge installation

Personally I would put in some starter holes with a large drill bit, 
then use a Dremel to connect the dots and finish the opening to the 
correct size.

Be careful about exactly where you cut your hole.  The gas gauge has a 
chrome bezel that conforms specifically to the curvature of the dash. 
Put the hole in the wrong place and the gauge might not lie flat when 
you screw it down.
