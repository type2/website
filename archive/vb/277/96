Ach, it seems like sacrilege.   

Get a hole saw of the size hole you want, which is the size of the gauge 
diameter,  available at a place they sell tools.   It has a drill bit down the 
middle, and a round thing with saw teeth round the outside.     Find where you 
want to place your gauge, and with a nail and hammer make a little dimple in the 
middle.   Put the hole saw bit on your drill, and place the middle thing in 
the dimple and drill.   The drill will make a hole in the middle, then drop 
down and cut the bigger circle out.   You'll end up with a circle off metal stuck 
on the drill. Save the circle for when you want the hole to go away, so it 
can be welded back in.  File the edges of the dash hole just enough to get rid 
of any sharp bits that might cut you with a big round file.    

Don't worry about exactly where the gauge goes stock.   The 58 I pulled the 
sender/guage out of had it slightly off.   It wasn't factory installed, the 
hole wasn't painted on the inside, and had cloth wiring (unlike the camper with 
the clock, which was factory installed)

Still, check out the 14 4 cable for running the wiring back to the sender, 
and for any other guages/etc you may want to add later you'll find it convenient 
to have wires already run back there in a safe insulated kind of way.

Ok, Thanks everyone for the advice on how not to cut my dash.  I am going to
do it anyways.  My original question was for help in the actual cutting
process.  I have sorted that out.  Can anyone supply me with the location of
the factory hole for a gas guage.  This is a '58 panel.  I understand that I
