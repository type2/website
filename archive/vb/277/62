Subject: 62 SC drive report to appear in Hemmings

I was contacted recently by one of the editors for SIA magazine, (Special interest autos) which is
published by Hemmings bi-monthly since the 70s. They are doing a road test report on a 62 single cab
and had a couple questions. Look for the report in the December issue! (which may be out in
october/november, depending on what month theyre on now).
