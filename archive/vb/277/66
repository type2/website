Subject: Gas gauge installation

I bought an original bus gas gauge at a swapmeet last weekend.  My '58 does
not have the hole in the dash for one, but I was thinking I sure would like to
have one there.  Where would I take my bus to have the hole drilled?  I guess
this is probably not somethin I can do myself.  Carbide tipped hole saw?
Anyone, anyone....
