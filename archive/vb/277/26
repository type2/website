Excuse me.  I have 205 75 R15s on the rear of my 61.  Flat wheel wells.  
There isn't much clearance when putting them on, but it's fine once they are 
there.  You have to jack the bus up pretty high.  No big deal.  Been running them 
for years.

  I like them.

Are you saying these will not fit on my '58?
