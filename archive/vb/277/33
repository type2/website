Damn boy...leave those 'new' 14" rims for you 'new' bus guys...hehe

Anyways.....On my 63 I run 215/75/15's (rear) with no probs whatsoever.  Another SV2's friend of mine runs 215's on his 59 DD panel.  He says it's tight getting them on, but once on, no issues whatsoever.  

If you're getting those 205's for cheap or free, they will do the trick.  I run 205's on all my buses with the exception of this one, 205's front and 215's on the back.
