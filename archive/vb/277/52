I'll second that thought. My "first wife"(Utah joke) & I had a good time,
especially when we weren't trying to sleep! Next time earplugs.  Thank god
that the volks next to us passed out at 3:15 am while they were waiting for
another group of volks to "go get the keg & bring it over here" on Saturday
nite!!!

On another issue, I took a pic of the cartoon that Kyle won for $400 & it's
a Zits classic worth sharing, if that doesn't violate copyright/Unca jerry's
obligation to the author, etc. What is the ethical thing to do here?
