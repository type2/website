I had a similar issue in my 67 riviera.   I bumped some wires at the 9 pin 
box when installing the kick panel..   I took the kick panel off, and wiggled 
the wires at the 9 pin box, I think 2 had touched or something, and then it was 
fine.
  the headlights do have something that runs through the 9 pin box, so I see 
a connection there.  Check your high beam light on the dash is grounded 
(wiggle socket)  and works properly.
yes, check that all you turn signals work properly.

Since it was reassembled following a paint job, the turn signal 
flasher clicks irregularly as I am driving.  Doesn't do it at all when 
sitting still, even with the engine running.  It seemed to chatter more 
with the right turn signal on, so I went looking for loose wires, etc.  
Found a completely disconnected right taillight wire, and fixed it.  
Also discovered that there was a ground problem with the front right 
blinker, and I think I fixed that.  Sure that I had solved the problem, 
I was disappointed that it doesn't seem much changed.

One additional discovery: The clicking stops when the headlights are on!
