A fair cop.  I woulda thought that this one at least partly answers it:  http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/069034.html. Also maybe 
http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/031910.html.  But my apologies if I'm incorrect.  There is a lot of stuff under "fulcrum wear" in the 
archives.

I probably picked on your message unnecessarily.  Call it even? :-)
