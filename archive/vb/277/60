I agree, now how do youse get the bus in the living room?

You must also be single w/ no chance for a SO!

Tom Buese-spouse got tired of looking at the 65 Deluxe Westy? behind the
garage in the back yard w/ a tarp over the front, & said "lets put the
windshields in, reorient it for the view, & turn it into a cocktail lounge
until you get it running"! Now I can't keep the college kids from drinking
all my beer in it, ask Mike Anderson.
