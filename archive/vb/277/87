If it were, wouldn't there be an M-code -- which the gaugeless bus doesn't have?  Not everyone is a vintage nazi, but this seems yet another good 
argument against not cutting the dash.  Now if you can find good documentation, *maybe*....

Of course, if dealer options/accessories are your guide, with VWs the sky's just about the limit, eh?  As long as it "looks correct/period"?
