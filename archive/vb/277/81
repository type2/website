Subject: jerome jamboree xiii

jon and i started toward jerome thursday morning at about 6am.  jon had given j.p. a tentative on our camping with him and a group of other bus popel that night in the forest of flagstaff; it all depended on how well we held up and if we made good time, two things that can be difficult to do in a pair of old vws.  traffic and wind favored us and we made the campsite around 9pm.

the next morning, after sleeping in some, we had breakfast and gassed up our rides in town before heading towards jerome.  i don't have much to add about being at jerome other to say that i had a great time!

most of the drive to and from jerome i followed behind jon's '56 standard and it was fun to bring up the rear.  i saw people give the standard a long, hard look undoubted thinking, "i haven't seen one of those things in years."  they'd watch the standard drive by then along i'd come in the '56 single cab!

we had only four minor difficulties during the trip, two incidents apiece.  on the way out jon's standard had fuel delivery issues that were pretty much resolved by driving slower.  my truck's choke element fell out of the carburetor, wiring the choke open fixed the situation temporarily.

on the way back jon's standard started to leak oil from some place in the engine compartment, fortunately the leak wasn't so bad that he had to add any oil.  my truck taught me the value of keeping my eyes on the road.  we left jerome on a primitive, unpaved but very scenic road towards williams - it was so beautiful that i took my eyes off the road ahead and admired the scenery... just long enough to get stuck in a ditch!  three attempts, a towrope and the standard pulled my truck out of the ditch.  the only casualty was the driver's side slider glass which seems a small price to pay for a lesson from which we *all* can learn!  http://home.csumb.edu/~holl1802/gif.s/sc/trouble.jpg
