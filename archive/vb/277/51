Ya, slop in the FP/Crown gear/axle shaft area means you feel it when you 
suddenly step on or off the clutch or the gas, a thunk from the back, if the wear 
is bad enough.

Why not just buy NEW GENUINE VW fulcrum plates with NO

Since this is not really a fun job to do twice,especially if it's 
re-installed in the bus, why not put the best parts in the first time, rather than
marginal used stuff.
