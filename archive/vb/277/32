Archives.  Look for posts from Clara and Eric & Barb, who gave me tons of help this past spring.  Just search for "fulcrum plates".  Clara has a whole 
rap on swapping & flipping them, checking for wear, etc.

<grumble>Not picking on VWguy in particular, but we need to be more aggressive sometimes about pushing people to the archives, especially when 
the topic has been so recently overhauled.  I contributed some bandwidth when swapping my tranny, true, but IIRC it was mostly "can you clarify 
what I found in the archives?"</grumble>
