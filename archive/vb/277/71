Subject: Re:cargo door rust

Actually I do the outside cargo door skins as well, their just not listed on
the parts page, as aren't alot of newer parts I've started working on. These
include single and double cab inner posts, the tank cover strips along the
floor. I'm also working on inner treasure chest structures, and skins for
the treasure chest doors as well. I have also refined the inner be-pillars
left and right so that they are one piece, the side wall posts are now one
piece, and the inner post at the rear cargo door is also one piece. I hope
to have the new parts page up soon. later
