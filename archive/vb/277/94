Subject: Bus on NBC

After almost 20 years of shooting video, I finally shot a story that
involved (well sorta) a VW bus.  They gave it to me...wonder why ;-)  OK
it wasn't a splittie, but it was a Westy ('74).  Bright orange and butt
ugly with a face only a bay window lover could appreciate, but never the
less it was one of the family.

We are doing actor profiles for a new show to dibut on NBC called
"Coupling".  The owner Colin Fergueson was cool and really does use it
to camp and hang out.  Not too many "Hollywood" actors are cool enough
to own, let alone brag about owning a VW bus.  Great guy.  Not sure
about the show he is in, but it is a remake of a BBC show...arn't they
all?? ;-)

Not sure when the piece will air, but I'm sure sometime this month near
the time "Coupling" premiers.  Check your local listings for Access
Hollywood if you're interested.  In big markets its daily (-at-) 7:30pm on NBC.

Just thought I'd share :-)
