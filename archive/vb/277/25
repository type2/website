Subject: Electrical Problem

Hi guys and girls!

The subject line should be enough to scare off all but the hardiest 
listees, but I am hoping I can get some advice on a strange problem 
with my 67 bus.

  Since it was reassembled following a paint job, the turn signal 
flasher clicks irregularly as I am driving.  Doesn't do it at all when 
sitting still, even with the engine running.  It seemed to chatter more 
with the right turn signal on, so I went looking for loose wires, etc.  
Found a completely disconnected right taillight wire, and fixed it.  
Also discovered that there was a ground problem with the front right 
blinker, and I think I fixed that.  Sure that I had solved the problem, 
I was disappointed that it doesn't seem much changed.

One additional discovery: The clicking stops when the headlights are on!

Anybody have any ideas?
