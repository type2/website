Subject: looking for volksfest swapper... white bay double cab?

Hi All,

 

To anyone that was at the volksfest 2003 in Naches this past weekend.
there was a guy there with two gas tank divider plates that Clara tells
me they HAD FELTS!!!  Now, I almost have enough to do the double cab but
I do need more to do the pedal pan.  So, you all can obviously
understand my keen desire to find this person!  The person was
supposedly driving a white bay window double cab.

 

Anybody with any leads???

 

Thanks

David
