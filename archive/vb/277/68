Here's another data point for you.  I just picked up my yearly copy of 
the "Old Cars Price Guide" today, here's what it has for this year's 
ballpark estimates for a 1962 Deluxe Bus (doesn't say if it's with or 
without sunroof):

1--trailer queen, never driven:  $25500
2--excellent original or superior resto:  $17900
3--good amateur resto, presentable & serviceable:  $10200
4--deteriorated resto, but driveable:  $5100
5--needs complete resto, but not wrecked:  $3060
6--parts car:  $1020

So maybe your bus is somewhere between #4 and #5?
