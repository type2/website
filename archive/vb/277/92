Subject: gauge location - factory hole

Ok, Thanks everyone for the advice on how not to cut my dash.  I am going to
do it anyways.  My original question was for help in the actual cutting
process.  I have sorted that out.  Can anyone supply me with the location of
the factory hole for a gas guage.  This is a '58 panel.  I understand that I
should not cut my dash and the ramiifications of doing this.  Honestly volks,
my bus has already had a rough life, heck, judging from the weld about 1 inch
from the floor pan, all the way around my bus, it may not have started life as
a panel anyways.  I would just like my bus to LOOK as stock as possible, while
still being functional.  So, if anyone can help me out with some measurements
of where the stock hole is located that would be spiffy.
