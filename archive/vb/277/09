Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome Jamboree XIII

Jerome has always been a great campout, a fun swapmeet, and on top of that 
something very special. Lots of things to do while one's awake: you could comb 
the swap, cook/eat/shoot the breeze with friends, check out the raffle bus, 
vote for the busses, watch the slow drag, win some raffle prizes, etc etc. These 
are typical of a bus campout (except the raffle bus - Arizona Bus Club is the 
only one raffling off a bus at 50
