Subject: Re: [VB] Gas gauge installation

I think you guys are misunderstanding me.  I want to put the hole in the
stock location.  Did they not offer a gas gauge as an option in '58?  I
could easily put the gauge in the same pod as the rest of mine, but then I
should have just bought some cheesy aftermarket gauge.  This is the stock
VDO unit.
