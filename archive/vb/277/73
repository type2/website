No probs.
I'll post a link as soon as I get home from work.
The way things stand with my '67 panel, the gas guage
on it has been busted.
It has no glass & the needle is missing as well.
I'm considering blocking the hole with a flat metal
plate behind & putty on top, sanding it to contour to
the dash & then using a VDO or Speco aftermarket unit
in the roof pod.
Thing is, the pod already will have oil temp &
pressure guages, a volt meter & a tacho so I think it
may get a little crowded.
The tacho is likely to be bigger than the 2 & 1/16
inch guages & so the pod will probably have to bulge
in one place to fit it, which will look tres' cool but
take up room.
Now all I need to fit is the switches & bezel lights
for the retro rockets, landing gears and auto pilot &
then I can use that little bunk in the back while on
long cross country trips..........
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
