Chris,

Your suspicions are prolly correct - any strange dealings from people in
wierd places ARE strange. Do your deals locally with people you can call
and or visit. There have been scams where large money amounts are
transferred, then cancelled by the recipient, and the payer loses the
money, and the receiver can't be traced, nor can the 'paper trail'.
