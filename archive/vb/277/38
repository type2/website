Hi there,
    My bus, 67 , does the same thing and it happens when there is no load on
the flasher, mine usually means i have a loose connection in my right rear
tailight. I go wiggle it, and the flasher returns to normal. So, i'd check
all of your wires, on all four lights, and make sure the connections are
tight, also ckeck the bulbs too, a burned out one will do the same thing.
