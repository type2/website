Subject: quick bus update

hi all, just got through putting the lower dash thingie in, that was very 
tiring. then i found out that it has to be off in order for me to put the 
ignition switch back in!! man am i mad! oh well it will give me more 
experience with vw's.
then i lookd at my cargo doors, and the bottom of them has rust holes. now i 
have to try to find those. hopefully someone in my vw club will have a pair 
that they can spair. also how can i turn the miles down on the speedometer? 
i dont want the origional twenty thousand some odd miles to be shown on the 
new engine whenever it is that i get one. thanks in advance,
                                                     josh 1967 panel convert
