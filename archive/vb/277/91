hi all,
    i just got through sanding the roof of my '67. it wasnt that bad of rust 
but it hurts my friggen hands. i will try to get some pics of it when my 
aunt gets her digital camera working again. i also popped the dents on the 
roof back out, i had to take the wood panel out from the camper kit. im goin 
to sleep in her tonight. well thats the update for now,
                                        josh 1967 panel convert
                                         "she will soon be reborn"  \X/
