Subject: Tranny question

I'm putting an old center section in my bus that I've had laying around. The
fulcrum plates I'm putting in it have some wear on one side (the long flat
side running from front to back of the car, not the short side where I would
expect it). I was going flip them putting them back in. Which side gets the
wear, the long side facing the RGB or the side facing the pinion?
