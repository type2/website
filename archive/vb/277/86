Subject: re gas guage before 62

if you look at the gas guage parts, they have 271 part numbers on them, 
because they are ambulance parts.   Like ambulance fans ( and frosted glass and 
divider) these were standrad on ambulances.  the pre 62 gas guages go from 
'EMPTY' to FULL', (or RES to VOLL, and I've seen one in spanish too)   rather than R 
to 1/1. I have seen factory installed ambulance fans in non ambo, and factory 
installed clocks in non deluxes, so why not gas guages in non ambulances?    
I pulled a screw terminal gas sender dated 2/ 57 out of a 58 standard.

was writ:

  It may have been a dealer option, but I don't believe it was a factory
option.

> stock location.  Did they not offer a gas gauge as an option in '58?  I
