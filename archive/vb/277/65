Subject: cargo door rust

I searched for cargo doors for a while, but I just didn't have the funds to
meet the asking prices.  Then I turned to Kelly the  "Metal Wizard". He can
manufacture and sell you the bottom 2" or so of the inside of the doors (the
outer lower skins can be purchased through most bus sheet metal suppliers).
You need to do some fabricating to get them to fit but they do a fine job of
repairing the rust damage. I'm about to weld mine in any day now.

They're a great low-cost alternative to buying a set of doors (try finding a
set without the same rust yours already have).

Good luck,
