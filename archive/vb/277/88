Gang,

65 bus, Original(I think)tranny(6V bellhousing looks like it was clearanced for 12V flywheel with a 12V flywheel), 1600sp AE case.

Last week while pulling away from a stop, a banging like thor's hammer came from the back of the bus. It was fast and loud. I limped to a stop.

Engine was still running fine. 

I had it towed home, pulled the engine yesterday expecting to find destroyed clutch parts.

TO bearing, pressure plate, all looked fine.

Can somebody help me figure out how to diagnose the situation with the tranny and/or axles/wheels/rgb's?

Thanks,

Billy
