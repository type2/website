Craig,
	I forgot to mention that I was turning both camshafts without the 
crank installed.  The german dished cam jumped solely from its contact 
with the oil pump gear.  So, I wonder what that is all about?  The og 
mexican cam turned smoothly.  The next question would go to what Craig 
mentions, does anyone sell "adjust-a-gear" dish style cam gears?  That 
would help with the -/+ fun!  Gary Gibson
