Subject: Re: [VB] differences in speedometers

we tried this yesterday and it did not work, again:
Chris we are using a mph 68ish bug speedo with gas gauge in our 59 ddr 
w/t because of the PO and we like the gas gauge without making any new 
holes. But we did have to make a larger hole in the parcel tray to help 
with the cable alignment.  We also run 205/75/15s and the speedo is 
right on. Also the 15 gal. bay tank gauge is also accurate.
So if you like a bug KM/H could be easier to find.
P & C

  find one that has km's instead of mph.
