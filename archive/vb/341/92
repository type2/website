Hi Bob,

I have a Southwind(which I think is the same as a Stewart Warner?). I'm also
going to be installing it in my '65 bus in the coming weeks. This is where I
got my installation instructions:

Check out http://vw.itgo.com/

Or http://pages.prodigy.net/busbarn/southwind.html
 
The second site is Rick Taylor I believe...he also carries original manuals
for installation, and maintenance. I forget the cost.
