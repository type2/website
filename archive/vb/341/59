Subject: RE: [VB] door window questions

Just rebuilding front doors and window frames
on my ex-crusty crew cab myself....

I was wondering if anyone knows a source for (repro)
vent window tabs that the latch closes against?  The
little plate thingo thats riveted to the frame for the
latch to close against, originally chrome.  Mine were just 
rusty toast.  I could make some replacements  from stainless if the
worst came to worst - just wondering if repros are around.

Unless you have access to the rivet tool for the upper pivot, it's much
easier to set the rivet with the entire window frame off the bus.  

The manual shows the repair using a strip of rubber like we're all
accustomed to today, but look at an original seal and I really wonder if
they had a molded part.
