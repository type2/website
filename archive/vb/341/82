I see those "tubes" at swaps just about everytime I go. I run a BN4 in my westy and I love it. it works great. 

www.type2.com has a section on how to redo a BN4 and the Southwind/Stewart Warner manuals are fairly easy to get as well. Most of the heaters I see at swaps are incomplete so it pays to do a little research before you hit the swaps. More often than not people charge a lot of money for them but in my experience a complete BN4 would run under $200, easily.
