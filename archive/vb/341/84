Subject: Beetlemex Engine, Broken Cam...

Thanks, Ronnie, for the info about the differences between Beetlemex and 
Genuine Factory VW.  I did a simple test concerning cam fit in this 
engine which may mean nothing?  I ran a german dished cam in the 
Beetlemex engine's bearing saddles, with the filter oil pump the engine 
came with in place, and there was a notable jump when I turned the cam 
slowly by hand.  I put the original cam, now missing the cam gear, in 
and using a dial indicator, I noted no jump when hooked up to the pump 
gear and turned.  It ran smoothly.  The german cam runs smooth until it 
is mated with the oil pump gear.

To the naked eye, the german dished cam looks like a perfect fit.  The 
end of the oil pump gear seems to properly fit into the slot in the 
cam.  Maybe the "jump" I'm seeing is just a slight run-in issue with the 
way that the pump gear fits into the cam slot?  Lots of high mileage VW 
engines I've torn down show a lot of wear on the end of the pump gear 
and in the slot in the cam.  This jump seems to be more than a break-in 
issue though.

Beetlemex sells an expensive replacement cam.   Part # 0401051015 and it 
cost $ 157.00.  They claim to not have heard of any problems with them!  
Let me hear if anyone has any ideas that could help me with this 
repair.  An interesting note, the degree number stamped twice on the cam 
gear is -8.  Has anyone heard of anything more than -/+ 7?  Gary Gibson
