Subject: Paint removal/Bus renovation

OK volks, I am contemplating getting off of my lazy rear end, and getting to
work on body prep for my 63' walkthrough panel.

My bus has a few areas that need attention, and I am hoping some of you have
been through similar issues and may offer some advice:

This bus was originally a Arizona bus that made it way to the East coast,
where the weather quickly began to degrade the body.  Of particular interest
is my roof.  I was told it was sectioned aft of the cab.  It has layers of
primer & paint covering what has progressed to some bubble rust.  There are
a few places where the rust came all the way through the roof around the
drip rail.  This was only in two spots that I identified two years ago.  I
stripped the area, used some POR15, and patched with Fiberglass.  This bus
is no longer my daily driver, and I want to strip the entire roof/drip rail
section. Was curious if anyone has experience with chemical stripper?  I do
NOT look forward to sanding the entire thing!

The front nose section was hit(or did some hitting).  It is fairly
significant looking, but it didn't hinder my cross country trip here to
Seattle 2 years back.  I have resigned myself that I need a body shop for
this, but would love to do as much of the work as possible, and will
entertain any experience people have had with industrial pullers like this
one:

pe=PRODUCT&RS=1&keyword=puller

A good chunk of change, but if it works it would be a cool tool to add to my
box!

So there is the start.  I also have rocker questions/other body questions to
follow in the future as this project evolves.  Like I said:  Trying to save
money, but looking not to get myself into something that requires
professional experience.

 - Thanks in Advance!
