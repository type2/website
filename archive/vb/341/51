Subject: door window questions

So ... I screwed up my vent windows and got to paint em again ... it is tough
cutting that rubber behind the swoosh.  I expect it wouldn't be so bad with
the small swoosh but my 60 has a big swoosh - damn.

Anyway - it seems to me that there would be no problem putting the door window
frames back into the doors and putting the vent windows in later.  I guess it
might be a bit awkward bolting the spring and stuff on but ... am I right?
Would it be hard or impossible to put the vent window in the frame when the
frame is bolted into the door?

TIA
