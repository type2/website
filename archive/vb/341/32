Derek Gregg in Lancaster, CA. Makes very nice repro hoops & endcaps. He
doesn't do the rubber bumpers, so he may be interested in ordering some.

  The end caps are much harder to make than the rest of the hoops-you have a
compound curve in the caps & they turn out in a heart beat.  Without a huge
VW factory like press/jig, the best way to make them is by treating them
like a blacksmith would-w/ heat & pounding while hot until they are
correctly shaped over a premade jig-good luck.  I have also seen what appear
to be og end caps that are a little crooked along the edges that face each
other when on the hoops.  It appears that the end caps were made as 1 piece
& then cut lengthwise down the middle to make 2 endcaps. You could have the
steel plate rolled to the right radius from side to side in long pieces &
then heat them up to get the 2 different radiuses required for the top of
hoop profile.

FWIW,
