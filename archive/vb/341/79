Subject: Re: [VB] RE:Splitwindow main heat tube

  I have found that stove pipe (you know like for a pot belly stove) is a great replacement. Almost the correct diameter, 
double wall and insulated, galvinized so it won't rust, but not CHEAP, I needed to buy 2 sections and it was aprox. 22 dollars 
per section.
