  Not the Beetlemex engines, the Genuine VW factory replacement engines had a cam problem a few years back. 
These are different then the Beetlemex as they are designed and built as a replacement engine. Beetlemex engines 
are engines built for BEETLES only. There are a few different new engines available from different VW suppliers in 
Mexico, though I believe the factory where Beetlemex engines came from has shut down along with the beetle plant..

   They use a DISHED cam with a hydraulic lifter grind in the Beetlemex hydraulic engines. Most of the aftermarket 
hydraulic cams use a flat cam.
You could probaly call DPR in Santa Ana, Cali and have them custom grind you a hydraulic dished cam out of a good 
dished (German) core or Use a flat hydraulic cam and change the oil pump to a flat cam one, but I do not think that a 
flat cam filter pump will clear the stock exhuast.
