The check valve is on the top piece of the carb. When the float pushes 
upward it causes the valve to close. You should be able to replace this 
valve with a new one from the carb rebuild kits.

I discovered this when I pulled the carb and removed the top.  I filled the 
bowl with gas to check the float level, only to find that gas would just 
stream out and down the throat.
