Well, since he's flying and the airlines *HATE* metal even in baggage
I'd take absolute basics:

6-19mm sockets and 3/8" drive,
6-19 6-point box end wrenches (crowfoot end where available),
#0-2 Phillips and flat screwdrivers,
sparkplug socket,
dwell/tach gauge,
test lamp for timing or, better, a VOM.

Before I left the driveway of the seller I'd:
go to the nearest Wally-world and buy:
   a 2.5 ton hydraulic
   jackstands
   a 5-pound ABC fire extinguisher;
jack up the front end, inspect brakes, wheel bearings, and steering play;
jack up the back end, inspect brakes;
Inspect the metal brake lines for rust;
Check reduction box ends for transmission fluid.

I might replace the brake flex hoses on the principle that there's a 90%
chance they are original.

I would not fly a jack and stands, too expensive and they are <$100US at
Walmart.  Most other tools are available at FLAPS as you travel.

I know Gord and I think he can handle the roadside basics, so I would not
worry too much :-)  Tell him to have fun, stay on I-10/20, and cut up
through Virginia!

OOK!
