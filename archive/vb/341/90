Ronnie,
	The broken cam looks like a normal, 4 rivet, dished camshaft with 
the riveted cam gear.  I have not seen an all one piece VW camshaft 
yet.  I'm curious as to what could have caused the rivets to come loose 
on this cam.  I've not noticed any odd wear on the cam bearings.  The 
cam lobes have a bit less lift than the stock german cam I compared it 
to and the lobes are dressed down on the sides more than old german 
stock.  The broken cam gear is too messed up to tell exactly how it was 
wearing.  Although, all of the teeth are very worn and shiny.  I wonder 
if this amount of wear would occur quickly in its fast and catastrophic 
failure on the road?  Also, the -8 stamp on the cam gear seemed 
different!  Maybe it was a terrible camshaft choice at the factory?  
Thanks, everyone for your help!
   Gary Gibson
