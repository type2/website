Subject: Re: [VB] Beetlemex Engine, Broken Cam...

One of the problems that some of the mexi-motors has had is the cam gear
itself is not machined for a proper fit against the crank gear. The extra
lash wears the the cam gear down and can also cause a slight "knocking"
noise at idle.

Replacing the cam gear (which means the cam too in this case) with one that
meshes correctly is what needs to be done. If you're tearing into the motor
like you are, ditch the filter pump and go full flow. No sense not doing it
while the case is apart. That way you can run a regular aluminum bodied pump
and clear any exhaust you may want to run. The only thing you're looking at
is a pump, some fittings, hose, and a filter adapter if you drill and tap
yourself.

That's what I would do anyway.
