good question! maybe the slot in the cam gear face is a different 
profile, making the tab on the pump gear not seat right...

sadly, no... since each case can be bored at the factory just a 
teensy bit different from side to side, the cam gears came in a range 
of profiles to compensate for the slop or tightness at the cam/crank 
interface. i forget whether the teeth have a different angle on their 
face, or the pitch of the gear (from perpendicular to gear face) is 
what changed - i think the hoover sermons explained it somewhere. 
but it means the variation is cast-in at the gear factory; no way to 
alter it.
