you won't notice any 'jump' w/out the cam gear - the camshaft jumps 
when the lash between cam gear and crank gear is off, and the teeth 
bind.
it is hard enough to find 'regular' cam gears with the right pitch 
(the cam gears are stamped -7 to +7, tho + or -1 is more common and 
usually all you need ... NO stamp means 0), i shudder at the scarcity 
of these; ronnie, looks like it is time for your patented 
part-searching skills!
