I am  gonna swap motors in my busses a 6v into a 12v bus. Can I leave the 6v  
flywheel on?


Hi Ken,
If you leave on the 6 volt FW (6 volt with 200mm clutch area is best for a  
bus or risk having clutch slip too much with 1500 or larger  engine), use a 6 
volt starter, and starter bushing, it will  work.  With a 12 volt starter you 
will end up with damage to both  gears.
