Subject: 6v flywheel with 12v starter Q

You can use it if you use your 6 volt starter. Teeth are different on 12 
volt. 6v starter can run on 12 volts. Otherwise use a 12v flywheel. If you 
change flywheel, you'll need to recheck your endplay. Probably a good idea 
to check it for wear anyway while you've got it out.

Thanks in advance.
