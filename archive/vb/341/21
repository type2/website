Hi Co,
Block the front wheels and jack up the rears.  Release the E-brake,  make 
sure the tranny is in nuetral, and wiggle the tires to see how much slop is  in 
the axles.  Check both sides if one is looser than the other, one or  more of 
the bearings is going bad in there.  Next drain the gear oil out of  the center 
section and RGBs.  Check this oil for metal shavings as big or  bigger than a 
pin head, a few are OK, but if lots then you have bearing trouble  in that 
area.  If all checks out refill the RGBs and then the center  section with 90 
Wt. or 85 - 90Wt. GL-4 gear oil.  Not 140 Wt.!!
