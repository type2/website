shake the empty carb and listen for metallic rattles.
the check valves are little BBs that sit in a   cup in the port 
drillings... they are s'posed to sit snugly when fuel goes the wrong 
way, roll outta the way when fuel goes the right way. sometimes the 
ball gets rusty, sometimes the seat gets corroded, or the whole 
schmeer is stuck in carb goo and in all instances it will let gas go 
the wrong way. you need to pull  the little silver plugs or brass 
wires at the end of the appropriate drillings to really clean em; a 
rusty ball can be replaced - corroded seats CAN be resurfaced, but i 
bet the proper tool is a little obscure! i've seen everything from 
screws to jb weld replugging the drilling port.

i once bought a beautiful NOS 12v 30Pict1 from aircooled.net - a 
check valve was corroded just from sitting and the dang thing leaked 
like a runny nose thru the accel discharge spigot.  john was a prince 
and let me trade it back for an AFM   :)  if i knew what the right 
tool was to resurface em, i have about 3 older PICTS that suffer from 
accel pump check valve seat corrosion - that area is really easy to 
get to.
