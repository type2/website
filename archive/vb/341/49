Subject: RE: [VB] tail light bulb holder

Yeah, I know I need to strap the battery down. I have the original strap, it
doesn't quite fit over my battery. I'm going to try to find some way to
extend the strap-with a threaded rod and connector or something...

I don't necessarily need an OEM piece, I was just wondering about the
quality of the new ones being produced now.

this is just what i'd do--find one in a junkyard or swap meet or e-bay and
replace whole assembly--youre looking for 3 letters  SWF on housing--it all
depends on what youre after--aftermarket or OEM--strap that battery down too
