Subject: Access to fuel sending unit

The sending unit for the fuel gauge on my son's '69 bus stopped working.
After checking fuses, we are trying to determine how to remove the unit.
I am told (and found in the "Library") that we can cut into the tank
from above.  Has anyone done this?  How much room is there before we hit
the tank?  How do we know where to cut?
 
Thanks,
 
Jim
