Subject: RE:Splitwindow main heat tube

Don't know if this will help with regard to the heat tube issue on
splittys. Clara's probably got the best idea. Getting one from a "dead"
bus if possible. Just wanted to pass along replacement heat tubes are
available thru  "The Bus Boys" in Redding, CA. The part number is
210 255 01  Their asking $32.45 for it.
