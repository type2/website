Hi Brooksdj,
If it is a tempered piece of glass and not the Sigla laminated stuff we  
gently work with a slot tip screw driver at the ends of the frame to loosen the  
glass from the seal.  Then work the glass out the reat of the  way by hand.

Do you mean the wing window latch??  If so solid rivets.
