Subject: Westy window rebuild

I have stripped my Westy windows to clean and rebuild them.

The rivets that hold the mechanism in have discoloured the aluminium - I
expect they will again the first time it gets wet.

Has anyone successfully replaced the rivets?  If so what are these type of
rivets called and how did you go about it.

Thanks
Paul
