Subject: Broken Cam on Beetlemex Engine....

I'm helping a friend repair a mexican 1,600 cc with hydraulic lifters 
which has a busted camshaft.  The cam gear came right off the camshaft!  
There is only 18,000 miles on this motor and everything else looked fine 
on teardown inspection.  Ronnie told me that this was an early problem 
with the solid lifter Beetlemex engine but that he had never heard of it 
happening to one with hydraulic valves.

Anyone else have this problem with the hydraulic lifter engine?  Ronnie 
thought that this engine may use a unique cam because of its filter oil 
pump.  I'm wondering if anyone has replaced the cam in one of these 
mexican engines and if so, what cam did you use?  Ronnie suggested I try 
to get one from Beetlemex or at a dealer in Mexico.  TIA  Gary Gibson
