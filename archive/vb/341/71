Subject: Re: [VB] Broken Cam on Beetlemex Engine....

I may not be much help here....

But a friend of mine rebuilt one of these engines and had the same exact 
problem with the cam. AND it was a unique cam as I recall. Reason I know is 
he had one of his employees doing the work and he put the wrong cam in 
there on rebuild.....wasn't good.....
