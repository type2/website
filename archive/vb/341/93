Well, as usual I was doing some work on my bus, and I found that the rear
passenger side taillight had been hit by my battery sliding around, and the
bulb holder is bent(as well as rusty).

I think I should replace the holder-are these all repro'ed by the same
manuf.; or should I only buy this from one source?

Any recommendations?

thanks

use a battery strap, or some bits of 2x4 to keep the battery from bashing the 
tillight bulb holder.  I think original bulb holders are better than repros.
