Subject: John Brown's Buses... The pics & trip report

Hi Volks,

The pics are here: http://www.busesofthecorn.com/JBB2004web/

JBB 2004 was an awesome weekend. We got home late on Sunday...No, truth 
be told it was actually Monday AM when we got through the door. The 
house was a wreck from the last-minute search for the kids birth 
certificates on Friday night, and the furnace was off and would not 
re-light. We finally got the pilot light sensor fixed today and things 
are warming up again.

Jamie put on a great event. The weather was "interesting"... but if you 
didn't like it all you had to do was wait an hour. The best part was 
the people... I got to meet Gerald Livingston, the well-traveled 
Buskatier from Texas; and to catch up with Ian Janes and NcBus Chris 
and lots of our other bus-friends.

The bus ran well, but with a full load on it was a bit of a struggle on 
the hills, dropping the speed to 40MPH a couple of times in 3rd gear on 
I-68. But that's why they put the third lane there, right? I just kept 
a close eye on the CHT and everything was fine.

So my bus-camping season for 2004 is now officially closed... with a 
long list of great events this year.

True Canadian Winter Bus Campout
EveryBus
BusFusion
Blenders By The Falls
European Interest Car Show
Buses Of The Corn
Dixie Bus Gathering
Campin at Da Caves
The Bug Pack Fall Tour
John Brown's Buses

I guess that'll do for now...  Only 123 days left until the 2005 True 
Canadian Winter Bus Campout.


Happy trails,
