Thanks everybody...

a bunch of you wrote in to say that PVC is not the way to go. It could give
off fumes and possibly melt when the hot air is passed through it.
I have a friend of mine who is in the HVAC business and I'm sure if I ask him
he'll come up with a piece of duct pipe that will work. I just didn't think of
it before.
That's why this list is so cool, lot's of brains and experience and people
willing to help.

Thanks again
John
