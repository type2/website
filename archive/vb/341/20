Subject: Tilts for trucks

I just finished bending the U channel stock into into a set of tilt hoops
today for the SC, damn talk about a job getting the bends right without
flaring out the sidewalls on the stock when turning the end corners . Anyway
I was successful and now need to figure out how to make the caps that go
over the wood. Anyone have any ideas on how to make these? additionally I
have a rubber molding shop that is going to be pricing me the stoppers as
well , though I have to buy 100 of them (50 sets) in order for him to make
the mold. I gave him a picture of one but he asked if I could find and bring
him an original so he could measure the radiuses and all before making a
mold. Does anyone have a stopper they would be willing to lend for this?
I'll be making 48 sets of them for sale once I am done.
