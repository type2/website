Autozone and O'reillys have their parts looker-uppers on the Web now.
Autozone says their "CST" brand number 5091 or 5763 will fit a '66.

If they don't sell rubber gas cap "leashes" like on the new cars, you
might try tying a cotton string around the cap and around the filler
neck to help you hang onto it.
