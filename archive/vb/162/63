Subject: re:american tent poles

i have an ez-camper, and most of the original tent poles. they are not
electrical conduit-although they are very similar. they seem to be a little
heavier weight, adn smoother. although this could very well have been
conduit 30+ years ago, it is not exactly the same as conduit today.
