Subject: re:sundial upholstery

i dont have a sundial-but i do have an ez-camper. these are very similar in
design, although i have not seen a sundial upclose to verify the
similarities in construction.

anyway-my front seats remained teh salt and pepper/grey, and the rear of the
bus has this funky orange upholstery with flowers embroidered in it.

hope that helps at least a little bit.

ps. if anyone out there has any leads on this upholstery it would be
appreciated-my rear most cushion(above the engine compartment)is torn due to
sun damage.

thanks
