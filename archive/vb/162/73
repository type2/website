depends on year. 10x1 for early, 6x1 for later, maybe even 
some 8x1's. best thing to do is take some out and compare them at the store. 
also depends on which grease fittings you are talking about. there are various 
sizes on all beams depending on location (torsion bar tubes, center pin, 
spindles....) but yes, they are METRIC....this ain't no american 
car.

VWs are METRIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I found metric grease nipples 
at my

local NAPA store.

 

 

    

anyeone tell me the size of a grease nipple for front beam.

 

I need new one cause the thread is worn out.

so bought 1/8PT but it was big a little.
