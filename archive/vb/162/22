Subject: steering box

well since i am doing this work on the front end...maybe i should change the
steering box lube/fluid/oil what ever you call it.

i can see where the filler hole is(very small) but how do you drain it? do
you need to remove the bottom plate? will this screw with the adjustment of
the steering?
