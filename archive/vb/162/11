Subject: Re: [VB] Head repair question...

With all that damage, I would just buy new heads. It would probably be cost effective compared with
machine shop costs to repair the ones you have now.

I have a head that was ran loose and subsequently, it burned a hole in the piston.  The lower nuts
were loose (the ones inside the valve cover or bottom ones.  Looking at the inside of the head on
the "bottom", there is a 2" or so neat "burned" groove into the head that follows just inside of the
circumferance of the cylinder mating surface about a 1/16" deep.  However, the piston cylinder
mating surface is good.  My question, can the machine shop successfully tig? weld this groove to
fill then machine it back flat?  There are no cracks that I see.
