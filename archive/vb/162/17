I did this very recently.  http://www.type2.com/splittyreflect/msg40229.html

I would call it more of a U-shape if it's the same part I'm thinking of -
number 74 at http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part/367.png .
The ends of the rod should point towards the driver's side and the rod
itself should be towards the passenger side.

I'm pretty sure you can just replace the boot.  It doesn't hold brake
fluid - you don't have to bleed it after you replace it.  I think it
is mostly there to keep junk off the piston rod so it doesn't beat up
the seal where the piston rod goes into the master cylinder.  When I
bought a replacement master cylinder it came with the boot loose in
the box.  Try West Coast Metric.

Good luck!
