>>A while back, last winter or early spring, I "ran" into a nice site that
spelled out how to install front door seals per the original diagonal cuts
and trims.  Man, I hit the print button quick smart.  Now I can't find the

for it.

It included overall "big picture" graphics and a couple of closeups for the
angle trims etc.

Where, where, where?
