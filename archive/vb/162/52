Subject: New shop truck

sorry if this post twice;


  Here are some pics of the new shop truck I just bought today for 300
dollars, runs and drives great, gotta loose the camper shell though. See it
and/or use it at BBB VII, 2003. I am going to fix it up as a
utility/shuttle truck for BBB VII, 2003
