Subject: Re: [VB] Head repair question...

why not get some new heads?  Last time I checked dp were 105 ea and sp were 
125 ea.   may well be cheaper to get new than rebuild.

 I have a head that was ran loose and subsequently, it burned a hole in the 
piston.  The lower nuts were loose (the ones inside the valve cover or bottom 
ones.  Looking at the inside of the head on the "bottom", there is a 2" or so 
neat "burned" groove into the head that follows just inside of the 
circumferance of the cylinder mating surface about a 1/16" deep.  However, 
the piston cylinder mating surface is good.  My question, can the machine 
shop successfully tig? weld this groove to fill then machine it back flat?  
There are no cracks that I see.
