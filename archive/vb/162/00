Subject: Re: [VB] drill bits for metal????

The best bits I've found for the money are titanium. No bit last forever but, these will drill 20 to
30 holes without showing signs of wear.

Can someone reccommend some metal drill bits that will last and be
able to be used for more than one project without breaking or going
dull??
