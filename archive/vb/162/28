Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Westfalia Interior lights

look in the engine compartment, at the left there should be a black wiring 
coming from the from - from the left camper wall.  Follow that down to where 
it connects.  It should have an inline fuse and the other side of the fuse be 
plugged into the voltage regulator (or another place which is hot all the 
time.  Not the coil, which only gets voltage with ignition on.  So clean up 
the connections.   The lights weren't working on my 65 westy when I got it.  
Turned out the wire wasn't plugged in to anything.


I had to find the plastic lenses too, the rectangular ones. The biggish ones 
that cover over the bulb holders.  But I found different kinds- Some had the 
two holes at the bottom, where it screws to the dogleg  of curtain rail 
material.   Some had a groove on the sides, like it slid into a holder,  and 
some had BOTH the two holes AND the groove so I guess they were made later to 
fit either kind.

Tonight when I pulled in the driveway, the light nearest the driver's seat
was on....I haven't been in the bus in three days, and noone else has been
in it either. I wonder what's up?
