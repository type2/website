Howdy VOLKS!

Regarding the picture seen here: =

A little searching on the internet and one come up with...

Action Concept - a German filming and stunt production company based in =
Cologne.  They filmed a movie called 'Alarm Fur Cobra 11' which it looks =
like there are several fans or fan sites.  =
http://www.alarmfuercobra11-fanclub.de/

Here is Action Concept's site.  German and English versions available  - =
cool demo movies.=20
http://www.actionconcept.com/

Here is the movie website.  Anyone read German?  (silly question on this =
list)

Perhaps someone can get the movie and take a screen capture of the bus =
before it was blown up.  Less depressing - at least for me.

Have a bus-tacular weekend.
