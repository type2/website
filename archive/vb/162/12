Subject: RE: [VB] Head repair question...

First off, I'm hoping with your description of steel shims at the top of the
barrel between it and the head you are talking 40hp and not using the proper
copper seal. If you have a 15/1600 and are shimming at the top of the
barrel, that's wrong. Shim at the bottom of the barrel next to the block. I
hand lap my barrels into it's position at the head for a good fit there, but
never use anything between the barrel and head. That gives me the picture of
the Lost in Space robot waving its arms and yelling "Danger, Will Robinson,
Danger". That's the first place I would expect a compression leak.

Subject: [VB] Head repair question...


I have a head that was ran loose and subsequently, it burned a hole in the
piston.  The lower nuts were loose (the ones inside the valve cover or
bottom ones.  Looking at the inside of the head on the "bottom", there is a
2" or so neat "burned" groove into the head that follows just inside of the
circumferance of the cylinder mating surface about a 1/16" deep.  However,
the piston cylinder mating surface is good.  My question, can the machine
shop successfully tig? weld this groove to fill then machine it back flat?
There are no cracks that I see.  

Also, the other head had used steel shims or gaskets between the head and
the cylinder.  The gasket was not positioned on center or looks to had
warped in.  Now there is an uneven mating surface there dug into the
aluminum for when I put it back together with a "new" shim and I am afraid
this side will now leak. It was OK before with sealing, no problems this
side even tho the shim warped.  Question:  Can I have the machine shop
machine this surface back flat?  The contact surface is a little higher
where the cylinder sits from the inside of the head so there is a little
room there but I imagine they would machine it even with the head surface.
Do I need this lip?  Would this be OK?  I guess I can have both heads
machined flat here so the head cc would match.  I noticed in the manual it
said head gaskets not required, but this one side used them and the other
side with the burned groove did not.  Do I need gaskets or shims on the head
side?  I do know (I think) that you shim the cylinder barrel on the case
side to change the head cc.

Thanks!  Gerald
