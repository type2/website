Subject: Re: [VB] Here the h*ll is it / door rubber

the rubber profile in my picture is correct until you get into the 60s. I
have been told VW changed the profile of that upper piece you spoke of,
around 63 and then again in 67. Would like pics of yours to add if you can
manage it. And yes, the repros got lazy but will change soon.
More info added as I find it
