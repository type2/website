The difficulty with that approach is that a loose cap will flail the side
of the vehicle before you can get stopped.  Which is worse?  Hard to say!

I tend to put the cap in the filler "bay" just under the fill spout.  It
chatches drips and you can't close the door without replacing the cap.
Late bay folks, well at least you can't nail the filler door with your
sliding door!
