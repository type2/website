Subject: Re: [VB] Experience with center mounted fan shroud

There is a reason the fan is 'offcenter' like it is.
Looking at the motor from the back, the fan is spinning clockwise.  This
means the air that comes off the right side, is thrown downward, but the air
that comes off the left side, is thrown off in the opposite direction, so it
needs the extra room so that the air can be diverted back in the downward
direction like it needs to be.

A center mount fan, will make the 3/4 side run hotter due to this.  They are
a bad idea if good engine life is a concern of yours.
