Subject: RE: [VB] hole in heater tube

Kevin, I've had good luck before with cleaning the area thoroughly and then
applying a piece of aluminum duct tape. Later I brazed a small piece of
coffee can over the hole for winter.

Subject: [VB] hole in heater tube


one more thing I noticed today. the heater tube under the front floor pan,
or actually right where it kind of turns up to go into the front
compartment, on one side there is a hole. it looks kind of like someone took
a really sharp pipe and hit the wall of the heater tube, because the "round
hole" does not go all the way through, it only pierced the tube on one side
of the circle...that probably sounds little confusing let me try again.

imagine you were making cookies, and when you went to cut the cookies out
your cutter was sharper on side then the other, and when you went to cut a
cookie out-only half the cutter actually cut through the dough-the other
half just left a mark. that is basically what my heater tube looks like-

now my question-is it supposed to look like this. I was thinking maybe this
allowed some pressure equalizing in the tube, to make it easier to blow hot
air in my cabin?
