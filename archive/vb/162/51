Subject: Tool list? VWxxx?

Does anyone have a manual on the web or just a short descriptive list of
VWxxx tools of around the decade of our buses?
I just cleaned out an an entire dealer stock of a HUGE lot of aircooled
tools (finally got that VW 202,d,k :) ). I need to sort out what some of
these were for, hours with Bentley is helping, but some are T1, T3, t4.
TIA<
