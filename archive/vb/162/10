Your Bus is happy to see you.

I don't have direct Westy experience but I am told that their "extra"
interior lights are fed from an inline fuse that is connected to the
battery, starter, or voltage regulator.  You might find that fuse
first and see if it's in good order.  If it's OK try a test light at
the wires at the Westy lamps.  If no light you have broken wires; if
it's good there is something wrong with your fixtures.  Check the
bulb clips for corrosion and make sure the mounting screws are fest
geschraubt.
