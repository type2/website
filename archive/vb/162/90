Subject: Re: [VB] Sundial upholstery

They were left stock, if they do match they were re-done.  The crack heads 
here want 350 for the front seats and around 500 for the rear, but they said 
they would have to look at them out of the bus to be sure, it could be more. 
  So has anyone reupholstered their camper cushions themselves?  I wish I 
could just drive to TJ to get them done.
