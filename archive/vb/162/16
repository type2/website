I have had reasonable luck with the Black and Decker-branded sets.
Unless you need a really huge size it's a lot cheaper to buy the
sets.  For drilling a big hole, doing a pilot hole first seems to
help.

The other tips are to lube the bit and to go slow.  There are all kinds
of specialty cutting fluids and fancy ways to get them on the work but
dipping the bit in plain old motor oil works pretty well for home projects.
If you have a choice, use a lighter weight oil.  Get a tall, skinny
container like a pill bottle or salt shaker and just dip the bit in the
oil.  It's messy but will make the bit last longer.

If you don't have a variable-speed drill, consider getting one.  If
you're using a drill press, move the belt to a lower-speed pulley set.
Steady pressure at low RPMs seems to be kinder to drill bits - there
is more time for the heat to dissipate.

My 1942 copy of "Shop Theory" from the Henry Ford Trade School suggests
a 50 to 70 feet/min speed for steel.  For a 1/4" drill bit this is a
speed of about 750-1050 rpm; for 1/2" it's 350-550 rpm; for 1" it's
200-250 rpm.  The Makita 3/8" variable speed drill I use for most
work is rated 2100 rpm at full boogie, so to drill steel I should run
it at half speed or less.

Good luck!
