It's a temp sign, easily moveable


I am getting a giant VW lolipop (7 foot round) that is mounted on a trailer
and rotates. A friend of mine owns it and is going to sell it to me. He had
it at the VW show at VW headquarters and they tried to take it from him and
then cover it up. After he refused they made him leave the property with it
so he parked out in the street. He has it on the trailer next to his shop
now. If you have a original sigh they can't stop you from displying it, as
long as you don't use it to show as a business. I will mount it on the back
of my new pick up and drive around with it. Wait till people see me towing
it across country.

How do you get away with that big VW logo on your window? No VW lawyers in
Lake Havasu?
