Subject: Sundial upholstery

Hello list,
Does anyone know if Sundial Campers came with ALL of the upholstery
matching, as opposed to the front seats remaining like they came from the
factory, (probably Grey & White), and the rest of the upholstery, such as
the jump seat, rear folding seat, rear cushion behind the folding seat, etc,
being being done in color-coordinated vinyl, (green, black, red, yellow,
etc)with white piping.  In other words, did Sundial re-upholster the front
seats to match the rest of the seats they installed at the Sundial factory?

Thank you,
Ed
