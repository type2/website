If you put "N Cornelia Ave & W Normal Ave, Fresno, CA 93722" in www.maps.google.com you'll find one of the largest collections of ACVW's in Fresno. It's the third lot north east of the Cornelia & Normal intersection, Dennis Sullivan's place. He isn't on the list, but you might have seen his chopped black split bug at shows in this area.
