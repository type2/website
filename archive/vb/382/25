If I remember correctly, the old release bearings (throw-out) had a
fiber pad on them. That would be the surface that presses against the
pressure plate. It may have separated from the bearing face if you have
the old style.

found a broken washer, that appears to be brown, some type of stiff fiber.


The diameter of the washer matches the diameter of the throw out bearing.
