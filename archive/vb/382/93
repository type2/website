  Hey Mark,

I am a guy, however I can see the possiblity of confusion. I've had this bus
since 72 and have driven it well over 200k miles. Love the bus, just not the
noise. I remember driving it from NY to CA in 74 and stuffing kleenex in my
ears. Had a glass pack muffler on it at the time. Going to the quiet pak did
reduce the noise. I regularly use ear plugs when I drive it. Have done it for
years. AS you have seen in my earlier post, there is lots of sound proofing
installed and it did make some difference.

Chris
