Hi all 

I guess I'll jump on this thread

I just ordered this from WW:

http://www.wolfsburgwest.com/cart/DetailsList.cfm?ID=211798001

the web site description states:

ACCELERATOR REPAIR KIT, includes push rod, lever, pin,
springs, washer, and cotter pin

Note it said springs not spring

The tube type return spring is not in stock

Will this work on my round bowl carb?

My petal is always stuck and i push it up with my
toe..

I also ordered this:

http://www.wolfsburgwest.com/cart/DetailsList.cfm?ID=211721619

GAS PEDAL SPRING, fits at the base of the pedal

now if that tube i had lying around here, or was it in
Hawaii?... ever shows up I'll have four springs
working.

boing boing boing boing...

aloha
