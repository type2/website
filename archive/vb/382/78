Hi Uncleric,
We have used distilled white vinegar for that purpose.  It does not  attack 
the fabric like chlorine will and the slightly acidic nature of the  vinegar 
kills the mold.
  We also have thrown down a new tarp and used soap and water to clean  a rat 
infested R/W tent.  Followed by good drying out in the sun on its  poles.
