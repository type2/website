Subject: odd piece found in engine

Hi guys,

 

I was just working on my bus, I pulled the engine-due to an odd noise, that
I thought was the throw out bearing. I can't remember exactly what the noise
was-it appeared when the weather was pretty bitter cold-so I had basically
stopped driving it-waiting for warm weather, so I could pull the engine.
Warm weather is here now, for a few days anyway.

 

Well I pulled the engine, and found a broken washer, that appears to be
brown, some type of stiff fiber. It was broken in two(with one small chip
missing). It was lodged inside the area where the starter gear is. I'm not
sure where it came from. The diameter of the washer matches the diameter of
the throw out bearing.

 

The throw out bearing looks ok.

 

The center circular thing on the clutch pressure plate seems loose. I don't
remember, but I don't think this thing should rattle at all. Am I correct in
thinking this? This assembly is the one with springs that, when the engine
is installed, hits the throw out bearing. I believe it is part #
211-141-025-D.

 

Any suggestions on determining where this broken washer came from, so I know
what I need to replace?

 

Thanks,

 

-Kevin
