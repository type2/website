Subject: Musty smell in side tent.

My side tents have been in the basement this winter and I got them out to
ready for the camping season. They have a musty smell and some surface mold on
them. Anyone know how to get that stuff of?? My daughter's friend works at a
white water outfitter and says they use something called "Stink-out" or
something like that, to soak the life vests in. Any ideas?
