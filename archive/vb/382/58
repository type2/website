A big THANK YOU to Michael and Stephanie for a wonderful weekend.  I
regreted having to leave Saturday, but that is life.  (Dark Star
Orchestra, the country's best Grateful Dead cover band, was playing in
Tucson and so we had no choice!)

Noelle and I really enjoyed meeting all of the friendly folks.  We
regularly attend BBB, Corona and sometimes, Jerome, and it was really
nice to go to a small campout where we really got to talk to people
and get to know them.

Thanks for welcoming us into the best Bus Club in the world!

P.S.  I have some pics and will get them up later.  Gotta run now.
