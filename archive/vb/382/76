<<Musty smell in side tent. 
My side tents have been in the basement this winter and I got them out
to ready for the camping season. They have a musty smell and some
surface mold on them. Anyone know how to get that stuff of??>>

The only thing that will remove mold stains is bleach, and you for sure
don't want to be using bleach on the tent.
 
I had a tent that I bought that was stored in a damp basement.

Wow--did it smell.

The Cure?

I set the tent up on a warm, slightly breezy,sunny day.

Get a bucket of warm water and some        " Dirt Can't Hide From
Intensified Tide" and lightly scub ( medium soft brush mounted on the
end of a pole for the roof ) the tent down with it---
Inside and out.
Rinse well----

Let it dry in the sun.

It'll look and smell like a field of daisies when your done.
Just like a set of sheets hung on a line all day--

Squeaky Clean.
