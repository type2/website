I assume you are referring to the front of the bus. Look at the website

I was looking to replace the accelerator cable connection parts on my 
bus. I saw this on cip1.com, and it looks like what I have. The 
description says it is only for buses 50-62, and I have a '65. Anyone 
know if this will work, and if not, where I can get the parts that will 
work?
