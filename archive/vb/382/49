Subject: April Fools at the Expense of General Motors...

A friend tipped me off to an unintentionally funny website sponsored by General
Motors and Trump's The Apprentice. The two corporate geniuses have teamed up to
make a web site where contestants can create commercials about the new Tahoe. 

Of course some folks have been creating ads not necessarily in-line with
Chevrolet's mission in mind. GM is apparently sleeping at the wheel because the
ads are still up... for now anyway.

Here is my creation:

Here is where you can create your own.
