If you are lucky enough to get some dry weather and sun, that's the  
best ingredient.

On our Westy pop-up I set it up and used a combination of Laundry  
Stain Remover (on the obvious mold spots), Febreeze and about a day's  
worth of sunlight. Make sure everything is dry before you put it away.

I found several mentions of IOSSO on camping sites. I've never used  
it though.

Here are some useful tips:
