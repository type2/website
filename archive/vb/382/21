Subject: accelerator cable connection

Hi guys,

I was looking to replace the accelerator cable connection parts on my bus. I
saw this on cip1.com, and it looks like what I have. The description says it
is only for buses 50-62, and I have a '65. Anyone know if this will work,
and if not, where I can get the parts that will work?

Thanks...al this warm weather forecasted, and I can get some work I've been
wanting to do all winter...
