Good idea for any kind of combustion heat - gas heater, propane heater,
natural gas, whatever.

This would probably work.  I would use a fuse between the battery and
the heater.  Also, the way it sits in the Bus, the fuel tank is at the
same level or a little higher than the heater, so whatever you rig up
for a bench-test fuel tank should sit the same way.  In other words,
don't set the heater on your workbench and expect it to pump fuel up
from a jug on the floor.  It does have a fuel pump but I'm not sure
how much head it is designed to deal with.

If you want to test it out, you could always take off to the great
white north - it's a beauty way to go...
