Looking at the pictures in the Bentley and thinking about the time I was
messing with the clutch on a '74 Bug, if this washer did come off of the
thrust bearing, it will be relatively thin radially.  In other words, if
it's (say) 2.5" outside diameter, it will be something like 2.25" inside
diameter.

On page M-23 2 of the '63-'67 Bentley, it mentions a throwout bearing
with a "plastic ring" that started in September 1964 for the early 1965
models.  The part number the Bentley gives is the same part number
that's in the '67 parts book at the doc project.

On page M-19 1 of the '63-'67 Bentley, there is a cross section of the
clutch, and you can pretty clearly see that there's some kind of washer
between the ball bearing in the throwout bearing and the round thing
that releases the springs on the clutch.  This washer is attached to the
throwout bearing with some kind of metal collar.  In living ASCII, use a
fixed width font:

.___.     .__.
|   |     |  |
|-O-|     |  |
|___| /XX |__|
-----/
--------------

  input shaft

--------------
-----\
+---+ \XX .__.
|   |     |  |
|-O-|     |  |
|___|     |__|


The transmission is to the left.  The boxes with the -O- in them are the
ball bearing in the throwout bearing.  The "XX" is the washer in question,
and the lines running from it to between the ball bearing and the input
shaft are the metal collar that holds the washer to the ball bearing.
The empty boxes on the right are the thing that operates the clutch.

It _looks like_ that if the washer was missing, the only contact between
the throwout bearing and the thing that operates the clutch would be the
edge of the metal collar that holds the washer to the ball bearing.  If
this is what's going on, I think the clutch would still work but you'd
get some metal-on-metal noises when you stepped on it.

Does one side of the washer have concentric marks on it, like the
grooves in a record?  It might tend to get these from spinning against
the thing that operates the clutch.

I _think_ you're correct, but I wouldn't swear to it.

According to the doc project parts list, that's the 180 mm version.
The 200 mm version is 211 141 025 B.  This change happened at the very
end of the 1962 model year.
