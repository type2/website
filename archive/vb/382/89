that  is different is the rear engine lid. He louvered  that. 
Good luck.

hey ronnie  Also tell him that he just blew his head  gasket recently :)   I 
suggest that chris put in a set of ear  plugs.   The subu 2.2 and 2.5 had 
their own set of problems also.  these motors are the reason for the subu head 
gasket in a bottle coming about.  It sounds like something is amiss as there 
isn't normally too much noise in  these splitties unless it is a empty panel bus. 
This coming from a guy who has 5  splitties on the road and has been driving 
tham since 1970. OK  I have  to ask,  Chris are you a girl or a guy, see the 
reason i ask is that girls  senses are a lot better than any guys , they hear 
and smell much better  than we do in more ways than one  :)   Without seeing or 
riding in the  bus I don't want to make too many suggestions other than stay 
away from  conversions.  later   Mark dearing
