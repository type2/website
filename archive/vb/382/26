Actually, what Kevin describes was used on Beetles, Ghias & Buses thru Early
1966.  In late 1966 (about April or so), this contraption was updated to
just the single tube that Rocky describes and the return spring was mounted
on the carburetor and throttle arm.  Kevin - this is the right set up yer
looking for if you're running it pure stock on yer 65 Type 2.
