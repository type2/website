Hi Conrad,
Are you saying you can not get the tank in there at all, or that once it is  
in there you can not get it to sit down into place.
  If the latter we had to dent the very back center of the tank to  clear 
that area.  Which when we did the dent, the bottom of the  tank sprung in.  Had 
to remove the sender and use a wood baseball bat  to push/pop back out the tank 
bottom.
