Subject: Bumper color is it white, or is it "off" white?

I've painted our '65 panel bus, and now I am ready to paint the
bumpers (they are currently primer black...eeech).

Question is: The upper portion of the bus is Pale Blue (which is a
silly name for the color, which really is an off white with a greenish
tint in my color blind eyes, a standard VW color). Was it stock to have
the "white" bumpers the same color as the "top" color (in this case Pale Blue),  or were they an
actual white?

Thanks!

Jon
