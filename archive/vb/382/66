Subject: Re: [VB] 68 gas tank 

The tank got hung up between the cross brace that supports the rear  
shelf and the bellhousing hump. I couldn't get it in far enough to  
pivot the tank in.

I need to pull the engine again - the mechanic that is helping me get  
the bus back together and on the road wanted to get the engine in  
place and running.

BTW, the gas in the original tank was about 15 years old. Man that  
stuff stinks.
