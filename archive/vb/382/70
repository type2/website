Subject: testing voltage regulator

Howdy. I've been going through my parts stash getting stuff together to
take to EveryBus to get rid of, and I found a nice, shiny looking voltage
regulator. However, it was in with some stuff that I know was broken...So,
is there a way to test it without installing it in a vehicle? It's the
1600 upright engine style...I'm assuming it's 12v...
thanks,
