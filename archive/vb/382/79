Hi Chris,
Have you tried an ACVW engine that has been counter balanced and CW  cranked? 
 Plus a FF tranny to get the RPMs down?  Definitely made our  walk thru panel 
camper conversion MUCH quieter.
  Doubt that you can do the Subaru engine to fit without body  cutting.  As 
for the radiator you might try faking up an early AC radiator  look a like on 
the rear of the bus.
  Do not think a radiator in the engine compartment will work, because  at 
higher speeds almost all WC engine rely on the forward motion of the  automobile 
to ram cooling air through the radiator.
  Looking forward to hearing what you find out!!!
