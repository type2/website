Subject: Phoenix area bus parking space?

Hi, I am looking for someone in the PHX area that has the extra room to park a bus while I arrange transport to Texas. Bus does run but does not like to stop. It can be driven around a little but is in no condition for a long haul. I wont need to move it from its present location for a couple of weeks. In the meantime I am mulling over ideas on the long haul transport. I may need up to a month or so to have it parked. If you have extra space in your backyard and would not mind looking at a 67 bus once in a while please privately email me and we can talk. Also if anyone has any decent leads on cheap auto transport between the PHX-DFW areas let me know. Thanks. kenlinoski(-at-)yahoo.com .
