Subject: Splitty near Gold line in LA

I was in Los Angeles on Sunday and rode the Metro light rail from Pasadena to downtown LA. 

Spotted a splitty in a storage yard. It looked rough, graffiti, etc. 

Has anyone else seen it? I found the triangle shaped yard on Google Maps. Here's the link...

or enter "337 West Avenue 26, Los Angeles, CA" in www.maps.google.com and look for the yard between the Metro rail tracks and the Pasadena freeway, northeast of that address. The cross streets are W. Ave. 34 and Lacy Street. 

There is a flying saucer shaped something near it. In the satellite photo the bus is the 13 vehicle from the sharp point near the freeway counting to the left.
