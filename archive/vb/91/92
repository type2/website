Hey all,

I don't normally publicize our meetings on the list, but this is our =
last meeting before Bring Your Own Bus '02 on April 6th, so we have lots =
of news to disseminate to the masses and we would still love lots of =
input from people about what they'd like to see.  Our meeting starts at =
8pm here in San Jose...there's an address and maps at our website, =
http://www.redshift.com/~taylorvw/svt/svtmeet.html

Hope to see a few new bodies out there tonight!
-Taylor
