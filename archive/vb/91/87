i've thought of that - sprayed starter fluid at both head/manifold
junctions, at the base of the carb, the throttle shaft, the heat
riser/manifold junction, etcetc.

rpms never go up, so i ASSUME i don't have a leak - but i'm still looking.

i am mean i am BAFFLED - i have checked every bit of every flowchart you
can think of.

its gonna be sumpin dumb... like my oil cleaner has evil elves in it :)
