Hi Chris,
Now perhaps, but those who where of driving age back in the 1950-70s the 
average hieght was lower.  Did anyone find a source of those lead sled 
traffic light viewers?  Since they have the same problem with viewing traffic 
lights due to lowered roofs it should work for tall volks in the buses.  For 
Eric at just a tad under 6' he has to lean forward in some instances for 
viewing the traffic lights, but otherwise sits back to be comfortable and not 
stress his back.  Really though it is not the total hieght of the driver but 
the demension between thier seat and eyes that makes or breaks how much one 
can see forward and upward out of the windshield.  
  We did shorten a driver walk thru seat bottom for a tall friend by cutting 
each spring down by one coil and reattaching everthing.  It definitely helped 
him!
