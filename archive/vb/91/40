A good idea.  I checked the voltate at my headlights and found it to be
12.5V with the engine running, meaning that I am losing 0.9V in the wires.
This is a reasonable drop.  I've been meaning to check the current in the
warning light wire, as I think that it gets higher as the current demand
goes up.  This would lead to the light glowing.
