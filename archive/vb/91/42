Hello all,

I am hoping to find some good information that will help me along the way to 
getting my '62 bus running well. I live near Lake Washington in the Seattle 
area and I am looking for local spots, (Even in Oregon), of good Vintage VW 
Repair Shops, Restoration shops, Parts Resources and Wrecking yards that you 
would highly recomend.

Thanks again,
Joshua
