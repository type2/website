I put a volt meter on it tonight and it stays at around 14v in idle. It
goes up some when I rev it up but not a lot. Should it be putting out
14v at idle? Wont that cause the batt to overcharge?

Measure the voltage at the battery terminals with the engine at over
2500
RPM.  It should be between 12.5 and 14V.
