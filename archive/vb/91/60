Subject: 67 M/C Piston Clearance

Hi all,

I'm trying to rebuild a '67 master cylinder with a FAG kit from Bill & 
Steve's.  How tight should the piston surfaces be in the cylinder.  I 
read through the archives and read about cleaning the cylinder with a 
bore, but nothing on the tolerance between cylinder bore and piston 
diameter.  The back cylinder seems to have a tighter fit than the front.

BTW I'm putting in my '65 since I blew a rear cylinder, loosing my 
brakes at a scenic pullout, just before I would have been going down 
"the Pali" a very steep grade road over the mountains on Oahu in Hawaii. 
 Time for a dual circuit system.....glad to be alive....

Chris
