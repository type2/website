Hi Steve,
If memory serves us the tool kit was $30.00 and came with some of the 
standard longer length inserts.  We bought a whole bunch of the special order 
even longer (30mm) which cost us some more, but well worth it.  To install 
Heli-Coils you have to buy a simular special tool kit anyway!  Eric&Barb
