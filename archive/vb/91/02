gee! thanks for all the replies! haven't seen that 
many on a topic for a while.

i didn't want to come off as a "he-man" because my 
bus is my only car, i was just curious as to how many of us actually drive them 
regularly, rather than just on sunny days. 

i was also a little depressed about the whole "bus 
sightings" topics, like it was some kind of miracle that a bus would actually be 
on the road and not tucked away in a sealed, weather proof vacuum chamber. yes, 
i know the "bus sightings" were more out of excitment, but if i did that every 
time i saw a bus, i'd never be able to stop typing.

well, keep drivin' them and enjoying them. and for 
all those who avoid the bad weather, summer is coming!

later,

jon
