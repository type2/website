Hey all,

Well, I'm getting married (believe it or not) on the 20th of July this 
year.  Amber and I have decided that we want a nice deluxe to be our 
getaway car.  We're in San Jose and the wedding (in the afternoon) is in 
Los Altos.  This is an open call to anyone in the area who's willing to let 
us use or who's willing to be our driver (it'll be short, we promise) on 
that special day.  We're looking for a 23 or 21 Window...any year is 
fine.  Stock height preferred.  Ideally, we'd love to find a green/white 
bus since that's the color of the church, but we're very open to 
alternatives.  If you're willing or know someone who might be, please shoot 
me an email.

Thanks,
-Taylor
