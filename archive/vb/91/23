Not looking for flames but...

I bought one of those kits and was not pleased.  The fan was extremely 
noisey, although it worked okay, and the switch was lousy since it became 
very hot during operation.  This was installed by the book.  I deinstalled 
it and put it away.  Perhaps the boat fan would work better but I haven't 
seen them so I couldn't say.
