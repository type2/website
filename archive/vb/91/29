One thing this "poll" has shown me is how many darn crew cabs are out 
there! I didn't realize there were so many list members with crew-cab 
trucks...and they drive 'em!!!

Remember the old days when we used to get the weekly statz from Joel Walker?

I've got a big 'ol suburban as well...use it for towin' VW's 
though...so I don't sell it.
