Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

I mostly drive my '66 Westi as a daily driver.

Other times I use my '71 Ch*vy C-10 for parts hauling and general utility
use.  Or when it rains and general bad weather to save the VW from the
nastys.

Fridays I usually splurge and take the 911...  Well my cold start valve is
broken so it has not moved for the last few months due to other work on a
'74 Westi.  Now that the '74 is gone I am working to get the '66 brake
upgrade completed... One of these days the 911 will be a terror on the
highway again :(

My belief is that if it is not wet/snow/salty out then the bus can be a DD.
