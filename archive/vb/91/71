Several of the books, including the current VW interchange manual state that
there is an air stall at certain RPM's above factory maximum, (I have no
idea what that rpm is) because the air volume cannot pass by the cylinders
quick enough. There was also mention of the sheet metal fans flying apart at
hi rpm.

Do we really run lower RPMs?  Perhaps our peak RPMs might be less than the
racerboys, but our average running RPMs are higher.

I'm also skeptical of whether a faster fan would move more air through the
limited space of the finning and oil cooler

If I was experimenting with this, I'd run a welded and balanced fan with
this setup, as well as an alternator (less rotating mass than the generator)
