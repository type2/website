I have a mexican engine in my '71, and another in my '69 bug.  Other than
changing one stud for the
dual port manifold and drilling and tapping a hole for the thermostat they
are a direct replacement.  Two years with only oil changes and valve
adjustments.  No oil leaks yet!  I'm happy with them.  Ronnie at Old Volks
sells them at a fair price.
