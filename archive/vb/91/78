Subject: Looking for 67 master cylinder spring plate

Boy this seems like a longshot.  I'm rebuilding a 67 master cylinder to 
put in my 65.  the m/c i got from the donor bus has one good spring 
plate, and the other has two tabs broken off.  any junked ones out there 
with a good spring plate?  Or any ideas on how or if i should try to 
make one.
