Do we really run lower RPMs?  Perhaps our peak RPMs might be less than the
racerboys, but our average running RPMs are higher.

I'm also skeptical of whether a faster fan would move more air through the
limited space of the finning and oil cooler

If I was experimenting with this, I'd run a welded and balanced fan with
this setup, as well as an alternator (less rotating mass than the generator)
