Subject: [VB] Is it siezed?!?!?!

I inherited a 1904 engine that was built for my bus.  When I bought the bus
the engine had just been installed and never started.  When I got it home I
installed a fuel pump, put in a new battery, set the timing to 8 degrees and
after a few tries and coaxing it started and ran for a minute or so pretty
roughly.  So I set the timing to 12 degrees, it started and ran just as
roughly.  I killed it, put the hold down strap on the battery and after a
while went to start it again...nothing. I could hear it trying, like there
wasn't enough juice to turn it over but I but in a brand new battry with
around 600cca.  So I tried to turn the engine over by hand at the pulley,
but without a breaker bar couldn't get enough muscle behind it to turn it.
It doesn't feel like its mechanical.  It feels a little squishy like I need
more leverage to turn it.  Any ideas on what's happening?  Could it just
have so much compression that it won't turn over.  Ideas?!?!?!
