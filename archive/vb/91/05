Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

Back in the late '70s used to drive my '71 bay all over LA and Orange
county's. In fact used to commute from Huntington Bch to my job in Long Bch.
Friends used to recognize my van from the oil filter visible at the rear.
Used to drive it all day thru the deserts of SoCal and Nevada. Probably why
it pucked it's guts out south of Bakersfield. Made for a long tow back over
the grapevine. Different time, 55mph speed limit and a built motor meant I
passed a lot of cars. Now older,wiser(somewhat) and four buses in the yard
and not one runs!And here we are on the island with great secondary and
gravel roads, not to mention the infamously slow driving canucks ; ) Soon, I
tell myself.
