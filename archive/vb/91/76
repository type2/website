I'd hope so.  The aircooled VW has a very prominent place in Mexico as
low cost transportation, and I doubt that the Mexican government would
let it go so easily.  The New Beetle will not fill the same role in the
typical use a VW bug receives in Mexico.  The NB is just too fragile and
the price is well over twice as high.
