There is a west coast supplier that puts one of the ATEs on eB*y from
time to time.  The last one I noticed sold 2 weeks ago for $150.

As for rebuilt MCs, FWIW some have opined in the past that a rebuilt MC
can lose some of its stopping power and/or safety once the barrel is
honed, and should be avoided if possible.  But I imagine that lots have
done it without a problem, as well.
