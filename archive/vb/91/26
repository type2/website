Hi List,
Yes, I drive my 63 crew cab everyday to work, play, or
where ever I wanna go. Rain, shine, sleet, heat, snow,
doesn't matter to me or Buck (crew's name). You can
spot me on any given day in Eastern Oklahoma driven my
splittie grinnin' from ear to ear!! I can't imagine
how I lived 43 years without a splittie. I sold a
maxed-out 4x4 Che*y Suburban to buy my crew cab. Best
damn thing I ever did!!

See ya, 

Pete
Buck - 63 Crew cab
