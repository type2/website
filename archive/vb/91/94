Subject: RE: [VB] Voltage regulator...

That's for sure about voltage regulators. I had a 71 westfailure years ago
and the charging system didn't seem right, so I thought I'd pull the
regulator apart and see if I had burnt contacts. When I pulled it out of the
van and looked at it, it looked like someone had been in there before me. I
pulled up the tabs on the can an pulled it off and sure enough, someone had
built a homemade electronic voltage regulator and wired it in. After tracing
the circuit I found the two pots that would set hi and low voltage and
played with it on the bench untill it looked right and put it back on the
van. Worked great up to the time I sold the van. But you can never tell what
someone else has put in your vehicle, that's for sure!

That seems a bit high at idle.  Normally, you don't want to see over 14.2V
at any speed.  sounds like you might have some stuck contacts in the
regulator.  Swap it out for a new one.  Make sure that the new one matches
the generator (38A generators take a different regulator than the 30A
generators, and you can't predict which one you'll find in a bus these
days.
