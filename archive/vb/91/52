Subject: Re: [VB] Oversized crank pulley ?'s

Has anyone here run the oversized crank pully (20% larger) that some vendors
offer?  I'm thinking of trying one out on my bus, but want to know if anyone
has tried one already to see what your results were.

I figure, withour lower rpms, we dont have to worry about the fan coming
apart from the extra rpms, and the extra cooling couldn't hurt anyway when
we start hitting over 100 degree temps.  (run a stock pulley in winter
months)
thanks for any input.
