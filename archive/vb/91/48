Subject: Re: [VB] Tires Again??



I am running Yokohama Supervan 8 ply sidewall 185r14  I think that they are 
rated at 2500 lbs.  Sears can get them for you plus they have the adapter to 
balance wide fives.  Try to go there when the old guys come in and work 
part-time on the weekends because no one else knows how to use the adapter.
I really like the tires, they are expensive,  but there are not many tires 
that are both the right size and have such a high load rating.

good luck
