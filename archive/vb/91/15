Subject: Re: [VB] re-engine,etc.

I just installed a 'mexi motor' in my 64 bus last month.
My last bus (66 westy) ran one a couple years ago too. I went with the solid
lifters on this motor, because it seemed the hydraulic lifters (in my 66
bus) would loose thier prime if my bus sat for more than a day or two, and
would take a few minutes to prime the lifters again. Kind of annoying.
