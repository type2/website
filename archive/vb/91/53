Could anyone out there give me any tips on testing a voltage regulator?
I think mine is overcharging my battery but Im not sure how to test it.
It a 1600cc with a GEN. The reason Im suspicious is the mystery water
under the battery after the bus is on for a while. It was a LOT of
liquid but the battery isn't low on water. I figured I would ask the all
knowing list if there was a quick check to be done for the regulator.
Also, is the general consensus of the list that a 6V gas gauge will work
in a 12V system?
Thanks as always!
TJ
