Subject: Ohio VW Bus event

Hey All,
Since it's Friday and all, I just wanted to remind all the midwestern listees (and others) about the Second Annual VW Buses 'n Boats bash May 17-19 just north of Cincinnati, Ohio.  There will be an 8 mile canoe trip, LIVE music in the campground Saturday evening, and of course the Famous Full Moon Bus Club Breakfast Burritos.  Check out the event web page at  http://www.geocities.com/buses_n_boats
for all the info or pmail me.  Are you looking for a way to Boycott VWoA's actions??  Then blow off their vintage show this weekend and come to ours!



Peace, John Baker
