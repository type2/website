It should follow the same path as the rear blinkers, engine wiring, etc.
and be inside the passenger-side frame rail...

Subject: [VB] Gas guage wire


I tore the cargo floors cut out of my '65 crew cab and I'm about to weld
in
the replacements. I have a small problem though. I can't find the wire
coming from my gas guage. Also, I don't know where the wire enters the
body,
the route it takes to the sender unit in the tank and where it clips to
the
body once inside the compartment where the tank sits.

Can anyone help be out?
