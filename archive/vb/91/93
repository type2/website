That seems a bit high at idle.  Normally, you don't want to see over 14.2V
at any speed.  sounds like you might have some stuck contacts in the
regulator.  Swap it out for a new one.  Make sure that the new one matches
the generator (38A generators take a different regulator than the 30A
generators, and you can't predict which one you'll find in a bus these
days.
