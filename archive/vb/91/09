I've tried that, except my speed is closer to 55 and I've had a couple close
calls where I ended up on the shoulder when a truck came up behind me doing
about 75-80mph.  To make things even more fun, I seem to always want to get
off the highway on a left-side exit.  Impossible.  Think I'll just stick to
the backroads.

ps I drive my '66 Westy to work every day even though it's in a sad state of
disrepair.
