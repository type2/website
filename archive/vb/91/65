Subject: Priceless tool  ..  Re: ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????


The only help I could possible offer him would be what I just said, do it 
yourself and not depend on others.  No worries.  Sorry to hear of your bad 
experience with this crowd.  They have been nothing but helpful to me.  
There is no other way I can think of to get quick responses to questions 
that I may have in the restoration of my vert and busses. Almost like a 
priceless tool in my box.  No matter how dumb or important the question may 
be, someone answers up.  Time is short for all of us and anything helps.  As 
for the business end of things, selling or buying, I stick to the 
appropriate tools for that.  Erape, thesamba, swaps.  Not neccessarily in 
that order.
