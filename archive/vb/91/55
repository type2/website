Subject: Re: [VB] Oversized crank pulley ?'s

We use a smaller generator pulley (6v type 3 ?? just have to find the right
offset) and then we get 2.2 to 1 generator to crank speed (1.6 to 1 stock) and
it has been better but we drive 3200 rpm max. After getting hot (and it still
does some) it does cool down much faster at the side of the road.
