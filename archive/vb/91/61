Subject: 67 M/C Piston Clearance Continued

To briefly continue my post regarding rebuilding the 67 master cylinder, 
I'm interested in the clearance spec between the cylinder and that part 
of the piston with the ring of little holes.  Should that part of the 
piston fit snug or can there be some clearance.  The other end of the 
piston with the secondary cups fits pretty tight.

Thanks in advance,

Chris
