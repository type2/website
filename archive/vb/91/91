this is pretty common over on the ol ch*vy truck list... a good way for
stockers or resto geeks to keep the original single circuit brake. keep in
mind that these trucks are s l o w (ours is 52 years old, original babbitt
216, stump puller trans) and a slight reduction in brake power might not
matter.

the clowns who rod out to v8 350+ and KEEP a s/c brake are nuts.

i have a nos m/c for the 65, but i plan on converting to a dual circuit asap.
