Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

Hi everyone,
Up to about a month ago I was driving my 63 15-window everyday to 
work/store/shopping, etc....

Now due to work issues I actually had to drive a company car. It's a D*dge, 
not an air-cooled VW.

But, at least I drove my bus almost everyday for at least 4+ years.

Hope that counts for something.
