we've lost some really knowledgeable folks off here
because of the whiners and moaners .
----------------------------------
As you might know:
 It comes & it go's.

There are many folks that contribute to this community
that don't whine or moan! We know who they are. "UJ"
That group from Havasu.
 Not to mention all those who arrive at the events
from all over the country.
 We can put up with a few whiners & moaners.
