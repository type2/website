"rust spot on passenger front floor"

No offense to sight-impaired individuals with digital cameras.

I have a bus with holes in it. I know what rust through looks like  
left untreated and painted over. Put a wire wheel on that floor and  
there will be plenty of rust spots to contemplate.

Side story. I bought a front pedal pan from some guy on eBay. He said  
the same thing. When I got it, I took a wire wheel to it and ended up  
with holes the size of quarters in at least 10 areas. I mailed him a  
complaint. His reaction was "Well, if I had taken the time you did to  
find out there was rust in the floor, I wouldn't have sold it for  
that price." In other words, he knew he ripped me off and didn't want  
to admit it.

Caveat emptor.
