I have never considered posts that Unca Jerry makes regarding "Aridzona Bus
Sale" as SPAM.  I pass many of these to people in the hobby that don't
(ohmygaw!) have access to the internet - yep there are those die-hard few
out there that "don' need no stinkin' computer" to continue in the VW
hobby.  So I enjoy and do not mind these posts.  FWIW, this is my opinion,
shared by many on both Type 2 and VintageBus and of course the opposite view
is shared by a few rather than a lot.

I've mentioned this before.  Y'all have a DELETE button - use it.  With all
the filtering options available in most email clients today, take a little
time out y'alls apparently busy schedule to make one so y'alls are not
bothered by Unca Jerry.

It's either that or unsubscribe

And John, we all appreciate whatever help you may always provide :-)
