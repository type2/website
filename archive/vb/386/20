Hi,
Don't use naval jelly. I know its cheap and available. It does not stop 
rust. Get some Picklex. Stops rust, prevents creaping, best stuff on the 
market for rust busting and preventing, next to POR15. A small amout really 
does cover a large area.

Good luck!

 1967 bus, but I'd like to take care of some of the spot rust.

 You know: sand, treat with naval jelly, wash, prime, paint.   Just
 the standard to keep the cancer from spreading.
