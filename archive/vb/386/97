Subject: Re: [VB] Anyone know the origin of the "bus bones" logo?

I have one of those that I never stuck on my bus. There's a name on it 
under the 23 window Deluxe in front of the yellow Standard on the right 
hand side. You can see the line in the image you posted. I can't make 
out all the letters on mine, but as best I can tell it's something like, 
TA(letter I can't make out) RAND '93. It's in all caps. I'm not 100% 
sure of the D at the end of the name either, but I think that what it 
is. It's open at the top left, kind of like a crooked U, but that 
doesn't make as much sense as a D.

This was a sticker that was sold in the parking lots at Dead shows.
