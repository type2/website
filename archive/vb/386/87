Subject: Re: [VB] Bosch Distributor Rebuild Kits?

Jim -

As an added service to my website distributor listings, I do sell selected
hard-to-find distributor parts & kits.  This is one of them and my current
price is $14 shipped anywhere in the USA (California peeples - gotta add 72
cents for Governer "Ahnald") just like the Samba Ad from Florida.

No, I don't advertise it on the site because I don't need VW breathing down
my neck for "Volks" part of the website name.  Sorta "underground"
sales.....

But I do get asked for them all the time and I am glad to help.  Order 059
998 211, Paypal always accepted (ID jim96003(-at-)earthlink.net).

Oh - Grainger can get $10 per washer because THEY CAN & do everyday.

Bosch still offers all those neat pieces individually and other distributor
kits, but only in BULK to Rebuilders.  Thatsa lot of $$$ to spend at one
time.  VW Owners comprise of such a TEENY size of that type of market, that
they're not interested in selling to that market anymore.  Vintage VWs would
disappear and it would register as an insignificant blip on their radar.  A
lot happens in 40 years......

I also searched through the Grainger online catalog and found some generic

Any leads will be appreciated...and may end up as the subject of an article
