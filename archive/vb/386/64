  Howdy folks,
   
  Been lurking on both lists for somewhile now--it's been good to be back in a bus, even though it is a bay <grin>.  Kinda been out of the show scene altogether, so sorry to those I said I would meet them at the classic/octo and bailed out.
   
  Anyways, my 2 daughters and I are planning on heading cross country in a few weeks in the 79 Westy.  Plan on leaving Temecula, CA and making our way to East Texas to visit family and then on to Georgia to visit more family then slowly make our way back home.  I know I'll be hitting up a few of you guys to catch up for sure, and would love to meet some new faces too.
   
  I haven't set any routes in stone yet, but plan to real soon.  We'll be crashing with friends and camping along the way, so we're up for anything if you've got ideas.
   
  I also need to inspect at 63 Double cab I've got in Texas, and decide whether to save or part out...it's a rusty sumbitch...so we'll see.  If anybody in Texas is interested, drop me a line...it's about an hour north of Houston.
   
  Later,
  Beto
  79 Westy (my kids are gettin' big!)
  Temecula, CA ( yeah...no more CO)
