Wouldn't it be something if this list actually helped
someone find a bus or help them out in anyway like
this list used to be .I for one only post very seldom
because of the folks that got upset if everything you
post is not dotted and crossed just right , you should
be happy if anything faintly related to type two's ,
we've lost some really knowledgeable folks off here
because of the whiners and moaners .
