Subject: Tombstone bus

Hey folks,
  I guess most of you are in Arizona. I receive the mailing list, but it's
my first time posting to it. I went to Tombstone a while back and on that
long road to Tombstone (I forgot the name of the road) there was a bus
(pre-63) sitting in a field visible from the main road. The guy said he
wanted to get rid of it, I'm sure he was talking about taking it to the junk
(I hate those people). I'm in Texas and can't go pick it up, but I can
provide rough directions. If anyone is interested, let me know.
