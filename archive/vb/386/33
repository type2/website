Subject: RE: [T2] vacuum diagnostics: engine strong but manifold vacuum 

Hold it- don't pull your engine.  I had the same problem w/ my current
engine.  A friend at a show somewhere, sometime, showed me the trick of
putting a vacuum canister in the line between the manifold and the gauge.
Needle stays steady and you get accurate readings. I don't know the
technical name for this part. Perhaps the pro's have an idea of the canister
I'm talking about??????? Ted

Don't take live to seriously--you'll never live through it....
