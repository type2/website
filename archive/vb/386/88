I have been on this list along time and Jerry has been posting his stuff all
that time. IF you happen to get in an accident and need him for a true
appraisal of your vehicle for insurance. You probably wouldn't be doing all
the whining. Sorry folks sometimes I just have to vent. Jerry Keep on doing
what you have been. Let the whiners fall to the curb.
