Check the generator brushes. It sounds like they're worn out. If there 
isn't any brush sticking up above the edge of the well they ride in then 
they need to be replaced. If you take a small wood stick, like a 
popsicle stick, and push down on one of the brushes that will usually 
make the light on the dash go out. If that works you know the brushes 
are the problem.
