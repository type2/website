Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum diagnostics: engine strong but manifold vacuum

Additional symptom (perhaps unrelated):

When pulling the plugs for the compression check, it looked as though  
#3 was running lean and #4 was running rich.

This seemed odd to me given that they're both being fed out of the  
same manifold and therefore pointed to a possible leak at the #3  
head: but where?  The cylinder-head and jug mating surface?

Or would that point to a valve issue?

I didn't verify the point gaps yet, but intend to before re-installing.

cheers,
      Tom
