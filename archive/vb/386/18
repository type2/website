I don't  have the money for that full paint job I'd like to get my  
1967 bus,  but I'd like to take care of some of the spot rust.

You know: sand,  treat with naval jelly, wash, prime, paint.   Just  
the  standard to keep the cancer from spreading.

Any suggestions on this  and/or how to match the original (albeit  
faded from almost 40 years  mostly in SoCal) white paint?  Or at least  
come  close?



Find an automotive  paint supply store and have them make have a pint  of a 
quality single stage paint, and you want Marhides rust converter.
 
Sand spots as well as possible and apply rust converter after 20 min  dry 
time apply paint, you can even use a good quality brush then sand and  buff later.
 
if you get a cheap spray gun (rent/borrow) you can blend the color so it  
takes 2" to see repairs.
