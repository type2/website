Subject: Re: Anyone using 15x5.5 Mangels?

For the record. 15x5.5J Mangels on a '65 Bus w/General UHP M+S  
205/70R15s. Good clearance behind the tires, very small or no  
clearance on the outside. (The tread width is OK, but the reinforced  
sidewall is a bit fatter than the tread.)

My wheel wells are cut out (since I've owned the bus), so it doesn't  
matter to me right now. But I'll have to either weld in the metal an  
inch higher and/or put the tires on the original rims (which are  
nasty/rusty right now).
