So those are the pics before you got your panel, now what other than 
lawn mower.
Looks like a nice body.
P & C

6V electrical system
Numbers from the generator:

Bosch
0101206067105
EG 7V 50A 26
VW2119030216

Numbers from the regulator
Bosch
0190350030
VA 7V 50A

These would seem to be 7V, wouldn't they? It seems to me I should be running a 
Bosch 6V, 45AMP, W/ Regulator attached.
