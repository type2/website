No.  Spam is unsolicited advertisements,  When you signed up for this
list, you requested the delivery of all list messages, including Jerry
Jess' notice of a bus available in Arizona, one of the best
sources of rust-free buses in the world.  JJ's message was completely
within the VB list charter, and such messages are one of the
primary purposes for the existance of the list.

If you don't like that, please unsubscribe from the list.  We obviously
aren't for you.

I'm really getting sick of people publicly slamming JJ for being his
normal helpful self.  If you think that a list member is doing something
wrong, complain to the administrator, not to the list in general.
