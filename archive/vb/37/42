Subject: rocket ship (friday)

after riding and driving buses for the last couple of weeks i got in one of my beetles to run some errands.  it was like getting into a rocket ship!  it's fast, handles well, accelerates like no one's business and can still stop on a dime.  i think everybody here needs to go out and get on of the small fast volkswagens.  if you have one but it's not running, what the heck is that about?  <grin>
