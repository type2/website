Everybody was a winner, nice weather, nice buses, nice people. But we got 
most of the loot! We dropped nearly $100 between us on tickets so we get 
called a few times.

Yes, the steering wheel is great! Took a few miles to get used to the 
smooth feel after years with the 3 layers of paint and 300 layers of dirt 
of my old wheel. After the seat, it's the biggest point of contact with 
your bus. Certainly the most skin time you share!

It was a smooth drive back, only one 15 minute stop & go for an accident on 
99.
