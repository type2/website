I don't know about that.  I happened to walk by a resto shop, and looked in
to see a shelby cobra, a rolls royce, and some kind of race car.  I'll bet
you a dollar every one of those customers is paying more than anyone on this
list would ever consider...

I'd be happy just to find someone in Phoenix who'll give me anything like
a  straight answer on what it will cost me to have my nose and rockers
replaced.  So far, the only real opportunities I've found involve more
DIY that I have time for.
