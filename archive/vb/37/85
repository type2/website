Subject: What battery do I use?

Hello, All!
   OK, as I now have the system on my '65 ready for 12 volts, what BCI group
12 volt battery do I use and will fit in the original hold-down clamp and
will have
the terminals oriented the correct way?  I remember doing this to a '64 many
years ago and found a cute(?) little battery that had a plastic spacer on
the top
and fit in the original clamp perfectly, but I can't remember what the
battery
was...
so I ask the group of experts...

Thanks in advance!
