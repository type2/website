Subject: Re: [VB] sundial vs westy

I think that the fact that there are fewer Sundials running around than there
are Westys will make Sundials more desirable, and also more valuable down the
road..  My wife and I collect Arts & Crafts, (Very heavy masculine Oak)
furniture.  When it was manufactured from about 1901 thru about 1916, bedroom
furniture was rarely purchased because it was too "Heavy" for most women's
taste.  Today, Arts & Crafts bedroom furniture is pretty rare, and most of it
is much more valuable than living and dining room pieces that were comparable
in price at the time, since not too much of it was produced or purchased.

After all is said and done, I think the most valuable camper(s) to you is the
one you own, whatever the name of the Camper Conversion company is.

I don't know about others on this list, but I bought, own, and drive my Camper
with my heart, not with my head.  If my camper is worth more or less that a
comparable Westy, who cares?  "My Camper is better than your Camper" is pretty
childlike.  I will never apologize for my camper to anyone.  It really only
matters what your ride is worth the day that you sell it.  I plan on being
burried in mine.

Just my opinion.
