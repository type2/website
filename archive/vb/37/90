List
Oh the ever sought after middle seat!!

I am wanting to re-sleeve my middle seat grab bars (63) and noticed that the
material on the dash grab handle is the same. since the dash handle is
reproduced does anyone know who makes them or can supply me with that
material? I am also in the process of making molds of the chrome end pieces
(Deluxes and Standards 62 to 67) so I can reproduce them. My idea is to sell
the pieces separately, to allow people to either fix the seats they have, or
to sell them a conversion kit to add to a bay window seat.
If this sounds like a good idea to anyone please p-mail me to let me know,
for right know I am only making one and reproducing them for sale is only an
idea.
Thanks
Shawn
