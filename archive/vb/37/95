Subject: Harry and Karl WIN At OCTO.

OCTO held a great meet. Never seen so many busses there.

Harry and Karl are once again just about the winningest guys I have
ever seen. Congrats on all the raffle stuff you guys got. I know you
are great supporters of all the clubs that run the raffles.

Harry, enjoy your steering wheel.
Chris.
