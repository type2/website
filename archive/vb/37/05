Chris,
Thanks for the suggestion, you are right, I did need to prime the pump, I
did it by filling the pump with fuel, then holding my finger over the
discharge tube until pressure brought fuel through the pump, then I hooked
up the line and the filter filled up.
One problem I found, that I had overlooked before was that the accelerator
cable tube through the fan shroud had slipped out and was jammed against the
accelerator linkage in the carb, when I pumped the gas pedal, the cable
flexed, but there was no action in the carburetor. Once I corrected the
tube, and primed the pump, the engine started and things are back to normal.
I sure appreciate your help.
John Flowers
