Subject: Re: [VB] unwanted moisture in my bus!

one solution i have found for wiper shaft grommets are, go to your local
headshop and pick up some of the grommets you use on a water pipe, bong,
etc., or whatever the politically correct term is on this list.  the inner
and outer diameter are almost perfect and they are very cheap, like 10
cents.  im sure you can find them elsewhere, but you can definitely get the
correct size there.  if you cant find them, ive got a bunch so just email me
and ill send you a pair for 20 cents and a stamp.
