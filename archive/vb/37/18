Subject: Starter Alternative

Hey All,

I remember at one point someone on the list said that some kind of starter 
for a rabbit or something will work on a bus.  I think I'm gonna need one 
and wondering if there is a cheaper alternative method to just getting one 
at pepboys or autozone.  I need a 12volt.  My bus decided to quit at lunch 
today;(  Gonna try to push him again after work.  I think he was flooded.  
he would start after a push at a weak idle and w/ gas would die.  Just gave 
up and got back to work.  I arced my starter and NOTHING happened.  Checked 
my ground strap on trany and battery terms ans all the starter wires.  WTF  
Guess I'll see if there is spark at the points.  I have an old coil in the 
bus but don't really think my coil and starter retaliated at the same time.  
My starter has been weird for awhile, so I'm hoping he was just flooded and 
needs a starter!  Haven't missed work from the bus for over a Year!

Thanks for letting me babble and have a great weekend!
