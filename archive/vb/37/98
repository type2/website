Subject: RE: [VB] Fuchs for sale

>For all those interested in the Fuchs that I am selling. I believe they are
15", they are not chromed and missing center caps. I want $500 plus shipping
and handling. 

$500!  You must be kidding?  Since these are from a 68 or 69 they will be
the old style Fuchs and probably be 15"x 5.5" or 6".

Unless these wheels are perfect try more like $250-$300.

Everyone knows Wheel Enhancement is a huge rip-off, but absolutely perfect
wheels go for $800 a set.  Unless you get into weird sizes like 15"/16" by
8" or  9" then try like $500-$600 for one wheel.

Be different and do cookie cutters or phone dials on your bus, they are
almost free and very unique.
