Subject: Re: [VB] Lost Causes

If you are looking at restoring a "lost cause" bus and don't live in Cali or
the southwest there are only a handful of options.  Kelly aka Metwiz has
been around for a while and does quality work.  I have seen his operation
and he really does know busses.  He and his crew do great work.  He does the
rust repair & body work, you have to find someone else to do the paint.  He
also sells parts if you want to attempt it yourself.  He has been a great
resource for me.

The other great source is Kustum Coach Werks in Grand Junction, Colorado.
They are doing my Binz.  They are a complete shop and both bodywork and
paint.  Top quality work.  I'm sure most listees are familiar with his
recent custom double door sunroof walkthrough slammed Barndoor panel.
Believe me, that bus was a lost cause when he started.

You an check out what they have done to the Binz at:
