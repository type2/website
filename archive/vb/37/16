Hi list-

Can't wait for the show, but I'm too old to remember how I got there 
last year (the mind is the second thing to go?).  I tried the OCTO 
website, but it appears to be under construction, and the old site 
won't come up.

Can somebody give me directions coming north from San Diego?

Gracias!
