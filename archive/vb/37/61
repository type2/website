Subject: Re: [VB] Crank History w/OCTO P.S.

Lets face it VW stayed with things that worked!  Crank starting works
(even if it is just a back up), generators WORK (abet not as consistent
or strong  a power source).  You know the saying , if it ain't
broke......

Sure all of those things could have been added, but the car/bus was to
be as cheep and functional as possible.  The ultimate LOW TECH.
Besides, look at what they came up with when they "modernized"  ....the
rabbit and the fox.   Yuk!!!!
