And that's exactly why I put "my town" in the signature line of every 
email I send to the list...including the one you commented on.

  Doesn't matter though, the odds of any bus folks ever making it way

Jim Share moved to Abilene though. It's only a couple of hours 
away...and that's about the best it's gonna get!
