Subject: 40 HP lives!!!

Hey All,
Well I got the 40 HP that I "half"  built in the 64 started and running today!  It actually sounds pretty strong.  There just seems to be a lot of valve noise.  Can anyone tell me the right valve clearances for the 40 HP?  The manuals all say that the setting should be .006" for all type 1 engines, but I think I heard somewhere that you should set them at .008" for the 40 HP.  Anyone know if this is true?  Would the setting beiong off .002" cause excessive valve chatter or is it more likely that the noise is just because the engine has been sitting for about a year?
