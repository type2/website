Subject: End play at 1am

Ok.  I've stopped for some coffee and a question.  The book says that
.003 is the low spec for end play with the shims installed.  I've got
.0025.  The crank is all torqued down and spins like smooth silky
butter.  Is this still too tight a clearance??

Also, can I use "used" shims?  Or must I get brand new ones??

Thanks!

Steve
