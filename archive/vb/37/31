There's a car show here in my town tommarrow. I just found out about 
it. It's an "everything" car show with a classic VW class. I'm gonna 
take my bus down. Even though it's no show car, I figure I gotta go 
and "represent"! I'm gonna take a bunch of my VW bus junk (toys, 
books, ect.) and try to make it fun. We've got lots of VW's here and 
I don't know how many will show up. But I definatly have the only 
actively driven splitwindow bus in town. It should be fun seeing the 
reaction from the hot rod guys, the low riders, and the rice burner 
boys. I made up a sheet proudly proclaiming that my bus "goes 
45mph....50 at best!"

Yee haw!
