Subject: Throwout fork Q

I had to cut my old and shot throwout fork (due to wasted bushings and a a
stuck one at that) BTW< a 226 H pulled the lever off just great, but you
need to use a useless SAE 9 mm socket as a spacer. :)
The fork I had was off a TIII trans doctored for lowereing, but didn't have
the arms all the way around the shaft, which I believe is a 76-79 2L part?
It installed ok, but can this work? I don't want to make a big mistake here
before I install the engine...
