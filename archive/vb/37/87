Subject: Re: [VB] 40 HP lives!!!

.006 should be fine, and .008 won't hurt it either (I've seen some engine
builders run em even looser during engine break-in, then set them right
after the valves 'tighten up', but I don't suggest doing this).  I would
probably look at the fuel you're using, remember that those engines were
meant for Leaded fuel.  I run some Marvel Mystery Oil in my super unleaded
gas (to help simulate LEADED fuel, because the lead lubricated the top end
of the engine), even though I have unleaded heads. The engine probably
doesn't need it, but I guarantee it doesn't hurt to keep the top end
lubricated, and may cause the engine to last longer.

> Hey All,
> Well I got the 40 HP that I "half"  built in the 64 started and running
today!  It actually sounds pretty strong.  There just seems to be a lot of
valve noise.  Can anyone tell me the right valve clearances for the 40 HP?
The manuals all say that the setting should be .006" for all type 1 engines,
but I think I heard somewhere that you should set them at .008" for the 40
HP.  Anyone know if this is true?  Would the setting beiong off .002" cause
excessive valve chatter or is it more likely that the noise is just because
the engine has been sitting for about a year?
