<<<<<I don't know about that.  I happened to walk by a resto shop, and
looked in
to see a shelby cobra, a rolls royce, and some kind of race car.  I'll bet
you a dollar every one of those customers is paying more than anyone on this
list would ever consider...>>>>>

Well you could be rite, then again you'd be suprised at some of the cash
that is spent on restoring some of the rarer busses. But they would probably
not admit it. Of course your talking about cars that cost thousands of
dollars more than the VW did new .
Most of your normal resto shops  won't touch a VW, and same for body shops
around here. They are looking for the quickie wreck rebuilds that are still
a POS after they are done with them.
Good workmanship is just hard to come by no matter where you are. Nuff said
, later

And Dan the Binz is lookin good, nice belly pans by the way ,,they guy that
did them must be a genious !!!!.. ( ROFLMAO)
