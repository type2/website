Subject: Crank History w/OCTO P.S.

Hey all.

I just watched Modern Marvels on the History Channel
(one of my FAVORITE networks) it was an episode on
electricity in cars.
In America, the Starter was used in every car by the
year 1915.

So then why the heck do VWs have cranks and crank
aprons into the mid 1950's??!!  as backup?

(By the way did you know the term "being cranky" comes
from someone who was pissed after a series of failed
attempts to crank his engine.)

Also, alternators were first used in 1960.  Why did VW
not use them until almost 10 years later?

Don't get me wrong, I love VW engineering. But when
you look at it this way, they seemed late to let go of
some things.

P.S. Look for me at OCTO: Black 21 window with red
trim. Here are some pics I put on Everett's site. I
just took my family to the beach for the first time in
DARTHVW. (BTW, I found him through Everett's
classifieds last July!)
