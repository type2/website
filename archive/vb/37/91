Subject: starter=engine pull

Hey All,

Got my bus home no problem Friday after work when my starter failed.  Pulled 
the starter Saturday morning had it tested and he was dead.  Went for the 
$40 dollar flaps replacement wishing I had $85 for a brand new bosche one my 
vwflaps had.  Found out that the shaft had broken off inside the bushing in 
the tranny.  Fought it for a bit and said well the girlfriend at work lets 
do my 1st engine pull by myself.  Got it out and back in 2 hrs!  Not bad on 
a super rough parking lot on a pretty steep incline!  Put the new starter in 
and it sounds a lot healthier on start up. Only thing that concerns me is 
the flywheel had some wear on the teeth as were there shavings in the bell 
housing.  I put a used 12v flywheel on about a year ago that was in good 
condition.  The old and new starter gear fit perfectly and I have the proper 
6v to 12v bushing.  I was hoping the clanking I hear at start up would go 
away... it didn't.  What more can I do to have normal well on my flywheel 
ring gear.  My bus has been jerky/jumpy in first so maybe the FW is warped a 
bit?  Any ideas?  Just thought I tell ya all about my first pull!

TIA
Eric
