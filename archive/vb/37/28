Subject: RE: [VB] PUsh Rod Tubes

ALL adjustable push rod tubes leak, SCAT's (double o-ringed), Autocrafts (a
little better), and even all the 3 styles from Taiwan. The best I have seen
are the Taiwan nutted style (with a little silicon), but they don't expand
with the engine. There was a guy here in Havasu who was making BILLET push
rod tubes that didn't leak, but that was because he used and extremely high
thread count per inch and had over 3 inchs of thread. These cost over 80
dollars a set and he was loosing money if his time counted for anything.
STOCK works the best.

Has anyone ever used the SCAT push rod tubes that are spring loaded?  The 
concept seems a good one but I have not met anyone who has actually used the

SCAT variety only the earlier ones which were not entirely successful.  
Opinions?  Real life stories?
