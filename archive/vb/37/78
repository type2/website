Subject: Local show...I won!!!

Went to the local car show here. It was at the Goodfellow Airforce 
Base Recreation Center located at Lake Nasworthy here in San Angelo, 
TX. The weather was absolutely increadible all day long. It was a 
general car show with classes for street rods, drag cars, antiques, 
pre this and post that, and mini trucks, and euros, and so on. there 
was a volkswagen class. There were 4 other VW's there besides me and 
I won! My old beater bus won! I did take some bus toys, and books, 
and the endangered species picture, and opened up the doors and made 
it all look fun. But I think the thing I heard the most all day long 
was a result of me having the safari window's wide open..."did those 
come on these old busses?"...."Honey, look at these windows!" It was 
a blast and everyone smiled as they checked out my old bus. I got a 
nice Texas shaped plaque and I'm grinning ear to ear.

Just goes to show I guess. Sometimes it pays to just show up. Also 
won a door prize of dinner for 2 at Red Lobster...my wife is very 
happy!
