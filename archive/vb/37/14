Subject: Re: [VB] sundial vs westy

Hey Chuck,

I've had Westfalias, a Sundial and my daily driver for the past 11 years is
an EZ Camper. So I've always been interested in the variations of campers
and especially interested in non-Westfalias. From what I've seen, the later
campers are all about the same quality. Westfalia is a little nicer in some
regards, and Riviera is usually the lower one on the totem pole of quality.
They all have about the same layout, and if yours was a panel you won't get
the closet window as P&C mentioned. My 66 EZ Camper was a panel.

As far as resale goes, I think that a nice Sundial will outsell a beat
Westy anyday. But that's pretty obvious. Resale in collectible cars is like
any other hobby...condition is the main thing. You could have the rarest
bus out there, but if it's a POS you won't sell it (or not fast). Or, you
just have to find a sucker (like me) to sell it to! :)

I've always said that it's much more difficult to restore a non-Westfalia
than it is to restore a Westfalia. You have to fly blind for a lot of it.
There's not that much reference material out there, and everybody has an
opinion on how it should be. Most people don't understand campers and the
hundreds of variations they came in.

Hope that helps,

Scott
