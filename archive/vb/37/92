Subject: Almost free '67 project!! SF Bay Area

Hello All!

Been long long time since I've inflicted my writing on the List.  Ever since
that first trip to Eugene, OR, and the subsequent jaunts to the CA North
Coast, we've been wrapped up in the gory entrails of escrow.   Eating
escrow, that is...one selling our house...to buy another near Redway.
Yeesh!  I wanted to write full reports of those trips, but I'll sum it up:
We made it there and back, with no problems!

To the point:  Our first Type II ('67 Kombi)is still in our garage, sans
engine, body in pieces (doors off/dissassembled, windows out (some missing)
dash electrics removed but labelled and easily put back, front seat (1/3-2/3
bench) new looking upholstery, body straight but rust underneath, some cut
out...left rear hatch hinge broken (how?), tranny very worn, howls, but
works, springplate to RGB holes munged up by idiot sticking SAE threaded
bolts in...needs repair before rolling, brakes good, new steering box, new
but really cheap Goodyear tyres, and a bunch of other fun stuff.

A project, not for the faint of heart, short of focus, or about-to-move
person.  Almost free to good home....you come get before November 9th or
thereabouts.  If you feel any pity, bring a few hundred smackeroos, but
otherwise, just bring a trailer!

Originally, I had asked Bob from J&W to help me swap tranny assemblies from
the '67 in question to our '66 and vice-versa.  Payment for this deed (about
1/2 day) was to be the '67.  But Bob is busy now too, and he's not attached
to the bus (neither is his wife).  If I do something else with it, he'll not
be sad.  I just need to reimburse him for his time/effort.  ($200 for the
bus seems reasonable?!)

Call or write for more info if interested....we're located west of Santa
Rosa (1/2 hour) in the North Bay Area, CA.
