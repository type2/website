Subject: Crowsfoot wheels

I was getting together all the crowsfoot wheels that I
could find in my pile 'o stuff today to get a complete
set for the '57 singlecab that I recently got, and
discovered something interesting.  The one wheel that
came with the bus had two different dates on it.

The rim (outside) part of the wheel had the date 2/57
but the web (the wide-five part) had the date 7/57! 
Thinking that this was curious, I checked the other
four that I had on hand and found the following:

Wheel       Outside date    Inside date

#1             4/58            12/58

#2             2/59             5/59

#3 and #4      1/59             1/59

This brings to mind a couple of questions.  I thought
that there were only 1957 and 1958 crowsfoot wheels
produced.  Were there later wheels produced for people
who bent/destroyed the earlier ones?  And why would
wheel #1 have a lapse of 8 months between the two
dates.  Any ideas?

Thanks for your thoughts.
