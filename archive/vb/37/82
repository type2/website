it's fast, handles well, accelerates like no one's business and can still 
stop on a dime.  i think everybody here needs to go out and get on of the 
small fast volkswagens.  if you have one but it's not running, what the heck

I have also been driving my bus as a daily driver for the last 2+ months. My 
944 Turbo race car is coming out of the shop next week and will again be my 
daily driver. ~3000lbs, >>250 hp, wide tires, race seat, roll bar, 5 point 
seat belts. I can't wait for my rocket ship back.
