Subject: electrical contacts corrosion

What is the best way to clean and maintain electrical
contacts, especially like the tail light stuff.  Would
a dilectic silicon grease applied after electrical
contact cleaner be good?  Is there a conductive
silicon grease for this application?  I seem to
remember something about   applying this type grease
to spade connectors before mating the two together.
