Subject: Re: [VB] electrical contacts corrosion

Dielectric grease does NOT conduct electricity.
Use it AFTER you make a good solid connection
to prevent corrosion on the other surfaces.

The surfaces can be cleaned with a good electrical
contact cleaner, and the connectors moved in and
out a couple of times to wear off the corrosion.

If the connection is loose, carefully crimp the female
end a tiny bit to tighten the fit..

Then, apply the vaseline.
