Here's pictures of the accessory boat that fits on top of a bus:

Also for a short time VW actually made some real boats with inboard VW engines in them called the Volksliner.  Do a search for Volksliner on The Samba and you will find 6 pictures of one there.  For better pictures go to
http://www.edu-television.com/gallery/album21/aac and you can scroll through a series of 10 pictures in better light (being towed by a microbus too).

VW made boats? Or are you talking a high top like mine?
