Subject: Re: [VB] BRake spring help still needed

Hi Dan,
The straight leg of the spring goes against the forward lower edge of  the 
square tube that goes across the splash pan area.  The hook of the  spring goes 
against the rear of the brake pedal lever just above where the push  bar 
cotter pin goes through.
