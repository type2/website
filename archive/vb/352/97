Subject: 21 or 23 Window in the Monterey area

Believe it or not I will be getting married in June down in Monterey! I know, i know, who woulda thunk it!?
 My fiancee' and I are looking for a STOCK  looking 21 or (preferably) 23 Window bus to cart us and our group (25 max) from Lovers Point to the Sardine Factory at Canery Row (maybe a half mile from each other?) A few minor deviations are acceptable but we prefer factory to cal-look.
 
We would prefer a stock color combo as well, and no lowered buses thank you. If you have one and are willing please email me at croftyest(-at-)yahoo.com and let me know your rate. I can fill you in on the details and timeline when I return your email.
