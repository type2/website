Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Rear tail light BRIGHT alternative?

I tried some LED bulbs in my 64 bus and was sorley disappointed. They don't
make use of the reflector AT ALL, so a
regular incandesent bulb was a whole lot brighter than the LED.

I did one side with the LED, and had a friend hit the brakes. In the
daytime, I couldn't tell the brake light was working unless I squatted down
to the level of the bulb.

LED bulbs (at least the ones I tried) were utterly useless in my opinion
(mostly due to the fact that they don't use the reflector at all!). If you
want to make a big difference in your taillight, contact cement some
aluminum foil in the housing (shiney side out!) to make it reflect the light
better. This (cheaper) mod will make the taillights a whole lot brighter
than some LED is going to.

If someone finds some LED's that work better than the regular bulb with a
good reflector, post a side by side pic and i'll eat my words.

Just my measly experience.  ;-)
