Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Rear tail light BRIGHT alternative?

Um, but the website also says this:
     "LED bulbs are generally not as bright as standard incandescent bulbs, 
they
      have many advantages over filament bulbs (longer life, faster on/off 
times,
     lower power consumption, more vivid colors) but brightness is not one 
of them"

So...  are they brighter or just more fun?
Sorry, just looking for clarification before I run out and buy them...  they 
do look cool though...
