Subject: Re: [VB] Help: excessively high oil pressure

Hello Fig  OK now we know what kind of case the flywheel relief regulaes the 
pressure at about 35psi. if it has the wrong spring the pressure will be too 
high. it should have the short spring anfd the pulley valve the longer spring . 
I really dont think it is the pump. bigger pumps will give more volume.  
double check the relief valves both of them and take a lite and make sure that 
there isnt an extra plunger in either and that the plunger moves in them freely  
later and have fun  Mark Dearing
