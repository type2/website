Hi Brian,
Where you are in the country we have heard it is just about impossible  today 
to find a split screen, so it is cool to hear you found one.   Take your time 
dealing with the state, and try not to get too frustrated.   As for "Antique 
Vehicle Title" make sure to check out the state rules  on that type of title 
and check into insurance before getting locked in.   We found that going that 
way one was limited to when and how far (750  miles with state farm about ten 
years ago) you were allowed to drive  it per year!!  For us it was cheaper by 
the mile, and easier just  to get liability insurance.  Plus we even bumped up 
the  coverage for medical (ie in case we get in an accident with a large bus 
and 50  people need to go to the hospital).
