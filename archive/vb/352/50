Subject: Rear tail light BRIGHT alternative?

http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=7958284613&rd=1&sspagename=STRK%3AMEWA%3AIT

This looked like a cool alternative for normal rear tail light bulbs.  LED 
is definately brighter and will last a lot longer than normal bulbs.

Anyone running these?  Or another type of LED setup?

No connection with seller.
