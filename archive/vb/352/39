The trick for towing is to ask up front for a flat bed truck.

Specifying that you've had damage from having it towed
from the wheel lifts in the past and don't want to have
them risk a damage claim, or inform them that the steering
wheel doesn't lock.

If part of the bus rolls on the road, it must be licensed
and they can get in trouble, but if it's on the flatbed, it
doesn't matter as it's off the road.

Avoid the licensing thing altogether by requesting a flatbed.
