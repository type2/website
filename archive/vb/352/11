A friend of mine has one.  It's fairly light ansd can easily be lifted

and flipped by him and I.  It's a pretty neat thing.  Coupled with the

camper it's on, it makes a perfect weekend lake getaway 
vehicle.

I think all he's looking for is the outboard motor it came with. Or 
one like it.

So, pick it up.  If you want pictures of it, I'll see...
