Hey All,

Trying to find a Splitty (or early Bay) for a buddy of mine.  He's got $3,000
cash and isn't looking for a major project.   Preferably something running, he
can handle any little stuff... brake work and minor welding.  Just looking for
something to be rolling this Summer.

If anyone knows of anything around NE Ohio, Western PA, please let me know.
I'm checking all the usual online sites, but just wanted to get the word out.

Thanks,
Aaron
