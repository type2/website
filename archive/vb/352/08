I think I saw this boat at BBB a couple of years ago.  Very cool!  Designed
to fit nicely upside down on the roof of a splittie.  It was a little crude,
but would be a must have accessory for the true split collector like you
Jerry!

Snap that thing up!

Tom Buese-if you have to ask how much they are worth, you can't afford it?
