in germany and japan, at least, people have been arrested for public 
wall-warting. the guy in germany was charged with theft of something 
like 4/100s of a euro's worth of electricity. hadn't heard of any 
stories from the US, but since you can be tasered in the DC subway 
for eating a candy bar, it might be best to ask for permission first!
