Subject: Final update on brake pedal return spring adventure

For the archive, I installed the spring with the boss, well both bosses, there were two. I shoved one boss deep inside the spring adn the other I mounted along with the pin. I torqued it down and the pedal swung back with plenty of elan, as they say in France. When I torqued it down too much, the pedal hung up a bit so I loosened it and it seemed fine. I then connected the push rod mechanism up and RATS the pedal stopped returning all the way. I spqayed some lubricant into the master cylinder where the push rod goes but it didn't seem to do anything. So back to the tow dance, let off brake pull pedal up with toe. Then all of a sudden today, Viola! The pedal starts returnign with verve! I haven't looked underneath to see why, yet. But it is workign well. Maybe ingnorace is bliss, but with braking components it can also be deadly, so I will check to make sure everything is in place.
