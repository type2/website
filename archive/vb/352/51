Subject: Re: [VB] Rear tail light BRIGHT alternative?

I just bought some 1157 replacement leds from
http://www.superbrightleds.com/
and they are much less than the ebay ones.  (About $5
each.)  However, I think that to use them, I'll have
to get a solid state flasher, because they use such a
low amount of power that the thermal flashers think
your bulb is burned out.  Tail lights look great,
though.
