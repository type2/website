Sam,
VeeWee's will work but you will have to have more or at least the same 
out put current out of the 6 DC to 12 DC volt converter to run a low 
power 12 DC to 110 AC inverter. We have seen 75 watt 12 to 110 which is 
all you need for the cell phone. Just mark you outlets well as not to 
plug the wrong voltage requirements.  We saw a 75 watt unit at "SAM's" 
club but that was awhile back. 2 for 15 bucks! And we will keep looking.
P & C
