I think you hit the nail on the head. The boss is open faced toward the spring
and sits outside of the spring, sort of cocked really. I imagine that's why I
don't haev enough tension. When it was out I tried to fit the boss inside the
spring and it did fit, but just barely.I guess I'll try it again this weekend.
What a PITA.

  I recall it is a little tough, things just don't work quite right.
