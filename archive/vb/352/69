A few thoughts:

1. My Motorola cellphone has a 3.6V battery, and uses 5.9V from the
charger. If your '63 is like my '64, there is likely enough of a
voltage drop along the way that voltage in the light switch area is 6V
or a little less. If your charger voltage is near 6V you could just
make a connection using an extra plug-in that fits your phone and hook
it right in the the ignition switch. It works for me and so far battery
life does not seem to be shortened.

2. If you can count on some sun, you can get a solar charger here:

cellphone's voltage by using Radio Shack components.

3. If you have a full battery in your notebook computer, you can charge
the cellphone with a USB port charger:

4. Stop for lunch, sit near an outlet, and your phone can usually
charge up pretty well, but you can't just "squat-and-gobble" at a fast
food place for this to work.

5. Stop at a library to check your email (and VB list) and either plug
your charger into the wall or look for an open USB port...

6. If you can charge with AC each night, but your charge doesn't last
through the day, maybe a new cellphone battery (or a second battery) is
in your future.

Good luck!

It's nearly warm enough now in Fargo, ND, to think about actually
driving it again after 5 months!
