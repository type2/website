Subject: Re: [VB] Rear tail light BRIGHT alternative?

If you look under the products heading and scan down the page, you will find
a load resistor kit to wire accross your flasher LED bulb so as to simulate
a filament bulb. Only $4.95 each. Not a bad price. For only about $25 yoiu
can equip your dub with nice really bright tail lights. The lights should
also work on 6V with about 1/2 the brightness. Just need to use one of the
larger bulbs.
