Does  anyone know if you can get a 6v to 110V inverter to be able to charge 
one's  cell phone while in an early bus?



Hi Sam,
What you need is to get a 6 to 12 volt inverter.  Wire on a cigarette  
lighter socket, and buy the proper 12 volt automotive charger for your cell  phone.
  If you want to buy the 6 to 12 volt inverter, we have one  we can spare.
