They might have existed back in the day but now you'd probably have to
make one if you wanted one.

If you can get a 12 V charging cord for your phone, you might have more
success.  If you're really lucky, it might just work on 6 V.  Try it and
see...  the worst that can probably happen is that your phone won't charge.

If the output of your 110 V charger is less than about 4.7 V DC or so, you
might be able to build a simple regulator with Radio Shack parts to drop
the Bus' 6 V down for your phone.  If your phone doesn't take a normal
power connector, you'll have to cut up an existing charger for the
connector.

One option is to use a 12 V charging cord for your phone and a small 
12 V gel-cell battery.  I have one here that is 12 V, 7 Ah, weighs about
3 pounds (1.4 kg), and is about 6x1.5x3.75 inches (15x3.5x9.5 cm).  It
cost me about $15 at the local electronics distributor (_not_ Radio
Shack.)  A battery this size would fully charge most cell phone
batteries maybe 3 to 7 times before becoming depleted itself.  When the
gel-cell gets depleted, you can charge it with a small (1 or 2 amp)
battery charger made for car or motorcycle batteries.  If you do this,
put a reasonable fuse (5 A or so) in the positive wire between the
battery and the cigarette lighter socket, as the battery is capable of
several hundred amps of current in a short-circuit situation.

If you want to be clever, you can buy a 6 V gel cell battery and wire it
in series with your Bus.  Your cigarette lighter socket ground goes to
the Bus body.  A wire from the Bus +6 V goes to the negative side of the
battery.  Your cigarette lighter socket hot goes to the positive side of
the battery.  The 6 V from the battery gets added to the 6 V from the
battery/generator and you've got 12 V.

The super extra sneaky hidden bonus part of this is that when you're not
actively charging the cell phone, you can rewire the 6 V battery so it
is charged by your Bus!  Just connect the battery negative to the Bus
body and the battery positive to a hot-all-the-time wire in the Bus.
Even if you're not driving, your starting battery will charge up the gel
cell without too much loss of capacity.

You can install a DPDT switch to automate this process, if you like.

Unfortunately, the Web and 6 V inverters only missed each other by about
30 years or so.

Good luck!
