Hi John,
Are you using a generator or alternator style fuel pump?  If the  former, did 
you make sure the fuel pump push rod did not rise more than 13 mm  above the 
fuel pump intermediate flange?  The latter requires a height  measurement that 
we do not have.  
  If you install the alternator type fuel pump with the earlier  generator 
push rod you will rip the fuel pump diaphragm.  
  Could also be a worn out shut off valve and/or cracked float or too  heavy 
of float in the carb.
