Subject: Brake pedal return spring replacement

Bus Volks,
I've been trying for the past few days to correctly replace the brake pedal return spring but to no avail. I have the spring on now, but it doesn't feel right. The brake pedal is rubbing against the floor pan, so it seems the arm is not over far enough. I haev the spring on so that the hooked end is on the pedal arm and the flat end rests on top of the brake pedal stop just in front of the master cylinder. The spring is sandwiched bewteen the arm and a bevelled metal donut which has the open side facing toward the spring. My sense is that the spring is not in their right but I have no reference material. Anyone help???
