Subject: Re: [VB] Help: excessively high oil pressure

Volks

It looks like I might have found the answer to my oil pressure problem. I 
had already established that the oil pressure relief valve was free in its 
bore and had the correct spring. Then I realised I had a dual relief case. 
Over the weekend I tried to removed the flywheel side relief valve and, sure 
enough, it was jammed solidly in its bore. It looks like it's been attacked 
with a large flat screwdriver and flared.

I left the complete engine with an ACVW engineering shop this morning. They 
will remove the jammed valve and maybe bore it out for an oversize valve. 
Then they'll run the engine on the bench and monitor its vital signs to let 
me know if it's AOK.

Thanks to all those who shared info and knowledge.
