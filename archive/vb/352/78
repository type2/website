Polish it to a shine, get it gold plated, plug the pieces together, and
enclose them in a vacuum or a nice nitrogen or noble gas atmosphere.

However, unless you work for the phone company, it's hard to come by
400 gallon tanks of nitrogen. So...

Yes.  You have to evaluate the condition of the contacts after the
cleaner.  Some of them will clean up fine with just a spray of the
cleaner, and some of them need mechanical help (a wire brush or
sandpaper) to totally clean up.

I have seen both ideas on when to put the grease on: put grease on, then
plug together, OR, plug together, then put grease on.  If you unplug the
engine-room connectors on new cars (be careful of the tiny plastic
locking tabs) you'll sometimes find grease in the terminal cavities that
was apparently put there on the production line.  On the other hand,
these terminals are also designed with high wiping forces for good
contact - they probably effectively squeeze the grease out of the way
when mated.  Connectors on old VWs may not do this.

>Is there a conductive silicon grease for this application?

There is conductive grease, but you probably don't want it.  All it
probably does is increase the risk of a leak or short to ground.  But if
you want some for some other reason, many anti-sieze compounds have lots
of metallic particles in them.
