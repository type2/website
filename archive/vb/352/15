My best time for pulling a motor and tranny out, and stripping the tranny  
down to the center section was 3 1/2 hours.   I drove the bus  into the garage 
with bumper and all on, there were no hitches, and I had no  help.  Your 
situation may differ.   Best to give it a  weekend for the swap, as there are 
probably other things to take care of when  the engine/trans are out.  like the 
shift bushings as VeeWee says.
 
I never had to rebuild an RGB on the road.   But they aren't that  hard.  the 
late ones are trickier, as they have that freeze plug that has  to be removed 
to get to the inner stub axle nut to remove the stub axle to  get to the 
inner bearings.  I think some of the tranny rebuild places  will rebuild the RGBs.
