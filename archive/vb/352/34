Subject: Garage Sale Funny

Had a garage sale today and the DC was parked out front(it's a straight OG 
paint '62) .  A guy comes along and says "hey, wanna sell that beat up old 
VW?"   "Uh...no thanks" I say..."I'll give ya 3 grand.  That's more than its 
worth!" he replies  I paused for a second, and said"Well, I turned down 10K 
so, I think I'll say no"   He says "will you take 12 ?"    I looked back at 
him and say "um, you go from 3 to 12 just like that?? Worthless huh?"    He 
just walked away.  I thought that was kind of funny.
