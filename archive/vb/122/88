Subject: re:rear gear boxes

i remember finding some type of hand pump for getting the transmission oil
in the small hole that is at an extremely difficult angle to reach. i left
it inhouston with a friend of mine...hopefully i can find another when the
time comes...other wise it is a real pain filling the center plug.
