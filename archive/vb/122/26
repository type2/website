Subject: RE: [VB] My new tires and wheels

I am going to try Cooper SRM II's shortly. There are 106 a piece
installed and balanced by my local dealer.
195/75/14 load range D 2000+ lbs! they aren't highway rib, but I don't
know about m and s ratings for the harder core types. I see bad logging
roads at worst, and need tough tires for that, I've gone through three
puncture/repair cycles in one day on two tires on my old D0dge van, so
if these hold up, I'll let everyone know the scoop.

>205/70/15 Pirelli Scorpians look and work great. They have a load range

1525 <

Are those the LT load "C" tires?

Most people are selling the "P" tires and I have found that the "LT" are
hard to find.

The tires look awesome so please report back as to how they perform.
