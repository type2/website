The only time this is true is when you are in the business of selling
generators and regulators.  :)  Yes, there are many checks you can do.

The simplest test is to measure the battery voltage with everything
shut off; you should have 12.6 volts on a fully charged battery.  Then
start the engine, rev it up to around 2000 RPM, and re-check the voltage;
it should have gone up at least a volt to 13.6 volts or more at the
battery.  If you see this, your charging system is at least trying;
if you don't get any increase, try goosing the engine a little more --
but you should definitely see something by 3000 RPM.  If not, your
charging system isn't working.

Is the generator warning light on the dash working?  If not, fix it -
this light helps provide a little current to the generator/regulator
to get things started and if it isn't working the charging system can
refuse to work.

That's no good.  You should have 12 volts or more on D+ and something
more than zero on DF.

Close.  Disconnect the regulator completely from the generator.
Tie DF on the generator to ground, and measure between ground and
D+ on the generator.  Start the engine and rev it up; you will
probably get nothing at idle, 12 volts as soon as you start to
rev up the engine, and 24 volts or more as you continue to rev
the engine.  Do this test for only as long as it takes to get
a reading as you are running the generator at full unregulated
output.  If this test is good, your generator is putting out and
your regulator is suspect.  If you get no joy here, the generator
is probably bad.

One thing that will help is to clean all the terminals and
connections at the battery, generator, regulator, and starter.

The original wiring diagram for your '64 (regulator on top of
generator) can be seen at http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring/bus-62-usa.jpg .
If the regulator isn't on top of the generator, use
http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring/bus-65-usa.jpg .  You can see that this
is quite similar to the stock '71 Bug wiring at
http://www.vintagebus.com/wiring/1302_USA_from_September_1970.jpg .

Also, welcome to the list!  Don't forget the Library 
http://www.type2.com/library/library.htm and the Archives
http://www.type2.com/archive.html .  If you don't have any manuals yet,
http://www.type2.com/library/reading.htm has a good list.

Good luck!
