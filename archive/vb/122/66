My friend is looking for a decent bus to drive as a beater. Looking to spend around $3000. Needs to be a running/driving camper/kombi/standard/deluxe (no panels... yet) small hatch (63 and earlier) prefered but not a must. He's in Houston and would like for it to be within 300 or so miles from here. Shipping from CA or Europe is a possiblity but he only wants to spend around $3k so that must include the $800 or so for shipping.

 There's one on The Samba that is perfect (61 seagull/mango standard) Does anyone on here know that guy? He didn't list a phone # 



Thanks,

Brian

61 Chevrolet Brookwood 

62 RestoCal Sedan
