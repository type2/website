My Grandma's '74 Bug had one of these on it; it seemed to work OK but
the glass cracked right after we got it.  I have seen a very similar
filter for sale at Pep Boys - there are different housings for different
size fuel hoses but the elements are the same.  Pep Boys also sells
three-packs of elements for them.  I think it's sold under the
Purolator brand there.
