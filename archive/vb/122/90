Send your VIN number and &euro 15,- to
the museum accepts CASH in the equivalent of 15 euro as payment,
so there is no need to get currency changed. allow 4 weeks for processing.

Address:
Vehicle Identity Certificate
STIFTUNG AUTOMUSEUM VOLKSWAGEN
Dieselstrabe 35 - 38446 Wolfsburg, Germany

and you will recieve a verry nice document which states:
Build date, delivery date, destination of delivery, along with the original
color of the paintwork
and interior and any factory fitted extras
