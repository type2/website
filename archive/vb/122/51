Cool!

Figure out a way to give it a longer lever arm to pull on.  All you
really need is a piece of steel with a flatted hole in one end to go
over the throttle shaft, or even weld a piece onto the throttle arm
you have now.  This way you can use the original return spring but
let the cruise module use less force to move the throttle.

As the throttle opens to make it up the hill, manifold vacuum drops
anyway.  Many cars with factory cruise control use a small vacuum
reserve tank between the manifold and the cruise unit - adding a
check valve between the manifold and the reserve tank will help even
more.  You can make a tank out of any small cylinder, like an old
fire extinguisher or propane bottle - it only has to be proof against
about 30 PSI.  Or, get the reserve tank from an older American car
at a junk yard - Fords used tanks that looked exactly like big soup
cans, while GMs had round plastic balls with two vacuum fittings.  
Look on early-80s and older models; later models have electronic
cruise controls that are run by stepper motors that do not require
vacuum.
