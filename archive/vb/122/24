Subject: Re: [VB] VWOA Trademark Licensing Program

Ya, I really like their marketing plan, after a scorched earth campaign tell
the walking wounded that 'we really like you, but it was for your own good'
. Has anyone seen their new commercial where they tell you their always
trying to improve while they lean heavily on their aircooled past. The same
people who want their old cars to disappear so we can buy 'new' beetles.
Does anybody else think this is just their teaser for the 'new' bus.
