Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel pump question

I've only done this with a pump not installed on engine, but I think it should
work either way. Cover an fitting with your finger and operate the pump a few
times. Remove finger. If you here a little "pop" of vacuum being released, then
you have identified the inlet. No "pop"? Try the other fitting. Still no "pop"?
Pump is bad, probably the check valve flapper inside. Can't rebuild the
Brazilian pump to my knowledge. Old German two piece pump is a breeze to
rebuild, kit is readily available.
Instead of a finger you could attach some clear tubing to the fitting and drop
the other end of tubing into a can of gas. See gas being drawn up the tube?
That's the inlet.
I've never had to prime a pump, but I could just be lucky because I have heard
some references to it somewhere.
