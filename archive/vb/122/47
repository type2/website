Page 10 of the 1972 Without Guesswork manual at
http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/wog72/010_m.png
says that the pressure relief spring should be 44.1 mm long with a
5.6 to 7.3 kg load.  The presure control spring should be 20.2 mm
long with a 3.1 to 3.8 kg load.  The '72-up spec you quoted is for
the Type IV case.  Given these numbers, I think your relief spring
is too long.
