It's in a perpetual state of "almost done"  I haven't yet got 'round to
installing the westy top, and I have to jump thru a bunch of rigamarole to
get it licensed.  The nice lady (-at-) DMV told me I actually have to have to
arrange for CHP to come to my *house* for a VIN verification on it!

I submitted my plans and permit app for my new shop last week, so the trailer
is on the back burner for now.
