Subject: Re: [VB] Sway Bar Mounting

66 &67 buses came with front swap bars, think  the rubber bushing & clamps 
were the same as the later ones that you can order from a bunch of places.    
 I know you can retrofit the 66/67 bar on an earlier beam.  
bay window  211 411 309 A
splitty 211 411 309 
or heavy duty 18mm diameter for ambulances 271 411 309


yup- the later one camps with a bolt through the end, and the earlier with a 
clamp around the end (both are in addition to the big clamp with rubber 
bushing that are easily available) no idea if that clamp is available.  no 
hole on the earlier spindles for the later beam to bolt to.  its a lot like 
one of the muffler clamps that hold the tailpipe to a bracket.

Let the list know how it fits

<< I'm hoping someone can help me out a bit here...
 I want to put a sway bar on my 61 bus...original front beam.  I'd swap out
 to a later beam for bigger brakes and a bar...but I haven't found one around
 here just yet.
 I pulled a sway bar off of a 78 bus beam.  I've seen bay bars mounted to
 splits, the bar just hangs down lower.  Now, I don't remember what a sway
 bar mounted on a split looks like.  I have the clamps and rubber mounts for
 the bay bar, but I'm assuming I'll need to use the split rubber mounts and
 clamps, correct??
 The sway bar has a bolt hole on each and where it would bolt to the bay
 window beam.  I'm assuming by split beam doesn't have holes for these to
 bolt to, but on the split beam sway bars I seem to remember a clamp of some
 sort behind the large rubber mount/clamp setup.  Where can I get these?
 Will these work?  Does anyone have some they would part with?  I want to get
 this beam on before I leave for my trip to Topeka in a week.
 
 If anyone could give me some tips, that'd be great!
