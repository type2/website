My guess would be Walter Miller's http://www.autolit.com/.

Not the cheapest source in the world but lotsa selection.

I've heard about a website with tons of literature including early owners =
manuals, any one know where I can find it? or if you have a 57 owners =
manual I'd be happy to take it off your hands.
