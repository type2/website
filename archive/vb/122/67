   On removing the rear bumper of a 67 Sundial (probally the nicest OG
one I have ever seen) there was a bracket between the 8 mm bolt and the
little 4 mm bolt holding on the splash pans to the body. In all my years
of busdome this is the first time I have ever seen this little bracket.
Another thing that is there that I have never seen is a rubber drain
tube on the driver side battery? tray. Always learning new bits.

ps. This bus is in for an engine compartment detail, new engine and
trans.
