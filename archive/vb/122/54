The directions on their Web site are for the 681 model, which seems to
use a separate magnetic pickup instead of the points.  But most of the
wire colors seem to be the same:
 
>White wire from CDI to + on coil

OK

>Black wire from CDI to - on coil

The only black wires they talk about are grounds.  If this is a ground,
and it's connected to the other ground wire, then this could be the
problem.  Try disconnecting this wire altogether and see what happens.
 
>Red wire from CDI to a contact strip with: 12V from ign. on, 12V feed to
>electric fuel pump, idle cutoff valve and choke element

OK

>Green wire from CDI to points

OK.  The points should also probably still be connected to the -
terminal on the coil.

>Extra black wire with ring terminal from CDI to battery ground

Probably OK

The only wires you should have at the coil are the white wire from
the CDI (on +) and the wire to the points and the CDI (on -).
