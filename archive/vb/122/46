Check that the connections at the back of the gauge are clean and tight,
and the connection at the sender too if you can reach it.  But it's
probably the sender inside the tank.  It has a long coil of fine wire;
a moving arm attached to the float contacts different turns on the coil
to change the resistance to ground of the sender unit.  Probably the
coil of wire is broken and you get the bouncing needle when the moving
arm passes that broken spot.  You may be able to solder the wire, or
just replace the sender.

Good luck!
