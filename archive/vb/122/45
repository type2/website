Subject: RE: [VB] Need help with Tiger 581 CDI

Problem solved and boy do I feel like a dumb a$$.  I'm almost too
embarrassed to admit this but I had some of those plastic double female wire
connectors pulled from the dash area of a beetle.  I was using a couple of
them and just assumed that the conductors were separate through the
connector.  Well that wasn't the case and thus the points were getting +12V
which provided a short circuit to ground when they closed.  Fixed the
problem and the unit works great now:)
