mmmm,

For the 15" the European 185r15 gives you a nice sorta stockish
looking tyre with narrower width and taller
wall than the 205/75 15.  They're also just about the same rolling diameter
as the orig  5.40 15 crossply.....

Kumho have a great 185R15 available here in Oz (powermaster
or roadmaster? - I'd have to look).
Don't know about their availability in the US.
