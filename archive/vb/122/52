Hi Bart,
The only way to do it and not be on pins and needles while it is being
transported is to fly one way to Fresno and drive it back to Indiana.

cya,

I know this has been asked, but I am hoping for better prices.  I want to
ship a bus from Fresno, CA to Fort Wayne, IN w/o getting any dings or dents.
  Anyone know a good shipper or the going rate?
