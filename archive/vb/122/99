I have for TRADE a nice undented front clip from a clamshell-signalled
deluxe...66 I think. Dash is uncut too.  I would trade for a nice 77-79
westfalia campstool (veneer box with plaid cloth top).
If you know of a stool but don't want the clip, I'll pay good cashish for
the stool.  I know it's a bay part, but check your stashes and email me!
