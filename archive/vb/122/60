Subject: Re: [VB] Need help with Tiger 581 CDI

That sounds right, so obviously there must be a problrm somewhere.
The CDI in bypass should just short the correct terminals to make it as
oriiginal. Ive run the tiger with pertronix and points in bypass and
normal and never had it overheat anything, Mine is also grounded with the
black wire and screwed to the chassis. I suppose its always possible that
the cdi is funky. You can see my bad install pix at
www.type2.com/~andy
One other thing. The rotor has a resistor which will degrade it should be
bypassed or you can purchase a pre-done one from aircooled.net.
I did my own. You need a dremel, wire, soldering iron and some epoxy. not
a big job.
