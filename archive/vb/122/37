  What does this unit use as a road speed sensor?

I installed a VDO unit years ago on a 71 and it had two magnets that were mounted 180* apart on the inner CV and a transducer mounted on a bracket to read them.The throttle actuator was a nice strong electric motor and not vacume.

Seeing that he had sucessfully installed it into a 75 Bay window with FI (not sure if he has the 1.7, 1.8, or 2.0), I figured, I've been doing enough out of state driving, that I could benefit from something like this.
