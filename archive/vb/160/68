Yes.  The 6 V wiring handled up to 17 A or so with 6 V sealed-beams on
high beam.  Two 12 V 55 W high-beams will only draw around 10 A, or
over a third less than the originals.

You may want to go around and clean the connections on general principles.
A wire brush in a Dremel tool, or even one of those small wire brushes
that looks like a tooth brush, works very well.  Start by disconnecting
the battery negative strap and shining up its end and the place on the
body where it bolts.  Then tie it up where it can't flop back against the
body and go around the Bus, shining up anything that looks like an electrical
connection - unplug, wire brush both halves, replug.  I don't remember
offhand if your '61 has push-ons or screws.  If it has screws, you can
still undo the screws, shine up the wire end, put it back together, and
crank the screw down good.

If it uses push-ons, you will want to have a supply of replacement
push-ons on hand as well as a good pair of crimping pliers.  At least
one push-on will either break or fall off the wire when you pull it off
its connection.

The fuse panel has brass clips on the back for the fuses and push-ons
on the front, held together through the plastic by rivets.  You can
solder the clips and push-ons to the rivets to improve the contact.
 
If you have noticed your headlight switch getting warm to the touch,
you can do the same thing to it.
