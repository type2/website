Hi Jim,
Interesting to hear!  We have found quite a few of the splash pans with the 
bubble pressed in it for the longer MC.  We have seen ones cut out, but were 
not sure if this was stock for very late '66 and very early '67 or just a 
quick replacement by DPO or dealer by just taking an early pan and giving it 
a quick cut.  Are all of your '67s early models?
Thanks, Eric&Barb
