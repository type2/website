Well, Bart I am honored that you think enough of me (I mean my bus) to 
mention me  (it) in such high regard along with Chuck Notmeyer.  To confirm 
your observation, Sundials were made near Riverside (CA) in a community known 
then as Sunnymead, now known as Moreno Valley.  My best friend's brother 
worked there in the waning years of the company as a driver, so he was no 
help in qualified information regarding the camper as installed.  

Chuck Notmeyer is a wealth of information on Sundials, even knows where the 
former  Sundial factory owner lives, (hint: it is not in Southern California).
