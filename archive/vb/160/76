My '66 came with a peculiar step.  At first I thought it was homemade, but 
when looking at pics of Brad Millard's '66 I see the same step (Hot VW's Nov 
2001).  So I guess I should clean it up and put it back on.  But before I do 
here are some pics of the step.  I never took any when it was on the bus.

Anyone else ever seen this type of step before?  It has a spring on the 
hinge that keeps it folded up.
