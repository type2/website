Subject: sundial musings

In checking for sundial info, I re-read the type 2 library's interview with
the gent who used to work for sundial. Couple of things jumped out, he
mentioned the dealership was in Vancouver BC and they started in the early
70's. A big huh? I always thought they were a US company and started
producing in the early 60's. Can anybody shed some light. I've also got a
couple of brochures about the VW campmobile, these are the really cool ones
that show the tent on top of the roof rack, and one shows a camper with the
early type sundial windows as opposed to the jalousie westy windows. Ah the
esoterica with too much time on my hands.
