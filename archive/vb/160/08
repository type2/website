Subject: what tow hitch works?


I am looking for a tow hitch that works on a 60 doublecab.  How do these
mount to the bus and where are these available?  I want the best possible,
but it needs to be readily available.  I cannot hunt for 7 years for some
rare german NOS part at swap meets.  I need to get this ordered ASAP.
Thanks,
Jay
