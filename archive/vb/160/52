Guess I should be a little more detailed about the trans.
It is just the trans, no axles, and no nose cone.  It was first bought in
the late 90's, and installed into my 66 westy.  I was running warm, so after
a year of use, I put in a stock geared tranny, and that fixed the temp
problem.  I gave it to my Dad, as he was thinking of flipping the ring gear
over to run it in his Bug, but, the local speed limit where he lives is
55mph, and they're pretty strict, and therefore, it just doesnt seem worth
the install, especially since he needs to go through a canyon to get to
town.  It's been sitting in his garage ever since.

Anyway, he said he might have someone local to him that is interested in it,
but doesn't know what to get for it.  You know how it is, you dont want to
give stuff away, but at the same time, you don't want to rip anyone off
either.
