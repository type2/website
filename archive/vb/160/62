Subject: 66/ 68 brakes

I have just ordered an Oldspeed 944 brake kit (I am live in the UK but am
temporarily in Indiana so I thought I would save myself some shipping
charges!) to go on my 66 bus.  The brakes on my bus are okay, but my friend
also has a 66 fitted with a 68 balljoint beam.  
When I get back I need to help him fix his brakes and I was wondering anyone
knew if the brake parts are the same on a 68 or am I gonna have to get him
to order some new parts.  I know I could look in a catalogue - but being
away means I can't do that.
I know a couple of other people have fitted the Oldspeed kit, does anyone
know if it fits onto a 68 balljoint beam easily if I decide to do that next
year when the MOT test is due?

Thanks
Paul
