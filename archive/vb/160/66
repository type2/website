Subject: Re: [VB] anti-seize on lug nuts?

I use just a touch on the threads only.  I've had lugs
stuck so bad that I once actually drove a couple miles
(off-road) with a single bolt holding the wheel on,
trying to break it loose, to no avail.  

On the other hand, I have experienced a newly painted
wheel loosening up on the road.  I think the key is to
keep the "dish" (that the head seats into) clean, and
check tightness often (especially after painting
wheels).
