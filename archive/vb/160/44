Subject: new carb STILL won't start?


Well, I connected the shut-off limiter to the coil,
the engine STILL won't start. 

I checked the fuel pump, hand cranked the engine and
sucked some gas through the line to the carb (yum)
then reattached. Still wouldn't start.

I took the carb off and it was bone dry inside. Not a
drop anywhere.
I put the old carb back on, and it started in five
seconds. 

I called Wolfsburg and told 'em it was bone dry inside
and asked if the BROSOL has some internal cap or
something that I needed to take off before installing,
he said "nope". 
I triple-checked the connections, so, what the
dilly-yo?

I think I'm taking it to the shop tomorrow and letting
the mechanic install it. Unless someone has some other
advice?
