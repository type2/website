Subject: John Brown's Buses

Hi Folks,
All MD,VA, WV, DC Metro, and travelers are invited to John Brown's Buses on 
October 18-20 at the KOA in historic Harpers Ferry.  It should be beautiful 
fall weather and the colors of the leaves should be peaking.  There is much 
to do with the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers meeting here.  The Appalachian 
Trail and C&O canal are waiting for the outdoors people.  For the 
historians of the bunch, historic 'Lower Town' has much Civil war history 
and don't forget the armory that John Brown holed up in.  The rates will be 
roughly for two adults $25 a night for a primitive site and $28 and change 
for electric and water.  There is a loop that has roughly 5 of each that I 
would hope to get....  but I need some folks to commit.  Please come join 
us.  Trying to get an event going in our area.  E-mail me at
airhead(-at-)acvw.com to let me know if you plan to attend.  Could someone pass 
this on to the Vanagon list? Thanks

Joy Thru Air,
