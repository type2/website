Jason -
Antiseize WILL work, but only if it's applied in
extremely small amounts on threads of the lug
bolt. The biggest mistake that most people make
is that they put too much on (more is better,
right?). When tightening the bolt, the excess
goo squeezes out and gets on the lug bolt seat
(the part of the bolt that actually contacts the
wheel). A few miles down the road, wheel off
and big problems. This is IF you don't strip the
threads first due to overtightening. I avoid the
use of antiseize for all lug hardware. Clean the
threads of the bolt with a wire brush and the
conical seat on both the wheel and the bolt with
sandpaper, torque to spec (generally 75-80 ft.
lbs. for 5 lug VW's), and drive on with
no worries.
