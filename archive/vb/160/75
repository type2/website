Subject: Restoring front beam and greasing it!

First I will start with the greasing part as thats easy - when I grease
should I first be wiping off the excess grease that is pushed out of the
seal or should I wipe it off after filling them up?  I have a large build up
of grease and am not sure as to whether it should be there and I can't find
anything in any of the manuals to say whether I should wipe or not.

I am considering removing my front beam to restore it, as the floor above it
needs cleaning up as the cover plate is missing and if the beam is off then
it will make the job easier.
What is involved in restoring the beam, should I just sandblast it and get
it painted or powdercoated?  Are there any bushes that I should replace
whilst it is off?  Is there anything else I should consider replacing at the
front end whilst I do it?

Thanks
Paul
