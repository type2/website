Subject: RE: [VB] anti-seize on lug nuts?

Jason,
you're not the only one to experience this. I have been dealing with tight
lug bolts for over a year. I went through a batch of powder coated rims that
kept blowing out the valve stem and giving me flats. The lugs had to be
broken several times by the tire shop because I was twisting my X-wrench and
one time even snapped a Snap-on 17mm socket on my cheater bar. I got all
sorts of suggestions from the list, but nothing seems to work. I had ran a
fine stainless steel internal thread brush into the drum threads and also
cleaned all the lug bolts. I even put carbon grease on the threads and
checked them weekly for backing out. No such luck. The very next time I
changed a tire it was the same problem, they had tightened up again. Someone
told me they were sticking to the powder coating on the rims, but that
doesn't account for the factory painted rims.

I guess the only thing to say is to be happy yours and mine stay on. There
seems to be a large number of people on the list that have lost wheels from
Alaska to Atlanta and all points inbetween.

I took a wheel off three days ago. I had to stand on
the "X" lug wrench, bruised my shin. Put it back on
the next day. Had to take it off again the following
day and it was equally hard to remove (more shin
bruises).

Is it okay to put anti-seize on the lug nuts? With all
this recent talk of wheels falling off, I'm just
wondering.
