Is this the cloth covered stuff? Why do you have to use this on a VW? What is so special about it?

Get four inches of the neoprene/webbed VW flexible black gas line (you
can buy this at any decent VW parts outlet),

While you're at it, replace all your existing rubber gas line segments
with the VW gas line too, and use the small adjustable stainless steel
hose clamps at each end everywhere.
