Actually, if you want 15"x5.5" you can have them made for you, provided 
you have a friendly tire shop who can perform the work. Generally any 
shop that does straightening and rim repair should be able to help you. 
You can find junkyard or use 15" rims with a 5.5" width, and have your 
bus centers cut out and welded onto the new rims. This is one way to 
recycle old bus rims that are bent; as long as the centers are 
straight, they will be perfect. Of course, this will only work with 
steel wheels, and you do need to find exactly the right size donor rims 
to work. You will want to work closely with the shop doing the work to 
make sure they get the offset right.

The previous owner of my last bus had gone this route, and the bus had 
14"x6" on the front, and 15"x7" on the back, but from the side the rims 
looked totally stock. The bus was lowered, with the reduction boxes 
removed, and changing a rear tire with the 7" rims was a painful 
process..... There was very little clearance on the sides with the 
wider tires! If you just go up to 5.5", you shouldn't run into near as 
much trouble, and you will have a bit more selection when you go to buy 
your next set of tires!
