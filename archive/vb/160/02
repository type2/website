 Has anyone ever applied epoxy primer over por-15 without the use of the tye coat primer?  I suspect it would work very well - but I dunno.

Yup, you won't have any problems, but you must apply it at the 2-3 hour
point, when the POR is slightly tacky, before it fully cures (4+ hours).
Apply a very light coat, and let the POR finish drying, then build up the
rest of your primer coat.
