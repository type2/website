Hi Paul,
There should be a couple of tabs spot welded to the underside of the shelf 
the fuel tank sits on.  These tabs hold the fuel line from laying down on the 
tranny and control cables which can saw through the fuel line.

This anti-vibration bracket and the tabs under the gas tank shelf must have 
sections of fuel line slit lengthwise around the metal fuel lines to prevent 
any metal to metal contact!!!!
