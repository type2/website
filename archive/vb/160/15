steve asked why cloth covered?

I think the reason you want to use cloth covered is in the event that the
fuel line begins to leak the fuel line will kind of absorb the fuel, instead
of it dripping  all over the place. so you could potentially smell it, then
by feeling the fuel line discover where the leak is.

kind of makes sense to me.
