Subject: Re: [VB] 6v wiring and Halogens?

12v uses half the current (amps) as 6v so with old 35 watt??? head 
lights current will not be a problem.  BUT the connections (meaning the 
connection points) on 40 year old anything need cleaning and reworked.
P & C

 Can the original 6v wiring handle 12v Halogen H4 50/55W headlights?
