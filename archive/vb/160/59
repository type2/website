You connected it to the positive side of the coil - the same terminal
with the wire that comes out of the engine harness, right?  This is
muy importante.  If you connect it to the same terminal as the wire
from the distributor it won't work.

If it's still off, hold it upright and blow into the tube where the
fuel line attaches.  You should be able to do this easily and hear
the air going into the bowl.  If it's like blowing into a bottle and
you don't hear air inside the carb, the float valve (the brass thing
in the ceiling of the float bowl, you have to take the top off to
see it) is screwed up.  Either it's stuck shut (unlikely on a new carb)
or the washers under it are too thick and not allowing it to open.
Carb rebuild kits have washers of various thicknesses for putting
under the float valve.
