Subject: Lug nuts - the FINAL word

Well, since I'm the one who posted it, I have been
reading every lug nut method, and my consensus is:

1) NOTHING on the wedged recess surface of the rim
hole (the part the angled part of the bolt head snugs
into). Thick paint or powder coat MIGHT chip away,
leaving that bolt suddenly "loose".

2) CONSISTENT or UNIFORM torque of the nuts, be it by
torque wrench, grunt, weight, whatever. All the same
torque means they are equally working to hold the rim
on, no slackers to get loosey-goosey.

3) Anti-seize? Has been used successfully. But if so,
use in moderation. VERY slight on the threads.

That's it, based on the replies. Oh yeah...

4)After installing wheels, it's good to check them
after a few miles. Better safe than sorry!

Good night.
