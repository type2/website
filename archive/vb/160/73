Hi Jason,
Like Matt says" Can you blow through it?", if not remove the shut off valve 
and check that the passage to the valve was drilled through at the factory.  
If it was try a differant shut off valve, and yes the thickness of the gasket 
for it and the hieght of the shut off float are important to wether the shut 
off valve gets to open or even close properly.
