Subject: Re: [VB] sundial musings

Chuck,
   I have been tracking sundial's for some time now and every "actual" 
sundial I have came across is from CA.  The earliest I have seen is a '63.  
The earlier Sundial were mostly made from panel's and later kombi's were 
used.  I think some of the best examples of later sundials would Chuck 
Notmeyer's and Mike Alcorn's 67's.  I have gotten many an email from people 
stating/questioning if their camper is a "sundial".  To the 
not-so-knowledgable person a Sundial is any US camper conversion.  To my 
knowledge I have not found a Bay window w/ a sundial kit in it.  I too 
question the validity of that interview.  My latest sundial email was from a 
guy in NY, he bought my X-L-O mirrors.  After some questioning, he aquired 
his sundial from CA.  I need to start keeping track of M-codes, for I think 
that all or most sundials will have an origon of the port of Los Angeles.
