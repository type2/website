Hi Jay,
We have been able to find on occasion VOA models of these hitches at the swap 
meets for hundred or less dollars.  These will easily tow a bug/KG.  You 
actually have to keep reminding yourself over and over so as to not go too 
fast into a sharp curve, downhill or corner.  We even have towed a split 
screen behind our split screen, but found it too hairy due to too close of 
wieght ratio between the two.
