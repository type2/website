I responded to several people with photos of my '67 splash pan.  Those
photos are from a bus very late (June 67) in the 1967 model year.  This
was clearly stamped that way and not modified later.  That's the only
one I know came on a specific bus.

I found I also had two cut out, obviously by hand, but it was in my
pile of parts with several other pans and not on a vehicle, so I could
not identify it as early or late '67.  I haven't crawled under my other
late (also June 67) bus to look at the pan.  My third '67 is a single
circuit early of early '67 model year (July 66) and therefore would not
require the cut-out.

The larger bubble is a new one to me.  It strikes (pardon the pun) me
as odd that they would modify the die for the press to shape it
differently.  The cut-out is a cheaper solution.  Any one with a photo
of this larger bubble configuration?
