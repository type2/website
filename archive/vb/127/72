Subject: Re: [VB] Wood slats on every row???

Rex,
Sorry, can't help with a pic, but 3 listee's DC's were  
were parked cheek to jowl at the Classic yesterday, 
Steve Harris, Todd Priggmore and I. Steve needs a set 
for his. More slats would help when setting down a beer 
bottle or coffee cup! 

My 3 year old slats are gray and warped, I used indoor 
urethane instead of marine varnish/urethane and it's 
pretty much all gone. The truck is always parked outside 
too. I can sand 'em down to the pretty wood and varnish 
again, but...
I was wondering if anyone has considered synthetic slats 
as in the new decking material made from recylcled 
plastic? I just looked at a Google search for recycled 
decking and found a bunch of sources. There's a few 
choices of color and uses the same tools and fasteners 
as wood. Guess I could get dimensions and have some 
milled. Anybody interested in a set?
