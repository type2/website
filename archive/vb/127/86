Subject: Re: [VB] Why do I have no spark?

Hi Jason,
Best way to figure it out is to start at the coil and work your way to the 
sparkplugs.  Check for electricity and amount going to the #15 (+) side of 
the coil.  If no or too low of voltage check up the wiring from the from and 
back the battery.  Once you have the voltage to the coil check if you can get 
spark to the plugs.  If not you will need to check the coil by grounding the 
#1 (-) terminal on it and then disconnect the ground to see if you get spark 
at a plug.  If you get spark by grounding the #1 terminal then and not hooked 
to the condensor then you might have a bad condensor.  Try replacing the 
spark wire between the coil and distributor.  Also check distributor cap for 
cracks and that the carbon brush in the center is there and in good 
condition.  Eric's dad was given a non-running car once.  After only five 
minutes he got it running by replacing the distributor cap brush!  DPO was 
POed!  :-)
