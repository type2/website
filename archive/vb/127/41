Okay, I took the maiden voyage today with the slam-o-matic and came to
the realization that my stock KYB shocks were bottomed out completely
and my suspension consisted primarily of tire.
 
Sooo, I bought some Empi (sic) "short shocks" that are used for bugs,
typ3's, etc. this afternoon and figured they would do just the thing.
Got home and put them on to find out that they had about 1/2" or less of
travel before they too would bottom out.
 
Anyone out there have any suggestions? The rear suspension is '68 IRS,
so I only have about 6-7" between the shock points. Has anyone had to
get custom shocks or something for another vehicle? Not too many FLAPS
in this area to ask about this...
 
Thanks,

'60 DD Panel - bottomed out, but no longer "smearing" oil...
