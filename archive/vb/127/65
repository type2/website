Subject: 67 wires woes?

Hello all,
 The other day while traveling home the 67 bus just sorta died. we were
driving and it just lost power like it had no electricity to the motor and
then had smoke coming out the rear of the bus. we look it over and see no
sign of anything burnt ,so we throw a fresh battery in it and it wont turn
over when you hit the ignition, no click , nothing. The volt-o-meter says
8volts from the power to the coil. all fuses are good.
Ignition?
I still have to crawl under and test the voltage to the starter from the
ignition.
any help appreciated.
Thanks,
 Bryan
