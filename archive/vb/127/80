Subject: Thumper fer sale

A lot of people have been asking for pics of my SC for sale from dropgates,
SV2, and here, so I added another page to my still in work trike page and
posted the most recent shots there.

It is very slow loading, please be patient:

Oh, and the gentleman from Texarkana, please send me your snail mail address
so I can mail out the pages from the manual on how to adjust your rear
torsion bars. I also have the tools, homemade, but very similar to the pics.
Thanks.
