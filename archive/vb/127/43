Hi All from the Crowne Plaza Irvine...

The tipper made it smoothly down here to LA... all 1000 miles.  Two small
little issues; a broken carb return spring (easily fixed) and a stuck #4
exhaust valve which was fixed on the side of the road in a few minutes...
but these items happened before I really got out of Boise where I meet three
busses from the Bus Pilots club so the whole trip went quite well.

Octo today was great.  Saw many people and the tipper got an award for best
un-restored special interest commercial or something like that... I was over
gabbing with Greg Noble when they announced it so I'm still not quite sure.
Robert Davis was there with his Westy and got best restored camper I
believe.  Richard Barker was there lowered down and doing well, Ronnie with
the fugly double cab... and of course many others.  Great show and thanks to
all in the octo club.

Tomorrow, the classic and then the journey back home.


Take care all.


David
