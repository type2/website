Subject: Wood slats on every row???

I know the wood slats in a single cab were on every other row of the ribs. 
Was wondering if anyone has installed them on every row and if they've got 
a picture. I'm curious how it looks.

I know I'd have to put more holes in the bed if I do this, but just 
checking into all the options. Seems like more wood slats would help 
protect the metal bed. Just an idea.
