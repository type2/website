Split SO-42's did not have a breaker.  I think that started with the 68
models I think it was located on the jump seat behind the driver
somewhere.  

Fairly simple but a bit involved to replace as the wire is run behind
the birch paneling along the drivers side.  If you have a early 66 back
to a late 64 SO42/44 then the 110v wire bundle runs back to the left
rear corner of the bus.  If you have a mid to end of prod. 67 then the
socket is mounted to the drivers side of the bus just above the rocker.
