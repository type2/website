If your bus has rust there (nah couldn't be) the jack point will mush up and be a PITA.  safety!!!!  My 61 15 window has this issue, I have a cheap floor jack that lives under the bed in the back of the bus.    You might get one, useful if you need to swap a motor on the road anyway. Or help someone else.
   I put the jack under the front BEAM.  have a 4x4 handy, and set that just behind the swing lever, you can jack up the whole front end at a time- useful for adjusting brakes, greasing beam, etc.   In the back I put it under the U channel.   Can jack at one side if you just want one wheel of the ground.  As I have 15" wheels I need that 4x4 chunk or the jack doesn't lift the bus high enough.  keep a piece of plywood in there big enough to set the jack on in case you need to use it on soft or uneven ground.
