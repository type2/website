Subject: Correction: I need a straight lower torsion ARM <sorry> for 65

Hi,

Context: I am putting on the rebuilt king pin assemblies. My passenger 
side offset is 5mm (or less). I swapped lower torsion arms (thanks to 
the list for that suggestion), and the good offset followed the driver 
side torsion arm, the bad followed the passenger side torsion arm.

I need a straight "Torsion Arm, lower 211 405 153 A" and wanted to know 
if anyone on the list had one before I had to order four from Bus Boys.

Thanks,
Conrad
