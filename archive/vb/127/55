I wouldn't say a 58-67 parts list, rather that one is the 63 edition updated 
through 67 (or whenever). It'd be current for what was AVAILABLE in 67 (or 
whenever it was updated through).  or maybe it's a 68 edition of the splitty 
list updated through 70. (They printed a separate list for bay parts.)   It 
would have older than 58 parts in it, though not as complete for the older 
buses.   For example, you could still get new 25 hp heads in 1971 at the 
dealer,  for an older than 58 bus.   Every so often (2-3 years I think) they 
came out with a new list, then for a few years sent  updates to the 
dealerships (look for date on bottom of page in the supercessions).   Then a 
few years later they'd print a more current list, with some parts deleted 
(NLA), some superceded, and new parts added.  Each year (I think) the 
dealerships would get a price list.  I hope that makes sense.  It does have a 
different meaning than a '58-67 list.'    And it's explains why there are 
different things in different lists.

Maybe this is boring, but it is helpful when I'm trying to find how to 
identify the appropriate part for my bus, and not end up with a different 
version of it.

 The online '58-'67 parts list has the supercessions; look for the
 "Supplement" pages in the very first section.  Note that the 
 supercessions will only be the ones that happened since the printing
 of the parts list.
 
 I don't think the '50-'54 has any supercessions, but I don't think they
 had superseded any parts yet, either.
