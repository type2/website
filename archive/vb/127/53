Subject: overhead fresh air vent control shaft knob position?

Bus Friends,

  I seem to remember somebody asking this question, but when I searched
the archives, I could not find the answer.

  The overhead vent control arm (in the cab, drivers right hand reachs up
and grabs it) that move the flap up and down.  This control knob is held
on by the same mechanism that the valves are adjusted (slotted bolt with a
locking nut.)  The control knob turns a round shaft has with two flat
spots where the slotted bolt hold the flap.  I can only get to the flat
spots - if the control knob hangs down, and not up on the side where it
should be.  What am i doing wrong?

Best,
joe
