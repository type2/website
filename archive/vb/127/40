Subject: FS: (1) rear slash bumper deluxe trim (slash style)

Hi,

I've been going through my 'junk' today and reminded myself that I had a 
rear slash bumper deluxe trim - its slash style, not a pointed trim 
piece. I've never seen one for sale, and thought I'd offer it to someone 
on the list who needs it to finish their project.

Let me know if you need one for your project, I'll send a pic and we can 
negotiate. And yes, I'd rather sell to someone who needs to finish their 
project. (And no I don't have two.)

Thanks,
Conrad
