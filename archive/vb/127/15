Okay, run a wire from the 30 terminal of the starter (where the wire to the ig switch goes- push on terminal) and bring it through into the engione compartment- make it long enough to reach the + terminal of the battery. Use thick red wire. PLug a black wire onto coil 15 terminal and put an alligator on the other end, wire must be long enough to reach the + terminal of the battery.  when you clip that onto the battery you have juice to the coil, even though the lights up front are off.  Make sure it's out of gear, and touch (don't clip or permanently attach) the fat red wire from the starter to the + of the battery.  No, it doesn't shock you.   the starter should turn, the engine should catch, and voila.      To shut of the motor, unclip the alligator from the coil to the battery.

If you find a bell housing from a tranny you can bolt a starter (with appropriate starter bushing) to it, and bolt that to a engine out of a bus to start it.  you'ld need a battery and some wire, and a can of gas.  can also be used to test starters (use appropriate bushing- starter is supported- voila!)

Anyway, I put the engine in the 66 to test it but can't seem to figure out how I can start it up. There is no key, no ignition switch, and the wiring up front in the cab is a spagetti twisted mess. The engine has an alternator conversion with built in regulator. Is there a way I can wire the battery directly to the starter or alternator just to get the engine started
