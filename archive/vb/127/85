Dan just left us here in Ventura with a little more info on the route up
north, AIRS contacts and parts/shops in the San Francisco Bay area.

He is headed north a little further tonight until he gets tired (Matt is
bedded down in the rear seat) and will stop then.  Keep an eye out for him
if you are traveling up 101.  Looks like he is going to take it clear up
to Oregon.
