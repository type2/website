Most of them are in my underground bunker.  I found that by creating a 58=

degree F, 75% humidity compartment where the seats are misted with glycer=

twice per day, the original upholstery returns to like-new condition with=
in

If you wish to see the results, I will have a 1957 Microbus seat, green
in color, available for viewing at this Saturday's NEATO/OCTO meet in Sou=

are clean and disease-free.  Medical records required.
