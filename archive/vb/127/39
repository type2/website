That's what I was thinking.  As far as I can tell I have the original
transmission, but I realize the clutch arm is very easy to change
independent of the entire transmission.

I'll see how well I can fake it first.  If I take the engine out, then
I will decide that it's a good time to fix the leaky pushrod seals.  When
I take the heads off to do that, I will see the inside of the cylinders
and probably decide it's rebuild time, and I can't ju$tify the part$ for
a really good rebuild right now.  :)

>Are you using the straight or curved arm?

Straight.

>Was the cut through the boden tube on which side of the tube?

The cut was on the top side - closest to the floor of the Bus.  Almost
as if the clutch arm is too tall (too long).
