This was passed onto me:

Multipass Method for evaluating filtration Performance
Issuing Committee: Filter Test Methods Standards Committee
Scope:
This standard establishes a multipass filtration performance test with
continuous contaminant injection for lubricating oil filter elements. It
also includes a procedure for determining the contaminant capacity,
particulate removal characteristics, and pressure loss. It also includes a
test currently applicable to lubricating oil filter elements which exhibit a
10 um filtration ratio of less than 75 and a rated flow between 4 and 600
L/min. This standard provides a test procedure which yields reproducible
test data for evaluating the filtration performance of a lubricating oil
filter element.
Here are the filters results:
Mobil 1: Single pass efficiency (SAE J806) of 98% vs. an 85% average for
conventional filters. * Multiple pass efficiency (SAE J806) of 95% vs. an
80% average for conventional filters.
Pure One: Single Pass Test efficiency for the PureONE filter is 99.7%. Pure
One captures 96% of all contaminants as measured by the Society of
Automotive Engineers' (SAE) #J806 Multiple Pass Test. *
An article that I read in Grassroots Motorsports several years ago stated
that the Wix filter had ~495 sq. in. of filter media, the regular Purolator
had ~ 450 sq. in. and the Fram had ~200 sq. in. Needless to say, I haven't
used a Fram on anything since. They're cheap, but you get what you pay for.
I used Wix and Purolator for a long time but now use Pure One filters on all
my vehicles.
