There was a oil filter report on the net about a year ago. This guy took
every known filter available , cut it open and inspected them for quality.
His site got shut down by the big filter makers for saying the truth.
His results were unbiased. NAPA gold filters one of the best along with MANN
(germany). I use MANN filters and have never had one blow or leak. BOSCH
wasn't on his list so there are no test results. I will post this to the
other list to see if anybody saved his site. There is still a link to it in
a round about way to avoid more lawsuits.

ps. The mann filter I use has an internal bypass pressure release so it will
bypass the filter part under extreme pressures

Well, let me say this, on that: 


I know Dan Kinsey to be one of the most meticulous (sp) people I know, and
I'll bet he installed it right the first time. But, when he started the Binz
up at 4 AM in front of my house, in our warm tropical climate, and started
to drive away, he left a trail of oil 2-3 inches wide! Lou called him back
on the two-way radio, and he pulled the FRAM filter off, and about an inch
of the sealing gasket was crimped over, or destroyed, or wasn't there,
whatever. 


I have heard, many times on our lists that Fram filters are cr*p, and other
name brand ones because they are made by the same cheap standards. Sure Fram
filters are cheap to buy, and easy to find, but I think that's part of the
problem. We keep buying the cheap ones, so they are plentiful, but we have
to hunt down the good ones, such as the Bosch, and maybe pay a little more.
But in the long run, which is the bargain: the cheap one that potentially
could have destroyed Dan's engine, or .... 


In my case, I bought a case of Bosch from Bus Depot 'when they were on
sale,' so I had extras on hand when Dan needed one. 


We put good oil in our engines because we know what's best for them,
maintenance-wise, but does it make sense to skimp on the filter? You
decide...

Is this yet another negative testamonial for Fram oil filters?

oil that his filter had spit out! The Fram's gasket had crimped, and he 

was pouring out oil! Fortunately I had a Bosch oil filter, (Thanks Bus 

Depot!) Dan installed it, with a quart of Valvoline (thanks Lou) and 

they were on their way.
