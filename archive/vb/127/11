How long is a string?  It was safe when it rolled out of the Westfalia
factory, but that was 30+ years ago.  If the wire insulation isn't
rubbed through, and the sockets still hold plugs tightly, then it's
probably fine.  The 120V wiring is totally isolated from the 12V wiring,
except for the ground connection - when you're plugged into city power,
the metal of the entire Bus is grounded.  This is a Good Thing.

The '78 Westy wiring diagram online shows a 15 A circuit breaker on
the 120V wiring.  I don't know if yours has a fuse or a breaker but
if you're really worried about it you could add one.  It would need
to go in the black wire between the outside plug and the sockets
inside.  A GFCI outlet between the outside plug and the inside
sockets would provide extra safety, or just use an extension cord
with a GFCI built into the end to power the outside plug.

>how easy is it to replace?

No idea.  In general, if you can't see the whole wire, you need to
use the old wire to pull the new wire in.
