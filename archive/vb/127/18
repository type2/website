Subject: Re: [VB] Big Dents A Better Mouse Trap (DC)

Sounds like this is not any easier, just less use of the arm muscles. And,
of course, not every one has a power ram.

I hammered out the ribs first since these are the areas that were subject to
the most damage from the stuff being tossed in the bed. Hammering on the
ribs pulled the flat areas up at the same time. I only had to hit the flat
areas on the parts of the bed that were seriously bowed.

How do you get to the areas over the wheel wells and over the beams running
lengthwise under the bed with your power ram?
