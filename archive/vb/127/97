Subject: RE: [VB] re:t+45... stuck valve

is answered:
When the valve stuck, I basically felt a loss of power since it was then
only running on 3 cylinders and I drove it that way for another 100 miles or
so.(!)  To fix it, the rocker was removed and the valve tapped slightly with
the end of a screw driver and it popped back out.  Bolted it back together
and away I went. Thanks to Lind Bjornsen for the diagnosis and quick fix.

I have an email in to the guy that built the motor to find out if he has an
explanation of why this happened.... It ran beautifully the rest of the 1800
miles down and back on my trip to the classic.

was writ
"a stuck #4 exhaust valve which was fixed on the side of the road in a few
minutes..."

was asked:
just out of curiousity-what exactly are the symptoms of a stuck exhaust
valve-and how do you fix it?
