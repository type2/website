Subject: RE: Wood Slats

I used Marine Spar on my wood slats in the 1960DC -- bought it at Home
Depot--But ask at a real good wood boat shop for the best wood
protector--Wood slats I bought at Home depot also -- went with Oak--

But I cannot remember when the last time it rained in AridZona--all I do
know is that after months in the weather the wood slats looked as new in the
DC--
