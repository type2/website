The '67 parts manual, online at
http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part.html ,
lists 513 C, 513 D, and 513 E part numbers.  The E part is listed
for every application from 1962 through 1967 models.  The C part
is listed for 1962 through 1965 models, and the D part is listed
for 1966 and 1967 models.

From this, I would say that it is for a '65 or older Bus.  The B
part could have been used on something before '62, or it could
have been used on the '62-'67 models and been superceded by the
C part.  The 041 means the housing is black.

I hope this helps!
