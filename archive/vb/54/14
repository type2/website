Subject: 62' bus question

Hi everyone, 
  I am new to this list.  I am considering buying a
'62 bus and would like some advice as to wether or not
the $1200 asking price is reasonable. Here's what I
know;

  '62, from Georgia, not licensed for 15+ years
   Body solid underneath, all the window rubber is
shot so there is damage to the bottoms of the
passenger side doors and cargo floor from water
collecting, plenty of surface rust- rot only in door
bottoms as mentioned above - rear wheel wells cut for
larger tires( includes repair panels)
  Has good running 1600 DP, runs and drives nice, no
shifting problems- exhaust shot
  Converted to 12V somewhere in it's history
  no- bumpers
  has flip-up hatch type sunroof- NO POP-TOP
  Interior has been stripped of all fabric, including
headliner, rear "camper" cabinets and ice chest remain
and are in fair shape.  Front seats ok too
  All side windows are pop-out type.  
  Overall intact, all necesary parts (lights mirrors
etc are there. 
 15" wheels w/ spare 
 Includes paperwork to register

Any advice or ideas are appreciated.  I haven't found
too many in this condition to make a fair comparison. 
The plan is for a daily driver, not a show bus.

Matt
