Hi Clara,
I've worried about the same thing. Especially since Ronnie's solid POR
floor Porsche 356 story.
For solid places that won't flex it sounds like Corroless may do well.
It makes sort of a glass crystalline structure as I recall. On parts that
are thin sheet metal that are subject to flexing it may not be good.
I have used POR on beams, axles, and windshields under the gaskets.
Haven't seen any rust yet.
Either product is pretty thick stuff I think. I'm leaning towards
Corroless for my front floors and drip rails.  Any users of both have
opinions?
