Subject: Re: [VB] Garage/Shop suggestions

Jim, these are all REALLY GREAT suggestions:  high ceiling, insulation,
attic or upper floor, room around vehicle.

Steve, depending on where you live, the most building you can buy for the
least money are metal "pole barns".  These things go up in days, not weeks,
last a life time, no siding or shingles to worry about.  Around here, the
lightning won't hurt them, neither will the termites!!

I've got THREE 30x50 metal buildings for the price of what ONE stick built
building would cost.  One of my barns has 16' walls so I have a full
upstairs storage area that is great.  The other two have 12' ceilings so I
can work on tractors and tall trailers.  The tall ceilings are great for
hanging cool stuff too.
