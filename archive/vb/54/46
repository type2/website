Hi Joel,
Remove the sender and adapter and go out and buy a matching threaded tapered 
tap.  Then apply grease in each of the flutes of the tap to catch most of the 
aluminum/mag alloy chips.  Remember as always when threading for every one 
turn in, then half a turn back to break the chips into short pieces that will 
not bind up so easily the tap/die used!  After you have created new threads 
use a Q-tip to dab up any remaining greasy chips in the threaded hole and fit 
the adapter back in the hole.  If the adapter or oil sender seats flush 
against the case you need to file off enough surface material to allow at 
least 1/16" space between the case and the adpater or oil pressure sender 
body.  Be very carefull not to split the case by tightening the 
sender/adapter too far in!  We use teflon tape on these threads to help seal 
with less tighening!  Eric&Barb
