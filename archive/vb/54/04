I have a 28 PCI that I'd like to put in my bus.  I found it and bought a =
rebuild kit and rebuilt it so I'd like to use it while I'm rebuilding my =
28 PICT.  Problem is my PICT has a hole for the vacuum advance hose but =
the PCI doesn't.  What kind of distributor went with the PCI?  If I were =
to just use, say, a 009 distributor would that solve my problem?  I =
think my current distributor is from a 74 super beetle. =20

I like the idea of a manual choke and I think I read in the Idiot book =
that St. Muir used a 28 PCI with different jets in his early bus - =
that's what I want to try.

Also, the spacer thing that goes under my 28 PICT seems too high.  My =
oil bath air cleaner hits the top of my engine bay.  If that was, say, =
1/4" shorter life would be simpler.  Were these things all one size?  =
Could I just get mine cut down a little bit at a machine shop? =20
