Subject: Re: [VB] westfalia curtin rods

The Westfailure is a 67, and a walkthru. It has both the tracks on the sides
and windshields, as well as the cab partition track. It ends at the fresh
air vent on each side. There is no sign of a fastening device for the area
under the vent, so I assume the curtains dead ended there. It was an SO-42.
