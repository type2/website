Subject: Re: [VB] 62' bus question

$1200 sounds like a reasonable price to me for a readily restorable
and largely complete bus, others may disagree. I think I have many of
the same issues on a '67 that recently came my way. I have been
pricing and buying parts, here's some of the numbers I have run into:
Cargo floor repair sections, maybe 10" by about 5', $40/each
(Also available are larger pieces and pieces which include rocker, at
higher cost)
Front footwell repair sections, approximately outer 1/3 of floor,
$40/each
All new rubber door and window seals, I think around $400 for a Kombi,
obviously many window deluxe will run more, panel will run less
Original bumpers I have seen at swaps are typically pretty beat, good
ones are pricey, repops are available in both metal and fiberglass
Proper bus muffler is maybe $150, extractors are less but not the
right choice for every application despite what the soup-it-up boys at
the bugshop might tell you.
Upholstery and interior panels are available, I re-padded and
re-upholstered the front bench for less than $200, TMI Products, not
quite show-winning quality but I am pleased and it does a fine job of
keeping the springs out of my ass...
A couple of listees, Ronnie of type2parts.com and Ron of busdepot.com
have websites which should give you an idea of what new parts are
available.
Many volks on the list are also real good about helping others out
with used parts they may have stashed away, you are probably going to
need some things that are just not available new.
I would suggest you hold on to as many of the original parts as you
have and work towards rebuilding them, much of the new stuff just
isn't up to the quality of the old, a lot of new parts need trimming
and grinding and cursing to fit right, it is distressing to have to do
this to shiny new stuff you just spent a bunch of money on.
Good luck, go bus.

Hi everyone,
  I am new to this list.  I am considering buying a
'62 bus and would like some advice as to wether or not
the $1200 asking price is reasonable. Here's what I
know;

  '62, from Georgia, not licensed for 15+ years
   Body solid underneath, all the window rubber is
shot so there is damage to the bottoms of the
passenger side doors and cargo floor from water
collecting, plenty of surface rust- rot only in door
bottoms as mentioned above - rear wheel wells cut for
larger tires( includes repair panels)
  Has good running 1600 DP, runs and drives nice, no
shifting problems- exhaust shot
  Converted to 12V somewhere in it's history
  no- bumpers
  has flip-up hatch type sunroof- NO POP-TOP
  Interior has been stripped of all fabric, including
headliner, rear "camper" cabinets and ice chest remain
and are in fair shape.  Front seats ok too
  All side windows are pop-out type.
  Overall intact, all necesary parts (lights mirrors
etc are there.
 15" wheels w/ spare
 Includes paperwork to register

Any advice or ideas are appreciated.  I haven't found
too many in this condition to make a fair comparison.
The plan is for a daily driver, not a show bus.

Matt
