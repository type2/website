Subject: Re: [VB] drafty front floor  :(

I have found it to be more effective when used with their metal ready. you
don't have to get all the rust off, but you need to scrape off the big
chunks and get down to the root of it. I cleaned my floor with a wire bush,
used meatal ready and por 15 silver and haven't seen any advance in rust.
best of all the silver actually ads strength to whats left. I didn't scrape
down or use metal ready in the belly box and it didn't bond well.
