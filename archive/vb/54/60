Visited a local old timer who used to work for VW today. I went ahead and
bought a box of NOS overhead vent direction knobs. They are white. If
anyone needs one I'll sell 'em for $1 a piece. I mainly just bought them
because they were vintagebus and they were there. I don't really need them.
So buy one if you want. There's about 25 or so.

Also bought a few VW tools. Bought a real VW head assembly tool. Also
bought a VW 267 tool. He told me it was for working with tie-rods. Any info
on it would be appreciated.

Off Topic: I saw a couple of interesting looking window cranks (I'm
assuming that's what they were) They were black with a white knob and had
the number 113 881 565 on them. So I guess that means they're bug ones...or
Ghia or something. Anyone know what they go to buy using that number? They
are NOS. I didn't get them...but probably could if someone wanted. Let me
know what they are.

Getting a little bit here and there!
