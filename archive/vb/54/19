Carl,
first off, if you don't want to cut and hack and have about 4-6 inches hanging
out the rear of your bus, upright conversion is needed.  I converted my '60 DC
with cutting a single piece of metal.  Could go back to stock in a couple of
heartbeats.

check out my pages

be sure and scroll around all over the place through all my pages.
Then, bring on the questions.
Scott
