Subject: Re: [VB] westfalia curtin rods

I have the sliding tracks around my windshield on my '66 SO 42. I found some
plastic fittings and corresponding tape that snap into the fittings and my
wife used these for curtains to wrap around the inside of the windshield and
meet at the center. My westy also has plastic straps with snaps on the end
to hold the curtains open behind the front seats so that they don't
interfere with getting in and out of the cab. My camper is a walk-through
and I don't have a curtain rod that goes between the cab and the rear area.

Clara has got me there. My westy has these sliding tracks too- I didn't
bother to count these as they are pop rivetted to the inside of the cab and
are therefore rarely removed.

 i did the mental math and came up with 8- one for each of the six window

and two for the back window. as menioned westy's came with an (optional?)
cab
divider curtain rod that follows the curved profile of the cab. you tend to
see these more on early 60's westy's and by the time they got to so 42's
they
petered out

some westys came with the sliding curtain track around the windsheilds and
front door windows.  My 65 has it.
