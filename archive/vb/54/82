Subject: Re: [VB] drafty front floor  :(

I have heard diff things about POR 15, some people say you have to get all 
the rust off before you use it or it'll just rust away under the POR 15, 
others say you can just cover it up.  What should I believe? It is impossible 
to get anything dry in W Wa this time of year if that matters.   I guess I 
could light a campstove under it if need be.   This bus also has rust in 
various places, like inside the bus at the rail the headliner tucks into, 
that lip the condensation has been dripping into for 30ish years... that it 
would be hard to get the rust out of.  

Anyone have a really nice side panel behind the cargo doors for a 61?   It 
needs that replaced too.  And one OG 15" trim ring?

Still,  bus made it to Red Barn/Kelley Park in the spring, in spite of its 
lack of shininess.

 im just doin my 1960 mcrobus, i dont want it to be a show winner but at
 least keep rust away.
 
 As im not as equipped as other, where i cant get sandblasted, i clean and
 apply POR15, as i did for my front floor, i cut the rustes through, i clean
 the rest of the front floor and applied POR-15 over and under the floor,
 then ill need to put a ne passenger side floor section later, the driver
 side could be salvage with minor patch welding, but at least POR-15 prevent
 the rust to make more damage.
 ill suggest you the same, scrub most of the rust, clean all grease/oil, then
 paint the floor with por15... it will remain at least forever in this state!
