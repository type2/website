Subject: Re: [VB] reduction box sealant

Mario,
I used RTV and it leaks nary a drop on either side.  Just CLEAN everything you will be joining, including the spring plate.  I slathered some around the outside of the plug before I bolted it up to the spring plate.

I also need to know what sealant to use for the large freeze plug on the rear (butts up to the spring plate). I use curil for the engine case halves and it doesn't leak- will this work for the rear end as well? I know how bad the tranny fluid smells and only want to do this once. Thanks.
