 Hi List,
 When I bought my crew cab a few months back, it had
 already been lowered by the previous owner. For
 several reasons I would like to raise it to stock
 height. I bought a parts bus a while back and want to
 use the front beam from it to do the "raising".
 
 Can someone tell me how big a job it is to remove a
 front beam from a 66 Standard and put it in my 63 crew
 cab?? Any tips or "tricks of the trade" would also be
 appreciated. I know a little about wrenching but would
 like to hear from some of you to help build my
 confidence or decide to have it done by a pro.
 
 Thanks in advance,
 
 Pete

It is not that complicated, but is really heavy.   Make sure you have good 
jacks stands, and a real sturdy jack, and pile the tires under the bus just 
in case.  Or a big rectangular block of wood, like 3'x2'x2'.  Get a sturdy 
friend or two to help.  Read the Bentley book.  

Check out the beam you are going to install for the condition of the 
components, so you can get anything you should replace a head of time, 
shocks, steering shock, tie rods, and especially swing lever, as it is much 
easier to do the swing lever when it is out of the bus.  Might want to get 
new brake hoses, and an 11mm flare wrench is you don't already.

You do have to disconnect the shift linkage- remove the front half of this 
when you drop the beam.  SO make sure it'll come un done- spray w/ liquid 
wrench ahead of time.

should be doable in a weekend even counting for running into some problems.
