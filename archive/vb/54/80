 Questions like lift or pit or both?  Roll up or swing out doors?
 Separate work shop from main work bays?  Upstairs storage or storage in
 an underground area or a outside shed?  Air of course, but what type of
 pipe?  How much power?  8 foot or 4 foot lights? ect.
 
 Any input will be greatly appreciated!  Thanks.

roll up doors are nice, I think so at least.   You can't have enough sturdy 
shelves or outlets or light.  Insulation is good.  And don't forget the 
stereo  :) and a small fridge and comfy stools to sit on and bs, I mean 
discuss important bus issues with friends.  Having a separate circuit so you 
flip a switch and the lights come on is a good idea.  I don't have a lift or 
pit, and it seems to work.   It is nice to have part of the garage have a 
really tall door so you can drive the bus into the garage with most of a bus 
on the roof rack, and then pulley the load up , drive the bus back out, and 
then let the load down.  Just in case you might ever do that sort of thing.
