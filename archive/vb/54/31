 I have a 28 PCI that I'd like to put in my bus.  I found it and bought a 
rebuild kit and rebuilt it so I'd like to use it while I'm rebuilding my 28 
PICT.  Problem is my PICT has a hole for the vacuum advance hose but the PCI 
doesn't.  What kind of distributor went with the PCI?  If I were to just use, 
say, a 009 distributor would that solve my problem?  I think my current 
distributor is from a 74 super beetle.  
 
 I like the idea of a manual choke and I think I read in the Idiot book that 
St. Muir used a 28 PCI with different jets in his early bus - that's what I 
want to try.
 
 Also, the spacer thing that goes under my 28 PICT seems too high.  My oil 
bath air cleaner hits the top of my engine bay.  If that was, say, 1/4" 
shorter life would be simpler.  Were these things all one size?  Could I just 
get mine cut down a little bit at a machine shop?

does it fit your intake?  

there are different size spacers.
