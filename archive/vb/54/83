ps.

f you have your wiper motor out , particluarly the kind with the frame, lube 
all the elbows of the linkage.  check the white plastic bushings for wear- 
the hole should be circular not oval or the wipers will be sloppy.  You can 
bench test it with a battery  before reinstalling it to check it out.
