Subject: Wobbly belt?

Would generator bearings be a good bet if my belt wobbles (vibrates
slightly in and out in the same axis of the pulleys), even though it is
tightened to 1/2 deflection. Vibration diminished at engine expansion
warmup, and is negligble at 1250+ rpm...I turned pulley like crazy when
tightening, she's not crooked. I learned that lesson, along with using
ALL the shims either inside our outside when I nuked the front half last
weekend, gladly in the driveway at idle. She screwed up the tabs,
switched to late model center keyed pulley (all that was around), messed
up the generator threads also. Since I didn't have a 19? Mm die, I files
the threads back, with success. Next time this motor is out I am giving
her a new generator, since this one is too unknown, came with the bus,
and most mechanical parts that this bus came with (execption of front
beam) have bad busma...
