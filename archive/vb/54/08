Subject: ADMIN: type2.com server status

All,

Here's the latest on the type2.com server.  Our ISP lent us some memory,
which is why the server is up now, instead of the Tuesday or Wednesday
date given in the last status message.  The old memory has been tested
and is definitely bad; the people we bought the server from are replacing
it under warranty.

There will be another outage while this new memory is installed; the outage
will probably be later this week and hopefully will last for a few hours
tops.

It is generally not necessary to re-send any e-mail you may have sent
to the list.  Most mail servers will queue up email and attempt to
deliver it several times over a few days before giving up, and if the
server does give up, you will get a return e-mail saying so.

Thanks!
