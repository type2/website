When I was doing my resto, my engine mechanic insisted that I send my new
exhaust header setup to JET-HOT, to be permanently coated with this
ceramic coating that repells heat, and lasts forever. The parts are
coated inside and out.

Three different colors to choose from. I sound like a commercial - I'm
more than satisfied, and it's 7 years later - they look new.

They weren't expensive either, and it's worth whatever it costs. It works!
