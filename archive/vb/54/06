Subject: Re: [VB] Stale Air vs. Fresh Air

If you have 2 hoses coming out of the fan shroud down thru
the engine tin and on to the heater boxes, you have fresh air.

Fresh air heaters get their air directly from the fan and push
it through the heater boxes; stale air takes the air that has
already cooled the cylinders.
