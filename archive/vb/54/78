Oops.  I was looking at the '66 wiring diagram.  Neither the '66 diagram
(two speed self parking) or the '63-'65 diagram (one speed non self
parking) will likely apply to you.  Bentley does mention the self-parking
motor for '65 on page E-12 8 but doesn't give a wiring diagram.  Most
self-parking wipers need an extra always-hot wire to the motor (besides
the wire coming from the wiper switch) to work.

Oops again, I was looking at the '66 diagram again.  Clara is right.

The round thing (item J on the '62-'65 diagram) is the flasher and the 
four-prong thing (item J1) is actually a relay to make the front lights
flash when the hazards are on.

If your turn signals work (the flasher clicks and both front and rear
lights on that side blink), and the brake lights are working, then
the hazards should at least flash both rear lights.  If you have
a marginal connection like Clara mentioned, it could make it so the
rear lights can't draw enough current to trigger the flasher in hazard
mode.  Also if the relay (J1) is fouled up it can cause the front lights
to not flash in hazard mode.

I don't have a write-up on the '62-'65 flashers.  The 9-prong box article
I mentioned won't apply.

Especially check the grounds at the tail lights (try running a jumper
wire from the tail light housing or bulb holder to a good ground) and
the connections at the right tail light; if the battery is loose it can
slide back and bash them.

Sorry for the confusion on the year.  The list keeps me honest once
again.  :)
