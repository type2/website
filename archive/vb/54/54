Subject: RE: [VB] changing front beam

What year bus has the shift linkage above the beam and not through it. I
looked at all of mine and the linkage goes through them (the beams).

Hi Volks,
Whoops!  the shift linkage is just above the front beam, not through it so
it 
can be left alone.  Though while the front beam is out it is a best time
with 
the added working room to take it apart and grease everything.  Plus before 
you install the new front beam it is alot easier to redo the center 
pin/bushings.   Eric&Barb
