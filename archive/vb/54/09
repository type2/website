Try 'inflation calculator' at your friendly local search engine.
You won't always get the same answers and some of them don't go
all the way to 2000 or 2001, but they will give you a good idea.
A quick answer, according to one of the calculators, is that $1 in
1967 was $2 in 1979, $3 in 1983-1984, $4 in 1991, and $5 in 1999. 

I have a list of the German prices for new Type 2s but it doesn't
help us much, as the oldest historical exchange rate data I have
been able to find only goes back to 1971.  For grins, though,
a '71 Kastenwagen would have cost you DM 8.375 in January 1971
and at that time, US$1 = DM 3,64, so the price was about US$2300 .
In 2000 dollars that's $9,856.07 .  For a Bus (probably not a
Deluxe), the numbers are DM 9.730, US$2,673 (1971), US$11,450 (2000).

I can't answer this but I can tell you that per Doliwa, there 
were 141,569 Type 2s made in Germany in 1967.  29,049 of them
were imported into the US.
