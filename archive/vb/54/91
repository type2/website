Matt--

FWIW the 'Old Cars Price Guide' pegs the ballpark value of a '62 camper
bus in need of a 'complete restoration (may or may not be running)' as
$2650.  This is a car which is essentially all there and not wrecked. 
For comparison, a '62 standard in similar condition is valued at $2450. 
The next lowest rating category is for 'parts car' at $800-900.

You might try using $2650 as a starting point and subtract the cost of
the items, such as bumpers and interior pieces, that you will need to
add.  Sounds like your $1200 price is reasonable.
