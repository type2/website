 Would generator bearings be a good bet if my belt wobbles (vibrates
 slightly in and out in the same axis of the pulleys), even though it is

 tightening, she's not crooked. I learned that lesson, along with using

take the fan belt off.  grab the gen pulley nut- can you wiggle it? up and 
down or side to side.  Reach around the front of the fan housing and grab 
that big 36mm nut holding the fan to the generator and try to wiggle it.    
It is not supposed to wiggle, if it does the bearing at the wiggly end of the 
generator is bad.   Usually there is a sort of whine associated with bad 
bearings, and if the rear bearing is bad you can see the pulley wobble.  If 
you start the engine up w/o belt and the whine is gone, well, that is where 
it was from.  Don't freak, it is okay to run the motor briefly w/o the belt, 
but don't leave it running or drive like that because of lack of cooling.  If 
you have bad bearings it will wear brushes and belts out, and get worse until 
i dunno it explodes or something, so it would need replacement.
