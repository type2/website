Subject: Re Archiving and webpages updated 

I've had something like that in mind , but as alot of things , i just
haven't gotten to it yet. We are hopefully going to put a small office in
the shop this winter , plans are to take my old slow 166 and make a server
out of it , so then i would have the space and be able or the most part keep
them online at all times. We also have another plan for it as well but no
more news till its in progress As for what Micheal  lost i have the html and
stuff for this year and part of last year on my D: drive now . As for
farther back  if anyone has them p mail me, i would like to have them
myself.
