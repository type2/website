 Doesn't the 67 door have a different pattern for the latch?  Can you use
 an earlier door with its latches?  I know the bolt pattern for 67 is
 different for the latch right?

the piece that the door latch hooks to changed mid 66- the earlier has 3 
screws the later 2 screws, but the mechanism hits them the same.  you can 
bolt a 65 door to a 67 or vice versa no problem.   There is a slight 
difference in the snap holes as the 66/67 doors came with an inside pull and 
the flippers, and I think ya the mechanism is slightly different, but the 
main thing is they are interchangable
