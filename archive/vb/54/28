 In the future, I will need to replace my badly damaged driver's side door.
 What year's doors will correctly fit on my '67 type 2?
 
 Thanks much!

from part way through 64 to end of 67.  A door with the push button style 
handle, and the thingy that props the doors open.  (Earlier doors have pull 
handles and no prop to keep the door open)

The prop is a nice idea, but stresses the hinge and often the lower hinge is 
cracked or broken, so check.
