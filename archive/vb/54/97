Subject: 59 westy FSRe: [VB] 62' bus question

really?

I got a 59 westfalia flip top about a year ago and haven't done a thing to 
it.  clear title, rolls, no motor, pretty complete interior (not sure if it 
has clamshells), typical Wa rust (front floors, rockers bad) straight, bad 
split case tranny (DPO cut off input shaft for clutch alignment tool)  In the 
interest of more space in the back shed I'd be willing to let it go to a good 
home for less than that value of $2650. could throw in a core motor if you 
like.  Needs restoration.  that really neat interior with the wood cabinets 
and metal trim on them.  In W WA state.

 FWIW the 'Old Cars Price Guide' pegs the ballpark value of a '62 camper
 bus in need of a 'complete restoration (may or may not be running)' as
 $2650.  This is a car which is essentially all there and not wrecked. 
 For comparison, a '62 standard in similar condition is valued at $2450. 
 The next lowest rating category is for 'parts car' at $800-900.
 
 You might try using $2650 as a starting point and subtract the cost of
 the items, such as bumpers and interior pieces, that you will need to
 add.  Sounds like your $1200 price is reasonable.
