Subject: changing front beam

Hi List,
When I bought my crew cab a few months back, it had
already been lowered by the previous owner. For
several reasons I would like to raise it to stock
height. I bought a parts bus a while back and want to
use the front beam from it to do the "raising".

Can someone tell me how big a job it is to remove a
front beam from a 66 Standard and put it in my 63 crew
cab?? Any tips or "tricks of the trade" would also be
appreciated. I know a little about wrenching but would
like to hear from some of you to help build my
confidence or decide to have it done by a pro.

Thanks in advance,

Pete
63 Crew Cab - Buck
