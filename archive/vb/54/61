Subject: Re: [VB] Speedo cable and cold weather

Lost one on the Westfailure at 90mph or so. That was a racket. When it
started howling and jumping, I reached under the dash to start unscrewing
the nut. Had it loose when the speedo shelled. Pulled the cable just in time
to whack myself in the finger with it as it delaminated. Nice little blood
blister. The speedo was fixable, cable not. Disassembled and cleaned up the
burrs in the hole and on the spinny part. Gave here a little lube right
there and put it back in. Works fine. Careful where you get lube, though.
And don't tweak the little cups that transmit the signal to the needle. Do
and it is toast. Also had to replace the needle. It whacked that pin hard
and snapped. Had a couple crusty ones to scavenge.
