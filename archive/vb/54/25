Matt,
Alot depends on what part of the country you are in.  I have shopped for a LOT of buses in Ohio, and from my experience, $1200 for a GOOD running bus that is "fixable" is completely reasonable. It seems in the midwest you can't touch a running split window for less tahn $1500.  However, if you are out West, I would venture to guess that you could do much better than this. FWIW...
