Subject: OtherBus not EveryBus 2009 & T-shirt pre-order info

Howdy folks. In case you hadn't heard, due to scheduling conflicts, EveryBus
2009 will be held in October of this year instead of the spring. But never
fear, OtherBus has come forth to give folks the late April NC camping
opportunity you need!
:)
April 17-19th at Van Hoy Family campground in Harmony, NC, right off I-77
and about 77 miles from Hagan Stone park.
More campout info here, on the Full Moon site:

Anyway, I will be doing the shirts for OtherBus, and am going to do it just
like I've done for EveryBus in the past - I will be taking pre-orders now
through Thursday, March 19. I'll have a few shirts available on site, but
those usually go quickly, will cost a couple bucks more, and will only be in
L or XL most likely.
So, save yourself a buck or two, get children's sizes, XXL or XXXL sizes,
long sleves, hoodies, etc and PRE-ORDER!!!
:)
I can take paypal or you can send a check, just like in the past. More
specific detailed info, and of course the grand unveiling of the t-shirt
artwork here:

So happy Friday, and hope to see you there!
