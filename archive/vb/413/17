I've always been interested in raising the ride hight on a splitty by  
installing a bay front beam.  I know that the rear end gets a bit  
weird with the swing axles adjusted so to hight match the front  
end.   Pluses here might be the smoother riding ball join front end  
along with increased ride hight.  Also, the larger gas tank from the  
bay window would be nice in a splitty!
