I did my bus about a year ago and ended using yet a cheaper product form
McMaster Carr. It is supposed to be the same stuff as Fatman and Dynamat
only your not paying for the name. I then used the bubble wrap covered in
foil on top of that.  Here are also some links to Samba articles I kept too.
Good Luck!
