Hi Rob,
Not really any large parts without either massive fabrication, or  having to 
adapt like if you install the 68 front suspension you either have to  lower it 
1.5", or raise the earlier rear to match the front.  Better  to part it out 
and sell off the stuff so you can buy the right year parts.
 
  On the other hand some small parts like the fresh air linkage speed  nuts 
under the dash are same used on 1500/1600 thermostatic flaps.  
E&B
