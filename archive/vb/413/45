Subject: Re: bay WESTY bed in a splitty

John asked:
 Anyone put a z-bed from a bay into a splitty .. I know they fit but I wantit
to fit perfectly .. I did it before and it isn't an exact fit .. like thez-bed
is a little higher or lower or something .. and I made it work withdifferent
thicknesses of foam .. I do not want to do that .. I want to usethe hinges the
bay z-bed and I want the plywood to be exactly level with theover-the-engine
bay metal so I can use identical foam on each .. anyone dosuch a thing? Anyone
have place for such a thing?   ------------------------------

First:   It is a WESTY bed,  NOT a Z bed.  A Z bed is a product made by Z
products to convert a bus SEAT into a fold down bed.  See here:

I have a 74/75 full width Westy bed in my 66 hardtop deluxe. 74/75 was the
only full width USA Westy bed.  Be warned that the split bus is 2" wider than
a bay bus, 1" on each side.  The height is fine with the seat down, but the
split bus is 2" shorter in the back than a bay. The matching bay rear cushion
is 36". The split bus rear area is 34" deep.  Plus you need to notch the rear
cushion like EZ Camper did on my 67 EZ Camper because the split bus rear catch
is forward of the rear section. Unlike bays that are in the rear section.
