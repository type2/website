Freedom and adventure. I think these words really sum up the VW bus
experience. You are freed from the cost of hotels and restaurants and
able to be largely self-sufficient on a bus trip. How this differs
from the RV experience is probably because the expense of an RV far
overshadows the cost of a hotel, and the idea of plunking down money
to own one is diametrically opposed to the do-it-yourself feeling
owning a bus.

 occasional trip.  I want to capture the sense of freedom and adventure that
 embarking on a VW bus trip entails!
