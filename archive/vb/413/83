KING-5, the Seattle NBC affiliate did a story last night about a local
church providing parking spaces where the homeless can sleep in their
cars overnight.  Intermixed with man-on-the-street interviews are
shots of derelict-looking cars and travel trailers, and then a nice
split window westy.

The owner of the westy lives down the street from a friend of mine,
probably ran into the bank or something while the news crew was out
looking for material.

Bus at about 1:15-
