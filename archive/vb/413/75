Tom has a good point. Closed cell foam is a good answer. Try Ensolite. Its
also a good noise barrier. Here is a link to a wholesale supplier.

I spoke with someone there at one time, however I have not made a purchase. As
I recall for noise barrier, you want a product with a skin on one side. The
non-skin side would be placed toward the interior of the bus.
