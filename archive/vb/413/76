If you do it right insulating will also deaden the road noise.  One thing that is important is to have a vapor barrier against the door panel to prevent warping.  The second thing is to use an insulation material that does not absorb water.  Fiberglass roofing material will rust out your doors from the inside out without you able to see until its too late.  You should look in the archives for there should be about 100 posts on this subject.  Insulate your roof too.  It will deaden rood noise and keep you bus cooler in summer too.
