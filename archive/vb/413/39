Subject: A Friday Bug question..

Hey Y'all,
There is a ton of great stuff in the TS library about trouble shooting bus headlight problems...But is there somewhere I can get the same info except for a bug??  I have have deduced that I may have a bad dimmer relay, but not really sure.
I have turn signals and brake light buts No headlights....

PEACE! 
John Baker
