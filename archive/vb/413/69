John,

I used the JC Whitney NASA insulation. ( I found the manufacturer and 
purchased a 50' roll at a much discounted price.) Not necessarily a good 
choice with the foil facing. That will tend to trap moisture. My bus is a 
garage queen in Southern California however so I wasn't particularly worried 
about the moisture. My goal was to try and quiet down the interior.

For a daily driver and campers, I would recommend using something that 
allows the bus to breath and dry out promptly.

Anyone else have recomendations?

Chris
