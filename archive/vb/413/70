Subject: Re: [T2] dynamat vs. fatmat

I used a lot of dynamat in my bus. The entire roof, floor over the engine 
compartment, walls in the back, side doors, humps over the front and rear 
wheels. Found a deal on Ebay long ago. Seems to stick and work well. A newer 
and better product is Damplifier Pro from www.secondskinaudio.com. Can't 
tell you anything about pricing however. Don't know anything about fatmat. I 
tried some Brown Bread, but at the time it was definitely a second rate 
product. I used some and sorry I did.
