Subject: Re: [VB] How to remove crank pulley??

Hi John,
	Sometimes the crank pulleys easily come off using two large  
screwdrivers to lever/pry the pulley off.  Remove the crank bolt and  
give it a try.  You do not want to be to tough on the pulley or you  
will bend it.  I see lots of bent crank pulleys out there.  If that  
doesn't work you'll need to rig up a puller through the two holes in  
the pulley, if it has the holes.  If you have a good spare pulley,  
just lever the old one off.
	Good luck hooking up the engine to the hanger bar by the oil pump  
studs.  If the case has 6mm oil pump studs, the older cases do, I  
would not use this engine in a Bay.  If it has the larger 8mm oil  
pump you still will need to baby your ride until you find the proper  
engine case. Like, avoid bumpy roads and so on.  This will be a short  
term fix, right!  I have a friend who is running his '69 with a 40hp  
and using a chain instead of the hanger bar.  It works.
