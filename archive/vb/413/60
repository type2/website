Subject: Re: [VB] re:squealing wing windows

All of what John said is correct. I believe the problem lies in the larger 
front part of the seal. It's just a hair too thick or hard  and doesn't 
allow the window latch to pull the glass all the way in to the rear seal. 
The rubber somehow needs to be pushed closer to the glass (as I have tried) 
or as Eric and Barb have done, add some foam rubber.

And I agree, eliminating some of that wind noise is good!

Thanks all,
Chris
