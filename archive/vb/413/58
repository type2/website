The success of the seal is a function of the straightness of the glass
and the softness of the rubber such that it has the ability to absorb
the glass edge into itself and contact the entire edge. Short of using
a softer rubber for the seal, all that can be done is to use some kind
of spring reinforcement behind the rubber in order to encourage it to
lift forward towards the glass and seal.
