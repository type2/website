Subject: OCTO report

Howdy Bus Denizens and Pilots,

The OCTO meet today at Huntington Beach High School in Huntington Beach, 
California seems to have been a success. Somewhere around 300 split window 
vehicles reported for duty. A pretty good contingent from Las Vegas showed 
up in their steering gear scrapers. The gate was closed when the lot was 
full and still they kept coming. Hot Dog Fred ran out of brats and dogs an 
packed it in about noon. The final raffle finished a short time later. Swaps 
were good if you were looking for what was available, and of course most 
anything you wanted could be had, and sometimes for a price.
