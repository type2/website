That may be the one Im thinking of.
Thanks to the other replies about the bug advertisement. I think I got the
two ads confused in my head.
I think they are both great. I was more looking for the bus one

I have a bus one.  I have quite a few old Life ads framed, this one is great
(especially for me in AK).  This is likely the one the original poster is
thinking of.  Snow covered road (about 12-15" I'd guess by the height on the
bus and of the tracks) blue bus dissapearing into distance, large rear glass
and tailights, probably a '65 or so.
