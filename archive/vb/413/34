Subject: Re: [VB] Re: How to remove crank pulley??

I've removed crank pulleys by using one of those unversal pullers...

Undo 30mm bolt and remove it... there is a torque value for that bolt, look it up in the bentley or idiot book, something like 30 or 45ft lbs, shouldn't be too tight.
turn the engine so the two holes in the pulley are horizontal
Remove fan belt.
use a couple of long 13mm or 14mm bolts and wiggle one in from the cas eside so the threads are away from the FW? 
might use washers, ?I forget... see if there is room.
use regular puller ... mine have 4 arms in chicken foot pattern, I use the opposite two to attach to the two bolts to... big washers 

I've also put a socket down the crank hole so the threaded part of the puller doesn't?mess up the threads in the crank
Works pretty well.?? There is a special tool, as well, you could buy that.? this is a little fussier to set up, 

I don't like the screwdriver method as it bungs up the pulley snout.
