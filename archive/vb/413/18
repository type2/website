Subject: Bus BRRR Details - Pokegon State Park, IN - Sat. 2/28

Last week it was -19 below in South Bend, IN - must be time to start
planning for Bus BRR!



We are set for for Saturday, February 28th.  Average temps for Angola
Indiana are 35 high and 14 low.

The 5th Annual Buses by the BeachBus BRRR!   (HYPERLINK
"http://www.busesbythebeach.com/" \nWWW.Busesbythebeach.com)
is definitely for the true camping enthusiast and a great use of a VW Bus!
Temperatures can and have dipped below zero at night.  This doesn't stop the
VW Bus diehards from coming out.  This one night campout is held on the last
Saturday in February each year at Beautiful HYPERLINK
"http://www.in.gov/dnr/parklake/properties/park_pokagon.html" \nPokagon
State Park in Angola, Indiana.  Each site includes an electric hook-up so
you can keep warm with an electric heater.  It also comes in handy for
warming up a Crockpot full of Chili for the "Chilly Chili Dinner".  It is
always nice to come back and warm up next to the giant Bonfire after
spending some time on the 35-40mph (faster than your average bus) dual
refrigerated toboggan runs.  Lots of great volks, music, conversation and
fun!   All while supporting HYPERLINK "http://www.phoenix-society.org/"
\nThe Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors.  This year, we are instituting the
"Kozy as a Baked Potato" Award for the warmest looking bus!

Some helpful tips:

Be sure to bring warm clothing for day and night.  A 1200 watt heater
(ceramic is best!)of some sort for the cold nights.  Some of our attendees
have fashioned or purchased Mylar or something similar for insulating the
pop top canvas.  This definitely helps to keep the heat in.  A Crockpot
filled with delicious chili (optional) or a dish to pass for the dinner.
You may consider bringing some snow pants or suit if you plan on using the
toboggan run.  Alcohol is permitted at the park at this time of year, but
obnoxious drunks are never welcome.  Due to the Emerald Ash Borer please
leave the firewood at home.  We'll have plenty to keep the fire roaring.  If
you have any questions about Bus BRRR! please email HYPERLINK
