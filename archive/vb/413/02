I think that is the one I was thinking of, anyone have a copy? Or reprint
online somewhere?

Thanks for the bug info, I saw that one too. I think I may have been getting
the two of them combined in my head.

There was an illustrated print ad showing an early deluxe driving up a
ski slope underneath a ski lift, there is a tiny reprint of it in
Laurence Meredith's "VW Bus Custom Handbook".  No caption about
snowplow drivers, but maybe that's how the lifties get to work?
