Subject: re:squealing wing windows

Hey Chris,

Any luck with the wing windows? Mine do that too, but they have the original
rubber in place. It appears to be a hairline gap between the glass and the
seal, due to the design of the clip. If I open the window a crack the noise
goes away.

It seems to be inherent in the design, having a clamp only on one end, the
wing window seems to have slightly warped to the point that the top of the
wing doesn't make full contact with the gasket.

Anyone have a solution for this, besides opening the window?
