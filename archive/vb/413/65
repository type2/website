Subject: Bus Insulation

We have an old '60 and I removed the mismatched camper kit amd sold it. I stripped all the old foam out (what little there was from E-ZCamper) and used a caulking gun and adhesive and cut and glued foam under-carpet padding everywhere I could, including the hatch, side doors,  and  ceiling.  In the front doors, because of water leaking in at the window track, I used the plastic "bubble-wrap" type insulation with a reflective side. It's seriously cozy in there!
