I *think* you can do this, but you have to open it up and  move the ring
gear to the other side of the case.  Otherwise you get  four speeds
reverse and one speed forward (reduction gear boxes  again).
 
Hi Matt,
Problem with that is the later bus tranny is longer so the engine ends up  
too far back.  Being it is a CV tranny moving the ring over will  result in four 
reverse gears, and still would require converting the  earlier bus to CV 
suspension.  Meaning more time for fabricating or  $$$$.
