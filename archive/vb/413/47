Subject: RE: [VB] Re: bay WESTY bed in a splitty

Thanks Karl .. but I had a full width 'westy' bed in my 60 before .. it just
wasn't that comfortable because of the height difference .. I have the foam
and fabric off of a 3/4 bed and when I measure from the floor to the top of
the plywood it's 18" .. when I measure from the floor to the top of the
engine bay in my 60 it is 18 7/8" ... so ..I'm thinking if I take the bed
apart and make new vertical pieces for either side and the front of the base
and make them 7/8" taller .. then the top of the plywood and the top of the
engine bay should be identical .. then I can just get new high density foam
and redo the cushions ... 

I'm also looking for the perfect interior floor plan .. the floor plan of my
78 is perfect .. I wonder if a similar floor plan  will work in my 60 .. but
then the 60 isn't a walk through ... 

I have an so 44 sink/stove cabinet ... so ... do I use that with the 78
floor plan .. or .. do I put use it as an so44 floor plan ... I'm thinking
if I put it behind the bench seat (so44 style) then I can put in a jump seat
directly behind the driver's seat .. and have a table hinged to the wall
between the westy bed and the jump seat ... 

My 60 is a pop-top ... (similar to a small westy straight up pop-top) 

There are some pretty nice interior floor plans at
http://www.calypsocampers.co.uk/ 

I just don't want to screw up this interior .. I want to try and do it once
..
