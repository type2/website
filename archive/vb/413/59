Subject: Re: [VB] re:squealing wing windows

Hi Chris,
In the almost ten years we have had it that way nobody has noticed, since  
the black foam is against the black of the seal when the windows are  closed.  
Plus having a quieter bus is so nice on the long trips.
  Think the real cause of most of the lack of seal contact is the  lower 
pivot of the wing window gets worn.  Thinking of trying some brass  shim in those 
pivots to adjust the window slightly back in toward the  seal.
E&B

The foam  sounds a little ugly, but I guess it would work. I wanted a more 
elegant  and less obtrusive  solution.
