I found that the new rebonded visco-elastic carpet foam (or memory foam as 
some people call it) is an excellent noise absorber. I would guess it would 
provide some thermal insulation also. I just finished covering my front door 
panels with 1/2" product and a nice charcoal grey automotive fabric. Looks 
nice. My early experiments gave me a 5db noise drop in the cab with foam 
tacked up on the doors, kick panels and my non-walk thru partition.

Carpet foam padding usually has a plastic film on one side that would help 
the foam retain moisture. Maybe not a good choice against the metal.

I  just filed a nice article printed out from the archives on Bar Oil. Get 
one that lists a rust preventive. Spray on and wait a week or two for it to 
dry out. Then insulate. Might work.
