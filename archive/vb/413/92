Subject: Bus sighting, Flags of our Fathers

At about the 1 hour 10 minute mark when Ira trips walking up the stairs
after the War Bond Drive scene with the mothers, the Gunny says "get some
sleep" across the street is a VW Bus. To bad the movie was set in early
1945... 5 years before the Bus was actually made, let alone sold in the USA.
