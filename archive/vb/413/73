The moisture that gets in walls of a building or vehicle is from  
vapor migration which travels from warm to cold even in dry areas.   
You should always place the vapor barrier between the warm side & the  
insulation or the vapor will condense in the insulation because that  
is where it will reach the dew point & cause problems.  It has very  
little to do w/ rain getting in the wall, although that is much more  
likely in the doors.  Closed cell insulation does not let moisture  
get absorbed in the insulation so a closed cell insulation w/ vapor  
barrier, like Dynamat, to the inside of bus is the best bet.

YMMV,
