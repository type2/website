Subject: Former, Current and Future Old Bus Review readers

Every so often I like to offer anyone on the list
some recent issues of Old Bus Review. If you'd
like the last edition or two, send me an email and I'll send you pdf files.

Thanks,

Tom

Got a VW Bus Story you'd like to share?
Do you know someone else who does?

A collection of stories of life and adventure
with the VW Bus is coming together! Were looking
for tales of travel adventure; tidbits of daily
life with a VW Bus; memories of your first
sighting of a Bus; the first Bus you ever owned;
weddings and celebrations where VW Buses held a
prominent position; stories of Bus enthusiasm
passed down from generation to
generation-anything related to the glories (and
predicaments) of VW Busing. Photos and artwork are welcome.

If you have material you'd like to contribute, or
for more information, please contact Tom
Brouillette (editor of NEATOs Old Bus Review) at: type2tom(-at-)earthlink.net
