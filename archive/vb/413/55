Kevin,

As a test, I stuck a narrow strip of .03" thick plastic shim stock under the 
edge of the seal on the inside to push it closer to the window. Partial 
success, I need to double that. This pushed the wipers on that straight 
piece closer to the glass so there is now a little compression on them. 
Previously, there was almost no contact.

I have not had a chance to get back to the problem.

Just to be clear, this is the vertical seal at the trailing edge of the 
window.
