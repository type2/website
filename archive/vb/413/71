in my 70, i have a layer of 'E&B tar' on purt nar evvahthang, and 
then used that bubble stuff with aluminum foil on both sides.  worked 
great.

HOWEVER.

i lived in texas and phoenix, az, and the combo was - not - happy in 
the long run. the tar dried to a rock-hard layer (that's ok), and the 
bubble wrap became firmly embedded in it (that's not as ok).  what's 
worse, the heat put the zap on the plastic substrate in the bubble 
wrap, and ALL of the aluminum foil is flaking off. everywhere. 
with the windows open on the highway, it can look like tinkerbell is 
flying around back there...
