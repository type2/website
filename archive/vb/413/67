Subject: RE: [VB] Insulaton

I thought about that stuff .. but isn't there a stuff that has some sort of
reflective foil on one side .. that might be good .. and how bout vapour
barrier .. should that go between the insulation and the interior panel or
between insulation and exterior panel . I was thinking I'd spray oil all
around the inside of the metal panel .. then insulation . then plastic
vapour barrier then interior panel .. hmmm
