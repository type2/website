Hi JDD,
No, please no.  Will not work, and just end up trapping more moisture  in 
there.  The only way to make that work is to then cut/drill vent holes  all over 
the exterior of the VW to allow out the vapor.
  Check out the owner manuals for the Beetle in the 1960s.  For  long term 
storage the windows must be left cracked open to avoid having moisture  from 
building up in the well sealed VW!!
