Subject: part needed and a question

hey guys
I'm looking for the left side slideing window for my 77 Riviera.
Now was this a Riviera part or did VW offer it on the latter bays?
Anyway turns out we have to go to Seattle this weekend and i was hopeing
someone might have one in their stash to sell.
thx
