here's a pic of the "daisy":

click on the 087 pic. it's the white plasticy looking
thing.
i have never ever ever seen a broken one of these that
"came apart" in the trans. scored, worn, yes. broken,
no. the material they are made of and their location
makes them pretty much unbreakable. they are there to
eliminate noise of the axle tube when it moves up and
down and to prevent wear to the side covers and the
insides of the ends of the axle tubes. earlier
trannies (splitcases) did not have this part and they
wore there.

diane, it's really time to get a new mechanic. ship
your bus out here, and i'll fix it, and then you can
drive it home.
