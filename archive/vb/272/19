Subject: Re: [VB] guages - many questions

my oil temps really depend on ambient temps a lot.  warmed up, freeway 
driving is from 70C to 100C, depending on winter to a hot summer day laden.   The 
only time I got above 100C was in Arizona, fully laden bus up long hill, where 
it got to 110 C (230F)  

Oil pressure is higher when starting cold, warm idle about 10-20 psi, freeway 
about 40-50, if I remember right what my engien that's in the 61 gave.    I 
don't have  a pressure sender in my 61 now, just in the 65 which has a fat oil 
filter pump on it, and it gives higher pressure, so I have to run 10 30 wt oil 
in it or burst a filter after a cold freezing night.  

only time I had a cylinder head temp sender was when I was doing the cooling 
tests for my physics project and I think it varied from 100C to 120C above 
ambient, this was at ambient temps about 16C .  Depends on idle to freeway.  
Sender was under #1 spark plug.   as it was easiest, I guess #3 is normal, but it 
shouldn't matter if you have a doghouse, right?  its #3 that gets the 
prewarmed air from the upright cooler, but with doghouse  it doesn't get that.   
right?   

This engine has type IV cooler in doghouse.  SP.  I cleaned loads of casting 
flashing out of the heads when I assembled it, after the DP heads got messed 
up (I mean part came out with spark plug) to let air blow through fins better, 
so it may run cooler than most motors.  After the replacement heads (went dp 
to sp), new rings, new rod bearings, and conversion to type IV from regular 
dog,  oil temps were 5 to 10C lower when warmed up on freeway... pretty 
significant.  

I recently got a guage that reads from 40 to 120 C oil temps, to replace the 
one from 60 to 150 C or was it 150 to 300F?.   I mean, now I can watch it warm 
up.   and that last  50*F the oil is already burnt, so who cares?

<<  The guages in question are a CHT, oil temp and oil
 pressure.  I got the dual sender for the pressure, so that one is covered.
 The CHT has the spark plug mount.  Does this give an accurate reading?  Is 
the
 #3 the norm cyl.  for mounting?  are there alternitives?  I think that is
 about it.  What are the normal operating temps / pressure for these guages?
 The engine is a 1600DP with out any modifications >>
