Once again Matt, some very compressive useful advice.  Thanks!

Well, these aren't the newest set of cables around.

Yes, I'm trying to start this on the ground to make tuning the dual
carbs easier and to detect any leaks.  I like to do this if possible as
it eliminates a re pull if there are problems.

Yes, I'm using a gutted 6V tranny case/housing.  There are no guts/gears
what so ever.

I'll try this.  I'd not thought of that.  Thanks.

Yes I'm sure, as this car is a very original (62K) one owner car (T3). 
I don't think the motor had ever been removed before.  Almost every
part/hose/wire is original.  It sat for 25 years.  When I can get the
starter to engage (even though it is briefly, there are no grinding noises)

Thanks again!!
