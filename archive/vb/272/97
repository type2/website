ohyeah, forgot... i have a berg acheiver pulley on here, too! NOW i 
have to call em and find out if its one of the too-small ones :P
however, a too-small crank pulley would result in higher oil temps at 
the cooler, so that at least seems not to be a factor here. i do want 
a 356 gen pulley, but need to pinch nickles for a while before i can 
get one. i have noticed that this new engine/new tranny/tire combo 
likes to do 2200- 2500 rpm in 4th at 45 or so, and i'd rather have 
the fan turning a bit faster at those crank speeds.
