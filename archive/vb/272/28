I'd be interested to see if there "version" like the original.  I can
find that color all day long at just about any good auto upholstery
shop, but getting the same thickness (the original was Naugahyde.) is
almost impossible in a new fabric. I've also never found the exact same
texture either  Maybe they found a supply of old stock?
