Subject: Arizona Transaxle Exchange involved-2alarm Fire!

Late (Thursday) evening television news reported a two alarm fire at a cabinet
shop in west-central Phoenix, AZ. Cross roads given via map/graphic followed by
video footage of firefighters entering a building with Arizona Transaxle
Exchange on the door/sign.

Please pray for Mr. Bill Capatch and staff. Highest quality of people and
quality products. Basically, one of the last consistantly top notch Arizona
sources of Volkswagen T1-T2-T3-T4 transaxles and parts.
