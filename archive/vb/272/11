Unless it's an obvious mechanical thing, you're either really low on brake
fluid, or there is a leak somewhere in the braking system (most likely).
Dump some fluid in the brake reservoir, and pump the brakes. If it comes
out somewhere, there's yer leak. You'll have to remove all four brake
drums to see leaks clearly, but if a wheel cylinder is leaking, there
should be a telltale puddle under a wheel shortly. Check all lines under
the bus as well, looking for leaks.

The pedal could go to the floor if all the brake shoes are really out of
adjustment also. Check that first, do the brake adjustment procedure in
the Idiot manual, and then bleed your brakes.

Heck, do all of the above!
