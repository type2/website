Hi Craig,
It could be the oil cooler is blocked up internally.  We have seen one cooler 
stand that was not drilled through properly at the VW factory and the engine 
still ran for 30,000 original miles due to being driven only very short drives 
by a little old lady.  Also we have seen a couple of oil passages that were 
barely drilled through in German engine cases causing restictions.  Perhaps the 
passage to the oil cooler is partly blocked.  Did you remove all the oil 
passage plugs and inspect for properly cast/drilled passages??  Not sure which 
side of the type 3 cooler the oil pressure hole is but it could be on the side 
that is coolest.  You really want to measure oil temp before it is cooled to 
know what is going on inside the engine.  You might want to try a type 4 cooler 
and 356 Porsche generator pulley.
