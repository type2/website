i'd like to hear more opinions on this topic.  jon and i recently re-did nearly the entire brake system on my girly ghia with new stuff.  one of the drums replaced was an original.  the drum was judged thin and scored; well used beyond continued service and too thin to turn.  the opinion of the house is that driving on severely pitted/scored drums is a good way to destroy brake shoes.  further if the drums aren't resurfaced, it's just a waste of time and brake shoe money.  so the original drum and all the others were replaced.

another vw person i know opinioned that original drums should only be turned when they are out of round.  grooves are apparently not a problem for the drum as they "increase surface area once the shoe has worn into them in a few miles of service; grooves do not harm service life much.  for very deep grooves, [one might] turn [the drum] but it's neither required nor particularly useful."

apparently part of this contention is over current production drums.  there is a problem with "lax quality control and a slightly softer iron.  a very high percentage of the new stuff from mexico/brazil/wherever have been machined improperly and the problems aren't caught in the inspection process.  flaws seen first hand include a badly mis-oriented axle bore, a lug pattern that's way off center and a cockeyed shoe friction surface - not axially oriented...  the softer iron shows itself in poorer lug thread quality and they strip lugs a lot more easily."
