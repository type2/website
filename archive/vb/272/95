Subject: Re: [VB] turning drums (was:stuck drum again)

  I have turned all my drums on all my buses and have gotten excellent ware out of them. 63,000 on my DD and just needed to replace the front shoes due to heat cracks. I haven't put enough miles on any of my other buses to bother checking, all their brakes still work great.
   I do not sell Mexi or Brazil drums (current production) due to their really POOR quality. I have a few NOS early Brazil bus drums that are EXCELLENT (these are at least 20 or more year old Brazil procution rear bus drums)
  The machine shop here locally does and excellent job of truing and glaze braking of drums. When I take him drums he only takes off enough material to tru them up and cut the glaze. He has saved a lot of the 5 dollar swap me throw-a-ways that peolple have thought were junk.

i'd like to hear more opinions on this topic. jon and i recently re-did nearly the entire brake system on my girly ghia with new stuff. one of the drums replaced was an original. the drum was judged thin and scored; well used beyond continued service and too thin to turn. the opinion of the house is that driving on severely pitted/scored drums is a good way to destroy brake shoes. further if the drums aren't resurfaced, it's just a waste of time and brake shoe money. so the original drum and all the others were replaced.

another vw person i know opinioned that original drums should only be turned when they are out of round. grooves are apparently not a problem for the drum as they "increase surface area once the shoe has worn into them in a few miles of service; grooves do not harm service life much. for very deep grooves, [one might] turn [the drum] but it's neither required nor particularly useful."

apparently part of this contention is over current production drums. there is a problem with "lax quality control and a slightly softer iron. a very high percentage of the new stuff from mexico/brazil/wherever have been machined improperly and the problems aren't caught in the inspection process. flaws seen first hand include a badly mis-oriented axle bore, a lug pattern that's way off center and a cockeyed shoe friction surface - not axially oriented... the softer iron shows itself in poorer lug thread quality and they strip lugs a lot more easily."
