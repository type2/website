Subject: Re: [VB] turning drums (was:stuck drum again)

i have purchased several different rear drums for my bus and 2 others 
i worked on last year - they were from both brazil and mexico. the 
brazilian ones would not even GO ON THE AXLE. the mexican ones just 
poorly cast and slightly out of round. in each case we dug out old 
drums that were still within thickness spec, cleaned them, and ran a 
stone to break glaze on em and put em on.
i had one rear drum once that had grooves in it, and the pads wore 
into them... bus would pull slightly to that side, presumably due to 
higher surface contact.
