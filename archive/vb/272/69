Subject: 6V starter

I'm trying to start a 6v motor with a 6v starter.  All original motor
but it sat for a long time.  With a good 6v battery all I can do is get
the solenoid to click.  It will not turn the engine over.  I hooked my
bus (12v) to it and while it was idling I can get the starter to engage
and barely turn the motor in about 1/2 revolutions.  All this while the
plugs are out and I've oiled the cylinders down.  I can turn the engine
over with a breaker bar and socked on the pulley end.  It is fairly
tight, but not overly so, about what a good tight new motor would be like.

I've taken the starter all apart and cleaned it and checked the
brushes...all is as it should be.

Any ideas why the starter is not functioning...especially when supplied
with 12-13 volts??  Thanks

Steve
