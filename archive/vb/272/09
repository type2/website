Subject: less steering play

I like alot of folks thought buying a rebuilt steering box was the only way to cure the steering play.I cured most of my problems on my 61 singlecab by simply lubeing the center bushing, it was dry as can be. . I then added a cofab dampner . I just got back from a 1060 mile trip pulling a tear drop trailer and it steered like a dream., P
