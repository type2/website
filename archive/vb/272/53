Subject: temp. question

I just had my bus on the freeway for the first time today.  I kept it right
around 60.  I noticed my CHT guage was reading around 375.  Is this a normal
temp or a bit on the high side for freeway drivin.  Oil pressure was hanging
bout 30-40

Just trying to get a feeling for my new guages.
