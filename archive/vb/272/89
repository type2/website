Typical usual work to be performed at the current shop ? :)
Did you see the engine support brace welded to the frame 
to "fix" an "oil leak" ? This should destroy the transaxle soon.
The "clunk" previously attributed to broken "motor mounts"
could be high mileage axle shaft fulcrum plate wear,
if not broken transaxle mounting blocks.
The engine was "rebuilt" under "warranty" without disturbing 
a layer of primer dust from paint sanding two weeks prior.
It leaks the same, and evidently needs another "rebuild".
It never got to the first 500-mile "inspection".
The brakes were installed such that she could not move
the pedal an inch. This 67 bus also got a "12-volt conversion".
The shop installed a fuel sender bur deferred the gauge wiring
to a "professional ". They don't do electrical work:).
There are so many bogus repairs in  this scam it is hard 
to keep up with the history. Remember the steering problem ?
Muffler installed through holes drilled in the bumper ?
