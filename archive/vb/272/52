Subject: Re: [VB] Everything I know about my tranny

A thunk when you step on the gas suddenly or off the gas,or releasing clutch  
suddenly indicates wear at the fulcrum plate/crown gear/inner axle end.    
like you said in #5.

you can check this by jacking up the rear wheel, ebrake off, front wheels 
blocked front and back, and wiggle the wheel, like turn it forward/back.   if 
there is space before you feel the tranny move, yup, that confirms it.   

Rumbly noises when you turn that rear wheel, or being able to move the axle 
shaft up/down indicate bad reduction box bearings.

while the fulcrum plate area does not have anything to do with shifting or 
popping out of gear, it is a bunch of work to replace worn parts with new.  Nice 
axle shafts are hard to find.  when I erdid my 61, I had been collecting axle 
shafts when I could find them cheap at swaps, I got a dozen or more to get 
two really nice ones.  oh, and it will be hours of work to replace worn parts 
with good.  

If you read your bentley/ muir books, and crawl under the bus, maybe what the 
mechanic says would make more sense.  read the muir like a novel, like 
someone on the list said.   There are plastic pieces/covers under the axle tube by 
the fulcrum plate area some people call daisy wheels, that may have been what 
the mechanic said.  I learned them as Kaiser Spheres.   whatever.

the clutch noise at the floor indicates something is sloppy or ungreased up 
front. or bent.   a new cable would NOT cause fulcrum plate wear, FP /axle wear 
comes from tens of Ks of miles of driving.  Sometimes old cables start to 
break.  New cables do stretch a little and will need some adjustment later.

the thunk is not related to the case crack.  yes they can tell the mounts are 
okay w/o pulling the motor, like the process I described before.

maybe the clutch adjustment nut is backing back off.  Maybe the pedal pivot 
is loosening up.  I'd pull that pivot apart and regrease it if it were my bus.

sounds like you got a bus with typical lack of maintenance and years of wear. 
 Yes, this all costs a lot to pay someone to fix.

<<  hate to keep beating a dead horse .. but here is another email about my
 tranny .. clutch .. thunk and grind ..
 
 A quick note before I start:  Stopped at the mechanics from hell yesterday,
 he, the father, wanted to talk to me about my bus, my complaints .. etc etc 
..

 When I came back he told me it isn't a broken mount, don't ask how he knew or
 why he said that .. It was gibberish .. what he said was he thought it was in
 the axel .. I think he said "tulip" or some flower .. came apart or ???
 
 1)  Had to push the clutch ALL THE WAY to the floor in the beginning to
 release the clutch or engage the clutch or what ever ... In doing that .. the
 metal would rub on metal VERY CLOSE to the floor .. a HORRIBLE sound.  At 
that
 time there was NO "thunk" noise.
 
 2)  Son # 2 went under the bus and adjusted the clutch so it didn't need to
 reach the floor to shift.  Thinking back, I have to wonder if he did 
something
 to screw up the cable, because next visit there they installed a new clutch
 cable ..
 
 3)  After the clutch adjustment, I can't remember which came first the 
"clunk"
 or the whirrrrr of the throw out bearing .. almost at the same time.
 
 4)  Clutch cable replaced at the same time as the throw out bearing at the
 same time as they pulled the engine and discovered the crack in the case.  My
 thought from that moment on was there was a broken mount and the tranny
 banging on the case cracked it.  But then, would the mount crack during 
clutch
 adjustment ?? Just a thought .. I am clueless.
 
 5)  I can duplicate the thunk by tapping the gas pedal .. or releasing the
 clutch too fast .. never hear a thunk when I hit a bump in the road .. should
 I if a mount is broken ?? I remain clueless .. AGAIN ...
 
 6)  If they didn't pull the engine out .. can they really tell if a mount is
 broken ?? Also he said he SUSPECTS this "tulip" thing .. "his friend the
 tranny guy agrees.... " yadda yadda ...
 
 ANOTHER THING to take into consideration ..
 
 7)  When I am driving I NEVER pop out of gear .. the shifter doesn't move ..
 BUT .. When I am in reverse - back up - then put it in 1st .. most of the 
time
 it POPS out of reverse .. sometimes it doesn't .. sometimes it just slides 
out
 and slides easily into first .. ALSO .. when this happens, the NO POPPING out
 of reverse, the shifting seems much smoother .. and no grinding .. I won't
 swear to it .. but I don't think I hear the thunk noise .. so don't use that
 in this logic problem .. but it shifts smooth through 4th .. and eventually
 goes back to the grindy shifting thing ..
 
 8)  LAST .. seems I have to press the clutch closer and closer each day to 
the
 floor to shift without grinding .. and yet, going ALL THE WAY to the floor no
 longer makes the metal on metal sound ...
 
 I love listening to the logic from this group .. I believe what you all say
 more than any mechanic in town that is trying to get into my wallet ...
