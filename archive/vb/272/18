Subject: Re: [VB] stuck drum again

OK, I got the drum in question back from the brake
shop, all smooth and nice inside, and it slid on with
no problem, and spins beautifully.
I took a close look at the other drums, and I think I
understand the problem...over the years, the place
where the shoes rub stays smooth, but the outside edge
of the braking surface of the drum builds up a "lip"
of rust...like a raised ridge all around the inside of
the drum. And then the bus sat for 10 years, and this
lip only got bigger...
So that explains why the rear drums would turn, but
wouldn't come off. The lip was catching on the
shoes...and when i pulled them off with a puller, the
shoes were pulled out by that lip/ridge.

So I'm going to go get the others done, and that will
be every single brake component replaced/renewed
except the springs and the pedal...

The only metal line I haven't gotten to is the one
that goes over the tranny...that one looks like it's
going to be the hardest one...contemplated leaving it,
but I wouldn't feel right doing every single metal and
rubber line except one....
