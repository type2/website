Hi Josh,
Your year bus MC is the best way to go, the earlier one is single ciruit and 
if andy brake line or slave/wheel cylinder goes bad you loose the while 
braking system.  If cost is a factor then you can install a 1972-79 bus MC.  Check 
the type2 library for the article we wrote on the subject.
