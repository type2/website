E & B, I tried that welded on 14mm aluminum stud thing around #3 back in the
80's and had to give it up because of sheet metal clearance issues. The
factory heads with the threaded sensor hole were designed with the additional
metal in that place for strength, but also because of the additional metal it
retains the heat longer giving a more even temp sense.

Hi Tom,
We do not like mounting the sender under the spark plug because it will be
damaged from taking out the spark plug for normal maintance.  We have been
plotting on welding on a mounting stud onto the head near #3 spark plug as
possible.
