Head temp goes up with engine load.

Oil temp seems more effected by rpm's. Load as well, but rpm's really seem
to give it a kick in the pants.

You can stick as many oil coolers on your engine as you want, it will not
effect the head temp more than a couple of degrees. That's why it's nice to
have a gauge for both. Adding oil coolers can give you a false sense of
security when it comes to your engine's temp. You can overheat an aircooled
VW engine without the oil temps going over 200 degrees. I did it about 7-8
years ago.  :-)
