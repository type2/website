  I couldn't really say where the best place for a cylinder head temp sender would be. I have some NOS  311 101 375G heads and they have a boss where number 3 cylinder would be that goes directly into the rocker are areas.. In all of the CB Perfromance fuel injection systems I have installed I drill a hole above the bale boss ,tap it and thread in a cylinder temp sender they for the fuel injection.

E & B, I tried that welded on 14mm aluminum stud thing around #3 back in the
80's and had to give it up because of sheet metal clearance issues. The
factory heads with the threaded sensor hole were designed with the additional
metal in that place for strength, but also because of the additional metal it
retains the heat longer giving a more even temp sense.

Hi Tom,
We do not like mounting the sender under the spark plug because it will be
damaged from taking out the spark plug for normal maintance. We have been
plotting on welding on a mounting stud onto the head near #3 spark plug as
possible.
