There isn't a good picture of these in either the early or the late
Bentley manuals, or Muir.  There is, however, a good picture in the
parts manual - callout #2 (part no. 113 301 111) on page 223 of
http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part.html .  It does kinda
look like a big flower with petals around the edge.

You can't see this part when your Bus is put together.  It goes between
the side of the transmission and the flange on the end of the hollow
tube that surrounds the solid drive axles.  I think it helps control
the end play of the tube, so if it's broken, the tube could conceivably
move in and out and make noise.
