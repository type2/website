Well, if Maxwell's demon actually worked, you could get AC for free.  It's
just a matter of sorting the hot molecules from the cold ones.

Unfortunately, the only way to do this in reality involves a multi-step
process.  You have to compress a working gas, heating it up and consuming
work.  You then run that gas through a heat exchanger, which dumps
energy (both the work energy, and the energy removed from the inside air)
to the outside.  Then you take the resulting cooler fluid and run it
through an expansion orifice (a rather wasteful way to do it, but cheap)
to reduce its pressure and temperature.  The cool gas is then run through
another heat exchanger to pick up heat from the interior air.

Obviously, this system requires mechanical energy inputs to work.  The
amount of energy depends upon the quantity of fluid moved through the
system and the properties of that fluid.

The fluid is almost always Freon, usually F-12 or F-134, so the mechanical
energy input required is pretty much a constant for all systems of the
same capacity.  There's no "magic fluid" that has come along to suddenly
reduce the energy requirement of AC systems.

What has come along are better compressors that run cooler and with less
leakage.  Compressor heat has to be handled by the system just like all
other heat sources, so if you can reduce compressor heating the entire
system can be made smaller and will use less work input.

About the only way to improve current AC systems is through a mechanical
expander, which would recover some of the energy used to compress the gas,
but that would lead to twice as many lines and much higher complexity in
the AC compressor

The old axial compressors were real dinosaurs, with high-friction
swash-plate driven pistons.  From an engineer's point of view, they were
running in a bath of coolent, so why not make a lot of heat through
friction!  In the days of 25 cent gasoline that made sense.
