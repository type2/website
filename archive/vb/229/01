  Dave at CE has always made his own bases for the Safari latchs and uses
Brazilian wing vent latch pieces for the rest. I have never heard of one of
his bases breaking. If you break the latch piece you just need to get a repo
vent latch to replace that broken part. 
  He has tooled up to make the latch piece but I do not know if they are
ready yet. There were a few sets of Safaris shipped to the U S with-out
latchs (which did show up finally) but the old style.

Creative is still in the process of improving their latches which have had a
history of failure. I put off buying their safaris with the hope that they
would have completed their latch improvements. To this date they have not
begun to market the new & improved latches (which I am told will be
stainless) but extended me the courtesy of replacements once they became
available, should the old ones fail.
