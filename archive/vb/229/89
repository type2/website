Hey Adrian,
I have rebuilt my Matt special a couple of times using various styles of
relays and several different types of electronic flashers and all of them
worked fine. The only difference is not having the dash light blinking at the
same time as the turn signal, but alternating, no big deal. I spent some time
going through the NAPA catalog and found many relay numbers that would work
for the future if needed. Anyway, Besides flooding it out a couple of times
with rain water leaking out of my package tray, it works great. Now I have to
replace my turn signal switch.

Hi there,

I am getting rid of the 9-PIN box using Matt's instructions for replacing it
with 4 SPDT relays and a #559 flasher, method #2.

Small question here:
Basically would a #550 flasher do the same thing?


Thanks,
