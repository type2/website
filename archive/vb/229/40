I think the factory installed seat belt mounts for the rear and middlewere started in 66.  Double check to see if you have them-- they maybe be filled with a large plastic screw.  My 65 doesn't have them in the back, but does in the front. If you dont, you can still install belts, but you have to have a Big A## washer on the underside to spread the load 'just in case'.   I installed seat belts in the front of my 61 bus, and used pieces of torsion leaf bars-- which are really hard to drill through, but that'll spread the impact area out a lot! (61 didn't have stock seat belt mounts anywhere)

for front seat belts the shoulder thing, you need an upper mount.  Best to get a nut plate welded into the pillar behind the door.  May look a little funky, but there it is.  I have seen bolts all the way through the pillar, which relies on thin sheet metal in case of an accident, plus a bolt on the outside of the bus (frankenstein fashion).
