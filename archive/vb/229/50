  If you can find someone with a crank dowel hole jig you can do it
yourself. These are the jigs used for 8 doweling a crank and flywheel. It
is easy and can be done fairly quick.

I think I'd spend the money to get the van back home and do the job right
with a new crank and flywheel.
Store your bus somewhere.
Ride the Grey Dog Bus home and come back with a trailer / tow bar / tow
dolly and get your bus.
If you don't do the job right you'll never be able to leave town in it
for distant locations without that nagging feeling and having anal
twinges at every tiny noise.
