Subject: sunroof question

I have a decent sized gap between my sunroof and the roof of my bus,
what is the best way to seal this gap is there an adjustment?  it's
coming around to the season where it doesn't matter anymore but I would
still like to make my bus airtight (or as airtight as possible)
  Thanks for you help
