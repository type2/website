Subject: Quality vent wing latches?

Apparently, not all vent wing latches are created
equal.  Last night, after disassembling and reassembling
the driver's side door of my '66 standard to replace
the vent wing latch that the thieves who tried to steal
my radio broke, the new shiny latch I bought for a few
bucks at the local VW shop promptly snapped off in my hand
the second time I latched it.

I see that Wolfsburg West sells a 5 dollar Brazilian version
of this latch and that they also sell some German latches for
$50.  I'm assuming that the Brazilian latch is what I got
locally and that they are all junk.  However, $50 seems like
a lot of money for this small part.

Can anyone direct me to a source of sturdy vent wing latches
that aren't over priced?

Thanks and Best Regards,
