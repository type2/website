Well,
more and more territory opened up for cleaning when the case was opened. I get
the block back from the shop at the end of the week and will have to spend a
few hours on it. I hadn't even noticed the big elephant ear projections of
casting flash in the oil tower hole, pics on that soon. There were many other
areas shown to me today where I might take my die grinder and clean it up
before it falls into the case. After that I will take it back for a good
flushing and reinspect. When the cylinder bores were opened for 90.5 there
were some casting defects that showed up, I will take a pic before it is
welded.

Some might wonder why I bother. Well, the basic block is good and solid and
should last a lot of years. I'm willing to spend on repairs what the block
should have cost in addition to the purchase price if it had been done right.
It's not like I was buying a three piece AutoCraft or Scat race block. As
thick as the ribs are in this thing you could put Chevy bearings and big crank
in it. In a lot of places it is thicker than a T-4 or a Vanagan block.

Between all of us, we should have a pretty good data base on this thing for
future use.

Bernoulli Interval: Do I really have enough data to draw a valid conclusion ?
