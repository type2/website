My wife would never put up with a second woman in my life. That's why the
truck is Thumper and the trike is Bob !

   You know you have a good wife when you haven't seen her for more than
20 minutes in the last three weeks and she is still willing to let you
go into the garage.

I am still working on getting pictures taken of clementine in her new
digs, my digital camera does not have flash so I will need to wait to
sol breaks over the horizon (I tried using the garage lights and you
could barely tell it was a bus in the picture)


Take care bus people, I'm getting to tired to type
    Tim Johnson
          and
    Clementine
