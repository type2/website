I agree that modern compressors are more efficient than older ones.  My
main point is that the hp used by the compressor sets an absolute upper
bound on how much cooling the system can provide.  It takes a certain
amount of work to move a given amount of heat, and all that work
ultimately has to come from the compressor.  If this idea is not correct,
I'd like to know how it is wrong.
