yup. >Cylinder fins, for cooling. >Fan on engine for cooling.
 NOT necessarily for oil... for the heads and cylinder mainly, with

Right! I felt it necerrary to include those in the concept because the
engine oil also cools the cylinder walls or visa versa the cylinder heat
up the oil and the fan and pan remove the heat.
