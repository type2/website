I don't have any specific "it doesn't fit" experience, but last summer
I did some calculations on what kind of horsepower you need to run an
air conditioner that might be interesting:

Basically, feeding 1 hp into a perfectly efficient air conditioner yields
about 2500 Btu/hr of cooling.  The original dealer-installed AC was
probably around 12,000 Btu/hr, which means it took at least around 5 hp
to drive it.  The Type IV engine will probably have power to spare, but
it's something you may want to be aware of.
