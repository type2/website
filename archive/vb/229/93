Subject: Got that shift rod out!

I think it was Clara who suggested heating the shift rod tube and 
cooling it multiple times. Well, that's the one that worked!

My rod was rust-welded to the tube. I had broke off the front 3 
inches when I originally tried to remove it. After trying all kinds 
of stuff, I grabbed a torch and heated the tube where I figured it 
was rusted together. Made that sucker glow! I cooled it down with a 
bowl of water and a rag and repeated the process a few times. I 
banged on the road from the rear after each time. The 3rd time it 
moved!

I didn't have luck trying to bang it out from the front, so I got a 
broom stick and banged at it from the rear and pushed it out the 
front. I had to cut the rod a couple of times 'cause it ran out of 
room up front. But it eventually came out and I'm very happy.

What's crazy is 80% of the rod is nice shiny metal. It was just that 
6-12 inches at the front that was all rusted and at least a part of 
it was rusted to the tube.

Greg S. in Elgin hooked me up with a replacement. So now I can move 
on to cleaning the tube up and getting to fabricating a front tranny 
mount for the later bus front tranny mount. Hey Ronnie, feel like 
writing those instructions on how to do that down again?

I put a picture of the rod here: http://type2guy.com/59sc/59sc3.html

I hope to start having updates on my website again. It's been almost 
a year since I've done any real VW work!!! This new (old) house has 
been a B*tch.
