The guy last year http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/063335.html
was claiming 32,000 Btu/hr of cooling using 1.5 hp, which is impossible.
Since Congress hasn't repealed the laws of thermodynamics, it's still
impossible.

If your compressor only draws 2 hp, the system can only provide about
5,000 Btu/hr of cooling.  Tops.  Doesn't matter what kind of compressor
or refrigerant or condenser or evaporator it uses.  2 hp _is_ 1.41
Btu/sec or 5090 Btu/hr.  It's the law.

In http://www.type2.com/archive/vintagebus/043445.html I worked out that
it would take about 3600 Btu to change the temperature of the interior of
a Bus by 43 degrees C.  If you only want to bring the temperature down to
77 F, you only need about 2930 Btu.  A 5,090 Btu/hr A/C will do that in
around 35 minutes.

Another way to look at it: if your Bus was parked in the sun and got up
to 140 F inside, it would take about 22 minutes for a 5,090 Btu/hr A/C
to cool it down to 100 F.  The word most people would use to describe
an auto A/C that takes 22 minutes to only get the temperature down to
100 F is "broken".

The system you sell probably works just fine, but to work fine, it
_has to_ be drawing more than 2 hp from the motor.  Most likely, it's
in the 5 hp to 10 hp (12,700 Btu/hr to 25,400 Btu/hr) range.
