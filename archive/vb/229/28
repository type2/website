nope, exactly right. the heat path is some from friction, more from 
the oil that washes the cylinder walls and rocker areas, but mostly 
due to convection to the case from the heads/cylinders.
cooling the oil will help keep it from thinning, but not correct the 
original problem, which is too much heat stored in the head/cylinders.

i'd like to hear from those running extra oil coolers and see how 
often they change valves or replace pistons. i'm guessing they do it 
a bit more frequently than normal (flame suit on!) despite the 
cooler.  the extra heat exchangers may help the oil  cooling the 
cylinder walls and back of the piston shed just enough heat  to keep 
many engines JUST this side of the high-wear heat zone, but i imagine 
there is a pretty quick crossover point........
