Subject: Door strickers - where to get/part numbers?

Hi,

My bus is missing all the door striker/guides.  These are the little rubber deals on the stricker plates with the metal face.

I'm missing both front doors and the rear hatch strikers on my '66 bus.

If anyone has a part number or knows where to get these, please let me know.

Thanks,

....Markus
