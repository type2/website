Subject: BYOB - Updated Weather

Hey all,

Well, checking weather.com this morning and using the Red Barn's zip code (95004) it 
looks like there's still a 40% chance of showers Saturday.  Remember that BYOB'03 is 
a rain or shine event...we'll be there!  Just grab a jacket, a tarp, an umbrella...and come 
on out for lots of bus-goodness!  Show ramps up at 8am...runs until 1pm...we hope to 
have the gates open Saturday morning by 7.30am if not sooner.

-Taylor
