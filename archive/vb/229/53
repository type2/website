Subject: RE: [VB] Engine Oil & Cooling

Craig, I'm trying to locate the site and will soon find it again, but there
was a very extensive amount of research done on engine oil cooling and the
overall effect it had on engine life and the life of the oil. It was from
Lycoming and pertained to the 4 cylinder aircraft engine, but that isn't much
different then a mil spec Porsche 917 engine. In a nutshell, 20% of the
cooling came from the oil coolers.

i'd like to hear from those running extra oil coolers and see how
often they change valves or replace pistons. i'm guessing they do it
a bit more frequently than normal (flame suit on!) despite the
cooler.  the extra heat exchangers may help the oil  cooling the
cylinder walls and back of the piston shed just enough heat  to keep
many engines JUST this side of the high-wear heat zone, but i imagine
there is a pretty quick crossover point........
