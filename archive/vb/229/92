I will agree that, for a given working fluid, and given hot and cold
temperatures, there can be calculated a minimum work input to the
compressor for each unit of heat energy moved from the cold side to the
hot side.  Otherwise it would be a violation of the second law of
thermodynamics.

If forced, I will come up with numbers, but we're talking about
resurrecting themo knowledge over two decades old.
