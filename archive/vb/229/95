Subject: re:vent wing latches

was writ:
"Make sure you get a bus latch and not a bug one... they look identical
except the bus latch has a much smaller 'nub' that goes up against the
piece on the frame."

would this explain the vent windows that do not close completely? my
passenger side window rarely/never seems to close completely-causing an
uncomfortable load whistling noise on the highway. it only goes away if I
leave the window open a bit.

I think the Previous owner told em htat he had replaced one of the vent
window latches, maybe both. although I have always noticed that one looks
different than the other, I can't remember the difference right now...
