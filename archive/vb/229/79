I got my inertia reels, and the receivers from Lucas Valdes at PEP, <A HREF="www.peparts.com">
www.peparts.com</A>, 1 800 593 8787,

They were new units from a later VW, but I don't know which.
He has a mounting bracket that allows the reel to be vertical in its 
preferred location, but have the attachment on a horizontal surface (the seat 
stand).

The receivers that I choose were not on web belts but on flat steel bars to 
attach to the stock mount spots on my walk through. I supplied him with the 
preferred length of the steel bar so the receiver would be exactly at the V 
in the seat when I sat in it. He custom welded these. I then bent the bar a 
little to get the placement perfect.

He was very helpful when I contacted him.
He specializes in custom upgrades for older Porsches and replacements for the 
older Porsches as well.
