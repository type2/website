Hi Chris,

We offer air conditioning units made specifically to fit the split screen
buses:

Being that it is a Type 4 that you are putting in there, you will probably
need to either tweak, or make new brackets to support the compressor. Other
than fabbing new brackets, it has everything else you need for proper
installation.

Poor guys like me end up doing mods like this:

The wife complains about the water getting on her if I over fill it though.
