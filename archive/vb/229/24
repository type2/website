Subject: Engine Oil & Cooling

>From another list is this gem that might help 
in any discussions about engine cooling. Note
that there is nothing mentioned about oil. I
think that the cooling of the oil is to prevent 
it's breakdown and provide lubrication, and not
to directly cool the engine, but I could be wrong.
I'm many digests behind. What is the heat path 
to the oil?

"In small engine repair it states 1/3 heat is 
conducted through cylinder walls, 1/3 for power 
in the cylinder, 1/3 escapes in exhaust."
