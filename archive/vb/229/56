ok - now we have several options thanks to all of the folks out there.

Found a shop - Dan's Bug-Man in Templeton - that may be able drill the 
dowel pin holes - will find out tomorrow morning.  If this does not work 
we have an option of a local used long block from Randy in Arroyo Grande 
and we are looking for Ronnie's phone number. :)

Thank you for all of the help on all of the questions.  Internet access 
via cell phone is rough.
