I always heard one of the best ways to familiarize yourself with the
running of a VW air-cooled engine
(besides having one on to tinker with) is to grab a small engine & tear
it apart... Wrong?   Aaron

Don't be cheap! You can get a full blown (Blown) (Blown) VW engine at a
wrecking yard for 50 / 100$ and might have some parts recovery. I almost
always find one good head, good rods, crank for my investment.
If it has good heater boxes and a few other good parts you can E bay them
and double your money back.
