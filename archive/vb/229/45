B cases were sold in early bay windows.   If I remember right, they do have the factory threads for the bay moustache.  They I think are dual relief, BUT are the earlier alloy.  Meaning will warp/studs pull out sooner is abused.

I have used early alloy cases for years though/ and then when the heads went they didn't pull when I did a top end rebuild.   However, the warp factor is real, I'd pick a later case for building a motor up from the ground.  Though the B case I got with my westy is alive and happy in the 61 ( if it aint broke...)

When I was working at a shop downtown I did a rebuild on a H case.   It was worn, and the guy wanted the econo motor so the case was not sent to the machine shop (we didn't have the equipment to do that there)(bosses call, not mine)   Anyway, it turned fine (no power) before pulling it apart, but put it back together and there were issues because unbolting the halves allowed the hidden warp to surface.  It was a real PITA.
