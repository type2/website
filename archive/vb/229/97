I have a high temp heat gun I use for forming plastic and such and it worked
great on my daughters car. The type of film she had on her windows fully
released when heated and pulled slowly, glue and all.

Anyone out there have any special tricks to removing 10 year old window tint
film???  I just spent 45 minutes with razor blade and got about 6 square
inches of the crap off.  There must be a better way!
