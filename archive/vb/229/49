Hello All     This is bad luck alright. It can be drilled oversized and will 
work if the holes aren't  baddly ovaled. I get hardened dowels from the local 
bolt store and the correct bit for them just a little smaller than the 
dowels. can be done with the engine complete. you will also neeed to dress up 
the seating area between the crank and flywheel. This is what happened to 
kristin laurite's motor when she was broken down here at my shop before she 
was murdered in memphis tn. The other choice is to rotate 90 degrees and 
redrill back to stock size dowels, but I would get another flywheel and use 
it as a guide for drilling. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import
