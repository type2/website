Well, yeah, but for every recommendation, there's an anecdote to the 
contrary...
--------------------- Clip ---------------------
I blew the rings off #3 piston and drive 250 miles back home by adding a
quart of oil every 35 miles.
I considered  the engine trash but I resurrected it for another 140K, but
I bought new parts to do it.
It wasn't a road patch job.
