It will work, but the pilot light in the speedometer may not work
exactly the same as the original.  From later in the article:

In case you're wondering about the "exact functionality" part, it has to
do with the indicator light in the speedometer. Originally, this light is
on when the outside turn signal lights are on. If you use a generic
3-terminal flasher, the speedometer light will be off when the outside
lights are on, and vice versa. The #559 flasher has a separate set of
contacts for the indicator light, which lets you wire it to work exactly
as the original.

With the #550, you may also find that the pilot light in the speedometer
glows with the turn signals off.  A bit more rewiring will fix that.

NAPA guy is 0 for 2.  The pilot light circuit on the #550 works differently
than the one on the #559.  The #550 is designed for American cars where the
pilot light is connected between the flasher and ground.  The #559 matches
the original VW setup where the pilot light is connected between battery
voltage and ground.  As for the rating, the Wagner Lighting catalog says
that both #550 and #559 are rated the same: 2 lamps (-at-) 32 candlepower each
for turn signal (4.2 A) and 6 lamps (-at-) 32 candlepower each for hazards.
Both have lamp outage indication.

A 36 hp and a 1600 DP are both 4-cylinder boxer air-cooled engines.  :)
