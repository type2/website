Subject: BYOB'03 - Only 3 Days Away

Hey all,

First, the flyer and basic info's at:
http://www.sv2s.com/users/siliconvalleychapter/byob.html

Secondly, it looks like there might be a little wet weather this weekend for both BYOB 
and KP.  If anything, I have been hearing that it's a chance of scattered 
showers...nothing major.  Bring a tarp, bring a jacket, bring an umbrella.  But definitely 
don't stay home.  We (and KP) are Rain or Shine events!

Thirdly, Gabriel (the key guy) asked me to let you all know that he will be at BYOB with 
his gear...ready to cut keys and tumble locks!  So if you're coming out, get your work 
order in early with him at BYOB!

Hope to see lots of you (Thom included ;) there!
-Taylor
