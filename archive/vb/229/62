Subject: Wheels...

Is there a site with descriptions or pictures of wheels for Busses?  Sort 
of a "Wheels Through The Ages"?  I am trying to get both of my 67s rolling, 
and I have a pile of 15" wheels that I know aren't right, and might be good 
trade fodder.  Before I let 'em go for a song, though, I want to know what 
I have... <G>
