Subject: RE: [VB] Quality vent wing latches?

Make sure you get a bus latch and not a bug one... they look identical
except the bus latch has a much smaller 'nub' that goes up against the
piece on the frame... a bit hard to explain with words and I have no
picture.... I made this mistake on the vent windows on the double cab.
I thought things felt a bit tight when I went to latch the windows for
the first time.  Luckily, Greg Noble found his way into Eastern Oregon
one time and quickly pointed out my error.  (and to think I would have
taken the dc out into the day light in 2013 when it's finally finished
with such a gross error!)
