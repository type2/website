Subject: Re: Rebuilt Spindles and Center Pin!

At this point, I am waiting for my reconditioned torsion arms, and I will go
from there.

I found that much of the tightness in the steering is due to the fact that I
didn't ream the bushings of the center pin enough.  Since I am going to
dissassemble the shift rod to put new bushings on that, I will re-ream the
center bushes....providing I can get the pin out!

Live and learn...

Also, in the Bentley, there are markings for degrees, and also a " ' "
(apostrophe thing).  That is minutes, right?  How many minutes to a degree?
How the heck am I supposed to find something that measures minutes?  I do
have a 4' carpenter's level with a brain that displays degrees by
tenths....I can make standoffs and use that?

If the toe is what was causing me jerking and darting problems, and it was
set, reset, and triplechecked to be 1/8" closer in the front (rim to rim)
than the back...and this is what the book sez....what next?  If by the book
doesn't work for toe, then should I increase or decrease it?

p.s. King pins still won't accept grease, but they move smoothly...just a
matter of time, I suppose.  It was good to hear at least one success story
about Bus Boys' spindle rebuilds!

Thanks a billion...or bullion, if you want soup~
