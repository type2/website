Subject: RE: [VB] dished generator tin

Hens teeth from early baywindows. Start scounging the yards or hope for
list goodness and luck. 

...
It can be used on either a standard or doghouse shroud.  The dished
plate is a _bus_ part, since it goes with the 38A bus generator no
matter what kind of shroud it is bolted to.

So where can one get this piece? is it avaliable new, or just used?

thanks
robert
