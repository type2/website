If you build it yourself, get some long lengths of heat-shrink tubing to
cover the bundle. Use a heat gun carefully, don't over heat! Just enough
heat to shrink the tubing. I built my own harness during the resto back in
95, and heat-shrunk it front to rear. I didn't bother to reproduce the
original color codes, I bought 35 different colors of aerospace quality
teflon coated stranded wire, about 25 feet each, and bundled and
heat-shrunk them. Nothing will harm that harness ever. Teflon melts at
500F! Harness went in in minutes. Used it to wire the entire rear end, and
spliced the wiring up front into the existing factory mess up front,
leaving about three feet looped behind the kick panel, in case I get
ambitious sometime in this life, or begin to have problems in front.
