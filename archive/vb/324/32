Subject: Shipping needed soon

Ok, here's the deal. I'm starting to believe that nobody in the US wants to
ship a non-running bus from Florida to Norcal.

I'll pay anyone $1000 to bring me my new bus......If anyones coming out to the
Classic in a truck that would be ideal. The bus is in St. Petersburg, Fl. and
I'll pick the bus up in Socal if need be.

I still can't believe that this is happening. I've had three shippers back out
of the deal.
The bus is rollable but has a seized engine and no brakes.

If anyone knows someone that can get this bus to me I would appreciate the
help.

Please p-mail me if interested.

Thanks,
Dave Barnes
