My '71 came to me with a regular stamped pulley on its original 38A
generator, and it lined up perfectly with the crank pulley.  While I
can't say for certain that the pulley hadn't been replaced, it seems
unlikely.  The cast pulley might have been an earlier part not used on the
later generators.  In any case, the regular pulley works fine.
