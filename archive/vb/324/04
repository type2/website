Subject: anyone doing a wiring project?

i am wiring up an accessory harness, and have had trouble with the 
wires i am looking to purchase: to wit - one company wants me to buy 
100 ft of wire bundle, at a cost of $100+. another is willing to sell 
me the mere 20  ft i need, BUT at nearly $4/ft!!!

i am shopping for a 1 8-gauge, 2 10-g, 4 or 6 14-g bundle; if you are 
interested in going in on the 100ft purchase, let me know. serious 
inquiries only please... i have no budget for someone to kick tires 
and back out after i buy the crap :P

or, if you have extra wire bundle in the sizes above let me know......
