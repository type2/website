I think what Dave meant to say was Radar Electronics. I get a lot of my
wire and various piece parts for electronic projects from them. You
might also try the web for automotive wire.

I lived in Seattle at the time and I found quite a bit of wire remnants
at a place called 'Radio Electronics'... or something like that. Anyway,
it's an electronics surplus place that I was able to source all the
correct sizes and colors of wire.
