we need a petro engineer or physicist in on this one - does the 
GASOLINE expand, or does the increase in vapor pressure (basically, 
more gasoline turning into  vapor due to heat) FORCE the gas out of 
the filler neck etc. since liquids are incompressible, i'm willing to 
bet the increased vapor pressure PUSHING on the gasoline is the 
culprit.

i'm coming over to your house to put about 20 glass bottles of soda 
in yer freezer!  :)

I do believe the liquid gasoline itself expands... the vapour wouldn't be 
under the liquid gasoline pushing the liquid out the filler neck...but I think we 
need a Merck manual for this. 
 David Mayes?

on the bottles in the freezer..  water does expand when it freezes.  water is 
wierd in that it's denser as a liquid than a solid.  (most substances are 
denser as solids)   But what I said it there's not much difference in density 
between -liquid- water at different temperatures.  (~1% if I remember right????) 
That isn't comparing ice to water.
