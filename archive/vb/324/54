Subject: RE: [VB] correct height 15 inch modern tires

I just got new tire for my 70 but I have rims for a 55 on it. I ended up
going with a set of lemans A/T tires size 205/75/17 1600lbs max load.  The
guys where trying to find the correct size and a load range of C or D and
all they could come up with was Trailer tires like for a box trailer you
would  haul a race car in. I dont know if they would be correct or not, they
did say they where in the correct sizes and right load range. Just my input.
Oh and my tire ran 62.00 each.

Does anyone know what size radial tire will have the correct height when
used 
on a stock bus  15 inch rim.

the stock tires would have been bias ply tires and pretty tall, 

its going on a stock height 58 panel with  the flat wheel well arches

thanks for your help
