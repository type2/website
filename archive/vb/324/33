Hmm---

Cost me  a geester to get a 64 HO Bonneville wagon from San Jose to
Chicago--and it was running.

I think your a little short on the Denario's--

Fly down to the elephant graveyard --rent a truck and get it on your
own--

<<I'll pay anyone $1000 to bring me my new bus......If anyones coming
out to the Classic in a truck that would be ideal. The bus is in St.
Petersburg, Fl. and I'll pick the bus up in Socal if need be. 

I still can't believe that this is happening. I've had three shippers
back out of the deal.>>
