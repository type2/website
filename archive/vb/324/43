Greetings,

For those that are interested I have just updated pics'n'stuff
on the restoration of Leo, the trusty but very crusty Oz twin cab.

If you go to 

http://www.splitbusaustralia.com/Leo.htm

every pic the links to pics below leo_83.jpg are new.



Rob, you're a total guru with panel work. 

Most of the guys I know(even the panel beaters) would look at the rust & prang damage, shake their heads, shed a few tears & walk away.

A top job all round.

What else do you plan for Leo? An IRS or straight axle conversion? A beefier motor? Or will he be stock as in the drive train? What about that paint job?

Hopefully Leo will be ready for a trip up to the Aussie Nats next Easter, eh?

:o)

Cheers & God Bless
