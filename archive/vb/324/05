Thanks for the info...I was wondering about the possibility of Bus Boys not
lining up the king pin bushings...or now that you mention it, putting
undrilled bushes in!  I did line up the link pin bushings correctly, and
they take grease gladly.  I'll contact Bus Boys and ask...

About the shift rod...I was able to coerce it to move up enough so that I
could finish reaming.  The bushing or whatever that is supposed to go on the
rod as it enters the tunnel is either worn or missing...another project!

The white ring I was asking about goes into the swing arm at the base.  I
found the old one after I scraped encrusted grease and dirt when I was
cleaning the arm for install.

Now to get the toe-in set correctly so the bus does not dart around, and I
don't wear my tires out in the 22 miles to the alignment shop!

Thanks!
