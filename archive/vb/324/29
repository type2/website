I think the tight bushings are causing the wierdness. If you set the 
shims and the toe-in according to the instructions in the Idiot Book, 
then the alignment is done. The alignment shop won't be able to do 
anything you haven't already done.

I'd keep on puming grease and see if things loosen up. I'd also be 
working on Plan B in case the they don't. I wouldn't leave town in the 
bus if the steering isn't right.
