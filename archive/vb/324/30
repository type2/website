Subject: Help tuning, jetting, gaping, etc. for altitude

All,

I live in Denver, CO and I have a newer motor that I need to know how to 
tune for high altitude as well as how to tune for trips to lower altitudes, 
like Dayton, OH. Here are the motor details:

1915cc (117cu in)
40mm x 45mm big valve heads
94mm pistons and cylinders
110 Engle cam (intake opens: 19, exhaust closes: 12, exhaust opens: 55, 
intake closes: 48) (Valve lift 430, Running Duration 284, Gross Cam Lift 
392, Duration (-at-).050 247, Lobe Centers 108)
44 IDF Dual Weber carbs with 32mm Venturies
009 Bosch distributor with Pertronix Ignitor II

Here are the altitude details:

Denver, CO: 5883 ft
Dayton, OH:   816 ft

So, how do I figure (or what are) the settings for the following at the two 
altitudes:

Sparkplug gap
Valve Lash
Timing
Main Jets
Air Jets
Idle Jets
Emulsion Tubes

Thanks in advance for any help you can give.  I really appreciate it.
