the problem comes down to cost piecemeal vs bundle... several places 
on the web (and around phoenix) sell wire by the foot, but after 
adding up each size and length i am usually no better off than the 
cost of the bundled wire - plus i get to wrap the damn thing myself! 
:)
trailer companies here want nearly  $100, since they add in custom 
labor; most bulk wire sellers here won't sell retail. auto and 
hardware stores rarely have 8+ gauge, and then you  are back to 
nearly $1/ft.

that's why i am hoping someone wants to go in on the PREbundled 100ft 
spool - 3 people = ~ $35(-at-) shipping included.

part of my frustration is that i was SPOILED in austin - i lived next 
to 2 scrapyards (3, if you count the packrat neighbor) and 2 surplus 
houses. i could prolly find all the wire i needed just lying in the 
streets; heck, we'd find whole CARS abandoned by the driveway! sadly, 
they were all compacts, and none of the harnesses i stripped out of 
them are long enough.......

here in phoenix, by the time i find someone who has what i need, i 
face a drive up to 70 miles, so add nearly $10 for gas :P
