Hi Gene,
To get grease into any good condition king pins one must have the front end 
jacked up enough to remove the wieght of the VW off the front wheels.  If you 
already have done this then you should remove each zerk fitting and Q-tip out 
the grease that did get into there and see if the bushings were drilled before 
the king pins were pressed into place.  If no drilled holes then the spindles 
must be returned for disassembly and the bushings drilled.
