The DPO of my '64 didn't tighten the nuts all the way on the upper shock
absorber bolts.  This let the bolts slide back and forth and beat up
about half the thread on them.  When I got them out I noticed the heads
were marked "12K", which in modern terms translates to "10.9", a pretty
stiff metric bolt.  I replaced them with bolts from a junked Bus, that
were also marked "12K".

The ones at the hardware store are likely "8.8" or "9.8" bolts, which
aren't quite as strong.  I don't know for sure, but the stiffer bolt
might also be that little bit bigger around the shank.

I shimmed a bolt on the body end of a Panhard rod like this, but I
don't have any reliability data as the vehicle in question has only
traveled about 200 miles.
