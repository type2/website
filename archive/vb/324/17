Subject: RE: [VB] anyone doing a wiring project?

Ahhh, reminds me of rewiring the dash of my 75 scirroco... after a very
stupid mistake... but that's another story.

I lived in Seattle at the time and I found quite a bit of wire remnants
at a place called 'Radio Electronics'... or something like that.
Anyway, it's an electronics surplus place that I was able to source all
the correct sizes and colors of wire.  Search on the internet a bit and
you should be able to find some surplus outfit.

Now, the fun I had was obtaining some correct wire striping ink and then
I striped the wires as per the diagram :-)

Craig asked:
i am wiring up an accessory harness, and have had trouble with the 
wires i am looking to purchase: to wit - one company wants me to buy 
100 ft of wire bundle, at a cost of $100+. another is willing to sell 
me the mere 20  ft i need, BUT at nearly $4/ft!!!

i am shopping for a 1 8-gauge, 2 10-g, 4 or 6 14-g bundle; if you are 
interested in going in on the 100ft purchase, let me know. serious 
inquiries only please... i have no budget for someone to kick tires 
and back out after i buy the crap :P
