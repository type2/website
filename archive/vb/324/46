Hi Gene -

Don't know if this has been suggested to you yet, but I had very similar 
issues with my single cab after installing 15" wheels at the rear with 
larger tires, while leaving the 14" wheels on the front until they wear out.

This change in attitude, made the steering feel unsafe at any speed with 
sudden darting about.

The cure in this case was a careful front wheel bearing adjustment - making 
sure to snug them up to spec.  This essentially resolved the problem.

Nick
