Gasoline has a large expansion coefficient... ask any trucker.
You have to be concerned with both air and liquid properties.  With less
air pressure at high altitudes, you need to adjust the amount of fuel.


There is an older pamphlet that was published by Solex, 8x11 inch in
size, black cover with white graphics... covers 28pci, 32 pbic, etc.
etc. that has a few nice pages on altitude correction.
