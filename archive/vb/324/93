No, what's funny is when people who don't have dual carbs think those of 
us who do spend so much time on them. Just for the record, I don't spend 
any more time tuning my bus with dual carbs than I do tuning my truck 
which has a single carb. I rarely fool with the carbs on either one.

I like my electronic ignition too. 8^)
