Richard,

I suspect (and list, please correct me if I'm wrong) that the valve lash 
and sparkplug gap can be the same at both altitudes.

I don't know much about dual carbs though, or non-spec engines.

My guess would be that rigorous experimentation at both altitudes with the 
assistance of an emissions analyzer would be the way to proceed.  

List: Thoughts?
