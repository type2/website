Subject: Re: [VB] anyone doing a wiring project?

I bough a 20ft length of 14  4 cable for running accesories/ gauges.     I 
think it was about $10.  There were 4  14 guage wires encased in a sturdy rubber 
sheath, all diff colours I ran it from by the fuse box into the engine 
compartment of my 61 for oil temp/ oil pressure/ tach/ euro taillight extra wire.
