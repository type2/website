Subject: Toe-in Adjust (Rebuilt Spindles and Center Pin!) 

Ooh, how creepy!  The alignment shop (the only one in town) can't get me in
until next Wednesday, and I'd like to make sure nothing else is wrong before
we take our trip to Oregon, starting next Thursday!

I adjusted toe as best I could, as per Idiot's Guide, and then after doing
it 3 times, it seemed better, but getting the bus out on asphalt was
different.  Since the steering is really tight, (minus steering box play),
it is hard to tell what is going on...it seems like I have to turn the wheel
past center position to straighten out from a corner, and in the corners, at
a cautious 35 mph, I felt that the bus wanted to "dart" in the direction I
was turning.

I got to my flat/level asphalt parking lot, and checked toe again.  And
again.  Adjusted a little, and then drove around, then came back and checked
again.  I think it is better.  Not great, but better.  Then I adjusted the
drag link 1 turn to staighten out the steering wheel a bit, and drove home.

Still exhibiting signs of wierdness in corners.  Having to go past center
and then back to straighten out is still happening, and I don't care to
experiment with higher speeds in corners to see what that feeling of turning
too much too sudden really means.

I have done a lot of research, and I can't find anything that describes
this.  If the camber was off, would it do that sort of thing?  Has anyone
had this feeling?

Please advise...thanks!
