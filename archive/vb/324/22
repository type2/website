WOAH!! dude, i didnt mean to sound like a jerk, and if i did, im sorry i did. what i meant by you should go get the bus and put it on the road was, in my opinion, it isnt that bad of a bus from te pictures. i know you said for me to come get it, but i dont have the space or money for it either, i just figured someone out there might want it.
