Hi Volks,

Just 12 weeks to go before Buses Of the Corn 2004, and there's some 
news to spread: We finally have our very own internet domain name.

http://www.busesofthecorn.com has all the relevant content with none of 
the annoying yahoo/geocities pop-up ads. Many thanks to Steve Dolan for 
his generous assistance as web host!!!!

This weekend I will consolidate the history links and add a new page 
for Carabus Info. Right now I know of at least 2 carabuses (carabi ??) 
planning on coming in, and at least one heading from BOTC to the Dixie 
Bus Gathering going the long way around Lake Huron. If you are 
interested in posting carabus info on the site please let me know.

Another recent addition to the BOTC site is an update to the local 
information page. I have added a sizable list of local attractions to 
help lure more unsuspecting... no, I mean: to help people find more 
stuff to do while they are here.

Happy trails,
