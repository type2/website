Andy,
 
For the most part I agree. I don't see too many nice late models but then again I'm really not looking for them. My guess is a magazine with a 23 window on the cover will draw more attention than a '68 Deluxe cover would. 
I too am very bored with the Cal Look, be it on a bus or a bug. I don't buy too many magazines to be honest as I prefer all stock vehicles and though they are in the mags fairly often, most of the content leans toward custom cars. I have a lot of July issues of HotVW's! I find drag cars even more dull than custom cars. I was told that some of the DKP street cars are now turning 10's! That's pretty impressive but very dangerous considering most of them do not have cages in them. Anyway, Everett should be congratulated for his contribution to the hobby, though I think it has a little to do with why this list is seemingly getting more and more quiet!
