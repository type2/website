If I recall,it's just a matter of retarding the timing for higher
altitudes. On the rare times I've seen this discussed, it's been done by
ear. There's probably some official method or measure of engine efficiency
to do it more accurately, but I don't know of it. In the old days, when CO
was in my exploration routes, I don't recall ever really having much
problem, but that isn't a reason not to try and optimize your tuning.
