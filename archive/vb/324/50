hm.. I dunno about the camber issue... the VW spec for shimming the spindles 
oughto have taken care of that.. are you really very double sure you put the 
shims in right?   I've had 9mm offset and no problems

darting does seem like a toe in issue... I'd recheck it and give it a bit 
more toe in if neccessary.

did you do anything to your steeringbox?

a new swing pin shouldn't clunk.  i don't get it

when i got new tires & shocks on my bus, it drove very different.  very 
delicate.  I kept feeling like I was oversteering, but  there was no darting. I 
think I was just used to the worn stuff.   But I'd be better safe tha sorry if I 
was you.

when I had issues with my 65 westy... bus pulled ... i swapped out the worn 
clunky left spindle for a good used one and aligned it and all this shit, and 
it still pulled until I got good tires... one of the back ones had a tumor on 
the inside.  (Arnold says,  "It's not a tooma.").  just an idea... but it it 
didn't dart before I'd blame something you did rather than the tires.  probably 
the toe.
