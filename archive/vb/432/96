Subject: Re: [T2] Throttle Cable - Guide Tube Through Fan Housing

Rusty,

There is a spring and a hollow cylindrical part that fits over the 
spring and a washer with a slit which catches on the cable end.
Assembly is as follows:
1: thread the cable through the tube
2: slide the spring over the cable and the end of the tube
3. slide the cylinder over the cable and down over the spring.
4: compress the spring with the tube until the cable end is clear
5: slide the slit washer across the cable
6: slowly release the spring and tube until the slit washer catches on 
the cable end.

Your tube should no longer slide out unless you have quite the kinked 
cable.

Regards,
Chris
