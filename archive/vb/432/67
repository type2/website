Hi Steve,
If the bus is a keeper, just go through the DMV and get a three year temp
title.  Did this years ago with a nonrunner 59 bus.  Had to tow it to a state
patrol inspection site where we had an appointment.  Was required to have a
motor in it, so installed a dead parts motor.
The three years went fast enough!
