In Massachusetts, where I lived for 40 years, the Sales Tax
is figured on the sales price or the Blue Book value, whichever
is greater.  So is the Excise Tax, also known as the license to
park your car in your own yard.  Of course, if you live in Boston
or Cambridge, there is also the price of the Residential Parking
Sticker that allows you to park on the public streets that you
are already paying for anyway, but only in your neighborhood and
not others.  And the Inspection Fee.  And the Registration Fee.
And the License Renewal Fee.  And, at least in Cambridge, the Fee
for garaging a vehicle that is not registered if you decide to take
yours off the road in the winter and turn in the plates to save a
few bucks on the mandatory insurance.

Ah, memories,
