Subject: RE:Valve cover clips

Thanks for the tips.I tried drilling it out with a dremel..no go. That was
the only tool I could fit in there (after removing one heater box).

 

Eventually I just pulled the engine, and put the engine in  that I had been
prepping for my beetle. I've trying to get that running now.

 

I'll try some acid on the pin, and see if that opens the hole enough to get
the little piece out. 

 

The trouble with trying vise grips, and there is almost nothing to grab at
all. I've tried lightly tapping with a nail set, to loosen it up. Now that
I've got the engine out, I'll try some more stuff (like the acid). I have
heard of the bolt on covers-but was not sure what they bolted to? I have
also heard that they leak. 

 

Thanks and I'll keep you posted.
