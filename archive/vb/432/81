Subject: Re: Mirror Shade?

I've had one on my bus for over 12 years now.  I really like it.  It's a
simple solution. I did have to make one addition to mine.  I added one of
those small 1/4" clear silicone dots (the ones people use to keep cupboard
doors from slamming when they shut) to the bottom of mine.  This was
because the lights at night would glare off the plexiglass itself just as
if it was the mirror. This was my solution.  It slightly tilted the
plexiglass so it didn't act as the mirror and blind me (similar to e&b's
solution) ;-)
