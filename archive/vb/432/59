Subject: RE: [T2] flywheel?

Hi Mark I appreciate the info.the problem is I don't have a 12V flywheel to
test fit, I've been trying to figure out the type to buy.so I didn't have
anything to judge it by. 

 

Now I understand based on the info you sent, and the info from Clara et al.

 

So now I've got to order a 12V flywheel, non-stepped, ie the type that takes
an o-ring, which I understand is the standard type.

 

Next question.when I see these advertised on our regular VW vendors I see a
few different types-ie balanced, cast iron, forged chromoly, standard
weight, lightweight.

 

As I am not racing this engine, I just want a basic one-do I just get the
cheapest one?

 

Thanks again.I don't think I'd still be driving VW's if it wasn't for all
the help from the list all these years..actually I'm sure I would not be.

going to win at your NaturalBus event.I'm looking forward to it ;)

like I said bolt the flywheel up and then remove the gland bolt and see that
the flywheel is mated up to the crank.  later  md
