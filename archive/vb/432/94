Subject: Re: [VB] 66 single cab opportunity

Sorry about the delay, haven't been checking my email much lately.  
According to the monthly Old Cars Price Guide (the last issue that I 
could get was about a year ago) a 1966 single cab should be valued as 
follows:

1. Parts car (may or may not be running; is weathered, wrecked, or 
stripped; greatly deteriorated) -- $680
2. Restorable (needs complete resto but is not weathered, wrecked, or 
stripped; this car needs everything) -- $2040
3. Good (drivable; needs only minor work to be functional; a 'driver' 
that obviously needs a lot of help) -- $3400

I could go on but it doesn't sound like this pickup qualifies for the 
other ratings when the side gates are obviously missing.  The asking 
price of $6000 would be appropriate if this VW were a lot closer to 
'Very Good' condition, that is, a '20-footer'.

Too bad Borders went out of business, it was the only bookstore where I 
could find this magazine without buying a subscription.  When I got my 
classic car insurance for my VWs, I found that the company used this 
guide too!

Hi,
I found a 66 single cab for sale. Missing the side gates, bed is
rusted out pretty well and would have to be replaced. Frame looks
good. Body does not seem to have any bondo and only light surface rust
and only small dings. The battery tray looks good. Needs door handles
and rubber all around. Don't know condition of motor and trans. It
does have dual Kads.

What does the collective think would be a fair price these days?

Thanks!!
Chris
