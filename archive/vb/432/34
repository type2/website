Hi David,

Basically the concept is that you are looking for continuity. So you
need the wiring diagram or switch pinout illustration to see what pins
are supposed to be connected at each switch position. An ohmmeter that
beeps with continuity is a lot nicer to deal with instead of watching
the numbers wander around on a digital display or looking for needle
motion on an analog.
