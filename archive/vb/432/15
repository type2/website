Subject: (No Bus Content) Any list members good with MS Access?

So figured I'd ask even if I incur the wrath of god.  Spare me David...
 
Anybody on the list good with Access, specifically I need help to OCR an
already printed out paper form, search it, seize a section of text out of it
(name, address, phone number contact information) then dump said into a
database, Access I presume though I'm not wedded to it.
 
The last time I use
a database program it was the nightmare of dBase IV, no kidding.
 
I'll
include a little bus content.  I need to get the info together so I can have
money to buy more busses.
 
Thanks anyone.
 
John
