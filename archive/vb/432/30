 No.  Of course it would help to know year or part number of 1600 engine case
in question to be more specific.

The later "Type 2 Parts Reference Manual" is an excellent source of info for
comparing parts between the 1200 40 HP and the 1500 which is pretty much the
same as the early 1600s.  Later 1600s had dished camshaft, larger oil pump
passages, and of course the dog house shroud.

Are all 40 hp engine components (push rods, lifters, rocker arms, etc.)
compatible on all vw motors?? 1200 to 1600 40 hp motors.
