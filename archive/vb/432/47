Subject: flywheel?

I'm trying to resurrect a 6V engine that was in my bus and put it into a 12V
beetle. 

 

I've swapped the 6V generator for a 12V alternator. I've got a 12V coil for
it. I've got a carb that I think will work, and I have a 12V autostick
starter I was planning on using. I need to get a new flywheel, as the one I
have is 6V. I'm trying to understand what the correct type of flywheel to
get. It looks like there are a lot of options- I don't really understand the
difference. 

 

I vaguely recollect, that there are different types of seals for the
flywheel-some o-rings etc. So ideas on all the parts I will need to install
the flywheel would be appreciated. 

 

Thanks,
