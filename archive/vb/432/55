Subject: Re: [VB] RE: [T2] flywheel?

the difference between them is 6V is 6mm and 12V is 10mm   he  already has 
a 12V auto starter  so if he does have the 6V crank then by  cutting off the 
outter lip where the flywheel o ring goes it will fit. you will  then need 
to use the paper or metal gasket on the end of the crank instead of  the o 
ring, you should reset your end play  later  md

yes, flywheels can be

generally you find  6V stepped small clutch, and 12V o ring large  clutch, 
but there are other combos.    1500 engines used  large clutches, which did 
come in later 6V  split  buses.    I have even found a small clutch 12V FW.  
  

if the cranks is not stepped, you can use the 12V o ring large  clutch FW.
you can see a step at the end of a stepped crankshaft.  when you  have the 
FW off.  It meshes with the step on a stepped FW.

I found that using a mismatch FW and starter ends up working for a while,  
but chews up the FW teeth.   might as well match it up instead of  doing 
that.
 
if you swap the FW, do check/ reset endplay.   you may need to  adjust 
shimmage.
