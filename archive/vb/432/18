Hey Kevin,

Having been in your situation, somewhat, I took a welding class years ago.
It was focused much more towards someone looking to get into the vocation.
I welded lots of stuff together with a stick welder, and it was good to
learn, but when I told my instructor what I really wanted to learn, he put
me in the corner with a MIG welder and let me weld away. MIG is the way to
go.

As others have advised, a good helmet is worth its weight in Apple stock.
Or similar.

Ned
