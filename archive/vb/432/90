Subject: Valve cover clips

Hi guys,

 

Trying to do a tune up, and the valve cover clips are a real bear to turn.
Even after getting one of the covers off, the clip is REALLY hard to turn. I
am thinking I need to remove the clip, and somehow clean up the little hole
that it spins in? Or do I just need to get new clips?

 

How do you get these off? I've tried prying them out, and they don't seem to
want to come off. I don't want to break them.do I just pry like mad?

 

Thanks for any tips.
