Subject: Funfest caravan info...

Hi all,

Well, we're about 30 hours from heading over on Friday morning to Effingham,
IL for the MAM "VW Funfest" weekend.  For those who want to caravan over
together on Friday morning from the St. Louis area, feel free to join us.
Some of us wil be meeting at Ginghams restaurant in St. Charles for a hearty
breakfast at 9 am, and then at about 10 am, we will start out for Effingham.
I believe that we will be taking I-70 from St. Charles to I-270 and taking
that across the Mississippi River to where it merges with I-70 eastbound to
Effingham.  We will be taking it easy, travelling at about 60 mph or so.

Hope to see you either out on the road or at Funfest.  I'll be camping in the
camping area on the show site in my '67 Westy...drop by.

Bill Bowman
