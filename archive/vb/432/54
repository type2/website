yes, flywheels can be
-12V or 6V -  # of teeth
-stepped or O-ring
-large clutch or small clutch.

generally you find  6V stepped small clutch, and 12V o ring large clutch, but
there are other combos.    1500 engines used large clutches, which did come in
later 6V  split buses.    I have even found a small clutch 12V FW.

if the cranks is not stepped, you can use the 12V o ring large clutch FW.
you can see a step at the end of a stepped crankshaft.  when you have the FW
off.  It meshes with the step on a stepped FW.

This is a  picture from Jon Furst:

I found that using a mismatch FW and starter ends up working for a while, but
chews up the FW teeth.   might as well match it up instead of doing that.

if you swap the FW, do check/ reset endplay.   you may need to adjust
shimmage.
