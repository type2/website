Subject: stupid engine bolt question...

Well I'm still working on that engine swap. I have the engine ready to
go.and I am looking at the bell housing on the beetle. For some reason there
are two loose bolts sticking out of the bottom of it. As opposed to my
engine which has two studs there. All the VW engine work I've done has been
on buses, and those two lower bolts/studs have always been on the engine.
They slid into the two holes in the bell housing, then I would put two nuts
on it to secure it.

 

These two bolts in the bell housing are too long to be able to take out
without somehow cutting them. Because I'd have to cut the bolts, that makes
me think I should leave them there, and take the studs out of the engine. I
was also thinking maybe you had to do it this way because it is a beetle,
and if the normal bus studs were sticking out-then you wouldn't have room to
get the engine in.

 

So basically-should the two lower mounting bolts/studs be part of the engine
or part of the bellhousing. 

 

I assume the two top ones are always loose, and installed afterwards.

 

Thanks for some tips.hoping to get the engine in this weekend.
