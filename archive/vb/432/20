Subject: Re: [T2] re:Welding class

I have a smashweld180 Esab MIG, with a tweco gun.. and I weld into 200amps,
at about 24v doing the 5/8" and 1/4" ... but those welds are only 2" long,,
once i tacked a trailer together ,, all 10awg steel.. and then proceded to
zip along the 6ft seam.
That kicked out the breaker.. at the same time I noticed pourosity [sp?] ...
turns out I hit the limit on the 20percent duty cycle,, and melted the liner
in the gun. The liner slide towards the nozzle and cut off the gas flow..
That was the only time i hit the 20 percent duty cycle, and I do a fair bit
of production work.. very little tin body work.
The ESAB I have is excellent for body work tho.. as it has a spot weld
function, and a time on/off weld cycle switch.. almost welds like a tig.
and as for the helmet comments..... last time I did a job,, I was using a
new helmet,, nice fit, light,, tipped well.... but what I didn;t notice
right away,,, it didn't cover my neck line like my old one did.... so I had
a nasty sun burn on my neck!  I did smell that coming tho! ..  If you weld
in a reflective area.. you can burn the back of your ears... but that is
mosty in a production environment.
