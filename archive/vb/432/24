Subject: top post mount vs side post mount battery 

Is there any reason we use top post battery mounts in our VW's? Having had
to jump my bus and truck more than a couple times, from either leaving it
sitting for a while, or leaving the radio on.or it just being damn cold.I
think a side post battery mount would be much easier to access. If/When I
have to replace my battery in the future, I was thinking I might switch to
this style, but was wondering if there was a reason to not do this.
