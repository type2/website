So I will interject a random VW thought as well today.  Just got to love em.
 
Went to the storage unit where I have the '77 Westy garaged, figuring I'd
better finally (meant to 4 months ago) get around to pulling the battery and
bringing it back to put on a trickle charger.  Haven't started the sucker
since early October when I did at least fill the tank to the brim and add
Stabil (controversy I know, but I'll keep doing it.)  And I know, lazy, lazy,
lazy of me and all.  I figured the battery would be dead flat, if not dead and
gone.  So blew 30 minutes getting into my storage unit, digging out the
snowdrift, hammering open the sliding latch, then busting the ice sealing the
rollup down, etc.  Hop in and the clock is ticking (though since it gains 5
minutes a day, is way off.)  Figure WTF it has 15W40 Rotella in it, and it is
a balmy 20F today.  Fires up in about 2 cranks, purring strong.  I back the
ass end out, let it run about 10 minutes, give her some good revs once warmed,
and look at a way to hotwire the units
 overhead light to run the trickle charger (weekend project.)
 
Since she has
Hakka CQ's on her anyway I even think if it is over 30F next weekend we'll
take her out camping somewhere.  I love that damn thing, long live L-jet.
