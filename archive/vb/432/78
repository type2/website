Subject: Mirror Shade?

Has anyone ever used one of those shades that go over your rear view mirror.
I think WolfWest sells them. I always find it difficult driving at night due
to the headlights of the cars behind me causing glare off the mirror.I
usually end up closing my curtains, but I think it would be safer not to do
that.
