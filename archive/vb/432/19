Subject: re:Welding class

Well I went with the MIG class, and took it this past weekend. It was pretty
basic. Really a very intro class. The instructor spent a good 1/3 of the
class discussing safety issues. I think safety issues are important, but he
was going over safety issues on chop saws, pedestal grinding wheels, and
other tools-that were not part of what we were really there to study.

 

I got to practice a bit with the different machines. He had two different
MIG machines, different sizes.

 

Additionally one student had actually brought a flux core welder. I think
that is what it was called. It was like a MIG welder, but no gas. The
instructor showed us that it could be adapted/changed to work with gas. But
then he went on to explain that this particular model (from HD) was sort a
junky. 

 

Overall it was good, I understand the very basic parts of it.not ready to go
buy a machine. But I understand enough to whet my appetite.
