The lightened FWs are to make it easier to quickly rev a motor, so you can
accelerate quicker.    it's a go fast thing.
You lose momentum, so the engine slows quicker as well.    In a bus a
lightened fw is often not used, as you want the weight there.
Another reason is that if you have a full circle crank, often they weigh more.
Lightening the FW brings the rotating weight back to the same amount as
stock.

For a regular motor just get a regular weight FW.

Hi Mark I appreciate the infob&the problem is I donbt have a 12V flywheel
to test fit, Ibve been trying to figure out the type to buyb&so I didnbt
have anything to judge it by.

Now I understand based on the info you sent, and the info from Clara et al.

So now Ibve got to order a 12V flywheel, non-stepped, ie the type that takes
an o-ring, which I understand is the standard type.

Next questionb&when I see these advertised on our regular VW vendors I see a
few different types-ie balanced, cast iron, forged chromoly, standard weight,
lightweightb&

As I am not racing this engine, I just want a basic one-do I just get the
cheapest one?

Thanks againb&I donbt think Ibd still be driving VWbs if it wasnbt
for all the help from the list all these yearsb&.actually Ibm sure I would
not be.

like I said bolt the flywheel up and then remove the gland bolt and see that
the flywheel is mated up to the crank.  later  md
