Not may parts from the 40 hp work with later engines. They look the 
same, but that's about it. I think the rocker arms and shafts might work 
and maybe the lifters, but that's about all. You shouldn't use old 
lifters anyway unless they're in good shape, which they won't be if the 
engine didn't have an oil filter.
