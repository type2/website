Subject: 66 single cab opportunity

Hi,
I found a 66 single cab for sale. Missing the side gates, bed is 
rusted out pretty well and would have to be replaced. Frame looks 
good. Body does not seem to have any bondo and only light surface rust 
and only small dings. The battery tray looks good. Needs door handles 
and rubber all around. Don't know condition of motor and trans. It 
does have dual Kads.

What does the collective think would be a fair price these days?

Thanks!!
Chris
