Subject: RE: [T2] flywheel?

I was thinking the lightened flywheel had something to do with speed, but was
also thinking maybe it put less strain on the motor. Thanks for the
explanation. Anyway Ibve ordered a regular one, along with an o-ring.



Thanks for all the help.

The lightened FWs are to make it easier to quickly rev a motor, so you can
accelerate quicker. it's a go fast thing.

You lose momentum, so the engine slows quicker as well.    In a bus a
lightened fw is often not used, as you want the weight there.

Another reason is that if you have a full circle crank, often they weigh more.
Lightening the FW brings the rotating weight back to the same amount as
stock.

For a regular motor just get a regular weight FW.
