Subject: OT:  Anyone ever see/drive a Suzuki LJ-10

So one of these is for sale up here in the great white north, and I'm sort of
intrigued to go look at it.  Has a lot for the stalwart VW owner to love, air
cooled (2 stroke no less, a lot for the classic snowmachiner to love as well)
bizzare styling, sort of like a 2 door Thing or an Iltis.  An incredible
crawling/low range with a 5.667:1 final and a 3.013:1 low range in the
transfer case for a crawling ratio of 67.7:1 in 1st or reverse (needed it for
the power of the tiny 2 stroke, to spin 6.00x16 tires.)

An electrical system less complex than an early 60's bug, and absolutely no
creature comforts (not even a top.)
 
Sort of cool as hell I think, and
probably (I'm dreaming here and including bus content) towable with my '77
Westy when I build up the 2.2 that I've had parts for laying around for a
decade now.  The thing weighs less than 1400 lb wet, and is sized in the
Japanes "kei" class like the mini trucks imported now.  These are the
forerunners of the US Samuri.
 
Anyway, I know no-one follows anymore, but in
the day this is one of the kind of things I'm sure a fellow listee would have
owned at some point, hell maybe something a west coaster would have cross
shopped vs a Thing in the day (they were imported by someone in Oregon I think
for a couple years there in the early 70's.)  If anyone has ever offroaded
one, and would like to chat about it, give me a yell.
