Subject: RE: [T2] Re: [VB] stupid engine bolt question...

Thanks to all. I think your reasoning makes sense to me, and that is what I
was thinking, I just wanted to make sure before I cut the bolts out.

I'll leave the studs in the engine, and install that way. 

Ps-thanks for the prompt response, I'll try to cut those bolts out today...
