Subject: RE: [VB] RE: [T2] flywheel?

I think I am getting it.

I need to figure out if my crankshaft is stepped or not. I'm thinking that
since the flywheel I took off had an o-ring on it, then the flywheel I put
on should be the type that takes an o-ring.

 

I looked at the pics on the website you sent me to, and I can pretty clearly
see the difference. When I take my flywheel off, I see the part that has the
4 dowels sticking out. I thought this was the end of the crankshaft, but it
doesn't look the same as the pictures.

 

How can I see the end? I've posted a pic of the connection point of my
flywheel - http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/album_page.php?pic_id=913487

 

Or maybe I am reading too much into this. Maybe if I don't see a step, that
means I can use the 12V o-ring large clutch flywheel. Is that what you are
saying?

 

Thanks for the clarification.

yes, flywheels can be

-12V or 6V -  # of teeth

-stepped or O-ring

-large clutch or small clutch.

 

generally you find  6V stepped small clutch, and 12V o ring large clutch,
but there are other combos.    1500 engines used large clutches, which did
come in later 6V  split buses.    I have even found a small clutch 12V FW.


 

if the cranks is not stepped, you can use the 12V o ring large clutch FW.

you can see a step at the end of a stepped crankshaft.  when you have the FW
off.  It meshes with the step on a stepped FW.
