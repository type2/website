Subject: Check out my stove rig!  

Hello all!

I just finished making a custom stove for our '66 Westy that is similar in
design (but not nearly as cool) to Blue Nelson's Dormobile stove.  I had the
idea before I saw his at the Red Barn this year, but there's no way I could
even come close.  So I ham-handedly stuck this thing together, and it'll
work fine....it even looks sorta cool, but not the quality I had wished
for....oh well, I'm happy with it....maybe the next one will be "Robert
Davis Quality"

In my dreams  : )  Here's the link:

Ta Ta!
