If you can pull the bulb socket off the tach (like changing the bulb)
and the wires come with it and don't stay connected to the tach, then
yeah, these are the just the illumination wires.

Black one goes to ground (Bus body) and green one goes to the same
terminal on the coil as the wire from the distributor.  This is
a direct connection, not inductive.

Some tachs do need power to run and some don't.  Most of the hand-held
tach-dwell meters work just fine with just two connections, signal
and ground.  Tachs that need power to work are probably doing a little
more signal conditioning inside the tach.

I found these two links the last time this question came up.  These
are for VDOs but they may help.
