Subject: un-lowering(raising a rear-end and replacing two missing front springs) a '60 single cab

I have a '60 single cab which has been lowered both front and rear.  I have
the two springs that were removed from the front.  I need some guidance as
to the correct way to restore the original suspension height to my truck.
Any input will be appreciated.

Thanks

Geo
