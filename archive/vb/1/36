I bet the beer can broke off, fell down, and a PO tried to get in there
to fix and/or retrieve it.  In this process they graced you with a spare
Woodruff key, gave up, and put it all back together.  :)

Probably something like a 4mm thread.  You may not be able to find a
metric set screw that small but you should be able to find a regular
screw or bolt that will work...

Thanks for posting back and letting everybody know how it came out!
