I believe the 64-67 rear hatch is the same size as bays, or at least early 
bays.   I have seen a bay with a splitty rear hatch, and vice versa.   there 
is of course 64-66 the rear latch deal, and bays do have the rear window 
defogger -at least us spec bays do, but the size and mechabove is the same I 
believe.
