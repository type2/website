Subject: RE: [VB] EMPI Tach help

in a joking way, as not to be harshed out, i reply:
a good way to get it in your bus would be to open the doors and place it
inside, or put it through an open front door window. :)
are there any markings on the terminals on the back? that would be a good
way to tell which wires go where.
you could use a hole saw, hand grenade, hammer/chisel, even a natural
process like rusting a hole somewhere to mount it inside.
