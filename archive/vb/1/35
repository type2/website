HAR HAR HAR John.  Good one. :-)

Well the tach itself doesn't have anything on the back but 4 wires.  2 of
them go to the bulb socket (I guess this is ground and bulb power) and then
2 more wires come out of the tach.  One is black and grounded to the chassis
of the tach and the other one is green.  That's it.  I would guess then that
the green one is the feed for the tach but I don't know if this is supposed
to go to the coil, be attached to a wire wrapped around the spark plug wire,
etc.  I have no idea.  I though tachs needed power to run but looking at
this, it appears that needle will move just from the signal alone?  I just
don't know - an EMPI wiring diagram would be nice to have.

It's meant to mount in a beetle so in a bus you have to put it in something
external.  I'm not cutting a 3" hole in the dash and the only rust hole big
enough for it is outside on the driver's side rocker (and I'm not putting it
in there.) :-)

Dan Kinsey suggested a Campbell's soup can - and you know, that just might
work.  Might look clunky but then again, might look kind of cool. :-)
