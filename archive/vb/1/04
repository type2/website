Hi all,

I have a '59 Double Door Panel with the stock front bench seat.  The
original grey "wrinkled" vinyl upholstery is in nice, supple condition, b=
ut
the seam threading deteriorated long ago in several spots and the seams
have opened up.  Someday I may try to re-sew the original covers back up,=

but for now I'm looking towards buying a original style seat cover set an=
d
installing that in the meantime.

Can anyone with experience recommend a source of the best quality, closes=
t
to original style bench seat cover set that would be correct for this '59=

Panel?  Any upholstery tips or short-suts that you want to share with us?=

Thanks for your wisdom!

Also, does anyone know of a source for the rubber seal that goes around t=
he
window in the cab divider?  A few years ago I some NOS ones available, bu=
t
not owning a Panel back then, I passed.  Damn!
