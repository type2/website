Subject: Re: [VB] Good Starter Advice, Thanks all

about re-manufactured starters from AutoZone, $39 with a lifetime guarantee.
I called my local AutoZone up and they had one in stock.  Twenty four hours
later and I have a new starter in my '66, It starts every time!  So, I don't
want to sound cheesy or mushy but, I LOVE YOU GUYS MAN!!

Not cheezy at all John.  You'll find that by and large, the VW nuts are darn
near the most frugal automobilers on the road.  We're always looking for
deals and so forth.  It's great to know that because of the list, you save
enough money to pay for that internet connection every month. :-)
