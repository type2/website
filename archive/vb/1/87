Subject: Holy dirt batbus

    I will never ,ever, ever sand blast the floors of a bus again. Today my
helper spent 5 hours blowing out the sand and dirt from all the secret
little crevice's that are very well hidden in a bus. It was interesting
watching the hour glass run as sand kept pouring out the drain divots in the
rockers.  Besides the rat nest and spider colonies that live in the frame
rails, blowing through the jack points helps clean out the cross over braces
for the floor it was truly amazing at how much dirt collects in these areas
of a 41 year old bus. I have never paid that much attention to this before
as I have never thought of going this far on a bus, many thanks to Robert
Davis and David Mayes for giving me the inspiration (ya right) to go
overboard on the unrest oration of my DC.
   At least now I understand how easily a bus that lives in a wet climate
can rust from the inside out. So all you bus owners out there, CLEAN the
weep holes in your rockers, doglegs and your rear wishbone.
  I now have one clean chassis, now for the rust mort and paint, then time
to put back together.

ronnie,  why am I doing this?
