Subject: Re:[VB] un-lowering(raising a rear-end and replacing two missing front springs) a '60 single cab 

I too am going through this and this is what I found
out thanks for Ronnie and some others.
Three main ways to lower front:
1. Lowered King Pins (easy to spot)
2. Cut/Paste (look for cut/weld on torsion tubes
3. Remove springs (easiest and most common)
Rear end, if you still have reduction boxes, seems to
be limited mostly to just a re-adjustment on the
spline.
As for my front end, I ended up just purchasing a
complete drum-2-drum front end, in good shape for
under $200.  I have heard that just replacing the
whole front end takes about 25% of the time as
replacing the springs and is a surer bet.  Dealing
with the springs is sd to be a bitch.
This brings up another point.  Why can't people who
want to lower their busses (don't agree with it but it
is their bus) ask around for lowered front ends before
they hack away at a stock one?  I am sure I am not the
only one out there that has a lowered front end they
don't want or need!
