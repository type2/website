Subject: [VB] Intake valve stuck !

#2 Cylinder intake valve stuck open( noticed loss of power) Can I get out my
nail puller and a block of wood and pop that baby closed ? Or should I
remove the head ( stock 1600 DP) and take it to some one to figure out what
went wrong? About 1200 miles on the heads they were new .... Lloyd in
