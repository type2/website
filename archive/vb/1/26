Mesh Gray is the correct name, Salt and Pepper is the slang name for it.

Subject: [VB] Interior Colors


I recently acquired a very complete/origial 1966 Model
221 Std.  The colors are velvet green below and off
white above the belt line. When I pull up the color
charts on www.wolfsburgwest.com and register the bus
on Thom's site, it shows the interior as mesh gray. 
However, the interior is more of a salt/pepper seat
tops and middle of panels and dark green (ok, maybe
gray) on the panel tops/bottoms and seat sides/back. 
Plus, the piping on the panels is definitely green.

Question is, is this the "mesh gray" interior listed
to come with the exterior combo, or do I have
something else?  I ask because I need to reupholster
the front seats and want to get the right stuff. The
rest of the seats and door panels are fine and very
useable.

thanks
