Subject: looking for a good VW repair shop in N.Cal

Hey there,

I'm flying up to Rio Dell/Fortuna area to pick up a '59 kombi on the 13th of
August. Anybody know of a good shop in the area I could bring it too for a
little electrical work (blinkers, I think) and a quick once-over? Thinking
that I'll have to drive it down to San Francisco area, or maybe Sacramento
area to find someone, but hopefully somebody out there knows of a local shop
that's a bit closer. I wanna get at least the electricals in order before
the trek back home (Austin, TX!!!!); I can deal with the mechanical probs,
if any.

Thanks a bunch,
jesus v.
