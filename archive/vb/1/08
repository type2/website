Subject: EMPI Tach help

I just bought an EMPI tach - the larger one that measures 3" across - and
I'd like to locate a wiring diagram for it.  And since this tach is for a
bug, I need to figure out a way to get it into my bus.  Dan Kinsey has a
custom made stand for his which I really like.  I'd like to know if anyone
knows of any place that makes stands for tachs for buses or if anyone knows
of any off the wall place that might be able to help me out.

You can see a small picture of Dan's custom tach mount at

Thanks for the help, ideas, and brainstorms...
