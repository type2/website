good for you!!  :)   

ya- the engine should probably be taken apart and rebuildt- there is goop in 
there-  the case should be thouroughly cleaned- oil passages and all.    
Since it is the original motor, I would keep that engine case

ya- the idiot book is very good, and written for the average non mechanic.   
Do also consider getting the 63 bently book- written for 63-67 buses, the 
reprint of the factory book, is good for all sorts of details on the body and 
wiring etc.

well, sounds worthwhile to me.  and surely to many on this list.  so you 
found a good place for support of your strange habit.   I have done lots of 
work to keep ratty buses going.  sad, huh?

dont forget to grease everything that moves.  suspension, nuts and bolts, 
mechanisms in doors, etc.
