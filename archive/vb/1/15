Subject: RE: [VB] un-lowering(raising a rear-end and replacing two missing front springs) a '60 single cab

Geo,
I am doing the same right now. Depends how it was lowered in the rear. If
you are lucky, and have a redux box trans still, with stock components, the
spring plates might have been move up on the torsion rod/bar splines to dump
the rear. Just put it back and you are good. There are other ways that
ential non stock parts, which is what I am undoing.
Up front, I have no idea how you remove the springs and have a bus stil
stand, so someone else with experience in that area might help more, I do
know there are lowered spindles, which I have just removed to replace with
stock ones. I have also heard of heat weakening the front to lower it, but
again, I have no idea.
Detemrining exactly what they did will be very helpful in undoing it.
Chances are if they removed?, modified, cut, whatever the front, they dumped
the back by reindexing the spring plate, so all the money and major labor is
going to be up front..

I have a '60 single cab which has been lowered both front and rear.  I have
the two springs that were removed from the front.  I need some guidance as
to the correct way to restore the original suspension height to my truck.
Any input will be appreciated.

Thanks

Geo
