Subject: Polarizing new generator?

renoir here,

The diagrams i see indicate DF and D+ are towards the back when they really
are towards the pulley.

They say disconnect the regulator.

Hook D+ to the plus side of the battery.

Hook DF to some D- screw located on the generator body towards the pulley. I
do see a ground screw towards the rear
of the generator.

From the D- screw to the battery. Is this the right screw?

And to run for "HOW LONG"

Is this the correct procedure.

Thanks all.
