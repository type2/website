Subject: Re: [VB] Wilde Cam? (and engine story) 

Oh wow!  Thanks!  I think I had it all wrong, or at least a little
twisted...you may have saved my engine!

So, if I intend to use the 30mm pump, partially because it is there, and
partially because I feel that with both full-flow filter and external cooler
(I really like the option!) I will make use of the pressure...?  What
springs should I use?  What is the determining factor, and what is nominal
pressure in a 1600 mostly stock?

Thanks,

Gene
