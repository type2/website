Hi Diana,
Well that is a USA secret we are forbidden to reveal to you or you would have 
to have you shot!  :-)  If you can sneak down across the border check out a 
FLAPS for the Sta-Lube GL-4 85/90Wt gear oil bottles that come in one gallon 
bottle that is just enough for one bus tranny including it's RGBs gear oil 
change, and inquire about the pump that fits this size gear bottle.......     
Just make sure not to mention our names!

<<  Ahhh.. eau de gear oil.  attracts boys like flies.  not. >>

Sounds like you are trying to attract the wrong boys!  As in non-VW guys who 
would complain about the VWs you have taking up the yard!  They probably 
would be the types that would want you to be at home drooling with a vacant 
look in your eyes watching a Martha Stuart show on how to spend six hours 
making froo froos!    Eric&Barb
