Subject: Taillight Dilemma

I'm having trouble with my passenger side taillight on my 6-volt '66 Westy.
I noticed last summer that the taillight was very dim and the turn signal
and brake light were operating sporadically and they were very dim also.
When I bought the bus someone had spliced into the taillight wires for a
trailer light plug. I thought this might have something to do with it so I
dismantled the wiring for the trailer plug and removed it. No change. I
removed the taillight and found that the plastic fitting into which the bulb
screws was broken. I bought a new taillight housing from Ronnie and wired it
up. This hasn't helped.
When I took the taillight out I saw that there are two red and white wires
spliced together for a common female plug. There is also a striped black and
white wire plus a wire that leads to the license plate light fixture. There
are two prongs and a ground prong sticking out from the taillight housing.
The way it's wired now, when I turn on the turn signal all the lights in the
back blink very slightly. What am I doing wrong???
I've looked at Thom's wiring diagram plus the one in my Bentley manual and
I'm sorry to say that I haven't been able to come up with the solution.
The driver's side taillight is much brighter and the turnsignal and brake
light work as they should. I haven't had someone available to check the
brake light on the passenger side yet.
Any suggestions?
TIA
