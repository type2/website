Yes A.J. - it's been tested and tried.  When you have rusty nuts and bolts
that just won't budge and you don't have access to an impact wrench, heat up
the part in question and shove a block of parafin wax on it.  As the part
cools, the wax is drawn into the threads and lubricates it, reducing
friction and heat.  I've never done it but it was an idea that Bill May of
the VintagVW list mentioned a few years ago.  I've done my best to spread
the word about it - evidently it's a damn good tip.
