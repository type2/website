Hi Shawn,
Make sure she installs a third stiffener hook in the forward middle grommet!  
VW did not do this and the original tilt.  It always popped this center 
forward grommet loose and poured rain into the bed at speeds higher than 
30MPH.  Also make sure these grommet hooks are made out of a stainless steel. 
 The stock two of these were made out of painted steel and tend to rust from 
the fabric holding any moisture against them, which attacks the fabric with 
the sharp oxide crystals of the rust as the fabric moves/flexs.
