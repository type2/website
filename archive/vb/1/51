Hi Gene,
Just be carefull not to use too big than stock pump or else the pressure will 
always be way too high and not allow the pressure relief valve/s to close.  
This is especially bad due to the pressure relief valve does not close and 
shunt the oil through the cooler even though the oil is running super hot!
