Subject: Re: [VB] un-lowering(raising a rear-end and replacing two missing front springs) a '60 single cab

Clara(lw(-at-)aol.com) elevated my 63 singlecab to the correct height.

She put correct springs in the front & repositioned the rear splines tpo set the rear correct.
It all worked out great.
Contact her for specifics.
