Pretty sure they are 6mm.  Another option is to get a step-stud which
is a stud that is bigger on one end - the one for this application is
6mm and 8mm.  You drill and tap the case for the 8mm end and just screw
it in, leaving a 6mm end sticking down.

If at all possible do the drilling with a variable speed drill on low
speed or even a brace and bit.  The case alloy is very soft and will
"grab" at your drill bit.  My Dad did this on his Bug and wasn't 
ready when the case sucked in the drill bit so quickly...the hole
ended up usable but a little crooked.

Kyle's idea of putting a bolt in from the top also sounds pretty cool.
I wonder if it would be a good idea to put just a touch of Loctite or
maybe RTV on the bolt threads before threading them in, against 
loosening and leaks.
