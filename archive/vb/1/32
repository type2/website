Ug.  I know the smell well, unfortunetly..

Ages ago our great dane got hungry while tied up at the foot of my bed.
(this was probably while the doors were off the bedroom hinges for some
reason, and company was over...he liked to use company as a chew toy)

Anyway.  He ate the corner of my matress.

Some time later, apprently a mouse crawled in and made a home....and
eventually died.  Everyone thought I was crazy when i first mentioned the
smell, but it eventually became strong enough that everyone else noticed
it too...we soon determined it was the matress and chucked it out the
window.

For exploratory purposes we cut the thing open to find out why i'd had to
toss my mattress out the window...and yup. Dead rodent. Ewww.


ObBus:  it still stinks. I just drilled holes in the studs in the shop and
pulled romex down to the new location of the air compressor and got it
usable again. (the front tires of the Quantum are both leaking a fair
piece and I need to put air in before i drive to get groceries....and i
obviously cant take the bus!)

I may crawl under and pull the heater tubes off the boxes and tape off the
vents, change tips in the blowoff tool, insert, and see what comes out....

anywho.
