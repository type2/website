 Hi John,
 If you wiring is in good condition with all repair connections soldered and 
heat shrinked over.  Plus the voltage from the battery to the front through 
the fuse box and back to the lights with less than .5 volts or hopefully less 
voltage drop.  Then you need to attach a grounding wire to both tail light 
bulb holders and run the end of this ground wire to the battery grounding 
strap.  This is the only way to properly ground the tail lights and was 
finally done stock this way in 1971!   Eric&Barb  >>
