Hi Erin,
Until you take it apart or tach/RPM it or use the rear wheel ratio turning 
system you will never know.  Was it NQ that had figured out this last system?

<< 2) If so I am planing to swap 4.125 , my current engine is a 1.6 single

 it result worse ? I am not planing to load anything heavier than 500 kg

Worse what?  If your tranny you have in there now is the same the results 
will be the same.  If lower geared it will be a bit slower off the stop sign 
to 55MPH, but better at doing highway speeds with good engine longevity and 
MPG as long as you do not over rev it.

<<  3) Did anyone try an external oil cooler adapter which mounts under the 
 original oilcooler ?. If so does it serially add the external cooler after 
 the original one or before it ?  >>

We use the type 4 cooler in the type 1 & 2 doghouse tin.  Definitely helps us 
keep the engine cooler and more stable from oil temps over 220F.  Still you 
have to watch your RPMs and adjust them for better cooling if really hot 
outside and hill climbing with heavy loads.

<< 4) The oil-temp seems to increase easly over 120 C ( 250 F) I am not 
feeling 
 happy with it , is it normal ? >>

Normal if you over rev it, out of timing, badly carb jetted, have missing 
engine tin, wrong size cooling fan or lower pulley, missing engine or engine 
lid seals.....  Best to keep it between 160-230F and we prefer to keep our 
top temp down to less than 220F for better engine longevity.

<<  5) Can 0.82 4th gear be fitted to a bug ? my bug has 0.92 with 3.88 , 
0.82 
 can be cool with 1776 , 100 hp .   >>

Yes!  It is called the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia.  Our 63 KG does 1,500-3,000 
in second gear 15-30 MPH, third gear 30-45 MPH, and fourth gear 50-65 MPH.  
At 45 MPH in third you have to look around and make sure you have no hard 
hill or thick traffic ahead.  Then floor it up to 3,500 or 3,700  RPM (The 
higher RPMs when going up a bit of a hill) in less than 15 seconds and shift 
into the bottom of fourth gear at 50 or 52 MPH.  Then give it a bit of gas to 
ease it over 55 if traffic and all allows.  Eric&Barb
