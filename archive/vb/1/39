Subject: Determining gear ratio

All,

After thinking about the "gear ratio" discussions I wrote this in a
post recently.  Does this sound about right or am I missing something?

---
The overall ratio will be somewhere *around* 4:1 to 4.5:1.
I think the procedure for figuring this out goes like: shift into
4th gear, put the back of the Bus up on jack stands, and release the
parking brake.  With the key off, turn the engine with a wrench until
the timing mark is lined up - all you need is a point of reference.
Mark one of the rear tires at "12 o'clock" with chalk or tape.  Then
go back to the engine and start turning it over with the wrench,
counting revolutions and checking the mark on the tire periodically.
When the tire has made one complete revolution, stop turning the
engine - the number of turns you have made tells you the gear ratio.

Thanks!
