Subject: Lighted "D" oval...

I'm not sure if my "hello" message went out, with the server issues and all, 
but I'm the new guy on the block. I bought a '60 DD Panel through Ronnie and 
have been loving every minute of it!

Anyway, to my question. I saw a picture of a rear "D" oval that was 
illuminated from the inside, but I can't remember where it was.

Anybody? I'd love to find one (or at least the photo)...

Thanks,

~Rich Barker
