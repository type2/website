actually it is not too bad.  I would much rather replace springs than a beam. 
  There should be a blow by blow description of unlowwering the front of my 
Dad's SC in the archives- it was a few years ago  (3?)    it took an

that the front end was so jolty that he would hit his head on the roof!!!!
