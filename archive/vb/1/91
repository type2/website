Nope - that wasn't me but if I recall, it involves spinning the engine and
counting the number of turns the engine goes compared to one complete
revolution of the rear wheel (making sure to block one side so it doesn't
spin too and screw up your count.)  Knowing what your reduction boxes are
(mine are 1.26:1) then you can calculate your gearing.  I have a freeway
flyer with the 3.88 gearing in it.  I still haven't actually sat down and
figured out what my bus's overall gearing is compared to an 091 trans in a
bay window.  I need to so I know what kind of performance I'll have with
this T4 2L.
