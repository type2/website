Hi NQ,
On the tachs we use there is a common ground wire for both the tach and it's 
interior light.  White wire for the positive for the light.  Red for positive 
wire for the tach, and green to go to the #1 (negetive) side of the coil.  As 
for mounting the tach is one gauge that is needed only for about a fifteen 
minute drive to figure and write down where the RPMs (Especially 1,500 & 
3,000 RPM) are in each forward gear. 
  Make sure your coil is connected up correctly even if you are not going to 
run a tach!  We just recently help an old friend with thier bus not running 
well and starting worse.  After cleaning and tightening two electrical 
connections and correctly switching the two slip on wires on the coil all ran 
well.
