Subject: Sandblasting Round 2

Blasting begins bright and early this morning.  Using #80 garnet I will be 
attacking the front floor and the grooves that the kick panels slide into as 
well as the corners of the rear floor where it meets the side panels.  Also I 
should be finishing up on the roof window blasting as well as the inner 
channel above the side windows on the inside. 

I was able to get most of the passenger area sanded down. Got the sunroof 
assembly torn down mostly and will be looking into restoring it next weekend. 
Blasting the bows and painting it before the new material and guides (maybe 
this would be a good spot for some POR15?) Anyone have some tips on 
installing the material? Headliner, straps and cover.

Tonight ill be putting up some pics on either thom's or everett's website.

Stay tuned.
