Subject: Re: [VB] Oil plate thread size

George,

I couldn't tell you. Everytime I've done it I've cut them to length. The
hardware/auto parts store down the street has a modest assortment of metric
stuff and I've always just bought the nearest longer one and ground it
shorter and cleaned the threads with a die. The selection of grade 5.5 stuff
there only runs in 10 mm increments so you just have to make do. the one
holding the oil pickup is a tad longer anyway. I use one of the studs as a
guage when grinding them, so I would assume that would be a dandy thread
length to go with.
