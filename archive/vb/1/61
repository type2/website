Subject: Re: [VB] Wilde Cam? (and engine story) 

Unless you installed more bearings for the pump to oil, all a larger pump
will do for you is rob horsepower at best. It will starve the engine for oil
at worst. High pressure and high volume oil pumps work best for keeping the
folks that make them employed, and they don't even do that any better than
the stock ones. A blueprinted stock oil pump can produce way more pressure
than the relief valves will allow, and delivers enough volume to supply all
of your bearings. The relief valve(s) and the amount of wear in your
bearings determine oil pressure, not the pump. If your pump is delivering
excess oil and it is dumping through the relief valve into the sump, has it
improved anything? No, the opposite most likely.
