Hello Again   =20

    Would anyone have a spare carb linkage? The setup I need is a =
straight bar linkage. I have the carb plates and filters but I just need =
the bar and arms that attach to the bar that connect to the carbs. On =
the Dell's I have the adjustable swivel arms that attach to the linkage =
arms. This is my first set of duals so I hope this is enough information =
to get me started on what will work with these carb's.

Thanks
