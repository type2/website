I've had the same fun with mine.
Last time I pulled the engine and trans out as a combo, fixed it and put
everything back in.
Monday water cooler conversation went something like
"how was your weekend"
"got a lot accomplished, had to pull the engine/trans on my truck to fix the
xyzzy"  (i forget what i was working on)
"oh, too bad, that must have killed the whole weekend."
"no, not really, had everything back together by midafternoon Saturday and was
able to..[fill in what ever it was I was able to do over the remainder of the
weekend]......"

We may get grief for driving these old things, but at times like that, it's lots
of fun to see their reactions.
