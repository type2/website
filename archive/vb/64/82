Subject: Re: [VB] The intricacies of oil cooler seals...

parts list late splitty ed shows only one version

111 117 151

which in canada in 1957 cost 4 cents each.

seems the same version was used through H case motors, its not 36hp specific. 
 its the standing up tube kind I believe, not the kind with a skirt, and if 
you have old gaskets kits you should have some, the old seals will be fine to 
compare from.

I have always snugged the bottom two nuts first, then the top one, and round 
another time final torque be what 7.5 or 10 ft lbs, they are only 10mm like 
the oil drain nuts.
