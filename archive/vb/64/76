Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel pump rod.

if you have recently replaced your fuel pump ( im 
assuming you have ) you might want to try the longer 
type pump rod. I have ran into this problem a couple of 
times. i dont know what rod goes with what pump but if 
the pump dont work after i replace it i install the 
longer rod. jsut go to a junk yrad and take one out of 
any motor ( vw of course ) and compare it to yours. 
there is about a 1/2" differance.
