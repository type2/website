Redoing the door panels in my crew cab.  I ordered the Wolfsburg West =
replacements but they don't come with the pockets.  I'm pretty sure I =
could build some to look like the original but I need a pattern.  Can =
anyone give me some dimensions to locate the pocket opening?  How about =
loaning me a pocket to copy? =20

Thanks,
Dan
