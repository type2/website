Subject: What's that black flaky stuff on my brake shoes??

<<as I told my wife the social worker, its time to talk to my support
group>>

Over the past few weks I have noticed an occasional grind on the front
passenger wheel.  It had happened most often in the AM so I was thinking
that it was probably associated with AM mositure (I live in FL).  More
recently I noticed that the bus would pull (again occasionaly) to the right.
Today I started trying to figure out what it could be, thinking that the
brake and wheel bearing job I had done 9000 miles ago (first ever) had gone
wrong.  I was almost expecting that the hub would be shot.

When I pulled the hub it was just fine and there was plenty of pad.  However
there was this black flaky substance all over both pads.  I was able to
clean it off.  I also checked the brake cylinders which I replaced 9000
miles ago and they were fine as well.

What was that black stuff??  Could it be that I didnt get the bearings in
tight enough and grease got in there?  Did I put too much grease in there
(remembering that this was the first time I had ever done something like
this before; it was me the garage, the idiot book and the list)?

I also noted today that the tie rod on this side is in bad shape and will be
getting replacements in the next week or so.  Could the really bad tie rod
have something to do with it??

I am going back out to the garage and hit the idiot book.  Any thoughts from
the list would be greatly appreciated.
