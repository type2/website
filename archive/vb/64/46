Subject: vintagebus porn amazement

ok, we all know Thom's vintage bus sight is really about porn, but if you
click on the 'porn' most popular search tag, you get a picture of 9 nuns
(fully clothed) loading up into a deluxe.... go figure.  Maybe there's a
special key you press and their robes fall off?
