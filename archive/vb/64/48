Accidentally deleted future posts, so not sure if the question was
answered, but the adapter for the late splits goes on the wiper shaft,
and the wiper screw to it.  The half moon cut out goes into the springs
on the wiper arm.  You will probably have to bend the arm a bit to make
up for the difference between it and the windshield.
