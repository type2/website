Subject: RE: [VB] Early Door Panel pocket info needed

I just uploaded some pictures of one of my door panels that show the pocket
and location.  Rob Davis and I went through this awhile ago but I have yet
to cut my panels from BFY... I'll use my og pockets and rivets with the new
panels unless I can find some nice og panels (hint hint anyone???)

search vintagebus.com gallery for me 'David Mayes'

Redoing the door panels in my crew cab.  I ordered the Wolfsburg West
replacements but they don't come with the pockets.  I'm pretty sure I could
build some to look like the original but I need a pattern.  Can anyone give
me some dimensions to locate the pocket opening?  How about loaning me a
pocket to copy?
