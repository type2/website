Subject: Fuel pump rod.


After checking the float bowl in the carb, no fuel
there?

removed gas line & gas is flowing from it,...so fuel 

pump is my guess, question is? the pump I bought from 

the FLAP is different than whats on there. 

not able to take that one apart, the new one has
screws

around the top.

Will the pump rod I have work for either type of pump?

thanks!
