Actually, you need a die. A tap is for threads in a hole......

It is very fine. You will probably only find a thread file available. It is
designed to 'file' the threads to repair them. Make sure to use a metric one.
Your 67 should have 2 nuts with a lock plate between them. Horrible system.....
Got any self-serve wrecking yards near you? Go get 68-79 bay window bus nuts.
They are the clamp style with an allen bolt.
