Subject: Air, Heat, & Motor for Sale

Hi all,

Get your PRIDE and JOY ready for all climate contingencies!!

I have three items for sale that I thought I would offer to you all before 
heading to Ebay. First is air conditioning for a 71 or earlier Bus, second 
is heat for 71 or earlier bus or 1600+- Bug, and third is a stock 1600 
motor.

AIR CONDITIONING
The Air conditioning is a new, never used, complete kit, soup to nuts, 
including compressor, brackets, pullies, hoses, mounting hardware, fans, 
evaporators, condensors, etc. etc.  It is made by International Conditioning 
Enterprises (http://www.iceac.com).  They make custom and sell aftermarket 
A/C kits for a number of import cars, and have been in the business of 
putting A/C into aircooled VWs since the '70s.  I bought the kit for a 
project bus that I recently had to sell, so my loss can be your gain.
PRICED TO SELL: $650.00 + shipping. (originally paid $1020.00)

HEAT
A soup to nuts stock heating system for your 1600+- bug or bus.  Includes 
Dansk H/D heater boxes, insulated heater-to-body hoses, fresh air hoses, 
lever kits, installation kit, seals, etc. etc.  Also BRAND NEW and never 
used.  Bought for the same bus as above, and again, my loss can be your 
gain.
PRICED TO SELL: $125.00 + shipping (originally paid $175.00)

1600 MOTOR
I also have a well used 1600 motor with dual baby webers (34 ICTs), hex-bar 
linkage, (new) 009 distributor w/ electronic ignition & Blue coil, 
mechanical fuel pump, (newer) generator, oil cooler, shroud & fan, and all 
tin except for the upper cylinder tin and lower air deflector tin. This has 
been lying around for a while since removed (6 mos), and I would just like 
to get it out of the garage.  This will be for pickup only, so if you are in 
the Denver, CO area and have an interest . . .
PRICED TO SELL: $325.00 for the whole shee-bang.

Write to greymatters(-at-)hotmail.com if you want to purchase or haggle.  I will 
sell the whole lot for $1000.00.  Certified checks only for all purchases.

Take care, all


Richard
