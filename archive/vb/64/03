Oh yeh, reminds me of last time I pulled the engine too. One of my 
co-workers wanted to go for a ride in it. So on the way to lunch I told 
him, "yeh, I pulled the engine yesterday to fix...." . He looked at me kind 
of scared.."In THIS". I said, "yeh". He kind of stiffened up and held on a 
little tighter to the side of the seat. I just had to laugh.
