Subject: Spindle threads

Any help would be appreciated.  I took off my drums today to check my
cylinder, and the previous person who did this mangled the threads when they
put it on.  Now I need to, if I can, find a tap for the spindle to try and
repair the threads or replace the whole spindle.  Does anyone know what the
thread size is on a 67 front end spindle and if I can buy that size tap?
Does anyone in the San Jose, Ca area have an extra right side 67 spindle nut
that I can buy?

Thanks,

doug
