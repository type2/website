I too have the same rattle and need a spring (after Mathew gets one of
course). I am game for any other ideas too! I have tried taping the
bezel and other things...

Anyone have an extra inside cargo door bezzle spring?=20
I need one for my 65 deluxe.  If it makes a
difference, the bezzle is chrome, not plastic.  I am
tired of hearing it rattle.
