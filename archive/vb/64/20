Subject: plasma cutting

   Yesterday we started to cut up a 59 panel I have had for a while with my
new Plasma cutter and all I can say is yahhh. After cutting out numerous
other pieces with a torch, nibbler, air can opener, cut off wheel and metal
shears all I can say is why did I wait so long, Nice clean small cuts, no
panel warpage and 10 times as fast as any other method I have tried.
