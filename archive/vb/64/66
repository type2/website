Subject: broken head stud on new rebuild

Executive summary: SONOFABITCH!

Situation: New stock 1600 "rebuild" using mostly new parts
including new case, p/c, crank, etc. Did the 20 minute run-in
procedure per Wilson, no apparant problem. Oil pressure and temp
were monitored the entire time and were good.

Let it cool down overnight and went to adjust the valves before
hitting the road. To my horror, one of the lower head studs had
broken off near the nut. I was able to get it out without pulling
the head, so theoretically I can replace it and be back in business.
But do I dare?

I was very careful about torquing the heads. I followed the
Bentley procedure, torquing in stages and even alternating heads
to avoid uneven stress on the case. Unless my new torque wrench
is horribly off, I did not exceed the spec torque.

Does one occasionally get a bad stud that breaks the first time the
engine
comes up to operating temp? If so does one freak out and tear the thing
back to the longblock stage? Or does one replace it and go? "Keep on
coming or stand and wait, with the sun so dark and the hour so late?"
