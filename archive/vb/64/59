Top books that I actually own: 
The '63-'67 Bentley manual reprint.  Plus the color wiring diagrams from
  vintagebus.com .

The Idiot manual.  Yes, it has mistakes and statements that people
disagree with.  I still think it's a good reference and one of the
best examples of technical writing for a non-technical audience I've
ever seen.  Another thing I will say in its defense: It was first
written in 1969 and revised in 1977, and so makes certain assumptions
about the continued availability of parts and competent dealership
service departments.  Some of these assumptions have since become
invalid, which makes it harder to follow some of the procedures.

"VW Transporter, Die Technische Dokumentation 1950-1990" by Stefan
Doliwa.  As far as I can tell, it's about as close as mere mortals
can get to the Bus-related info in Pr*gr*ss*v* R*f*n*m*nts.  (Only
members of the Secret Vintage VW Literature Cartel (tinsvvwlc) are
allowed to read P- R- (tinpr).)  It's in German, which some people
don't like but I think it gives it 20 extra "cool" points.

"VW Bus, the First 50 Years" by Keith Seume.  Some people lust after
a RHD Deluxe; others a double-sliding-door Kombi.  Personally I think
the coolest "pure Unobtainium" Bus to own would be the Strahlmesswagen
in that book.  Lots of dials and switches and tubes and knobs...

Online references (I don't have hard copies): 
The '67 edition of the Bus parts manual.
The Type2/VintageBus/Vanagon mailing list archives. 

Books that I would like to have:
As I understand it, the reprinted Bentley is an abridgement of some
larger manual set that VW used.  It'd be neat to have the big manual
set, if it exists.
