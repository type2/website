Howdy All,
Looks like the gas heater I picked up for my 71 Westy (thanks again Will Anderson) is going to work out for me.  So I am in the position of Trading or Selling my 83.5 Water cooled (and heated!) Vanagon with a Westy package installed.  I bought the Vanagon only so I would have a vehicle with heat in the winter time, and now I can drive my nice, simple, carburated, gas heated, 1600 bus all year.  The vanagon was originally a sunroof passenger van but I put in a complete westy package including poptop. Its actually pretty cool, you slide open the sunroof to get to the top bunk area, and then slide it closed when you're not using it.  Anyway, I'm looking to trade for nice running reliable bug or other aircooled vw, or sell outright for $2K.  Info and details are at Everetts site  http://thesamba.com/vw/classifieds  in the bus 68 and up for sale category.





Peace, John Baker
