Subject: RE: [VB] '59 Kombi...one night engine pull

When I sold my side loader, the new owner wanted a bigger engines and  FF
trans, so, we pulled my DD in the shop, pulled the side loader in behind it.
Me and my co-worker started in on a double engine and trans swap at around
noon and by 5 in the afternoon we drove both buses out. Two people, hoist,
air tools made things go fast.

Oh yeh, reminds me of last time I pulled the engine too. One of my 
co-workers wanted to go for a ride in it. So on the way to lunch I told 
him, "yeh, I pulled the engine yesterday to fix...." . He looked at me kind 
of scared.."In THIS". I said, "yeh". He kind of stiffened up and held on a 
little tighter to the side of the seat. I just had to laugh.
