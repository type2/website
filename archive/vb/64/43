Subject: type 3 squareback

well i just acquired a '67 squareback for FREE! just what i need another
projet to work on. this should free me up some more to be able to work on my
bus, i can get the rims powdercoated finally(i need to put the bus up on
blocks for probably 3 weeks for this) get some parts rechromed...basically i
will be able to take things apart on the bus without having to worry about
needing to get it back together before  i need to drive somewhere....

any leads on type 3 web sites, parts compatability among type 3's and anyone
on the list sell parts for these? i need some new window seals...

thanks
