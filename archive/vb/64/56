Subject: Re: [VB] Safari Windows

I had the 'sit-on' style of disconnects on my '56,  I'd park the wiper on
the left side, reach out the window and lift it off, then open the safari,
then reach out and park the wiper properly.

Without leaving the seat,  and without getting my oversized hands caught 
under the dash.
