Am I missing something on Link Pins?  I took the right side spindle off =
today to replace it.  The Link Pins seemed tight with the wheel on, so =
did the King Pins for that matter.  The Links don;t seem pitted and the =
roller bearings have no noticable scoring.  Is this all I should look =
for?  What I'm asking is it avisable to use the old Link Pins?
