Hello list,
Can anyone tell me how the wiper engagers/disengagers fit/work for a set
of Safari Windows.  It's pretty obvious that the wiper shafts fit into
the holes in the piece, and then secured by the set screw, but then
what?  These adapters have a rotating shaft on one end, and a metal post
with a half-moon cut-out on the other end.

Thanks in advance,
Ed
