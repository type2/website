Grease is what I was guessing; as I recall that was the first side I did.  I
cleaned things off and the braking became much happier.
Still need to pick up some tie rods.  Speaking of tie rods, I know I adjust
them to get the same size to get the toe-in right.  I was also thinking of
taking it somewhere for a front-end allignment afterwards.  Can the local
tire store do that,  or is this a specialty thing (given the fact I am
talking a 35 year old vehicle (its a '67)

Hi Rich,
Could be you over packed the grease.  You want just enough for the bearing
rollers/balls to be in a layer of grease, but not so much grease as to fill
the chamber up to the spindle!  Rechech the grease level now and recheck for
the black flaky stuff about 3,000 miles later.  As for the tie rod that
could
definitely be causing your steering problem.   Eric&Barb
