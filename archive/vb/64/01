Subject: BBB swappers?

Good-day buslist,

Does anyone have any of the following items that they might bring to
BBB for me?
1/ Pair of striker plates for the front doors, sawtooth in profile,
worn is fine, but mine are just about done worn out
2/ Prop/support for the engine lid, hinged arm style not spring
coat-hanger style, bungee cord is getting old, getting lost
3/ Is there such a thing as an inexpensive Sundial tent? Worn,
damaged, missing pieces is all good,   I just yearn for that seedy
little cloth casbah hanging off the side of the bus

If anyone wants a ride, a caravan, or something delivered to BBB and
it is on my way, I'd be happy to help. I will be splitting the morning
of the 18th, jumping on the 99 near Sacramento CA, heading south to
Bakersfield and hanging a left. All with a largely empty bus. On the
return trip I expect to be loaded down with the doubleclutch-free
tranny I am going to win in the raffle...

Thanks,
Joel and the '64 Sundial
