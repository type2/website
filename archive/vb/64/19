Subject: Re: [VB] '59 Kombi...one night engine pull

  I get the same awe struck reaction also.  I live in an 
apartment and when I'm done working for the night or it 
starts to rain I have to put the engine back in. friends 
can't believe I pull out all my tools and motor to start 
work and then clean up and reinstall when I'm done 
working so that nothing walks off!
  We have finally got a house tho, so it will be luxury 
having a garage...unfortunatly it looks like we will 
have to miss BBB this year due to escrow closing and 
moving :(  so take lots of pics!
