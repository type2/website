Subject: [VB] RE; broken head stud on new rebuild 

Hi Matt,
Replace the broken head stud and retorque all the lower head studs.  If the 
other lower unbroken head studs only need a few lbs. torque to get them to 
thier proper torque, all is well.  If they are super loose probably best to 
tear engine down to longblock and retorque all head studs.
