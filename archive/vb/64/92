Hi Dave,
Sounds good then!

Yes, and no.  Make sure the link pin bushings are not scored and that all the 
old grease drain holes are clear to allow new grease to push out the old 
gunky stuff.

Yes, as long as they are tight and not rusty use them!  Just make sure to 
grear the front zerk fittings every 3,000 miles.
