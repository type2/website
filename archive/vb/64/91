Hi Rich,
Could be you over packed the grease.  You want just enough for the bearing 
rollers/balls to be in a layer of grease, but not so much grease as to fill 
the chamber up to the spindle!  Rechech the grease level now and recheck for 
the black flaky stuff about 3,000 miles later.  As for the tie rod that could 
definitely be causing your steering problem.   Eric&Barb
