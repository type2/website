Subject: RE: [VB] clutch pedal

So, the pedal doesn't slip through the seal, it sticks to the rod and only
really seals to the floor when the clutch pedal is in the up position?
Also, then square end of the pedal is still quite a bit larger than the
little hole in the seal.  Is this a time to get out the soap and heat the
rubber up a bit?
