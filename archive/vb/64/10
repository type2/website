Subject: clutch pedal

Hi All,

The past few weeks saw some traffic regarding non-engaging clutches and
their remedies.
My new 67 tipper had one and I ended up tying a rope to the pedal to engage
the clutch during it's first week of driving.  Two nights ago, I started
with the pedal.  Removed it and stuck it in the gunk tank over night.  Last
night, I cleaned it up, greased it up and put it back in.... smooth as silk
and everything works.  If that didn't work, I was ready to remove the cable
and clean the tube out and then lastly replace the tranny return spring.
But not needed.  wohoo.  Although I guess that would have taken me no more
than about 2 hours after reading the last few posts about engine pulls.  In
the end, I got off cheap :-)

One item I looked at while I had the clutch pedal off was to replace the
pedal seal... that round thing that goes on the pedal and seals the floor
up.  I have a new one with the right part number on it but from the parts
manual, I couldn't figure out which way it goes... i.e. if you consider it
looking like a flat funnel, does the spout end go down or up?  Also, how the
&^%$& do you get the thing on?... gee maybe I have the wrong date code...
(ok, just joking)... thoughts?

As I turn my attention now to a few other items, I have started to compile a
few items I need... check my web site if any of you have some '67 parts as
I'm finding this 'late model' stuff is quite a bit different than my 59 dc.
