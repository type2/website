Subject: VW Spare Tire Gas can--

I know this is not completely bus related--But it is VW.  A friend of mine
has a VW Spare Tire Gas Can-- nice shape, no dents,  needs paint  he wants
$150 for it-- I could bring it to Pomona IF there is an interest.  If not no
big deal--I do NOT want to bring other people's expensive stuff to sell at
Pomona - because of the chance it could be stolen  Then I'm out$$$
If there is an interest PLMK by E-Mail right to me--thanks, uj
PS: I could ship it from Phoenix--
