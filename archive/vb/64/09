Well congratulations!!
My wife and I have been kinda sorta maybe sometimes
thinking about having another child...I hope all is
well with you and your family.
We used the front childs cot for our boy Ellis until
about six months ago, he is now about 75 pounds and is
six and a half  and has outgrown the space up front. 
I'll tell you what, and I said this before, I sure do
enjoy camping in our 79 Westy pop top with the two
beds and sink and built in stove and the swivel around
front chair. Don't get me wrong, I still have my 67
Sundial and still drive it and love it. But....

Again, I'm still not sure if I can make BBBVI due to
my upcoming surgery...but will try.
We almost came down your way a week ago to pop on in 
on our way back from Phoenix and north eastern AZ (to
see the Petrified Forest and all kind of fun Dino
stuff for my boy) and thought to take a trip home up
the coast, but, I had to get back early to go back to
the doctor and deliver my set of (free, under the
table thanks to my brother in law the doctor) MRI film
and get my back fixed. Looks like some serious surgery
coming down the pipe. 
If I don't make it to BBBVI, throw another log on the
fire for me.
The rebuild I did on the engine is still holding up
fine, 6 thousand miles already and no concerns!!
Thanks for a fine job on the heads Ronnie..

I hope you get to stay at the BBBVI this year and not
have to drive 80 miles (each way)or so to tow a broken
down bus on in.
