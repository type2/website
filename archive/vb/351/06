Check  the fuel cut-off solenoid on the side of the carb. Sometimes they

ya, that was loose on my 61 recently.   It made it idle low and  run crappy, 
but not stall out.    Was just barely not tightened  down.    Check the carb 
for leaky plug offs.  with a 34 pict  3, do you have the round plug?   If that 
gets loose it can fall out  and the engine will run really bad.  JB weld will 
seal that round plug  up.
