She probably didn't get the engine up in temps just putting around  town.  I 
heard of a bug bought off Orcas Island, that a guy we  know bought.   He 
pulled the 40hp motor, and stripped it  to a long block to clean it/torque 
heads/replace oil seals.  The fins  of the cylinders and heads were completely clogged 
due to oil oozage and the  dust from the dirt roads gluing to the oil....  it 
had been driven for  years this way!!!!   But Orcas Island has no highways, 
and it's not  far from one side to the other, and it isn't very hot there, so 
the engine never  overheated!!!

In the  many years we have been into VWs, we have seen way too many  engine  
cases with rod damage through the top of the engine case.  So for  us  "floor 
it and ignore it" is not an option.  Yes, there are  going to be  fluke 
engines, 
but most of those are going to be due to  special driving  conditions.  Heck, 
we know of one instance  where a little old lady  only drove in town and 
after 
30,000 original  miles on her bug decided to drive  on the highway to visit a 
 
friend.  Engine nuked, and turned out the  doghouse cooler stand  was not 
drilled through at the factory.  So in other  words we  know one can drive 
without a 
working oil cooler for 30,000  miles!
