OK,

Here we go. How to calculate engine rpm, given speed, tire diameter and gear
ratios.

Michael, no telling which gears are actually in your transmission.

First measure your rear tire radius. Center of wheel to ground and multiply
that by 2. Now you have your rolling tire diameter. Multiply that by pi
(3.1416)  and divide that by 12. call that rolling circumference or Rc.

Calculate tire RPM by:

5280*(MPH/60) = feet per minute

Divide your feet per minute by Rc:  (FPM/Rc) = tire RPM. (Trpm)

Now multiply Trpm by RDC ratio, R&P ratio and the gear ratio.
Eample:  Trpm x 1.26 x 4.125 x .82 = engine rpm in 4th gear.

Here is a full blown calculation at 40 mph and a rolling tire diameter of 26
inches:

26 x 3.1416/12 = 6.81, tire circumference in feet.
(5280 x 40/60)/6.81 =  3520/6.81 = 516.88,  tire rpm at 40mph
516.88 x 1.26 x 4.125 x .82 = 2202.9 rpm.,  engine rpm in 4th at 40mph

There you go!
Have fun,
Chris

  Hi Mr Dreike,
  Been following the thread on the freeway flyer tranny with
  great interest. Could you send me a copy of the formulas
