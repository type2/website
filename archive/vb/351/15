Subject: EveryBus T-shirt details

Howdy y'all...as you've seen, it's coming up on EveryBus time again this
year...I'm doing the t-shirts again, and it's time to get your shirts
pre-ordered...Details are on my site
http://www.teamspatula.com
there's a link to the t-shirt page right off the main page...There's only
a limited window for pre-orders, so please try to get them in as soon as
you can. And please don't wait to get one there - I'll only have a few
extras onsite, and those are usually snapped up in the first half hour
after I arrive...
thanks,
