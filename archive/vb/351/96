Subject: Re: [VB] Help: excessively high oil pressure

Christian,
Your thoughts are looking in the correct ways. Do you have a oil 
pressure gauge to verify the high pressure? If not that would add some 
more data and we like data. Were the oil coolers pre tested?  Maybe bad 
oil coolers but two of them?? are the seals holding?
If as with most new motor recommendations break-ins you are holding the 
RPMs high for break-in  30 minutes. We see 70 -80 lb. on cold start up 
on used motors and keep the RPMs down at first until the oil warms
What weight oil are you using? We use a synthetic 5-50.
Hope this helps.
P & C
