Summer before last I bypassed my external oil cooler (stock oil cooler
removed with a blockoff plate) and drove my 64 bus (1600 DP) around to watch
what the temps would do.

As long as I kept it below 55mph, my oil temps wouldn't reach 220. Head
temps did not change one bit from where they normally ran. I drove for miles
and miles at 55mph, and my head temps stayed at 320 to 340 and oil temps
hovered around 210 to 220.

It is a MAJOR misconception that oil coolers cool the motor (Got a big
motor? Stick a larger cooler on it! Those lines always crack me up). The
only thing they are there for is to keep the engine oil within the safe
operating range so that it can lubricate properly.
