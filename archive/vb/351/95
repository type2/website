Subject: Help: excessively high oil pressure

Volks,

I have a newly rebuilt 1600DP engine (CW crank, dynamically
balanced) for my 63 Dormobile. Problem is it has blown two oil coolers
within seconds of start-up. After installation the engine ran for about
20 seconds each time before the new oil cooler ruptured and pissed oil
all over the engine.

Any ideas on what might cause this?

My understanding is that the oil pressure relief valve causes oil flow
to bypass the oil cooler when the oil is cold (is this correct, or is
there some flow through the cooler when cold?). Apparently the relief valve
also bleeds off any excess oil pressure back to the sump.

The relief valve is free in its bore and the spring is the correct length,
so that seems not to be the problem, although shouldn't it be causing excess
oil pressure to bypass back to the sump?

I think there are three possibilities:
a) oil pressure relief valve spring too strong;
b) the "heavy duty" oil pump fitted by the engine builder is too beefy for
the job; or
c) there is a blocked oilway or incorrectly fitted bearing that is blocking
oil flow and causing back pressure into the cooler.

Other ideas? Experience with this kind of problem?

Please support me to get the Dormer back on the road!

PS: For varous reasons, not the least being that the guy is dead now,
I choose not to take this engine back to the builder.
