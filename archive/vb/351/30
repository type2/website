Subject: Re: [VB] need for freeway flyer?

Jason,

I ran a 1600 in my 64(big nut tranee) for about 30 years(hey, I learned to
drive in San Francisco in that bus!). No problem on the freeway. Cruise
65-70 all you want. Calculating engine rpm's with a .82 4th, I came up with
about 3900 rpm at 70mph. When I installed a dual port 1600, it would
(believe it or not) do 80 on the flat(not recommended)! I have a weber
progressive carb, the standard 28pict would not do this. I found that an
engine will last about 75-80k miles before it is time to rebuild or replace.
I have over 300k miles on my bus.

BTW it would coast 80 coming down the hill into SLO on 101.

Cheers,
Chris
