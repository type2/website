I have a low CR 1600 sp (6.6-1cr) that I've run in a '66 westy with the 
OG 4.375-1 R&P and also in my '67 bus with a genuine 4.12-1 R&P.   This 
low power engine ran cooler, got better fuel economy and had more useful 
power in the '66.  The 4.12 '67 bus runs better with a stronger engine.  
There are many variables at work here.  I think that it makes sense to 
consider what issues are most important to you?  Highway speed, engine 
longevity, low end grunt?????
