Jason,

If you don't want to do the tach, you can calculate the engine rpms at
various speeds and gears. If you look at your speedo, there are marks
telling you when to shift.

Gear ratios:
1st    3.80:1
2nd    2.06:1
3rd    1.22:1
4th    .82:1
Final drive is 4.125:1
Reduction gears, I forgot, Can someone else fill that in please. Big Nut.

Chris
