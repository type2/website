Subject: Re: [VB] Rust Prevention Question

Hi Jdd,
If you look at the rust convertors directions they tell you to make sure to 
remove all but the thinnest coating of rust for the products to work properly!  
Otherwise if the rust is too thick the rust convertor only cures the top of 
the rust leaving rust underneath to come back with a vengeance.
  We prefer to use wire wheel, phospheric acid, and sandpaper, though not 
necessarily in the exact order.  Then a high content zinc primer (must be more 
that 85% or wasting $ and time) and a good coating of paint.
  For problem areas that are so tight that only acid can get out all the rust 
and getting the zinc primer, and paint in (like pop out windows, safaris, 
doors, or tubing) it might be a good idea to check out your local zinc plater.  
When an object is to be plated it must be dipped in an acid tank to completely 
remove all corrosion.  Plating with zinc is not labor intensive so is very low 
in cost, unlike chroming with multiple layers of plating and polishing each 
of those layers to get a perfect mirror shiney finish.
  Then you can lightly sand the zinc plating, zinc primer and paint, or even 
take your bumper parts to a powdercoater for a marine purpose zinc primer and 
color coating.

The below is one of many zinc primer availible on the market:

Here is "History Of Coatings at KSC", some of the zinc coatings were setup 
back in 1969 and are still undergoing exposure testing.  Many show no signs of 
corrosion to this day:
