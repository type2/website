Chris,

Thanks for your input. When you say "widest fan" what are you referring
to? I'm a vw mechanical novice (though between us, my wife and I have
owned an even dozen).

We moved to Grover Beach from SLO about 3 years ago and my favorite part
of the trip is the north end of Shell Beach road where you get that
great view of the ocean from 101 before you head inland to SLO

Regards,

Jason
