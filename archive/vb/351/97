Hi Fig,
We have had "A" happen to us, and know "B" can happen, but doubt "C" could  
happen just by one bearing being blocked.
  Also could be due to, or at least partly due to:
D.  Using too thick of oil for the outside temp.
E.  Using the grooved oil pressure relief valve in outside temps  below 70 F.
