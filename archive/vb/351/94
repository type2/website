I know I'm a little late to the party, but in a word: no.

It takes a little flipping around to do it, but you can come up with the
following numbers out of the '63-'67 Bentley for a 1965 model one-ton
Transporter.  (I suspect, but cannot prove, that since the one-ton model
became an option in August 1963, that only one-ton models were imported
to the US.)

Engine: 1493 cc, 51 brake horsepower SAE (-at-) 4000 rpm,
   70.16 ft-lbs torque SAE (-at-) 2400 rpm,
   compression ratio 7.8:1

Transmission:
1  3.80:1
2  2.06:1
3  1.22:1
4  0.82:1
R  3.88:1

Rear axle:
    4.375:1

Reduction gears:
    1.26:1

Maximum speed:
105 km/h (65 mph) at 4050 rpm.

The chart on page 109 of the 1969 "Without Guesswork" at
http://failsure.net/oacdp/ backs up the transmission, rear axle, and
reduction gear numbers.

Anyway, the most important thing is that maximum speed of 65 mph at
4050 rpm.  Realize that the rpm has zilch to do with what size engine
you have, and everything to do with all the gear ratios between the
clutch and the tires.  You could put a Ch(-at-)vy 454 in there and it
would still be turning 4050 rpm at 65 mph.  Now, 4050 rpm is a happy
place for a Ch(-at-)vy 454 to be, but the list consensus is that it's not
a happy place for a Type I/II/III VW engine to be for very long.

VW didn't seem to recommend running the engine that hard, either.
Look at page 139 of that '69 "Without Guesswork".  The top speed
quoted for a Type II/1600 was 105 km/h (65 mph) at 3900 rpm.

If you look in the '73 "Without Guesswork", in '71, the last year of
the 1600 in Buses, the engine developed 60 brake hp SAE at 4400 rpm
(page 4).  Page 146 says they rated the Type II/1600 at 68 mph at
4100 rpm max - again, not running the engine as hard as it could be.

As has been mentioned, all of these numbers are for a stock Bus.
Since it's been a day or two since our Buses rolled off the line,
nearly anything could have happened since then.  If you're interested,
you can figure out what gear ratios you probably have:

Again, I'm a little late to the party, but I want to reiterate what John
D. said.  "Installing a tach" doesn't have to mean attacking your
pristine Barndoor dash with a 3" hole saw!  I ran a wire from the coil,
out the left side engine vent, back in the left rear pop-out, over the
middle of the front seat, to the dash.  I bent up some 14 gauge solid
wire to make a hanger and hung my tune-up tach from the dash grab
handle, angled toward me... not easy to monitor constantly, but easy
enough to glance at.

Some tune-up tachs only need the wire to the coil and ground.  Mine is
like that; I clipped the ground wire to the grab handle bolt under the
dash.  Some also need battery voltage; you can get that at the fuse box.
If you have one that needs battery voltage and the alligator clip on
the battery wire has lost its insulator, fabricate another insulator
(electrical tape, piece of old fuel line, whatever) for the alligator
clip before you hook it to the fuse box to prevent fireworks.

At the coil end, if you're just doing this for a Sunday drive, you can
get away with stripping the long wire to the front about 2", wrapping
it around the points wire terminal at the coil a couple of times, and
twisting it back around itself.  Use a little electrical tape on the
bare spot (if this grounds out, you get no spark) and you're ready to
go.  If it's raining and you can't leave the pop-outs open, or if you're
worried about the wire on the engine vents, slide a few inches of old
fuel line over the wire where it goes through the vents and the window.

An alligator clip crimped or soldered onto the end of the long wire
makes for a slightly more permanent connection.  Make sure the clip is
reasonably well insulated, as above.  What I did was crimp the long wire
from the front, plus another short chunk of wire, into a female push-on.
I then crimped a male push-on onto the other end of the short chunk of
wire.  Unplug points wire, plug it onto new male push-on, plug new
female push-on onto coil, and I have "tapped" the connection.

Most tune-up tachs have a low range, about 0-1500 RPM, and a high range,
maybe 0-6000 or 0-8000 RPM.  Put yours on the high range and have at it.
I think most people find that they are winding up their engine harder
than they think they are.

I hope this helps!
