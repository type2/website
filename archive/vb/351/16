I checked out a bug recently. It was only $1200, "Daily driver. Great 
engine. etc. etc." When I got there, I spotted a green shag carpet 
underneath the engine. I put my head under just so I could feel the 
squish of oil and wet carpet. The entire bottom of the engine looked 
like the Exxon Valdeez.

Daily driver. Like for the next few days. ;-)
