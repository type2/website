Subject: Barndoor Bus Hitch

I found a bus hitch that I'm told by the seller is made to fit my 54 single 
cab, but am wondering if it is the real thing.  Can anyone help to identify 
what is different (if anything) about a german hitch to fit the barndoor 
buses, over the 55 up buses?

Thanks, Charles
