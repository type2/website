Subject: RE: [VB] need for freeway flyer?

Chris,

Are you a local boy, or do you just know the area?

From your email, it sounds like I don't need to bother with modifying
the tranny or getting a freeway flyer. Is that correct? I plan to put a
bigger engine in it this year; will that necessitate doing anything
transmission-wise?

Thanks for your quick response.

Jason
