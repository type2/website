Subject: RE: [VB] Barndoor Bus Hitch

Not to hijack the thread, but if anyone has a *german* tow hitch to fit
my 67 tipper truck they would like to sell, please contact me.

Charles asked: I found a bus hitch that I'm told by the seller is made
to fit my 54 single 
cab, but am wondering if it is the real thing.  Can anyone help to
identify 
what is different (if anything) about a german hitch to fit the barndoor

buses, over the 55 up buses?
