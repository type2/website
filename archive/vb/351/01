Subject: Engine cutting out

OK guys, I know I can puzzle this out eventually but wanted to quiz the
collective to see if anyone had run across these symptoms before.
1600DP, 34pict3, SVDA dizzy, stock coil etc.
My bus fires then quits as soon as I release the starter.
Yesterday she quit spontaneously two or three times usually decelerating to
a stop sign.
But after 6 or 8 resart attempts she fired up.
I'm thinking one of three possibilities: 
Bad regulator
Bad coil
Short to either one of above.
Hints?
