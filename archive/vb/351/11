Subject: friday fun- "Top 10 Things I have learned shopping for VW's &

'Cuz it's friday and I am puh-ruzing the online
classifieds and auction listings for VW's & parts as I
always do... Here are some things I have learned over
the past few years from doing this ALOT!:
So drum roll, please

TOP 10 THINGS I HAVE LEARNED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS
OF ON-LINE VW SHOPPING:

10) The phrases "One-of-a-Kind" and "Unique" are
usually BAD things.
9) Avoid sellers who use the following phrases in
their ads: "Bad-ass" "Phat" or "Pimpin"
8) There are MANY interpretations of the word
"running".
7) If a seller says "They ALL leak that much oil" then
leave, NOW!
6) If a seller says "ALL the baywindows have rust
under the windshield like that" then leave, NOW!
5) Avoid even looking at a bus if the ad has any of
the following words in the title: "Shaggin", "Hippie",
or "Surfer" (and I AM a hippie!)
4) To many people, body filler can be described as
"Solid".
3) The definition of the word "Rare" is apparently 'An
object so crusted or rusty that it is difficult to
distinguish its true function'
2) Alternate definition of the word "Rare" is
'Something that I have many of stacked in my garage
because i cannot use them"
1) If a vehicle is described as needing "TLC", then
what it really needs is definitely NOT Tender, Loving,
or Caring..it IS BFH and LDW (Big F-ing Hammering and
Lotta Damn Welding)
