Subject: Re: pulley stuff w/ freeway flyer 

 I run a Porsche top pulley, it's 3 3/4" dia. and the crank pulley is a stock
VW pulley BUT it's not the 6 3/4" one it's  the 'D' pulley which is a full 7"
across.  My ratio is 2.3 or 2.4 to one.
My motor is a 1904 and a 'standard' 3.88 freeway flier, 205/75/15 tires and at
65mph I'm approximately at 3200 RPM.  I live in the heat of the desert and
only use my '61 Westy for long trips to campouts so most all my driving is in
the extreme heat.
 With the stock tranny I would be spinning the fan a lot faster with the stock
pulleys but with the FF tranny using the small top/larger bottom pulley brings
the fan speed back up to where it should be at the same given MPH speed.  This
works very well for me, in colder temps I could easily change the top pulley
for a stock one if needed.
The fan belt is a 'Contitech' 10X888, AVX10X888.
My oil temps are always in the normal range 220 being tops, I don't have a
head temp gauge in yet, the bus is wired for it, I just haven't installed the
one I have for it yet.  Doing the tried and true 'spit test' the motor is
running at a safe temp.
