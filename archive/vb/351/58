We have oil temp and pressure type3 with 35 mm and 2.2 fan cooling ratio 
and have never tried the blocking trick, But the temp stays low in town 
at is after an hour of road speed under 55 for us that the temp does 
rise and this is a function of outside air temp, time of day, humidity, 
hills, .....
Thanks for one more input data.

Summer before last I bypassed my external oil cooler (stock oil

around to watchwhat the temps would do.As long as I kept it below 55mph, 
my oil temps wouldn't reach 220. Headtemps did not change one bit from 
where they normally ran. I drove for milesand miles at 55mph, and my 
head temps stayed at 320 to 340 and oil tempshovered around 210 to 220.
