Subject: Re: [VB] Rust Prevention Question

John,

Rust inside of tubes is a tough subject. Plating will most likely happen
only on the outside of the tubes. You still need to treat the inside. I
would use an acid rust remover, then use picklex for an excellent phosphate
coating inside. The metal prep from POR-15 works pretty good too. POR-15
inside will be pretty permanent provided you get out most of the rust in the
first place. I do like the use of 95% zinc primer (by the way, rustoleum
rattle can 'zinc rich' primer will last remarkabley well on a muffler and
the exhaust system exterior, it just won't burn off.) . I did my roof
gutters about 20 years ago with that and they lasted until the restoration
in 03.

Good luck,
Chris
