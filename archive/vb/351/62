I would think they would cancel each other out somewhat. The power pulley
slows the fan down, then the 356 pulley speeds it back up.

Also, don't waste money buying the oversized crank pulley if you're full
flowed. It will not clear the pump cover. I ran into that problem when I was
trying to test it a couple years back.
