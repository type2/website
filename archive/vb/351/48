We have used the smaller generator pulley a get 2:2 ratio vice stock 
1:1.6 and that does turn the fan faster.
We have not found a part number for the smaller pulley :( .
What is the stock LOWER pulley size and how does the larger one fit in 
the stock tin and can you change the belt?
What is the source and number of the 200 mm pulley?
We have seen smaller "power" pulleys.
