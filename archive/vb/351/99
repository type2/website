Subject: Re: [VB] Help: excessively high oil pressure

I just checked the oil pump on this engine against those in several other 
engines I have lying about, and it looks at least twice the depth of all the 
others. I guess that makes for a more powerful pump.

If the oil pump turns out to be the suspect, then is thinner oil a workable 
solution?

I compared the relief valve spring to another one using the unscientific 
forefinger and thumb press method. They felt the same to me.

This is a Mexican universal case with dual relief valves. I've only looked 
at the rearmost one (pulley side). What does the front one do? All my 
factory manuals date from the 50s and 60s, so they're not too enlightening 
there.

I spoke to the engineers who balanced the engine, and I'm taking the 
complete engine there on Monday so they can run it on the bench and see 
what's really up.
