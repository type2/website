  In the type2.com archieves there is a formula for finding your gear ratios in a trans by counting tire revolutions.
How do you know your speed, a speedo can be off and tire size can affect this also. You didn't mention tire size.
I drive ALL my buses at 3500 to 3900 rpm with the average at 3800, hot, cold outside temps, I don't change,makes no 
difference to me. I find that in 100+ heat MY engines are happier at 3600 to 3700 with them having the tendency to 
start heating up when running at 3000 rpm (to slow of fan speed). TOO much load on the engine with a 3.88 with the 
82 4th gear at 3000 rpm, specially if using a 215X15 tire. In impromto testings (feeling the air out of the defroster 
vents) I have found that between 3300 to 4000 is when you feel the most air, above 4000 you can feel the air out of 
the vents slowing down.
   Everyone has there own feelings and experiences on this and this is debatted as much as tires and which oil and/or 
cooler to use.
   Of all the bus people I know most seem to run in the 3500 to 4000 rpm range (not with stock old 1600's though), 
have been doing it for years and their engines are still fine. I think that at the next BBB I will put on the entry 
form "What rpm's do you run and what size engine" This should work out well with over 200 buses showing up with 
over 3/4 of them driving 300 plus miles to get here.
