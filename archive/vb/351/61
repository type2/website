200MM is  Bigger then stock,  ergo your cooling fan runs faster.   You  can
also go the other way and use a 36HP upper pulley  that will also  increase
fan speed.  The 200MM pulley will require a longer belt   In both of my
busses the 200MM was a close fit  but no alterations  were needed for the
cooling tin.  I am Very pleased with this simple  installation regarding
cooling,   especially in a  bus



Where do you get a 200mm pulley? Thats as large as the flywheel?  Mike
