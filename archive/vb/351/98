hey Guys and gals    First we need to know a little more  single or dual 
relief case?? I have seen where the springs were reversed and caused over 100psi 
pressure,  also make sure that there arent two relief valves in the same hole 
seen this happen also .  hook apresure gage to the engine and get a real 
reading . Also could be the wrong oil cooler seals blocking the passage.  Dont think 
it would be the pump or the case passages blocked. later and have fun  Mark
