Subject: RE: [VB] : Heavy pulley reviews needed.

Sorry ment smaller...Brain is being bad today.

Lack of sleep and a freshly unrunning engine in the singlecab have caused my math skills to suck with the exception of knowing the balance sheet on the vehicle goes red soon.

Ted, You may be right.
do you mean larger or smaller 356 gen pulley?
I think, all other things being equal, smaller fan pulley means more revolutions of the fan.
