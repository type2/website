Subject: Paint question - waterproofing brown oxide primer? 

Greetings again all,

Two questions in two days!

My 62 DC will be a working truck and 'test sled'.

I'm thinking of the brown oxide primer look
before eventual paint'n'body.  Anyone know of a way
to waterproof a primer, or, alternatively a primer that
is waterproof.  Would a good dose of something
like penetrol help water resistance?
