Subject: [VB] Re: Weird ebay Auction: Radiation sign from Russia

Apparently my sense of humor was too aloof to be understood.

I thought it funny that a sign warning of radiation might be radioactive
itself. I could imagine the UPS guy delivering the package glowing like an old
flourescent light bulb...

Expended rod cores? Why send them to Nevada when there is eBay! Boxes of
powdered asbestos dust? Medical waste? Biotoxins in "slightly damaged" vials?
Yeah, let me step right up and bid on that! <not>
