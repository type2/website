Subject: Re: [VB] Double Cab question?

A few people have mentioned to me that trucks did not have the innner strengthner which was spot
welded to the backside of the outer rocker skin, which is why alot of truck owners like the
schofield piece as opposed to others like the WW piece, since the schofield rocker skin comes
without the inner strengthener attached.

Although i replaced the rocker on my binz and it had the inner strengthner, but it also had belly
pans and was 'custom made' by Binz so thats a different story i suppose. Binz probably added it for
strength. Also thom did a rocker replacement article on a dual treasure door SC and it had the inner
strengthner. So perhaps it was only used on trucks needing the extra strength? Can anyone shed light
on this?
