Subject: Drink holder

A little while back people were discussing what to do for a drink holder in a
bus.

While at the Eureka Springs show last weekend, I saw something so simple and
effective, I was disgusted in myself for not thinking of it myself:

Since I'm waay too lazy to ride my mountain bike anywhere that would require
two water bottles, i'm going to transfer one of the cages onto my bus in the
same fashion. I was way impressed with it's simplicity.
