Subject: new floor panel

i just bought a 1967 panel convert from a guy down the road from me. i live 
in woodstock georgia so a split is a rare sighting. the floor in front of 
the passenger seat has a hole where the guy cut out the rust, but he forgot 
to weld a new piece back in. i checked busdepot.com for a new piece but they 
dont have one that will fit the hole. does anyone know where i can get a 
CHEAP piece for my floor? this is my first bus/vehicle and i am only 15 so 
my father is buying the bus and parts for my 16th b-day.
                                         thanks,
                                       josh 1967 panel convert
