Subject: Bus in Magazine Ad Alert

In the August 2003 issue of Outside magazine
is an ad from GE for a Lexan coating to replace
painting, showing a pseudo-60's hippie bus
from the lower left front looking up. It's
far to well done to be a true hippie bus,
but it's cute anyway. Page 50.

Their tag line is that is won't be available
with a 'flower power' color option.
