I don't know anything about rocker panels other than what pics I have seen of
Kelly's. When I bought my SC two years ago the rockers had been removed and
brand new rockers and separate strengtheners were included in the pile of
parts that came with it. The reason the rockers were not replaced was because
the doglegs (?) were rotted and had to be replaced. I have since found a
couple of cross beams and other assorted pieces that need to be fixed or
replaced also.

A few people have mentioned to me that trucks did not have the innner
strengthner which was spot
welded to the backside of the outer rocker skin, which is why alot of truck
owners like the
schofield piece as opposed to others like the WW piece, since the schofield
rocker skin comes
without the inner strengthener attached.
