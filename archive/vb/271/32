Hi Diane,
The rear are easy once you remove the engine.  The front mount is alot harder 
due to needing to almost completely removing the tranny and it sounds like 
the front mount is shot due to your clutch clunk noise.  BTW does the shifter 
move about like it is being shifted by a ghostly hand at the same time of the 
clunk??

Oil leak can be from many causes.  You need to locate EXACTLY where the drip 
is dropping off the VW and if it is engine or tranny oil.  This three day 
weekend would be perfect for a beginner to remove the engine Friday night and 
remove the tranny Saturday and R/R stuff in there.  While you have it out replace 
and grease the rear shift linkage bushings and install new rubber boots on the 
body tube it passes through.  The biggest problem to doing the rear shift 
linkage is unbolting the front coupler and should be worked on this week (Like 
tonight and ever night) till you get it loose.  Read through the archives for 
more info on this forward linkage bolt!!!
