Subject: Thanks for EVERYTHING

Just wanted to drop a note to say "thanks for EVERYTHING."  I have a special
saved mail folder [sub-folder] with more subfolders in my inbox .. and have
printed out a ream of paper with all your information.  EVERYONES information.
Much of it is greek to me now, and it will probably take me a year to do
everything that I want to do.  Just wanted to write this thank you so that you
all know that your answers are NOT ignored .. in fact, I treasure every last
one of them.  Great advice.
