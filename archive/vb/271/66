Hi Steve,
Someone on this list just a while ago found the same jet gauge as we have 
from a supplier of aftermarket carbs for VW (Weber?).  We just found this 
supplier lists a jet gauge at:
<A HREF="http://www.racecarsupply.com/html/carburetor.html">http://www.racecarsupply.com/html/carburetor.html</A>
  We got our's through a friend at "Bow Wow" auto parts, and it was a pain 
for him to locate us one.
