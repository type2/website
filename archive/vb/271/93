Remove the crush washer that is on the #3 spark plug, and replace it with
the sending unit. With the spark plug in the socket that you are going to
use, bend the sending wires so they run along the socket. That way you can
install the sender with ease. Expect the sending unit to get chewed up after
about 4-5 plug changes. They're cheap to replace when the time comes.

Some people mount them under a head stud, but results in a lower and slower
reading. Not prefferable in my opinion. I would prefer the hottest reading I
can get so I don't get a false sense of security.

Anywhere between 300 and 375 head temp is normal. 400 is getting hot, and
425 is when bad things like dropped seats can happen.
