Subject: por-15 dead horse

Sorry to flog this one again, buuuuuut:
I'm in a situation where I can't hose off the underside of my bus when
degreasing it. Does anyone out there have any experience using laquer thinner
or some other solvent to de-grease before applying por-15? I'm not sure if the
thinner would leave any residue that would defeat the integrity of the
por-15.

Thanks,
