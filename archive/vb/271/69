Subject: RE: [VB] : Heavy pulley reviews needed.

Thanks for all the great feedback!

It seems to me that Latest Rage has a decent product and I think I will give 
it a shot.  If for some reason it is not up to par then I will report back.  
Jake Raby can confirm the balance issue as well as he will be performing the 
balance on the engine.  Jake has the right equipment and takes the time to 
get it right, an A+ service from my previous results.

The 356/912 gen pulley is a good idea, but just keep in mind that it could 
blow your fan up if you rev up the motor to high RPMs.  Or just get a welded 
fan that will not grenade, they are relatively cheap.  The 356 parts you can 
still get new, not cheap, but definately a good upgrade in my opinion on a 
low revving bus.  Granted I do not run this setup, I like the old German 
pulleys for my specific needs.


Thanks,
Adrian Pillow
