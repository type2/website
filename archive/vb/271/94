I know that this is how my bus came and I have seen a few others that are also like that. I'm not sure, but it may have to do with the color of the bus and or year of manufacture. I "think" most of the ones I have seen with the white color are Dove Blue.

I have a '65(pop-top)and a '67(hard top) both pearl white (L87) and they
both have the white wheel and column.  FWIW.
