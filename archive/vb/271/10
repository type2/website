Subject: Retorquing Heads

Hey Guys,
Regarding the retorquing of heads, I am concerned that the head studs are
pulling out of their threads in the case. I read recently on the list that
there are case saver studs. How do these work? Do you need to put them in
when the case is open? Is there a way to install them with engine together?
Dave
