Subject: RE: [VB] guages - many questions

Tom, for the few engines I was worried about CHT I used T-3 or later model bug
heads with the CHT threaded hole and a factory sensor. Being here in the PNW
with moderate temps all year I never worry about my daily driver. When I build
an engine it stays in after the 500 mile retorque for the next 60 to 80K and
just gets the regular tuneup and oil change.

Subject: [VB] guages - many questions


I got my guages today (now I can really see what damage I am doing to my
engine)  And I have a question or two.  I think I will mount them between the
package tray and the dash.  The guages in question are a CHT, oil temp and
oil
pressure.  I got the dual sender for the pressure, so that one is covered.
The CHT has the spark plug mount.  Does this give an accurate reading?  Is
the
#3 the norm cyl.  for mounting?  are there alternitives?  I think that is
about it.  What are the normal operating temps / pressure for these guages?
The engine is a 1600DP with out any modifications
