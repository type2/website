Hmmmm, I suppose you could break them up into 8 1/2" x 11" sections that are
jpegs or pdf's or something else common, & then print them out on your
printer & tape em together w/ match lines like I did w/ Thom's colored
wiring diagrams.  Or they could be emailed to a printer w/ a large plotter &
printed out full size??
 Kinko's could do this if you gave em a autocad or similar file.
