Subject: Re: [VB] brakes on my 1967 panel convert

sounds like something went bad and the fluid is leaking out.  So you have to 
find where.   is this a new thing, or did it just start happening?   This can 
happen when a flex line bursts, or a wheel cylinder is bad, but if it was a 
cylinder you would have brakes gradually get worse and worse.   Sounds like it 
is time to check the entire brake system.   If you put you finger in the brake 
adjust hole in the drums, is it wet in there?   It should be dry.  do this 
with wheel jacked up so you can turn the wheel and check all around.  Any leaks 
mean the cylinders on that axle (both sides) should be replaced, probably shoes 
too.   Replace flex lines if not done in last 5 years.  They should have no 
cracks or holes or tumors, but can be bad even if they look okay on the 
outside.  look under front of bus for master cylinder, its behind the thing that 
moves when the brake pedal is stepped on.  If you have the pedal pan on, you must 
take it off to see the MC.   Is it leaking?  once in a while a metal line goes 
bad and springs a leak, too.
