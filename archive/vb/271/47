Ted, You may be right.
do you mean larger or smaller 356 gen pulley?
I think, all other things being equal, smaller fan pulley means more revolutions of the fan.

If you try the Achiever w/ the 356 pulley, let the list know what happens.

I still think that having been advised of the problem and having verified it,
GBE should notify its customers.
sorta gives the lie to the POTL stuff....
