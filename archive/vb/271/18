Subject: Trade nice bug for splittie project 

Hey Y'all,
I have a nice 73 bug (NOT a superbeetle) that I'd like
to to trade for a split window bus (can be a project
bus!)
It runs great with 34K original miles.
I am just north of Cincinnati, Ohio and I can handle
delo=ivery for the right deal.
Here's the link to pix and info:
