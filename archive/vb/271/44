We are heading to Jerome Wednesday night which means we should be there by Thursday afternoon.It's a 16 hour drive!
Is there anywhere to stay around there, or will the mine be open then? Prefer cheap to pricey (I'm sure you've heard about employment opportunites in CA as of late!) and we don't mind sleeping on the Z-Bed!

A day early but not a dollar short!
