Sure you have the correct year shoes?  '64+ are bigger.  If you can find
a machinist who isn't really picky about the "legal" thickness limit of
drums have them turned.  Lastly, I recently had to take a grinder to the
leading edges of some shoes to get them to slip on.  You only need to
take them down a small amount to allow the drum to fit.  Crappie reman. tolerances.
