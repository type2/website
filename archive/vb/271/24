You guys would know, but what is that small square piece just forward of

Well in 59 The binz did get normal opening style rear doors.... BUT

That piece of metal is some kind of hackjob replacement piece. The rockers looks pretty sketchy as
well. I think its some kind of owner made wanna-be Binz, look at the door how round the top corners
are, also the door doesnt even go to the top of the roof line. And the post behind the rear door is
twice as fat as it should be, Rear windows arent long enough, The upper rear hinge is too low, also
hinge doesnt go through the body, no rear door handle indent, etc etc. The guy quit returning my
emails once i started questioning him down. Ah well.
