Subject: Re: [VB] Strangest injuries

I was prying the return spring onto the arm of the throwout bearing shaft
with a
screwdriver........ the screwdriver slipped and put a gash just above my
lip. One trip to the emergency room and two stitches later I was back in the
garage. Could have been worse, i.e.. eye injury etc.

Mechanics Tip.... Vitamin E oil reduces/eliminates scarring!!!
