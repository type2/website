I did a similar but not as drastic thing when I was working on my
F*rd T*mp*.  I was changing the coolant and hoses, so my arms were
wet with sweat and coolant.  I was standing by the left front fender,
leaning over the engine to loosen a bolt with a ratchet.  I laid my
right arm and elbow on a handy flat surface - in this case, the top
of the battery.  After a few moments I felt a funny tingling sensation
near my elbow and pulled my arm back to see what was going on.
Apparently I had completed the circuit from the battery positive post,
through my arm and hand, through the ratchet, to the engine.  I had
a little burned spot on the underside of my arm, like a sunburn.
Doing something like that and getting off relatively easy tends to
make you much more careful about dancing with Reddy Kilowatt in the
future...
