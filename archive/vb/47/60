Depending on precisely what happened, I can see several categories under
"Unintentional Injury" for repair accidents... fire/burn, transport-other,
struck by/against, machinery, cut/pierce, overexertion...

You're right.  That 866 number was for accidental firearm deaths.  So
for 1998 we have

Unintentional Injury - Motor Vehicle Traffic  42,191
Homicide - Firearm                            12,102

>I wonder if that 12,102 includes the 50 kids I have "unintentionally"

Naah, that'd probably go under the 866 number, if you accidentally did
it with a gun.
