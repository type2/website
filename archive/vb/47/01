I am thinking that you could whip up a batch with this material right here.
At 3 1/2 feet by 4 feet there should be enough there to last awhile. Sell
them to the listees to make your money back. If I didn't have such a backlog
of projects I would do it myself. Should be a cakewalk with a hole saw, they
are just like a washer split in half.
