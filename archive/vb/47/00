 you started with your torch. The hammer throw, as in exasperation you throw
 your balpeen hammer at the floor (insert toolbox etc) and dodge concrete
 chips.
 The winner could get a firstaid kit in a Haznet box.

ok heres one for you, althou i was not working on a bus at the time it still 
makes my knees touch when i think about it.
me and my father were drilling a 6" steel pipe with a 3/4 heavy duty drill ( 
about a 5/8 bit on it ) i was on the other side of the upright pipe, drill 
and bit slipped off the pipe (you know where this is going dont you) of 
course he had his wieght pushing hard on the drill,   well it caught me about 
1" to the left of my zipper in a pair of levi's that went from a size 34 to a 
size 28 in about 2 seconds (dont worry the little guy was fine) still shudder 
to think what almost was.
