Subject: re: strangest injuries

This is more a "dumb injuries" one: after installing my first extractor,
took the B**tle on a test run on some dirt roads near the house.  Went
over a bump and banged it, got loud.  Figured the muffler might be loose.
Stopped the car, went around back, grabbed the tailpipe to shake it.
Suddenly re-enacted an old ethnic joke about how many [insert group you
wish to offend] it takes to blow up a car....
