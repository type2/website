Depends on the item. Backorders on old VW parts are often a fact of life. We
deal with many of the same suppliers that the other vendors do.  Sometimes
there are several suppliers of the same part, so if one supplier is sold out
we can source from another supplier. But other times there is only one
manufacturer, so if they run out, everyone runs out (once they sell through
existing stock). At that point, whether you can get it anywhere depends on
who still has some left. Maybe at a given time we will have a few left,
whereas at other times we'll be sold out but Motorworks or someone else will
still have a few on the shelf.

That said, 3 out of 11 is a bit extreme.  I'll check on your order tomorrow
and let you know what I can. Maybe you just picked the wrong items. :-)
Then again maybe someone screwed up. I'll let you know.

As a whole, we're very caught up at the moment. Although we always say to
allow 7-10 working days for delivery, most orders are taking substantially
less than that.  If you need parts, this is a good time to order.
