Hi Jerry and Melissa

Just wanted to let you know that the 25th Anniversary Bus arrived today, and
it is a doozie! Did a good job on the graphics, and it looks so neat and
sharp. Really well pleased with it. I might  have to order another one for
my son, as he is a Hot Wheels collector, and when he sees this one, I know
he will want one.

Thanks again, and happy anniversary to two really nice people.
