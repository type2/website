Subject: New motor update, more dumb(-at-)ss findings.

Good news, turned out I learned this, check the damn valve lashes, even on a
new motor, that was 'supposed' to be ready to go. #2 exhaust was unset, as
in fully retracted, not opening, etc. This was sending the nasties and
compression into the crankcase, causing the blowing out of the oil at the
filler, and the loadness, poor running etc. Check all lashes and set to
.006. After that, no oil from undesirbale spots, the drain tube and wonton
soup container catch can was finally removed.
Still waiting on a new carb, as mine is still not trusted due to leak.
I aslo didn't have the right lugnuts to mount the rear tires (ah the joys of
unlowering), so those are on the way.
Baseline cold and unbroken in compression test resulted in 125 on both 1 and
2, 150 on both 3 and 4. Not giving this much credence, just a simple check
for ring troubles, which it seems I do not have.
If all goes well, i should finnaly have a driving bus this coming weekend,
just in time for the PA snows (so I can put it away).
Best regards to all
Al
