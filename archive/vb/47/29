My metal shop teacher in high school was a stickler for proper tool use
and safety.  One day he was violating his own tenents and was holding an
item in his hand while tightening a screw.  The screwdriver slipped and
pierced the palm of his hand, emerging out the back..

Never one to avoid a "teachable moment", he called the class together and
gave us a lesson in _exactly_ why you never hold something in one hand and
work on it with a screwdriver in the other!

A lesson I won't soon forget!
