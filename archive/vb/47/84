Subject: Ordering from Bus Depot??

You folks that have order parts from Bus Depot; How long does it usually
take to have an order completed?  I ordered 11 items on or around 17 Sept 01
and as of today I've only received 3 of the items.  I had to call to get the
magazine sent ahead.  I was told then the order should be completed in 2
weeks, well that was 3 weeks ago.  During that time the Jackpoint came in.
Is this normal?  I'm starting to think the savings isn't worth the wait.  A
month to a month and a half would have been understandable.

Dave
