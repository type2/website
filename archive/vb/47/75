Hello, Hello,

I am just scoping out sources for a good side tent.  I will be giving this
tent allot of use, so I am not concerned with getting a 'correct' tent, but
rather a good RELIABLE tent.  Looking at past posts, I found the site:

http://EuroCampers.com

Has anyone purchased one of their tents?  Good/Bad experiences?

Thanks again.
