Subject: Dateline NBC Tonight-VW Bus Story

On several Friday discussions about spotting VW busses, the commercial
of the guys in the white/red split going to all the ballparks has been
brought up several times.

My lady friend told me she just saw a promo for tonight's Dateline NBC. 
Apparently the commercial was art (?) imitating life.  The real guys
going to all the baseball parks sued the people doing the commercial. 
Depending on your time zone, I think I am giving advance notice to watch
tonight instead of letting everyone know after the fact.
