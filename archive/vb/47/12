Subject: Sam's Webpage updated

In the transfer to Geocities sans banners, I have updated my new site
The toy links are now updated with the Pan Am singlecab that I got in Germany 
this year, an egg cup & salt_n_pepper shakers
The show links are updated but are skinnied down to concentrate on trucks
My singlecab keeps on making very slow progress.
Happy bussing
