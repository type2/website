Sweet!
Nice work Boyd!  Sorry to hear that you had these troubles.  It was great
having you here for the campout and we sincerely hope that this won't
prevent you from coming next year!  Kinda makes me think that maybe having a
loaner engine would be a good thing.  It maybe coulda got you home anyhow.
Hmmm.
