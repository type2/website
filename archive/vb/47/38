Subject: [VB] 2002 Bus Calendar?

As we approach the holiday season, a glance at the 2001 bus calendar on
my wall tells me that... uh, oh, pretty soon 2001 will be over!  I would
sure hate to have to go back to another ho-hum Beetle calendar for
2002.  Sam Toll, are you still out there?  Care to give it another go as
editor/publisher?  If not, anyone else have an idea on how the list can
produce a new one?  2002 is just around the corner.
