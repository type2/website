Good point, I was thinking of auto repair accidents only, not all auto
accidents.

BTW, your data was slightly flawed.  If you resubmit your query to list the
top 20, you'll see firearm murders are 12,102 for 1998, which is more
applicable to the quote you provided, which indicated "shot on purpose," not
accidental deaths.

I wonder if that 12,102 includes the 50 kids I have "unintentionally" killed
for riding those motorized scooters...

And WTF is with all the poisioning deaths?

Don't believe everything you see on TV.  Starting from
http://webapp.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/leadcaus.html , take the defaults
and click "submit request".  In the far right column you'll see that
"Unintentional Injury and Adverse Effects" was the 5th leading cause
of death in 1998 for all age groups combined.  If you click on that
blue box, you get a breakdown which includes:

Motor Vehicle Traffic  42,191  43.1%
Firearm                   866   0.9%

Of course, this is for the United States only.  If you include other
places in the world like Colombia, Northern Ireland, the Middle East,
and California, the relative proportions are probably different.
