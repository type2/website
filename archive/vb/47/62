Thanks for the tip!  I'll have to check around some more; I didn't see
one at NAPA where I got the oil.  A Sta-lube gallon of 85W90 will fit
under the Bus by itself, but if the pump sticks up very much it may not
fit - you might have to put the gallon jug under there, and then put
the pump in it.

I did do at least one thing right - I warmed up the oil before I started.
I put a couple of pieces of 2x6 on edge and sat the gallon jug on them,
and put a 100 watt drop light under the jug, between the 2x6s.  Warmed
it up nicely.  If you don't have a fancy engine heater, the same drop
light under the sump overnight will make it a bit easier to start your
Bus in the winter time.
