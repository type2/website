I normally don't allow my air- and water-cooled lives to cross, but I
wanted to point out an unbelievable injustice that is being done to a
fellow VW owner (and his fiancee) down in Georgia.

Take some time to check out this thread:

I see quite a bit of unusual stuff on that site, but have been
consistently amazed at how many people from all automotive circles are
joining up just to post their concern and support. Heart-warming...

Take care,
