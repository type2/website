Don't believe everything you see on TV.  Starting from 
http://webapp.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/leadcaus.html , take the defaults
and click "submit request".  In the far right column you'll see that
"Unintentional Injury and Adverse Effects" was the 5th leading cause
of death in 1998 for all age groups combined.  If you click on that
blue box, you get a breakdown which includes:

Motor Vehicle Traffic  42,191  43.1%
Firearm                   866   0.9%

Of course, this is for the United States only.  If you include other
places in the world like Colombia, Northern Ireland, the Middle East,
and California, the relative proportions are probably different.
