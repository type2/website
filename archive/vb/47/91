Subject: Re: [VB] Ordering from Bus Depot??

I've had mixed results Last time I ordered from bus depot, I got two of
three items much faster than anticipated, the last item, my reason for
placing an order never came. I didnt find out untill I had called twice that
it never would. And the guy I spoke with insisted I had been called. funny,
I never talked to anyone, and I never got a message on my machine either.
not even an apology from the guy I was talking to. very disappointing
service. the time before that I got every thing in one shot and within the
specified time frame.
