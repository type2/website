I just changed the transmission oil in my bug with Redline MT 90.  I 
carefully removed the drain plug and let the old oil drain.  Put the plug 
back in with virtually no spillage.  Bought a funnel with a long hose on it.  
Put the hose in the transmission fill hole and carefully poured the MT90 into 
the funner (it flows slowly).  The only spillage was when the transmission 
was full and oil started to run out of the fill hole.  I did take off the 
left rear tire to give me some working room.  I have found this method to be 
the easiest way to handle the foul smelling gear oil.
