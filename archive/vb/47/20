Not a serious one but as a young child my father while working on his race
car asked me to help him for a minute.  I was working in the yard and was
in my shorts with no shirt or shoes.  I went into the shop and he handed me
a spark plug wire.  It was connected to the race car engine at the time. 
He precedes to crank the engine over and knocked me across the shop.  He
thanked me.  He said he wanted to see if he had any spark.  that was the
last time I blindly did what my father asked me to do.
