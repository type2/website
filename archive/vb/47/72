Subject: Double Cab Canvas

Good News -- I have found a source for making the DC canvas for the hoops on
your Truck. The material is one of the best out there "Sunbrella". the cost
is around $550 and I'm having one made for my 1960DC. Good news so far and
will let you know the outcome--

Bad news -- The person that is making them has been burned on several
occasions by non-paying VW people--But will make them for me and Only
through me--i can deal with that--After i get mine done i will take some
pics and let you know--Then if there is an interest in the DC canvas i will
have it made for you--That is the best i can do at this time--
Shipping will be from Phoenix , AridZona--stay tuned--if interested PLMK by
E-mail-- TWWM, uj
