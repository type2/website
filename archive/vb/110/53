Hi John,
It is more of a Goldie Locks "Just right." situation.  For more HP with no 
considerations for longevity one just needs more advance and/or higher 
compression ratio.  For an engine to run cooler where ultimate HP is not the 
primary concern one needs less advance and/or lower compression ratio.  
Though there is a point where too low of CR and/or timing advance will 
overheat an engine along with poor HP and torque output!
