Hi Jason,
Definitely check out the type2 library for our 1972-79 MC conversion or check 
out Hemmings Motor News magazine for shops that bore, press in a stainless or 
brass sleeve, and rebuild your old brake cylinders.

Someone else did a good write up on that!  It sounds like a huge amount of 
work, but it is well worth it when done and the shifting is so nice and 
tight.  Make sure to replace the shift tube end seals also to keep the new 
grease in and the dirt, sand, water out!

It depends on which make of antennia and where it is mounted.  Easiest way is 
to center mount a two base antennia which will help lock your front emblem 
on.  Otherwise it is Hirshmann antennia time which have a wasp shaped solid 
metal at the base of the mast which is meant to be bent.
