.050 stays comes in a little sooner than a .009 but I feel it is better on
the bottom end. I have heard people say bad things about them, but they were
using them for the wrong reason. A daily grocery getter would benefit from
one, a street racer would not.

Thanks Eric and Ray, What are the 050 specs? I heard these were bad news on
