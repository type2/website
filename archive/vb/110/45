Subject: IRS on a Splitbus "again" ;-) with a Prosche 914 gearbox

OK here we go again....I'm looking for part to my project...IRS'ing a Split=
bus..

A Porsche 914 gearbox pop'ed up in a classified in Denmark. I don't know if=
 it's a gearbox to 4 cylinder or a 6 cylinder porsche and I don't even know=
 if there are any difference.

I might be able to get some numbers if it's necesarry, but how will it fit =
into my project, instead of a 1303s gearbox.

The engine to pull all this will be a 1914 T1 with a single carburator.
