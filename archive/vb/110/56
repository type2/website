Hi Robert,
Good question!  Clara would be the expert on that,  since she is busy with 
school we will give it a swing at it.  There were differances in the steering 
locks over the years.  Most of these changes are small and these locks will 
fit on 1955ish through 1967 buses.  For 1967 the locks came without the 
Garage, Farht, Start positions cast into the ring/circle around the tumbler 
and had a differant key pattern.  The biggest problem with the 55-67 locks is 
the tumblers crack on both sides of the key slot and collapse.
