I'm on your side, Sears is 15 miles away from me, a tool truck usually
charges premium prices and you and I both got our jobs done when we wanted
and we saved a few bucks.
Let 'em say what they want.

Well, fluids all changed out on the '65 and replaced using the nuts and
bolts method.
My search for the same tools only took 47 seconds, but to get them here
would have taken a week, and since I had the day off, and the wheels off, I
wanted
to do it now.  Yes, Sears had the 17mm allen for $8.00, and if I had seen
the snap-on
guy while driving, I would have stopped him. I searched the archives for any
mention of
someone else sharing this, and found none.(didn't want to waste bandwidth)
I then posted the original so it would be easy to find in the archives, and
maybe help someone else out in a pinch. Geez, it sounds like in the
meantime, I made myself into a webdummycheapskate.  I don't care though,
because I am a cheapskate, and
a splittie alot of people would have chopped up now rolls and stops.
