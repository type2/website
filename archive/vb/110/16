Subject: shock question



Today thought i would put shocks on the bus. pulled off the front ones and 
realized i had the wrong shock. or so i thought. actually they turned out to 
be the exact same shock, but the bottom part wont fit on the stud. it is too 
small of a hole. I noticed that the PO cut out the smaller hole in the 
center of the bushing to allow the old shock to fit. I don't want to do 
this. Is there a correct shock for my bus? It's a 67 13 window deluxe.
thanks
john
