For 1600 sp with a 24mm venturi Solex or similar carb** I think you want a 113
905 205 M or T, simple single vacuum advance, used on a lot of type 1 engine
baywindow busses. They are all pretty old at this point, check it out well
before plugging it in. 009 maybe isn't the best choice, but for $50 new and
unwornout it is not a bad choice either.
I think carb and dizzy go hand-in-hand, a different set for each different
engine displacement. 30PICT2 and 3 carbs were designed for 1600sp, M and T
(interchangeable, I think?) dizzy completes the set. I have come to consider the
Brosol H30/31 to be the 30PICT4 carb and treat it much like a 30PICT3, that's my
opinion.
** All bets are off if you have a hot cam or webber carb or the like.

I recently got a pile of M and T dizzies from a listee in NY, I am interested in
rebuilding them, seeing how many I can save. Does anyone have any advice for me
on rebuilding these, what parts are still available for them?
