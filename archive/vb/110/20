Subject: New VB owner with some first questions

Hello,
I just got my first VB and the body is better than i thought that it was
going to be but the wiring is a complete mess. I turn the key and absolutely
nothing. I don't get any warning lights come on but i do get headlights. I
check the bulbs in the speedo and they are still 6v. The engine is engine
code AM017279 which i think means that it is a Mexican 1600 engine. The
choke is 12V.The coil looks like a dirty Bosch blue coil. I was told that
the bus was running a year earlier but having problems with the starter. The
engine looks fairy clean with all new tune-up parts on it. it turns nicely
and you can feel that it has compression. The carb looks like it says solex

What year of wiring diagram should i try to follow?
Is there a way to verify that the generator is 12V?
Is there such thing as a 6volt blue coil?
Is there a way to verify that the starter is 12v?
Should i try to wire it myself or should i purchase a new harness?

thanks a bunch,
