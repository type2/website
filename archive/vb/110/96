When I first got my current bus, it had Kadrons, and an 050 distributor in
it. The thing ran like a top, and pulled strong from the bottom end all the
way up.

Also, there's no ports for vacuum advance on the Kduds, so you would have to
do that all yourself, and hope you get it right.  If you don't have a vac
advance dizzy with your Kduds already, don't sweat it, they run pretty
damned good with just an 050.  (I would imagine pretty good with a 009, but
havent done that combo, so i'll let someone else chime in on that one that
has the experience with that setup.)
