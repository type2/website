Let us know what you find out. I need some of those shiny panel clips too,
and (I'm sure) so do others on the list.

I have been doing some work on my passenger door, which required removing
the door panel. Of course some of the clips broke on removal and I need
replacements.

I was given an NOS box of 50 of these clips 261 867 615B, but the clip
appears to be about 2mm short when compared to the old ones. Because of this
the clips will not catch onto the metal of the door to hold the panel. I
understand replacements from Wolfsburg West have the same problems.

What are my options?? Find old and used? Is there another source?? Is there
an easy way to remove the old style clips without breaking them??
