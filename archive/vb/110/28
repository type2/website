Yah, yah... I was just havin' fun :-)  I *would* like to hear from those
whose buses I worked on... did you get home OK?

And the feeble, last minute efforts I made on Saturday have inspired
me...  At High Country Bus Festival (with permission from Mike/Buddha), I
would like to run a formal clinic on "How to set your dwell, timing, and
check your vacuum"  I will post further on this tomorrow, as it is closing
in on 3AM and I just got home and am near-delirious form exhaustion.

I have some ideas, some questions, and would like to recruit some
victi/////...  err... volunteers :-) on running a basic "keep your bus
engine alive" seminar.

I would also like to collect some old distributors and carbs, as examples
and teaching tools.  At the very least, if you are coming to HCBF, plan on
scooping all the old distributors and carbs, dead or not, out of your
parts boxes.  Maybe we can line up for an ID and diagnosis session....
what is it?  what is it good for? and how does it do what it is supposed
to do?

Anyhow, it is late... errr... early, and I am collapsing as I typ(o)e....
excuse the lousy keyboard work :-)  I'll post something more readable
tomorrow, I promise!

> Nikki for almost getting there.

:-( But she *is* on her way, thanks to Art Long and David Schwarze! :-)
The latest news is that she is headed east after a carb clinic by David
Schwarze.  Speaking of which... David...  coming to HCBF?  Wanna run a
clinic on carbs????  Or anyone (oh, say...  Mr. Dearing :-) want to sub?
I am OK on FI, but you can search the archives in vain for posts by me on
carbs!  I am hopeless on them and would love to attend a seminar on them
at a campout.
