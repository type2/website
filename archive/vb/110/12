Subject: Rebuilt transmission brake in procedure?

Now that my single cab is back on the road I am running through all the
routine maintenance that I can think of.  When the engine died a couple of
years ago I got the transmission rebuilt as it was popping out of gear.  I
got the transmission installed back then but then it sat for a couple of
years until now.  I did replace the gear oil in the tranny and redux boxes
with the proper GL4 type.  Is there an accepted procedure for breaking in a
rebuilt tranny?  When should I change the gear oil for the first time?

Thanks,

Thomas
