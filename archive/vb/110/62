Could be you have a bad positive connection and/or no grounding wires running 
from each rear taillight to where the battery ground strap bolts to the body.

Correct unless you find a special built switch for changing from one power 
source to another.  If you are big into camping you might want to look into a 
battery isolation relay to have a second battery for use when parked/camping 
that automaticly charges when running the engine, but does not allow the 
starting battery to run down at all!  Or do what we do and keep the radio 
turned up enough to always hear it, and if you need to turn it down just turn 
it OFF.  Eric&Barb
