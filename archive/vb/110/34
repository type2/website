Subject: rebuilding distributor

   Howdy. While having a fantastic time at Everybus, I picked up      
several dusty old vacuum advance distributors. Having confirmed a     
couple of them as being suitable for my bus & truck, I would like to  
get 2 of them in suitable operating condition to replace the 2 009's I
am currently running. Having rebuilt engines and other mechanical     
work, I am fairly confident in my ability to do this, but was         
wondering if anyone had any tips/pointers/advice to give me on the    
subject, things to look for, tolerances for shaft wear, etc. Also, I  
can find sources for points, condensers, caps and rotors, but are     
there other parts, bushings, seals, etc that I would need to replace, 
and if so, sources for those items, especially the vacuum canisters.  
Any leads greatly appreciated. Thanks,
