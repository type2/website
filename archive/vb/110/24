I have been doing some work on my passenger door, which required removing the door panel. Of course some of the clips broke on removal and I need replacements.

I was given an NOS box of 50 of these clips 261 867 615B, but the clip appears to be about 2mm short when compared to the old ones. Because of this the clips will not catch onto the metal of the door to hold the panel. I understand replacements from Wolfsburg West have the same problems.

What are my options?? Find old and used? Is there another source?? Is there an easy way to remove the old style clips without breaking them??
