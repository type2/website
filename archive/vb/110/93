The timing with my 009 would start to 'scatter' once the rpms got over 3K.
I switched to my Mallory unit, and it holds rock steady all the way up to
7500 rpm (different motor!).

I think it's a quality control issue.  My 009 was less than a year old, and
was probably as precise as a unit 20 years old.   :-)
