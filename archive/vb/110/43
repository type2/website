Subject: Welder ?

Hey everyone,

I am looking to get a argon gas MIG setup.

I was wondering if anyone has had experience with a Matco brand 110v welder?
Apparently it is fairly heavy duty with a good amps output (over 100), but
definitely will not be better or equal to a Miller or Lincoln.

It is used (traded in for a bigger Lincoln unit) and comes with warrantee
from the seller.  Price $250.  When/if I upgrade I can trade in that unit
again for the full amount and apply it to the new units price.  Seems like a
good deal to me, what do you all think?

Of course I will need to add onto that gas, wire, mask ($200ish ouch - for
the flicker screen), and the little crud.

I would have gone for a new Miller or Lincoln 110v, but that was like
$550... OUCH!  

     
Thanks,
Adrian S. Pillow
