> Well, the fun and games are over.  For now anyways.  Being that this was
> my first EveryBus, I promised myself that I would take pictures to
> remember the event.  I was not disappointed.  My engine, as a lot of
> people already knew, was running pretty bad.  Friday morning I managed
> to limp to Linville, NC on three cylinders to meet up with Doc Ric and
> everyone from the Roan Mt. carabus. Ric and others took a look and we
> ended up fixing the problem by just swapping the injectors on cylinders
> 1 and 2.  What gives??  So we head to Greensboro and the bus runs fine,
> although Ric's had a heating problem that would continue through the
> trip home.  I got to EB with the intention of still dropping my engine
> to replace the rear main seal and some other stuff.  However, after some
> thinking through, I decided that I would hold off because I do not have
> enough money to buy more parts if we ran into other problems.  I do
> thanks all those that volunteered to help me.  Now, with Steve Dolan's
> expert advice that I still had a vacuum leak  (eeerrrrrrrrrrr!!!!), I
> set out shortly to replace my injector seals with ones that were given
> to me by Mike (to the man that gave them to me, correct me if I got your
> name wrong).  Will also be replacing the fuel lines in that area with
> some that Mr. Dolan gave me.  I am sort of annoyed at myself because out
> of all the tools floating around there, including the ones that Jason

> will stop running off now and just let you know that all the pics I took
> can be viewed at www.wicals.com <http://www.wicals.com/>  .   One last
> thanks to Doc Ric, Steve Dolan, Jason LASTER, Mad Uncle Dave, all those
> from the Roan Mt. carabus, Mike-for the injector seals, Mike Benthin,
> and everyone else that helped me out while I was there.  For our first
> trip, my family was very impressed and happy to meet all those that we
> have been talking to on the list.  We look forward to all the other
> events and will do what we can to make those as well.  Thanks everyone,
> and happy busing.
