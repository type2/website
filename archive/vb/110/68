Subject: still more brake light probs

Allright i did the test with the two wires down at the master cylinder. when 
i touched the hot one with the not hot one, my brake lights came on. when i 
put my test light to the not hot one and pulled down on the brake, nothing 
happened. so my switch is bad? also i put my test light to the relay inside 
the bus where the brake light is connected(I was touching the terminal where 
the brake light wire connected to the relay). now when i hit my brakes my 
light comes on! so what on earth is going on? does the pressure switch work 
or not?
hmmmm
thanks
john
