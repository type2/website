Hi Jason

For your master cylinder, contact Wolfgang Int'l.  They sell an adapter($40)
which allows you to use a 73-79 MC ($40) I just put one on  my 67 std bus a
couple of weeks ago.  works great, and in the future I can just use the $40
MC if I ever need to replace.  You will need to use your old reservoir or
purchase a new one, but they just snap in place.

Bob
