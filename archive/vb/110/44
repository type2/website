Subject: FW: [VB] Welder ?

When buying a welder, always consider where you will get replacement
parts...i.e.-tips, nozzle, gun liner, drive rolls
Alot of welders made by Snap-on, Matco and craftsman are Miller/Lincoln
welders with a different paint job. 
All Miller welders start their seriel number with 2 letters followed by 6
numbers.
Lincoln welders start with a U followed by a whole slew of numbers.
