Hi Glenn,
If this is your 56 bus, and you can not find any evidence of the harness 
having been replaced by a DPO use the 1956 wiring harness diagram.

There should be a line of stamped numbers and letters on its circumferance 
near the fan shroud.  Find that line and post it to the list.

>>Is there such thing as a 6volt blue coil?

Yes, there most certainly is!

> Is there a way to verify that the starter is 12v?

Yes, remove it and look for the stamped ID numbers in its side and on the 
side of the solinoid.

Depends.  If the wiring harness shows no sign of heavy electrical wiring 
fire, then repairing the harness with sections of wire from other dead VWs is 
fine as long as you use quality brass clips crimped on with a special tool 
and solder, heat shrink any wires together for future fail safe repairs.
