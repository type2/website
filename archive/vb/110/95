yeah, i would only run the german 009s till i ran out of stable ones... i
had ONE decent brazillian one that finally chewed thru the fibre washer and
got too much play... need to rebuild that 'un, too.

i heard at a swapmeet that you should "buy the chrome 009s cuz they might
have better quality control on the shiny ones!"  LOL!!
