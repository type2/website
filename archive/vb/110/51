You don't want straight argon gas for steel, get 75/25 gas,(75%argon /25%
co2), I think its called cougar or something like that.
Had a blast at EB enjoyed meeting the masses of folks new and also our old
friends as well.  If anyone took pics of the Binz please send to me so i can
post on the site if you don't mind the credit to your photo skills. I had my
camera and totally brain farted and didn't snap a pic at all, derrrrr,,
