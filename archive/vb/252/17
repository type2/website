Why not just rig up some AC lights. Seems you could find some kind of 
bulb that would be very close to the bus ones. Flood lights or 
something. Just put a dimmer switch on them. Cheap. Would make life 
much easier for sure.

That's the way I'd do it.

Oh yeah, my friend just lights up the little parking lights on the 
sides of the inside of the headlight housing. He uses AC bulbs and 
they give the perfect glow to the lights. One of these days I'll take 
pictures of his shop sign. I donated the '59  nose to him for it. 
I've got another nose in my barn that I'm gonna make into a display 
of some kind eventually. Just can't decide if I want it on the inside 
or outside of my new workshop.
