Hi Andres,
40 HP through 1600 were all the same pressurewise.

We do it off the idiot light circuit with a brass X-fitting we machine from a 
T-fitting.  The best place for the oil temp is probably in one of the engine 
case plugs just downstream of the oil pump or perhaps we will sometime put the 
oil temp sender in the oil filter/pumps we use.
