That sounds like a cross between "Divine Right's Trip" and the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.  I recall at least one FFFB episode ending with a 
<foom!> as a tumbleweed ignites under the bus.  Actually pretty amazing that I remember *any* FFFB episode....

"Divine Right's Trip" is a pretty interesting read.  Amazon lists it at http://tinyurl.com/endi.  Or google it for some reviews.  I found a used copy and 
would definitely recommend it, both because of and in spite of its strangeness.
