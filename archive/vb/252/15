Hi Sean,
Another idea just came to us is to take a couple of seam beam bulbs and 
carefully break out the rear tip where the electrical connections are.  Once this 
area is removed wire in some 20 Watt single filament bulbs inside the remains 
of the sealed beam bulbs.  Or get some cheapie H-4s and drop in the same low 
Wattage bulbs usually used for taillights.  You still will need a battery and 
battery charger, but the lighting system will run longer and better.
