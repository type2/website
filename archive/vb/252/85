Subject: speaker placement

I know this topic has been beat (pun intended) to death, but I have a
potential stealthy install question.  Since I have a panel, and am planning to
build my own divider, has anyone ever mounted their speakers in the divider
panel?  Cover the front of the divider and that would be pretty stealthy to
me.  You would have to do something with the backside as well to prevent
prying eyes from the rear window.  Just curious if anyone has any experience
with that setup.
