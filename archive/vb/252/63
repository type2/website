Hi Paul,
Do you have the driver 1/3 seat adjusted properly???  There should be two 
adjstment knobs at the base/hinge area where the upper section of the seat meets 
the base part.  These knobs should be adjusted so the seat back is straight up 
or even slightly tilted forward.

You can definitely do it yourself!
