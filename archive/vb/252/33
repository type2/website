Headlights draw about 60W each, so they will draw roughly 10A or 10,000ma.
Way too much for that converter.  Radio Shack isn't noted for hiring
electrical experts!

My solution would be to get a couple of non-sealed-beams (cheap-o H4
headlights leap to mind) and install a couple of 7W christmas tree bulbs
in them.  That way they'll run on 110V directly.  Make sure that the
sockets and wiring are workmanlike!

A second approach is to get a couple
of regular sealed beam bulbs and carefully cut the glass backs to allow
you to insert the christmas tree bulb.  This would be more difficult, but
cheaper.
