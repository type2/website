You all probably know all about this, but if you'll just indulge my 
enthusiasm:

i've had a delightful time (re)discovering that a stock geared '61 bus 
shouldn't be run much over 55mph (57.59) at an arbitrary max rpm of 
3500 with my H78-15's.
1961's Without Guesswork states "around 3700" for 56 mph on a stock 
tired (as in pneumatic, not wheezing) bus...i guess i like tyred 
better, but my auto-spell-checker balks. This is for the 30hp engine.

so next question:
What is a safe max extended use (as in highway driving) rpm for a stock 
1500 in good shape? By good shape i mean even compression, good valve 
clearance, all cooling tin there, very slight gaps in engine seal 
rubber, stock mixture in the carb, fresh oil, say outside temp in the 
60's? I realize that it is a very arbitrary question, and i do 
understand that each engine has it's own sweet spot, but what has been 
your experience?
thanks,
Andres
