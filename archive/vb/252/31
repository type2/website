Subject: RGB Rebuild (Reduction Boxes)

VintageVolks,

So, it looks like I'm going to need to rebuild or replace an RGB on my 
1967 kombi:  lots of axial play, leaking lots of diff oil, metal shavings 
(??!) when I drained it, etc.

I've read the archives (mostly posts from Eric&Barb :) so I have an idea 
of what I'm getting myself into, but I have a couple of questions:

	a) it seems like I have to remove weld/drill&screw-out the plug on
		the inner RGB half in order to remove it: is this the case
		or can i pull the RGB and disassemble on the bench?

	b) sounds like i may or may not need a bearing puller: is there a 
		size I should shoot for in renting one, or...

	c) along these lines, if I wanted to replace the RGB instead of 
		rebuilding, would I need the above tools, or will it just
		pop right off?
		
	d) are there other gotchas to be concerned about?

I'm planning on rebuilding both RGBs at once, although I have a source for 
two used RGBs which I might just pick up and pop on if it's easier, while 
waiting until I have time to rebuild mine.  Thoughts on this?

I do have the Bentley's, but I confess, most of the scanning I did of the 
rebuild process has already slipped through my brain.

I've been hemming and hawing on doing this because of time issues and the 
fact that I have a running bus right now, but I'm getting to the point 
where I'm ready to do it and I want to get an idea of what I'm getting 
into before I go for it.  

Thanks,
	tom
