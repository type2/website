I don't have it handy here at work, but the spec book talks about
these intakes. IIRC it was an m-code option for quite a while,
eventually just made standard for all busses making the trip
down-under. It's design apparently is more for clean air than cool
air. You guys with your dry dusty conditions apparently kept killing
engines :) this was used to hopefully keep dust & dirt out of there.

I can't imagine it would get that much hotter. so any pics of how the
air is ducted to the engine?
