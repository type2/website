Hi Tom,
Either you have a pig hiding in a strange place or have a throw out bearing 
that either needs repacking with grease, or replacing if worn out.
  We had the same problem recently with a NOS TO bearing that we even 
repacked with new grease before installing.  It would squeal if the pedal was pushed 
down for more than about 15 seconds at a time.  After a couple of weeks of 
driving it seems to have worn in, best guess is that it was a bit tight.
