Subject: RE: [VB] popouts on a dc

  VW was thinking of the future and knew how everyone would have to pay MEGA
bucks for an original latch, but wait the market will be flooded with them
in a week or so after everyone gets back from BC with handfuls of them.
Being it's a 2 year only thing there isn't much demand for them overseas
(how many early DC have you seen from Europe?). I also heard the Wolsburg
Museam store had boxes full. If you do need one now BRAX VW salvage has a
box full of them in Montana

Nope.  Double cabs have this goofy latch that mounts perpendicular
to the frame.  Early barndoor buses had this as well.

Nobody has ever been able to explain to me *why*
