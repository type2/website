Subject: Gearing Computations

Ok, with all this talk of gearing, and the fact that I've been thinking
about it due to the suspicion that the tranny in my '61 is not, in fact, a
freeway flier (I was told it was), I am curious enough to do a comparitave
analysis between all three of my buses.

I'll make some marks, jack up the rear ends, and check the amount of
rotaions of engine vs. wheel....in each gear.

I know I've seen it somewhere, but cannot find it now....I'm looking for the
chart(s) that tell me what I've got...based on the info I get from the
aforementioned test.

All three buses have big nut trannies...but are there differences there,
too?

Thanks,
