Hi volks,
This one's mainly for Pim but I thought you'd all be
interested.
This SC is my mates '63.
It's the beast of a thousand problems we've been
swearing at on a number of weekends.
I took these pics of the extended roof lip and scoops
which lead up into the roof.
I think these were made exclusively for Australia and
I think they supply sir to the engine
bay.....eventually.
I'm not sure how cool the sir would be after
travelling through the roof cavity and any other metal
work but check it out.
