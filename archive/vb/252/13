You could just get a 6 or 12 volt battery and an on/off switch.  Unless you
plan on leaving the headlights on for a long time, it should be fine for a
while.  Just be careful where you put the battery.  Wouldn't want people to
be kicking it, that would hurt.  Good luck.

(1000ma?) it didn't. After a few seconds the lights dimmed and then went
out. I am not intersted in blinding people I just want them to glow a bit ,
sort of like a 12 volt headlight with a 6 volt battery.
