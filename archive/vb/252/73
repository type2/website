Kevin,

You need to have 3/4" drive on your 1-13/16 socket. It's the only size
drive that will handle the torque. The torque is just at the high edge of
the 1/2" drive capability. Many 1/2" breaker bars will bend at 215 ft
lbs. Plus you need the extra capacity for those tough jobs, where a nut
is frozen on by rust.

Get a 3/4 breaker bar and a hollow piece of steel pipe to use with it as
an extender - a couple feet is enough.

I've been using my 1-13/16" 3/4" socket for decades. It works.
