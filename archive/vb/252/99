Subject: I missed the turn

I must be a speed freak.
I got my 912e taday.
Hausus christo ----------- I know that ain't spanish but that's what I
said as I made standard run to the grocery store and missed my turnoff to
get back home by nine blocks.
Jesus! That is spanish Right ?............  Guys if a 912e with a Type IV
runs like this, Please accept my application for a funeral policy and put
in in a new 911.
Gooooood it is such a rush to be in a car like this.
My Law enforcement Ford Crown Vic will excite you but it takes a minute
before the hood vacumes completely out of sight.
I don't think I made the buy f the centurty and I don't think I got
anything special here, but damn I love it.
If things don't work out send your memorial donmatioons to "The Shriners
Childerns Hospital".
I'm going for for it Bubba!
