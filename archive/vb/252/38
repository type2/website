Subject: bags are packed, ready to go

Hi All,

 

Just wanted to bid a fair well as I'm off to bad camberg in one hour,
via Seattle, NY, Brussels, Sint Job In 't Goor, and then bad camberg.  I
hear the BBT ladder truck is all ready to go.

 

Trip report pending on my return on the 27th.

 

 

 

Take care all, and keep bussing :-)

 

 

 

David
