Hi Tom,
Would help to know what year your bus is.  Pre-1960 buses do not have a 
M-code plate.  The ONLY way to check for proper VIN # is to find it stamped on the 
body inside the engine compartment just forward and right of the rear apron.  
While that one could be cut and welded in place, all other VIN #s can be just 
unscrewed and replaced.
