Subject: '61 Double Cab....6-17-03

Wife and kids are out of town 'til at least Thursday, so.....

I brought the '61 Double Cab home last night. It's not street legal, 
but we snuck it home driving it on the less traveled roads. Only 
about a mile or so to drive anyway. Seemed to have trouble shifting 
gears. I got under it today and found the shift coupler was all guey 
and no good. When I went to take it off, one of the set screws didn't 
want to come. I layed there and looked underneath the truck. The 
tranny looked good...all new tranny mounts. New axle boots, 
everything nice and clean. New brake hoses. Very nice. The shiftrod 
had freshish grease on it. I guess the coupler didn't get serviced 
because of this stuck set screw.

After wrenching on it for 1/2 hour without a budge, I broke out the 
drill. I drilled right down the center of the screw all the way to 
the rod. That was enough that when I got the vice grips on it finally 
broke loose and screwed right out.

I dug a "red urethane cylinder of death" shift coupler out of my junk 
and slapped it on. I was lying on the ground under the front of the 
bus lining up the shiftrod screw holes and took a good look at the 
front end. It LOOKS like the beam has been gone through or something. 
It's all nice and black and clean. New brake parts hoses like in the 
back. Everything looks nice until you get to the arm that connects to 
the steering. It looks half-ass installed. Need to get on that for 
sure.

You can really tell someone had plans fully restore this ugly bus.

After getting things bolted back together and  finding reverse (why 
is it that reverse is a little different in every bus I get in?).... 
I took the truck for a drive around the block. I shifted all the way 
up to third and everything was much much better, so I pulled the 
truck back in.

Success for today.

I'm gonna need to fix the emergency brake. I think the big-nut 
transaxle swap is why nothing was done there. Had that issue with my 
Kombi and will fix it the same way as I did that one.

Also need to get all the electrical including the lights working. 
Other than that I THINK it'd pass inspection. It's a "piece" if you 
know what I mean. But I'm gonna just make it all one color of flat 
gray, paint the wheels red, install a set of wide white wall tires 
and call it "Rat Rod Macaroni". At least I'll be on the road in a bus 
again.
