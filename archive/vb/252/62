Hi Kevin,
A 1/2 or less drive will not cut the mustard!!!  Look in your local phone 
book for a Proto dealer and get thier 3/4 drive breaker bar for about $35.00.  So 
far we have not even been able to even bend our's even when we had to use an 
eight foot long cheater bar on it to break free rusty axle nuts off a core 
tranny we had.  We used to use Craftman 3/4 drive breaker bars and bent and broke 
them often with only a three foot cheater bar!
