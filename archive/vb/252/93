Hi Bart,
If you are waiting till it gets hard to shift you are damaging the gears and 
syncros of the tranny with increased wear.  At that point the clutch is not 
full disengaing and wearing due to being slipped so it to is getting worn 
faster.  You need to get a feel what the clutch pedal should be when tight and 
adjust it before it hits the 1" amount of slop.
