Subject: 1960 Double Cab... 6-18-03

I decided to start working out the wiring on the 1961 Double Cab. I 
immediately noticed the fuse box was different from my other busses. 
I wanted to make sure this wasn't a '62 instead of a '61 so I went to 
the ID plate to see what story it would tell me. To my surprise it 
said this was actually a 1960 Truck! I double checked the body number 
and it matched.

So I came in and went to Thom's site ( http://www.vintagebus.com ) to 
register the truck and download the wiring diagram. I took a look at 
the fuse box that was on the truck and figured out I could use it 
even though it was a later model style. After spending about an hour 
sorting things out and trying to get the right wires the way it 
should be for a '60 model, I realized something just wasn't right.

I came back in and on a hunch downloaded the '62 wiring diagram from 
Thom's site. The wiring diagram fit the wires I had in my truck much 
much better. So it looks like a PO had replaced the wiring harness 
with one from a later model bus. I don't know what all is what as I 
just ran out of time. But I imagine I'll have to do a little creative 
wiring here or there to make things work right. No big deal. I'm an 
electronics kind of guy so this is right down my alley.

I decided to clean up all the connections on the fuse box since it 
was out of the bus. I will clean all the connectors on the ends of 
the wires tomorrow. Then I'll do my best to get things back on the 
way they should go. I did write down everything before I pulled the 
wires and it seems like that's more or less how they were on before I 
yanked 'em all.

I did find that something was wrong before I did any of this. There 
wasn't really power going to anything other than the starter and 
ignition. When I tested the fuse box yesterday it was really hard to 
get a reading on my Voltmeter so I think dirty connections and some 
bad wiring are causing problems. This will be the biggest hurdle to 
getting the Truck on the road full time. So I'm trying to stick with 
it.

I'll need to pick up some new headlight and parking light bulbs 
tomorrow. Also need to get a new flasher.

The switch for the wiper motor is messed up. Don't know if I can 
salvage it. I'll have to dig one of those up as well.

So I learned a lot today...but didn't actually accomplish anything. 
That's the way it goes!
