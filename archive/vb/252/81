Subject: re:clutch cable question

you have said that you keep adjusting it every few months...can you tell if
the adjusting nut is backing off? or cable stretching? i would imagine that
the adjusting nut is not locking into place. i know this varies a little
depending on year, but on mine the adjusting nut is a wing nut thing, with
two bumps in it, these bumps kind of fall into notches on the arm that the
cable runs through. this way the little bumps will keep the nut from
spinning off and loosening....
