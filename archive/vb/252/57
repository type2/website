The chassis number on the ad (738665) is in the VintageBus Registry.
It appears to have been put there by Bruce, the guy who just bought it.
He listed two M-codes, 139 and 376.  He also listed the model, but
there's no way to tell if that came from the plate or not.  In general,
the body details seem to match the chassis number.

On the picture looking in the passenger cab door, what's that hook just
outboard of the seat back?  That looks like something that would maybe
go with a camper (hammock attachment?) rather than a Deluxe.

It seems to have the "narrow" back hatch for a corner-window Bus, but
the glass is almost the full width of the hatch.  Is that a Samba
thing?  (Standards had the "narrow" hatch but a small window; I don't
think the glass got bigger until the whole hatch did.)

The engine compartment picture is interesting.  For that much coin,
I'd want less ripples in the engine seal, better placement on the
oil cooler, and the original air cleaner.  :)  It has a dual-port
manifold and is also a clean-air engine, which didn't happen until
December 1962.
