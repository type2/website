Subject: Bus books

I have about 8 of the German 48-67 VW Transporter "Bus Books" I'm selling

I know David Mayes and Greg Noble have seen this book and can vouch for 
how many off the wall Buses are in it.

It has just about every different configuration VW every did with a VW 
Bus in it. Lots of pictures, German text.

I'm selling them for $50 each on the Samba, but will do $40 for list 
members.

Here's a link to the Samba ad .
