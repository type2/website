Subject: Re: [VB] TO bearing - engine pull - ??'s

Hi Volks,
Also make sure to lightly apply grease to the side of the tip of the tranny 
input shaft each time just before you install the engine so as to automaticly 
grease the needle bearings inside the FW gland bolt.  Plus always make sure the 
TO bearing is equal side to side in relation to the tranny input shaft.  The 
TO arms can be bend a tiny bit, but if more is needed you need to shim the TO 
shaft over to one side.  This is also a good time to install the 1968-71 
larger bus gas tank, and reserve switch if you do not have one!
