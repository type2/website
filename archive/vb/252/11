Hi Sean,
I think 1000 milliamps (1 amp, around 12 watts) is way too little., 
unless you are only going to turn on the running lights...
You'd probably be better off with a much heavier duty converter, or 
hook up a battery to the lights and one of those S*ms Club or 
equivalent automatic battery chargers.
I live in a 60's Streamline travel trailer and am now hooked to the 
local grid but like to use all the 12 volt stuff inside also, so i run 
everything off the battery, whilst simultaneously charging it with the 
charger from the trailer's 110 (which comes from a transformer, since 
Chile is 220...)
As far as brightness goes, you could use low-wattage bulbs or wire a 12 
volt rheostat in line with the lead to the lights.
HTH,
Andres
btw, how does one cc. someone on the list?
