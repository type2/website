Hi Tom,
The only way to remove the RGB from the tranny center section without 
destroying parts is to remove engine, remove tranny and then dissassemble the RGBs.

Just wait till you get in there and find out if you really need a puller.  We 
have been able to remove the bearings with common hand tools without speacial 
pullers.

Go ahead and get them for spare parts.  RGBs are most likely the next spare 
parts that are going to dry up for our buses.

Do not try to memorize the proceedures in Bentley, just take it one step at a 
time.

Just do it and install all new ball bearings.  If any of the old ball 
bearings are in good shape you can use them as spares.  That way if you do it now and 
correctly you will not have to do it again for 100,000+ miles of reliable 
driving.  The only RGB bearings we will actually reuse is the lower outer roller 
bearings if they inspect as good and they are real easy to inspect.
