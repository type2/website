Matt,  other volks,

Isn't that a Ski Ewtah licence plate on the front?  There was a red
one
like that up in Alpine a few years ago.  The guy showed up for our
first
Utah Valley Volks Wagon Club Family Reunion.  Had a nice red checkered
picknic cloth in the back hatch along with 60's picnic paraphernalia,
including a coke ice chest.  Sweet.

Curt
