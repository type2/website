Subject: Re: [VB] Bus books

On a slightly unrelated note to Greg's email, I have to rave about this book someone on 
another list suggested.  It's called _Blue Highways_, was written around 1982, and is 
this great travel journal of a guy who just takes off one day in his F*rd van and drives all 
over the little tiny two-lane highways of America.  Very cool!
