That "ugly bubble roof", as you say, on the Aussie version has another
purpose.  The double wall roof insulates the passenger compartment from
the sun beating down from above.  Typical VW to make the same structure
perform two tasks!

I achieve the same cooling effect with a
full-length roof rack and a sheet of 1/4 plywood painted white.

It's good for about 10 degrees on a hot summer day.
