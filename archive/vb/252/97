do all seats have this adjustment knob? I have never seen this, nor any
remnants of it on the seats of my '65 kombi(camper conversion to ez-camper).

Hi Eric&Barb,

Once again you have come to my rescue - this was indeed the problem.  Never
even noticed that adjustment before!  Adjusted it and it feels so much nicer
to drive!  Mine were at odd positions too - doubt that would of helped.

Well as I have ordered the new padding I might as well do it now anyway.

Thanks
