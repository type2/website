Yea, I love how much plastic filler they use on thier bodywork. Pop riveting
aluminum over the rust holes and laying filler down over that was pretty bad.
I saw one where they added a hood kit to a Chevy Luv, and holy cow, that
filler must have been 1" thick! I can't imagine how many times the hood will
be closed before the whole thing crashes off of that thing. I used 1 quart of
filler on my entire 62 bug, most of which got sanded off. I bet they get thier
filler in 5 gallon buckets by the pallet.

And like you say Mario, this is the stuff they let national television see,
who knows how bad it gets on the stuff you don't get to see. My 79 westy looks
pretty bad as it is, but I sure as hell wouldn't let them touch my ride.

  It made me more then cringe Eric I can't imagine if that the quality they do
on national TV, then I'm sure its the same for everything else.
  I will continue to say I have never done such crap work on any of the
restorations I have ever done. But I have seen that type of work done on a bug
that was recently featured in one of the VW mags.

  my new slogan should be
  If anyone in this group is looking for a professional restoration e-mail me
and I will do far better quality then seen on TV.
