Subject: Re: [VB] Steering boxes

   The new Brazilian steering boxes that I have now come with the correct pitman arm (they didn't before). You will 
need to take the mounting/frame collar and have it machined to fit over the nose of the box (they used to come with 
the correct  mounting collar) and you could use a bay pitman arm
