I used to be in the film business and did lots of commercials. When we did a 
set everyone knew that whatever stood up or hung on the wall only needed to 
last, at the most, 30 seconds. We used lots of tape. That was how much 
effort was put into parts of the set, no more.

That kid struck me as kind of a goober and if I were him I would sell the 
dryer, the TV, pretty much all of that electrical system, that surfboard 
ejection wierdness, etc. That could bring him about $10,000 And he could 
afford to repair the louvre damage and the dash damage, take the interior 
out carefully, fix all the interior rust, put the interior back(?), have the 
engine and all the mechanicals worked on and he'd have a very nice bus. 
Maybe he should just sell it now before the rust gets back to the surface.
