Hi Coerver,
Depends!!  Did you take off the brake backing plate?  If so, one  of the 
square paper gaskets goes there between the backing plate and the axle  tube.  
Very slight leakage could be due to the seal seating onto the inner  spacer.  If 
it continues for more than a month then we would take it apart  again and 
inspect for the cause.

>>BTW: I used a floor jack and a breaker bar to loosen the 46mm  axle nut... 
works great <<
 
Just do not retorque that way!!!!
