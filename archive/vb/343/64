AMEN! 

I finally cut a new opening in the rear of my Garage over the weekend so I
could roll the 65 Deluxe Westy? into the garage & out of the back yard.(it
was serving as a cocktail lounge) Moved it about 15 feet. Sweet! It's only
been sitting for about 10-12 years-hope to have it on the road for the
Havasu Campout in Jan.

Pax,

Tom Buese-been collecting parts for this bus for years-why? To put it back
on the road!
