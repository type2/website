To be able to share, socialize, and spend time is most important. 
The weather is very important to some of us west and south west type 
some of us are not as hearty as those with the wet and cooler areas. Yes 
we ( us ) are fair weather campers.
Shade in summer shelters in winter.  But some of the most popular meets 
are hot no shade or cold and wet a very hearty group.
Announce a meet with time to plan and come and they will come. Just do 
not go head to head with another big meet.
