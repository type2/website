Hey all you VW toy collectors

My dad just bought my daughter the Lil Bratz Lil Bus.  check it here at etoys
(and others) http://www.etoys.com/genProduct.html?PID=2737439&ctid=17&ls=toys

The splitty comes with lots of unusual M codes like disco ball, double suicide
cargo doors, and best of all a hot tub sunk in the floor!

A little levity in our brave new world.
