so if he did all this, why the heck did he even go on the show? some of you 
are being rediculous!! some young kid has a bus he loves and it got a 
makeover... went from a beater to something cool that im sure him and all 
his friends will REALLY enjoy. isnt that what its all about?! who cares 
about the bondo, its sill on the road, thats what matters. some of us want 
to drive our buses instead of having them in various states of restoration 
for 15 years never to move more than 20 feet at a time.
