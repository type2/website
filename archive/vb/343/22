I found a great source of SS hose clamps. Go to the auto salvage yard 
and find an '80s BMW. There's 6 or more 8mm to 13mm SS clamps on the 
engine and some larger sizes to fix your heater hoses, garden hoses, 
hookah, etc. The clamps sold at FLAPS and hardware stores have the 
threads cut into the band weakening it, the only metal carrying the 
tension is at the edge of those 15-20 holes.  The BMW clamps have 
stamped in threads and a little lip on the outside that keep the band 
from cutting into the hose. They're Germnan too!  Ask at the gate when 
you go in about their policy on small parts. If you buy big parts, 
they'll let you have small ones like nuts, bolts, clamps, fuses, etc.
