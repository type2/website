Subject: Door parts needed.

Can anyone help.  I am looking for serviceable Door
parts that i can use to finish my 61 double cab.

Drivers door handle.  Flat door style (60 & down)(I
know it is not right)  I think it is 211-837-205 C. 
Don't care about the key.  Minor pitting OK

Passenger door lock guts.  Indent style door. (61/64)
I actually only need the inner door handle unit but if
you have a complete unit that is fine.  

Drivers door lock guts.  complete.  Indent style
(61/64)

Cargo door handle.  Again i do not care about the key.

Thanks for the help.
