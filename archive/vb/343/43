paul, it sounds like you are planning to organize a texas bus 
campout!  for a good mix of primitive/comfort camping, i'd suggest 
(at the risk of ruining my secret hideaway) caprock state park... up 
near the panhandle. similar to jerome, az in many ways; not too far 
from major metros, yet remote, steep hills and magnificent scenery, 
great dirt roads to test your suspension on, near to a HUGE hole in 
the ground - palo duro canyon, the 2nd largest canyon after the 
grand.  when we honeymooned there, we stayed at a relatively 
primitive area, but just down the park road were showers. great 
place. we saw NO ONE most of the time we were there (mid-june). like 
jerome, i would avoid camping there from july - sept!
