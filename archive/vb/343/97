Subject: Bosch 021 distributers timing question?

Ola Splits,

  Well I installed the Bosch 021 distributor yesterday and tried to set
the timing. It seems that the metal pot pie (vacuum advance) won't allow
it to turn around so the notch on the rim is at the 1 cylinder firing
position, so I need to either re-arange the wires (1&3, 2&4) or change the
valve setting 180 degrees apart (probably the wires!) This distributer
seems to be the one for 71 engines and I've heard that the Mexican Engines
are similar to these.  Anyone had any experiance with the Bosch 021
Distributor?

Best,
joe
