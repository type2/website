Subject: [VB] rear axle seal replacement

I just replaced my rear axle seal and the seal kit I got had 2 of the square paper gaskets.  I only used one and for a few days after replacing the seal, I noticed very slight leakage from the real axle seal.  Did I do something wrong/bad by only using one of the paper gaskets?

BTW: I used a floor jack and a breaker bar to loosen the 46mm axle nut... works great
