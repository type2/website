As to the derivation of "No Quarter"...

"By the 1590s an idiom to keep good quarters with had
grown up, meaning to have good relations with a
person, presumably a reference to the need to stay on
good terms with those living with or around
youShakespeare used it in The Comedy of Errors in
1590 in a way that showed he was having fun with an
expression already well known. So to give no quarter
might have meant dont show any friendliness to the
enemy. Its possible also that to give quarters could
refer to the need to provide prisoners with a place to
stay, so that to give no quarter was a figurative way
of saying take no prisoners."
