Subject: Easier ball Joint Replacement?

Anyone have experience with this method of ball joint replacement. I got it 
off the RAMVA list and the poster is one of the experts on the list:

        A properly equipped shop has a hyd tool which can swap out ball
        joints on a Bus without even removing the trailing arms.
        May take some phoning around.
