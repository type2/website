Sean,
Using stock wiring in a 68 DC we get low voltage reading at the front 
when the head lights are on, ok at the rear but the low gauge does get 
ones attention.
We ran a large gauge to run a power outlet as we use lots of  
accessories power.
P & C

I'd rather not run a wire lengthwise but we'll see.
