Subject: H4's and Generator

A friend of mine is converting his '66 Westfalia over to 12V. Wants to
retain generator for stock look, but will it have enough juice to run
everything and H4's? If not other then an alternator, are there options?
Checked the archives but nothing specific....

I also noted the soldered headlight switch mod posted earlier.

Thanks as always for any assistance!!!
