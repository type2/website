Subject: Re: [VB] That plastic sheath on the throttle cable, where does

The amount of fuel line from the tank to the engine seems the right amount 
for use as an accelerator tube... so replace the bus's fuel line and put the old 
stuff on the accelerator cable, and as the gas metal line grommet    :)

Joe,

Your cable is most likely stuck in a long groove that it has been cutting
thru the side of the transmission, left side. Get some fuel line, about
18" worth and slide it over the cable so that it's no longer rubbing
against the tranny. You can undo the cable at the carberator, and pull it
out, slide the line over it and reinstall the cable, or if you cut a
spiral slit along the fuel line piece, you can just snap the split fuel
line over the cable without removing it.

While you are at it, split a two
inch length of fuel line, and slip it over your metal fuel line where it
goes thru the front tin piece (front is front), where the grommet that's
supposed to be there is gone. This will prevent 98% of all engine fires,
as it prevents the metal fuel line from being cut thru by the tin piece.
