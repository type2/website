Hi,

First, I have to add some bus content: My '65 Deluxe has a bench seat 
and two pop-out side windows. Talk amongst yourselves.

In regards to time. I agree. Most people that I know are way-busy. As a 
nation, we cut back on the workforce, but not on the work load. I think 
we are at the all-time high for hours-worked (statistically).

And for all this time, I thought "No Quarter" was in reference to, eh 
hem - and that's why he was in Nebraska, or South Dakota. I kinda felt 
sorry for him not having a quarter - not that I have one, but I have 
dreams of someday not being the corporate guy with a growing family. 
;-)

My engine has been dropped halfway out of my Vanagon for several weeks 
now. (Oops, wrong list.) No time to fix it. So I ride my bike to work. 
(I bought a Schwinn Deluxe.)

OK. Back to my cube.

Conrad
