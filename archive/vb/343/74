Subject: VIN location for '58 single cab

Hello, I recently aquired a '58 european single cab named Zorm.  Some of you
may remember zorm.  Let me know if you have any interesting stories.

Anyway the VIN plate is missing in the engine compartment and I want to find
the stamped vin number but can't locate it.  I went to dropgates.com and the
number isn't where it says.  Does anyone have a '58 single cab and know where
the stamped number is?

This is titled off of the Body number and I would like to find the chassis
number so I can attempt to get a birth certificate.

any help would be appreciated
thanks
