Mostly it depends on which H4s he runs.  The stock 12 V headlight is
rated at 40/50 W, and if it has been replaced by a halogen sealed-beam,
is probably 50/60 W or possibly 40/65 W.  H4s are available in 55/60 W,
80/100 W, and 100/130 W.  The lowest-rated H4s are only 30 W (2.5 A)
more than stock on low beam and 20 W (1.7 A) more than stock on high
beam, which is probably not enough to worry about.

interesting; it's an analysis I did of the loads in a 6 V system.

In looking at the Bentleys, there appear to be a couple of flavors of
12 V generators.  The one that was installed as an M-code when stock
was 6 V seems to be a 450 W (38 A) unit.  The one that became stock
in '67 and '68 seems to be a 360 W (30 A) unit.  Then in '69, a 450
W (38 A) unit was installed again, which stayed in until the Type IV
engine with alternator was installed.

So, it looks like you want to score one of the 12 V M-code generators
(probably rare as hen's teeth) or one of the '69-'71 generators.  A
stock '66 should have the stand and fan housing plate for the 105 mm
diameter generator, which is what I think these 12 V units will be.
There might be some interference with the fuel pump or the carburetor,
but I _think_ that's only a problem with the much fatter alternator.
