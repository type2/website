I'm not really inflluenced by the availability of hot showers. A few years 
back I invested in one of those solar shower bags- basicly just a black 
rubber bladder that heats water through solar inslolation then you hang it 
up above you and open up the valve. Voila! A lukewarm shower leaving you 
with a slight aroma of warm rubber!
