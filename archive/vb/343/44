It made me more then cringe Eric I can't imagine if that the quality they do 
on national TV, then I'm sure its the same for everything else. 
I will continue to say I have never done such crap work on any of the 
restorations I have ever done. But I have seen that type of work done on a bug that 
was recently featured in one of the VW mags. 

my new slogan should be
If anyone in this group is looking for a professional restoration e-mail me 
and I will do far better quality then seen on TV.
