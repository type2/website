Subject: Short heater cable

I am replacing the heater cable for my 64 Single cab. I get the new cable
routed without a problem but the cable ends appear to be to short by a couple
of
inches. I cannot stretch the cabble to the heater box barrel clamp mounts. I
have tried swapping the cable ends into the opposite holes but no help. This
is
the 2nd cable I have tried as I ruined the first one. The cable was purchased
from WW for a non walk-thru bus. Can anybody tell me what I am doing wrong,

I inherited the same problem on my '61 panel so I attached some safety wire
just forward of the cable end and the other end to the heater box lever. It's
not the pure fix, but I have heat.
