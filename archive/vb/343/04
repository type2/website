Some one else will finish this, but the new ones need modification to 
fit (bending the frame? ) maybe you can find information in the old 
messages.
All we know have used rebuilt as that is what is available.  Who has the 
new ones and how much the rebuilt are about $225. We are going to 
install a good used one.
