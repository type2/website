Interesting.  Must be a bootleg; Bentley doesn't offer the '50-'62 or
'63-'67 manuals on CD.  IMHO ~$100 is cheap for the nice reprints that
Bentley offers -- I've got the '50-'62, '62-'67, and '68-'79 Bentleys,
even though I only have a '64.  Try getting a reprint of equivalent
quality for a random 54-year-old American or Japanese car...
