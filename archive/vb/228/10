 The key to projects of this sort is KISS, keep it simple.  Get all the

 Temperature, humidity, road surface, winds, etc. could all affect cooling,

ya, you should have seen what we got into last quarter, trying to figure the 
ffciency of making electricity from sounds waves via crystals 
(piezoelectricity).   That apparatus went through some tricky evolution!  

Anyway, maybe this engine compartment pressurisation thing will work.  Funny 
how there are lotsa ideas about how it works.  Seems a lot easier than 
pulling fan shrouds and changing oil coolers (upright (dif kinds?), upright 
porsche, doghouse, type 3 doghouse, type 4 doghouse) to see how that affects 
cooling.

Might do
 removing engine seals (ie engine compartment door, etc) 

do they make scoops that you can put on your bus w/o drilling holes?   If so 
I'd pop some on and drive around a bit.

Funny thing is this westy runs so cool right now. Takes a while to get it up 
to 80 C oil temps.  I've been thinking of going back to a regular gen pulley 
(right now it has a 6V small pulley) but as that involves changing the front 
gen tin I've not bothered.  It kicks out so much heat!  bits of paper on the 
front floor get kicked up into the air.

now, how do I tie this into physics academically?
