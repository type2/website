Subject: Re: survey: testing cooling etc [VB] was side scoops

well, it seems to be a go. 
I can get college credit for testing engine compartment pressurisation under different circumsatnces (tin, seals, scoops, lack thereof) and how that correlates to engine temps. Sure that's physics.

evidently the college has equipment I can use that uses batteries (rather than plugs into a wall), and Peter the SIT  (lab guy) of course had a 69 VW, and is super helpful.

Seems like my bus will shortly have loads of sensors everywhere :)
