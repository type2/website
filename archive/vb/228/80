Wow! That's pretty much what I invented back in 95! I used four 'hooks'
per scoop welded to machine screws that came out to where the scoop would
fasten to them, holding it against the body, with a layer of soft
closed-cell neoprene as a sealer/protector. Wierd thing is that I never
used them, and gave them away to a listee several years ago, out in San
Fran. Had the scoops custom made, and painted during the restoration.
