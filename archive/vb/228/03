Back in the eighties there used to be a rear roof lip scoop that ducted down a
molded fiberglass inside flat duct squeezed between the door hinges and the
corner and vented into the engine compartment. I heard that the company
hocking the kit quit selling it because there was too many issues of not
sealing good enough for the rain and such causing leaks inside the bus. Anyone
have a pic of that set up?

Yes, if the engine compartment seals are perfect, what we would look for
is a possible increase of engine compartment air pressure, with or
without, say scoops.  Do scoops help?  What's going on in there?  If we
could increase the perfect engine compartment's air pressure this would
help cooling and carburation, if the air was cool and fresh!  Gary Gibson
