Subject: shiftrod rusted to tube

I tried again today to free the shiftrod that's rusted to the 
shiftrod tube of my old '59 Single Cab. The rod broke off about an 
inch of the way inside the front of the tube. The rest of the rod is 
there all the way out to the back of the shiftrod tube. So it sticks 
out a little there.

I've tried penetrating oil and phosphoric acid...also tried many 
different ways of banging on the rod...no dice.

So I'm down to a suggestion to block up one side of the tube and pour 
something in there to break it loose. The suggetions I got were some 
type of pipe cleaner.

What would be the most effective chemical to break this thing loose?

It's such an akward thing to get to on either end. Makes trying to 
break it free a major pain in the rear.

I'm about to so O.F.* and just move to plan B...which would be to cut 
the heater tube out then cut out and replace the shiftrod tube 
completely. Reason why I say is that even if I get this rod out it's 
probably gonna be a big mess in that tube anyway.

So, anyone every replaced a shiftrod tube in a bus?
