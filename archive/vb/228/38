Hallo again VW friends,

Today I am very happy to announce they found our stolen 40 foot
container
back, the thieves only did unload partial and trowed most stuff back in,
the
container was abonded on the trailer behind a stolen truck near Turnhout
a
City about 35kms from BBT Head quarters...

The Police cooperated very well and we where able to unload the
container
this afternoon at our premises, our first opinion we think that between
1
and 3 pallets are missing...I will give detail of missing goods by next
friday when everything is really unpacked and counted.... We are very
happy
only limited parts are missing, this thing could have led to disaster
for
the BBT company and all his workers... all employees will find there
sleep
again this weekend!

We wanted especially thank all the People that spreaded the news over
the
internet, I saw very active messageboards all over Europe and had
incredible
respons for people on the look out all over the world even from Japan,
New
zeeland and Australia, for me its an honour to work in such a good and
fair
community! If we all cooperate we can keep our hobby clean! Together
where
strong!

Thanks guys...

After a week full of stress and sleepless nights I am again proud to say
again.....

....keep the VW faith!
