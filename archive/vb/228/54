Possibly true, but I was mainly trying to describe one possible and
relatively simple measurement that can be made.

The trend in houses has been to make them very air tight to save energy
on heating and cooling.  However, houses that are extremely air tight
have disadvantages such as being able to smell farts for a week.  Some
new houses have a "heat recovery ventilator", basically a hole to the
outside with an air/air heat exchanger, to get some fresh air into the
house.

My theory was that in an engine bay with stock tin, good seals, etc,
if you forced air in with an external blower, the only place it should
go is through the fan shroud, over the cylinders, and out the bottom.
This would give you some baseline pressure number.  Then you could make
changes - deleting tin, removing the seal or substituing an old crappy
one, etc - and see how much the pressure drops.  The pressure drop is
a measure of how much air isn't going through the fan shroud.

This might work better in a Bug than a Bus.  I haven't looked lately
but I'm not sure if space between the inner and outer skin of the Bus
is blocked off forward of the air louvers.  If it isn't, blowing air
into the louvers would blow air forwards toward the load space instead
of only into the engine bay.

Interesting.  Bentley says that the 1500 for that year needed 550 L / sec
of cooling air at 3800 rpm.  I make that 19.4 ft^3/sec but they claimed
19.6 ft^3/sec.  Plus, the combustion air could all come through those
holes as well.  (Warm air will actually come from "under" the engine,
but assuming it all comes through the vents gives a worst-case scenario.)
Since you have to fill each cylinder once every 2 revolutions, that's
(1.493 L/4 cyls) * ((3800 rev/1 min) / 2) * (1 min / 60 sec) * 4 cyls or
127 L / sec (4.47 ft^3/sec) for the combustion air.  So, you've got a total
of about 23.9 ft^3/sec going through the vents.  23.9 ft^3/sec /
(105 in^2 * (1 ft^2 / 144 in^2)) = 32.8 ft/sec air velocity at the vents.
This corresponds to 22.3 miles per hour.  (If I guesstimate the air cleaner
snorkel opening at 2"x3", the velocity of the combustion air at the snorkel
is around 73 mph!)  If you assume that half the air comes through each
side, and that scoops result in the air going through the louvers nearly
as fast as the road speed, this says that scoops might be doing some good
at speeds over 11 mph.

On the other hand, the scoops add drag.  Given that the frontal area
of a Bus is around 3 m^2 (empirical formula from Bosch of 0.9 * track
* height gives 3.27 m^2; using Bentley specs and multiplying width *
(height - ground clearance) gives 2.98 m^2), and that the scoops are
0.30 m high and stick out 0.05 m, two scoops will add 0.03 m^2 to the
area of the Bus.  This is only about a 1% increase, but may be enough
to notice.

I know we weren't talking about scoops, but I figured I'd throw it in
to the discussion.
