 have had problems with my wiper switch so I suppose it is there. Has anyone

I would check the ground on the gas guage.   Ie, loosen the knurls, and 
scritch the bracket a little against the underside of the dash and tighten it 
back down.   I guess it was grounding back throughthe light on the guage.  
Though how this connects to the wipers is beyond me.  

Glad you had fun at the campout.  We need more campouts.  :)
