I believe the holes were on later trucks. Go to www.dropgates.com for details. 
Was it bay trucks only? I guess you could do battle with the dept. of motor 
vehicles and get a third license plate to mount on the inside of the gate. 




To anticipate your next question... No, that's not an ashtray on the passenger 
side of the rear gate, it's a step when the gate is down. ;-)
