Subject: last-minute performance mods?

dug up a few things the other day, wondered if they should go in the 
aluminum case:

race-trim windage tray

215mm f&s pressure plate - i gather many in the late 70s considered 
it da bomb to mount this 911/914 pplate to a bus or high-po bug.
am i right in assuming that i would need to machine the f/w to do this?
