Subject: Aluminum block update

Well,
just got the news on block #4141. Turns out that it did need the main bore
trued up and 2 thousandths were align bored out. Also #3 main bearing rib was
slightly big and had to be narrowed down for the bearing. I ran a dry rotary
brush inside the block halves in all corners and crevices and came up with
additional loose sand sticking to the walls and casting flash. The distributor
drive shaft slid in fine but the bottom where the shim washers but up against
was not machined large enough in diameter for the washers to lay flat, that
will get touched up later. I purposely bought a welded aftermarket 20/10 CW
crank and once all the bearings fit in the case we will see about clearance.
My cam hasn't come in yet and I am anxious to see how the cam gear lines up.
The lifter holes seem OK, can't tell yet without everything in there. More
pics soon.
