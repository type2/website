Subject: Looking For One Item...

Hey everyone,

With BYOB and Kelley Park on the horizon, the list of parts needed for my 
67 camper is getting prioritized.  And there is consistently one item that 
I definitely need to pick up ASAP.

A passenger side, black vent wing latch.

Does anyone out there have one they're willing to part with?  You don't 
have to be headed to BYOB next weekend, but it'd be nice to be able to pick 
it up there.  It doesn't even need to be NOS or gorgeous...it can be a 
little pitted, a little scratched.  It just needs to work.  Please p-mail 
me if you have one and let me know whatcha want for it.

Thanks,
-Taylor
