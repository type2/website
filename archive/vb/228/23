FYI while DP50 is great stuff it is an epoxy primer...not a self etching
primer.  Two different animals. :-)  Both have their uses though and are
somewhat interchangeable. DP(XX) takes longer to dry but is better in
the elements, while the etching dries really fast and can be worked
sooner.  Both have great anti corrosion characteristics when top coated
properly.  DP can be used as a tintable sealer too.
