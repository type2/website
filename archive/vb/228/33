Hi Rex,
We would jack up and installs stands under the rear torsion tubes as high as 
possible.  Then seal the front of the tube with plasitc and duct tape and a 
bucket underneath for any leaks.  Then fill the tube as full as possible with 
phosperic acid.  If the other end leaks keep filling the tube twice a day at 
least, yes you can reuse the drippings from the front.
  Try also pounding the tube with a rubber malet to see if that will 
loosenthe rust inside up.
We have used phosperic acid to loosen the tiniest screws by soaking or 
repeated often application, letting the acid just sit and dry results in the 
acid in crystalizing clogging things up again.
