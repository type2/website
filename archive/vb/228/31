Hi Volks,
Part of the problem with the Puyallup show is that is indoors because of very 
iffy late spring wet weather at the fairgrounds and thus the Puyallup city 
rules do get in the way sometimes.  NW shows start later and end later than 
those in the South is probably due to the much cooler weather up here!  We 
have seen Californians up here at the Vintage meet in tank tops and shorts 
shivering and turning blue in the late July morning weather.  Heck we 
probably could make a killing selling used flannel shirts there!
