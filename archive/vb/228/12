The key to projects of this sort is KISS, keep it simple.

By George I think you're onto something, VW probably did a pretty good
job on the enginev cooling.
I seem to be the only one in my neighborhood driving around a 37 year old
vehicle.
Might that be because I'm the only one that is broke? Well not broke but
badly bent.
