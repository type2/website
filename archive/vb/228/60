ya, that's what I'm thinking.  At a stop the engine compartment is 
vacuumised, and the scoops have little or no effect.

Air can be compressed easily, so when the campartment is pressurised, the air 
blown by the fan is denser than the usual 1.2 kg/sq m or whatver it usually 
is.   I'm thinking a sensor to measure pressure or speedo of air coming out 
of the heat boxes might be useful.

I'd expect pressure in teh engine compartment be regulated by speed, with or 
without vents
