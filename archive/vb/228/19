I'm not sure if this is what you're asking, but I semi-recently replaced
the front bush (right under the gear shift) only on my '64.  At first I
tried it with the shift rod in place, trying to squeeze the bushing in
between the rod and the bracket so the groove in the center would go into
the bracket.  That didn't work; I couldn't even squeeze it enough to get
the first groove (for the retaining clip) through the bracket.  I pulled
the front rod out, put the bush in the bracket, and slid the rod back in -
no problem.
