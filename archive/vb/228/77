Subject: Re: [VB] survey: testing cooling etc [VB] was side scoops

I was discussing this very subject at Everybus this weekend with a few folks. 
 John Stainkamp has just 2 words - "Scoops bad".  I know John and his 
abilities well enough to say OK.

I was also talking with another John (I think that's your name I'm pretty 
tired), who happens to have a Mechanical Engineering degree.  I saw that 
y'all were talking about actual data gathering finally!.  John and I came up 
with the same idea, a manometer.  However, instead of a piece of tubing with 
one end in a jar, we reasoned a 'U' would show a differential better than one 
end in a jar.  The U could be mounted to el-cheepo cardboard with lines 
spaced an inch apart for measurement purposes.  the other end of the tube 
could be run out a popout, th through the louvers, and to anywhere in the 
engine room you want data from.  We thought the center of the engine room, in 
front of the fan, and (just for fun) in front of the intake for the air 
cleaner.  Could build 3 of these cheaply and do all 3 datapoints at the same 
time!!.  A run up and down the road without the scoops, and a run up and down 
with, pausing at various speeds to get the readings should settle this (for a 
while anyhow).  Might be best to have 2 people, 1 driving and 1 logging data.

The open end of the manometer will give you a pressure differential between 
the open end and the engine room end.  If vertical won;t show a difference 
then flatten the 'U' out some to make small increments more pronounced.

Everybus trip report to follow.
