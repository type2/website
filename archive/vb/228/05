Survey ?
I've got a scoop on one side of my 66 Westy that blast enough air through
an oil cooler mounted there to wet the motor dowd in a heavy rain storm.
I even bought two new scoops from Empi so I could match the one that is
there for the other side.
My engine is an unknown cc that is 71 and up by the engine number prefix
and it cools very good.
It normally takes 45 minutes on the highway to get the temp up around 200
(F) which is actually too cool for it. It seldom reaches 212 (f) in the
worst heat and fighting head winds.
