Back in 92 I had been plagued with wiring problems on my 71 westy, my favorite
camper at the time, and it really burned me not finding it. After a month a
friend of mine got up under the dash while the wipers were going and found the
wiper arm hitting against the dash wire bundle. At first look there wasn't any
real problem, but after hitting it with light at different angles we found a
wire with insulation scraped off and the wiper arm hitting that area grounding
out that circuit. I repaired the wire and a number of others and tied the
bundle up out of the way. I learned long ago that somewhere in small print
there is a license from VW to modify the wiring harness in any fashion the
owner wants. I've only owned 9 dubs of differing types since 69, but everyone
of them had thrashed wire harnesses. Most I could live with but some had to
have extensive repair.

A funny thing happened on the way back from Everybus. When the carabus hit
Boone NC, we hit some rain. When I started the wipers, the gas gauge started
"wiping" as well. Teddy thought it was funny, "We need gas, no we don't, we
need gas, no we don't, ..etc. It actually moved in unison with the wipers. I
have had problems with my wiper switch so I suppose it is there. Has anyone
seen this before?

EveryBus was great! Thanks Chris!
I carabused with the TN Mechanized division on the Full Moon Bus Club. We
arrived Thursday just after noon, and spent the weekend relaxing and
socializing. It was very nice. We won the coveted best campsite award thanks
to our competition from Canada voting for us!

My engine is running cooler since the addition of the stock vacuum only
dizzy (thanks mad uncle dave), but have no power on hills. I spent a long
stretch in second gear coming up the mountain, and got temps a little over
250, but that was the only time I was nervous. I need to check the timing
again.
