Splitnosers;

  All this talk of cooling has got me thinking...For a plane to pressurize
a cabin; pressure in the plane is bled off the engine and pumped through
the cabin, when the pressure becomes too much a flapper valve opens in the
cabin and release the excess pressure so your ears do not pop.

  For the transporter assume the excess pressure in the engine compartment
(because it is well sealed) is pushed in the fan and via vanes in the fan
shroud to tin surrounding the heads.  The higher the pressure the more
cubic feet of air is pushed through.   If the scoops are on, the pressure
into the engine compartment is regulated by speed, with the effect of a
ramjet.  If you stop, the scoops effect would for pressurization would be
negligible.  Perhaps it will compromise the amount of air due to the
smaller intake and less cubic feet of cooling are available?

   For the sake of reliable results, the temperature and altitude,
barometric pressure and wind should be the same.  Here is one suggestion
for the experiment.  All reading (pressure, head temperature, oil
temperature) should be taken with the same controls as possible (i.e. 55
mph for 10 min., then stop and go for 5 min.)  A magnetic sheet could
cover the louvered intakes and a reading taken.  Then a reading could be
taken without the louvers covered, and then a reading with the scoops on.
I hope this would give some sort of results that are epistemological.

Quixotically Yours,
joe
