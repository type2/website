I thought that the 67 12 volt wiper issue was solved with getting a 66 6 volt
wiper motor and buying the 12 volt conversion kit?

I am just finishing of the restoration of a 1967 Sliding door Samba from a
bare shell. I was thinking of all the hassles of having a 67 year model,
finding a 12volt wiper motor, etc. And with it having a sliding door finding
a popout window latch, etc., etc. So what is everybody's favourite year and
least favourite year and why? Mike
