Mike,

I would leave the bus home whenever the salted roads are wet - period. ANY
salt solution that gets anywhere on or in your bus begins to corrode it
immediately, and tends to keep going. Case in point:

I restorated my bus in 95, in LA. The bus has driven thru California
winters, totally rain-soaked for 8 years, with not a sign of rust on
anything under the bus. I drove to Long Island NY in January, passing thru
the NE corridor on a dry day between storms, avoiding all puddles except
some onramps and such that were wet. I got here, and sprayed the whole bus
down with hot water the next morning, including the underside, gave it a
thorough sponge wash and rinse, including the wheelwells, then dried
everything, and garaged it.

I went under it to check it out during my torsion bar repair, and every
exposed nut, bolt, and unPOR-ed piece of metal has a bright red patch of
rust on it. 12 hours of salt exposure in the driveway, a hot water wash,
and there's rust that I'm gonna have to sand off and pickle with
phosphate. Needless to say, I will never drive it in the wet while here.

I suggest you do not expose your bus ever to salt.
