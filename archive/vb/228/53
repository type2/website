Subject: FS 83 Air Cooled Westfalia Camper Motivated Seller

Fellas I'm motivated to sell my 83 Air Cooled Westy.
I'm asking $8000.00 and I'll give a 12,000 mile warranty on the 20K
engine.
This is zero rust Texas Westy, I'm the second owner for (8 years).
My motivation is because I need money to handle my startup in the
Ceramics Coatings business.
This Westy has not been just maintained, every moving part requiring
lubrication has been replaced.
It had been restored to drive, handle and run like new. Way too much to
list here.
If you ever wanted a Westy to just get in and travel the country this is
the one that will make the trips dependably and get you back home.
If I find some interest here I'll give details on warranty and put the
pictures and details up on the Web Site tonight. 
This is zero rust Texas Westy, I'm the second owner for (8 years).
NO, it doesn't have A/C.
