I get irritated at some swappers who put out a bunch of stuff and when you ask about it you get, " That? Oh, thats a '67 NOS ambulance fan that i found at a local dealership and blah, blah, blah. It's for display only i'm never going to  be selling it."  My feeling is that if your not selling it leave it at home or at least in your car if you are swapping. I walk the swap looking for parts, not to hear braggards tell me how cool they are. But then again I might be easily irritated!?

Oh yeah!  NICE.  Could not have said it better.   The swap is for
swapping and selling...not showing off, not even if you're doing it out
of the true spirit of "educating" folks.
