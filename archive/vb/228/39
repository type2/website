I am in the UK, where most buses have had major surgery to the lower 6
inches if they have been on the road for the last 30 odd years.  In the last
few weeks I have seen a few buses with their shift rods out, well 3
anyway...  Each had the front shift rod rubber in various states.  Mine had
the best rubber, and my rod had surface rust for the first 6 inches, another
had a little bit worse, perhaps about 12 inches of rust, however one did not
have much left of its rubber, and it had rust for 3/4 of its length.
However this rust was far worse at the front.

I also noticed that the front shift rod bush (the one that is in the tube)
was the most worn out of the two in the tube.  So might bet is that the rod
is stuck somewhere at the front.  However if the bus has been sitting for
years with a broken front gearbox mount, all bets are off!  This would cause
the rod to be pushed down at the rear and rust together there.

Might be worth getting an air chisel and hammering at it from each end - I
would probably push forward from the rear.
