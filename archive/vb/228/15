do they make scoops that you can put on your bus w/o drilling holes?   If
so 
I'd pop some on and drive around a bit.

Duct tape.
That will work OK to attach the scoops for testing and if they blow off
you'll know for sure that they catch a lit of air.
I have a scoop that doesn't require any holes to be drilled.
It has two flat metal hooks that hook into the vent slots, two screws go
through the vent and hold it tight against the side of the van. Just some
simple southern engineering and some weather strip and you got vents that
leave no trail if you remove them.
Pictures if you want.
