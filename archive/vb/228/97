Subject: Air conditioning

Hi everyone. New to the list. Hope I can contribute as well as I've seen
others do.

Questions: Has anyone have any info on putting a modern air conditioning
unit in a 1967 or similar deluxe? Does anyone have any feedback or
experience with Jerry West's units?

I'm installing a type 4 engine in my '67 deluxe with IRS conversion, bigger
gas tank, gas heater, etc. Figured I'd try to shoehorn an air conditioning
unit in as well for those times when when cracking the safaris just won't
cut it.

I greatly appreciate any feedback!
