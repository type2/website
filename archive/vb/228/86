Good improvement with the U design.
I suggest reading the pressure/vacuum (the U does either well), at specific 
rpms in 2nd, 3rd and 4th gears. The different road speeds at these gears 
should be recorded for reference. A difference in vacuum/pressue same rpm but 
different gears and speeds could be meaningful.
