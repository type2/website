I had the most amazing piece of luck when it happened to me.  I was turning into my driveway and pushed in the clutch to coast to a stop -- and 
that's when it tore thru.

BTW, the tranny and rgb's are back in place and I'm finishing up some final touches this weekend - hope to have the engine in and everything 
organized by Monday!
