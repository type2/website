Creative is still in the process of improving their latches which have had a
history of failure. I put off buying their safaris with the hope that they
would have completed their latch improvements. To this date they have not
begun to market the new & improved latches (which I am told will be
stainless) but extended me the courtesy of replacements once they became
available, should the old ones fail.
