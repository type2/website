one thing to keep in mind - the VW is a >compromise< between many 
demands... cruise 60kph for 8 hours, not have a radiator to boil or 
freeze, carry 4 fully-loaded wehrmacht members -er, deutsche 
pikinikers...   :)
i'm willing to bet that the front tin also PREVENTS too MUCH air from 
getting in in colder climes, causing reduced temps/efficiency.
as you up ccs and carb size, yes, the AF/H is gonna  have to go up. 
but unless you live in AZ, i would leave the tin on and think of some 
other way to increase air to the fan.
'course, you could simply do  a seasonal pull - spring, metalmesh tin 
goes in; fall, the standard tin.
