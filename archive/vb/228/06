I agree with Eric, my engine compartment sucks too. The roof is so low that I
banged my head trying to get the battery out the other day!

The upper engine compartment would be under vacuum, due to the fan sucking
in all that wonderful cool air. The more vents, or, ways for air to get into
the engine bay, the less vacuum you would have, the less vents, or, less
ways for air to get into the engine bay, the more vacuum you will have.
