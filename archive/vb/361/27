Hi All,

Who is headed out to O.C.T.O and the Classic in Irvine next weekend?
I plan to attend both and maybe the Gene Berg rally.

Tomorrow I will head over to Rick and Ronnies in Torrance for the DubClub
meeting.

Now down to the important stuff. Where is the best place to hang a cup
holder in the cab? My guess is that under the wing window works pretty well.
What is best? A solid holder or one of those fancy swinging gimballed units?
Let me know where you put your's.

Chris
