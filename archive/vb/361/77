Why not just glue a little neodymium magnet to the pulley and run it past
a coil hooked to the input of the O-scope?  Put the magnet on the rim of
the pulley and you'll get nice sharp spikes that are easy to measure.  The
coil needn't be mounted, just held near the path of the magnet.  You could
get a suitable coil by disassembling an audio transformer or somesuch.
All you need is a small coil of 100 turns or so.

Two magnets, two coils, and a dual-trace oscilloscope will yield a direct
measurement of actual RPM ratio.  Compare this to the ratio when you are
simply turning the crank by hand and you'll have a good idea of the
slippage.
