Subject: Ride in a bus.

Hi,

I live in Torrance, CA. I would love to get a ride in someone elses bus to
compare the noise levels. I would like to ride in one with a quiet pak
exhaust as well as one with a standard VW exhaust. My bus is just so loud
inside, I would like to get a reality check on whether this is normal or
not.

Anyone?

Thanks,
Chris
