day 2 was yesterday
 
day 1 on field bus with 79 tags.   we wanted to see if the tranny was good... so the aim was to see if motor worked, and drove around.
pulled plugs, squirted oil down each , put in new plugs, except on old one came out with a insert on it...hm..
(meanwhile, the seats and interior panels were pulled out)
 found out the bus was 12V, so stole a 12V battery out of a running bus, and ran gas line to a can.   Put a ignition switch with a key in the bus.  replaced cap and rotor.  turned the key and the engine fired right up!!!!  a huge cloud of black smoke poured out of the header flange where no muffler was, and the engine soiunded real sweet!!!!    
 
shut it down and drained the oil.  black.   lots of slkudge on oil circle plate.    replaced plate/plug.
added 2 qts oil.   started again and let run for about ten minutes.  Drained black oil out of engine.
 
 
put plug back in.   added 2 qts oil. start bus   back bus out of garage.  ***moves under its own power***  bus has reverse, and first gears.
 
drive kombi ... all gears good...to car wash, get $10 in quarters, pulled the front seats, and pressure washed the inside, the outside, the engine area, the underside.   left lots of dirt there, and giot completely saked and dirty with stuff knocked off the kombi.
 
drove back to the shop (has ebrake)  :)   good first day for a bus sitting about 25 years!!!
