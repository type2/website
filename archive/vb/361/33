That's kind of me - I try it for the adventure of exploration and see
if I can learn something. I'm building a camper and decided to use an
engine I was told was nearly new but doesn't have ideal compression. I
was told by an aircraft mechanic that the compression should come up
once it runs a little. We'll see!
