Lou,

Thanks for the warning. I have a furnace brazed and ballanced fan from Sc$t.
I think it will withstand the speed.  I will report on the slippage when I
collect some information.

 Just a reminder, do not over tighten the belt if you're using an
 aftermarket (including the Porsche) pulley(s) on top and an aluminum
bottom.
 They can explode!  I set my belt tension very loose, with no ill effects
 from slippage.
