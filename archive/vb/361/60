Subject: Re: Porsche pulley

George here's what info i gave Ted on June 1st: (the measurement was for a
brand new belt before installation and any stretching, by the way)

  Ted here's the "ContiTech" number AVX10X888.  I measured the length on the
'outside diameter' and it's app. 30 1/8".  Now this belt fits correctly if
you
have the 7" diameter stock 'D' crank pulley and the Porsche or 36hp upper
pulley.  I don't exactly know which VWs came with the 'D' pulley.  Most
pulleys i have are 6 3/4" so measure yours.
