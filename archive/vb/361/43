What  does the grooved valve change ? Who sells it ?


Hi Arnaud,
Well if you look at the Workshop Manual fro 1963-67, section M-8, page  2.  
With the groove the relief piston ends up between positions "A" &  "B", 
allowing overpressure of the oil higher RPMs to be relieved but still  100% going 
through oil cooler.
 
Also see section M-8, page 4, for the "Note" on this grooved piston and  part 
number.
 
Most any VW shop should be able to supply you with one.  You might  try:
