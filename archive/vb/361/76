We are not doing post cards this time but we are keeping a blog.  For 
those of you new to 'blogs' they are web logs where we can post pictures 
and text about our travels.  These get backed up so to look at previous 
blogs click on the archives list on the bottom left.

We are currently in Almonte, Ontario, Canada and plan to head east from 
here, visiting new bus friends and heading back toward Maine.
