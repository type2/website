Subject: Re: Bus front end. Here we go again.

Thanks for the MANY replys to this topic (most off list). I am gonna try 
to start into the diagnostics this week. To answer a few easy questions 
first:
Yes light truck tires.
Yes I have been under there with Teddy rocking the wheel back and forth. 
No slop noted.
Did again with wifey doing the wheel (poor choice- " my arm is tired" 
after about 60 seconds). :-(
Tires inflated properly.

I want to do one thing at a time so this might take a while. I'll be 
back to tell you what I find.

1st step readjust the steering box and check toe in.
