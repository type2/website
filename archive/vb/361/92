Subject: Re: [VB] Belt slippage.

On my part, it is not so much an issue of worries as I find it an
interesting engineering challenge to discover what might really be going on.
The pulley is a smaller diameter, therefore smaller belt/pulley surface area
and less grip, so the slip point may be at lower rpm's than we think.
Especially with the 34mm fan and the additional loading it creates.
