Black Beauty is coal slag, does a good job on chassis rust.
Or you could also use, well, um....sand! (blasting, not play sand).
Plan on 500 lbs. with an 1/8" nozzle, and any reclaim is free.
Roughly $50 retail for sand, a little more for Black Beauty.
If you use a big tarp and window-screen your reclaim, you can use
it again as often as you like. It just gets finer.
