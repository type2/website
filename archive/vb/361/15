Hi TBear,
Try searching for "Porsche Pulley" in the archives.  There are several  
manufactures of belts and several belts from each manufacture that will work for  
different fan ratios.  Also how to shim the Porsche pulley to keep it  aligned 
with the lower pulley.  We would like to hear more  manufacture, belt size, 
and ratio results, from you volks out  there!!!  
  We settled on the lower 2.4:1 ratio, and doing fine!
