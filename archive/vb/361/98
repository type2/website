Hi,

I am also trying to seal up the front doors to reduce the wind noise. I have
some success here. I need a little more attention to the details of the door
seals. I also went into the roof vent and I am trying to get the flap to
seal up. Again, some success and need a little more attention to the
details.

If I drive down San Diego way, I will let you know. I am hoping to hit
FamilienFest in August.

Chris

I'm in San Diego and for other reasons (engine heat) I'd like to share
a similar experience. I'm not planning any to trip to Torrance any
time soon, but will keep Torrance in mind.

I got the bus with a Monza muffler and changed to stock. It is way
less noisy at idle, but at speed other noises take over anyway. On
long trips i use ear plugs.
