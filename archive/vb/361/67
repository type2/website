Pretty tough.  The only way I can think of is to use a digital strobe
light to determine the RPM of the two pulleys while the engine is held at
constant RPM.  Digital strobe lights aren't exactly household items, and
the cheapest run $200+.  Perhaps if you find a friendly physics teacher to
help you out!

Now, in the unlikely event that the pulley ratio is close to 2:1, you
could use a conventional timing light against a mark on the generator
pulley to see if the mark apparently advances or retreats.
