 Just a reminder, do not over tighten the belt if you're using an 
aftermarket (including the Porsche) pulley(s) on top and an aluminum bottom. 
They can explode!  I set my belt tension very loose, with no ill effects 
from slippage.

 As I understand it, belt slippage is to be expected on standard pulleys. To 
prevent it, street Vees use serpentine belts, notched or
 unnotched. This provides added cooling at higher RPM's.

 I was trying to come up with a way to test for belt slippage short of 
taking
 a direct rpm reading of both the crank pulley and the alternator pulley as
 rpm is increased, and then taking the data and checking the speed ratio of
 the two.
