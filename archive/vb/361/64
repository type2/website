I want  to go faster and run a little cooler... Will my 1500 have trouble 
pushing the  3.88? Any experiences...



Hi Eric,
We will Pmail you our "Modified Tranny History".  As for  "will 1500 have 
trouble pushing", it depends on your personal need for  speed, HP, torque, and 
hill climbing ability.  We would suggest a  1641cc (or bigger) fully balanced.
