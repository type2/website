Hi guys,

What a dope, I have an oscilloscope. I just need a way to trigger the scope
off the crank pulley and off the generator pulley. I should be able to do
that with either an optical or a hall effect switch. A little finagling and
I should be able to set up something that will work.  Just need to set an
rpm and read the output frequency off both pulleys. I should be able to see
both within a few percent at a low non slipping speed and also at a fast and
maybe slipping speed. Just calculate the speed ratio's. If both are the same
or close to it, no slippage.

Chris
