Subject: Bus needs help in Rancho Cucomanga Ca

 I'm relaying this request for help from a family that just attended
OCTO/Classic!  They are in need of a rear shift coupler for a '65 T2.  They
are off the "19" at Foothill Rd & Sacred Heart.  They are in route to I-40
then on to Barstow then to Needles.  They are from NM.  Is there anyone that
can help?

 There cell phone is 650-464-2046.  If you have any suggestions on a quick fix
please call them!

Thank you,
 Lou in Havasu
