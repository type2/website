Subject: 66 Bus and SO-35 camping interior for sale

Hello fellow listers,

I thought I would post my for sale items here to 'get the word on the
street' a little more.
I have for sale a 66 Panel bus that has a SO-35 Westfalia camping
interior in it.  I have them for sale on the Samba here with lots of
pictures:

The main items missing are table, rear food-prep cabinet and cushions.
I thought I would sell the bus ($600 obo) and the interior ($1200 obo)
separately, but can sell them together too ($1500 obo).

Bus is located in Vancouver, BC (3 hours north of Seattle).
Give me an email or a phone call if you're interested in anything!
