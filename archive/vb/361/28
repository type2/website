Hi Craig,

There's a big difference between having a shop do your work and doing
your own. If I had your engine, I first would check compression before
tearing down. If compression was adequate, I would not worry about
what the p&c's look like. To me they look like they are just starting
to break in, but it is difficult to judge from a photo. Since you have
it in a shop, I presume you pay to have your VW worked on, so at this
point there is no point in not spending the extra $85 to replace the
p&c's so as to be safe rather than sorry. If it was mine, I'd chance
it, but I'd be the one doing the work, not paying someone else if it
turned out they were bad.

 the shop that tore down the crapcase said i likely had excess case
 pressure (in part because the draft tube was hardened and stiff, and
 not letting it release)... just curious how bad ya'll think the rings
 are, and if they look like the cuprits.
