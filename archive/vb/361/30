I want  to make sure that my oil pressure relief valves (dual presure AE

how do I do it?
how can I  know what spring lengths (and valves) are correct for an unknown 
engine 1600DP  AE case?
I assume that the solid part faces upward on the  valve?



Hi iamdonquixote,
Get yourself the "Official Service Manual" for 1968-79, printed by  Bentley.  
Section 5, pages 26, 27, & 28.  If you are operating in  a climate that stays 
above 70 F you might try the grooved rear relief valve  for increased cooling.
