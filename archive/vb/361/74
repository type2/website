 Matt,

 Very creative. I could also put a diode in series with the neon lamp and
get
 60/second instead of 120. I would want to run the test around 3600 RPM or
 higher anyway, Maybe as high as 4500-5000. I will play with this next
 weekend and will report back.

 The bicycle computer is probably not fast enough for the application.

 Chris
