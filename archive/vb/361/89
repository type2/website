Subject: Re: [VB] Rotary fuel pump filter?

Hi Dave,

I used a similar metal cased filter. I just looked for one of similar 
physical size and correct hose size. It works fine. I wouldn't stress 
about finding exactly the same one.

Anyone using one of those rotary electric fuel pumps (like CBPerformance and
others sale)?  Was wondering if you've you replaced the canister filter that
is located before the pump. If so do you've had any luck getting one from a
FLAPs.  I've got to drain the tank and replace lines and filter, don't want to
use one of the plastic ones pre.  Can't see any marking on it from looking
under the Bus.
