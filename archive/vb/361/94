At this point, my bus interior is fully lined with dynamat extreme and JCW
Heatshield insulation. That is: doors, roof, walls, and floor. I don't think
that the passenger buses had even close to that.  I have not yet installed
the plywood camper interior. Noise is bad enough that ear plugs are a must
have  on the highway.
