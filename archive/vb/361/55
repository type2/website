Hi Ted,
Cool (pun intended) to hear how the Porsche pulley has worked for  you.  
Could you give us some more details about your engine?
  Are you are running a dog house cooling system and how wide of  cooling 
fan?  
 What brand and number of belt used?
 What diameter lower crank pulley?
  What ratio are you getting generator to crankshaft?
Thanks,
Eric&Barb
