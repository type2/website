As I understand it, belt slippage is to be expected on standard
pulleys. To prevent it, street Vees use serpentine belts, notched or
unnotched. This provides added cooling at higher RPM's.

 I was trying to come up with a way to test for belt slippage short of taking
 a direct rpm reading of both the crank pulley and the alternator pulley as
 rpm is increased, and then taking the data and checking the speed ratio of
 the two.
