Subject: Re: [VB] Reduction box rebuild and some photos of the old

Hi all

I have a 59 and 60 Kombi and have had to replace bearings and seals in the 
reduction gears several times.  I uaually take the gear system apart and 
check all the bearings for play.   If the bearing is ok I keep it if not I 
replace it.  You should have a magnetic plug for the bottom drain so if a 
bearing starts to flake the metal will not infect the other bearins. Change 
grease every few years and look for flaking.

I beleive the reduction gears are the worst part of the early bus design and 
were put in simply because of the lack of power in the early engines.  I 
have a 1600 dp and replaced the transaxel on my 59 with a bus boys IRS kit 
and absolutely love it.   It runs much quieter, gets much better milage and 
cruises at a lower temp. on the freeway.  I believe if you have a 1600 and 
do many freeway trips it is a great way to go.
