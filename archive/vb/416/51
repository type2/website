Subject: air duct intake continued

For some reason I can not find my Bentley manual.hopefully I have left it at
my mechanics.

I did find my parts manual.

I see that I may need the following part #'s, I am not sure
221845295A
And
211817773A

I see ISP west sells these parts, and their pictures match my pictures, but
their descriptions do not.
