Seriously? They look just like the ones I used as replacements on my '66. But
I bought mine eons ago and only recently actually installed them. Sorry.

  Judy those are the ones we got from Go Westy and they are about an inch or
more too long, much bigger than what is used on our '65.   Any ideas?  thanks
