Stuff in two houses is a drag (AMHIK).  But many of the chain parts
stores offer "free" loaner tools these days (you pay for the tool,
use it, and get a 100% refund when you bring it back).  If you're
lucky they will even have the kind of pressure gauge that works on a
carbongerator rather than fool injection...

>> 3. Check that choke is opening.

Along this line, the flip side of "too much gas" is "not enough air".
Is your air filter and the big hose/pipe that connects it to the top
of the carb OK?  If you have a weighted flap on your air cleaner
snorkel, is it free?  If you have one of those thermostat flap
thingies in the snorkel, is that working OK?

Ideas from further afield:

Accelerator pump diaphragm torn?  Usually this just means it stalls
when you stomp on it, but maybe it could let some gas leak to where
it shouldn't be.

Timing OK?  Spark reasonably OK?

Maybe: Park facing uphill.  Take both hoses off of fuel pump and
connect them to a short piece of hard line, bypassing the pump.  See
if it runs better on gravity (lower fuel pressure) alone.  There may
be some good reason why this won't work, though, like maybe the fuel
tank has to be 110% full for this to work.
