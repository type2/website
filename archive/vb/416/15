Subject: hehr windows

Well I have all the original Hehr crank-out windows taken apart, and given a
suggestion by chris-I will try to soda blast these on Friday. Ill let you
all know how they turn out.

One part of the frame appears to basically be > aluminum channel. It is not
in bad shape, but it may be easier to fabricate new stuff than clean up, and
reuse the existing. If my local hardware store sells the same channel, I
think I will buy a piece and try to fabricate, and see how it turns out.
Ill take pics and let you all know.
