Ronnie still sells the molded ones.   I used the non-molded the other day 
and they installed just fine.  They keep water out, but they've only been 
in a few weeks now.  (but there was a LOT of water on the drive up to 
CTS and back.. ;)

I didn't mess with any sealant, but this is a "temporary" 
install....they'll get cut back out when it comes time for paint.
