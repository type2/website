Those bearings look particularly unhappy.?? Esp the ball bearing ones, nasty pits on the races.
Did you remove the cages or did they fall apart before you had the box open?
Was there up/down slop at the stub axle? 

I really like the pictures.? Excellent.?? they really show the?bearings clearly and crisply.??
 It can be difficult to take close up pictures with good focus and really show the item well.

I am used to tihe lower outer bearing haveing the outer race loose for the?outside and thee rollers stuck to the inner race.
I would expect that someone replaced one bearing at some point.

What are other people's experience with these bearings? Does?
the wear look typical of worn ball and roller bearings? I was?
surprised to find that threearing out of the case. For?
this we followed the instructions in the idiot book and it worked?
like a charm.?
