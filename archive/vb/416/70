Hi Greg,
??????  The treasure chest is an area of the body of the SC  trucks that 
you can store stuff in under the center of the truck bed.  So  to buy a 
treasure chest you would need to buy a SC body, or if you are looking  for sheet 
metal parts of this area try _WWW.Klassicfab.com_ (http://www.Klassicfab.com) 
 or the classifieds at  WWWThesamba.com .
