Subject: RE: [VB] windows & paint....

I just found a guy/company that is going to be soda blasting a huge boat
about 20-30 minutes from my house. He said I could bring the windows to him,
and he could probably do them while I wait. He'll just take a break from
whatever he is working on. Thanks for the tip, I'm glad I got it. I hope
this works for me. If I can get them blasted on Friday-that would be great!

For my jelousie windows, I bead blasted and then painted with aluminum paint

(rattle can rustoleum) and the overcoated with some UV resistant clear. 
Looks like  a nice anodize job. I installed new tempered glass from my local

glass shop all around. I get a lot of compliments.

The bead blasting easily took off all the corrosion and left a nice surface 
finish.
