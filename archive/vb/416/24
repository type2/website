Subject: re:hehr windows

A few volks have suggested vintagetrailersupply.com for parts on these
windows.

I have gotten some stuff from them. I have found that their "Standard
Backframe gasket" is great. Appears to be an exact replica, and nice and
soft.

The other gasket material- "Hehr Standard Glass Seal" does not have the same
cross section. It is slightly different, and this difference can cause the
gasket to not stay in. I've compared it to the original that I have. It is
close, but there is a little leg that should stick out the bottom of the
gasket. This makes the gasket attach more tightly. 

I'll contact them to see if they want a sample-so they can correct their
stock.

I remember when I tried replacing one of the gaskets before, and it fell
right out. I asked them about using some sort of sealant to hold it in, and
they said it would be unnecessary. Well it was for me, and that gasket is on
the side of some highway somewhere.

I got some fasteners from them as well-"Hehr standard fasteners" These are
close to original, but the original were Phillips, and the head was a little
different. Again-this should work fine, I don't see any performance
decrease.

As for cranks, I had new cranks made for me by Blaine hardware a long time
ago-I sent them a crank, and they matched it. I have no idea what I paid,
but it couldn't have been much as I was in school at the time, and money was
tighter.

I did find a better source for the gaskets, it is made by West Coast Metric,
Part # 231-321. This is a spot on repro, that seems to grab properly, and
should not need any sealant.

I dropped the windows off with the soda-blaster this morning, they should be
ready by next week. I'll let you know how they come out.
