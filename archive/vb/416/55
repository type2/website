I like to rinse out the doglegs from time to time.?? 
Get your garden hose and spray water down through the holes in the top.
See where the water comes out at the bottom??? 
Usually some dirt/mud comes out.
the dirt being collected in there which holds water and then it rusts from the inside out. even in otherwise dry buses, particularly if they have been driven on unpaved roads.
Hope that helps.
