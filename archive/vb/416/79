Subject: Help with a bus in Witcihta

Greg Mogle (aka watchbus) is on his way from Albuquerque to Ohio to certify
himself to repair watches with a test this coming week, but he's having
problems with his generator and is hoping to be in Witchita shortly, if his
battery holds out.  He's a former Buskatier and is wondering if there's anyone
in that area who could help him out with a parts source/ work area/ maybe a
short tow so he can get to Ohio in time for his test.

Please, if anyone's available, pmail me or call me at 505-263-4600 or call
Greg at 505-280-6313.

Thanks in advance for any help,

JP
