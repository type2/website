Subject: Re: [VB] air intake gaskets?

Kevin,

I've had my fresh air vent completely apart. Installing new rubber is a 
little tricky but not too tough. The trick is to get just the right amount 
of rubber hanging out so the flaps move easily and still seal without 
whistling.  I don't have any tips for this. Maybe install them long and you 
can then trim to fit. A long process as you install, test, remove, trim and 
reinstall. Wolfsburg West sells rubber kits. May be the same one ISP is 
selling. As for the cover, I used some DAP 50 year house sealant with good 
success.

Good luck,
Chris
