Hi Kevin,
Black definitely.
? Do yourself a favor.? Take your rims and bumper splash pans to a powder coater.? Have them sand blasted, marine zinc primer, and then 80% gloss semi gloss black.? 
? Then you just need to rough up the black of the powder coating on the?outer side?of the rims, and have the painter spray them only on the outer side with the correct color of automotive paint.? Had our last set done this way (though we were able to find a close enough color?to pearl white in powder coating)?and turned out looking just like from factory.
E&B
