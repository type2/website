Hi Craig,
Would:
1.? Install a fuel pressure gauge to see what the pressure really is.
2.? Try a differant float.
3.? Check that choke is opening.
4.? Try a differant float valve.
5.? Make sure the accelerator pump nozzle is not partly clogged.

Lastly do you have jetting gauges?? If not your 125 main jet could really be a 135!
