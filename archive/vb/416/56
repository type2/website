Subject: Body filler for roof patch

Hey All,

Inspired by Kevin's project, this weekend I filled in a hole in my
roof where there used to be a crank-up vent.  Cut a patch from a chunk
of donor roof, punched & flanged it and plug welded it from the
inside.  Now I have a gap approx. 1/8" wide and the thickness of the
metal deep around the patch that needs body filler.

Any suggestions as to a type/brand of filler I should use?  I'm a
little worried about it cracking when the roof flexes (or I drop
something on it while loading the roof rack).  Also, this bus lives
outside and I have other body work that needs to be done before I
start thinking about paint.  My plan was to just fill and prime the
patch until I get it painted, but I've read that it isn't a good idea
to leave primer as the topcoat especially if the car is stored
outside.  Do I need to think about a topcoat also?

Thanks,
Tristan
