Subject: Reduction box rebuild and some photos of the old bearings

Hi All,

In the process of changing the gear oil in the transmission
of my 1966 standard, Gary Gibson and I found that the oil
from the drivers side reduction box had small flakes of metal
in it.

Gary offered to help me rebuild the reduction box so I ordered
the four bearings, the rear plug, and the gaskets and seals
from Wolfsburg West.  We rebuilt the box this last weekend.
The job wasn't difficult although we did have to make a bearing
puller to get the upper inside ball bearing out of the case.  For
this we followed the instructions in the idiot book and it worked
like a charm.

I thought people might be interested in what the bearings we
took out looked like.  I've taken some photos and posted them
on my web page.  You can see them at:

What are other people's experience with these bearings?  Does
the wear look typical of worn ball and roller bearings?  I was
surprised to find that three of the four bearings were German
and one bearing (one of the ball bearings) was Japanese.
The Japanese bearing looked like it was in good shape but
there was obvious wear on the German bearings.

Do you think that one bearing wore out first and it was replaced
without replacing the others?  Do people do that?  I would think
everyone would replace all the bearings as long as they have
the box apart.

Also, the roller bearing I got from Wolfsburg West was different
from the old roller bearing in that the rollers were attached to
the outer race on the new bearing but they were attached to
the inner race of the old bearing.  Is this a common difference?

Thanks and Cheers,
