Subject: driver side door/dog leg drainage

This is a question, not so much about the door, but the spot underneath it,
I think this is called the dog leg.

The drivers door(and passenger door as well) have holes in the bottom that
line up with holes in the top of the dog-leg. I understand that water runs
through the door, then into the dog leg, but then where does it go? This
bottom of this area was rusted pretty bad on mine. It has been patched, but
I'm worried that the drain hole has been blocked. Where is it supposed to
drain, ie where should I be looking for a drain hole?

Should I just pour water into the hole, and see where it goes?

Suggestions on where this hole is, or how water is supposed to drain would
be appreciated. I've been looking and haven't found anything yet.
