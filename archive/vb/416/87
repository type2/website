Subject: emergency brake orientation...

I noticed a long time ago that my emergency brake handle is not exactly
centered on the bus, and when you pull it, it is kind of angled towards the
driver-as you pull it back. I always thought it should be centered axially
on the bus, and when you pull it back-you would pull it directly backwards.

I guess the ergonomics are better if you are actually pulling it a little
towards you as opposed to pulling it straight back.

But I was wondering-does this mean something is bent on my bus?
