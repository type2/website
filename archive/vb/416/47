Subject: Re: butyl tape

Hi Kevin.
Simply put, due to experience.  BTDT.  Have 1960 walk thru panel  camper
conversion with one Hehr  window per side that are hinged at  the top.

  Have used roofing tar on the old sealant in a pinch to do the job,  but
that was a mess.

Butyl tape (really it is a stick/firm putty sold in a ribbon shape) is
what was used in all automotive and RV windows like these, and is the only
sealant that keeps flexable , and sticky enough to last well over twenty
years.

  Plus seeing others in our family make same mistake with their  Chinook
RV.  Tell them of the problem with other sealants, and a  month later they
had
to take it all apart again due to "leaking  again".  Several years later
after they installed butyl tape it still is  leak free.

The problem is with any other sealants that would work fine on a  house.
Automobiles shake, rattle, and flex far more on every  drive.
E&B

Why do  you recommend butyl tape on the aluminum frame to the body over any
other  type of sealing compound?
