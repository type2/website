I am looking to buy a split window bus. It needs to have a decent shell, I
am not too concerned about it having a good motor/transmission/brakes/etc.
as I want this to be a project car, so I will have to replace those things
anyway. Although, it's a definite plus if I can drive it home to San
Antonio, Texas. Feel free to contact me with any leads or suggestions not
just in Texas. Who doesn't want an excuse for a road trip anyway? Thank you!
