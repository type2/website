Subject: RE: [VB] windows & paint....

Hi Chris,

Did you get a UV block glass? I put new curtains in my bus a few years ago,
and they got wrecked pretty quickly from the UV, so I want to get something
to block the UV. I don't mind a minor tint in the glass, but don't want a
dark tint, I just want my curtains to last, and my upholstery. Also the
original upholstery in the back got dryed out and cracked, in the areas that
were exposed to the most light.

So if you bead blast, is that like sand blast-with a special blast media?
Why did you paint and clearcoat after? I would think If you blast, then you
don't need to do anything else, except maybe clear coat to get something to
last.

-Kevin

For my jelousie windows, I bead blasted and then painted with aluminum paint

(rattle can rustoleum) and the overcoated with some UV resistant clear. 
Looks like  a nice anodize job. I installed new tempered glass from my local

glass shop all around. I get a lot of compliments.

The bead blasting easily took off all the corrosion and left a nice surface 
finish.
