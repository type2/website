Subject: Re: [VB] emergency brake orientation...

Hi Kevin,

Just went and looked at my e-brake handle. Looking at the floor, its located 
about 1/2" to the right of center eyeballing on the heater duct. Its also 
tilted maybe 5 degrees toward the passenger side. Almost looks like it could 
be bent. The handle pulls directly straight back. No angle left or right.

I've never taken a close look at this before. Interesting.

Anyone else care to take a close look at their e-brake handle and comment?

Thanks,
