Hi Rob,

Yeah I was planning on sourcing from Stone-I got their info from PPG. If you
have the codes for Silver white, that would be great! I think it is L82, but
I don't know what the formula is-any extra info should help.

Thanks,

-Kevin

if you are going wit PPG (and have to buy your own paint) then go to  
stone auto body supply in watertown.  They mixed from the codes  
(Lxxx).  When I went back for silver white they had some problems but  
fortunately I brought the old can which has the mixing formula on the  
underside of the label.  let me know if you want the codes from the  
label.
