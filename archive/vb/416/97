Hi Dyer,
Yes, typical wear for bearings munching along with bits and pieces in there.? 
? Yes, the worst bearing started to go and took out the others.
???? Yes, there are those who will try to get a few more miles out of the other bearings by just replacing one.??We replace all the bearings?with the exception of the roller bearing which will long outlast the ball bearings if it shows no damage.? With carefull inspection of the other used ball?bearings after each rebuild, will?assemble up a set of good used bearings that will be used together?in a?rebuild.

?? Have not seen the outer attached roller?bearings, but that should not make a differance.
E&B
