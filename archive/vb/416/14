craig, 
start by putting in the old jets - it ran better that way no? 
if you can drive it ok with the old jets that your bus is rolling again problem #1 solved? 

personally, I think the initial choice of jets is a better *nominal* jetting. 

I would double check to see that your choke is operating as you think it should. 
Clean up the plugs as they are probably fouled and double check your timing. 

sometimes engines only idle well and so forth when they are pig rich due to things like vacuum leaks, which shouldn't be a big problem at WOT.
