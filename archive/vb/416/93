Subject: Re: [VB] emergency brake orientation...

I examined the hand brake on my 15 window '63 walk-thru bus.
Also looked at the gear shift lever. First the gear shift lever in nuetral 
has a small
amount of play or slop if you will. It can be one or two degrees off from 
vertical
left or right with the bus parked. Depending on what position you left it in 
when
you last shut your bus down.

The hand brake in my bus sits perhaps one or
two degree's from vertical leaning to the right. With the lock button 
depressed
and moving the handle foreward and aft, it tracks straight, maintaining the 
same
angle from vertical, a constant one or two degree's to the right.

I agree with Clara. I believe the small tilt of the hand brake lever is a 
design function to
allow some clearance around the gear shift lever.

 It seems like a really good ergonomic thing...has anyone looked at their
 e-brake handle...could they let me know it's orientation?

 Thanks,

 the ebrake handle does not bump into the gear shifter.

 And so the driver doesn't bend it pulling it towards themselves....
