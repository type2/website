I asked about this a few years ago when I was converting my idiot
lights to LEDs and wasn't sure if the current through an LED would be
enough to get the alt to start charging.  The list consensus was to
use a 70 Ohm, 5 Watt resistor in parallel with the LED.  The resistor
would supply about the same current as the stock bulb (although I
don't see why you couldn't run both the idiot light and gauges, unless
you are not using the stock speedo or something).  I use a green LED
for the oil pressure warning, but never got around to finishing the
other lights.
