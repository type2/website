Subject: air intake gaskets?

Well, I think I have just about stripped my bus down as much as I can. I
think the only thing left is the heater control knob, which I think I can
get out today.

I took apart the air vent intake flaps. These are the things above the
drivers head in the middle of the bus. The one that opens it to the outside,
and the one that controls the direction of airflow. 

The one that controls the airflow had a rubber/asphalty type thing on it.
One had fallen off, and the other was pretty much about to fall off. They
were both in bad shape. Has anyone taken this thing apart before, and have
ideas on what would make a good replacement gasket/seal for this?

The other flap that controls air intake has a rubber type of flap around
it's outside edge. This flap is pretty dried out. This metal piece is
riveted together, so I don't know if I want to drill out the rivets and then
re-rivet, or not. I may try to revive the rubber with some glycerin. 

The third piece of gasket/sealant stuff, appears to just be a piece of
caulking type sealant that the metal flap closed against. This appears as
though it was just squirted on there. It had all hardened and was falling
off in some places. I don't really know what to replace this with.

Any ideas or suggestions appreciated, and I apologize for the poor
description, I'm not really sure what any of these parts are called. I
should check my Bentley.
