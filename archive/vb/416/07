Omni is "wattery" as I've mentioned.  I think it is just pre-thinned higher
line PPG acryillic enamel or urethane.  You thin it less because it is already
thinned, so it probably doesn't save much, sort of that is.  I've had very
mixed luck with it.  I bought some to do the nose of a '82 beige Vanagon
camper and swear I put 6 stinking coats to cover (barely) gray primer, then I
sprayed some Toranado Red on a Corrado and it covered in 3, then some white
(which one would think would cover the same as the beige) on a Golf and it
covered in 2.  Same guy spraying (me), same Sharpe HVLP gun, same coating
technique, etc.  I would not confuse the Omni with "real" PPG paint, either
Delstar or Concept, or their old cheaper urethane (name escapes me, DBU?
line?)  I can cover damn near anything in two coats of Delstar, the third is
really for me only to bring up the gloss.  Anyway I'm a PPG guy...  But don't
compare Omni to a real Dupont paint, it ain't
 fair....
 
(Like I said, very much a Ford/Chevy debate.)
 
Oh and for anyone wondering and feeling more German, yeah I've sprayed
Glasurit, here and there a couple of times over the years, I'll take my PPG
any day.

The ppg brand was "Omni"
The dupont I don't remember just ask for the single stage arcylic.

if you guys do a good prep job ( which I'm sure you will ) it will look
awesome. That bus was in really good shape to start with in comparision to
many.
