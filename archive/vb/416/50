Subject: fresh air vent cover & butyl tape

I forgot to mention/ask.I had taken this cover off about 8 years ago. I
replaced the putty stuff on the bottom edge with plumbers putty(I think). It
held up pretty well. 

When I go to replace it, should I be using Butyl tape here as well?

I saved the three pieces of rubber for the top and sides, but these are
pretty dried out, I was thinking/hoping I could just get some additional
fresh rubber somewhere for these areas.
