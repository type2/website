Hi John,
Take off the front splash pan and get some oil (the heavier the  Wt. the
longer lasting) up in there.  Also unscrew the knob off  the handle and work
some oil down into the handle.
  As for taking it apart, DO NOT TRY THAT.  The only way to do  that is to
cut up the pin under the bus and then you have to come up with a
replacement pin.
  Far easier to just get some oil in there.
