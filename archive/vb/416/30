Dunno about the numbers, but I recall some talk on the list a few years
back that if you were looking for fuel system ROMs, Mikuni is/was a
licensee of Solex, so a clued-in Japanese motorcycle shop may have a
selection that will fit and work.  I *think* the numbering system is
the same - take an old Solex ROM and compare to a Mikuni one to be sure.
(They are also known as jets, but they are doing the same job as the
  fuel map table in memory in a fuel-injection computer.  The first
  digital fuel injection systems had the fuel map in ROM; in these
  latter days it is sometimes in flash RAM and you can reprogram it in
  the vehicle if you want.)

I just had another thought.  Google (would they lie to you?) says
Portland, Oregon - Elevation: 50 FT (15.2 M)
Phoenix, Arizona - Elevation: 1,117 FT (340 M)
which isn't all that much, but it is still different.  I bet the average
humditity in Portland is a bit higher than in Phoenix, as well.
