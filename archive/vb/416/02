Kevin,

Standard glass is a pretty good UV blocker as it is, however its not 100%. I 
would look into some fabric that is UV resistant to start with. Most 
automotive fabrics deal well with UV. Have a look at: 
www.diyupholsterysupply.com

As for the paint and clear coat rather than just clear coat, the bead bast 
finish wasn't that uniform on its own.

Cheers,
Chris

BTW, I'm looking into another theory on the engine drone noise problem. Will 
let you know what I come up with.
