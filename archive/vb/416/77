Subject: Re: [VB] Push Rod length help

I've got a lot of push rods for 40 hp 1200s through DP 1600s in the  
shed and the push rods all pretty much seem to be the same length.   
It does often make sense to custom make push rods and use rocker arm  
shims to achieve proper valve geometry.  I use shims under the  
rockers but I have one engine that I'll make my own push rods for if  
I end up using it much.  You'll always need to adjust the valve  
geometry when using swivel feet valve adjusters if you want the valve  
guides to last...
