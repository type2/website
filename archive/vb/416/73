Jim,

Are you sure you don't have your metal "clip" side upside down, perhaps? 
The shape changed, but the length never did...I have two large bay 
holddowns  (sitting around after I parted out my '69) and two empi 
baja-hood-hold-downs (left over from god knows what) on my '66.

If the clip side was attached upside down, I could see how the handles 
would seem to long.... just a thought.

wolfburg west has repops of these too (may very well be what everyone else 
is selling) that I've seen in person fit well (someday I'll get around to 
putting some on, probably after I've gotten canvas on... ;)
