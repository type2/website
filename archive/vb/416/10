Subject: paint color and locations....

Well,
I have to identify the color choices and locations. I am going with Pearl
White - L87. I believe the proper bumper color is Silver White - L82. 
This is what I was going to give the painter:

Body - L87 Pearl White
Bumpers - L82 Silver White
Nose Emblem - L82 Silver White
Rims - L82 Silver White
Interior - L87 Pearl White

I vaguely remember reading that the inside of the rims should be painted
black. Is that right? And if so what is the paint code for that-or should I
just go with any black?

Please let me know if I've made any mistakes or am forgetting anything
regarding paint colors and locations. I am trying to go stock.

Thanks,

-Kevin
