Subject: Emergency Brake in a 60

Are there any kind soles (I'm thinking that must be souls) who would send me
a couple pics for the emergency brake lever in a 60 bus ... I only have the
64 to 67 bentley and it mentions a pawl spring but the diagram doesn't show
it .. I think I might have the spring installed incorrectly and that is why
the button doesn't pop-up. 

TIA
