i think that is a factor in why it started running rich (or rich -er- 
as i did have it set rich to cool the heads in methtown, az).  but 
i'm still baffled as to the sudden dumping of fuel into the thing. 
all i can think of is that the check valve gradually loosened up just 
enough to allow a steady stream of gas under pressure  into the bowl, 
but seemed to operate fine.

at least now my symptoms seem to be more related to plain-ol' jetting 
issues!  well, that and the baseline craptacularness of the AL 
poopcase.

i am squeezing pennies to get a new vw case from john connaly and 
build this motor over.  if i can find which box i packed my tools in!
