Subject: Re: [VB] rear bumper splash pan color?

Black. on the bumper splash pans.

The rims were painted black in their entirety.?? 
NOS rims are black.
The face of the rims? (589 and later) were painted silver white.?? Just the face that you see from standing near the bus.
Not only that, but not the entire face.?? Just?a circle around the rim face.?
? It is?normal for black to be visible around the lug nut holes on original paint rims, and there to be light overspray into the isnide through the holes in the rims.

I was just realizing I am missing a splash guard..I hope it is buried
somewhere in my garage. Then I started thinking about it's color. Is it
supposed to be Silver White like the bumpers? I would think black would make
more sense.
