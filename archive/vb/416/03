Subject: windshield seals?

So when replacing windshield seals-I think Ronnie had some molded ones made,
as opposed to the repros without corners. Does anyone have feedback on how
the different types compared? I searched the archives, and I guess he had
these made in 2003, not sure what happened...I know I replaced mine once, I
cleaned up the metal, and used some tar type sealant in addition to the
gasket. It still leaked. This time the metal has been cleaned up a lot more.
Unfortunately my body guy broke the glass removing them. I told him I was
replacing, but he didn't realize I would want them for templates, and also
because they were original! They still had West Germany stamped in them.

Suggestions on sealant type appreciated.
