Paul,

Seems to be an anual event on the second Wednesday of August.
See www.bugin.com

Is that an annual event?  Please blast the list when you have the date for 
next year.  I'm planning on a big run next Summer and the PCH seemed like a 
great candidate.  If there's a bus-friendly destination along the way, so 
much the better.  If I don't run South, I'll go East to Yellowstone.
Thanks for the pix!
