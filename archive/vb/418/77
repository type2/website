Well, if you tighten the cable, you're essentially engaging the brake. 
As the shoes wear down, the cables will loosen.  So, you can start with 
a looser setup and no rubbing, or you can start with a tighter setup and 
it will wear down until it stops rubbing and be loose ;)

I'd lift it up, make sure the e-brake is completely disengaged, and 
rotate the wheels.  If there's no drag, adjust the stars until you have 
some slight drag.  Press on the brake pedal a few times and then check 
again.  If you have slight drag, you're good to go.  Do the other wheel 
so it has the same amount of drag.

Make a good habit of doing this often so that you keep the drum brakes 
in check.  It's a pain to do all of this, but well-maintained drum 
brakes will work well and be easy to repair when it's time for new 
shoes.  Anti-seize is very handy for the adjustment stars...

BTW, my experience is on a 78, so I'm not sure how much the drum brakes 
differ between the years.  Hope that helps!
