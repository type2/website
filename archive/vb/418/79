You might also check your brake line connections to make sure you are  
not losing any fluid after bleeding the brakes. There could be a slow  
leak that is causing the mushiness in the brakes, or it could also be  
your master cylinder needs replacing or rebuilding.  Hope not as the  
67 only dual master cylinders are pricey.

YMMV,
