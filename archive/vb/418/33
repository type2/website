That happened to me on my 63. I did not discover until I got a
replacement transmission and pulled the original transmission that it
only needed a little lubrication and coaxing to free up and start
working again. Just pull the nose cone and get some oil in there and
gently work the  shift rod and turn the output shafts.

 Q:  my 66 had been sitting for many years.  the rear shift rod coupler
 was broken and I replaced it yesterday.  Problem:  the shift rod will
 move from side to side but does not appear to want to move forwards or
 backwards.

 It appears the tranny is in neutral ( engine out but the shaft does not
 move when the rear wheels are spun)

 Anyone have any suggestions?? Sure hope the tranny doesn't need
 replacing!!
