Subject: Re: [VB] shift rod bushings

there are two badminton birdie looking plastic bushings on the long rod.?? You have to slide the rod out of the tube under the bus, and remove the old bushing.?? the new one slides onto the?rod and a bump pops into a hole in the rod.?? The repro bushings have messy molds, you may have to clean up the flashing with a box cutter.

To replace the rear one you must remove the tranny and pull the rod back.

At this point, take a old cable on a drill and roto rooter the shift tube and blow the dust and rust out with compressed air.

Then push an oily rag through there (with teh shift rod) to lube up the inside of the tube.

Grease the new bushings well before re-installing the long rod.



if you don't have the tranny out, you can remove the front coupler and the front rod and pull the rear rod forward and repalce the forwards bushing on the rear rod.



There are rubber dust seals for the ends of the shift rod tube



There is also a front shift bushing, which you have to remove the front shift rod to replace.

Removing ?the coupler between front and rear shift rods tends to be a problem.? soak daily with pentrating oil.? every day for at least a week.
