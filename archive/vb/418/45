I have a swing axle freeway flier in my bus. the change was effected by 
installing a 3.88 R&P in place of the stock 4.125. This represents 
approximately 6% increase in gear ratio for all gears. Mileage on the 
freeway was increased by about 2 mpg. This will have a small affect on your 
climbing power on hills. I also recommend an increased engine size. I have a 
1776.
