I don't have personal experience with that, but from what I have read,

 In any event, the question is:  does the floor attach to the driver's
 side skin??  That side is in good shape and I'd hate to damage it trying
 to remove the lip of the floor.

 Or, does the floor just attach to the frame alone.  Any info would be
 appreciated.
