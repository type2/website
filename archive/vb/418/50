Hi John,

When the earlier gears slide on you have sanded enough.

? Of course you can always just use a set of caliphers to measure the gear tooth ID.? Then lathe the gear teeth on the pinion to a few one thousands below that.? We would do that since Eric has access to  those tools and more.

? Our tranny rebuilder does it so often that he has the sanding with a belt sander and hand eye coordination down to a science.



Have done hand sanding on crankshaft pullies to get them to JUST slip on.? Sand pulley ID in rotation direction.? Slip pulley onto crankshaft till it starts to get stuck.? Pull the pulley back off.? Stuck marks inside the pulley will be 90 degrees out from direction of rotation hand sanding, so stuck marks show up really well.? Hand sand the stuck marks in same direction till they disappear, and then sand in rotation direction to erase the stuck mark clearancing sanding marks.? Install the pulley again till it just starts to stick again, and repeat sanding procedures till the pulley slides on by hand.

??? E&B
