Subject: Cargo floor question

just removed the cargo floor from the 66 bus.  Only took about seven
hours of back breaking labor.

In any event, the question is:  does the floor attach to the driver's
side skin??  That side is in good shape and I'd hate to damage it trying
to remove the lip of the floor.  

Or, does the floor just attach to the frame alone.  Any info would be
appreciated.
