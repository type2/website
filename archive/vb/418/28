Great.  I bought mine 10 years ago or so, it was a little better quality one
at the time, cost about $350 then, probably no better than a $150 H-F one
today.  Some caveats, they pull in a very small local area, so obviously you
need lots of studs applied to a crease or dent, just like you would drilll
holes for a slide hammer.  Don't try to overdo with too few studs, lots of
little pulls, can still do hammer off technique adjacent etc.  The little
clamps that hold a line of studs are nice but not requisite, you just take
your time if you need to.  You can only do so much of course, don't expect to
do anything that you wouldn't have done with slide hammer (well maybe a bit
more as it works somewhat better) just a lot more convenient, doesn't leave
holes.  I figure about any one that works is good enough quality, how long it
lasts may be the issue.  And of course, your base metal has to be in good
shape, obviously.

anyone ever use one?? I wonder how well they work for pulling out
dents.
