Subject: Shift rod question

On the 66 Bus, the shift rod in front rides on a stud under the shifter
plate.  There is no shift rod guide, just the stud.

The frame piece is going to be replaced (E-brake bracket is completely
rotted away)

The frame piece I bought (I have only seen pictures so far: in transit)
does not appear to have the "stud" on it.  I believe this mechanism was
changed mid year in 66 and I have a late year model.

Question:  couldn't I just use the usual shifter bracket, bushing, etc.
or should I attempt to attach the "stud" to the new  piece.  I believe
all 66s used the same shift rod piece.

Thanks for any info.
