Subject: Re: [VB] windshields?

ISP installed one on my bus when they restored it. So far so good. BTW, the 
cheapo swap glass I supplied cracked when they tried to install it. I like 
gaskets from West Coast Metric.

Any recommendations on sourcing windshield glass? Unfortunately my body guy
broke the windshields when removing them, and so I don't even have anything
to make a template from.

I remember that the thickness was an odd thickness, or rather a metric
thickness as opposed to 1/8", right?

I see ISP west sells them. Anyone get glass from them, do they fit well with
the gaskets?

Thanks for any suggestions.
