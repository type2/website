Subject: Re: [VB] cargo door plate

the lock plate isn't welded in place, but is in a cage.
This means you can move the plate around, which allows you to adjust the position of the door.

I've heard of the falling down problem before.?? I guess the plate escapes from the cage, and flips you off.?? ha ha, it's free!!!!??
