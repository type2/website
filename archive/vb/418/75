Hello, first time posting...
Columbia MO is a good place.  If you need VW assistance you can visit Walt's
VW on College Ave.  or Tom's Imports off of Business Loop 70.  I have dealt
with both, you may have better luck at Walt's with the split window.  There is
good Thai food on Cherry St. downtown, a local brewery around the corner
called Flat Branch(good tastin stuff!).  Camping in that area is either south
on Hwy 63, check out 3 Creeks(east of ashland mo in the Mark Twain National
Forest.. good spot),  or go north on 63 to Finger Lakes(camp sites w/ or w/o
hookups), also nice.
West of Columbia 10 miles is a connection to the MKT trail in Rocheport(take
40/240 at the midway exit for the rural route).  This trail goes through KS MO
and TN and at this location the trail runs at the base of a 75ft cliff on the
northern shore of the MO river.  Perfect place to stop(sunsets!).  There is
also a winery there sitting on top of the bluff overlooking the river(pricey
though).  10 miles west is a casino in Booneville(if you're into that), you'll
see the billboards.
Have a good trip,
JP
