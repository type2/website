The length of the piston from its round end to the closest face of the  
adjusting bolt is supposed to be 2.75" +- (70 mm).  That will give   
the proper pressure on the cylinder to get max. braking effect?  The  
one I just did recently was 3/8" short, & after I adjusted that, the  
brakes were like brand new!

YMMV,
