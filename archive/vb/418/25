Subject: Re: [VB] windshields?

I have gotten repo windshields from BFY-all the current manufacturer's  
glass is in inches, not metric & it is slightly thicker & thus harder  
to fit into the seals, which makes it a PITA to install.  If you can  
get used OG glass,  say on the Samba, you are much better off IMHO.

YMMV,
