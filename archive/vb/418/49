Yeah, the one I was looking at is the b67 in VT.



I have thought about driving the b69 back, but driving a single cab is not
as much fun on the road trip end of things and I donbt really have time-work
is pretty hectic  right nowb&part of the reason I would appreciate having my
pickup truck. I did drive my squareback from CA to MA a few years ago, and
that was pretty fun.



Is there anything in particular you remembered about the single cab? Ie rust
issues? Dents/dings not apparentb& Ibm trying to avoid a close to full day
trip to check out a bus, if it isnbt really worth the effort. Based on
feedback so far, it sounds like I should stay with keeping mine.

67's do have the sway bar in the front but in reality you won't notice the
difference, it will drive like a late mode (64-67) split bus

Is the 67 in VT?  If so, they had that at Litchfield and it looked better in
the pictures IMO.

My guess is that the 69 is a cleaner vehicle.

Right now I have a couple split window buses, one thing I like is its easy to
"stock" parts or steal from one to keep the other going.

Why not drive the 69 back east?  just did it in a 67 and it was a blast.
