I made a wide five drum puller from an old Fiat X1/9 / 124 brake disc as 
it's just about the right diameter and clears the drum casting in the 
middle. Drilled five holes in the disc on the drum PCD, bolt it to the 
drum using the wheel bolts and use a puller bar with big bolt to push 
against the axle.  Zero cost - works well.
