Subject: Re: [VB] crank start

Here are the 4 components for an early Split Bus crank start. 
Rear apron with hole for handle to pass through. 
Rear engine tine with flap that covers the hole that the handle passes through. 
Crank start handle. 
Special crankshaft pulley nut.

The 36hp buses came with the hand crank as well as the electric starter.
The cranking system was dropped in mid 59.
If you have a 36hp engine in your 60 you could use the pieces from a 59/earlier.
But if you have a later engine you will need to modify a later rear tin as a 36hp/crank start tin one won't fit a later motor

Also, the crank handle was made longer when they went to the 59 bumper., so it clears the fatter bumper.
You'll want to find a 59 crank handle, which is a little harder than a 58 & earlier one.

If the engine is a bit worn it's easier to crank start. With good compression it's a bit harder.
?I heard that crank start was an option for things, which had 1600 motors.
?I guess that means there is later crank tin around somewhere.

My 60 has the hole in the rear apron for a crank start . I've been told I'd need a special nut on that bottom pulley to make a crank start work ..anyone have such a thing? 

 I'm thinking it would be nice to just have one battery but be able to drain it completely if I needed to and use a crank start. I have the manual choke
working and it works like a charm .. so I think the crank start would be cool .  I just need the pieces.
