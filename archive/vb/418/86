I doubt it with only 20,000 miles on it. It's probably in the adjustment 
somewhere. You mentioned needing to adjust the fronts too. That's 
probably going to make a big difference in the pedal. Check all the free 
and cheap options before throwing more money at it. That's a reminder I 
need frequently.
