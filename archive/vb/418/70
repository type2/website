Hi Tom,

We're here in St. Louis, Mo.  Stop to check out the Gateway Arch and
underground museum about the "Westward expansion".  Lots of great food around,
contact me if you get into trouble and or want more tourist details at
bill(-at-)bnnta.com

If you are coming back around Sept 4-7th, we will be hosting a big VW camping
weekend on Mark Twain Lake up near Hannibal, MO.  Go to this simple site for
more info on the BNNTA VW campout over the Labor Day weekend:

Have a safe and scenic trip!
