Hi Harry,
Plus with the IRS conversions you have to lower the front suspension to match the new lower rear suspension.? Resulting in more $$$$ and time.
? While the Freeway Flier is going to cost you more than a stock rebuild.? You can save more than the cost of the rebuilt transaxle in better MPG and longer engine longevity.
