Subject: vanagon kitchen in a non-walk through ... 

I'm turning my standard microbus into a camper .. I put on a poptop ..
(similar to a small westy top) and a z-bed from a 68 to 71 westy (seems to
fit much better than a late westy z-bed) . I was planning on having having a
cabinet built for behind the bulkhead .. with fridge, stove, sink etc..
something like the calypsocamper stuff .. but I have come across a Vanagon
unit .. 80 to 83 vanagon kitchen thing . never used .. 100% mint .. I'm
thinking jump seat behind driver .. vanaon unit . table that opens up when
cargo doors are open .. z-bed .. cabinet up to bottom of windows beside
z-bed that runs to the rear of the bus .. over the z-bed cabinet . propex
heater mounted under the bus feeding into the heat pipe  . anyway .. what
about the vanagon kitchen .. anyone ever see anything like that done .. I
know lots of bay stuff goes in early buses .. I'd have to make the vanagon
stuff fit asthetically . mount a propane bottle underneath for stove,
fridge, propex heater . IDEAS???????
