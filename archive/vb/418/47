The '67 will drive identical to your '65 (well, except it's got a bit less 
side surface for wind to hit).  Assuming it's still remotely stock, 
it's effectively the same bus.  Same suspension, same transmission, same 
gearing, roughly the same engine.   Only major difference is that all 
'67 buses were 12v from the factory.
