I run a jurasic period Delta CD ignition on my bus. Been doing it since 
about 1977. The plus sides: points last 20,000+ miles. Plugs last 20-30000 
miles. Dizzy cap needs an occasional cleaning. Pretty much stretches the 
tune up cycle out to 6-10,000 miles. Just need to clean and gap the points 
and plugs. And oh yeah, lube the cam in the dizzy.  Too bad they don't make 
an equivalent add on for the valve train, maybe that's what hydraulic 
lifters are for?
