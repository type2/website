That's good news. I always go on the assumption that at one time these
vehicles were cared for by a mechanic and were only abandoned when
something broke, and if you can locate that problem and fix it, you
will have a running bus after you do the safety items like brake
hoses, etc.

So unless your bus went out of service because of a transmission
problem, you most likely have a good one which will be serve you well.
It is possible for excessive corrosion to prevent it returning to
service, but most likely it will be okay.

List members might caution otherwise, but if it was mine, I'd run it
20 minutes with ATF in it to finish the cleanup process, then drain it
to get all the rust and dirt out before refilling with gear oil.

 last night, jacked up the rear end (to get the ATF to flow in the right
 direction) and in about an hour the hockey stick shaft was free!!!
