67's do have the sway bar in the front but in reality you won't notice the difference, it will drive like a late mode (64-67) split bus 

Is the 67 in VT? If so, they had that at Litchfield and it looked better in the pictures IMO. 

My guess is that the 69 is a cleaner vehicle. 

Right now I have a couple split window buses, one thing I like is its easy to "stock" parts or steal from one to keep the other going. 

Why not drive the 69 back east? just did it in a 67 and it was a blast.
