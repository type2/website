Sand pulley ID in rotation direction.? Slip pulley onto crankshaft till it
starts to get stuck.? Pull the pulley back off.? Stuck marks inside the pulley
will be 90 degrees out from direction of rotation hand sanding, so stuck marks
show up really well.? Hand sand the stuck marks in same direction till they
disappear, and then sand in rotation direction to erase the stuck mark
clearancing sanding marks.? Install the pulley again till it just starts to
stick again, and repeat sanding procedures till the pulley slides on by hand.
