I would suggest Rust Bullet while you are in there. In my experience,
anti-rust paints and rust converters have been inadequate.  Even
POR-15 is only a rust encapsulator, not a rust treatment.

Good job on the plate recovery, by the way.

While I have it open I plan on putting some anti-rust paint in there.
