Subject: Re: [VB] crank start

John,
There is a special nut involved. Its kinda like a ratched and pawl. 
Here is a link to one for sale on The Samba.

My 60 has the hole in the rear apron for a crank start . I've been told I'd
need a special nut on that bottom pulley to make a crank start work ..
anyone have such a thing?
