Subject: windshields?

Any recommendations on sourcing windshield glass? Unfortunately my body guy
broke the windshields when removing them, and so I don't even have anything
to make a template from.

I remember that the thickness was an odd thickness, or rather a metric
thickness as opposed to 1/8", right?

I see ISP west sells them. Anyone get glass from them, do they fit well with
the gaskets?

Thanks for any suggestions.
