Subject: Re: [VB] Mallory Hyfire 6a

Anyone using a Hyfire ignition box?  What do think of it, any  
improvement on
MPG or general running?

In my 66 I made the progression of a 6a then later added the Mallory  
Unilite distro.  Both were good upgrades by my count.  I can say  
however that moving to the Hyfire 6a was by far the best and  
noticeable improvement.  MPG it didn't make much different, however it  
idles like there is no tomorrow smooth, and I did gain about 2 mpg,   
Some of the intangibles were that when I had to smog the bus it passed  
with flying colors, in addition the plugs when I check them look  
great.  I ended up going with the NGK plugs that have the -11  
postfix.  They are gapped a bit more than stock right out of the box.
