Here's an idea that I will look into. A 12V electric solenoid valve in the 
fuel line from the tank. Wire the valve into the ignition circuit so that 
when the key is off, fuel cannot flow. In case of a fire, shutting off the 
ignition will stop the flow of fuel, leaving only that in the line to the 
pump, to the carb and that left in the bowl.

I currently have a manual ball valve in my tank line for engine removal 
convenience. Might be a stretch to crawl under the bus to shut off in case 
of emergency.

Of course you guys with the fuel injection already have something like this.
