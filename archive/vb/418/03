Subject: RE: [VB] z bed from bus depot

Yeah ... a real z-bed or kit to make a z-bed would be cool ... I'd love to
but my rear seat back in and use it as a bed ... I had a full-width westy
bed in my 60 for years ... I never really liked it .. it worked OK but it
didn't seem to sit high enough .. that is, the elevation between the foam
and the plywood was not the same as the elevation at the top of the engine
bay. 

I recently bought a westy bed that I was told was from a pre-67 bus ... I
popped it in and it is perfect .. I went to an upholstery shop and got the
highest density foam I could get to put over the engine bay .. it's perfect
.. as it turns out I now suspect it was from a 68 to 73 westy ... seems to
fit much better than the 74 bed
.
