Subject: Cheap insurance against a Bus disaster...

This (lost Bus due to fire and no extinguisher) is the exact reason why I have
"at least" one fire extinguisher in each
Bus I own (four of them currently), and two in one of them, (and a couple of
'em are Halon units!) with more to
come.  Used quickly, one will do the trick, but buy two per Bus for extra
insurance!  Mount them within easy reach as you "bail out" of a smoking Bus.
A single
dry chem fire extinguisher costs less than $20, INCREDIBLY CHEAP insurance
against a total loss!

I am so bummed to hear of your loss.  But why didn't you have a fire
extinguisher on board?  List threads talk about them quite often.  I really
hope
you find another Bus soon to replace yours, and I hope the rest of you are
on the way to the store to pick up the safety item that you're missing.
