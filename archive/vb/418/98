Fabuluous. The very best camping unit I've used was in my '80 Vanagon.

For the 14 years I owned it, I thought about doing what you are doing; using a Vanagon kitchen unit in a splitty.

For me, the simpler the better. Pare down the kitchen unit to the basics, sink stove storage. Self contained and removeable. The Vanagon unit fits the bill perfectly. Make the rear seat fold into a bed, and using the swing out doors for tables, inside or out, good to go.

The trickiest part I foresaw would be making a connector from the stove to a propane tank mounted outside underneath for safety. Water tank and pump inside the cabinet. Storage for cook gear and food.

After using various campers, I'd avoid the rear cabinets and just use suitcases, duffle bags, or whatever for personal gear.

Finding a Vanagon unit that is pristine is icing on the cake. The very best stove I've ever seen is that one. The stoves in the highest end US RVs are cheesy in comparison.
