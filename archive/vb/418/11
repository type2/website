Saw this on Craigslist and it's been listed for a while so I thought I'd pass
it on.  I have no affliation with the seller.

1965 VW Panelvan Bus

-Has all the usual rust. Doglegs, inner/outer rockers, front floors, and lower nose. Cargo floor is in fairly good shape, and the upper side panels, roof, and nose areas are all straight and free of rust.
-Cargo door latches, rear decklid, and front doors all have good working latches and hardware
-uncut dash and both front seats included though they need recovered
-no engine included, but has a good working tranny with gear reduction boxes
-numerous spare parts including replacement metal for taillights, front turn signals, extra complete drivers door, all new rubber seals, new front glass, and a lot of other small things.
-comes with 2 extra VW bug 15" wheels along with the widened steelies the previous owner installed, and he cut the rear arches. Easy fix, but as you can see they are cut.
-needs brakes all around
-front emblem in very good shape
-complete headlights
-newer front and rear "slash" bumpers

Pics are from a couple months back, but the Bus hasn't moved since then

I'm not really trying to get rid of this, but I have found another car that is more inline for me as a project right now. I know how much these are worth, and how hard it is to find one with 80% of the current metal to be usable. This one does need work, but can be put back on the road in the right hands. I do have a title for it also. No tire kicking please. If you are serious about it, call me and we can talk.

No reasonable offer will be refused

Call anytime before 10pm and leave a message if no answer. Ill get back to you

email or call with any questions. Thanks for viewing
