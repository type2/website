Subject: bus paint ? interior grey, cargo floor plugs and more...

Hey guys, more questions.

 

I am back to the bus work. I have now got my bus to the new paint shop. I
have been scuffing the rear interior of my bus, to prep properly to have it
painted. It looks like the correct color for this area should be L345, light
grey. Again this chip does not seem to match the small spots of original
gray I can still see.

 

Do I have the right code for this spot? This is for a 1965 kombi, the rear
part which is not the color of the body exterior or front seat area.

 

I also noticed  some threaded inserts near the back on either side of the
interior. I was wondering what is supposed to screw into these. I was
thinking maybe seat belts, but the inserts seem too small for that. I know
my model didn't have anything screwed in there, as they were covered by the
interior panels, but I was just wondering.

 

I have also noticed these little rubber black plugs and some white plastic
plugs in the cargo floor. It appears as though these are designed to keep
water-if spilled on the cargo floor, inside the bus. If I pull these plugs
the seem to drain into the rocker panels, and then out. I would think it
would make sense not to put these plugs back after painting. Previously I
had water spill under the flooring, and it had no way out-so it caused some
of the worst rust damage.

 

Is there some reason to put these plugs back?

 

Thanks for any advice.
