And by the way... I do appreciate all the advice/info you folks send to
me.

Q:  my 66 had been sitting for many years.  the rear shift rod coupler
was broken and I replaced it yesterday.  Problem:  the shift rod will
move from side to side but does not appear to want to move forwards or
backwards.

It appears the tranny is in neutral ( engine out but the shaft does not
move when the rear wheels are spun)

Anyone have any suggestions?? Sure hope the tranny doesn't need
replacing!!
