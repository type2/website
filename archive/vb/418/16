Subject: crank start

My 60 has the hole in the rear apron for a crank start . I've been told I'd
need a special nut on that bottom pulley to make a crank start work ..
anyone have such a thing? 

 

I'm thinking it would be nice to just have one battery but be able to drain
it completely if I needed to and use a crank start. I have the manual choke
working and it works like a charm .. so I think the crank start would be
cool .  I just need the pieces.
