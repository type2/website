Hi Volks,

Had a great day at Big Wednesday. Was my first experience surfing. Lived
within 2 miles of the beach for the last 37 years, can you believe it!

My buddy's beater surfer split bus ran flawlessly. We road down to the event
via the famous Highway 1, Pacific Coast Highway. Lots of people waving and
smiling at us on the way down and all the way back. Its about a 70 mile trip
from Torrance to San Onofre. Had 3 boards in the back. Stopped at In-n-Out on
the way back, had a double meat and fries. Yumm.

Here is a link for some photos. Enjoy.
