Sadly, today, my bus was rear ended. I'll be taking it back to ISP West for
diagnosis and repairs. The bulk of the damage is in the driver side quarter.
Bumper badly twisted, small damage to engine cover. Can't quite open the
engine cover as it catches on the RH overrider. Muffler sprung a leak. Still
driveable, but lookin' bad. Was lookin forward to driving into the Big
Wednesday meet next week in San Onofre.  :-( :-(
