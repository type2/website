Subject: Re: [VB] Tranny conversion

While you can do an IRS conversion, you can also get your tranny rebuildt.?? 

Are you thinking of installing IRS because a friend has one around, or are you wanting to change your gear ratios?? 

It is not a straightforward easy bolt in swap to go IRS, so you will have to buy more stuff and spend more time.

Installing a used tranny is always a lottery, unless you have driven the car it comes out of.??If you have more time than money you might feel better about playing the lottery.? If you have less time, you might want to get a rebuild.

?A tranny rebuildt lasts a long time as long as you keep oil in it.

If you are wanting to change your gearing you?can choose higher gear ratios while keeping the swing/ RGBs.



What is your current tranny doing (or not doing)?

Sometimes a problem can be solved by replacing a shift coupler, installing new shift bushing or tranny mounts, or replacing a?worn shift stick.
