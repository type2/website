Re: Single-Cab swap...

I love Splittys, own four currently and write about 'em in my column in Hot
VWs.  But based on what I have read from you, you need to just drive or get
your '69 Single-Cab back East.  It sounds nice already, you know it, you seem
to like it.  It is also much rarer that the Splitty version, it's faster and
improved over time.  I would warn you against taking on a project bigger that
it sounds like you have the time to mess with, when you already have a sound,
cool truck.  Just fly out and drive it back, ship it or pay someone else to
drive it and fly them back.
