Subject: Re: [VB] z bed from bus depot

I keep waiting to see an actual Z bed....  I couldn't find one on Busdepot
site... but I did find a Rear Sofabed Kit
For putting Westfalia style Rear Sofabed in non-camper. Includes metal
brackets/components, and instructions for using your own
wood/foam/upholstery.

is that what you mean?

sorry,, I can't answer your question for certain.. I do know a lot of folks
have had difficulty installing a late model bed in a Split
