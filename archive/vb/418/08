Subject: Re: [VB] steering column

You forgot to disconnect the drag link.? :)

I have put a bus on ramps and pulled the steering column out.
Also, my floor jack lifts the bus high enough.? Not the small $20 traveling size floor jack, but the regular shop size.?
? not super sized .

Removing the steering wheel can be tricky.? You can now buy a puller for that

1. dig deep hole in ground. 
2. position bus over said hole.
3. remove steering wheel.
4. unbolt steering column
5. unbolt steering gear box.
6. allow steering column to drop down into hole.
7. move bus away from said hole.
8. remove steering column from said hole.
9. done.

Alternatively, lift the bus high enough to lower the column out the bottom.
Best of luck with your floor replacement.

Cheers.

what is the best way to remove it?? have to replace the entire cab floor
as well as the cargo floor.  Also, will need to "unhook" the heater tube
in the front to get the new floor panel in.
