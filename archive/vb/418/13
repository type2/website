Wow..that sucks. I'm sorry that there are people out there with modern cars
whose brakes don't work as well as a 45 year old vehicle!

 

I mean come on, unless the car is older than the bus, it should be able to
stop without rear-ending you, unless they were tailgating. Naw..I'm sure
they weren't doing that. I know I never get tailgated while driving my bus. 

 

Sorry.I hope it is repairable.
