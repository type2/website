Subject: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas: Spots to hit on a Leisurely Drive

Volks,

My lovely girlfriend and I will be taking the splitty on a trip out to Colorado
on Friday (was going to take the '71, but alas, the TurboDiesel conversion is 
not going to be finished in time...).  

We're coming from Pittsburgh, PA and figure on taking I-70 (roughly) but we're
actively interested in cool things to do off the highway or on parallel routes,
maybe even as far south as the Wichita-ish?  Anyone have tips on good drives,
diners, parks to take the dog for a walk in or camping spots?  

We're going to try to do the trip in 2.5 days-ish, so we have some time, but not
heaps.

Any tips are appreciated!

And if you see a white splitty with PA tags, honk and wave!
