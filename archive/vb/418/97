I've always enjoyed that layout the best, and thought the best way to
get one at a reasonable price was to get one from a late bay.

I've thought about dispensing with the regular propane tank and using
and adaptor to use small Coleman-type propane cans you buy at WalMart,
etc.

Also thinking about the Coleman cool box with the cigarette lighter
adapter instead of messing with the Dometic.

I've been camping in too many buses without cabinents to want to keep
using bags, etc. I'm really looking for cabinents to keep things
organized. I would also like to have it permanently equipped so I
don't have to pack and unpack for every trip.

 Fabuluous. The very best camping unit I've used was in my '80 Vanagon.

 For the 14 years I owned it, I thought about doing what you are
doing; using a Vanagon kitchen unit in a splitty.

 For me, the simpler the better. Pare down the kitchen unit to the
basics, sink & stove plus storage. Self contained and removeable. The
Vanagon unit fits the bill perfectly. Make the rear seat fold into a
bed, and using the swing out doors for tables, inside or out, good to
go.

 The trickiest part I foresaw would be making a connector from the
stove to a propane tank mounted underneath. Water tank and pump inside
the cabinet. Storage for cook gear and food.

 After using variuos campers, I'd eliminate the rear cabinets and just
use suitcases, duffle bags, or whatever.
