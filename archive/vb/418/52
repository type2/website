Hi John,
Glad you like the pulley sanding procedure.
? We do carry an original VW of Brazil tool for removing the pulley, but so nicer to just have it slip off.? 
? Why carry the tool?? For others we come across who need repair help, or for the time we come across an engine at a swap meet that has the pulley we need for another engine.
E&B
