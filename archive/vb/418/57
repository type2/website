Subject: cargto door plate

Well, I was taking my front cargo door off, and the metal plate inside the
frame of  the bus fell down into the rocker panel! Damn.

Today I went at it with some 19 gauge metal wire, and a flashlight and a
long magnet-pointer thingy.

Luckily I was able to get the plate out. Then I was trying to figure out how
to get it back in, and dropped it back into the hole!!!! DAMN.

I tried fishing it out again, with little luck. I got a bit tired, and
figured I would take a break, and get back to it on Monday.

Questions..
1-Any ideas on ways to get this plate out?
2-any Ideas on how to get this plate installed properly?
3-how was this plate put in there originally?

I think my last resort is to cut a hole on the inside pillar so I can access
it, I'd rather not, but this may be my only option.

I vaguely remember reading about this on the list, but when I search, I'm
having no luck in the search.
