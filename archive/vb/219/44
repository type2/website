I cannot say if the 243 is the right one for the job, but recently I
wrote loctite and asked which would be good for use in my type4 style

Jason,

For a removable sealant, you can try PST 565. For a permanent lock/seal, try
Threadlocker 277. Once fully cured, both will have very good resistance to oil.

You can download the datasheets from our website, and find a distributor using
the Distributor Locator menu option.

Regards,

Cathy
