Looks like it may have been Pearl White originally (L87?). The icebox also looks to be out of a post '67 Westfalia. The sink is the dead give away; they are much taller than a split icebox and splits never had a sink (in a SO-42). You can use a closet out of a baywindow too, but I forget the year that is compatable.
Tables out of a late model will work as well, but they do have a different "finished edge" material on some years. Grab the whole thing too, even the mount on the floor if it's there !
That year has a cool emergency flasher switch too! Hopefully, you won't need it!
