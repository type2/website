Is the longer shock on the taller side of the bus?  If so I'd say it has a
good chance of being at least part of the problem.

I didn't catch this thread the first time around so bear with me.

Is this a problem that just started or has this been around since you got
the bus? (or perhaps you just got the bus?)

If the long shock is on the tall side of the bus I'd suggest disconnecting
BOTH rear shocks then lowering the bus back to ground.

Remeasure your two sides and see if this helps.  If it does, replace both
rear shocks!

If it doesn't change anything, and this isn't a new problem, then I'd
begin to suspect that whoever lowered your bus didn't lower the two sides
equally.

BTW, in the picture you posted I cannot tell that your bus leans.
