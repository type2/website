Thanks! They are cheap passenger tires I can take a look and tell you what they are if you would like. Off hand I think they are M+S 205-75-15.
I do have the outlet on the rear drivers side, but I have never used it.. I think that changed with the late '67 models as they had back-up lights. 
You'll get there, don't worry. I took me nine years to get her where she is now!, and I'm still doing things here and there! I love all the bits too! I think that's one of the neatest things about old VW's, all the stuff you get for 'em. I remember talking to a guy at a show and he was asking me about the gas heater and if I liked it. I told him it worked great and blah, blah, blah. He had been told by one of the "guru's " from socal that " ..you shouldn't put anything extra on a bus that it didn't come with". I told him to do what you like. Not all of us have access to 1500 pistons/cylinders !
