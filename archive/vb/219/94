Subject: RE: [VB] International Travel Questions

I just emailed a French friend of mine... the feelings are mutual I
think in that it's a political issue.  Each has their monetary (mainly)
concerns.   

Everyday schmos like us are all pretty much friends with common goals
and ambitions.  I think the best advise to the paranoid SO is that if
you go over with hostilities, prepare to have some returned... You WILL
encounter people that want to engage you regarding the issues; just
remember to keep the discussion open and respect each others view
points.  To win will be to allow all parties to achieve some
satisfaction.  And hell, you just might learn something :-O 

The best is simply look, eat, and enjoy the people and place.  Greet
them and they will greet back in a most favorable way :-)
