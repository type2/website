I'm not sure if this reasoning will work with here or not, but here
goes. Especially in this climate there is a lot of anti-french
feelings out there. But ask you wife. If a frech person was over here
visiting & was a nice plesant person, would you try and hurt them just
because the governments of 2 countries disagree over something? Remind
her that not everyone in a country really care. The only people it
matters to directly are the ones who will be impacted finacially by
any major world decision or the politically charged. Not everyone is
like that. Just don't go like Basil in Faulty Towers did with his
German customers & keep bringing up the war :)
