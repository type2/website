Subject: RE: [VB] Accel cable: rear guide sleeve over tranny?

I cut a Beetle accelerator cable bowden tube down about 1 inch and greased
the cable, made pedal feel much nicer. I think 597 mm? is the measurement
for a 66.

Joe,

Take an appropriate length of rubber VW fuel line (around 16" or so), and
slip it over that part of the accel cable, and it will stop eating your
tranny case. No grease needed. Took me decades to figure that out!
