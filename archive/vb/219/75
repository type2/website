Volks,

Talk of Snap-on and Mac.  I don't doubt they are superior tools to Craftsman.
BUT, for the hobbyist, it isn't practical to buy them.  Ever try to find a
salesman?  Oh, you do, every once in a while.  You pass them on the road or
spot them at a mechanics shop.  Big ole trucks full of tools. drool.  BUT, if
you happen to get a salesman and buy some tools, how do you get broken ones
replaced?  Sears and Craftsman, they are everywhere.  I can remember in the
60's they carried very few metrics in the stores.
