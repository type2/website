  I think Mexican Boges are made in the same factory as CoFap. I think these
shocks work great on a light bus. I would not use them on a Westy or camper,
or any bus that carrys a load. I have used them both in light duty buses
without a problem. They are just an oil shock and not a nitrogen filled
shock as GR 2's or gas-a-just , which in my opinion and experience give a
harsher ride in a light bus (S/C, empty panel van etc.) 
  You could always use bilstein which have great valving and work great on a
light or heavy bus.
  One thing people need to realize is the valving in shocks and what they
are desigined to do. I have tried most brands (major) on my buses and have
found that different shocks do different jobs.
  On my 60 DC that I am putting a Porsche 356 engine in I am using KONI
adjustable shocks on all 4 corners, these work EXCELLENT but at 150 dollars
a piece hurts (I just happen to have a few sets from previous projects left
over).


ronnie  just a shocking experience

I have to say the BOGEs are dissapointing.
