Subject: RE: [VB] International Travel Questions

My sister in law refuses to fly anywhere!  It's tough with some people.

I think that regardless of the current political climate; Belgians,
Germans, French, etc. etc. are still hospitable to us crumby americans.
It never hurts to be prudent and watch ones actions a bit more at times
but I don't think a trip like this one should be one of huge concern.
