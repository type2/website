Travelling on a Yankqui passport is always a tad iffy, but hey, you are going
to Europe.  Germans are pretty cool about us, US, U.S.  You'll be fine.
Hamburg is where there is a nest of Muslims.  Bad Camberg is just outside
Frankfurt, if I recall.  That is also near the U.S. military bases, so an
added safety.

The real danger is going over and getting "stuck."  I suspect the war will be
over by the time Bad Camberg comes around.  Besides, we will all PRAY for you,
ronnie, Daviid and who else.
