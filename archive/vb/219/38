Hi Curt,
That camber sounds like SOP to us.  The only time the rear tires are going to 
ride totally flat is if you have a load in it and/or a full camper kit.  KYB 
GR-2s came on our 1960 walk thru panel camper when we got it, and we 
installed KYB gas adjust shocks on our 1963 SC.  We do little to no 
off-roading and feel the stiffer shocks prevent the leaning of the bus/truck 
when taking twists and turns on those mountain pass roads, especially with a 
load on the roof rack or SC bed.
