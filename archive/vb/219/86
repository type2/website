Subject: Speaker Q

Hey Listees,
I am in the middle of reassembling, after painting my '66. The PO had a
stereo that I chose to reinstall. The 6" speakers were in the doors.
They actual ran the speaker wire through flexible metal conduit from the
body to the door. It looked like crap and sounded even worse when you
open the door. Any recommendations on what to use in place of the pretty
conduit? Or is there a better place to mount the speaker? It is a non
walk thru.
Thanks!
Tom
