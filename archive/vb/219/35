Congratulations! I have a SO42 as well, a '65 that I have had since '93. 
 I hope it (camper kit) is complete, as they are hard to find parts for although some can be "made". I have had to do that a few times. So I know some tricks. 
So, what color? Options?

Light travels faster than sound. 
This is why some people appear bright until you hear them 
speak.
