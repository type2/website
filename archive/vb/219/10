Define "really cambered in."

Chances are you're just seeing normal rear wheel camber at no-load.  These
busses have single joint (swing axle) IRS rear suspensions and have a lot
of camber change through their travel.

Grab a few friends and fill your rear and middle seats.  Roll the bus a
bit to let the suspension settle.  Now compare the camber to your no-load
camber.  Look better?

It will wear the tires, yes.  But so does any driving. :)  The
seemingly-excessive positive camber doesn't put as much edge-wear on the
tires as one would expect.

The 68-79 busses use the KG5530 shock, not the KG5529. Your mileage my
vary.

Personally I think the gas-a-just is to damn stiff for a split.  They work
well on a bay.  At least that's what my rear end is telling me after 20-30
some odd thousand miles. :)

Sure do!  Congrats.
