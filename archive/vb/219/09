That rumbling sound is normal for a bearing that needs to be replaced.

I reuse the big nut. I don't stake the edge into the notch when I put it 
back either, I use locktight. The upper inner bearing is no problem. 
Just pull the tube off the axle with the bearing in it, then knock the 
bearing out by hitting it from the inside with a long stick, like a 
broom handle. The big plug won't be a problem for you either. You have a 
welder, so you can do all the tricks like welding a nut to the plug to 
use with a slide hammer, or repairing any damage you might do to it 
while removing it.
