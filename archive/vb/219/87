Just a brief question to those of you going to Bad Camberg regarding
traveling overseas during this upcoming time of war/uncertainty.

The very nervous SO is starting to freak so I need some good calming
your nerves type responses to traveling over "there".  Now, I don't have
any qualms regarding the safety of traveling even if we are at war, but
she does.  Any suggestions to what I might say to help calm her down?

I'm going to check the US embassy's web site for travel recommendations
as well as some other .gov sites.  Suggestions?  How about travel
insurance?  Are people getting that?  Is it void in times of war?

Thanks!

Steve
