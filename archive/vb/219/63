Hi guys,
I'm absolutely fascinated by this pic and am very
interested to learn more about it.
I found it on thesamba.com and I contacted the guy
who'd submitted it to the gallery but he'd found while
surfing the net a while ago & forgot where.
Check it out:

If ANYONE can give me some info,either within
Australia or someone outside Australia who has it on
their website, I'd be interested to know its
whereabouts.
It's certainly got me stumped.
:o)
Cheers & God Bless
