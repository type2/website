Subject: Re: Keeps eating wheel bearings?

I've partially assembled another set of wheel bearings.  Turns out the bearings
are Chinese.  That could be a problem, but I doubt it is THE problem.

While installing the races, I could have sworn they were seated properly, but
I made a "test tool" out of a safety pin (made it into an 'L' shape) and discovered
that it wasn't seated all the way around.  Couple more wacks with the hammer
on the "seating tool" made from the old race, ground down to fit easily into
the drum.

I discovered that the threads on the spindle aren't great.  I have a thread
file and I will clean them up tonight.  Long term I've got to find another spindle
(from a '68 or '69) and new hex nuts are on their way.  Threads on the nut were't
much better.  I'll clean up both with the thread file and hope for the best
in the short term.

Couple questions:

Anyone know a source for a spindle, drivers side 68-69?
Anyone know a source for the locking nuts that use that allen bolt to tighten?
 Quite like that but mine seems to have a poor thread as well.

Thanks for any tips.

I'll assemble and drive tonight so I will be able to report the results tomorrow.
