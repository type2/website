Hi All -

I put KYB Gas-adjust fore and aft on my '61 pickup five years ago and would 
never be satisfied with anything less stiff.  Empty it's a teeny bit 
bouncy, but with any load not noticeable - and the increased handling 
capability with less roll makes these the ones for those of us driving the 
original Sports Truck.  Try it, for $120 or so you'll like it.
