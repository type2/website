a woman i know is going to bad camberg with a big canadian flag sewed to her backpack.  if your s.o. is worried about being seen as an ugly or hostile american, perhaps if she disguised herself a canadian she'd feel better about going.  the woman i know, soon to be canadian ;-) , is married to a vet so it's not so much about "i don't love my country" as it seems it's more "my country is doing things that i don't agree with."

i wish i were going to bad camberg.  i'd not worry because for some reason europeans think i'm german.  also saying that i'm a californian (as opposed to an american) doesn't seem to hurt none either....

In a new car, you're just going somewhere;                                
in a Volkswagen you ARE somewhere. -Stormy Henderson's Dad
