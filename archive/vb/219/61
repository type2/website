Subject: Abilene TX Show & Shine / Swap Meet

We are having a FREE  all VW event put on by the Abilene VW club on 26 April
At the new dragstrip right of I-20.
We have the local VW dealership sponsoring some things (Sterling VW) and are
working on getting the Texas VW Drag Racing Assn. to come join the fun. It
will be a somewhat informal event with lots of fun. So come on out for some
good 'ol VW festivities, Texas style!

Please spread the word...
