Subject: RE: [VB] Steering wheel cover?

USAF, got out in 77 myself. Ya, I sure would like to know the answer to
that question myself. My primary paint covering has worn away in all the
good hand hold areas and there is some primer underneath that gets tacky
when there is moist air around. Since I live in the Puget Sound area it
is moist most of the time!

What are folks using for steering wheel covers on the original Buses?
I' tried the flaps and all any are up to 16 inches.  Truck Stops sale
one for 22 inched wheels.  What you folks using them do for one?
