Subject: Re: [VB] How to clean out shift rod tube?

I worked on trying to make sure the shiftrod tube was cleared out. I 
ran into a major problem where the shiftrod was rusted to the tube. 
It's about 6 inches from the tube opening at the front of the bus.

I'm not sure what it is in there. Old metal from the shiftrod? Rust? 
Dirt? Grease? All of the above? Considering the shiftrod was 
basically "rust welded" to the tube, I don't think I'll be able to 
"bang" whatever it is loose. When I tried that with the rod it broke!

The shiftrod will go through that area fine...as long as the bushing 
isn't installed. But I wanna at least try  to fix this truck right 
and clear out the tube. I figure I'm gonna need some kind of bore or 
hone or cutter or something that is approx. 1 inch diameter and 
something I can put on the end of my drill with an extention of some 
kind. It'll need to be able to grind or cut away metal. It'll need to 
get at least 6 inches, more to be safe, into the tube. And of course, 
the cheaper the better.

Any ideas guys and gals?
