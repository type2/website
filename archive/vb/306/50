Yes, though generally bench seat buses came with full width middle seats, and 
walkthrough with 2/3 middle seats,   they did make some the other way round.  
I think there is an Mcode for it, but I don't remember it off hand.

and yes the floor plate location was different.  

and so the floor mats were different too.  And the bay floor mats have diff 
holes than splitties.  And the panel van floor mats have no seat mount or seat 
belt holes.

For what it's worth, I have a '63 15 window.  Here are the M-Codes:

- 424 - unknown, package?
- 081 - walk-through cab (microbus and deluxe - LHD)
- 114 - six opening side windows (export)
- 130 - microbus deluxe without sliding roof or roof windows

This Bus will not take a 2/3 middle bench - it lacks the necessary holes 
in both of the middle hold down plates that are welded to the floor 
(plates are there - no holes).  Plus, the original rubber mat does not 
have holes for a 2/3 bench's passenger side mounts.

I have had several people try to tell me that something is wrong with my 
Bus, that ALL walk-throughs came with 2/3 middle benches so you could
