Subject: How to clean out shift rod tube?

'59 Single Cab. Shift rod was rusted to tube. Used heat to get it loose.

Now I need to make sure the shift rod tube is cleaned out...remove
rust...old hardened grease....dirt/debris...whatever.

Can someone give me some suggestions on home-made tools and tips on how to
accomplish this. Thanks.
