Subject: new window seals, glue???

hi all, i just got my order in. i ordered my 2 front windshield seals and my rear window seal. my question is, is it ABSOLUTELY necessary for me to use window rubber glue for the seals? im going to just use these seals till i get enough money to get my bus painted, then im going to replace all of them again. so these are temporary seals. thanks in advance.
