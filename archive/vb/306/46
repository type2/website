Hi All,

On the topic of rust prevention: A friend of mine who specialises in
the restoration of mainly '60s Brit classics did me an ENORMOUS favour a
few years back. While my doublecab was resting at his place he put it up
on a lift, steamcleaned the hell out of the underside and then blasted
the entire underside with a product called Tectyl. This may not be
available outside of South Africa but it is apparently a close relative
to Waxoyl.

It starts thin and runny and eventually dries hard and waxy. A lot like
Cosmoline in appearance but not quite as thick. Five years or so on
there is not the slightest trace of rust on the underside of what was my
daily drive for most that time.
 
Well worth the effort and I'll definitely do it to any vehicle I intend
keeping.

Cheers

Michael
