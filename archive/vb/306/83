pitches.  Part# 18-618-100 and 18-618-150.



Hi all. I crossthreaded the fuel supply line nut onto the fuel tank. I am in
dire need of a die to fix the threads on the tank nipple before trying a
good nut. Anybody know the size I need and a supply source? Seems to be
about a
18mm fine thread but not sure. NAPA cant help and local hardware store no
help either. Thanks.
