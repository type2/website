Subject: Re: [VB] Aftermarket Shifters

 Bought a bus with a Berg Locker, after fixing the shift rail bushing it was 
a great shifter to use about half the throw of a stock shifter. When I sold 
the bus out the shifter came to go in my 63 bus and a stock shifter went in when 
the people that bought the old bus couldn't believe how far it was between 
gears, I sure didn't tell them what was in it before. Doug Lewis
