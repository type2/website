Subject: L-82 Silver White

Has anyone discovered a brand of rattle-can paint that's close to L-82
Silverwhite?

I just HATE paying $12-$14 per can plus shipping from Wolfsburg West.

I'm in So Cal, and here we have Lowes, Home Depot, Do-It Centers, plus local
stores.

If anyone can suggest a brand and what the color is called, I'd sure
appreciate it.

TIA,
Ed
