Subject: re:new windows seals

I would use tar as per eric & barb's suggestions...check the
archives...basically water can easily get in under the seal while driving in
the rain, then it will cause some rust that is difficult to repair around
the windshield, then it will be harder to get a decent seal there...then you
need more tar....etc etc....
