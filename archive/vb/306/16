Subject: Re: [VB] Steering wheel cover?

Me too.  I can get them at Schmuck's Auto supply.  The truck size fits the VW 
steering wheel (bug and bus).  Unfortunately I have found them only in black, 
no choice of colours like for the car size steering wheels.    

Gotta have a steering wheel cover.

I use the "old man" cheapo steering wheel covers. I call 'em that 
because both my grandpa's had 'em in their trucks all the time. 
They're the "leatherette" covers with little holes all in 'em that 
you put around the wheel then patiently wrap the vinyl cord around 
the whole thing and knot it when your done. They've beeen around 
forever and...to me...are the very comfy. I insist on using 'em in 
all my drivers...VW or not. Cost $1 at the Dollar General or maybe 
$4-$5 at Wal-Mart.
