Subject: Re: [VB] nosecone bushings

You could try using a tap and then a bolt (with spacer)  and turning the bolt 
to pull the bushing out.

This is how I remove starter bushings when teh engine is in the bus.

the bushings stop on "seats" inside the nosecone, and they each go in (and get
removed) from different ends. the VW service manual has a cross section view 
of this, and you can see the "seats" in the picture. <snip>

if you try to press them all the way through, you'll ruin the nosecone.
