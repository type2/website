Yah the ones all the places sell dont fit the bus nose cone, worthless. A local shop here in AZ
called 'Arizona transaxle' has them custom made and they sell them for like 10 bucks or so. Fit
perfect and look the same.

 The way i removed the 2 bushings last time was to take a platic rod that had a slightly mushroomed
end (from hammering on it before). I beat it down thru the hole and it shaved off any excess and was
tight enough that then it was able to grab onto the spacer and push it out. rinse, reverse, repeat.

sealant it's been leak-free since installation  as far as I can tell.
