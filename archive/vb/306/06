Greasy Folks,

Clara suggested a choke for heater control.  Ronnie F. sold me a choke
to use on my Eber . . . if I ever get the guts to try and do something
with it.  14 degree weather tends to give you the guts.  Low today was
14,  right now its 23, and predicted high is 26.  Haven't seen the sun
since Havasu BBB Sunday.

Curt
