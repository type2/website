Subject: Docproject back online, sorta

It's been a while since I was subbed to the list, so I wasn't sure if this
was appropriate "every day" material...so I waited for Friday.  And, hi
again :-)

The site at:

http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/

aka, "Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project", has been down for a
while.  I tried to find a free provider that offered the 600+ MB of space
needed to host the site in its current form and failed to do so -- but I
put it back online, albeit in a manner that isn't 100% straightforward.

http://failsure.net/media/oacdp/
The above location is not available M-F 0700-1800 Eastern time since it
sits on a T1 shared by a corporate network.

http://bfe.homelinux.net/oacdp/
The above location is not available at all times the the previous server
IS available, since it's my home internet connection...it'll be slow so
consider waiting for failsure.net to open up.

Summary: business hours on the east coast of the US, failsure.net is
unavailable.

Hopefully atlasta.net hosting will be available again soon, but this will
work in the meantime.  I had copies of all the files but the webpages
themselves are a bit outdated...I'll be cleaning those up later.

I'm announcing this here only. Feel free to tell others you think might be
interested though.
