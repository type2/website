Subject: Aussie Twin Cab progress

Happy new year all, 

Hope you all had a good one. Thought I'd post some progress pictures of 
Leo my trusty but crusty 62 twin cab... 

Last August I pulled the tray off Leo and the subfloor looked something like this

Been chipping away fabricating and welding and last week I got to the 
stage where I sprayed inside with rust bullet (although there's no rust left I guess I'm just anal...)

Fitted the tank from a fat chick ... 8-)

And got a tray back on last week. My dad the great stainless fab guru TedK would call the edge 'nicely hand formed and finished .... (did take 
a while to do...). Bare metalled the rear half and etched primed ...

Back to the day job after hols now which will slow progess down a bit.
If I could I  would like to thank some on this list for their help in getting Leo back
on the road.  
David Mayes is the caped crusader who helps me when I'm stuck
and need stuff out of the US, normally in a hurry after having tried other routes with no luck
(believe it or not it's not easy to get stuff sent here without paying an
absolute fortune for international freight - very few US vendors will send normal
US airmail).  Curt Conklin has muled stuff through customs and immigration
and into country for me (What's this in your luggage sir?  If you'll step into
this little room and take all your clothes off......), and Ronnie who was
kind enough to send me repro rear corners and a battery tray just before christmas
so I could actually make some progress over my holidays - thanks dudes!

Later All 

RobK
