Subject: Fuel tank outlet nipple size?

Hi all. I crossthreaded the fuel supply line nut onto the fuel tank. I am in 
dire need of a die to fix the threads on the tank nipple before trying a good 
nut. Anybody know the size I need and a supply source? Seems to be about a 
18mm fine thread but not sure. NAPA cant help and local hardware store no help 
either. Thanks.
