--Mike,

I have that distributor in my '65 bus.

I just put new points/condensor/cap/rotor on it this weekend. Parts from the Busboys, double check the numbers at oldvolkshome.com as suggested.

One gotcha: My rotor cracked at the bottom because it didn't fit on the distributor shaft. Too Tight. Same part number as the original I took off.
