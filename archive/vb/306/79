Subject: Re: [VB] 1951  t0 1967 speedometer cable 

The online parts manual says that a 1954 and earlier speedo cable is
different than a 1955 - 1967 cable. The earlier cable is 105mm longer. Maybe
because of the BD dash?

My 1967 Single cab, has a 1951 barndoor dash installed complete with the
1951 speedometer--I need to replace the speedo cable--Are they compatible?
If I buy a 1967 speedometer cable will it hook up to the 1951 speedo?,
