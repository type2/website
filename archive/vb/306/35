this won't work since the bushings stop on "seats"
inside the nosecone, and they each go in (and get
removed) from different ends. the VW service manual
has a cross section view of this, and you can see the
"seats" in the picture.
the inner bushing presses in and gets removed from the
inside (where the shift forks are). 
the outer gets pressed in and removed from the
outside. i hope that made sense.
if you try to press them all the way through, you'll
ruin the nosecone. 
however making a drift to press them IN works great (i
had one made).
i have had great luck with a round drift/punch that i
have made sure the side and tip are square to
eachother (as in not all chewed up at the end) to get
a good "grip" on the edge of the bushing when tapping
it with a hammer. be patient, they will come out.
VW specifies the following tools for the job: VW401
(press plate), VW412 punch, VW439 guide pin
(shouldered). VW410 is a punch.
