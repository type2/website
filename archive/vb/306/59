Subject: RE: [VB] 241 walk through

My 1960 15 window, non walkthrough, also takes a 2/3 seat. I learned the
hard way by buying, selling and trading off different years of middle seats
to get the correct 1960 deluxe middle seat to only find that it wouldn't
fit, only had the mounts for a 2/3 (still looking for a 1960 2/3 middle
seat)

My 65 Deluxe is not a walk thru but has mount points
for a 2/3 middle seat.  No apparent M code stating it
though.  

I ended up putting a full length seat in there though
because i could not locate a 2/3 for the life of me. 
I had extra mount plates so i welded them in.  now i
can accept both styles although my floor mat is only
for the full length set-up.

For what it's worth, I have a '63 15 window.  Here are
the M-Codes:

- 424 - unknown, package?
- 081 - walk-through cab (microbus and deluxe - LHD)
- 114 - six opening side windows (export)
- 130 - microbus deluxe without sliding roof or roof
windows

This Bus will not take a 2/3 middle bench - it lacks
the necessary 
holes 
in both of the middle hold down plates that are welded
to the floor 
(plates are there - no holes).  Plus, the original
rubber mat does not 
have holes for a 2/3 bench's passenger side mounts.

I have had several people try to tell me that
something is wrong with 
my 
Bus, that ALL walk-throughs came with 2/3 middle
benches so you could
