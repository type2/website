Subject: Re: [VB] Steering wheel cover?

Man! So that's what they're called! I got one of those for my bus in 1989.
That thing is still there and hardly shows any wear at all. I thought I had
just lucked up and found something that was both cheap and long lasting.
Good to see they are still being sold.

I use the "old man" cheapo steering wheel covers. I call 'em that
because both my grandpa's had 'em in their trucks all the time.
They're the "leatherette" covers with little holes all in 'em that
you put around the wheel then patiently wrap the vinyl cord around
the whole thing and knot it when your done. They've beeen around
forever and...to me...are the very comfy. I insist on using 'em in
all my drivers...VW or not. Cost $1 at the Dollar General or maybe
$4-$5 at Wal-Mart.

You can kind of see the one on my old Kombi in this picture. Not very
"cool" I guess, but very usable.
