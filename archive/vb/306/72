Hi Chris,
Gex = very bad quality in almost all of thier engine rebuilds!  You might 
give Butch at Bear's VW machine in San Diego a call at (619) 691-8385.  Ask about 
the 1641 SP with CW crank and oversized exhaust valves to help prevent valve 
heads from breaking off.  Been running this in our 1960 walk thru panel camper 
conversion with 3.875 R&P FF tranny for many years and now over 50,000 miles. 
 Getting 23-24 MPG (-at-) 3,000 RPM cruising in fourth gear at about 60MPH and 
keeping below 220F oil temp even in the summer.  Still running strong with no 
problems, except when we first got it, it had aftermarket too strong oil pressure 
relief spring (thank goodness for oil pressure gauge) and cleaning out all 
the casting flash in the heads and cylinder fins.  For more info about Butch try 
the archives and use his name in the search.
  As for wide five disc brakes try Wolfgang Int. in Redding CA, in your 
backyard practicly!
