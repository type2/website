Subject: Re: [VB] Rear splash guards

I wrote that to warn you and others so that if someone offers you repops that fit 5? to 67, they won't fit. 5?
to 66 will. But not 67. Sorry if I did not spell it out. I do not believe anyone makes 67 only splash guards.

> OK, but I only have a 67, so the question still stands, any repops being
made or what?
