Subject: RE: [VB] Rebuilt engines

I was also wondering about front disk brakes with the wide five lug pattern.

  Is anyone making them for type 2's?

If you are not in a hurry for wide five disc brakes, CB Performance is in
the developement stage on these. They will be a direct bolt on, front and/or
rears, early and/or late
