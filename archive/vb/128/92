Subject: RE: [VB] Wheel Powdercoating not a good thing?

We all can probably admit the fact that powdercoating, like chroming and
aluminum wheels, would have a lower coefficent of friction between the
face of the rim and the lugbolt(s). Many cars that come with factory
alum, require retorqing after a particular mileage. Also, the coating
itself may? Suffer compression upon intial torquing, and in effect
loosen after the layer is 'scratched' by the lugnut and hub, taking up
the small clearance of the total of the coating thickness(es, if done
both to face and back of rim).
This is truly a tragic story, for the injuries especially, the total
scare, and the loss Lind suffered...
