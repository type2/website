Subject: Ceramic choke coil insert--6v or 12v?

I was just at a VW show near Reading PA, spent some time checking out
the used parts vendors, when I spied a display of choke coils at one
stall.  The ceramic-bodied ones caught my eye, as the 30-PICT-1 in my 67
DC has had one since I bought it.  But the seller tells me, all ceramic
choke coils are 6v only, not 12v.

Was he right?  Has my 67 been using an incorrect voltage choke coil?
