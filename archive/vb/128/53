Hi Craig,
1955-60 had no fuel guage sender hole, 1961-67 did, 1967 had a hump top to 
reduce fuel from being pushed out due to the fuel turning to vapor inside the 
tank from the hot engine.  If your bus is going to be a daily driver and you 
are not restoring back to complete original, we would suggest installing a 15 
gallon 1968-71 bus gas tank.  Check out the DYI article on the 15 gallon tank 
installation Thom has on his website Vintagebus.com.
