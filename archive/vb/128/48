I am putting together a picnic at Cullen park (Saums near Barker Cypress) Anyone with a VW or VW interests is invited. Sunday June 30 meet at the exK-Mart Hwy 6 (-at-) Cairnway at 11am for a cruise to the park. The park has lots of tree cover and is a beautiful place for a picnic. BYOF (food) The have small BBQ pits or you can bring your own.

If you have any questions or need directions p-mail me. If any out-of-towners want to come down the night before, you can park at my house.



Thanks,

Brian
