You probably do, you just haven't found it yet.  They also tend to
get more F when there isn't a bunch of people stacked up at the
counter or a baseball game they'd rather be watching.  Ideally you
would go in on a weekday, early afternoon, when nobody else is in
the store and they are bored - then they are more likely to help.
Try to ask an older parts counter man if you can -- they tend to
know when the computer isn't going to help and when to go for the
paper catalog or just looking on the shelves. [0]

Greg's suggestion is also good:

KYB has a look-up by model but Toxic seems to cater to lowered
vehicles.  They list lengths at
http://www.toxicshocks.com/pages/lengths.html .  It looks like
their 413509, 13.6" extended, 9.3" compressed, loop/loop is about
the shortest one they have.

If nobody can get you a shock that's short enough, I guess you'll
have to put it back to stock height.  :)

[0] My parts counter story:
The headlight dimmer switch shorted out on the 1961 Pirsch fire engine
at the fire department.  It was the bog-standard type of floor dimmer
switch that everything used back then.  I took the old switch to Pep
Boys, set it on the counter, and said the famous, "Give me another'n
just 'zactly like this."
Young Counter Guy: What's this from?
 Me: It's not in your computer.  Just get me one like this.  It's a floor
     dimmer switch.
YCG: But we have to look it up in the computer.
 Me: OK.  1961 Pirsch fire engine.
YCG: 1961...Packard?
 Me: Pirsch.
YCG: We don't list that...uhhh...
Old Counter Guy comes over.
YCG: He needs a part for a 1961 Pirsch?
OCG: What do you need?
 Me: (holds up switch)
OCG: Oh, a dimmer switch.  Go get him a D100 and a D102...one of those
     is it.
YCG: Really?
OCG: Yeah.
The first one was an exact match for my old switch.
