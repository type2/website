Hello All, I'm new on the list...  I have to give it up, that Tipper is one of the coolest VW's I have never seen.  Major props on that!  

I have been into VW for over 10 yrs [since the age of 15], my last project was a 66' 11 Window Micro that I had to sell [1776cc split the tranny 2x], anywho I will soon be in the market for a 50-63 Type 2, or a 49-56 Type 1.  Probably a type 2, had a few bugs ya know... I loved my micro!  Very cool list, and I look forward to gaining much knowledge.  I stay in Deep South Texas, and learned about this group from a hyperlink on "The Samba."

- Peace Out
- Jose
