I'm having idle problems and was curious if anyone can help solve the
problem.
To start with I have a 1641 dual port, 041 heads, Engle 110 cam, stock
rockers, 009 dizzy at 10deg., AE case, 34-pict-3 carb, bosch super plugs,
etc....

I never had problems with a .009/34 PICT-3 with an Engle 110 if your vacuum
is OK. That's the first thing to check for. Also, make sure the .009 is set
for 28-30 degrees at 2800-3000 rpm. That's the correct setting for that
combination. You will still lope out a little with the cam being over 284
degrees duration, but an idle setting of around 1000 won't let it drop out
on you when you get hot.
