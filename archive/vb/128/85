Subject: Re: viruses/   look,my beautiful girl friend

I have been sent this virus 4 times now in the last week or two.   From what 
I understand, it takes two names from an infected computers mailing list, and 
sends itself to one, and says it is from another.   This time it said it was 
from hazetguy(-at-)earthlink.net (hazetguy).  So someone with both our address on 
their list is infected.   Each time, the from address has been someone on the 
vintagebus mailing list,  and it keeps sending around, which is why I am 
posting this here.

 I've also been sent viruses bearing email headers about bus list topics.    
had a good suggestion from Veewee111 to put three nonsense digits before the 
addresses, so you remove them before sending the mail, but the virus can't. 

So please do that if you have my email in your mailing list,  It'd be nice to 
get fewer viruses in the mail.

Be careful to not open attachments if you don't know for sure it was sent by 
a real human being.  And don't be offended if you send me an atttachment and 
I ask you if a real person sent it.
