Subject: North Carolina to DFW, Texas anyone?

Would there happen to be anyone traveling from the east side of North
Carolina to Fort Worth, Texas in the next month or two? I'd like to find
someone who would transport a full length bus roof rack on your roof or
trailer or somehow. It's likely to scratch your roof where the feet and
clamps go, so if you have a very nice bus or paint job, you might not
want to do it. But if your bus is like mine, I'll let you choose from my
fine selection of krylon to touch it up : )  I'll pay $100 in small
unmarked bills upon safe arrival to Fort Worth, Texas. This should cover
your gas and a few happy meals between here and there ( about 1000 miles
)  
Thanks, Chris
