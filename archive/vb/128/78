Subject: Looking for some sheet metal quick.  Can you help?  

Anyone have a bus they are cutting up or old sheet
metal pieces they are not going to use?  I am looking
for the following by the begining of July.

Front floor, both sides
Outer lower nose skin.  (from crimp up about 5")
Outer nose crimp plate (behind bumper with square
holes)
Rocker skin, either side.
Rear heater tube cross brace

I know i can get these from WW as a last resort. 
Kelly (Metalwizzard) is not sure he can get me the
parts in time.  I am on a tight budget an was hopeing
to find an alternate source.

Also need a 61/63 front drivers door.
Have safari window parts & old VW mag's to trade or
good old cash.

Thanks for the help.
Matthew
