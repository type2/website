 Hi Volks,
 As far as we have observed VW or there supplier of rims primered, and 
painted 
 them semi-gloss black.  Then the outer surface of the rim which is most 
 visable they color painted the rim.  This resulted in some overspray onto 
the 
 semi-gloss black especially on the innered side of the rim through the rim 
 slots.

A comment on the spraying of white- often the area where the lug nuts went is 
still black ( with some over sprayed white)- seems VW just made sure they 
covered the area visible between the hubcap and the tire.  Ya the area the 
tire sits on is black
