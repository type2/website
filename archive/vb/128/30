Hi everyone,
I'm having idle problems and was curious if anyone can help solve the =
problem.
To start with I have a 1641 dual port, 041 heads, Engle 110 cam, stock =
rockers, 009 dizzy at 10deg., AE case, 34-pict-3 carb, bosch super =
plugs, etc....
I used to have dual 40mm Dells on the engine and it ran and idled =
perfect. I switched to a stock top-end but now it won't idle. I'm sure =
it has something to do with the cam's lift matched up to the stock carb, =
but just curious if anyone's ran into this problem and how to correctly =
solve it.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Dave Barnes
