Subject: RE: [VB] Single wheel trailer Q's

Damn, wish I had a FLAPS around here. 

I'm still struggling to come up with a shock for my slam-o-matic that is
short enough. All the local stores keep asking for an application. I
take the bug lowering shocks with me and say "I need something about 2
in shorter than this" and they ask "what's it for". I'm really tempted
to tell them "Your mom" but know that won't go anywhere good. The
concept of digging through a few boxes is _completely_ alien to anyone
and the standard bus shock is (obviously) about 16". Grrr...

Frustrated, but still looking. Anybody know if old Mini shocks are very
short?

Take the ones you have out and take them to your FLAPS on a slow day.
They can probably fix you up with some that will work.  Just have them
look in their paper bearing catalog - the trailer won't be listed in
their computer.
