I saw the pics when ronnie brought that beast home and really didn't get an 
appreciation for it until I saw it close up Saturday.  If you look REAL 
close in the photo, you can see the aircraft style rivet job for the 
rear.  Looks like they may even be stainless rivets.  The entire beast has 
a feeling to it of, how shall I say.....  "sheer insanity", but one that 
only its creator could love.  The Franken reference could not be 
better.  Absolutely perfect.
