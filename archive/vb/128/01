Subject: RE: [VB] Wood slats on every row???

I know not much more about this stuff beyond what I learned following the 
links.  That being said...

Interstate Plastics recommended against the use of UHMW for outdoor UV 
exposed applications and suggested IPX material instead.

But....
If you were to use it, it sounds like a killer material for a bed slat 
application.  Only possible problem would be that your bed would be so 
slick that your load would be sliding around all over the place.  Some tie 
downs would solve that problem.

 From some of the prices that I've been able to find, it looks very 
reasonable for a bed slat application.  Maybe we can get some mfgr to make 
some up with the contours of the original slats (wishful thinking)
