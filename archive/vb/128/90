Subject: Wheel Powdercoating not a good thing?


From Lind Bjornsen's tragic bus trip story:

"...the postmortem analysis of the wreck showed that the rear left wheel came off of the vehicle.  I believe that this was due to the powdercoating
 on the wheels caused the lug bolt to lose torque some 4000 miles after the wheels lug bolts had been properly torqued on.   when the wheel
 came off, the bus pulled to the left.  the right rear tire was scrubbed off of the rim and the rim dug into the asphalt.  the cloud of dust that Sean
 saw was pulverized rock from the pavement. the bus then hit hard on the passenger side and rolled two and one quarter times.  it finally cane to
 rest pointing back toward the direction the we came from in the southbound lane (we had been heading northbound). "

Check that torque!
