Subject: RE: [VB] Correct Rim primer?

Hi Volks,
As far as we have observed VW or there supplier of rims primered, and painted 
them semi-gloss black.  Then the outer surface of the rim which is most 
visable they color painted the rim.  This resulted in some overspray onto the 
semi-gloss black especially on the innered side of the rim through the rim 
slots.
