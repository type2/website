Subject: RE: [VB] bus painting (hippy style) question

Matt,

There is a member of SV2's in San Diego that brings a vehicle to each
show he attends for the kids to paint. He washes it off afterward to use
again, but might be able to provide some good insight. Not sure if he's
on here or not, but the club URL is: http://www.sv2s.com

Good luck with the buses and the girls!
