Subject: RE: [VB] bus painting (hippy style) question

Matt,
  We've painted buses with tempera paint, the dry powder 
you mix with water, for a local Mardi Gras parade. It 
washes off pretty good. Some premixed paints are tougher 
to remove though. I found the powder at a teacher's 
supply store.  Search "Houck" on www.vintagebus.com 
gallery for before and after pics of my 21w.
