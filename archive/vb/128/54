Okay, I scored a very clean bay window gas tank at Sacto BOR, to put in =
my 64 bus, and have seen the website that shows the filler neck mods to =
put it in, but as far as the gas gauge goes, do any of you know if the =
bay window sender will work with a splitty gauge?  I know the 6v splitty =
fuel stuff works with 12v just fine, but are the ohm's just way out of =
range on the 'newer' sender to work with the older gauge?

I was going to check with my ohmmeter when I got the tanks out, but =
thought maybe I could save some time if someone here knows for sure or =
not.

Thanks for any help!
