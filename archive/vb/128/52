Subject: Gas Tank Replacement

Greets, vaunted bus list:

I ordered a replacement tank for my '67 Sondermodel from Wolfsburg West and
under Type 2 bus gas tanks the description reads: "1955-1967."

Wow. There were no changes in design to the bus gas tank between 1955 and
1967?

Or do replacements by nature embody some generic one-deal-fits-all? Just
curious.

Thanks.

Craig
