Subject: Re: [VB] Wheel Powdercoating not a good thing?

On my old 67 westy the passenger rear would loosen up to the point that it
would start sounding like a flat. Scary in traffic. I eventually replaced
the wheel, drum, and lug bolts with those from a parts bus and it never
happened again. Other than that I've never even found one loose. I don't
torque them to spec. I do stand on the breaker bar but no measurement. I
figured a fat man bouncing had to be just about right. maybe this should be
the new standard?
