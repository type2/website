Subject: Oil Survey?

Since its come up again (again and again) maybe Im interested in how many
people are using synthetic now. I suppose it could evolve into an overall
oil survey.

PMAIL ME. DO NOT POST THE REPLIES TO THE LIST.

Ill parse the results and post them in say....2 weeks? How about the 28th
last Fri in June?

Survey.
-Engine Year, Displ.
-Oil Type and weight
-Oil temp and or pressure Idle and 55-60 (xway) (when fully warm only)
-Anything special that you think is important.


Im probably going to regret this.
