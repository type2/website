Subject: RE: [T2] New MicroBus [and the Wall Street Journal]


I'd like to see the WSJ do an in-depth report about the VW0A trademark/copyright mess, how it is affecting VW-related businesses, owners of older VW vehicles, etc., etc., etc.

Heck, at this stage of the game I'd be happy to see such an article in People magazine or the National Enquirer...
