Hey Charles,
I had the same prob on a 1600 dp. It turned out that
the head on 3 & 4 side had become loose. Pulled the
engine, retorqued, and it fired properly again, but
the head bolts kept backing off. That's a whole other
story, but just wanted to let ya know that was the
problem with mine, head was loose and sucking air.
