Subject: RE: [VB] Volkswagen OK's New Microbus

  Since they're going to be made in Hannover, maybe the 
quality will be better than the new beetle, which is 
made in Puebla Mexico. 
  As for "Comfort of a Limousine"? We don't need no 
steek'n comfort! I wanna hunch over my big 'ol steering 
that is to the right of the drivers seat in order to see 
out the window for the 5 hour drive home from the 
classic!

some progressions I've observed:
knee nocker  ->  air bags
reserve switch ->  gas guage w/idiot light
aircooled motor -> refrigerated passengers
Classic, art-deco lines ->Craptacular, focus-group design

Baby back ribs -> McRib

'00 turbonium

Volkswagen says the Microbus, due out late in 2004 as a 
2005 model, will create a new segment – “a MPV (minivan) 
combining striking design and high functionality with 
the comfort of a limousine”.
