I have restored three 67 westies and have bought all the rubber from 
Wolfburgwest and have been quite happy with the quality.  I tried Bus Depot 
on the first bus and it was a disaster.  They sent me a small rear window 
seal when I clearly specified a 67.  They sent the wrong window rubber 
peices, too many of one not enough of another, etc.  They backordered some 
window peices that I recieved over SIX MONTHS late, well after the bus was 
finished.  They also managed to lose and not reimburse a money order for 69 
dollars.
Wolfsburg on the other hand has always sent exactly what I ordered and has 
on several occassions suggested corrections I needed to make in my order, 
such as correct seat color material and other items.  They really seem to 
know their busses.
