All,

I checked the '67 DC's headliner this morning and can confirm that both
the back strip and the two shorter strips (either side of the roof air
vent) are made of thick cardboard.

I believe that Mike's tail-lights are correct for the model, I can't
confirm (perhaps if he's lurking on this list, either he or Fig can
answer) if those are the original lenses or whether they have been made
to match the originals.

Regards
James
