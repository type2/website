Hi,

Here's my [long] story.

I ordered a Transform transmission like 20 years ago or something. I 
had it shipped to a local shop. (This was before the Freeway Flier 
model, so I just ordered a lower fourth gear with it.)

When they got the transmission, the shop owner went ballistic. He 
called Transform and chewed them out for selling me a center section 
and not making me buy other parts that he thought were crucial to 
ensuring the longevity of the transmission - such as mounts, nose cone, 
reduction and shaft bearings, etc. He even wanted to see new clutch, 
pressure plate, throwout bearings.

So, while I was in the shop listening to him rant - he put me on the 
phone with them (I think it was Larry?) and the guy (-at-) Transform said, 
"What a jerk, are you sure this guy is OK?" I said that he was only 
looking out for me and wanted to make sure that everything was going to 
go in once and not have to come out several months down the road.

Larry said, "What kind of bus is that?" I told him, and he said, "Do 
you want to sell your sliding roof to me? I'll pay you good money for 
it." Uh, no. But thanks for the offer. That was weird...weren't we 
talking about transmissions?

Anyways, I had to agree with the shop owner to go down a list of parts 
that he would not be responsible for, their failure symptoms, etc. 
before he would even touch the transmission. It went in OK, and seemed 
to work out well for me despite my driving habits during those early 
years.

Conrad
