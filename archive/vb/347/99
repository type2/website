WD 40 works well too!  Be careful using a razor blade.  Your glass can
scratch.  We just took some holiday stickers off our sliding glass doors
in our house.  We have tinting to help keep the house cool.  I took a
plastic scraper that came with some non-stick pots we bought many years
ago.  It was perfect for getting the sticky stuff off without damaging
the tint.  I understand you took your tint off but you still want to be
careful with the glass.  The tint places down here in Florida use
ammonia when they are removing tint in order to replace it.  They also
advise not to use window cleaner with ammonia when cleaning tinted
windows.  You can give that a try.  So, my recommendation in the order I
would try is:

Goo Gone
WD 40
Window cleaner with ammonia. (perhaps use this as a final clean up)

With all of these I would use a plastic scraper.  You can pick them up
at auto parts stores too.  They are used for spreading bondo.
