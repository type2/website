Hi,

You're going to have to figure out the safest, fastest speed to drive 
your bus. This takes some time and patience.

For my bus, 62 mph came up as a sweet spot. Though I can tell you that 
I-35 is no place to be (-at-) 62, or anything less than 70 for that matter. 
Secondary roads are much better. Pulling over on the shoulder helps - 
and gets waves of gratitude around here.

I'm not much of a fan of pulling over, but it beats having Bubba doing 
the blow-by.

If you have the opportunity to buy "75" profile tires, that helped me a 
great deal. I'd start there.

Happy New Year!

Conrad
