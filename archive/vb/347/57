Subject: flat 4 GT wheel with GT horn button removal

We removed the button with out damage. Thought we would post for the
archives if anyone needs the information later.

The horn button was friction held, not snapped in a groove or detent.
The spring you see is only to proved a outward force on the 4 plastic
legs to increase their friction. The bossing has a lip on it that does
not allow you to pry on the outer rim of the button (see pics on the 
Samba under toyfield or Parts/Accessories - Other 
<http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/album_cat.php?cat_id=43>).

Solution was to use a thin piece of flexible steel, we use a street
sweeper brush bristle (you can find them in the street - a very handy
tool for digging, scraping and now horn button removal.) Philip
inserted the metal between the movable inner center piece (blue) and the
outer plastic ring (black.) See the arrow in the picture. By
depressing one side of the inner button, he was able to get enough room
to insert the metal at an angle toward the outside. Then he rotated the
metal toward vertical (perpendicular to the horn button) and this gave
enough tension to overcome the friction and pull out the button assembly.

We have posted pics on the Samba.
