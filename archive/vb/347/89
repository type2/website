Subject: Web pages updated for january and more

OK First update of the year is up and things are a bit different. Jan 05 we
now have an archive of past pages from 2000 to 2004 (well minus 2003 which
is being a PIA) so I'll have to fix it later. Parts pages are up under a new
style, but I still have to get the pricing info squared away. I hope to have
all this done by next month, if I can get the time. Be sure and read the
notes for the archive section, and the parts pages they open different from
before. Enjoy and let me know what ya'll think. The pages for jan have pics
of the new stamping deal we are working on for the undercargo floor belly
pans, I also would like imput on those as well. Later and enjoy,

PS Mark Dearing I don't have the key for Dolan's BTW. Send me some pics when
its done, I might be able to send more to them after I finish them.
