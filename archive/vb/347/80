If the material is plastic, they try heating it up a bit
with a hot air popcorn machine, or a hair dryer, or
heat gun to soften it up a bit and maybe it will
peel off by hand.

The chemicals only will work at the interface
between the material and glass (where the sticky
stuff is) and applying it to the surface of the stuff
may not get through to the adhesive.

Jeff  - who struggled for a half hour with chemicals
on a vinyl bumper sticker until I used a hot air
popcorn machine which allowed me to take it off
in about one minute.
