Buy new ones? TMI makes a decent repro.

Usually when they start swinging out on thier own, it's the plastic part
that the metal rod of the visor pivots in is cracked. You can try to glue it
back together, but I think it would be futile. If the visor is just flopping
downward, there should be a phillips screw you can tighten to increase the
resistance to move. You can see the screw if you pull the visor downward.
