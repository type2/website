Subject: phoenix to havasu - routes?

i am assuming that most folk run I-10 to 95 and up the colorado, but 
are there any suggested back roads? my detail map shows a few dashed 
RED lines crossing the mountains from, say, 60, but dashed few BROWN 
ones, dashed or undashed! while i did take a forest road behind 
woodchute mtn back home from jerome, i wasn't very far from towns 
along that route. last thing i'd want to do is break something major 
in the buckskins!
