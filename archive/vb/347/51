Forget the "Freeway Flyer" from Transform, it is low quality and the
service is terrible.  I had on that failed in less than 4000 miles and
they would do nothing to help me.

Cecil,

Thank you and all that responded with input on my question about raising my top end speed. As usual, I received excellent information.
