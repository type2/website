You can adapt a bay window mechanism to fit a splitty. Find the assembly, 69-79, 
don't mess with the one year only '68. The motor shaft is perpendicular to the 
windshields and doesn't physically fit in the nose. Find a bug wiper assembly 
with a right-angle gear and fit that on the bay mechanism. You will have to 
deform the defroster tubes a bit to make it fit in. I used a large screwdriver 
and a mallet to make room, it doesn't take much. 

Choose one of the three speeds if you use the stock switch, or mount the bay 
switch somewhere. It's not stock, but it works well. 

Also, Mike Basso at www.thingsunlimited.net makes a heavy duty set of wipers for Things with the set screw mount that should mount on splitty arms. I haven't tried them on a bus, but they could work.
