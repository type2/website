Subject: Re: sun visors

When i was working on my 65 i found the same problem
with the new sun visors.  Seamed to me that it was the
mount bracket that was the problem, not the actual
visor.

What i did was take the mount brackets from my old OG
visors and stripped off the old sunvisor.  I cleaned
up the base and arms and then I adapted it so that the
OG mount bracket would go into the TMI new sunvisor
pad.  I think you have to grind off a tab or something
like that.  Worked great.  3+ years and no problems. 
(Although my bus is a garage queen so with daily use
it may not hold up as well)

Anyway, that is what i did to solve that problem.
