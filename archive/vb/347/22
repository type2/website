I think it's more the door frame that's the "standard" part, though don't 
early RHD cargo doors have the handle on the rear door, too, Rob?

The RHD Bay Double cabs have "normal" left side rear doors, and I THINK that 
the post '64 RHD DCs had "normal" rear doors, but I can't be certain of 
that.

I know that my idea of welding the "spare" rear door frame into the driver's 
(right) side of Yeti would result in a suicide door on the driver's  side.

FWIW.
