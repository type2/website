Subject: Breather nut removal

Stupid noobie question, but isn't there a better tool to remove the nut that
lives inside the oil breather(it holds it to the breather/gen. stand)?  The
tool I have (small dog ear-like socket) just does not cut it.  The notches in
the nut are so shallow that I can't put ANY torque on the damn thing.

Any other way to get that thing off??

TIA

Steve
