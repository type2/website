My RHD 67 DC has the cardboard strips for all spots, but i am unsure if they 
are original as they have been brush painted so i cant see the texture. I 
will know more when i strip them down.

As far as rhd binz's, i do not know of any and have never seen one, but i 
would guess a rhd binz with cargo door on left would also been suicide since 
the door was handmade to be suicide on purpose instead of out of necessity 
for cheaper parts like VW. Binz was in 'taxi' mode as they were droing that 
for alot of other vehicles with suicide doors. Also note that when binz 
changed to the normal door in 59 they still used the same sucide door with 
the inner handle towards the front, but put the hinges on the opposite side 
and moved the outer handle towards the back.
