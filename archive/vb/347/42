If you use Rain-X, and you use a rag or towel or something to apply it
or clean it off the body, make sure to toss the rag or towel when you're
done.  A friend in high-school re-used a Rain-X rag and got Rain-X on
the _inside_ of his windshield, where it proved remarkably tough to
remove - he tried dish soap, Windex, alcohol, and a Zippo lighter
without much success.
