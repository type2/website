Subject: Re: [VB] Rubber seals & sheet metal for a 67 waste

Hi Clark,
If you want good sheet metal we would suggest going with 
http://www.metwiz.com/  and also trying out the archives.
  As for seals, you have to keep in mind that the VW parts market is very cut 
throat, with always someone desperate enough to sell a little cheaper, and as 
the price goes cheaper, so often can the parts.  On the other hand just going 
by who sells for the highest price is not the way to go either.  It is much 
better to look and demand for quality parts as you have already found out with 
that junk floor piece.
  Again hitting the archives will inform you with vast amounts of info, and 
checking out venders like Ronnie (-at-) http://www.oldvolks.com/, or Bus Depot (-at-)
