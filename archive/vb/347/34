Subject: True Canadian Winter Bus Campout

Hi Volks,

It may be cold and snowy outside, but there are lots of people who 
still want to go camping. This email is just a reminder that it's only 
6 weeks and counting until the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout.

Who:
You and your bus. Splitties, Bays, Vanagons and EuroVans are welcome. 
And their owners.

Where:
Valens Conservation Area, near Hamilton, Ontario Canada. About an hour 
from Toronto.

When :
February 19-20th, 2005.  Brrrrr.

What's up:
Saturday we'll start to gather at 1 PM. Once the fire is lit, those who 
are interested can head off for a hike to the fire tower, or if the 
conditions are good we will be able to go XC Skiing or snowshoeing.  Or 
you can try your hand at Ice Fishing. Dinner will be served at about 
6:00 PM, and then we'll settle around the campfire for conversation, 
tunes and good cheer. Sunday we'll start to get the Breakfast Burritos 
going at about 8AM, and after breakfast we'll head out for a Scenic 
Tour of a few of the waterfalls in the area.

Cost:
$12/person for the group meal plan. $26/night for a hydro campsite, 
$7/night per additional vehicle. Campsite reservations are not 
required, please let me know if you're coming, particularly if you're 
wanting to join in on the group menu.

Weather Conditions:
It'll be winter. Ice cold at night, so bring a heater and lots of 
blankets. And wooly long underwear. And a toque.

Website:
There is lots of info, menu details and links to pics and trips reports 
here:

Happy trails,
