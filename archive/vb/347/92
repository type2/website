Hi Again,

I bought a driver's side floor piece.  The vendor is well advertised and has
the best website so ordering was easy. Plus they offer discounts now and
then...

The floor section I received does not have the same stamping pattern as the
original floor which is disappointing.  It will be the only giveaway that my
installation isn't factory.

Are all the floor pieces made by the same supplier and just the vendor
prices different, or is there a preferred vendor for original sheet metal
quality?

Will anybody but me notice that the panel is different?  Do I need a shrink?

Thanks again.

Clark
