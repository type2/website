There is also a screw (under a plastic cover) at the top of the shaft of the
visor (in the mount).  There is a spring under that.  I have had decent
results tightening that screw.  If the mount is cracked, remove the screw,
spring, and shaft...THEN glue it with something cool (I favor Duco), and put
it back together later (like tomorrow).

Has worked for me.
