I use standard 11" trico blades on Honda Accord wiper arms that I cut and
modified to fit the original wiper arm bracket (the spring-loaded part
that clamps to the wiper shaft).   They're cheap, ugly, and work
great.  Plus, it's easy to revert to the original parts and
functionality just by undoing the two set screws in the bracket and
swapping the Honda arms for the original SWF ones.

This is on my '66, I don't know if '67 is different.
