Subject: flat 4 GT horn button removal

Hi we have the flat 4 GT wheel with GT horn button.  The wheel and shaft 
are out of the bug (sorry it not on a bus but we can think about putting 
on a bus) but we still can not see how to remove the horn button and we 
do not want to damage the button. Can you help, maybe a drawing or pic., 
web page?
Needed new steering box now trying to make the horn button functional.
Thanks for any help.
