Subject: New Bus owner with decklifd question

Hey all, I just purchased a '65 standard with a
factory sunroof and will be restoring it this summer
to its former glory. One thing I am wondering is how
can you tell if you have the correct year decklid and
rear hatch? Mine have clearly been replaced with looks
like NOS units as they are factory primered on the
inside and painted to match on the outside. But I am
not sure if they are the correct year. Obviously they
are not off of a barn door or pre-64, but how do I
know if they are split Bus or Bay window? Are they
interchangable??
