Subject: reduction boxes

i also suffer from the same problem--i understand it 2 ways
either 1-install a freeway flier transmission--about600 plus price of
swapping--or 2-(if you're interested in lowering the bus)gather up type 3
axles-type 3 backing plates--the axles are longer & the bus backing plates
wont go with the axles-
there is also a IRS conversion kit which will eliminate the
boxes as well--not sure on$ for either --with the  type 3 axles-you need the
axle tubes as well--plus "flopping" the
ring & pinion gears?(the tranny runs"backwards" and the redux boxes make the
wheels run the correct direction)
i read in hot vws that berg enterprises offers a 5th gear tranny-but noy sure
if theres one for a bus--BIG BUCKS
i think when i get ready($) to do mine--i'm going with the freeway flier from
either transform or rancho.shipping's gonna kill me (from cali to orlando) my
1835cc helps keep the speed up i can cruise to the beach (1 hour)(-at-)55-60 mph--
no problems..good luck
