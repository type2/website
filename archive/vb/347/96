I know we all torment ourselves over questions like this. Maybe we all
should have shrinks! I think it depends on whether you want function
or correctness, and if you want correctness are you willing to put
yourself through the hassles of locating a better supplier and
returning the one you got.

 The floor section I received does not have the same stamping pattern as the
 original floor which is disappointing.  It will be the only giveaway that my
 installation isn't factory.
 
 Are all the floor pieces made by the same supplier and just the vendor
 prices different, or is there a preferred vendor for original sheet metal
 quality?
 
 Will anybody but me notice that the panel is different?  Do I need a shrink?
