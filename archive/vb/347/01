Hi SLOJason,
Yes you can get a tranny rebuilt with 3.875 or 3.44 ring and pinion and  
small changes in the 2-4th bus gearing.

Rebuilding the tranny center section is.  Assembling the axles and  putting 
the entire tranny is what you can do.
 

Is  there a stock part that can be bought and installed? Is it big  $$$?


Yes, both R&Ps are later stock and the gearing we are using with  our 3.875 
R&P FF tranny is stock from different years and models.  As  for cost it 
depends on what you call big $$$.  some volks we know have  problems spending more 
than a $100.00 a year on their bus.
  Check the archives on Freeway Flier Tranny and if you Pmail us we  are 
happy to send you or anyone else a copy of our "Modified Tranny  History" of our 
experience of tranny gearing.
