Subject: wipers

It's been raining cats and dogs here.  I'm looking for
the best wipers, arms and blades, for my 67 Westy. 
The stock ones are not availible locally.  I presently
have some kind of adapter on the drivers side which
mounts an  arm assy of some kind with a joint in it to
adjust the angle of the blade.  It's a splined collar
with a couple set screws in it.  The arm assy fits
over the spines.  The passengers side has the stock
assy. but the blade is shot and just chatters across
the windshield. 

Is there another wiper assy from a later model vw that
works on the 67 bus?  What works the best for a 67
Westy?

Thanks for the help.  Stay dry...

John
