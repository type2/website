When I lived on the wet side for a while, I grew to love rainx.  The key
is to apply to a really clean dry window, not the easiest at road side
in pouring rain :-)

Thanks to all for the advice on replacement wipers for
my 67 Westy.  I'll try the Rain X too.  I had never
heard of that stuff.  Thanks...
