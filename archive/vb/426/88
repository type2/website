LOL!.  Great story!

-Reminds moi of my then 15 YO & I flying in to Portland, OR  in 1998 to pick
up a 63 DC that we were going to renovate for him to drive when he got his
license.  2 engine fires & a 500 mile tow job on a dolly behind a 26'  empty
U-Haul truck back home & we were set to roll!  Not!  $2k later the DC was
licensed & driveable & he could drive it to school.  Despite volks leaving
notes on it to see if it was for sale, & his friends thinking it was the
coolest thing they had ever seen, it was cold in the winter, slow in the
Mountains of Utah, & he wanted a BMW instead!   WTF, I said, I took it over,
still have it today, & make the Tilts for VW trucks all over the globe, & he
is now 26 1/2 & w/o a car at all, after the BMW he had died & he has never
replaced it, but commutes betwen NYC & SFO where cars are an expensive pain to
own.

YMMV,

Mr. BZ-oh, to be as smart as a 15 yo & know what I know now
