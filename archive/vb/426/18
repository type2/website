Subject: Big Wednesday pics

Hi,
Anyone interested, I posted pics from the 8/11/2010 Big Wednesday on
PhotoBucket.
Location: San Onofre Beach, California. Surf was mediocre. Sun was shining. I
wasn't at work. We caravaned 3 buses from Torrance. Took about an hour and
twenty cruising around 55. Took Pacific Coast Hiway on the return. 3 hours of
stop lights and a stop at In-N-Out.
