Subject: Re: [VB] Steering *clunk*

Hey Tom,

As you said, get under the bus and do a visual while someone is turning the 
wheel for you. If possible do this while the bus is moving. You may be able 
to rig a sling or something underneath so you don't have hang on and drag 
your heals. :-)

I have a budding problem with my '67 that I'm hoping isn't what I think it 
is (a bad steering box).

Basic behavior is that when I turn the steering wheel under load, it gets 
harder to turn, then there's a slightly audible *clunk* as the steering 
wheel moves abruptly (if only slightly).  If you continue to turn the wheel 
in the same direction, it will happen again.

The result is that the bus doesn't turn even as you're turning the wheel, 
then it turns abruptly, if just a bit (but enough to be dangerous).

Again, this appears to only happen under load - i.e. while moving.  When I'm 
parked (or moving very slowly, I believe) the wheel turns freely and 
normally.

Its at the point where I don't really feel like she's safe to drive (says 
the guy who drove her the 9 miles into work this morning), but I'm not 
really sure what's up.

Full disclosure: I haven't gotten under the bus to do a visual yet, or 
pulled the belly pan. Steering damper was replaced at some point in the last 
few years.
Any thoughts?

Cheers,
  Tom
