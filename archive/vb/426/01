Subject: Reduction box half removal

I seem to have hit a brick wall.  I removed all the 13MM bolts from the RDG
half and the piece is loose but won't come off. Comes out about an inch but no
further.  Is there anything holding the gear/bearing on the main axel shaft??
Does the main axel have to be removed also?

Driving me nuts.
