Subject: Re: [VB] Tight Steering (was: Re: [VB] Steering *clunk*)

I've made that adjustment, not difficult. Just jack up the front end so both 
tires are off the ground so that you can "feel" the adjustment progress. If 
you can't find any other reason for the symptoms you described, I would back 
out the bolt about 1/16 turn and see if that helps.

Thanks Chris.

I was recently reading Bob Hoover's TLUZ notes on Steering, Alignment, etc. 
while
trying to better inform myself on what might be going on and I've taken his
advice with a good deal of weight:

"See that bolt? [...] LEAVE IT THE (*#$ ALONE!"
     - Bob Hoover (paraphrased, caps may have been added by me)

I figure I'll take the time to get the steering "not tight by default" 
before
I even consider adjusting that bolt.  :)

thanks for confirming this is the way to go...

cheers,
  tom
