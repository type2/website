Isaac,

The single port may explain why you can't speed on the highway. The dual 
ports and larger carbs will do the trick for you. Also if you are running a 
stock exhaust, that will also limit your top end. Are you running a speed 
limiting rotor on your dizzy?

Sorry, can't help with the gasket kits.
Did you post on type2.com? There is a lot more action over there.

I am currently running a 1600 SP w/ 30pict Solex... I am upgrading it to a 
Dual Port Dual Baby Webers so maybe that will help... In the interest of 
saving money I may hod off on the Trans and see if the upgraded engine would 
help.

On a side note I am having a hard time finding a gasket/rebuild kit for my 
Baby Webers anyone got any ideas?
