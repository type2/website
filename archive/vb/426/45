Subject: FS: Rebuilt 1600 d/p heads, case (not mine)

A friend of mine has a pair of complete rebuilt dual-port heads and a 1600
dual port case that he bought for his dune buggy and never used. He says
he'll take any reasonable offer, as they're just taking up space in his
garage. He's near Ithaca, NY, but can also bring them to Buses By The Depot
here in PA on Oct. 2 or can ship.

Contact him, not me ... Ian  ... Maggiepaigeh (at) hotmail.com
