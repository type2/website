E&B have a good point about the gears. Its usually best to go with a 3.88 
ring and pinion rather than the stock 4.125 and avoid changing the 
individual gears.

Hi Isaac,
You should check out what RPMs you are doing in each forward gear.
Have a passenger write down at what MPH you hit 1,500 and 3,000 RPM in
2-4th, and where 3,000 RPM in first.

If you do go with a higher fourth gear you need to have the other three
gears changed so you do not end up with a huge RPM gap between third
and fourth gears.
