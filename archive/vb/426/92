Huntington Beach High School.  Huntington Beach, CA
Sunday October 24. 7:00 AM (usually people there before dawn)  until....

The raffle usually has a large number of great prizes.
Karl (rest his soul) and Harry used to win gobs of prizes when they showed 
up. Of course they would spend $10,000 on tickets.

Hope to see you there.
