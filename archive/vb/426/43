Subject: Parking In The Pines - Oct 2010 - Golden, CO

Parking In The Pines is set this year for the weekend of October 15th. Bring
your blankets and heaters and come enjoy camping with no bugs. We "should" be
having a repeat of donated goodies from GoWesty as well as some other things
we've picked up along the way. All for the making of a nice raffle.
