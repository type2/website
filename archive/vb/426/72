Lift the whole front end off the ground and spin your steering wheel. Should 
be smooth and very easy to turn with just a finger tip on the rim of the 
wheel.

Subject: [VB] Speaking of tight streering


I have two 67 busses. 1 turns with complete ease. The other is just more
difficult. Both have new Hancook tires. I pulled the spindles off and 
checked
tortion bars all ok regreased. New pitman arm and tie rods. New center pin
(the 1 where you ream the brass bushings). I bought a used steering box and
swapped it out. All no help. I adjusted king pins but i suspect that they 
are
NFG because everything else is new. No knocks or hang ups or noise just more
difficult that the other 67. Yes i have played with the adjusting bolt on 
the
steering box again no help. Any ideas????????

TIA Ken
