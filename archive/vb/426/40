Subject: Re: [T2] Jerome

Sorry Chris, I begging off on Jerome or the Catherine Creek (OR)(same
dates) campout this year because of health problems that I'm tackling at the
moment through all of September.  It'll be the first time I've missed Jerome
in a decade.
:(
I would have headed out from Ventura on the 16th anyway (gotta bit farther
to go than you i suspect).

Have fun! :)
