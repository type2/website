Subject: What's the going rate for a 21 window Samba

Hi,

I was wondering what the going rate is for a 21-window Samba resto project -
assuming it will need the bottom six inches replaced and has no middle or
rear seat. I see finished ones that go for $30,000 to $50,000 or more -
which I can't afford.
