x2... if the steering is binding, then adjust the box.
It is probably a tad too tight.
Sometimes people adjust it too tight hoping to take out play.
  That is incorrect adjusting, and causes a binding issue.

Tom,
Did you check out the adjusting screw on the side of your steering gearbox?
 still think you may have a problem there.
