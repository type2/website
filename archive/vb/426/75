Subject: Buses By The Depot and Bus Depot Warehouse Sale (Pa.)

A reminder that Buses By The Depot, and our annual Warehouse Sale, are this
coming weekend. The weather forecast looks great - sunny and 70 degrees!   

See http://busdepot.com/BBD2010.htm for more info. 

It's free for a day trip, or $15 to camp overnight. (That's per night,
Friday or Saturday. Most people only stay Saturday night, but about 20% stay
both nights.) You should reserve in advance if you want to camp, as this
will place you with us rather than elsewherre in the campground. (We have an
entire loop to ourselves.)  I can take reservations as late as Friday
evening, but I don't advise waiting that long.  It's first come first serve,
and last year we sold out. If you decide upon arrival to camp, you can find
me or Dan Sheridan and we'll sell you space if there is any left. If not,
you can buy a site from the park ranger that is outside of our loop (but
still a short walk), but it will cost you $35 instead of $15. 

If you have already reserved, I will be emailing confirmations and site
assignments on Thursday night.

Saturday at 2:30 there will be a caravan to the Bus Depot for our annual
Warehouse Sale, followed by a potluck dinner back at the campground.  Scroll
to the bottom of http://busdepot.com/BBD2010.htm for in-store coupons of up
to 20% off our entire in-stock inventory, and up to 90% off
clearance/distressed merchandise. These are literally the largest storewide
discounts we've ever run in company history, and they will be for attendees
only. Basically I need to make space. I took full advantage of the strong
dollar this spring, and 4 container loads later we'e bulging at the seams. I
need to clear some room for the next two containers coming in November.
(Hint: If you plan to take advantage of this, order in advance as noted on
the coupon, and then add to it if desired upon arrival.)

Please feel free to pm me if any questions.  I look forward to seeing you
there!
