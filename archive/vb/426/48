  There is a product called Froth Packs that looks like2 barbecue tanks 
that come with a bunch of disposable nozzles. I would read the label 
carefully. We do not manufacture it, and I really haven't paid it much 
attention simply because repairing equipment and answering questions 
about our stuff keeps me pretty busy..
