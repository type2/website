  Not sure if anyone has mentioned that the pin in the worm is supposed 
to rotate as well - at least that's how it is on a '64 bus

There might be issues it it seized, wore some flats, someone adjusted it 
then it broke free and rotated meaning it would go tight.

I would isolate the stiff part of the steering, and if it's the box then 
take the cover off to have a proper look.  You can make a new gasket 
from card.
