Subject: Re: [VB] Reduction box half removal

  On the later big nut RDG there is a big nut behind a blanking core 
plug.  The core plug is behind where the springplate bolts on to the 
RGB. I weld a nut onto the plug and use somthing like a brake drum 
extractor to remove it.  You should replace the core plug with a new 
one.  With it removed you can get to the big nut on the end of the drum 
axle.

ISP West do replacement plugs:

If it's an earlier small nut trans, there's not nut but the axle and 
bearings are a good fit in the case so you may still need an extractor 
to split the case - I've done it without though.
