Hi MJ,
Could be your rubber brake lines are going bad.  When they do that the
lines turn into one way valves and the brakes stay on.  Have found
those lines need to be replaced ever 5 to 8 years.

Not sure how the lug bolts could be loose after the wheel flew off.  If
the wheel flew off the lugs would not be still in the drum, unless the
holes in the rim were so big the lugs just slipped through.....
