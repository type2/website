Subject: Bus BOO! October 1-3 West Olive, MI (Buses By the Beach Event)

Hello Fellow Volks Folks,

Buses By the Beach is going back to the beach! We are very excited about our
new location on the sandy shores of Lake Michigan at Camp Blodgett. Join us
October 1-3, 2010 in West Olive, MI for our 8th Annual Halloween Themed
Campout; Bus BOO! The weekends events include: Costume contests for adults
and kids, site decoration contest, Chili Cook Off, spending time with good
friends and enjoying nature and the beach. Hopefully the surf will be up for
those bringing boards! There is a great paved bike path that runs along the
property between Grand Haven, MI and Holland, MI incase you would like to
take a ride or a walk. There are also many hiking and Mountain Bike trails
in the area. On the property there is a High Ropes Course and a Rock
Climbing wall! We are currently working on lining up professionals to make
this activity available for kids and adults. We have around 60 acres of
mostly wooded land to set up on. It is a beautiful piece of property and we
hope you can join us. 

 

Buses By the Beach is a IRS Designated 501C3 Non-Profit organization that
hosts events to raise money for the Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors.
