It really depends on how complete a project and how rusty it is.
All those little shiny doo-dads and the sunroof mechanism and rust repair
panels and body work can add up when you are buying them.

Here are some 21s for sale to check out:
Keep in mind they have not sold, and in todays economy, perhaps fewer people
are buying, so the sellers may be negotiable on the price.  But keep checking
them out and you will get an idea of what people ask for them.

What should I look for when buying a Bus?

Hi,
I was wondering what the going rate is for a 21-window Samba resto project -
ssuming it will need the bottom six inches replaced and has no middle or
ear seat. I see finished ones that go for $30,000 to $50,000 or more -
hich I can't afford.
