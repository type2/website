Subject: Totally New Bus Add-A-Room!

At the end of the month we will be introducing a completely redesigned
Add-A-Room for your VW Bus. I'm very excited about this product. I'm a big
fan of Bus side tents, and have used many over the years, both genuine
Westfalia and aftermarket. Each one I've used has elements that I loved or
hated, and I always wished I could combine the best of them into a single
tent. So I did. Literally two years in design, this new Add-A-Room takes the
best elements of half a dozen different German tents, and adds some new
twists not found on any of them. For example, every side can be lifted up or
extended outward into an awning, and there is a fully attached yet
removeable floor.

Since I was working from a clean slate, I also decided to offer a version in
colors that complement a Bus. For a number of years most side tents have
been designed with Vanagons, Eurovans, etc. in mind, and color coordinated
to those vehicles (usually gray, with maybe blue or green). On this
Add-A-Room, besides the obligatory gray version, I have also produced a
version in brown and beige, with just a splash of yellow (on the curtains
and trim). This is designed to complement either tan or yellow poptop
canvas, and also evoke the color of the original Westy tents of the late
60's and 70's. While I could not exactly duplicate the 30 year old colors,
they do come reasonably close, and overall are a much better match for most
Buses than anything made over the last 10-15 years. 

For a short time I am offering a special pre-order deal, where you get a
free 2nd-Room privacy/storage cabin if you order the Add-A-Room before they
ship at the end of the month.
