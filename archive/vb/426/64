Got under the bus for a few moments last night.

Adjusting the screw on the steering box didn't have any effect on the
tightness or the binding that I've been experiencing, so I suspect that
the problem (at least part of the problem) is elsewhere.  

Time for more grease, then some grease, and probably some more grease
after that.  

When I grease the clevis pin, should grease be just coming out the top
seal or should it be coming out the nut on the beam and the bottom 
seal as well?  

Thanks again for all your help and encouragement folks....

Cheers,
   Tom
