At the worst, pull the  pitman arm off the output shaft, clean it well, 
unbolt the box cover and pull out the shaft with the worm follower on it. 
The cover can be resealed with permatex. Be sure to check the adjustment 
when the cover is replaced. Be sure to mark or note the alignment marks on 
the end of the shaft and on the arm.

Lee is correct that the pin is in a roller bearing and rotates as it follows 
the worm gear path. There has to be a crack of play between the pin and the 
worm so that one side or the other of the pin is in contact with the worm. 
If the pin is too tight, or a bit of dirt gets in, the pin will not rotate 
smoothly and cause symptoms as you described.

  Not sure if anyone has mentioned that the pin in the worm is supposed
to rotate as well - at least that's how it is on a '64 bus

There might be issues it it seized, wore some flats, someone adjusted it
then it broke free and rotated meaning it would go tight.

I would isolate the stiff part of the steering, and if it's the box then
take the cover off to have a proper look.  You can make a new gasket
from card.
