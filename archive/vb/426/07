Hi Rick,
We just drain the RGB, then clean off dirt/rust/degrease the inner side
of the RGB, and the area of the swing plate that the RGB bolts to.
Apply a nice bead of RTV over the seam of the plug and quickly bolt the
RGB back onto the swing plate.  The RTV is sandwiched and seals in the
gear oil.

As far as how deep the plug goes, it has a lip inside the RGB and that
is as far as the plug will go.

E&B
