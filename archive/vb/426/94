Subject: Transmission Rebuild

I have a working 3 rib transmission for my 1969 Bus. I want to have it rebuilt
to freeway flyer specs (taller 4th gear for higher freeway speeds). Right now
it max's out at 55, 60 with a good tailwind... Does anyone know a good
reputable builder in the Los Angeles/Inland Empire area? Any help would be
greatly appreciated.
