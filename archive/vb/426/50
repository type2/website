. . .Where to start??

While spray foam may be the choice of some, all I can say is that you
had better be prepared to do all your own work on your bus in the
future.  I had a bus in my shop here with a spray foamed interior.
There's no way I'm touching that bus.  It makes the simplest of jobs a
nightmare because the foam gets into everything.  As Murphy's Law
dictates, everything that can go wrong will go wrong UNDER THE FOAM!!
If your bus needs future body work, I don't know a body guy who will
be willing to spend the days it would take to chip that crap out in
order to do just a simple hammer & dolly work to prep for paint. . .
There is good reason you don't see this employed on new cars.  Think
about it folks!!

I have to say that this sort of "improvement" is exactly the kind of
stuff that the term "DPO" (Dumb Previous Owner) is derived.  Don't
perpetuate the "D". . .

Sorry, but someone had to say it. . .

As a side note: I have had nothing but good results from the aluminum
skinned bubble paper insulation and spray adhesive.  High R rating and
easy to work with.
