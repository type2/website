 Maybe the needle/bearing is sticky or the return spring broke?

Well, it has been a really long time since I've had a speedometer that
far apart, and those were Jetta/Vanagon speedos at that, so I don't
know how much the principles interchange.

The main problem on those speedos was a nylon gear that shrank and
split with age, allowing it to spin on the shaft it was attached to.
Fresh gear from another speedo and you were back on your way.

Don't remember exactly how the speedometer works either. It has to be
a mechanical connection to change the spinning motion of the cable
into the pivoting motion of the needle.

Usually the spring fouls up there as it is rather delicate. But that
usually leaves your needle in an odd position rather than just stuck.

Have you tried spraying oil into it and gently testing the needle for
ability to move?

On those other speedos, after driving the aforementioned gear, the
shaft goes through the middle of the numbers, driving a similar gear
on the other end of the shaft which drives the gears on the numbers. I
believe the numbers have to come off to access the driven element for
the needle, but I don't remember what it looks like.
