Thanks Chris.

I was recently reading Bob Hoover's TLUZ notes on Steering, Alignment, etc. while
trying to better inform myself on what might be going on and I've taken his
advice with a good deal of weight:

"See that bolt? [...] LEAVE IT THE (*#$ ALONE!" 
     - Bob Hoover (paraphrased, caps may have been added by me)

I figure I'll take the time to get the steering "not tight by default" before
I even consider adjusting that bolt.  :)

thanks for confirming this is the way to go...

cheers,
  tom
