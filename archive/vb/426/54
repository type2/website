I've heard that when a splitty slides into a curb or some such hard  
sideways knock, that the steering worm gets a small chip broken off.   
Once this happens you can never really adjust the steering box  
anymore.  I changed out the box on my rhd '66 with a nice used  
steering box when I lived in New Zealand.  That box would have been  
hard to source in Arizona!
