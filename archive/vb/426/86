Subject: Hey everyone!

Hey,

Its time for everyone to chime in and tell about your bus and where its been
and what cool innovations you have added.

I have a 64 Double Door Kamper Kit. This one is special since my Dad purchased
it New and I was with him when he picked it out. I inherited the bus in 1972
and drove it as a daily driver until 1995. In that time it was used to commute
occasionally from LA to the San Francisco Bay area. It also made a journey to
the east coast and back in 1974. The return was with a cracked case. Couldn't
get it over 60mph as the clutch was well oiled and would slip. Had to add a
quart with every gas fill up. When my kids were younger, we made a few camping
trips including a trek up to Vancouver for the Expo in 1986. Its also been to
the Grand Canyon, Lake Tahoe, and Albuquerque, NM.  After 1995, it sat in
front of my house, driven occasionally until 2001 when I had it in for
restoration. I had the shop make a couple of minor mods, splice in a 67 dash
so I could install a CD player and the upper delivery style ventilation
louvers are closed off. Since then its been a garage queen and looks as good
as when I drove it home from the shop. It won a second place this year at the
Pt. Fermin VW meet. I like to do my own basic maintenance, however I have been
known to rebuild the engine and to remove the trans for rebuild. Currently
running a 1776 dual port with a weber progressive carb and stock exhaust.
