Subject: Steering *clunk*

Happy Friday Volks!

I have a budding problem with my '67 that I'm hoping isn't what I think it is (a bad steering box).

Basic behavior is that when I turn the steering wheel under load, it gets harder to turn, then there's a slightly audible *clunk* as the steering wheel moves abruptly (if only slightly).  If you continue to turn the wheel in the same direction, it will happen again.

The result is that the bus doesn't turn even as you're turning the wheel, then it turns abruptly, if just a bit (but enough to be dangerous).

Again, this appears to only happen under load - i.e. while moving.  When I'm parked (or moving very slowly, I believe) the wheel turns freely and normally.

Its at the point where I don't really feel like she's safe to drive (says the guy who drove her the 9 miles into work this morning), but I'm not really sure what's up.

Full disclosure: I haven't gotten under the bus to do a visual yet, or pulled the belly pan. Steering damper was replaced at some point in the last few years.

Any thoughts?

Cheers,
  Tom
