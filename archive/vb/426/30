According to the entry that his wife posted on his blog, http://bobhooversblog.blogspot.com/, Bob passed on August 13.

He was nice enough to answer a couple of my technical questions through RAMVA over the past 10 years.  Whether you agreed with his advice or not, he definitely had strong opinions about many technical issues regarding aircooled VWs, and a writer's flair for sharing and expressing them with style.  You don't see a lot of that kind of 'old school' artistry these days.

Speaking of RAMVA, someone there has done a Google Groups search of all his postings 1996-2010 if anyone here would like to access it:
