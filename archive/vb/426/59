If you've ever driven a splitty with a steering box in excellent  
condition you'll notice that the steering gets slightly tighter at  
center.  This allows you to cruise down the road without constantly  
adjusting the steering wheel to stay going straight.  When everything  
in the front suspension and steering box is in great shape these old  
buses are very nice to drive.
