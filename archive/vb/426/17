Subject: Rear brake disaster '59 Single Cab.

Looks like I got the matter resolved, although I need to road test it more.

I wanted to thank all of you who offered a tips and advice on this project.
Very helpful to me and I hope the repairs hold.

Friendly suggestion:  If any of you have old Bus parts laying around or an old
bus to part out KEEP EVERYTHING!!!  Some of these  parts are almost impossible
to locate.  Thanks to Samba and its' participants as well.

Keep truckin'
