Subject: Upcoming 25th BNNTA VW camping weekend...

"Buses Nowhere Near The Arch #25 (B.N.N.T.A.)

when:  Friday September 3rd thru Monday September 6th, 2010

where:   the entire "group" campground at the Indian Creek Recreational Area
located right on huge Mark Twain Lake, which is about 30 miles west of
Hannibal, Missouri.

Any and all VW's are welcome to enjoy this BNNTA family-oriented camping
event. Featuring VW camping on a 22 mile long lake, an informal VW Bus show, a
fun and highly competitive best individual and best group campsite decoration
contest, a scenic countryside caravan on Saturday over to discover the sights
of historic Hannibal, MO (the childhood hometown right on the Mississsippi
River of Samuel Clemens, a.k.a. "Mark Twain"), Bus show awards and door
prizes, campfire activities, slow drags, etc.  Our campground is lakeside, so
bring your watertoys (canoes, kayaks, etc.).  BNNTA is held in a beautiful
Corp of Engineers built/managed campground with very nice facilities, clean
bathrooms and nice shower facilities, a playground and a huge pavilion for our
sole use.  We restrict access to the campground to only VWs, so you won't wake
up in the morning staring at the side of a motorhome, just the beautiful sight
of VWs of all types sprawling off into the distance!

The "total" event/camping fee for each VW for the entire four day weekend is
only $30.  Yep!  A total of only $30!  Oh! And if you have something VW
related that you want to donate to the door prize stash, please bring it
along.

Thanks again for your time, and we hope that you and your VW can join all of
us for the long holiday weekend!


Your hosts,

Bill & Kathryn Bowman
