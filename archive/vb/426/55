I agree with the "spray foam is evil" concept.


Step away from the spray foam.   Go on, put it down.  It'll be okay.

...... As Murphy's Law dictates, everything that can go wrong will go wrong
UNDER THE FOAM!! If your bus needs future body work, I don't know a body guy
who will be willing to spend the days it would take to chip that crap out in
order to do just a simple hammer & dolly work to prep for paint. . . There is
good reason you don't see this employed on new cars. Think about it folks!!

I have to say that this sort of "improvement" is exactly the kind of stuff
that the term "DPO" (Dumb Previous Owner) is derived. Don't perpetuate the
"D". . . Sorry, but someone had to say it. . .

As a side note: I have had nothing but good results from the aluminum skinned
bubble paper insulation and spray adhesive. High R rating and easy to work
with.
