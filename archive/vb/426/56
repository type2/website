Clara,

The binding seemed to happen either in the center of turning the wheel
(each time it made a revolution) or in the center when the wheels were 
straight.  As it was only happening when in motion (which was pretty
scary), I couldn't be certain as I was focused more on keeping the bus on 
the road than anything else.

Now that it's up on jacks the steering just seems tight overall and like 
it's binding towards left lock (which is odd).  Link pins appeared to be 
adjusted as per a quick test (from Hoover?) but they're on the list.  The
only other slop appears to be in the center pin (up/down motion) and 
between the steering box axial arm/drag link.  Overall slop isn't bad -
maybe a quarter turn? - but the steering has always been a bit 
dodgey/wiggley.  

I think the answer is - as you've said - grease it, and start adjusting
the other front end components to ensure they're at spec.  When those
are all done and if the steering is still tight, I'll peg it as the 
steering box and get a rebuild to install.  Oh, and I'll send a picture
of the play in the arm when I get around to it.

Anyway, I've been meaning to take the splitty off the road for a bit 
for a whole bunch of maintenance...tranny's got a solid whine in 4th, 
some cancer that needs to be taken care of before it gets worse (and/or 
holes that need to be patched), etc.  This looks like a good excuse to 
finally do it...(plus the fatchick is almost back on the road, which is 
the other thing I've been waiting for).

Thanks for the sound advice and reminder on the regular maintenance
that should be done...uh...more regularly.  

Hmm...grease...

Woot!
