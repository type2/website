Subject: Re: [T2] Droopy Rear Hatch Repair (Warning!!! Not for the meak 

Hi,

This affects splits too.
I repaired an ovaled out hole in a friends hatch mechanism by drilling out 
the hole and inserting a brass bushing. I was able to use a standard 
bushing, cut it to the correct length and drill the I.D. to the correct bolt 
size (both operations performed with my drill press). The bushing pressed 
lightly into the drilled hole. The hatch now works perfectly. I believe this 
was an excellent repair and should last about as long as the bus. Not only 
that, the bushing would be easy to replace.

NOTE: Those torsion springs pack a WALLOP. Use EXTREME care in dealing with 
them. Wouldn't want anyone to lose a finger.
