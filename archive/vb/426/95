Subject: Re: [VB] Transmission Rebuild

Isaac,

Why not try Rancho. They have a good rep on the list. They did my swing axle 
with a fwy flier R&P.
You sure that the problem is not with the engine that you can't do better 
than 60?
With a 1600 SP and a 28psit carb I could always do at least 65 in my 64DD 
Kamper. With dual port and a bigger carb and header exhaust with quiet pack 
muffler it did 70 easily.

I have a working 3 rib transmission for my 1969 Bus. I want to have it 
rebuilt
to freeway flyer specs (taller 4th gear for higher freeway speeds). Right 
now
it max's out at 55, 60 with a good tailwind... Does anyone know a good
reputable builder in the Los Angeles/Inland Empire area? Any help would be
greatly appreciated.
