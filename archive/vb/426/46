  I work with spray foam on a daily basis.  Here's the facts

The spray foam in a can (great stuff etc) is an open cell product.  As 
the name implies, the cells are open and can (will) permit the transfer 
moisture and air.
The spray foam that the insulation/roofing professionals spray with 
specialized equipment can be either open or closed cell.  I would 
recommend against the open cell for the reason stated above.
Closed cell foam is it's own air and moisture barrier.  On a properly 
prepared surface (if you can paint it you can spray it) it adheres 
extremely well.  Most closed cell foams approved for residential use are 
/almost/ self extinguishing and produce little smoke.  The R value runs 
in the mid 6's.
It adds to the structural rigidity of what it is applied to.
Being a rigid substance, it attenuates sound somewhat but since you have 
glued the vehicle together you now have a more solid structure and sound 
transmission will increase.

Be careful of overspray.

I will foam my next bus.
