Hi All,

On this one, the generator has been replaced by an alternator. Small
regulator attached to fan shroud looks like external electronic
regulator. Also has aftermarket ammeter installed below dash.
Generator light on the dash comes on when the key is turned on, and
goes off when the engine is started.

Previous owner said he had battery problems. I found the fan belt too
loose, adjusted it and drove home with no problems.

I really liked the ammeter. The engine would start nicely with just a
slight bump of the starter, and then the ammeter would show about 10
amps charging for about 5 or 10 minutes and then go down to a couple
of amps to keep the system running.

I kept having problems with a discharged battery. I took it off and
charged it overnight, but the hydrometer showed the battery to be in
only fair condition, so I installed a new battery.

I charged the new one overnight, and the next day it read a full
charge with the hydrometer, so I installed it. Things started up fine,
and I felt satisfied as I watched the ammeter show a negligible
current flow since the battery had a full charge. Generator dash light
still coming on when the key is switched on and goes off when the
engine starts.

So I was happy and feeling satisfied, but then I tried turning on the
headlights to check for increased current flow. I was shocked when the
ammeter read far into the discharge side, maybe 10 or 15 amps.
Generator light is still off.

What is this telling me? Is the alternator no longer charging?

Thanks,

John
