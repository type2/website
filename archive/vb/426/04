Subject: RE: [VB] Reduction box half removal

How difficult is it to install a new core plug on a big-nut RGB? I have a
leaking one, with tranny oil seeping out between the RGB and the
springplate.

Is it a press-in or a tap-in? How precise must the depth of installation be?
Anything special needed to make the installation leak-free? My RGB leak is
the only thing keeping my '67 off the road. I'm on the US East Coast, where
knowledgeable VW shops are far and few.

Thanks for any help.

  On the later big nut RDG there is a big nut behind a blanking core plug.
The core plug is behind where the springplate bolts on to the RGB. I weld a
nut onto the plug and use somthing like a brake drum extractor to remove it.
You should replace the core plug with a new one.  With it removed you can
get to the big nut on the end of the drum axle.

ISP West do replacement plugs:

If it's an earlier small nut trans, there's not nut but the axle and
bearings are a good fit in the case so you may still need an extractor to
split the case - I've done it without though.
