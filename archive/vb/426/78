Hey Anyone going to Transporterfest this weekend?

It is this Sunday, in Brookline, MA. For more info see here:

EventId=105

Not sure if I am taking my '69 single cab, or the '65 kombi.but I'll be
there.

I hope to see some of you guys there...and maybe I'll be able to put
faces/vw's to list names...otherwise you are all just a collection known as
'the list'.
