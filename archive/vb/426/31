Subject: Speedometer stuck, 1966 standard

Hi All,

On the way back from a hike this morning, my speedometer
decided that 35mph was my speed and decided to stay there.

I've had this speedometer apart before when all of the digits
of the odometer decided turn in unison with the one's digit.
A bit of lubrication fixed it up (this was 10000 miles or more ago).

Has anyone here fixed a speedometer where the speed indicator
stuck?  Could it be a broken gear inside?  If so, can the gear be
glued back together or will I need to find a new part (or used part)?

Thanks for any insight into this problem.
