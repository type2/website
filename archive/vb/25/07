Subject: Where theres smoke...

Howdy Y'all,
I hooked up my heater boxes on the '66 ('71 engine 1600 DP)last weekend (they had been disconnected since I got the bus this spring) and believe it or not I was getting pretty good heat coming through the vents.  However, the air control flaps do not seal very well and heat continued to come in even when they were shut (probably why they were disconnected in the first place).  Anyway, It was very warm here yesterday afternoon, and I wanted to drive the bus to go look at a 70 westy I am going to be aquiring, but I didn't want to sweat, and i didn't feel like crawling under and disconnecting the boxes, Soooo I thought i would disconnect the paper hoses in the engine compartment coming from the fan shroud to lessen the circulation of hot air into the bus.  well, apparently YOU SHOULD NOT do this.  After driving about 20 minutes I smelled something hot and got out to see one of the heater boxes smoking like crazy!  I let it cool off, reconnected the hoses and it seemed to be fine.!
!
 So to make a long story even longer here is my question: Should this have happened?  Is there likely a problem with that heater box?  Or did it probably just have some oil or something on it and without the fan air, just got hot enough to burn the gunk off?
