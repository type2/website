AT the Cow Palace yesterday I bought a neat postcard of an early westy cabana.

The bus is a yellow deluxe with red bumpers, I also see rectangular mirrors!

310 Westlake North
Seattle 9, Washington
still exist? And what date is this from?

As I have limited space on this website it will not be there for long
