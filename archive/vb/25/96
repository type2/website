  this is bad cuz
  a) these shims are getting hard to find and
  b) there are shims in the case!!! :P >>
 
 Also bad because they are in the area of the case with the large cam gear 
and 
 can easily get sucked up in between the two gears!  Remove oil pump and fish 
 them out now or enjoy an engine rebuild soon.  Eric&Barb

How about trying with a magnet on a flexible stick-   remove the circle oil 
drain and screen.
