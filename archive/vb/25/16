Oval bug and bus are the same, Ghia are different. I have Hella repo's in
clear and orange, I also have cheap repop's at a lot less cost.

I have a bullet front turn signal... right one, i think.
is this the same on a bus as on a bug or ghia from the relevant years? ww
catalog shows different numbers, but danged if the drawings don't look
identical...
