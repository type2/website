Subject: Busses and Balloons 2001

Our website is down, but we're up for Busses and
Ballons V.  On October 5th and 6th, during the
Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, we're having
the fifth edition of Busses and Balloons!  The FAA
lifted the restriction on lighter-that-air flights, so
the Fiesta is on!

Check it out: camping Friday and Saturday night, a car
show Saturday with a FREE lunch for all from our
sponsor Foreign Aide and raffles, awards, and all the
usual, plus a great time around my campfire.  P-mail
me for a copy of the flyer.  Hope to see you there.
