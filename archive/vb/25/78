Subject: RE: [VB] 1960DC Pop- Outs??

My 59 dc (may 19,1959) has pop outs of course... the latches are different
than most.  They should have small black knobs instead of the white ones.  I
don't have any frames from a kombi to compare with so I can't comment
whether or not they are different.  I do have an extra pair of frames and
glass (with out latches) that I'm hoarding.....

At Jerome there were questions about the pop-out windows on our 1960DC-- How
many of you out there have early DCs with Pop-Outs?
I know back in the Good Old days of VW--You could order anything you wanted
for your VW--and VW would come through for you--, uj
