 I have a bullet front turn signal... right one, i think.
 is this the same on a bus as on a bug or ghia from the relevant years? ww
 catalog shows different numbers, but danged if the drawings don't look
 identical...

belive ww uses real 9 digit VW parts numbers- the first number mean the first 
car the part was used on- 113, 111 etc - bug, 211- bus(panel), 241 deluxe 
bus, 261 -truck,  etc

some of the pointy turn signal stuf is shared, some is unique.
