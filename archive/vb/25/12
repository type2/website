Subject: Re: [VB] Where theres smoke...

The heater boxes must have airflow at all times to prevent overheating.
There is a small waste valve at the front (fif) of the heater boxes that
allows air to flow through and out even when the air to the cabin is
shut-off.

>. Soooo I thought i would disconnect the paper hoses in the engine
compartment coming from the fan shroud to lessen the circulation of hot air
into the bus.  well, apparently YOU SHOULD NOT do this.  After driving about
20 minutes I smelled something hot and got out to see one of the heater
boxes smoking like crazy!  I let it cool off, reconnected the hoses and it
seemed to be fine.!
