<<Today is Friday, of course, so please feel free to
get the various non-bus threads out of your system,
and then let's getback to being a bus-related list.>>

Oh great Thom . . . this means we can now discuss the many things we
would like to do to RAT BASTARDS that attempt to hijack our airplane? he
hehe.. Or perhaps I can relate just how pissed I am at being called a
racist and the offender still has not offered an apology??!!! The nerve
of some people.

Anyways, I just read an intersting article in the Baltimore Sun about
the Afghanistan people and how much they are suffering. If the US can
drive the RAT BASTARD TALIBAD MONSTERS out, it is very likely the
Afghanistan people will become a great freind of the US.

Now to bus content. . . I borrowed a Mig welder for the weekkend, so I
must get very busy. Looking forward to installing all that new sheet
metal.
