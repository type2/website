Subject: a visit to Creative Engineering in England

Hi All....

The day Before the World Trade Center crash I visited Creative Engineering in 
Southern England,
He normally does not have visitors, but I got an invite thru my friends at 
Volksworld.

his website is http://www.creative-engineering.com/products/index.html

DavePalmer  is a very knowledgeable guy, he used to build street rods so he 
knows about building things from scratch. He was over here for OCTO and VW 
Classic.

Anyway the shop is  compact but they use all the room, Dave showed me the 
rear side panels he made, the roof racks, pop-out side windows etc.

One new product coming up is an aluminum safari window, the profile is like 
the factory safaris, a box section in the middle for strength,  they looked 
great.

Anyway you can go to his website to check it out, he will do mail order
 (I do not think the aluminum safaris are on there yet-just email him)

I think Ronnie is planning on carrying his stuff,  His order was there ready 
for shipment.

Dave has great talent, I am glad he is putting it to good use making bus 
parts !
Check out the bus he built on the cover of this months Volksworld.........
