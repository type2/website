When I have people visit me here on the Dry side of Oregon (LaGrande) from
the east coast, if they are at all attentive to cars, they always ask me why
there is such a strong interest in *old* cars... My comments are always that
they just last!!!!  Heck, I turned down a cushy job in Madison WI one time
and told the guy that 'they salt the roads and I like old VWs... which don't
mesh well with each other'... he couldn't believe that was my reasoning :-)
