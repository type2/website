For some reason I have the impression that there are a lot of old VW in the 
middle east.  There were dealerships there in the 60s and don't think much 
rust.   So probably the terrorists know how to hot wire a bus.

How are your locks window latches, door slider window springs and felts?

Anyone have a world dealership guide- did they have them in Afganistan?
  I have met a couple Middle Eastern people, and a Somalian, who said they 
had splittys back there in the desert.  With all the Turks working in 
Wolfburg, I am sure there are VWs in Turkey too.
