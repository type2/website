Subject: Looking for 15" Rim

Hey all,

I've got a rear tire with a slow leak.  I've had the tire inspected twice 
with no signs of damage, but every five days or so it gets down to about 
15lbs of air.  I've a sneaking suspicion that it's the rim.

So I'm on the hunt for anyone who happens to have a good, straight 15" rim 
for sale.  I'd love to find two rims so I can replace the bent one that is 
currently my spare tire, but I need at least one rim right now.  I'm over 
in San Jose, CA.

Thanks,
-Taylor
