Subject: Engine fire foiled!

I drove my singlecab home from work yesterday and smelt gasoline.
When I looked at the fuel lines from the fuel pump to the filter & the 
carburetor, just bending them caused the gas to drip onto the engine.
I can only imagine the gas spurting out when the engine is running onto the 
hot engine!
I bought a couple of feet of new 5 mm fuel line and installed it, no gasoline 
drips & all is dry.
Please everyone check you flexible gas lines, 40 year old gas lines do 
deteriorate and can be dangerous if not replaced.
