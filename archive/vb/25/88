All this coming from the people trying to kill the aircooled VW.....And
those promoting it....VWOA gets a thumbs down from me, no matter who they
help......I'm sure it will be a huge tax writeoff for them, don't be fooled,
they are out to help themselves...

You guessed it, these watercooled airheads are not among my favorite group
of people....

Nice effort VWOA, but start helping those who got you to the point you are
now, instead of shutting us down for using your symbols, and you might sell
a few more cars to true VW enthusiast.....
