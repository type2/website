Subject: Re: [VB] 1960DC Pop- Outs??

I have a early '62 with pop outs.  The latches look like typical later 60's
latches with the white knobs on the top and bottom of the latch.  I think they
are original.  Strange that the knobs are white and not black like everything
else on this commercial (BTW 54K original when I bought it).

What do yours look like?
