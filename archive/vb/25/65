Subject: Time for some new lists

Okay, here's the deal, I think it's past time for a
few new lists. How about:

The WTC list
The Islamic Militant Terrorist list
The "Let's go/not go to War list"

So, until an early VW bus is blown up in the WTC
parking garage by Islamic Militant Terrorists, there
is no need to post to this list about it or what
should be done about it.

Now please excuse me, I have some posting to do on the
"Piss and moan about Crossposting" list.
