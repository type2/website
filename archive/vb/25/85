Subject: help needed with barndoor rear brakes 

Anyone got a diagram of how to put together barndoor rear brakes?
For some reason I can't figure it out.....I ended up with six tension
springs when i think I'm only supposed to have 4?
Anyone got a pic so I can get my 54 back together?
I shoulda paid mo attention when i was taking it apart.
I also need one of the little oil splash tubes (goes form center of drum to
outside by a little metal tube) for inside the rear drum.
Thanks-
Regards,
