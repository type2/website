Subject: custom scale models

i've become interested in volkswagen scale models.  roger (67 buses) sent me a number of urls for vendors that deal with scale models.  one of them not only does a whole host of scale model manufactures but also does customized models.

since jon is not on the list i can tell you all about the custom bus i had done for him.  jon's been kind of whining about how his shiny bus wasn't repainted the original color and he seems to find it particular offensive because the original color combo is one of his favorites.  i knew that there is a hatch top camper being made by brekina but it is green/white.  i asked jeff grant at german aircooled if he could do a gray/white one with a roof rack.  he could.

day before yesterday it came in the mail and it's so totally awesome!  the customization is very clean and it looks as if brekina issued it itself!  jeff did a wonderful job and the cost was a mere $23.45!  along with the custom camper, jeff sent a lapel pin with his url below a '50s era advertising picture of a barndoor standard.  the pin i think i'll keep for myself.

so if you've got a bus you want to pimp at shows, just think how nice a matching model would look.  or maybe you'd like to get your significant other to visualize your completed project.  not to mention that the holidays are around the corner.

the url for german aircooled is http://germanaircooled.com and they are located in mission viejo, california.  i'm not getting a cut on sales, i'm just an extremely happy customer.
