In 1963, a friend of my parents asked me to drive a
bus from Corpus Christi, Texas to Southern California,
and I got to drive a semiphore bus (can't remember if
it was a barndoor) halfway cross country at age 17.

1953 Buick Roadmaster (The Beast), 1959 Sunroof Bug,
1966 SO-42 Westy

1959 SO-23 Westfalia
1961 Flipseat Westfalia
1961 Doublecab (originally 12V)
1962 Panel (still waiting for bodywork and paint)
The Grateful Dead 1966 Standard should be running by
Busses and Balloons (October 5th and 6th)

All of them

The Panel and early Westy are pretty much stock.  The
others have '67 running gear (although the Flipseat
has 1776 dual-carb power)

I was a pacifist in the Vietnam era, and don't see any
reason to change now.
