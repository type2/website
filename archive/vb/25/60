Subject: To keep the 'RATS' out

  Hi Lester,
 I have found a great way to keep RATS, WEASELS, FINKS and all=20
other forms of undesirables out of my buses!  I do it with "BEEs", yes=20
that's correct!  I do have a small problem of getting in there to work=20
on the bus, but it works.  Check it out yourself at:
                                  =

I hope you can enjoy my humor at this painful time.
