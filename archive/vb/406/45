The shifter itself in a '67 and a '63 would be different as well. They used
different shift rods.

Well....no one's really answered Unca Jerry's question, so here goes......

Type 2's had 10mm Threaded Shifters/Knobs thru 1967.

Type 2's had 12mm Threaded Shifters/Knobs 68-79 along with early production
Vanagons.

Later production Vanagons (around 82 or 83-91) had 14mm Threaded
Shifters/Knobs.

Clara could be right in that you might have a 68-later shifter with a 12mm
Thread. Note: Current Replacement Brazilian Shifter Assemblies from Brazil
is essentially a 68-74 Shifter Assembly which works fine back to Vin 2x6 028
112. This has/uses a 12mm Knob.

Or, if the Shifter has been machined down, it might be 7mm for the 62-67
Beetle Knob.
