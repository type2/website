Hi Gary,
Have to say then that you are probably comparing apples to oranges.  The bus 
dual MCs we have been using have that screw.  Will keep an eye out for the 
non-screw type if they exsist in bus parts.
As to cost of rebushing a beetle dual MC.  Would find a used one with screw.  
If it cost twice the price to rebush, than to buy new non-screw Brazilian MC. 
 Rebushed one should last three to six times longer.  In the long run it is 
less expensive, much less trouble not having to replace it over and over, and 
safer to boot.
E&B

The brasilian MCs I've bought lack the stop screw between the pistons and I 
suspect this may be their weak point.
