meeting in Grand Rapids, MI May 15th - 18th 2008. This event is our main
fund raiser for the Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors. We are really
looking forward to seeing everyone and it looks like we are going to have
another great turn out again this year of Bus Pilots from all over the US
and Canada!
