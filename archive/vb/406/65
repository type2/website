Yoda, Yoda, Yoda,

If you don't buy it from an Exxon/Mobil station, You will buy it at a Union 
76 or a any other station. Exxon Mobil will find a market for the fuel 
somewhere. If Exxon Mobil stations aren't selling gas, they will simply 
close and the big comany will sell the fuel to the highest bidder.

If you want the price to drop, stop voting for the guys that refuse to allow 
the oil companies to drill off the coast and in Alaska. We also need to 
build some major refineries and get the price of the dollar back down. Oil 
is getting sold in Euros at this point, not dollars so the exchange rate is 
killing us too. The problem is not a simple one but multifaceted.

Sorry, I don't usually join the spam, but this one got to me.
We shoulda saved it for Friday.
