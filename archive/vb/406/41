for the shifter. The shifter knobs are notinterchangeable what year did this
happen

Something is wrong here. Someone has modified the threads.

All 03/50 to the end of the 1967 model year use the same knob. Only the color
changed for the 1967 model yr. From here:
http://oacdp.freeweb7.com/5867part/359.png  #5 is the knob.
113 711 141

3/50 - 7/66 is 466 silver beige and 7/66 up is 043 grey black
