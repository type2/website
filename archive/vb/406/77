Not sure I understand what you wrote here: "the split ref in online as a pdf
on obselete."   Huh?


Hi Karl,
Think we can translate that!!

"Splitscreen parts manuals can be viewed on the Obsolete Aircooled Documents page."

See vintagebus.com website and left click on the "Parts Manauals" there.

There used to be a late model bus parts manual on line, but does not seem to exsist on the websites we know of.
