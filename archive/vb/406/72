Our old buses get better mpg than the US fleet average for '08.  A  
1966 bus with a stock 1500 sp engine will get 25 + mpg at 60 mph.  It  
will get better than that driving less than 55mph.  I think that the  
US fleet average today is less than 24 mpg.  I wish that piston and  
cylinder sets were still available for 1500s.  1600s do seem to get  
less mpg....  Gary Gibson
