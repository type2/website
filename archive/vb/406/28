Subject: friday question

I was waiting for a friday.  I have Volkswagen
content, but not splitwindow.  I have a 68 beetle that
was a victim of a Hit and Run destroying the front
end.  I need everything from the windsheild forward. 
I was hoping someone on the list had a fiberglass
full-tilt street frontend with the look of the older
pre-67 bug's.  I was hoping someone here might be kind
enough to help me out.  Thanks list.
