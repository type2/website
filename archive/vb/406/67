Subject: Chain letter CRAP!!!

Are VW related e-mailing lists the place for chain letter drivel in  
the first place??  I would doubt that anyone hoped to be sent  
debunked, old chain letters when they signed up for this list. . .   
Sending these out is even a stretch for a Friday topic. . .

I guess since I'm not sending it on, I'm soon going to have really bad  
things happen to me. . . Bring it on!! ;-)
