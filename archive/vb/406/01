I suppose that two regulators might increase the flow, however my setting at 
3.5 seems to be working fine.

I purchased the my weber progressive carb in back in '86 at Scat and after 
quite a time trying to lean it out, they asked if I was using a regulator 
and of course my answer was "No, do I need one?"  To which they replied, 
"won't run right without it, vw fuel pump puts out too much pressure."
And there you have it! BTW I'm still running the original 1964 fuel pump. 
The only repair has been to chase the 5M thread with a tap, for the bolt 
that hold on the cap.

Cheers,
Chris
