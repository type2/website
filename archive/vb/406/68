OK, in the vane of keeping this topic oriented towards buses... Here  
are my tips for reducing your exposure to cost of gas...

1. Reduce drag and keep your exterior waxed, including tires and  
undercarriage.

2. Only drive in a straight line, and ideally downhill in neutral.

3. Only drive on the highway when you have a tailwind.
