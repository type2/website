Subject: Magoo's Bessie needs help

The motor on the left side developed leak about a month ago   we replaced
the air cooler with one that had been pressured tested and new seals   the
leak is back   I could just leave it do it's thing   or try to try repair
it.   In my crappy condition there is no I can pull the motor   there also
appears to be a few push rod tubes leaking as well. Not looking for a
freebie here   I will pay you for your time, hopefully uj
