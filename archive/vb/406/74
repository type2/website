I just checked inventory at all the local VW Dealers and almost every one
(including mine) have that washer in stock.

I highly recommend taking the part number with you as most counter guys
don't even know where to look those up!

Guessing you have a single circuit MC.  If so, suggest you check out  the 
type2.com llibrary for much safer dual circuit MC  install article there.
 
You can check out the "parts manuals" through the vintagebus.com  website.  
Yes for single circuit, you need a sealing washer.  Think it  is copper,
part 
number N 13 827 2.
