Never happen.

It's going to 4 bucks regardless of who your thinking of Boycotting.

If your not going to buy the juice from Exxon / Mobil, your going to get
it from Mr. Chavez.
What's the difference?

Somebody is going to get fat off of the petrolium prices---

And seeing as folks get more dependant on ther cars--ingnoring other
modes of transportation-the gas companies will continue to get fat.

The head guy in Washington has done nothing , will do nothing till his
tenure is up ,and he lines his pockets with our fuel money for his
retirement fund.

Ride a bicycle, ride a scooter, ride a  motorcycle for the summer.

It'll slow their cash flow down , but won't ever stop the greedy SOB's.
And even then they'll have the excuse to jack the prices up, because
they aren't selling enough.

It's a no win situation.
