NUMBER ONE:

I don't trust the origin of this as being from someone who really has 
the goal of lowering gas prices as their number one.

It smacks of someone who'd like to hurt Exxon/Mobile.

It is CHEVRON that is benefitting the most, by a long shot, from our 
current war.

If anyone gets boycotted, should be them.


NUMBER TWO:

This is just another slimy chain letter.  Please don't perpetuate it.


NUMBER THREE:

Admins, Ready, Aim, Fire!
