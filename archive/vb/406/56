If I can get enough of new orange bay Windows Bus to do diecast with NB
decals, several to what's been done with the splts in the past, would enough
folks be interested in buying them?
I have to go up on the price it will be either $8ea or $10ea.  May do a few
splits just to bring along. I'll pics of my decal idea in a few days.
