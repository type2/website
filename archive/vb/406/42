The front gear shift rod?changed in early 66 model year to the kind that takes the pin in the front.
At this time the stick shift was changed.
AFAIK, a 63 takes the same knob thread as a 67.
Maybe you have a bay stick shift in the cab of your 67... they do have different threads.
You could also check the online parts list re- knob changes.

I have a 1963   and a 1967. Bus  I have found out that there are two
different thread sizes for the shifter. The shifter knobs are not
interchangeable   what year did this happen
