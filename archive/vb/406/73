Hi Eric & Barb,
	A new dual circuit brake system is certainly safer than a non- 
working stock single circuit.  Still, I find the quality of the new  
dual circuit MCs to be so shabby that the simpler single circuit MC  
may be safer than the dual in the long run.  I have not had a single  
circuit fail on me in over 30 years ( I did have one go on me in  
1974) where the dual circuits fail without much warning or all at  
once.  The single circuit systems seem to give plenty of warning  
before they give up!  Mushy pedal, need to pump up at lights.  I end  
up replacing the "new" dual circuit MCs in my '74 super beetle every  
3-4 years after little use in my dry Arizona climate.  The new dual  
MCs seem to be poorly made......  Gary Gibson
