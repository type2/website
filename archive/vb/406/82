Hey Jerry,
	Good seeing you and Melissa at Colossal Cave last weekend!  I doubt  
that your oil leak is from the oil cooler if it was recently worked  
on.  Leaking pushrod tubes can sometimes be repaired pretty well  
without removing the engine using the spring loaded repair tubes.  I  
think that Bessie just wants to piss out some oil and that should be  
tolerated until you find out how bad it is.  It won't stop on its  
own, though.  Keep Bessie to less than one quart a day!  Gary Gibson
