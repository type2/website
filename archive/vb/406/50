Over 150+ vehicles including a Bentley and a Rolls 140+ venders of all
kinds,  lots of freebies and T-Shirts, 7th Ave was blocked off from Indian
School going North. Just two VWs showed up, but a 1967 Hippy bus was filmed
and will be shown on the program Chester's Garage via closed circuit TV.

People really like seeing VWs and asked for more. I also was lucky as two
Grateful Dead fans asked me if I wanted any old Grateful Dead stuff, as they
wanted to give them away to a person that  would  appreciate the
memorabilia. Please get your VW out these shows , you will make new friends,
and be given some good VW  treasures. Keep looking , They are always out
there. 

 

PS Please keep me in your daily prayers, every day I slip down a notch or
two.
