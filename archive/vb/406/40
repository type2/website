I found a generic engine stand on Craigslist in the
Sacramento area for $50, but I had to make some
adapters so the engine would fit, and I had to make
some other adapters to level the engine once on the
stand as the axis was not level, not sure why.

If I had to do it again, I'd hold out for a stand
designed for VW engines. Some of the parts places
stock them like aircooled.net or jbugs.com. They come
in both bench stands for about $50 and floor ones for
around $100.
