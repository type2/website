Subject: Re: [VB] Engine rebuild stand

This was recently bolted to my garage floor:

http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/album_page.php?pic_id=421635

We bought it in November.?? Greg wanted one for a while, took a while to?find it.? 
People don't want to sell them.
It's fairly heavy with the stand and all, but we bought it in person.?? 
It would be a pain/expensive to ship.? 
It has the attachments for holding a front beam, and
the arms with the butterflys for holding?axles on a transmission.

The flywheel lock part was missing.?? Bought that new.??
