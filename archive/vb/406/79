Hi Jerry,
Wish we were closer!!!
Had a problem with one engine with too much oil pressure.  Turned out to be 
too strong of aftermarket oil pressure relief spring causing the problem.  
Thank goodness for oil pressure gauge to show problem before blowing something. 
  Also VW changed oil pressure relief spring strengths and lengths in later 
DR engines...
E&B
