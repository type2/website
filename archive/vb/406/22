In addition to balancing, adding more weight to the center of the
rotating mass will not only help smooth things, it will add a bit to
fuel mileage.  Adding a CW crank, Equalizer steel pulley and a full
weight flywheel will all help.  Then get them all balanced together
including anything that rotates (clutch and disc too).

I like to use solid rocker shafts and carefully shim them to .002"
side clearance.  This quiets the rockers down really nice.  Add 911
adjusters and you will get really accurate valve adjustments that will
really quiet the valve clatter that stock adjusters cause.

Others touched on A Compufire/Pertronix ignition module.  These alone
make a motor easier to start and run cleaner with a more accurate
spark.  I run these with a blue coil and Bosch W8BC (extended tip)
plugs and run a slightly wider gap (which makes a hotter spark due to
the added coil soak time).  All this makes for a nice firing clean
burning ignition without spending a ton of $$$ on exotic stuff most
folks don't need off a race track.
