Hi Gary,
Well it would be interesting to hear the autopsy report on those Beetle dual 
MCs that failed on you.  Perhaps you should check out having a MC 
rebushed/rebuilt with a brass or stainless steel sleeve.  Yes, that would cost more, but 
worth it for the safety.
 
  So far with about ten years we have had no quality problems with the bus 
dual circuit MCs from Brazil.  The one time we have had a circuit fail it worked 
as advertised!!

The single circuit systems seem to give plenty of warning before they give 
up!  Mushy pedal, need to pump up at lights.  I end up replacing the "new" dual 
circuit MCs in my '74 super beetle every 3-4 years after little use in my dry 
Arizona climate.  The new dual MCs seem to be poorly made......  Gary Gibson
