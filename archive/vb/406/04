Subject: Fuel Pressure

Curt,
	Our engines don't need much fuel pressure.  Use the extra paper  
gaskets you get with a fuel pump and engine gasket set to shim up the  
pump.  3 psi is plenty of fuel pressure.  One gasket makes a big  
different in pressure.  I think that many problems people have with  
float needle valve leakage is actually high fuel pressure.  5 psi is  
too high.
