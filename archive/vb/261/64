Hi Wayne,

The Delux bus in the right of the same image is Steven Thomas's bus that he 
is selling due to lack of a job and needing to go back for more school.  He 
stopped by when he saw our "40HP At Work, Please Just Pass!! on the back and he 
seemed to be down in the dumps from having to put his bus up for sale.  So we 
told him how our lives were going to cheer him up!  ;-)  Had a great time 
seeing many old friends.  Dawn had Greyhounded up to Spokane with boxes of parts to 
bring back to life a 1965 SO-34 Westie she had bought long distance and it 
had not run for over 12 years!!  Great to see her getting into the deeper end of 
getting a VW running.

Saturday up at 0530 ands got in the swapper line.  We found lots of small 
pieces to keep our VWs on the road.  We now have plenty of 6 volt gen brushes and 
bearings for $2.00 each, and lots of knobs, heater clamp, and a ton of other 
stuff for a buck each, most from just one swapper.  He even tossed in a NOS 
Rabbit wiper motor gear for free since we knew what it was.  Picked up three 
differant VW dealer license plate frames though one was cracked.  Bought a set of 
three Westie tent brackets including one front bumper, front roof and one 
rear roof.  We left about 1PM, and went to the Pike Place Farmers Market which 
was very crowded.  Eric Got his Market Spice Tea he had been missing for the 
last 7 or so years.  We bought good food and walked around and had a great time 
though too hot.

Sunday we got up at 5AM and got out on the road about 5:45, made our way out 
to Pacific Raceway area and did not find the sign to it on the highway, turned 
around and found it on the direction!  Pulled up in line and the raceway 
opened thier gates 20 before 8AM.  Which was a good thing since they had 6AM 
posted on thier website! Bought a bunch of W. German made flex lines for our buses 
and a couple for one of our bugs for $9.00 each.  Also $10.00 for rebuilt 
front shoes for 1964-67 bus suspension which is what we run now and an NOS German 
left front slave cylinder for 15.00.  Found some dollar parts including a 
Repro VW white mud flap, and some head light rings for bus and bug.   By 1100 we 
had finished off the last of our weekend $300.00 spending money and we headed 
home.
