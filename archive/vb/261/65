Subject: green light on...dangit 

Hi all,
I have exhausted every form of information I have and
still can't find an answer to this problem.  I have a
1641 dual port and for some reason the oil light comes
on at idle after the engine heats up to about 180
degrees.  I originally thought that maybe the oil pump
wasn't creating the pressure that it should be so I
took it in and had it tested and that isn't the
problem.  At idle it had about 7lbs. of pressure.  The
sending unit is brand new and we even tried throwing
in another new one to see if it made any difference,
it didn't.  I've verified that the pressure relief
valve isn't stuck in the hole (that is the rear
one)but I didn't check the valve at the front of the
engine.  Front being front of course.  This engine is
close to being new, it is only a year old and has less
than 7,000 miles on it.  I am looking for any
information on what else I should be checking into,
the mechanic that tested the pressure said it looked
like the engine has the larger size oil pump and that
the light is annoying but doesn't appear to be causing
any trouble.  Any thoughts?
