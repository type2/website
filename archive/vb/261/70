Ya, find a mechanic who LIKES to work on splitties.  Isn't there some sort of 
registry for bus/ACVW friendly mechanics online?   On vintagebus.com or 
somewhere? 

Or learn to do it yourself.  Sorting out the lights is actually not too 
tricky.  usually all it is is cleaning up the connections/grounds, checking for 
power with a test light,  and making sure everything is connected right as per 
wiring diagrams (on vintagebus.com in colour)
