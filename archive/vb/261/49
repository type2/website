Subject: single cab wood strips

Hi All,

 

I removed the v80 ruthmann from the single cab yesterday (Sunday) to
replace the electrical harness and when I had it apart I noticed that
end of the wood strip next to the cab were cut off square and not
tapered like at the rear.  Is this typical?  I posted the story of the
work which includes a picture of the square ends of the wood strips.

 

David
