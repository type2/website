Hey All,

Last Saturday was BITS 3 over in San Jose.  T'was a good show...little low 
on the turnout, but a month's notice didn't give a chance for word to 
spread too far.  Had maybe 40 buses at the height.  Saw some familiar 
faces, met a lot of new ones.  Saw some buses I'd never seen before.  The 
swap was bolstered by an early morning dash by Roger, Richard Stewart, and 
Jon & Rachel to a local garage sale with a bunch of old VW parts.  I'm in 
the process of posting pictures to the Samba, but it's slow going on the 
network this evening, so I will post more tomorrow morning and then after 
work if I need to.  There's a lot of pictures, so enjoy and be patient.  :)
