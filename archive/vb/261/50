I have one that sounds _identical_ to this on my 60...

--Gang,

the '65 I acquired last month came with a tow ball.

it looks like some custom bumper brackets were made out of metal at
least 3/16" thick. to these were mounted the OG bumper and a piece of
angle iron which runs concealed parallel with and inside the bumper.

my bumper is cut to let the plate which the ball is bolted to to come
thru it, but there is only about 1/8" of annular space around the plate,
so it doesn't look too bad.

I have an extractor system with the single triangular flage and one of
those bug-style mufflers that points forward kind of, that hide under
the bug's curved rear end.

With a bolt on oilpump/filter, extractor kit, and the towhitch, it's
pretty busy back there, but everything is pretty well hidden, mounted,
clearanced, etc. Pretty happy for me as the new owner to have such a
great setup.

I could get pictures and sizes/dimensions if anyone was really
interested.

Billy
