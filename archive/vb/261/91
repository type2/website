Hi Craig,
First get the correct idle and main jet for your engine,  then you can 
experiment for the correct air correction jet in there.  Air correction jet leans 
out the carb at high RPMs!  The carb should work fine on that size engine as 
long as you are not going to do much over 3,500 RPMs.
  Your oil pressure is way too high for the hot weather.  Check your relief 
valve springs or risk blowing an oil seal in cooler weather.  Should be more 
like 40 and 10 psi in the summer.
  As for your oil temp it would help greatly to know what RPM you were 
running, MPH really has little affect to understanding what is going on.
