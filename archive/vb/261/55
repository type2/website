I agree.  I have a feeling that Gabe took the word of some script kiddie
that he'd have a slammin' good site in a week.

I'm getting plenty PO'd at folks who assume that everyone has a fast

latest download of various web "enhancers".  Pleh.

In fact, the only halfway decent use for flash I've found is the Bus
