Subject: RE: [VB] firewall grommets

I gave up a long time ago on finding correct grommets so I go to a good
hardware store or a Radio Shack. I always use a piece of fuel line with a
steel line through it for the fuel line through the sheet metal.

I am getting ready to put my engine back in my 58 panel and noticed that
there
are no grommets for the fuel line and the electrical through the firewall.
Anyone know where to get these?
