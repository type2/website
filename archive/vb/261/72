Basically you just remove the bumper brackets and mount the hitch in
their place. The bumper then mounts to the hitch (which replaces those
brackets). This is why I'm not sure if it would work on a splitty; while
the splitty bumper and the 68-71 bumper are virtually identical, they
mount differently.  The hitch is a copy of the European VW one that was
once offered, and uses the hitch-ball mount design that is common in
Europe, where there is a vertical (not horizontal) mount for the ball,
and the ball is sort of L-shaped so that it mounts to the plate
vertically. A 2" ball is included. Other sizes are not readily available
because this sort of ball mount method is not generally used in the U.S.
However, I have had some customers who took theirs to a trailer place
and had a receiver welded to the metal plate.
