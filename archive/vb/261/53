I have learned after trying to buy lug bolts and getting the wrong size that I have 68-70 drums on the rear (larger lug bolt)

What else does this mean was swapped besides the drum? I only have real experience with the 73-79 composite rear drums. I'd like to know what year parts I need to order for future reference.

As for the damaged threads, I thought perhaps I could chase them with a thread cleaner or tap/die. I guess a metric tap/die kit of that size might be more expensive than the drum tho, huh?

thanks, as always,
