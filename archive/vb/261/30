Now it's 1001...

If you drive it....do it.

Today....while moving some garage stuff into our new house....I cruised along 
at 75....engine purring and turning under 4000 rpms.

I have purred along the freeway at 80+ with no strain or overheating......Im 
so goddamned happy with this set up it aint even funny!

Oh yeah..the setup is a 3:88 Rancho big nut tranny and a super sweet 1800 
stroker....no external coolers and not even close to overheating.  The past two 
weeks have been 100 to 104 degrees and Ive been running this just as hard as 
always.

Now  when I ran the 3:88 and the 1600 DP......I was pleased on the 
flats..cruised comfortably at 62-65..with plenty of go....had her up to a little over 70 
at times.  But the fuggin hills pissed me off every time....even the very 
slight grades.  In addition...the gap between 3rd and 4th was a killer too....Id 
have to run it up to almost 50mph in 3rd to get a smooth shift to 4th.  The 
1800 has compensated for that too.

Do yourself a favor if you you run the 3:88 and dont go any smaller than a 
1776 and youll be a happy sumbitch.
