Subject: Freeway Flyer Tranny

Hi list,
This question has probably been asked a thousand times:

Planning on putting in a fresh 1600 sp into my 67 Sundial Camper.  I want to
also redo the tranny with a 3.88 ring & pinion.  I have a friend who is a vw
mechanic who is trying to talk me out of this combination.  He states that
the higher gear ratio will make it hard for me to climb hills with my bus.
While I know that this is probably true, most of my driving in So. Cal is
generally on pretty flat freeways.  The benefit of getting better mileage
and my engine turning fewer rpms on the freeway seems to outweigh the
occasional hill that I might encounter.  But I also tend to drive on 3-4
lane surface streets with 40-45 mph speed limits.  I occasionally drive my
bus, which now has a 1600 sp with a stock tranny in 4th gear occasionally on
these streets.  I wonder if the freeway flyer 4th gear will be too high for
this type of driving?  Anyone have any experience/recommendations for this.
I'm not willing to go to a larger engine, as I like the simplicity and
reliability of a 1600.

Thanks,
Ed Richardson
