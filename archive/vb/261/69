Subject: Re: [VB] engine heating up/timing question

Thanks to all who have reponded, I'm going to check the compression ratio
today...and I'm going to set the advance at 30 degrees at 3000 rpm or
whnever it stops advancing.  Mybe I'm a little paranoid about the temp....I
have a temp meter , if i can find it, that hooks to my fluke meter, and i
can check the block temp ....don't know why i didn't think of that earlier!
I'll keep you posted!!
thanks everybody!
Jason
