I have a hitch that bolts around the rear torsion tube, and has thingys that 
bolt to the bumper brackets that just keep the rear of the hitch from falling 
down, the weight gets pulled from the torsion bar.  swap meet find.  There are 
various kinds out there, some bolt to the center of the rear bumper, with an 
inner piece the shape of teh inside of the rear bumper.

 Suppose the hitch I bought from Bus Depot for a 71 will mount???  nope, me
 either.

hm.   I doubt it.   Well, the bay buses that came with hitches I think had 
extra metal welded in there.   seems the torsion bar is stronger though.

 How about the exhaust.  Will I need a stock exhaust??? >>

the hitch I have doesn't get in the way of a stock exhaust.  PITA to pull the 
motor though
