My '64 had these covers over the channels as well, and they were held
on by hose clamps at either end.  It did leave a bit of a gap along
the seam of the covers, but it worked OK.  (I took them off when I
installed later-model heat exchangers with larger diameter outlets,
which require different tubes from the heat exchangers to the body.)

Some of the VDO gauges might.  They have a few that are made to work
with Beetle senders (Cockpit 301 020, Cockpit Royale 301 736), but I
don't know if the Bus senders have the same resistance range or not.
You might ask VDO for more information: autotechsupport(-at-)vdo.com

Otherwise...get another original gauge at a swap.  (I don't know if
anyone sells them new.)  Keep track of your mileage and take a 1 to
5 gallon fuel jug along in case you run out.  Empty the tank, stick
a long metal rod down the fuel filler neck, and put in 1 gallon at
a time, filing notches on the rod as you go.  (Don't laugh too loud...
VW offered an accessory "fuel gauge" at one time that was exactly
this - a stick with lines on it.)
