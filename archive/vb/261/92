Hi Kevin,
Just converting to 12 volt is not the magic ansewer to your problems.  We 
converted our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion to 12 volt and still had 
voltage droppage problems that caused dim yellow headlights and other problems.  
Only when we went through the wiring systems of this bus and our 1963 SC still 
running 6 volts did we get white bright H-4 headlights in both buses.
  Also make sure to check that the headlight wiring is connected correctly.  
Our 1961 bug had a fender removed sometime before we had it and the DPO wired 
that headlight backward when it was put back together so as to run both 
filaments in both headlights at the same time.  Result was more like having kerosene 
lamps for lighting.
