When you get the good rivets, I believe, if my memory serves me
correectly, that the first little bit of rivet forming starts with a round
convex surface, as if you were pressing the end of the rivet with a large
ball bearing. That serves to send the edges outward. Then a
flat-to-concave piece of hard steel should finish the forming process on
the end of the rivet. THis all happened  9 years ago, and was over in a
flash as well. You can prolly get away with a careful and aware use of the
vise grip (10" size is better than the 7" for this, plus you need it in
your tool kit anyway), and a small flat piece of steel for the forming
surface. Get several extra rivets, and practice til you get the technique
down. Then your riveted windows will look pro.
