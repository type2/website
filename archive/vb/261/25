Yes, but it's Sunday, so we'll let you off! Go with the Freeway Flyer -
it's an intersting experience, and eventually you'll get a 1600 with
043 Dual Port heads, and maybe 90.2 cylinders, a very light upgrade
actually, resulting in a 1691 or something silly like that, which is what
I have going for decades. With a 34PICT carb, vacuum distrib, and the nice
exhaust header thingee that comes out of the heater boxes, heads to the
rear and meets in a single large under-bus muffler, you're set up like me.
And my Freeway Flyer works fine with that engine. I can often get to 61
mph going up the Glendale Freeway from the 134.
