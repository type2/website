It may not be the correct pedal pressure, but when I put my foot into those
new 24mm pistons where 22mm ones used to be, I stop!

1-2  going on 2 years with the brasilian MC from wolfgang, and thier spacer
kit.
No problems, went in without a problem. Ive heard from old timers its not
the right
way to do it and a proper 67 mc has better pedal pressure, etc, but it works
and the price is right. Note you need the resevior too (i had a dead 67 mc)
