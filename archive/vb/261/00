Subject: Brake knocking

My front right brake on my '62 is making a knocking sound when I apply
the brake.  The frequency of the sound slows in proportion to the trucks
road speed.  I did a complete brake system rebuild about two years ago
and a check about 6 months ago and all was well.  Any idea what this
might be??

Thanks.

Steve
