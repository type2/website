do you have any feedback on how this hitch works?   Just cause I have seen 
bumpers with tow hitches added (and reinforcements on the bumper & brackets, 
(heck the 54 kombi had one, it was used on a farm) and I didnt think it was such 
a great idea for hauling things, as the metal for the bumper brackets is not 
hurky duty.  I have seen damage there.   For light tows it would be okay, like 
a small single wheel trailer.
   It's just that usually i towed a bus (rescue missions) with my tow hitch.  
Once a bug 500 miles from Idaho, and if your torsion tube breaks the whole 
bus was a basket case anyway.

The original bay tow hitch went if I remember right under/in front of the 
apron, and had bolts that threaded to the sides.  There were things welded under 
there with the  factory installed version.  Hope it makes sense the way I am 
describing it, it was a long time since I found that bay tow hitch though.
