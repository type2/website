Hey VOLKS:

Just a few more days until HCBF 7 arrives........I will be heading out on
Wednesday morning and won't be able to check email after that time.

I have hired an AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHER who will do a fly over on Saturday
around 2-3pm weather permitting

If you would like to lead a carabus from your area to HCBF check out the
CARABUS LIST.  If you do not want to register to add your name on the list,
email me your info and I can post it for you:
