I found these the other day http://www.omega.com/ppt/pptsc.asp?ref=RLC-50 -
I had seen them on aquariums, but I didn't know they were made in higher
temperature ranges as well.  I wonder if these would be an accurate and
cheap way to measure VW engine case temperature?  Has anybody ever tried
it?

It might be interesting to stick a few on different parts of a case (below
generator pedestal, on oil plate, etc) to see what happens.  It seems like
the 90-120 C in 5 C steps (194-248 F in 9 F steps) would be the right range.

On the other hand, they can only measure the surface temperature and you
can't read them remotely.  Also I wonder if the adhesive would stick well
to the sand-cast surface of a VW case.  Spit always works, unless you've
been eating saltines all day.  :)
