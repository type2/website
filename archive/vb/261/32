 I'm not willing to go to a larger engine, as I like the simplicity and

You will find the bus goes okay on the flat, except less acceleration, but 
loses power on  hills and carrying a load.  less oomph.   That's what I found 
with my 65 westy, with a 1600sp, and also with the current mystery motor 1600DP 
with header (to fit around the oilfilterpump). I am not impressed with the 
3.88.  

There is this one hill, turning off I-5 onto 101 where there is a curve, and 
you have to slow down to ~40-45 in a bus (sign says 40) then go up a hill and 
get to freeway speeds.  Of course, this is the bottom of 4th gear, where it's 
hard to accelerate up the hill, so yesterday with the swap stuff in the 65 
westy on the way back from the Bug In  I dropped it in 3rd and went up to 50 in 
3rd to the top of the hill.  (Anywheres I don't leave it in 4th under forty 
unless flat or downhill, not even a slight uphill incline.)  Many cars go slow up 
that hill, not just VWs.    
    What amazed me was that Saturday coming back from the Vintage meet with 
the load of parts in the 67 Riviera it pulled the hill just fine at 55 in 4th 
gear.  Didn't miss a beat.   Amazing.  And through Nisqually both ways.  (The 
reason I took the westy to the Sunday meet is a different story and.)

 I have been planning for a while to build a full flowed 1679 SP for the 65, 
but have not yet got around to assembling the parts.   With a machined case 
and heads it has thicker cylinders than a 1600.   Never buildt a bigger motor 
before, so I guess see how it goes.  if I assemble it.  I mean when.  

basically, you would probably want a bigger motor for the bigger gearing.
