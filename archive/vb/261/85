Hi Gtilby,
According to our "1960 through 1970 Without Guesswork" the oil pressure 
switch opens somewhere between 2.1-6.4 psi!!!  So your oil pressure is border line. 
 Do check the relief valve/s and the spring/s for this/these correct length/s 
loaded and load.  From our experience your idle pressure should be more about 
10 psi even with oil temp as high as 220F with 30 Wt..
  We had an opposite problem with a new SP DR 1641 CW engine when it would 
not go below 60psi in 70F weather.  Turned out the rear relief valve spring was 
an aftermarket super strong long one!!
