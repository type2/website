Subject: my new bus

So I saw this bus about 5 years ago but it wasn't for sale.  The owner bought
it in 81 and it sat in a garage since then - he did drive it - but he put
about 60,000 kms on it since 81.  Now it has 60,000 miles on it.  He died in
February and I dropped a few hints to his family that I was interested if they
decided to sell.  They did and ... I bought it.  I had it safetied in Manitoba
but it didn't pass.  Then my father-in-law had a few problems with it dying so
he took it to a local garage to have it looked it.  They figured it was a fuel
pressure regulator so I bought one here in Eastern Ontario and shipped it off
and they put it on.  I flew to Manitoba a few weeks ago and picked it up and
drove it to Eastern Ontario.  I had a few problems on the way but nothing
serious.  It was about a 2,000 km drive and ... I'm happy.  Anyway - I wasn't
really interested in a fool injected type 4 engine - but - I could not turn
this bus down.  I figure I got a very good deal - 6 K Canadian - maybe 4 US.
I must say - as much as I love driving my 60 it is nice cruising in this bus.

Vintage bus content - I've been sanding my roof lately and I recently found a
16" sanding block - wow - does my roof look good.
