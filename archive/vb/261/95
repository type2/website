Taylor - 
I have had the square hole in the dust cover "round out" on me, so that it is 
not touching the cable and driving the speedo anymore. The good news is, the 
dust covers for the pre-disk brak bays will work fine, so you should be able 
to find a new one in the pick and pull, if that is the problem . . .

Good luck and happu VWing -
Greg
