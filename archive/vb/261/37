Hi Ed,
We would recommend the 3.875 R&P FF tranny!  We are running a 1641SP CW 
engine in our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion and it definitely made a huge 
differance in being able to keep up with 60 MPH traffic.  Even in our 1963 SC 
running a 40 HP big bore engine it helped alot, but that combo is definitely 
underpowered!  Some hills you are going to be able to climb better than your 
stocker tranny and some you will not.  For instance our 3rd gear at 3,000 RPM 
went from a stock 33ish MPH to 44MPH, so some hills that were too steep for 
fourth now we now can climb faster in third.  Biggest problem with recommending 
this tranny is volks vary in thier need for power/speed.  Worse comes to worse 
you can upgrade later to a bigger engine if you find the FF tranny is too much 
for your 1600SP and power/speed needs.  Make sure the tranny rebuilder does 
not allow any gaps between the gearing that pushes the engine RPMs below 1,500 
or very little above 3,000 RPM.
