Subject: Re: [VB] engine heating up/timing question

You cannot set the timing at idle, or static time when you are running a 009
distributor. Total advance is what you want to set, which I would set at
between 30 and 32 degrees. Too advanced, and the heads run hot, but too
retarded, and the exhaust port runs VERY hot, which will drop a valve seat
in no time.

I've seen engine's set to 28 degree's max advance with a 009 and the exhaust
manifolds glow bright orange. Set those same engine's to 32 degrees while
running, and within seconds, they cool back down.

Being too retarded, even by a few degrees, can be very bad for your motor,
and since 009's vary in thier total amount of advance, setting it at idle
can put you anywhere between 25 and 35 degrees at full advance. (I've seen
both ends of the spectrum).
