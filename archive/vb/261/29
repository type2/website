Subject: Re: [VB] Freeway Flyer Tranny

I've got a 1600 sp in my bus with a 3.88 r & p freeway flyer.  If you insist
on going with a 1600 sp, you'll need to do some performance upgrades (dual
carbs, header, maybe some ratio rockers, etc..) as a 1600 sp just really
don't have quite enough power for such tall gearing (in my opinion).  But
mine is still my daily driver and gets me around town just fine.  The only
thing is at 40-45 mph, i'm still in third gear, turning about 35-3800 RPM.
There's just no power in 4th at that speed (you'll be at about 2000-2300 RPM
at that speed in fourth).  I'd defenitely recommend the 3.88 freeway flyer,
it's awesome for highway driving.
