Random ideas...

- What weight of oil are you running?  If these results are with
  20W-50 then you may not be able to do much, but otherwise, you
  could try a heavier oil - straight 30 weight, straight 40 weight
  (kind of hard to find), 20W-50.

- Check the other valve at the front of the engine.  If you can,
  check the spring length against the numbers in the "Without
  Guesswork" manuals at http://wow.atlasta.net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ .
  If you don't like what you find, replace with stock real VW
  springs instead of aftermarket.

- Is the oil pump pickup tube snug?  When you change the oil,
  grab the end of the tube (or stick a socket extension in it,
  etc) and try to move it around...if it wiggles very easily,
  it might be causing the oil pump to suck air sometimes.

- Are you running a spin-on filter?  If so, change filter brands
  (to anything but Fram) and see what happens.

Good luck!
