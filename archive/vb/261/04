Hi Steve,
Sounds like something coming loose.  The only way to find out is to take that 
brake apart and check everything.
  A friend of our replaced the Tranny and did not retorque everything a 
hundred miles later as we suggested.  Turned out one of the RGBs was about to fall 
loose from the swing plate.  Retorqued the bolts and turned out one of the 
bolt holes had been stripped due to the vibration!
