Subject: Tow Hitch

Ok vintage nuts, I now know I need a transmission.  next question.....

How do you folks mount a hitch on your split windows??  I have a 60 and a 66.

Suppose the hitch I bought from Bus Depot for a 71 will mount???  nope, me
either.

How about the exhaust.  Will I need a stock exhaust???

Thanx again.


Kind Regards,
