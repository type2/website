Subject: RE: [VB] firewall grommets

These grommets are NOT safe! They dry up and fail easily, and then the tin
begins to cut thru the steel fuel line, causing fire. I heartily recommend
slitting a short length of VW rubber fuel line lengthwise, as Clara and
others have said, sliding it over the steel line and thru the hole in the
tin - it will last forever, and never will get cut thru.
