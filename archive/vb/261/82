Subject: Re: [VB] Big 6v generator

As already noted, this is a '66 only part.  I believe that Karmann 
Ghias also used this generator ('66 only as well).  Please note: This 
generator uses a different regulator than the normal skinny 6v 
generators.

A side note:

Some Porsche 356 models used a 12v generator which is the same diameter 
as, and will interchange with, skinny VW 6v generators.  The only way 
to make a 12v car with a 36 horse engine???...
