If you are running a dual relief block, or even a single relief, I would check
both oil pressure piston and pressure relief piston and make sure it is
traveling freely in its tube.

Hi all,
I have exhausted every form of information I have and
still can't find an answer to this problem.  I have a
1641 dual port and for some reason the oil light comes
on at idle after the engine heats up to about 180
degrees.  I originally thought that maybe the oil pump
wasn't creating the pressure that it should be so I
took it in and had it tested and that isn't the
problem.  At idle it had about 7lbs. of pressure.
