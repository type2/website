Subject: Re: [VB] Tom Bowman, Aridzona

I am picking up this thread via various pmails. Am not familiar with details at
this writing.

Ironically, I have not thought of Tom in a few years but just this afternoon
observed a father and his pre-teen son who reminded me of Tom. With no
intention of putting on airs or conjuring stuff that does not exist, I
reflected on Tom's character, reputation of integrity, ultimate honesty and
example of being a father as well as a gentleman. Frankly, I remembered that
Tom was always quietly involved in martial arts yet projected a very gentle
hand. Strength on several planes for sure...

If at all possible, I will be at the service physically. Definitely in spirit.
