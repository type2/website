Yes.  Behind the passenger seat, close to the front passenger door.

The chassis number is *probably* stamped in the body sheet metal near
the engine.  Open the engine lid and look at the flat surface between
the engine and the battery.  There is a seam that runs at an angle from
the engine seal towards the battery.  The number *might* be stamped on
the forward side of this seam.

There also *might* be a plate on the passenger side of the fresh air
housing, in the ceiling of the cab, with some information.

These may or may not be there, depending on year and whether the PO cut
them out.
