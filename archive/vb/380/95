I like that idea!  Actually, you could probably just replace the float
bowl plug with a suitably-sized hose fitting and run a length of
fuelproof clear tubing up the side of the bowl; the level in the bowl
and tubing should be equal (Pascal's law?) Of course this would only
be for troubleshooting and setting float height, the regular plug
would be swapped back for normal use.
