When you turn on the hazard flashers, this light flashes in phase with
the exterior lamps.  It shouldn't flash with the turn signals.  It is
in parallel with the coil of the hazard relay.  On my '64, there is a
long white or light grey wire running from the hazard relay to this
light.  It looks like it grounds through its mounting.
