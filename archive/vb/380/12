Seth,

 From what you have described, the only drawback I can see in doing so 
would be small chips getting between the case halves. I would give it a 
try though. Make sure that the helicoil is installed deep enough so that 
it is only in the proper case half and not positioned between the two 
halves. I would say you have a fair to good chance of success on this 
type of repair. Use caution where any thin areas of the case exist. 
Magnesium fractures easily.
