Hi Dave

Recently i found in a metal shop here, 13 new never user before original 
front bumpers for split bus. The problem is that im in Brazil south america, 
and i believe wil be expensive to send it to you. Im not at my city now and 
i will be there tomorow, them i can send you pics of the bumpers. ( i 
recently had used one on my restoration project that i will show you soon)

Also i can try to find the right cost to send it to USA. I will let all you 
volks know, just in case someone also need it.

Is there any source in North America for new reproduction bumpers.  I have
seen a few used and banged up ones on "thesamba" but most people won't ship
and everything that looks decent is on the East coast and would cost me a
fortune to take time off work to go get them.

Thanks
Dave Johansen
