<<Many use gaskacinch, but I believe it's the same as contact cement.>>



It's a real light weight , thin contact cement--

Now if you want that gasket to stick no one side of that gasket---

Locate some Caterpillar High Tack.
Cat parts carries it.
Excellent valve cover glue---no leaks anyway or slipping gaskets----
