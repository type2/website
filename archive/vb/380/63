You mean that cutoff valve that hooks into both lines from the pump?  I've
never seen one of those things ourside of pictures!  I don't think they
worked well to start with, since they disappeared so fast.  Hang onto it,
as they seem to be rare.

The carb float valve seems work fine as long as it is is in good
condition.  Problem is, one can be in poor shape for a long time as long
as the bus is driven daily.  If you let it sit for a while, particularly
with a full tank and with the nose up, you will get enough seepage to
either fill a cylinder (hydrolock) or the crankcase (pushed out front
seal).  Neither situation is good.  For a full crankcase, the answer is
to drain and refill with new oil.  For hydrolock the answer is to remove
the plugs, turn the engine over a few times by hand (_not_ with the
starter, unless you really like fire!) to clear the cylinder.  Let the
gas dry, reinstall the  plugs, and fire it up.

I always make it a habit to check the oil before firing up a VW that has
been sitting for more than a couple of days.  Cheap insurance.
