Subject: Re: [VB] summer is here!!

No, I thinvintk it is quite cool. 
My singlecab runs very cool, or at least my oil temp says so. I have never seen a temp over 210 even in the 90's of summer and generally it is between 180 and 200.
I run  29050 castrol and I just know that I need to put in new bearings sometime.
But when I bought the thing I have a complete running 1600 DP with transmission and a new long block. 
 
It just is procrastination that stops me getting down to it, as there are no knocking noises.

Hi Sam,
What oil temp are you running?  Could be too high and thinning it too  much.  
BTDT!
