For a long time, Japanese cars usually also had a sight glass for the
A/C refrigerant level.  Imagine that... you can just wipe the dirt away
from a little window and look, instead of buying a set of gauges...

I think you might be right about NPT; if you used a fitting with a
flange and a rubber gasket on the outside, and a nut on the inside, it
might work.

I wonder if you could machine a fitting to go in the main jet holder
and/or float bowl plug hole?  I'm thinking something like a brass rod
with the right threads on one end and a hole in the side for a press-fit
glass tube.

It'd be kind of hard to calibrate, but you might also be able to stick a
piece of stiff wire down the bowl vent tube and non-surgically figure out
where the float level is.
