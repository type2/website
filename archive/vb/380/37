Subject: Lower left control on speedo pod?

I am sorting out the wiring in my '65 panel, and found, not one, not two,
but three kill switches!!

Unfortunately, one of the switches caused a hole to be drilled in the
dash. Gotta fill that one.

But, the question is:

What switch/control/etc. is mounted on the lower left side of the speedo
"pod"? I don't have the manual yet, and there is no other handy splittie
around to go look at.

I could find any good pics on the Samba to assist figuring this one out.

Thanks,

Jon
