I would think the toy/literature show would be a better place to look for
that hydrogen powered rocket as the Hilton's right next door to LAX for
take-off/launch purposes......:-D

You can always find the "weird" stuff at the toy/literature show - been to
every one of 'em since it started eons ago.  I'll be aimlessly wanderin'
around at both events.

I'll keep my eyes open when I am there this weekend-should I look at the toy
show or in the swap section the next day?
