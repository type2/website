Hmm... the wiring diagrams say either a red or a black/purple stripe
wire.  http://vintagebus.com/wiring/ will be handy even after you get
your Bentley, because the diagrams in the Bentley reprints are B&W.

Correct - it would come through the base of the pod, *unless* the Bus had
the optional steering/ignition lock, in which case it would still be on
the right, but under that bracket that holds the steering column to the
bottom lip of the dash.  In this case I *think* there was a plastic plug
in the hole in the pod where the stock ignition switch would have gone.
