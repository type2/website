Hi AZ,
If you are not worried about the year and even month the speedo was made,  
and just need something that looks right and works right.  The 1961-63 bus  
speedo will fit that.
  Try Thesamba.com for the "Classifieds" there and do a "Search" for  
"Speedometer" & "Speedo".  Also remember that VW since 1955 changed  model years at 
or near the beginning of AUG.  So say a 10.60 stamped speedo  will be for a 
1961.
  There is also a fellow who advertises speedometer repair.
  BTW make sure to check out the "Trip Speedometers"!!
