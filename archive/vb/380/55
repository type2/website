You probably would have seen it when swapping the manifolds, but I *think*
some (non-stock-type?) mufflers come with the heat riser openings blocked -
they are there but you have to remove a plug or drill them out.

Well, you know that the parts are new, but you don't know if they're
working right.  :)  You might put your old parts back on this Bus to
see if anything changes, or put the SVDA/CompuFire on a known-working
VW to make sure they are OK.

At least in the US, you can get the throttle shaft holes re-bushed for
something like US$20-$40 at a carburetor shop.  Any machine shop should
be able to do it if you bring them the carb body and the throttle shaft,
but it will be more expensive to have them do it.

Also, had the original carb ever sat with gas in it for more than a few
weeks?  This can clog up the passages in any carb; I have heard, but
cannot verify, that it was more of a problem on later carbs (like the
34s) that have more and smaller internal passages.  I've had to soak a
gunked-up VW carb in solvent a couple of times, several hours each time,
to get it totally clean.

It was almost certainly jetted for a Bug out of the box.  Compared to a
stock Bug of the same year, the stock Bus carb has a smaller main jet,
a smaller air correction jet, possibly a larger pilot jet, possibly a
larger auxiliary fuel jet, and a smaller power fuel jet (== accelerator
pump squirter?).

How about the other jets?  What size jets are in it now?

Bentley calls for 17 to 19 mm from the top; being a quarter-inch lower
than that sounds like a lot to me.  I'm not sure how much not having a
gasket would help, as Bentley says they only vary 1 mm between thickest
and thinnest.  On the other hand, maybe the Pierburg carburetor is
different enough for these specifications not to apply.

I also second Arnaud's idea that maybe the fuel in the bowl is leaking
off somewhere, or possibly the bowl isn't getting filled all the way by
the fuel pump.  Like he said, check the level some morning before you
start it, and if it's still low, manually add a little, reassemble the
carb, and then try starting it.
