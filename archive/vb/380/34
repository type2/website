Subject: Shifting Issues

Clara's post reminded me that my 60 pickup has been very stiff in recent
weeks when I shift it, like it needs lubrication.  I've no trouble
finding a gear, but it's really stiff shifting into all gears.  Is there
a place to lubricate it or is something else going on?

Thanks for any info.
