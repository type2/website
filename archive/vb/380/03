Nipples or tubes on which the ends are flared to a larger diameter.  You
push the hose over the beads and then put the clamp on the other side of
the beads.  The beads provide a mechanical stop to prevent the hose from
pulling off the tube.

Here is a picture of beaded tubes and the tools needed to accomplish
this.  You can also braze a wire around the end of the tube to achieve the
same effect.
