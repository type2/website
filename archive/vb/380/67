Hi Jon,
We have never seen a fuel pump with a cut off valve, only one way  valves.  
The carb is the only part of the fuel system that has a needle  valve in the 
top section to shut off fuel when the float inside pushes up on  it.  Plus later 
carbs the electromagnetic fuel shut off valve to  shut off the idle to 
prevent run on when engine is shut down.
