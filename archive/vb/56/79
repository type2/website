Subject: Re: [VB] problems installing rear window on double cab  help  help

I recall having to exert a supreme amount of effort on the rear window in my 62 double cab. I had the entire seal/frame heavily lubed with go-jo, friend inside to unwind the string, and was practically ramming it with my shoulder to get it in. It took almost an hour, but it finally went in. I was rather frightened that I would smash it, but it held up splendidly. Good luck...
