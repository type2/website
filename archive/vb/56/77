Subject:  Re: [T2] Marvel Mystery Oil (was oil additive advise)

Dad used to use it regular in his v-8's and i have used in some of mine for
sticky lifters (mostly damn fe block fords), The most amazing thing dad did
was free up stuck vw engine by filliing the cyclinders with MMo and just
letting it sit. He'd walk by couple times a week and push on the crank
pulley nut with a 2 ft breaker bar. On one particular engine he finally
freed it after it had been sitting for 15 years. I suppose the age i was
first introduced to it was around 70 if not before, Yea i'm getting to be an
old fart, and as ugly as the north end of a south bound mule but thats life
i guess ,,later Grin
