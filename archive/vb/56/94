found out the hard way a long time ago (got super hot and melted the grease 
out of the bearings and siezed up the generator) about having 2 plastic 
covers on. the air gets sucked in through the bottom hole on the generator 
and should be vented through the backing plates. >>

Actually the 6 volt generators sucked air through the generator and through 
the large round holes in the rear disc of the cooling fan and used a dished 
gen to shroud tin.  The later 12 volt system blew air through the generator 
from the air passages in the non-dished generator to fan shroud tin.  So 
there are no large round cooling holes through the later fans, just two small 
ones probably for alignment during manufacture.  When installing the wider 
later cooling fans on 6 volt generators we drill those two small holes bigger 
to get some cooling sucked through the generator.   Still definitely a good 
idea to have at least the lower brush port open to allow this flow!
