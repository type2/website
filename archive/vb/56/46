Subject: Vintage Bus Hit counter

What does that say about the VW community when you go to www.vintagebus.com
and look at the top search counts for hits on Everett's site and you sill
see that there are over 4000 hits for both 'For sale' and 'porn'!!  The next
closest count is 2000 for 'lowered'.  Either people that like VW's also like
porn or Everett has a page that he keeps private and it is his hit counter
showing up on the site too.  Hey I am not looking to buy another VW so I
guess I am not pointing a finger at anyone but me.  Hell I think that I have
only looked at Everett's porn 200 or so times so I know that I am not alone
out there.  What I think is really sick is those people that are looking for
a for sale VW in the dark with the glow of their monitor giving their naked
body kind of a bluish tone excited by a low mileage original paint in the
next town over.  Hey that sounds like me too.  (I am not naked though)
Keep those hit counters going and lets see who wins at the end of the year.
Maybe I will start looking for another bus too just to balance the hit
counter!!!   <:^{)>
