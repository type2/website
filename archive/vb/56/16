Subject: Re: [VB] WCM mis-representation

I bought a rubber seal for the vent flap a week ago, WCM product, it
also had no rivets despite bearing the same part number as the one in
their catalogue which said 14 rivets included! So I used a pop rivet
gun and the job was done pretty quick. I am just glad they make the
seal, because if I had to make it myself I doubt I would have got
around to doing it yet. And the new seal really helps keep heat in,
rain out, to me it is worth however much I overpaid for a piece of
rubber.
Thanks to your post I won't waste my money on 211-810, so that's a
tiny blow to them.

I am a little angry at WCM. I am redoing my overhead
flap system and I ordered the 211-810 "body seal", in
there diagram it shows the piece as a
vertical/horizontal/vertical, what I got was a
straight piece of foam core door rubber. My question
is that, was the original seal a 1 piece unit, or was
it 3 pieces. I couldnt find a diagram of it on the
online parts book. Anyone know how much foam core
rubber is a foot? And I also ordered the 211-757 seal
fresh air flap w/14 rivets and it came sans rivets.
 Mike
