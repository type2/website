Stock, your Bus wouldn't have had the "9 prong box" - it would have
had a four-pronged relay, item J1 in the wiring diagram.  See this

This is inherent in the design and there's not much you can do about
it.  A strategically placed diode would fix it, but would also introduce
another 0.6v to 1.0v voltage drop to your brake lights.  If your Bus
is still 6 volt, this means your brake light brightness would be reduced
by 30% to 50%.  A 12 volt Bus would fare a bit better and "only" lose
17% to 30% or so.  Since you need your brake lights more than your
hazard flashers, it's a reasonable trade-off.
