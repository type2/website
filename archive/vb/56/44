Subject: RE: [VB] more ridiculous prices

Hey, I'd pay outrageous prices for a nice pair of original or NOS rear
tranny mounts or an og one eyed duck... to each his own.  It is ransom but
some parts are few and far between.... then again, I have met many nice
people that are very willing to ask very reasonable prices for those odd
ball parts and enjoy helping out a fellow busser complete their ride.

... maybe the person asking the big bucks has that much into the parts
already????
