Subject: Engine Lid & Apron from RMMW's???`

Anyone ever bought the Rear Aprons and Engine lid from Rocky Mountain Motor
Works?  After finding hinges to hang the deck lid I got from a 67.  I found
that the rear apron and decklid have a bad "twist" in them.

Anyone have these two parts For Sale?

Dave
