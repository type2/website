Subject: first post(was question for a friend)

Howdy all..This is my first post to the list. I used to be on the list a few 
years back but after selling my 67 Westfalia(which I regretted from day 1) I 
was splittless..Ahh, feels good to be sitting behind the wheel of a splitty 
again!! I traded my 71 camper for a 66 camper(thanks for the great trade 
John!) Anyway, John had posted asking questions about why my bus had lost 
all electrical power. It was doing nothing..I mean, would'nt crank, no 
interior lights, headlights..nothing. I figured it was just that battery and 
i took it out and had auto zone check it out..it was fine. Anyway, after a 
lot advice from John, my friend Bob, and from some of the emails you guys 
sent that John forwarded me..she's running great again!! It turned out that 
the wires going to the starter were loose and not making a connection..after 
I tightened that down..boomj! I had power!! However,
the bus still would'nt start. I took the button out(this bus is rigged where 
you turn the key on the ignition and then press a button to get it 
started)..anyway, all the wires on the button were secure and tight. John, 
said it was probably a wire going to the selenoid. Sure enough, there was a 
wire disconnected..hooked it up..bus fired right up!! The good behind this 
is I did it myself(with they help of all you)..before, I did'nt even know 
what a selenoid was..much less where it was. It took me a bit longer to 
finally get everything back to working order(troubleshooting) than it would 
the normal guy but hey, it was my first attempt..Now, it is time to go to 
the next step..replacing a wheel cylinder, bleeding and adjusting the 
brakes..wish me luck..I sure hope i can do it! thanks for your help.
