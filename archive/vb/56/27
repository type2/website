Well, if you've checked the timing, the battery, points, plugs, valves,
distributor cap, rotor, wires, ignition coil (by the color of the spark, a
white/blue spark is great, a yellow is kinda weak), and that you're getting
fuel (get one of those temporary semi-clear fuel filter, and if it stays
full, or mostly full while running, you're probably getting good amounts of
fuel).  I would the do a compression check, and if you have the means, a
leakdown test, and see what those numbers are.  As our little engines get up
in the years, the rings tend to get weak, and the valves don't seal quite
like they should, we lose power, and it could cause harder starts.

I've really been having a tough time starting my bus these days.  I just
keep turning it over again, and again and again and again and again and
eventually it starts.  I set the points, the timing, etc.. it just takes a
long time to get it running?  I drove my bus last winter on occasion and it
wasn't near this tough to get started and it was much colder than these last
couple of days.  Once it's running and warm it will restart ok but it's that
initial started that's a b*tch. I'm running 20-50 oil and I'm thinking about
going to 5 - 30 for the winter (not that I'll drive my bus much anyway in
the winter).  I wonder if that will help?

Ideas appreciated.
