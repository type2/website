Harry,

I think I figured out where one of the persistant leaks is located on
the Safari's. Examine the seam in the metal frame. It will provide a
small leak through the seal. If you finish the seam with a little
silicone seal or other rubbery compound, it will seal up against the
rubber seal. Try it and let us all know if it works.
