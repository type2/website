Hi Jdd,
If you really have a 40HP engine with it's non-casted into the case generator 
stand, then no!  If you have a Bastard engine with the non-casted generator 
stand and 36HP intake manifold then yes.  If you have a 36HP engine with cast 
into the engine case generator stand then yes.
  The 28 PCI just have too small of throat and differant mounting bolt 
pattern compared to the 40 HP engine intake manifold.  If you really want a 
manual choke use a Solex H-30-PIC made by Solex Borsol Ind. Brazil it has a 
24mm venturi which will work well for 1300-1641cc SP engines.  RMMW was 
selling these for $125.00 a while back and prehaps Ronnie has them for a lot 
less since RMMW is so pricey!  Or find the rare ZVW accessory to convert 
28PICT and later SP carbs to manual choke.
