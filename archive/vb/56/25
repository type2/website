So I got the old transmission in and it seems to work great but for a =
bit of a howl in second. I will never go to that kind of work on a used =
transmission again that is for sure.  Anyway, this one seems to be =
faster than mine in both 3rd and 4th gear.  When did VW stop making =
small nut transaxles? I guess there was different gearing between 60 and =
63? =20
