Subject: Re: [VB] 28 PCI


Could I put a 22.5 venturi in the PCI?  I really would like to make the PCI
work - I like the idea of a manual choke and my 60 has a knob for the manual
choke. So on the PCI the jet that is on the back side of the plug at the
bottom of the bowl that is the jet I'd have to change. And on the ventuiri -
the jet that I see when looking down into the assembled carb would have to
be changed - right?  Those are what need to be larger right?
