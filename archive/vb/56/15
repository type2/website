Subject: Hazard ahead

After maybe 9 months of bus ownership I finally got every damn switch,
button, knob whatever to work again on the '64 ratwagen. No, I'm
wrong, the waterpump doesn't work. The one on the camper kit fridge,
what other kind is there?
The thing that held me back for the longest time was the emergency
flashers, I just couldn't figure out a way to get all four turnsignals
to flash yet remain independent. (I don't have any special
many-pronged VW relay.) Tonight I saw the error of my ways and just
made the back two flash. Some odd effects, when the ignition is off
but the hazards on, and then the brake pedal is applied, the low oil /
generator lamps and the fuel gauge flash along with the hazards. I
think I know why but don't care to do anything about it.
I am just so pleased being able to make that mysterious, but very
important-looking, red light on the dash blink on and off by pulling
on a likewise mysterious knob, that is bus special.
