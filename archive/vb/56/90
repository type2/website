Yikes.  You're lucky you smelled that fire...you may well have toasted
that engine otherwise!  Without airflow, even if it IS 40 below, it doesnt
take long to toast those heads!

If that belt goes...STOP. (if that light comes on, too..you did see the
light, right? :)  Arizona or Alaska..or anywhere in between.  (40
below...lets see.  4-5 minutes tops? anything like the temps we have down
here in orlando this week?  1-1.5 minutes..)
