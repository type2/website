Subject: Re: [VB] problems installing rear window on double cab  help  help

Is this a freshly painted truck?  I had a hard time installing the solid 
windows on the sides of my 65 after painting- hard to set them to where I 
could pull the string.   Also the only time I did a truck window was on my 
Dad's SC,  and it was a real PITA.   (warm late summer day) I think it took 
two of us pushing to get that glass to set into the window area. It took way 
to much time messing with it.   If you have sekurit glass you can push pretty 
hard and the glass won't break.   The tempered glass flexes.  It's the 
laminated stuff you have to be really careful with, that stuff will crack not 
flex.

<< all ,
 
 I have tried three times to install the rear window and It won't go in it 
 seems that the seal is to fat . I ordered a seal from ronnie for a truck and 
 it is the same as the bus one .  SO WHY CANT'T I GET THE WINDOW TO SEAT 
WHERE 
 IT SHOULD ?
 I have installed several windows with no problems but the rear window of 
this 
 truck seems to be a big struggle.  any one have any hints or suggestions.  I 
 am using soap water and a string around the seal. But it is just to big to 
 get inside the lip.
 help please    John  65 double cab
