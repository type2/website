Ronnie is right, U-haul's equipment is junk. I rented the biggest moving van
they had earlier this year to move into my new house. I parked it on my
driveway which is kinda sloped and set their stupid "electronic E-brake".  I
unloaded the van and went to sleep. Came out in the morning and the U-haul
POS had rolled down the driveway into the back end of my wifes new 2000
jetta which was parked in the street. Although they did end up paying 500
bucks, the counter guy was amazed that the mechanic would have passed the
van off as being 'ok'.  He drove it up on some speed bumps with me, put it
in park, hit the electric E-brake, and it just rolled down right off em.. If
the E-E-brake failed, the tranny shoulda still held it in park but of course
it didn't cause it was junk. (what was someone just saying about not getting
stuck in an 'old technology rut' ? =)
They shoulda stuck to using hand pull ebrake cables.
