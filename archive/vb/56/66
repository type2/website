295464 = October '57
369810 = July '58

These are CHASIS numbers, the one from the engine compartment, not the BODY
number which is behind the front seat on the passenger side.  You'll need to
verify those are the numbers you sent.

Hi all,
   I have two early type 2's  both are registered as 1958, one with VIN #
295464 and the other 369810.  They are supposedly early '58 both have
pressed bumpers, the later is a camper.

  The 295464 bus has factory sunroof, ambulance partition, no skylights, and
is an 8 passenger bus with standard trim.  Can anyone help determine the
year of this one, possibly the option codes, or does anyone know where I can
find this information?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

-Dan
