Subject: tomorrow's excitement

Hi All,

I write this in great expectation.  Tomorrow, I take possession of a 67
single cab 'tipper' that I bought from BBT in Belgium.  It's been sitting at
the port of Tacoma since the 7th and I finally get to go up and get it after
a week of b-travel last week.  If anyone is interested, I'll get it around
2pm tomorrow afternoon. (keep your fingers crossed).  Show up at the port of
Tacoma and see a very unique type II.  (of course, I'm not sure what 'Port
of Tacoma' means... so those directions may be a bit vague).

A few of you knew of this purchased and I swear that I will not chrome any
bolt nor put any aftermarket go-fast goodies on this bus.  This one is to
use unlike the destiny of my double cab. (ok, Robert, I'm ready to go get
some gravel now :-)  )


A full trip report and posting of picture will follow on Tuesday.

Wish me luck

David
