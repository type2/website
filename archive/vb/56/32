 So I got the old transmission in and it seems to work great but for a bit of 
a howl in second. I will never go to that kind of work on a used transmission 
again that is for sure.  Anyway, this one seems to be faster than mine in 
both 3rd and 4th gear.  When did VW stop making small nut transaxles? I guess 
there was different gearing between 60 and 63?

63 was the last year they put the little nut RGBoxes in the bus.  There are 
different choices for the actual gears and the R&P,  they were used dif years 
and if the tranny you got was swapped or rebuilt at sometime you can't bet on 
what is in it, and I have heard from a tranny rebuilder that he didn't think 
the gears used stock were what the VW book said anyway the point is ya you 
easily could have a higher geared tranny than before.

Since you installed a used tranny, make sure you change the oil in a few 
hundred miles.  (you did give it new boots, right?)   Hey if this one goes 
bad, it'll be a lot easier to change it next time, as a lot of the work 
involved seems fighting rusties and crusties.   After you do it a few times 
and the bus goes together and apart like a new bus, you can drive the bus in 
the garage w/ bumper on and have the tranny out and RGBoxes/axles off in 3 
1/2 hours.

Wonder if the hard start problem is related to the tranny swap....   I'd 
check to make sure the trans ground strap is good and connected well, and 
that  the connections are nice & clean and tight on the starter, and the 
battery connections and  ground ditto.
