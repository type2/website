Subject: Re: [VB] 28PCI and bastards

Yes John, The bastard bus used a modified 28PCI.  It
was identical to a regular 28PCI but the fuel inlet
has a male connector for rubber fuel line instead of
the regular old screw in steel hose style used before.

That is only difference ,well maybe a jet change or
something but thats it.
