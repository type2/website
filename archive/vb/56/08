>what's so great about split weight oil anyway? 

Um...it goes with a split-window Bus?

I think one of the advantages of a straight weight oil is that it
doesn't do so well with temperature changes.  You are then forced
to drive your Bus to places where the weather matches your oil and
the camping is better.  Muir hinted at this: "As I have developed,
with time, a certain ability to keep myself out of temperature
extremes, my Bus has never had anything in it but 30 weight, S.A.E."
I always kinda figured this was more a suggestion on where to spend
your winters than on what kind of oil to run.
